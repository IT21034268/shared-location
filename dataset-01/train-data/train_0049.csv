1,Toshiba PDR-M60 Engineering,"I purchased my original PDR-M60 in January of 2001, and before February it was in the mail to be repaired. I ended up receiving a refurbished unit, without the reimbursement of my S&H. So everything was fine until Febraury of 2002, when my power button popped off. So again of to the mail with my S&H and time as if Toshiba were the only ones that run a business. Out of commission for over a month I recieved another refurbished unit. Now that I am out of my original warranty period of one year they refuse to repair/replace my camera that has another button that has popped off, without an additional $... for another refurbished unit. Why? So the button can pop off again? I think not. I think I'll learn to take my losses."
1,"Great camera, simple to use.",This is the second review as I have had the camera for sometime now. I have taken some killer photos with this camera and printed them on my HP 812C color inkjet.I strongly recommend you buy a 32 or 64 mb smart media card and NiMh batteries. The battery life is great with those batteries.Radio Shack sells an AC adapter at a very reasonable price for the PDR-M60.Go forth and shoot!
2,Toshiba pdr-m60 digital camera,"I recently purchased a Toshiba PDR - M60 digital camera. The first thing I noticed right out of the box was the bottom left area of the viewfinder had an obstruction as if a finger partially covered it. This never went away. The camera only comes with a partial owner's manual and to obtain the full length version you have to download it from the CD and it is 103 pages long. Another problem is the batteries discharged in a couple of days although the camera was in the off mode. If you buy a PDR-M60 be sure to immediately buy some rechargeable batteries and a charger and an AC adapter as battery life is very short when you connect the camera to your computer. I have to believe my camera was an anomoly as Toshiba is recognized for quality, nevertheless, I returned it and ordered a Canon s-10."
2,not so great,"I was impressed with the features in the store, but when I got it home the Toshiba was less impressive. It ran out of battery power very quickly. The viewfinder was obstructed by the camera body. The 4mb smartmedia card is far too small. And I kept looking for the manual -- but all it comes with is a useless reference guide that barely tells how to refill the batteries (a skill you will need to develop quickly!) Hold out for a better value."
4,Well Done,very well done and brings back good memories of Shawn. It is A Christmas present for my wife who loves him
2,"CAREFUL: Low cost, but also low quality","Radius Technology DVDs ID as ""OPTODISC"" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many ""coaster"" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata)."
4,From Michener to MGM: Tahitian Adventures in Paradise,"A short little book that is a bit naughty in places reminiscent of a Tennessee William's play. It does picture the beginnings of modernization in old Tahiti, while hearkening back to earlier times when the only way to Papeete was by boat. A keen insight into the reactions of the Polynesians to the modern world and the beginnings of a hybrid culture that moved from gratis open-sensuality to tourist profiteering, with some rousing tales of an assortment of adventure-seeking free-spirits who sought their own unsullied Eden. The reader is left with the impression that it might have been better if the jets had never arrived and the French had never come--then again--who can keep the handsome beauty of Tahiti from the rest of the world. And for a person that grew up watching Adam Troy in Adventures in Paradise--well, those days are gone forever."
3,"Oh, this is a good, sappy book!","I had enjoyed the first book that I read by this author (Magic Hour: A Novel), but I thought that was mostly due to the subject matter (feral children). This book shared similarities in that it too was about families and children. And also that the family was so unrealistic.Still, it was an enjoyable and certainly escapist-fast read. I will most likely read more by her - though I doubt I will ever pay full price.In many ways, this author is reminiscent of Jodi Picoult - though on a more superficial, beach-read type of level.Still, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sappy, sentimental-type book."
3,I had some issues with this story,"SPOILERS INSIDE!!This book was very readable, yet very predictable. The predictability didn't bother me so much as the ending. Yes I was happy that Angie & Con got back together. I knew David & Lauren didn't have a chance, but for Lauren to keep the baby and not take the scholarship??? STUPID! If she'd let Angie and Con adopt the baby they'd all be one big happy family and that's what I wanted.Loved the depiction of Italian family life. I am not Italian but grew up in a very Italian area and the DeSaria family seemed very realistic to me.I would definitely read more of Kristin Hannah's books."
3,Hannah is a great author,She may be getting lazy. I think she needs to start thinking up some other subject matter. There is alot going on in the world and her readers are tired of the same old same old Mother and Daughter conflicts.
2,Not her best work,"I love Kristin Hannah,,,usually! This book was a bit boring and predictable. I would not recommend! But many of her other books are wonderful."
5,Loved It!,"Well written and a fabulous story, couldn't put it down. Love the idea of huge families and all the support they provide!"
2,Not What I Expected From Kristen,"This book starts out great and is a wonderful story for about 95% of the book. And then, it takes a dramatic turn that is both outrageous and nonsensical, not to mention totally inconsistent with the character we learn to love throughout the book. The end is a profound betrayal to the characters and the reader, that turns what could have been a beautiful story into a taudry tale of selfishness, betrayal and poor judgment. I don't get it. Kristen is usually so good at understanding how a character's actions affect the other characters in the book. Not this time. This story ends on a sickeningly sweet whitewashing of a heartrendingly stupid mistake. I ended the book hurt and deeply disappointed."
2,Disappointment,"After reading all the wonderful reviews of this book, I couldn't wait to read it. However, I was bored the whole time. I'm happy to see other reviewers who were wondering what the big deal was with this book. This was almost as bad as a Danielle Steel book. Just plain, boring, mundane, but at least Kristin Hannah does not repeat herself over and over....I was looking forward to reading a new author, but this was my first, and probably last, Kristin Hannah book."
4,The Things We Do for Love,"Story line was okay but was disappointed with the ending. End of story was somewhat unrealistic; however, the author did a good job of building the story and then I felt like I was left hanging and expected a better closure."
2,Egh... Not very good,"I wouldn't recommend this book. There wasn't much of a climax to it, just kinda kept going on and on. A bit predictable as well. Of course the teen living with her would get pregnant, it's kind of a given in a book like this. I also felt like it was unrealistic that she was able to save a failing restaurant so easily."
4,Loved 'The Things We do For Love',"I loved It! This was a great story, and very well written! I love how Hannah brings these characters to life--you just can't help but love them all! Her writing reminds me of Jodi Picoult's so if your a Picoult fan give Kristin Hannah a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
1,What a waste of a good summer day!,"My library has a cart out in front where you can pick up and drop off a book without checking it out- that's where I picked this one up and I sure am glad I didn't pay for it. I thought this book was awful. It was formulaic, moralistic, and full of caricatures and stereotypes. Kristin Hannah really missed an opportunity to write a genuine book about the pain and frustration of infertility. I have never read any of her books before this one and will not again."
4,The Things We Do for Love,I found this book to be very enjoyable. It held my interest and kept me questioning the whole time. I do think you will enjoy it also.
3,"Touching story, albeit slightly cliche.","All in all, Hannah told a moving story of two women who filled the gaps in each others' lives. Hannah's writing style initially bored me, and I found myself annoyed with the emphasis on the main character and her issues for much of the beginning. I began to change my mind toward the middle of the book, but the predictable plot turn and cliche overarching message makes this a so-so read."
2,A LOT of old stuff....2002??,"This album has a lot of good music. Problem is most of it has a lot of songs that have been out for more than a year or two. Not very current, then again no US compilation is."
4,It's pretty good,"This cd offers a great variety of dance music that we in the United States don't get too listen to. This cd is a good compilation of hits (mostly from europe) that come directly from the dance floors of night clubs. A good example are:iio-RaptureRoger Sanchez-Another ChanceModjo-Lady Hear Me TonightKosheen-Hide UAlcazar-Crying at the DiscotequeSylver-Turn the Tideand on.....I think that this is a great example of music that we in the states are missing out on. So if you want to listen to some of Europe's top hits, you should pick this up."
5,Changed One Country Boy's Life,"I think it was early summer in 1960. I was eight and facing a long, boring summer, no friends around, nothing to do. Then the Golden Book Encyclopedia appeared in our local Safeway, one new volume a week. My mom would buy the next installment each Friday, and by the following week I'd have read it cover to cover, twice. By summer's end I'd devoured the entire set, and knew a whole lot more about more subjects than most kids my age. I've always felt that those encyclopedias were the most important single event in my education."
4,Great entertainment for fans,This DVD was fun to watch. My husband and I are big Disciple fans and this was funny and entertaining. The seller was also very curteous.
1,Seriously SUCKS,"You may as well throw your money directly down the drain, at least that'd save you some time. When I opened the box upon getting home, i was astonished to find it was simply a fan over a container for water! Despite my initial misgivings, I decided to try the product overnight and to no surprise, it did NOTHING towards humidifying the room. Its a waste of money and electricity."
1,don't waste your $!,"This is the worst product as far as cool mist humidifiers go. I just bought it today. I agree with the previous review...it's just a bucket of H2O with a *wick filter* & just a fan blowing cool air. I, too, thought it was missing a piece or I did something wrong. I just returned a Vicks one as it was too loud & there was no on/off switch, but it worked! I'm going to return this one first thing in the morning. Don't waste your money!"
1,Terrible.,"I just bought this, and I completely agree with the other reviews. this is completely worthless... I would do a better job by just flicking water into the air with my hands. If you are thinking about buying this, either save your money and just drape wet towels around the room to evaporate (it works better than this useless thing) or buy something else. I returned this and bought the crane frog humidifier and it was great, for about $12 more."
2,"It does humidify, but loudly and not a lot","This one works with water evaporation through a sponge inside, and a cheap, noisy fan at the top draws the somewhat moist air up and out. A much better choice is a humidifier that works ultrasonically, which is very quiet and puts out a lot more moisture. The vibrating membrane that creates the mist does get clogged over time with minerals if you have hard water. It can be cleaned to a point, but eventually it might stop misting. Small rooms may get too humid with the ultrasonic types. We have a Holmes HM495 that works very well."
3,high shipping cost and poor product!,"this product is through an outside company...DealYard (not much of a deal if you ask me!) I got this on sale for $16.95 and they charged me $12 for regular shipping. not worth the size or quality of the product.UPDATE - been using this humidifier for less than a week - its awful. It makes loud noises and after 4 days its says the filter needs to be changed! Not worth the sale price, no less regular price!!"
4,"Not as good as ""Jerry"" but a treat for Dog Lovers and London Fans","Less engaging than ""Jerry of the Islands"" but a good read. A must for Irish Terrier owners.Caution, this is London's expose of the brutal training methods used by the trainers for the animal acts of the time. Half the book is descriptions of the typical abuses, some suffered by Michael, some by the animals around him.This was London's last book and he was sick, tired and depressed during this time of his life. It's not among his best but it is powerful stuff, as is all of London's writing."
2,Not what the title says.,"If you think you will actually learn how to fabricate something, you will be disappointed. It is not a HOW-TO book at all. It's nothing more than a listing of monster garage projects describing things they built. Most is a self-aggrandizement description of how great they are and the wild big stuff they built. Some don't even have a picture of the project. A better title is "" Some stuff we built on Monster Garage"". There are no tricks of the trade, nothing new or enlightening, most stuff can't be built by the average tinkerer anyhow because of the enormous tool arsenal required. A total waste. Sorry"
1,Misleading title,I checked this book out from my local library with the hopes of gaining some useful info on metalwork techniques. I was VERY disappointed that there was the smallest smattering of anything useful for learning anything about fabricating. This book is a complete waste of time.
1,go to the library,"too many worthless pictures, large print,no content ,i will never buy a motorbooks book again!!!!!!!!!!!!,and beware of hp books also!!,unless you want worthless glossy pictures!!!!!"
5,Monster Book,Book is amazing. It has full color pictures from the actual Monster Garage show plus other pictures. It goes into the peoples careers who are fabricating the parts. Overall good value for the price.
1,Poor after sales service!!!,"Would not order large electronics outside the US again!!!!! Sipping cost $349. Both speakers arrived malfunctional i.e. would not power up! Amazon offered to replace, however, would have meant paying $349 to ship back to US & same amount to send new speakers out again so simply not practical for such large items! As a result, we spent money locally to replace the transformers of both speakers, with NO assistance from Amazon/the dealer at all!!!Speakers now working & are great but what a hassle!!!!"
4,Sidney Bechet music CD,This is a good recording of Sidney Bechet's work over thirty years of musical recording. My only criticism is that some of the older recordings were not restored as well as I had hoped.
5,Adam-God,"A highly recommended read....for those trying to sort through the confusion of modern Mormonism.The authors views on the doctrine of Mormon deity was a refreshing alternative to the monotony of mainstream Mormonism and mainstream Christianity. I was thoroughly impressed with the apparent attention to historical accuracy.Mr. Tholson's passion for the truth in everyday living for the common Mormon has compelled me to explore further into his works, writings, and inner thoughts. Intimate thoughts and arguments into the historical context of which Adam-God relates to the teachings of Joseph Smith and the revelations which define Mormonism have awakened my blind eyes.I recommend this book to all Mormons and Christians alike searching for a deeper truth..."
1,Poor Quality,"This item BROKE the first time we used it. The electrical contacts are very thin and flimsy and break very easily. All of a sudden, snap, the electrical connection broke and it was done... Many products have this flaw, this isn't the first one that has done this to us. Good power and shape, but since it can and does break very easily, we did not get to use it for very long."
5,Memories,This a good book=Good reading-had it reviewed by an gentleman that actually worked for this railroad and brought smiles to his face and remembers a lot of this book and got his ok that it is accurate. I rode this train when I was a kid YEARS ago. One of the engines is like the Tweetsie in Western NC.
1,"Poor quality snaps, good material","After the initial wash, one diaper lost a snap, after a second wash three more lost their snaps. Seems to be defective snaps or manufacturing.The material is very nice, and everything other than the snaps is well made."
3,"OK book, but somewhat incomplete","I expected more from this book. The author notes (correctly) that the IDE Extensibility model is poorly documented by Microsoft. That's the reason that I bought this book, but it too fails in completely documenting the object model. After reading this book from cover to cover, I got the feeling that this book was thrown together quickly just to get it out. Some of it just seems like filler. For example, there's a chapter on Object Models. Those of us writing add-ins should know this by now. It was all VERY basic stuff. Many of his examples (expecially in the menus section) give examples that go against the MS Word menus. Why? We're writing this stuff for the VB IDE! Unfortunatly, this is about the only book I've found on writing add-ins. Maybe another one will surface soon."
4,"Clear, concise and to the point","Like others, I purchased this book because I was tired of screwing up my face at the pathetic Microsoft documentation.Dr. Roman's explanations and sample code got right to the heart of the matter. Major kudos..."
4,Very clear and well-written,"This book is very clear and well-written. I like Steven Roman's books because they cut through the fog and get down to the essential CONCEPTS. Some of the other reviewers seem to think the book should take them by the hand and do everything in the world for them. I, for one, and tired of bloated 1,000-page plus tomes where you can't see the forest for the trees. What I like about this book is the focus on the ideas."
2,"Decent, but . . .","I was originally going to give this book 3 stars, but after reading the author's retaliatory comments, the best I could offer is a 2 (and I will never buy one of his books again - crybaby).Mr. Roman's earlier book, Learn Word Programming, was excellent. Naturally, this lead me to believe that this book would be just as good. It wasn't.I try to suggest other books in my reviews, but there aren't many that cover this exact topic. You might want to check ""Learn Word 2000 VBA Document Automation"", it has a few projects in there, but they are mainly concerned with Word. Other than that, I guess we will just have to wait for awhile."
5,Great gift for dad/mom/grandparent... (you get the idea),"I bought this book as a holiday gift for my dad (who has always been a bit stymied by his desktop computer) -- he dove right into it & didn't speak to any of us for a couple of hours, so judging by that reaction, I'd have to guess that it was pretty readable for your average intelligent-but-techno-naive senior. Mr. Modem covers a lot of ground (how to get online with an ISP, how to use a search engine, etc.) without going too deeply into any particular topic. Instead, the book gives lots of URLs and places for the neo-surfer to try out his new skills. Hey, maybe Dad will even get the hang of Amazon.com soon ;-)"
3,"Superb Game, Indispensible Reference Book...","Well, now that FunCom has gotten the bugs out of AO and has been developing it (patch 14.2 is going live today), I take back everything bad I ever said about it. Anarchy Online is superb and has at last begun living up to the hype and the high expectations I had of it from the beginning.As for this book, it was pretty out of date when it was published and it has in no way kept up with the massive changes and additions to the game itself. However, despite that and that it is generally a little weak overall, the book is absolutely indispensible as a reference guide to everything from maps, to nanos, to clusters, to weapons and monsters. Yes, even much of that data is out-of-date now, but there is still rarely a session where I don't refer to the book at least once. If they published the book again with more current information, I'd definitely buy it."
3,Well worth the money....,"I'll keep this short and sweet. This book is not much more than an extended version of the game manual. However, that may not be a bad thing depending on how you look at it. Personally, I think the extra information and zone maps are worth the money."
3,Strategies and Secrets???,"This book works as a great reference book, bottom line. There is only the very basis of any kind of stratgy in this book and if there are any secrets, then finding them is the biggest one and is clearly ommited from this publication. More information on strategy (and yes even secrets) can be gleaned from the MANY online fansites. This being said, I will restate that the book does contain many great charts and works well as a reference book only."
2,Lacking high level details,"This guide is missing some essential details that are needed for higher level characters. It only has maps of about 3 cities (it doesn't have maps for Rome, one of the largest, most populated city in the game) and it doesn't have maps of the higher level zones either.The list of nano programs that this guide has does not include details about the higher level programs.Overall, this guide would be strictly for a newbie, if you are passed level 20, this guide would be a waste of [money]"
1,Did McCubbin actually play the game???,"Actually, that is beside the point. The launch of AO was horrid (second only to ww2online), and the Devs have been ""balancing/nerfing/tweaking"" so many things that the mechanics are almost unrecognizable at this point. For example, the Nanotech class description described them as ""the master of Nanos"" and ""able to Solo, Group, and PvP effectively.""People who actually play this class (which turns out to be a complete gimp after level 40 of 200), have taken to fascetiously quoting the ""official guide"" in their signatures when posting on the funcom forums complaining about broken game mechanics.The entire game is a joke and after building a character up to the middle-game I cancelled my subscription before they could bill my credit card. If you want accurate info about how bad it is (Funcom has started censoring their official forums before the European launch because of ""too much negativity"".)...."
2,Very bad picture quality!,"The Bonus Features on this edition has a bad picture quality.They use copys of the third generation!! That's not a good job!Of course the movies are great, but the original film is in MONOand the BONUS is a joke for the year of 2007! Greetings from Germany"
2,GOT TO AGREE WITH THE OTHERS,"The 'Special Edition' is fantastic. But, it is the same as the 2001 edition......The 'Theatrical Version' sounded better on VHS & TV etc... THEY BLEW IT!!!! The sound is low...no Bass....awful!!I bought this to get the 'Theatrical Version' with GREAT sound. There are moments on that version not on the 'Special Edition; like when Elvis tries to find a working microphone....the ""2 out of 4 aint bad"" part.I cant believe in 2007 they can do no better than this. It almost a 2nd generation ripoff of the VHS.PS- This is not Elvis' fault....he gives great performances....ruined by the thumblefisted production crew.They filmed 6 shows in 3 different outfits. Give ME the MASTER tapes and I would produce a 4 hour extravaganza for all Elvis fans.Horrible job."
3,Mixed review,"If you have never seen this footage or the original, I rate it a 5. If you are looking for the original, which has some unforgetable songs and footage, or have seen the 'special edition', this is a 1. If you've never seen Elvis in concert at his peak #1969-1973#, this is a must see. I seriously doubt we will ever see another performer like Elvis Presley and ""That's the way it is""."
5,A Great Elvis DVD,"For anyone who never saw elvis in person, you will really enjoy watching this 2 cd set. I enjoyed the first cd better than the 2nd because it concentrated more on elvis and the concert whereas the 2nd cd had a lot of interviews with fans."
5,ELVIS - That's The Way It Is,"First time I saw this was at the Governor Ritchie Drive-in theater in Glen Burnie, Maryland, late one August night, and have been fascinated with it ever since. You will be blown away by the intensity, energy & moves this guy has. This is the best concert footage available on Elvis. The other documentary filmed two years later, ELVIS ON TOUR (1972)runs a very close 2nd. This video shows Elvis looking, singing, & moving at his best. For many, it is a revalation that Elvis was so trim in 1970 or 72. When you think of Elvis in the 70's, you think of a heavy set performer, but it was only the last couple years of the 70's that he actually became overweight. I will go out on a limb & say this video will convert anyone who is not an elvis fan."
3,what happened to the .1 ?,I think this was a great reproduction of the original movie.The movies main goal was to eliminate all the footage that people did'nt want to see anyways.The problem I have is my subwoofer turns to the stand by mode when playing this dvd meaning there is no information being sent to it.This movie is supposed to be in 5.1
4,Elvis in Top Form,"Elvis is in top form here, but not as spectactular as in the 68 Comeback Special. The extra clips with the fan's comments are embarrassing. I don't know why they ever made it into the film. The sound is subpar for a DVD."
3,"Great Songs, Horrible Audio","The dvd engineers could have put much more effort into this. Visually, it's not bad, but, not great either. To attempt to really hear this, you have to put the volume at such a high level it's distorted. The hiss can't be removed even when you turn the treble and front mid levels way down. Don't try to blast this, you'll only damage your speakers . I bought it because it's Elvis. For the non-diehard fan, I say hold off buying this and send complaints to MGM with the rest of us. We deserve a remastered version asap. Even for 70's audio equipment, this is pretty bad. An easy five star dvd if the audio was better."
2,Look for the original version instead,"The remastering is excellent, but I prefer the original film. Some of my favorite performances are missing (like BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER) as well as ALL the interviews. And how do you access all the extra songs that are supposedly included? I can't find them anywhere! Try to find the original version before it disappears!"
5,A Toast too Elvis,I recently purchased this on Dvd&just truly enjoyed all the elements in it.I've dug Elvis Presley for a really long time&I wanted a Dvd too Capture what made Him One of the Greatest Artists Ever.His Voice was still Solid&in peak form here.
2,Missed most of the song of the albums,"I saw the movie, then I bought the 8-track, the LP, later the CD and now the DVD just to found that missed 8 of the 12 the sound track songs,I'm very dissapointed"
5,An Elvis freak,The King still lives 0n the movies and music he sang and I seen this movie on tv to me it is a great movie.If you are an Elvis fan like me you should buy this movie.
4,A must for every Elvis fan,Every Elvis fan will want this DVD set in their collection. Behind the scenes and great concert coverage will be your reward.
4,I just can't believe it!,"Yes, yes, all the reviews here still apply, and Elvis is Elvis but I think everyone should know, BEFORE buying this DVD, that the song ""I just can't help believing"" is not on this DVD! I saw the movie when I was a kid and that song really stuck in my head. Thirty years later, I'm still humming it! I blindly bought this DVD and 'I just can't believe' that this song is not there?! To make things worse, it plays tantalizingly on the menu! (My younger son said, Appa why don't you just listen to the menu!) This is the kind of marketing BS that makes me ill. It is common practice to leave out at least one great song on a ""best of..."" or a ""...greatest hits"" to force you to buy another CD for that one song you love, but this is too much. A ""Special Edition"" DVD without the best rendition I've ever heard, of a great song. I bought this DVD for one song and it isn't there!"
3,What Was Warner/MGM Thinking?!?!?,"First of all, the reason I bought this set was to have both versions (1970 & 2001) on DVD and while I love both versions (except for the deleted songs from the special edition), my real gripe is the bonus footage and the sound on the 1970 version of TTWII---it's in MONO!! WHY?!?The sound on the bonus footage is HORRIBLE and the ""bonus"" footage sucks because it looks to be a third or fourth generation copy....an amateur could have done better editing and mixing these DVDs!!Either way, they'll both still get lots of playing time in my DVD player...although I'll skip the ""extras""."
1,Original theatrical version has horrific sound and bad picture.,"I was very disappointed when I got this dvd set. The Special edition is excellent both sound and picturewise.The Theatrical version is just horrible. The sound recording level is extremely low (you'll need either very sensitive speakers or a very powerful amplifier to get normal volume). Also, bass is practically nonexistent, and it's mono too. This sounds worse than old VHS versions. Picture quality is also inferior to the Special edition. All in all, the widescreen laserdisc sadly remains the best way to view the Theatrical version.The outtakes are interesting, but they are too plagued by the very low recording level. The sound on them is much worse than on official or bootleg cd's. Picture quality varies, and is generally poor."
5,The King at His Finest,This is a really enjoyable DVD. The King looks and sounds fabulous. I love the shirts Elvis wears in his rehearsals. He is and always will be the true King of all entertainment. Elvis had a gift from God that has never been duplicated. You can still feel the magnetism and closeness Elvis had with his audiences in these videos. It's amazing that even 40 years later that connection is still evident with the viewing audiences of today. Truly remarkable!
3,Get with it MGM!,"Why this video/DVD's audio has not been re-mastered using theoriginal stereo concert recordings is beyond me. Why they decided tomake ""The Lost Performances"" in stereo but not these performances is a shame because it really takes away from the viewing/listening experience."
3,"The way it is, is OK Only","Improvisation and behind-the-scenes, the movie rates an 'A,' however for concert performance check out Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii, although I've only ever seen it available on tape or VCD."
3,A blast of Elvis!,"Hey, whatever happend to ""I just Can't Help Believin'? This song is cut out from the concert footage. What a drawback...!The scenes before the concert at a recording session with the guys makes up for the cut out or lost scenes. ""I just can't help believin'""Elvis, a gift from heaven and wonderful to explore his singing ability.Elvis rocks away his inhibitions if indeed he has them.Follow the course, watch this movie and learn.Elvis marks your inhibitions and rejects them, they're not yours anymore.""Elvis is not dead, he's dad"""
5,Elvis Thats The Way It Is (Special Edition),"Elvis Thats The Way It Is in this Special Edition of the legendary Las Vegas concert shot in 1970. This movie goes in the studio with Elvis and back-stage. I have seen all the live Elvis movies and nothing can compare to this one. This DVD is Restored, remixed, it focuses on a new look at Elvis Presley. The sound is out of this world its way better than the orginal the cameras keep rolling their is not a missed piece of footage. This is a must have for an Elvis Presley fan I enjoyed this and so will you so what are you waiting for go buy this!!!!!"
3,"That's the Way It Is, not the way it could have been","First disc is a straight copy of the 2000 Special Edition. Second disc is a staright copy of the 1970 original...in MONO, and no picture restoration. It pales next to the 2000 version. The bonus features are what we were promised in 2000, minus the Beatles' covers...and two or three songs in this BONUS section are in the original film...to add insult to injury, the quality of these BONUS features suffers terribly. Elvis fans have long been used to the ""repackage ripoff"" releases the movie & record companies have given us...add this to the list."
2,Be forewarned,"Fans were justly horrified with some of the editing decisions made in the ""new"" version of the film (especially the ommission of 'I Just Can't Help Believing'). Now the original has finally been released on DVD in the correct aspect ratio but with a MONO soundtrack [it was originally 4 track stereo]."
3,"great performance, low quality sound","This disc looks awesome and the performances here are exceptional, but the sound quality is terrible why would they not put this in 5.1 dolby digital? the cd sounds great and these are wonderful songs but iam very disapointed with the sound."
4,"Great footage, good quality video","This is a great video for any Elvis fan. Lots of neat ""in studio"" rehearsal stuff giving an inside view of the King working behind the scenes. Really good concert footage as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the video."
3,What could have been,"The concept is brilliant - rework the ""hatchet"" job that Dennis Sanders did on the original movie, cut out all the annoying interviews and fan club meetings and just show Elvis doing what he did best - knocking them dead on stage and in rehearsals. The extra footage, CD quality sound and different camera angles are all done brilliantly (although the sound is a little patchy in places). The reworking of ""Patch it up"" is worth the money on it's own - it is sensational. Which leaves me with only one very serious criticism,can anyone please tell me why so many of the original songs were cut out? Where is "" I just can't help believing"" ( arguably his finest live song), ""Bridge over troubled water"" to name a few? Ultimately these ommissions spoil what should have been the rightful ressurrection of a flawed original. What were they thinking?"
4,Elvis magic,"If you like Elvis or are otherwise into charasmatic performers, you will love this movie. It has enough behind the scences footage to give it intimacy than one gets from watching a simple on stage performance."
5,Elvis That's The Way It Is DVD,"This Music dvd of the king is fantastic. In the beginning there are some studio takes, and the group from elvis with james burton, john wilkinson, ronny tutt and others are practice for the concert he give in 1970 known as that's the way it is. The concert is flawless, Elvis sings so very good here you should almost forget that it is live recorded. One thing you can say about elvis if you hear this dvd. He was really THE KING"
2,Not worth it!,"Save your hard earned dollars. I purchased this DVD and This Is Elvis special edition as well. It is a repackaging of the same old stuff. The best part of TIE is the car scene where Elvis says, ""I was buried in a ?#%(#$"". Followed by lots of laughter. It may as well have been bleeped out. When this movie was on TV in Canada years ago, the sound was great and one could hear everything. Everything! I was hoping the live Little Sister would include Get Back, but no, we are sadly disappointed. Again! Maybe someone in the know could tell us just exactly what outtakes are being held 'in the can' and why. Is Elvi$ still the meaning of Elvis? Elvis On Tour in our future? I think, again sadly, no."
1,I want my money back from Time Warner,"I just can't help believing! (Actually, this is one of the songs that is not included on this DVD. Can you believe it?) I have no idea how to access to those ""Bonus Selections"" that are listed. I think there must be something wrong with the production line. Read the other reviews, they are all true: all the great songs you like from the original version are gone! To all disappointed fans, send a complaint to Turner Entertainment/Time Warner Home Video and ask them to get things right and replace the ones we have bought."
5,The King In All His Glory,This is the best concert footage of Elvis on the market that Ican find. He absolutely mesmorizes the audience on the film ANDthe audience at home. It leaves you wishing that the producerscould make a Part 2 assembling other songs that were performedand not put on this one. This production is a must for any Elvis fan and anyone even remotely curious about him. Watch this and you will understand all what Elvis was about. It willmake you a fan if you weren't already one.
4,DVD Elvis Thats The Way It Is,"I was very impressed by the quality of the recordings and the picture was so crystal clear that it was like he had been flimed yesturday....it has a great song list....BUT....I actually sent it back because the bonus 15 tracks that where supposed to be extra footage where actually not included..and allot of the song that where in the supposed bonus footage are teh songs that I like most....it was a real shame that they missed out the bonus footage as it would of made an excellent addition to your collection...also one thing that really annoyed me was that It came in one of those cheap card board covers, instead of the standard plastic sleve covers, which is really annoying as it easly gets wrecked and torn...in conclusion I would probably wait till they re-release it with the bonus footage!!"
4,Elvis: That's The Way It Is,"I am a fan of Elvis' 1970 classic white jumpsuit period and was delighted to see the 30th anniversary video with new footage. When I learned of its release in early 2001, I was hoping there would be more footage of Elvis' September 1970 Phoenix Coliseum show (the brief bit that opened the original movie and seemed to be the most excitement of an alread exciting movie), but was dissapointed that the entire credit sequence was redone. Not to worry, the new scenes at Culver City (July '70) and at the International Hotel (August '70) are fascinating. Basically the entire movie has been redone on new angles of filming. All the interviews with the fans are gone so the action onstage is left uninterrupted. But as with the original movie, I wish the Phoenix footage received more attention. Oh well."
2,ELVIS AT HIS BEST IN A DEEPLY FLAWED MOVIE,"What a tragedy: In these Las Vegas performances, Elvis looks and sounds better than ever -- but the experience is marred by almost shockingly incompetent filmmaking. It would be acceptable if the only flaw was that performances look as though they were shot in Super-8. But what really ruins this movie is that for some unknowable reason the filmmaker inter-spliced positively banal and truly boring interviews throughout, with the most peculiar Elvis fans a person could find. An example: We're treated to watching to English fans ride around on a bicycle that Elvis donated to their fan club. The interview segments have the inadvertent effect of making Elvis fans look absurd and making the rest of us wonder what could be wrong with a star who has such pallid followers. It's just too bad that these otherwise wonderful performances are marred by such bad judgement and lack of direction on the part of the filmmaker."
1,Dreadful picture and sound quality--needs remastering!,"Elvis fans waited a long time to get this on DVD. The great original VHS extended version is subjugated to secondary status here: no widescreen, no stereo, no picture or sound remastering at all. The original theatrical version, on the other disc is only slightly better in sound but the picture is also dreadful and not even up to the original VHS standard. Elvis fans deserve a lot better!"
2,Amazing Grace Mahalia Jackson,"This is the third cd from the recent purchase, and again disappointing. I really think our problem is that we were expecting something of the richness of her recording of ""The Power and the Glory"", and these are all very different, so maybe we are being too harsh in our judgement of these 3, ""Gospels, spiritals and songs"" and ""The Best of Mahalia Jackson"", the last being the better of the three. I don't see these getting much playing and would be glad to sell them at a discount to anyone in Oz, if interested."
5,Moving hymns by the greatest of all gospel singers!,"Some of the reviewers here reject this album because it's not 'toe-tappin' gospel music, but (pardon me for saying so), they are confused a bit about the genre. This is an album of hymns, not 'spirituals' or what we have come to think of as gospel songs. Comparing 'I Believe,' the most moving of all hymns, IMO, with 'Walk in Jerusalem' is like comparing a gentle road trip through Italy with racing in the Indy 500. Hymns are supposed to be moving, not toe-tapping. Songs like 'I Believe,' one song alone that makes this CD worth owning, are meant to be deep statments of faith. It moves me every time, and I'm an agnostic, and plan to remain so. Don't get me wrong. I love up-tempo songs like 'I'm on my Way.' I just wouldn't compare it with 'Amazing Grace.'If you love the sonorous, emotionally-charged sound of Mahalia's voice at its best, check out this CD!"
5,Great!,"My thoughts are the total opposite of the previous reviewer. This CD is not a waste of money. In fact, it's a CD that should be added to your music collection. This is one of the Mahalia albums that isn't ""traditional"" Gospel. The previous reviewer said that the background accompaniment was dominant, but that's untrue. Most of the music is soft and mellow-like. ""Amazing Grace"" shows the power of Mahalia's voice. ""The Bible Tells Me So,"" ""I Complained,"" and ""For My Good Fortune"" show that Mahalia had a very versatile voice.I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS, THIS CD IS WORTH HAVING!!!!!"
1,Not worth it.,"Cheesey production quality, terrible script, hokey acting. Disney this ain't. Unless your kids are mindless video drones, save your money and leave this gobbler on the shelf."
2,"Come back, Martin Amis!","I wait for Amis' books like I would the Second Coming, and I'm usually not left wanting. Unfortunately this was not my experience with YELLOW DOG. I felt at times he was trying to emulate Burroughs' cut-and-paste technique with the plot, but I didn't empathize enough with the characters to want to go back and retrace my steps. Yes, there's some diamond-sharp prose in this book, but it doesn't hang together. Where's the brilliance of LONDON FIELDS? The belly laughs of THE INFORMATION? Sorry, Martin, but you lost me on this one."
2,Pretentious and Too self-involved.,"I am not quite sure if there is a plot in this novel. It is a preachy novel about pornography and journalism. Xan Meo is more like an idealogy than a three-dimensional character. There is a sense of superficial intelligensia. The novel meanders with Xan Meo's [complaining] practically about everything. Smoker the journalism is a much more interesting character, but then again, Amis has to inject his snobberish intellectulism -- philosophizing everything.What is this novel about? A waste of my [money]."
2,"Finish it, then forget it","This is a disappointing work when compared to Money and London Fields and even Amis's shorter works such as Night Train and Other People. The book is all over the place really, but tangled up in the mess are dazzling threads of Amis's sublime wordsmithery. The behaviour of the characters strains credibility to breaking point and by the time you get near the end, you just want them all to f*** off. But maybe that's the point..."
5,Dissection of our need for violence and pornography,"As usual in an Amis novel the wordplay is sparkling. Yellow Dog examines in a bizarrely comic plot the way violence and pornography permeate our ""sophisticated"" culture, how these primitive phenomena percolate through our high-tech, media-saturated world. The horrible reviews this book has received are inexplicable except perhaps by jealousy or an exaggerated response to regression to the (very exalted) mean."
3,Good and promising,"Hellacopters play a rather uncomplicated style of rock a la the 1970's. The band's two latest releases ""High visibility"" and ""By the grace of God"" are very good to say the least. In their home land, Sweden, these two albums have established Hellacopters as solid rock act of highest quality. ""Grande rock"" from 1999 is without doubt not equally praised since the songs seem to not catch the attention of the listener the same way, although the tracks are in a way rather similar to the tunes on followed albums. On ""Grande rock"" you can hear references to early Kiss as well as to Blackfoot, and it's all spiced up with a raw approach. Sometimes, like in ""Dog day mornings"" there's almost a punk rock feeling. This album indicates what to come later down the Hellacopter road, and even `tho it's not outstanding you'll probably enjoy songs like ""The devil stole the beat from the lord"", ""Welcome to hell"" and ""Lonely"" - at least if you're a fan of vintage hard rock."
2,Not as good as previous albums.,"The Hellacopters have cleaned up their sound. Gone is the is the processing on the vocals, and the distortion on the guitars is much lower. As a result, the sound is less harder and less interesting.Commercial sellout? Buy their other albums and forget about this one unless you are a diehard fan."
1,Nice pictures rotten cd,This CD needs some work. She has a wonderful voice but this isn't her usual self. The pictures are nice but not worth the price of the CD. I heard so much good about the taping couldn't wait to get the CD and now I wish I had NOT BOUGHT IT.Still love Lorrie and her older Cd's this just didn't cut it. Oh well file it away with that duet one with Sammy.
5,Stephanie Laurens Delivers Again,"This is a series that doesn't necessarily have to be read in order & each one is so different! If you read the Bastion Club you HAVE to read the Cynster novels...excellent!,"
3,Interesting at first but too predictable at the end,"The story started off interesting with Kit masquerading as a leader of a gang of smugglers and her escapades challenging Captain Jack and gang. However, the story sort of went flat after Kit succumbing to Jack's charm. She loses her adventurous spirit. It was not surprising that after the marriage, she was like another person. Everything became too predictable at the end and I almost could not finish reading the book. Erotic and passionate - Yes, but not exciting enough to maintain the thrill throughout."
2,weak effort,"The book starts well, with a strong female character but when kit meets our hero she becomes irrational,irritating and weak time and time again. All it takes is a kiss and kit is unable to have a discussion about things that matter to her. Really, how sad is that she is so easily manipulated. I enjoy sex scenes but I'll confess that I skipped a lot of them out of irritation."
3,entertaining,"very entertaining book but got a little too ridiculous at times! i kept rolling my eyes because kit was always, always wearing men's clothing even when she didn't have to!and amazingly enough, this book has too much sex. i love a sensual, passionate romance novel probably more than most, but too much is too much and takes the steam out of things.jack was also a bit unlikeable at times."
2,"Get some spine, woman!","Normally I love Stephanie Laurens' writing, but this book left me wanting to slap the heroine about once every twenty pages. It started off well - an independent, smart woman, and a smart but arrogant lord. She'll change him, right?Wrong. For the ENTIRETY of the book, she gets mad at him, plans to tell him how she feels, and somehow can't keep a coherent thought whenever he's around. So they have drawn out sex - and then the scene changes. Why doesn't she ask him after they get the physical stuff out of their system? Argh! He stays arrogant the whole time, and she accepts ""he's arrogant but I love him anyway"" instead of ""I finally got him to admit I'm a valid person too.""All in all, I'll probably keep this book around because it's by Stephanie Laurens and I have the rest of hers, but it's not going to my ""read this again"" pile. Her Cynster books are much better."
3,"good writing...BUT the characters hardly ever 'TALKED""","The writing talent is very good but... the characters hardly ever talked!!All of you 4-5 starers.Think about it. We ALWAYS read the characters ""thoughts' but there was hardly and verbal interaction.Did any of you notice that. It was very frustrating because the writing is very good .I skimmed a lot of pages. Being a ""reader of many books. I don't want to skimm."
3,A disappoinment...,"I loved the idea of this book, and it had all the potential to be great, but it just sort of fizzled and died. I thought that it was pretty sexist too, Captain Jack was too shovanist for me and the heroine played right in to that. YUCK. But despite the absence of two characters who were equals and him really respecting her, it was a fun read, just not as great as it could have been if the hero and heroine had been better developed characters."
2,Not good enough,"This book is a disappointment in many ways. It begins rather well, but the characters are not allowed to evolve, and the plot - which could have been excellent - fails miserably mainly because ms. Laurens time and again has her main characters jumping into bed instead of working out their problems. Don't get me wrong - I enjoy reading those scenes as much as the next person - but in this book they really get in the way. Frankly it feels as if the author tries to put as much erotic action into the story in order to avoid expanding the plot. Jack's personality also irritated me to the point of dislike. Obviously(!) he enjoys going to bed with Kit. But to do it constantly to avoid talking with and listening to his own wife? Sorry - ""that don't impress me much!"" In addition there is a certain feel of anachronism to the whole thing, which is very dissapointing considering ms. Laurens' other work."
1,horrible service,I returned the original belt because the size shipped was too small. I have still not received the replacement in size 40 that I orginally ordered. No vendor response would suggest no one use this vendor until they clean up their act.
4,"A great tester, but...","I am a service manager for a local trailer dealership. These testers need to be made more (internally) sturdy This is a great tester, the big drawback is it is fragile, don't drop it! it breaks easily. Two other shops I have worked in had these testers for a while...until someone dropped it! Don't loan it to anyone."
2,Bad book for novice,"""Apache The Definitive Guide"" has lots of good informations. However, this book is poorly explained and organized. Inorder to understand the author motives, you have read each line carefully. If you have never installed apache before, this book won't help you get it install. However, if you have some experience in Apache, this book can give you a better insight about Apache Server."
1,Probably a semi-decent reference but poorly organized.,Our company purchased this book for our in-house library mainly because of the O'Reilly name. Unfortunatly the name doesn't hold true in this book. 2 chapters in I find it to be poorly organized with information that is otherwise useful but in this book so out of place as to be confusing. Even for someone who is relatively familliar with Apache. I'm going to buy the Apache Bible and hope that it is put together with more forethought.
3,Useful but poorly organized,"I bought this in a local store while waiting for my copy of the Apache Bible. I found that the book contained enough useful information to get me going with Apache, but it is patchy and poorly organized. Also, as someone else pointed out, the description of how to build an SSL-capable Apache does not work, at least not on Solaris 7. If you want to build SSL into Apache, use mod_ssl (follow the links from apache.org), not Laurie's apache_ssl."
2,Poorly written and ill-organised,This could have been a very good book but the author seems to suffer from an inability to identify with an audience that doesn't already know the material.The material is all there and if you struggle through it you can find alot of useful insights...but more times than not the struggle isn't worth it. I can't suggest getting it unless you feel compelled to collect books on Apache or are in desperate need of more documentation.
2,Online docs will do...,"I bought this book, but it turned out that I didn't really have to use much of it. The source program package from apache comes with a complete, up-to-date installation guide, online docs, pointers to FAQ and other info. If you are trying to set up Apache in the absense of any internet access (some kind of a boot-strapping process that someone might have to do in some special settings), this book might be useful. But that's usually not the case, and I wonder who would bother? For quick reference purposes, O'Reilley's Webmaster in a Nutshell would do a much better job for dollar."
2,Save your Money...read online documentation,"This book is nothing more than the existing online documentation with a little extra information. I did not find it any more informative than the documentation at the Apache web site. Extremely disapointing. What makes this the ""definitive guide""?More examples of how to configure the various parameters and directives would have been more helpful than just repeating information already in the Apache documentation.Discussion of VirtualHosts is very limited."
3,Well ....... I think it may be better than,"I grabbed this book and started the brain sucking upall the information I could. Whoops! Where is it? This book doesdiscuss a lot about Apache, but it sure falls short of ""definitive guide"".I have had to search the web to find out really useful information.<PIt did get me to thinking about what I wanted to do with my server.But, if you are looking for a book to get you started and up and running as an ISP --- FORGET this book. It just does not have the information needed.Sorry O'Reilly, I like most of your books, but this one does not make the grade"
1,Right Topics - erroneous info,"I gauge a book based on it's ability to answer my questions. So when I wanted to learn basic virtual host configuration on a Redhat Linux 6.1/Apache 1.3.9 system I was encouraged by the apparently in-depth treatment given to the subject. There were numerous examples given. Too bad the one for name based virtual hosts was apparently wrong, at least for my version of unix and apache. As I have only been through the first 70 or so pages of the book, perhaps it is too early to fairly pass judgement, but on the ONE question I primarly bought the book for help on, it failed me."
3,Useful for Apache beginners,"As O'Reilly books go, Apache: The Definitive Guide is really rather weak. There's enough information to get an Apache installation up and running, but there's nowhere near enough depth for it to be called a 'definitive' guide. It's also a little out of date.A far better book is Wrox's 'Professional Apache' which covers everything the O'Reilly book does and much more."
3,Something of a Lemon,"An unwelcome reminder that not everything that comes from O'Reilly is top notch.This book seems to have been written half heartedly. The explanations of many of the directives in the configuration file seem to be repetitions of online manual contents with the authors not taking the time to provide really useful insights or clarify difficult concepts.The attitude of the book seems to be: ""This is what we did to get Apache running on BSD and Windows. If it helps you, great, if not, tough !""I also have a doubt about the technical credibility of the authors. Their advice seems glib and dubious at times.I have run Apache on Windows before without consulting documentation and I expected to learn something useful from this book. Not in the 1st three chapters.Not a great tutorial. Not a very good reference manual.One of the few books I would lend to someone and probably not worry about it being returned."
3,A good introduction to Apache,"This book is clearly written in understandable english. It serves as a good introduction to the Apache Server, however lacks the depth is necessary when managing a high demand webserver. Features such as SSL and integration with X500 were not covered."
2,Only good for very casual newbies,"Other reviewers are right, this book doesn't deserve the O'Reilly reputation. This book organizes information loosely, and if you are clueless about Apache, reading this book wouldn't really benefit. Though, if you treat this book as a story book, maybe you can still read it, but don't expect much.If you want to spend your time better on the Apache subject, try the ""Professional Apache"" by Peter Wainwright by Wrox, which is a really ""definitive"" guide. (With that book I finished my domain name and virtual hosting within a few hours, marvelous by my standard.)"
2,Where's the Big Picture,"The authors jump in with an example configuration, but never explain how each element of the configuration relates to the rest. For example- do alias statements take precedence over <directory> blocks ? Does it matter what order an alias or scriptalias directive appears in your file ? We are never told. In addition, there is a lack of continuity between one experiment in configuration and the next. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's unclear who the intended audience is. I'm sure at some point I'll get some value from the API documentation, but as a newbie to Apache, I've learned considerably more through trial and error on my own than by reading this book."
2,Outdated and Poorly Targeted,"This book is targeted at the wrong people. It's written at a level of detail that falls somewhere between what you'd need if you already know how to work with Apache and that you'd need if you've never worked with it before. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to provide the information that's really most-needed for either end of the spectrum. There's little more than hand-waving over how and where to set up webs on a server or how to deal with configuration differences in Unix flavors. And the organization appears to be a weird hybrid between the ""read all and understand"" and the ""do as you read"" models for software books. My advice: Look for another book, or look this one over very carefully to make sure it's suitable for your level of experience and learning style."
4,"Definitely a reference book, but good for that..","This book will not teach you how to set up Apache if you've never done it before, but is a handy guide for Security, LogFormat configuration etc. Although it could be more readable, if you ever touch a .conf file you should have this on your desk."
4,"Good reference, ok for casual users","Overall, this book is an extremely good reference for the syntax and commands of the Apache web server config file. I really learned a lot in not only the Linux (*nix also) platform, but more importantly the Windows platform since I started out on a Windows machine before I started using Linux. I might hold off on getting this book until Apache 2.0 final is released. I was a little disappointed that the book did not give better coverage to Apache mods since it just waved it's hand over them without much explaination or throughness. Overall, good book, but keep in mind it is mainly for reference and you will ned to know a little bit about it before you start."
1,Apache-The definitve guide,"I've bought 'running Linux' from O'reilly before and its indeed a good book for linux novice and I bought 'Apache- The definitive guide'in turn. However, I was so disappointed about this book as some materials covered there were outdated! I kindly suggest you (especailly the novice for apache) to take serious consideration before attempting to buy this book! I've bought 'Professional Apache', it's a totally differnt story compared to this book!"
2,Less than expected,"I have to agree with many of the reviews. This book is not up to par with other O'Reilly editions. It is a good reference, though not worth the price considering the on-line docs are free. Also, there is something about the tone of the book and the writing style that seemed inappropriate for a technical book. Attempting to be funny in a private sort of way, poking fun at sales types and company motives. It gets old pretty quick.The book repeatedly stresses that Win32 is not a serious platform for securing web sites. This is true, but many of us have no choice. The authors refuse to cover Win32 security, and make repeated claims that Win32 is poorly documented and understood. Well...isn't that what books are for?Don't bother with the book if you're on Win32."
4,Good introduction and reference to Apache,"This book serves as a good introduction to the Apache server, detailing in the first chapter what Apache is and how it works with UNIX/Linux, etc. Further chapters explain setting up Apache, working with such topics as CGI, Authentication, Redirection, Proxy Servers, Server-Side Includes, Security and Writing Apache Modules.Most chapters also have specific reference information for each topic included. The tutorial approach makes it easier for sys admins and programmers to learn how to install and maintain an Apache server. The examples of the butterhlies company make the concepts a little easier to follow. I acquired this book to familiarize myself with Apache and after reading this book I have a better understanding of it. The book is geared more towards Unix/Linux than Windows however.This book is a nice training and reference source."
2,"Very basic, generalized. Not much there.","If you've used Apache without even reading about any detailed configurations, you'd still not see anything new in this book. I can see this book being a little useful for beginners, but even then, it's not really getting into very detailed information about the configurations and whatnot for module installs/additions. I can see someone new still getting frustrated with this book if they run into a problem.I picked it up, well, because I buy every O'Reilly book that comes out (seriously) and thought I might be able to find something interesting, useful or that I wasn't aware of or forgot... maybe even a little tip about efficiency, compiling options or just anything of interest.This is no more useful than the README and INSTALL files that come with Apache's source code. I'm not sure I want to even give this two stars come to think of it. I just don't see the point to this book. A let down coming from O'Reilly."
2,I need something better,"I did not like this book. I think you can do much better with another Apache book. The authors basically wrote a diary of setting up a webserver from start to finish. They seem board out of their mind and try to be funny ever once and a while. They copy the man pages word for word occasionally.I need something serious and authoritive where the authors are passionate about the subject like the authors in ""Unix Power Tools"" or ""Unix System Administration Handbook""Come on O'Reilly, give us a better book on Apache and show us how to install PHP."
2,Handle with Care!,"This can be an aggravating book. On the plus side, Kohler includes pictures of a great many extant garments, which are invaluable as a resource (the book's value as a source rises considerably after 1500 for this reason). On the other hand, there are many ""patterns""--especially in the medieval period--which, unless you read carefully, can be interpreted as being taken from extant garments, and the introduction claims almost outright that these diagrams are ""correct."" They are not, being instead Kohler's own hypotheses. Many of them do not work as patterns. I have known many a beginner who took these diagrams as gospel and have ended up with nothing resembling an actual medieval garment. Use the illustrations (but not the ""patterns"") and the book can have some degree of usefulness."
3,A good overview...,"This book gets a lot of use in my collection. My aim is creating authentically reproduced garments. This book contains rudimentary layouts for garments, with measurements. It also has a satisfactory brief overview of written material. Not only for the various periods, but also for different regions during a particular period. This book would be a good quick reference for a re-enactor trying to start character developement."
5,Awesome Purchase!,"I love this product! While the series is definitely not best for beginning yogis, the short 30 minute sessions make it easy to fit yoga practice into my daily life. The episodes provide variety for an at-home yogi for much less money than attending a studio."
1,They sent just the handbook....,"I received FINAL CUT STUDIO seven weeks ago, but there were only the handbooks in the box. Since then I'm waiting and mailing and phoning, and they always say, it's coming. I think I will never receive the software. Apple refuses to pay back the money. I don't know what to do?! TWO MONTHS later after several inquiries they offered a new shipment.But still (March 21, 2006) no 720/25p, so no JVC HD101 in the PAL region on a mac."
2,Scorned was alot better,"Even the unrated version of this movie was a disapoinment.All of the ""special"" scenes were either slow,or broken up with parts of other stuff happening in the movie.If you really want to see Tweed at her sexiest,see ""Scorned""!"
3,No widescreen?,"I NEVER buy fullscreen movies. I didnt even know they still made them.Unfortunately, this film was transferred with no extras, commentaries or deleted scenes."
2,Like a cold shower,A fairly decent story.If you were expecting to see a lot of nude Tweed you will however be disapointed.The sex scenes are very contrived and as sexy as dried cow dung.Ms Tweed is still a great looker but the bod is going!!!!
5,A must have for teens and adults,"Working in a religious education office, we review many books. This one definitely stood out as an exception. It's a user friendly set-up and references the Bible and the CCC. There is a lot of information under this cover. This handbook is not just for teens, but also for adults. I've given them as gifts and they are well received from those distanced from their faith and those close to it. St. Mary's Press is an excellent publisher."
3,"Better than nothing, I suppose","This book is a brave attempt at giving teenagers a comprehensive view of the Catholic faith, and it's not bad, but has some implied liberal social viewpoints that are really quite annoying and get in the way of instruction. Bad-mouthing corporations and ""gas guzzlers"" while promoting gun control is very simplistic, and misses the point.Still, it's a least a starting point, and is more readable and probably connects to a youth audience far better than an old copy of The Baltimore Catechism or My Catholic Faith."
5,Beautiful Book,This is a beautiful book. I first found the book at the thrift store so I ordered two for my nephews. My one nephew already had one. I do remember one of them came kind of tattered but again I don't remember which one. But the inside contents was fine and well worth the book.
4,Straightforward advice for the muddled,"I'm well past 40 but I still have trouble making decisions and looked at this book partly to see if it would be helpful for my daughter, who also has trouble making decisions. This is straightforward advice about how (in arriving at life decisions) to sort out your gut feelings, what other people expect of you, what's practical, and what you can live with -- with a useful section on how to be your own good boss instead of your own bad boss. Coming from the publishers of the Chicken Soup books , I am surprised to find something so immensely level-headed. I'm sending my copy to my daughter."
4,A major improvement in MS Press' FP reference books!,"Having purchased MS Press' FP 97 book to learn FP in a hurry, I was left a little disappointed. I think the book represented the fact that FP 97 itself needed improvement.I upgraded to FP 98 finally, and borrowed the Running MS FP 98 book form my company's MIS manager and after using it for 3 days, I just told him I was going to keep it. In fact, if it solves my current dilemma I may bronze this book.That is why I visited Amazon, I need to buy another copy for him, b/c he won't be able to expense another one.This book goes into much more detail in every topic I've explored so far. I was impressed by the info on the security of FP including detailed discussions about IIS and NT itself.The tips are great!ts"
3,Jagermeister CD,"While I'm a huge Jagermeister drinker, which is why I bought the cd, I wasn't as impressed with the music. It's not necessarily bad, it's just too mellow for me."
1,Do Not Buy,"Wonderful collection of songs, poorly remastered and badly recorded. If you love the music, you will hate this album."
1,The Best of Bobby Rydell,The songs on this album are all re-makes. They were recorded many years later than the original versions. The instrumental tracks are predominantly synthesized music done badly. The vocals lack the original emotion and spirit. Oldies should sound like they did as they were heard on the radio. Only the true original recordings bring back those nostalgic memories of days gone by. Buyer beware of oldies compilation CD's. Ask the clerk or write or E-mail the recording company for the music's authenticity.
2,Not very consistent,"I didn't like this book very much. It tries to cover a lot of items, but it doesn't cover them well. For example a lot of commands are just mentioned, but not really explained. And a lot of important things are missing. And what I really didn't like are the jumps in the level of the explanations. Some things are explained over and over again and others a little bit more complicated are mentioned as if they had been explained earlier. I wouldn't recommend this book, because for a beginner there are a lot of things not clearly explained and for an expert it is not really useful, because it's not very compact."
2,Littered with mistakes,"After reading the book cover to cover while preparing for the exam, I found that there were far too many errors. Some mistakes include answers to the chapter end tests not coinciding with the questions asked, index items not pointing you to the right pages(look up the print daemon, commands in the index). The mistakes left me with the feeling that this book was rushed out with out being proof read, leaving me with little confidence that the material I was reading was a good reflection of what would be on the exam. The CD provides 2 exams of 75 questions each that do not change each time you take them. Overall I felt the book did a good job with the topics that it covered, but would recommend you look elswhere for a book to help prepare you for the exam."
2,"was ok, not the best",I am preparing for the LPIC exam and have not found this book that helpful. I would strongly recommend purchasing any of the other LPIC study aids as well as a linux system administration book as a reference guide. I have found that combination particularly beneficial in my preparation. This book has potential but definitely needs to be rewritten.
5,Love it,"This product is super durable, which is great when you have a dog that loves to chew on your stuff! Besides that I am pleased with all other aspects of the lead. It has a simple and functional design, the clip is very secure and I love that it will also swivel as needed."
1,Only received one leash,"I intended to use this on my mini poodle. The only leash I received was the large black one. I am unable to use this leash with my small poodle. I had believed I would be receiving the three leashes in the picture.Other than that it is a well-made leash. It is a bit heavy though, even for a larger dog."
3,An introductory book,"This is the first book I bought for learning UNIX. I must say that I don't have any experience on UNIX before. I believe this is an introductory book rahter than the ""intermediate to advanced"" as claimed by the auothor. It really talks about UNIX, but it talks about many thing (internet, screen editors, etc) that relate to other OS as well (Mac, Windows NT, etc). I believe this book is for those readers who don't know anything about UNIX (like me), but definitely not for ""intermediate to advanced user"". A point to mention is that shell script is introduced at very beginning and this will confuse the beginners much (me again =)."
2,This book is not for beginners.,"This book is not for begginners, and is not thought out. The book covers shell scripting before it has even told the reader how to create an executable file."
5,A new view on Australa,"I very much enjoyed this novel and found it to be a real page-turner in that it was a tale of endeavour and continually emergent experiences. This novel touched on an area most Australian's seem to be little aware of and seem themselves to experience almost as a foreign country most notably the centre and north of this massive country/continent. Indeed an area that most of us won't experience whilst traversing the urban parts so well advertised by the brochures. As such I found it a fascinating contrast from that given by the rather conservative and urbanised travelogues I'd read on this country by Bill Bryson's `Down Under' although in itself an interesting travelogue. Bill Bryson's travelogue was the last book I bought for my brother when he left for Australia three years ago, this will be my next one."
5,"Thumbs Up, Mates!","If you have a sense of adventure, grab a copy of this book. While I would probably never hitchike the Australian Outback myself, I really enjoyed reading about someone's adventure doing just that. Tom Parry's book is witty and sharp, and made me laugh at various points, and to comtemplate this wild and untamed land. The book reminded me of another travel adventure, One For the Road, written by Tony Horwitz some 20 years ago. If you have ever had a desire to explore the unexplored, you will enjoy this book -- Thumbs Up!"
2,My least favorite Swedish Beauty lotion,"I've been using indoor tanning lotions, pretty consistently, for about 10 years and Swedish Beauty has always been my very favorite brand. I've tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite. It's thicker than most and the smell is terrible! You definitely don't want to use this unless you can shower right away - in addition to smelling bad, the smell seems to get worse after tanning. I go to an awesome salon and with their beds normally see a difference in my tan the day of my tanning session - not with this lotion. The only use I can see for this product is maybe as a pre-tan moisturizer if your skin is very dry. I have had much better results tanning using lotions without bronzers from SB. My current favorites from SB are Priceless and Bronze Beauty - pretty much the same lotion but Priceless is from their blush line. Both of those work great!!"
1,a typographical mess!,"This turned out to be one of those Print on Demand titles--and what a typographical, unreadable mess it is. Just a warning to anyone who may consider purchasing it."
4,Small cover,"First time buyer for umbrella covers and I got the wrong size. From the description in the ad I thought that it would fit. The cover is nice but not for a medium size umbrella. It's for a skinny one, not full size. I paid as much for the shipping as for the cover itself. Live and Learn."
4,Perfect cover!,Bought this cover for my 9-foot diameter market umbrella with thick wooden arms. It fits perfectly and suggly on the 9-footer. Can't imagine it would fit a similar 11-foot market umbrella.
1,Only for very small umbrellas,"These were designed for very narrow, small umbrellas and I could not even fit them over my umbrellas. I returned them and ordered lovely, large roomy ones from Brookstone for three times the price. I guess you get what you pay for..."
1,Good movie - impossible quality,"The first two copies I got were simply unable to play on my DVD player - simply wouldn't read and kept saying error. I finally got a third copy that also wouldn't read but I was finally able to watch it on my state of the art Imac. Go figure! This is a fascinating movie with a lot of twists and turns and suspense if you're able to watch it. I think the studio that released this, Venevision, has a lot of quality problems."
1,Avoid,This book throws random words and phrases at you without building up any sort of consistent vocabulary or grammer. You'd be better of buying a tourist's phrase book. At least it would have categories.
4,"Great text, but watch those typos!","This text offers many, many pieces of good advice and many insights into the internals of the Oracle server. It is one of the the top two or three book s on the subject and as such, is easy to recommend. BUT, be very careful of most example scripts. Many have syntax errors (which is strange , given they are clearly 'cut and paste' from a screen dump). If you are an experienced DBA, you will spot them on reading. At worst they will be obvious when they generate an error. However for the less experienced, there could be some frustrating moments. This is very disappointing for the second edition of a book (some of the grammar leaves alot to be desired too!). Also on the downside, the book claims to include updates for Oracle 8, but this is a rather generous claim, Many examples or recommendations are redundant in an Oracle 8 environment but are not identified as such. Overall though, still a worthwhile part of any DBA's toolkit."
4,"Badly needs updating, typos corrected and much better index",This is the best overall book on Oracle Tuning but the editors were sloppy in weeding out the typos--no excuse for a second edition book. The index is one of the worst that I've ever seen in a technical book; sometimes you practically have to look at every page to find what you're looking for because of the way the book is organized.
4,Concern about typo-errrors throughout the book,"Eventhough I like this book very much,I concern about some examples the author showsin the book. For eample, in the chk_nxtext.sql script, the author mentions about sys.Free_Blocks table, which does not exist in ORACLE database version 7.0 to 7.3"
5,I had no idea!!!,"First of all, I own an H3. I use it for off-road use and it snows up here in the mountains where I live and it comes in handy. I had no idea about what the thought process was in creating this vehicle. There were a few questions I had and this book pretty much cleared them up. I would recommend this book to all H3 owners and to those interested in what it takes and what goes into production of a vehicle. As far as I'm concerned, the H3 functions as indended. Are there things that could be better? sure, but most of those are addressed in this book. The book is well written and has great pictures. Lots of drawings and prototypes. Very well put together. The author did an outstanding job."
4,What they promised is what I got,"I've been very lucky with amazon since a lot of the times I end up receiving my products earlier than expected. This one I got it in time, not earlier but just in time so I can't complain. Very well paked, no damage, it was good/"
3,NOT for beginners!,"If you already know quite a little about Java (I mean, you have finished reading at least one whole book about Java basics), maybe this is a good book to explore the OO aspects of Java. But this book is definitely NOT for the beginners. It is crazy to use it as a textbook in an intro CS class. If you happen to be a self-study guy, it would be a nightmare."
2,"An ambitious attempt, but falters badly","My business card says ""software engineer"" but I code very little. This book is the text for an introductory computer science course I am taking. While I admire the authors' attempt at putting Objects First in the curriculum, they have only succeeded in confusing and alienating a number of my classmates with little programming experience. The most glaring weaknesses are the the relatively few, undistinguished examples, and the lack of rigor in teaching Java syntax and semantics. The authors' freely admit that they do not attempt to teach Java itself, but this ultimately leaves students stranded as they peruse the hundreds of Java titles at the local bookstore, looking for a decent language reference. Lastly, they mix a lot of software engineering practice in with the actual computer science. While topics such as programming by contract and software quality are important, I am not convinced that this material is suited for students at the beginning level."
3,Not Enough Culture,"Theodore Mommsen's Provinces of the Roman Empire will provide an indescribable wealth of material for readers concerned with Rome's military history, expansion and growth, from Caesar to Diocletian. While this book lacks the eloquence and depth of Gibbon, and reads more like reference material than pure history, it still must be regarded as the foremost authority upon the subjects it covers. The only real negative about this immense work is the fact that rarely is anything said about culture. Its hard to believe that a book illuminating the history of the provinces has almost entirely overlooked the cultural impact Rome had on the provinces and likewise that the provinces had on Rome."
2,Not nearly enough information on design,"This book is OK, but gives the impression that you will learn how to design a SQL Server 2000 database, not as an academic computer science exercise, but for what I need it for - work!There's only 4 chapters on the design, not nearly enough information on normalization, and the remainder of the book - using SQL Server 2000 - was covered far more comprehensively in Rob Veera's book from Wrox Press.In short, OK for a complete beginner but not nearly enough meat for those who need to know this information on a daily basis."
1,Nightmare...,"Headaches..Headaches..Headaches..I personally go through a lot of technical books. This one is a nightmare. If you like to read books that are just get to the point, then this book is not for you. The writing style so horrible that I have to take a break on almost every 3-4 pages. This book claimed that it is for all level. However, I honestly don't think this book is for a beginner person. If you are looking for an entry-level book on the SQL 2000, I would recommend ""SQL Server 2000 Programming"" from Wrox."
2,Not recommended,"I am a hairdresser and used to better products.I would not recommend them.They don't cut the hair right,hardly at all actually.I sent mine back."
3,Reasonable but not amazing,"Decent clippers, plastic fittings are kinda cheap and dont always clip on/off easily. Bare blades do not cut very close either. Otherwise works quite well and the cordless function is fantastic!"
4,Got my money worth,"We bought this for my son when he needed a haircut because it was easier to cut his hair at home then take him to a hairdresser. We like this because it's wireless. Like all clipper, it makes the buzz sound, which my son is kind of scared of, but as long as we distract him, it doesn't bug him. We dropped the trimmer once, and broke the #1 clip, so we use it without the clip, and it still works great.Saved us a lot of money by not taking my son to the hairdresser."
4,vidal sasson,"My boyfriend is really happy with the product allthough the case is really bad I give that no stars. It doesnt close unless you put every piece in perfectly and it does not hold anything in place very bulky plastic, they couldve done better. Otherwise the razor works great!"
3,Movie,This was an okay movie. I've never seen it and wanted to give it a shot. I had no problems ordering it and viewing it.
4,Good movie!,I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and am glad I decided to rent it. It's a classic and must see for anyone.
5,A++ Master Thriller,"Dan(Douglas) a New York lawyer married with Beth(Archer) has a weekend affair with Alex(Close) a dangerous and sexy blonde he barely know.He started this relationship but later he'll regret it.He wants to cut things with Alex but she wasn't to be ignored, so she starts to ruin Dan's life as well his family.She calls her home constantly broke Dan's car and kidnap his daughter.When he belived that Alex won't strikes back she appears in his bath trying to cut things with her wife too late,Dan can struggle with her drowning her in the bathtub,she survives and Beth shots her killing her instantly.A good finale instead of the first one shooted and you can she in the Dvd.A great classic of the 80's with great acting,story and director."
2,"Good DVD, Great Movie","I'm happy. I'd seen this movie years ago, and now I own it. It was great seeing it again. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over; whereas, most movies--seeing them once is enough so I just rent them from Netflix. This one's a keeper."
2,Way too overrated!,A pretentious and predictable thriller which fails to thrill or offer anything new. Michael Douglas risks it all by by cheating on his wife with Close one day. Yet of course Glenn still wants him and it all goes nightmarish after a while. Good cast is wasted in typically inept Lyne movie.
4,EFFECTIVE THRILLER,"Adrian Lyne, who directed the soft-porn 9 1/2 Weeks, directs this movie like a slick, sexy video. What is amazing is that, despite the slickness and manipulative imagery, the peformances are so good that it gets right under your skin. Glenn Close transforms into Alex, the discarded other woman, with so much brutality and energy that you virtually cannot escape the terror she brings upon Michael Douglas and his unsuspecting family. For my money though, Anne Archer is the performer who gives this movie its much-needed heart, and the reason why so many people found this movie incredibly compelling and disturbing: if Anne Archer, the perfect wife and mother, could be cheated on, where does that leave the rest of us? Her warmth in inhabiting her role gives the movie a dime on which to turn. The slasher ending, which I understand was a re-shoot, feels false and way over-the-top, but I defy you not to root for the heroine in the most visceral way."
3,Interesting but flawed 80's movie.,"Plot Summary: Man has affair with woman. Woman is psycho. Woman stalks man...FA is more than that though. It is typical of it's time, being flashy, simplistic and moralistic. Single women are dangerous. Wives are there to take care of the family. Men cannot be blamed for having affairs. Etc.Nonetheless, I would attest that this (along with Cocktail) are the defining films of late 80's Hollywood.The bunny scene is quite good though."
4,Borderline Personality in Extemis,"At bit over the top but portrays all of the features of Borderline Personality in extremis, keeps the audience on edge.Glenn Close is excellent as always."
4,Some triangles can threaten your life...,"Glenn Close: The mature but hot babe most men would want to sleep with--- for a weekend. Anne Archer: The kind of woman the same men would want to live with for a lifetime. Michael Douglas: The kind of successful stud who gets to choose. Unfortunately for him, his choice to try to have both simultaneously almost gets everyone killed. As a cautionary tale which reveals that the category of ""sex-obsessed psycho-stalker"" is not limited to one gender, this one satisfies. The scary ending goes on a bit too long, and one wonders how Anne and Michael recover from the danger in the weeks and months after the movie ends. However, as entertainment and a warning about the dark side of adultery, this is quite effective."
4,Scary for all the right reasons or not?,"Everyone knows what this movie is all about, so there's no point in summarizing the plot. But much was made about Michael Douglas's role as Everyman, at least everyman who's ever taken advantage of a woman and then not faced up to his responsibility. Yet Glenn Close is such an over-the-top nutcase, one wonders if whatever ""truths"" were aimed at become meaningless because of that. The movie is very scary in a taut thriller sort of way. If faithless men were supposed to squirm over this movie, however, they do so for the same reason everyone who sees it does: there's a lunatic on the loose here."
3,He didn't mean to turn her on,"Husband and father has an affair with a co-worker but as he expects to keep it as just an affair and dump her off when his family comes back, she won't let him. She then proceeds to make threats until she turns to murder to get her point across. Very realistic and very frightening sex thriller that opens eyes to the dangers of dramatic emmotions. Close is excellent as the chemically enbalanced psycho."
3,This Is For The 24 Hour Digital Rental Version,"Where's the ending bathroom climax with the shooting?? It has been left out!! Other than that, it's a very good movie that is well-paced and with developed characters."
5,Great movie!,The video loaded quickly on my computer and it was great quality! I was able to enjoy the movie with no problems or interruption! Great service!
5,great movie,"This is one of those movie that is good to have in your collection, if you enjoy thrillers. Great quality picture and sound."
3,GLENN CLOSE PORTRAYED ONE OF THE SCARIEST VILLAINS.,"""Fatal Attraction"" moves from an infidelity anecdote to a psychological thriller in a blink from an eye thanks to Glenn Close's magnificent performance. You can really hate the character of Alex Forrester, however the only victims are Dan Gallagher's wife Beth, and their little daughter Ellen.One of the biggest successes of ""Fatal Attraction"" is the fact that the movie doesn't justifies Dan's infidelity, the plot doesn't make him neither an innocent victim nor a martyr. ""Fatal Attraction"" shows that all our actions will have a consequence, and Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) is as guilty as Alex.""Fatal Attraction"" is one of the most popular films of the 1980s decade, and brought fame to the careers of Michael Douglas, and Glenn Close thanks to her excellent performance."
5,"THIS DELICIOUS MOVIE, IS THE REASON WHY I OWN A DVD PLAYER!","THERE ARE MANY MOVIES, THAT ARE LONG OVERDUE, THAT SHOULD BE ON DVD. WITHOUT A DOUBT, BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT, BEYOND ALL DOUBTS, ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES. DESPITE THE INJUSTICE OF THE ACADEMY, THAT YEAR, (IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THOUGH, AFTER ALL THE ACADEMY NEVER RECOGNIZED ALFRED HITCHCOCK WITH AN OSCAR EITHER) GLENN CLOSE'S PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE YEAR 1987 OR ANY YEAR SINCE. THERE HAS BEEN NO OTHER ACTRESS, BEFORE OR SINCE, WHO HAS CAPTURED THE RANGES OF EMOTIONS, THAT GLENN CLOSE DISPLAYS IN ""FATAL ATTRACTION"". FROM SEXY SEDUCTION TO ANGER REJECTION, FROM LONELY DESPERATION TO HOMICIDAL PSYCHO, GLENN CLOSE'S PERFORMANCE, IN ""FATAL ATTRACTION"", IS NOTHING SHORT OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS OF ANY ACTRESS, OR ACTOR, IN MOVIE HISTORY!!! FOR THE FEW, WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN ""FATAL ATTRACTION""...ARE YOU IN, FOR A TREAT!!!"
2,Two MAJOR flaws with this movie:,"The first flaw: the ending (which, as many people know, was not the original ending but was substituted after test audiences panned the first ending). ...The second flaw: Asking me to believe that a man married to Anne Archer would have an affair with Glenn Close, one of the least sexy actresses of all time, is asking too much. I could not suspend my disbelief to that extent."
1,Depressing and upsetting,"I wanted to reach out and punch Michael Dougles' character. He displays the arrogant attitude some men have that their needs are different from women's. I couldn't agree with Alex more when she challenged him why he allowed this when he was so happy in his marriage. OK, I was happy with the ending. Alex died and the family remained intact. But I am a confirmed rabbit lover. That is why I can't handle this movie."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Fatal Attraction kinda flies off the handle in its increasingly over-the-top and hard-to-swallow third act, but it's an interesting enough thriller to be worth recommending despite its slight implosion; with good performances by Douglas and Close, it's a movie that has etched itself into our cultural consciousness."
2,Ho-hum,"This movie was okay. The first 30 minutes were kind of a drag. I'm not exactly sure why this film garnered as much attention as it did. I made note of the old style taxi cabs, the big shoulder pads on women's clothing, and the telephones with cords.Glenn Close was quite creepy and did a good job drawing the line between sanity and insanity. When she slit her wrists and wiped it on Michael Douglas - that should have been his cue to run away from her!! In the scene where they ate spaghetti, it made me want to eat spaghetti all of a sudden.Other than that, kind of boring, we all knew she was going to snap, it was alot of waiting to see it happen. Didn't really enjoy the film."
3,late 80's crazy in New York,This movie is just a nasty story of a womanwho slept with the wrong guyand wouldn't let go?I think it is a sign of the times wheremorals and social decay catch up with a modern successful lawyeron his way up.I really didn't like this movie.

4,One of my Top Ten Movies,"Since I have seen this movie about a thousand times, it never cease to amaze me how Beth is so submissive. She is irrational and weak. Did you see how she just ran out of school when her daughter wasn't there? Didn't she think to call Dan and see if he picked up the child? Everyone thinks Alex is the bad woman but she is not, she possesses positive traits that Beth lacks. Alex is organized, canecious, dominating and most of all sexy. I admire Alex, she had guts. And that's why I LUV this movie..."
1,If,"... you are married to Anne Archer and want a fling with Glen Close, don't ever worry trying getting help from a shrink : no one could help you there. The best thing would be getting committed for life, because you're not even pathetic, you're hopeless. Unless you're a pervert and a jerk of the first magnitude.The problem with this movie was not the script, it was the casting, which made the whole story completely preposterous, unless you have very very very poor eyesight (or you are also a kind of pervert)."
1,Damn Gory Movie - Flashy & Stupid,"Very typical of movies from the 1980's. Materialism, Sex, Violence, Gore, really dull dialogue lines (which means they have to make up for it with all the gore and sex and violence), and to top it all off, a strong woman character villain (typical of the genre of feminist backlash prevelant in the 1980's - thank you Susan Fauldi, author of Backlash). I had heard about the rabit scene from the two people who recommended it but was not impressed when I did see it. The wrist slashing scene was pretty good; the ending, with her bloated choked body floating in the water and that fako bullet hole in the end was also tasteless. I just don't see someone going that far. No good probing on the questions of love or adultury or marriage as social contract vs passion. THis is truly for audiences of the 1980's; I'll stick with more stuff out of the 1970's - at least we saw some degree of taste and plot and character dev. back then. None of that in this flick."
3,Frustrating,"First time I opened the DVD case, the first DVD was loose & scratched. The 2nd time I opened it, an hour later, a piece broke off inside. How cheaply made can it possibly be?!"
3,Can't play this classic on DVD,The DVD is not made to show in this region (USA) and would not play on any of our three DVD players. I finally was able to go in and change the laptop settings to reflect REGION 2 which was the United Kingdom and watch the movie. I don't think it should have been sold without a notification about the region issue. It is a great classic movie and except for the limiting factors of the laptop was enjoyed.
5,"""Alex, the bunny's innocent!""","This was one great movie. I bought the DVD because I was curious about the original ending where Glenn Close's character commits suicide.After watching it, I still prefer the cinematic ending as I thought many would have appreciated the confrontation between the wife and other woman.The way Alex Forrest began to show signs that she's a complete crackpot was genius. She seemed normal at first, ageeing to an affair and then acting all possessive as if Dan owes her. The thing that really got me petrified was that she took out her rage on that cute innocent rabbit.It was really masterful, the way the story goes from sexy illicit romance to full horror. During the 1987 screening, I nearly jumped outta my seat when Anne Archer wiped the mirror to see Alex lurking behind.The audio quality is rather soft on this one so thanks for the subtitles. I laughed out loud when Alex screamed at the phone operator ""f#$k you!"" only to have him ask ""your place or mine?"""
3,Wise to Have Waited,"In all the years this movie has been out I have never watched it. I finally decided to see what everyone thought was so great. I was disappointed, not nearly as good as I had heard."
3,Close Minded,"This is another one of Michael Douglas' thriller chillers. They are all pretty much the same by now, but when this was released it created quite a buzz. One night of cheating with Glenn Close was more than he bargained for. Wifey was away, but comes back and poor Mike thinks that life will go on as usual. Not if Glenn has her say. And, she more than does in this flick.She is like a spider, weaving a web to catch poor Mike. She tries every trick in the book, calling on the phone, attempting suicide, saying she is pregnant, blowing up his car, and driving Mike to the edge of insanity where she lives.When she takes his daughter on a whim, boils her rabbit, the struggle becomes real personal and gets out of total control. Needless to say, the ending will prove that demented Glenn, once a spider, is harder to kill than a cockroach.Glenn Close's performance makes the movie watchable. Other than that, the other actors are just wooden puppets."
5,"Glenn Close is really, truly scary in this one","What superb casting. Director Adrian Lyne has crafted a not-your-average stalker/thriller that gathered six Academy Award nominations. The dialogue of this freaky and progressively scarier and scarier film rings absolutely true, and terrific acting keep everything together and viewers on the edge of their seats. It all starts with a quickie, a weekend fling by Michael Douglas. He's over it in a couple of days, but SHE is NOT. She's mad enough to...well, mad enough to boil a bunny, the film's 2nd most gripping scene. Watch it yourself to learn what the MOST gripping scene is.Yowtch! It's a good one."
5,FATAL ATTRACTION INTRIGUE,JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S A MOVIE THAT KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SEE IT. I SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT EVERYTIME. I HAVE A QUESTION. WHAT IS THE LITTLE GIRLS NAME IN THE MOVIE? WAS IT ELLIE? WHAT'S HER REAL NAME? HAS SHE BEEN IN ANYMORE MOVIES? SHE WAS GREAT IN THE SHOW AND LOOKS LIKE A POSSIBLE ACTRESS TO REMEMBER. THANKS FOR ANY HELP OR ANSWERS.
2,Average Re-Thread but good storyline,"while the Song itself is pretty much a Knock Off of ""The boy is Mine""&a few other things because I can pinpoint where Kayne West gets some of His Suff from,the storyline is interesting.Brandy Vocally though is not as Good as She was back in the day.Her Voice is missing a certain spark.She still has the Cross-Over vibe in Her Material that will always get Her some kind of a Hit but that doesn't mean you are gonna get solid results from Her vocal chops anymore."
3,The Teen Returns,"I just sometimes look at younger artists, and just realize how difficult it really is to focus in on a good song. For Brandy, she ultimately has had some ups and doubtful downs in the past few years. With a flunked marriage, and a great sense of becoming a mother, she still has a good feeling of making some decent tracks. Her latest single, Talk About Our Love, is a assertive, but mixed blend of Soul & Hip Hop style. Arguably, I've only heard the song a few times, and it really isn't one of her best songs. It does sound good for the time being, but it doesn't match her previous collaborations with Whitney Houston, Wayna Morris on Brokenhearted, and especially Monica with The Boy Is Mine. Nevertheless, Talk About Our Love with Kayne West isn't bad, but very much fair and not over the top."
5,Flag Reference Extrodinaire!,"Despite it being 27 years old (and as a result, having a number of now-obsolete flags in it's world flags segment), Dr. Smith has made a wonderful book of flag history, definitions, and other information for those folks like me who are intrigued by flags. This book (taking into account it's age) is by far the best reference book on flags that I now have. Thank you, Dr. Smith."
1,Disappointingly flawed,"After looking at local antique stores for a vintage-esque linen cabinet, I finally went online and looked at many more options. I liked the style of this piece, but when I received it I immediately noticed a number of dents and cracks in the wood. Not wanting to discount it just yet, and thinking I could work around it, I began to assemble the cabinet and found that while the boards were helpfully labelled, the instructions were less than user-friendly and several screws were missing. In addition, the drawer pulls did not attach completely, despite attempts from a professional carpenter to work with them. It's a big pain to have to return a large piece of ready-to-assemble furniture, and I regret the purchase. It's a good sized piece for smaller storage spaces, but it's not worth the frustration of a three-hour assembly time and disappointly flawed wood and hardware."
1,Disappointed buyer,"I loved the design and functionality of this cabinet and I still do. When they stated assembly required, they weren't kidding. No piece is pre-assembled. All pieces are labeled. The holes are pre-drilled, however at this time I am looking for another set of drawer handles because the holes missed the mark. The instructions are not very clear. One part is written in Japanese/Chinese(?). My husband and I managed to put the cabinet together in about 2 hours not counting the hour to figure out the instructions. Overall, on close inspection, the finished product looks like a cheaply put together cabinet vs a solid construction because the junctions are not a tight fit.I'd rate the cabinet a 5/5 for functionality, and because of the labor involved and trouble to look for matching drawer handles I'd pay $50.00 for this cabinet and rate it a 1/5 with a recommendation of ""Do not buy"" unless you are willing to overpay."
4,Family gothic... spooky and enjoyable,"This might not be a book for everyone, but if you're into weird and suspenseful tales, you ought to like this book. it was an actual chance find for me, since I found this book at the thrift store, 3 paperbacks for 99 cents. It looked interesting, and I was right. If you're a fan of V.C. Andrews (Flowers in the Attic, Petals on the Wind) you might like this book. My only problem is that I wish this book could have been more detailed.Some of the plot points had a lot of potential to be used, but it wasn't really taken advantage of, since some parts felt somewhat skimpy. It would have been nice to see more of what had happened to Paul and Constance and Margaret. I also felt that Paul (Sr.) wimped out with what he did to himself - honestly, he should have just dealt with it. Nonetheless, it was a decent book, and I liked it."
1,"Disturbing, couldn't wait to get rid of it","Those who want to avoid reading emotionally disturbing books filled with rape, incest and child molestation would do well to avoid this. Truly the worst book I've ever read and I hope it never crosses my path again."
4,Great Cat,"The catalytic converter did not look new like the picture you see on amazon. It looked a little faded due to shelf life or something but, I did fit perfectly and my car is a lot more fuel efficient. No problems yet and I doubt that there will be because magnaflow is a great company with great products!"
4,good catalytic for the money,"good catalytic for the money, the only problem is louder than regular catalytic but if you don't mind the noise, great buy my tuck sounds like a infinity fx35"
4,"Family-friendly, eco-conscious entertainment at its best","This hour-long tape contains 2 episodes from the 1973 Japanese anime series 'Fables of the Green Forest,' which was based on ""Old Mother West Wind"" by Thornton Burgess (aka 'Bedtime Story-Man'), and features many of the characters from that book.The first episode is about the titular Mr. and Mrs. Quack, who were sort of 'guest stars' for this particular story, as ducks who encounter some obstacles on their journey northward. The usual gang of forest critters (Jimmy Skunk, Sammy Jay, Rocky Chuck) help protect them from hunters and the wily Reddy Fox.The second episode, 'Peter Cottontail Changes His Name,' well, that's pretty self-explanatory and it's tone is more overtly humorous, although there is a lesson for kids, too.The animation in these cartoons is quite striking and, at times, even beautiful, comparing well to the work of - dare I say it? - Hayao Miyazaki."
1,A Very Big Disappointment,"This book is not worth the paper it's printed on. It does not describe the INTERNAL of ASP. This book does not bring any value to any ASP programmer, novice or experienced.I have had high hope on this book since it came from DevelopMentor, which I have attended many of its classes and been very happy with its instructors. A very big disppointment on this book."
4,Update to a previous review,"The source code is now available at Addison Wesley, but still no errata :-)"
4,Great resource to get you thinking,"My attending on Gen Surg in 3rd year clerkships required that I read this before i started. It was a quick read, that really gets you thinking about diagnosis. I would recommend that all med students, regardless of profession, read it."
2,Too long to get into,"This book takes way too long to grab a reader into it. The characters are kind of interesting, but sometimes it seemed the author was having problems trying to figure out what the character was doing,which could of been better, without trying to give away too much. The ending was fairly well written, although predictable, but again it just takes too much time to get here. This is one book in the series that I would not take the time to go back and re-read it."
3,Old Fashioned and Creepy,"This is a really old fashioned, creepy campaign novel for Ravenloft, as they reissue old 1900s TSR novels, concentrating on Ravenloft with the 1990s novels. A lot of this stuff is hard to find and out of print."
2,boring...,"Sorry, but I cannot agree to the other review posted here. I found this novel rather boring and lacking the constant atmosphere of dread that each good horror story should have. I think it is the worst book of the series I read so far, but it does have a nice cover though. But should one judge a book by it's cover ? And another thing, all the other Ravenloft-novels were blue in color, why is this one...ahm...reddish brown ?"
5,Historical fiction that is historical.,"The popularity of the romances of Georgette Heyer, who defined the ""regency romance"" genre, continues after her demise. ""An Infamous Army,"" details the events prior to and following the Battle of Waterloo with a realism that is acute. Ms. Heyer uses characters from previous books, ""The Devil's Cub,"" ""Regency Buck,"" and refers to characters from ""These Old Shades"" to build this enthralling romance that has no happy ending.Reading the four (her only series) is a visit with old friends, when you need a fix for good writing, strong characters, good dialogue, and a firm sense of a historical period.Nash Black, author of ""Taxes, Stumbling Blocks and Pitfalls for Authors 2007"" and ""Qualifying Laps."""
3,"If you like history, and can pass up the romance","Georgette Heyer wrote a terrific history of Waterloo - so well done, in fact, that both Sandhurst (in the UK) and West Point (in the US) have used this book in their military classes. However, her popularity was largely for romances, and she inserts one here, which doesn't completely meld. If you like history, you may want to skip the fiction. If you like romance, you may want to skim past the battle details. If you like both, however, you will really enjoy this. A better work of Heyer's is ""The Spanish Bride"", which combines a true romance with the true military details of the Peninsular War. She has less difficulty joining the threads of that book, since the characters were real, and she took most of her information from their memoirs. As an aside, it is a mild pleasure to see the descendants or relatives of characters from other Heyer novels."
3,Um... did someone say this was romance?,"Since I read ""These Old Shades"" last year I have loved Heyer completely and have spent a small fortune acquiring her books. This, I have to say, was one of the rare disappointments. I suppose one could enjoy this book very much if one were interested in Wellington and the war. The book is very well researched and absolutely perfect in the war aspect. But for someone who picks up a Heyer to immerse herself in heady romance, it is bound to be a disappointment."
3,"I love this author's books, but","This book seemed to bog down. I know waterloo was a horrible battle and I learned some from this book, but for some reason the book dragged."
4,True historical romance,Fictional and historical figures together to describe the Battle of Waterloo both from the military and civilian perspective. Readers of Georgette Heyer's other works will recognise some old friends as well.An excellent read!
5,One of the best,This is one of the best of Heyer's books in my opinion. I became so interested in the Battle of Waterloo that I searched and read several other essays on this topic. Heyer uses several quotes of Wellington's in the book. It is a very accurate account of the battle. It brings to life the human tragedy and the horrific toll taken on all that are caught up in the unfolding horrors of war. The first two books in the trilogy should be read first to develop an understanding for the Alastair family.
3,"An Admixture of History, Biography and Romance","Of the several historical romances by Heyer that I read prior to Infamous Army, I very much appreciated Heyer's attention to detail in accurately portraying language, manner and custom and in avoiding anachronisms. Her scholarship was evident in the quality of her work without her work feeling scholarly. Infamous Army, on the other hand, feels like a text book. Frankly, I think I skimmed well over half the book in order to get past the biographical presentation of Wellington and the historical presentation of the Battle of Waterloo. I suppose I should have paid better attention to the subtitle, for it accurately foretold what the novel principally contains: Wellington, Waterloo and war. It was not my favorite."
4,an infamous army,Had a lot of war details that I skipped but a good story with a heroine that is kinda a bad girl which is different in a typical noval of this period
3,"not his best, but still the fantastic Baum","In the Land of Oz, where animals talk and logic is delightfully warped and fairies mingle with mortals and clockwork men, Betsy Bobbin and her mule Hank are shipwrecked. Along with Queen Ann's army, Polychrome, the Shaggy Man, Ozga (the Rose Princess), and Tik Tok, Betsy and Hank find themselves on a rescue mission for Shaggy's brother imprisoned by the selfish Nome King. Filled with Baum's signature Romanticism and clever logic, it's a lovely (though not particularly unique or as distinct) addition to the Oz series. The Marvelous Land of Oz and The Tin Woodman of Oz are still the strongest in the series. Grade: B"
5,Great series,"I started reading this series with my son back in October. He turned 4 in June and we'd just started reading chapter books in the fall and I was looking for great stories without the presence of annoying pop culture. The Oz books were recommended by a trusted friend and I was skeptical at first, especially at his age, but the first book is so much better than the movie, and each subsequent book has been better than the last. After checking a couple different versions out from the library we now make sure to always get the books with the original illustrations by John R. Neill (the Dover 1980s and 90s reprints are the best). I don't know what we'll do when we reach the end of the series!"
5,Books of OZ,We have been buying the series of OZ books called 'books of wonder'. They are so well made and make a wonderful library addition for young children. Couldn't be more pleased with the quality.
5,Great Oz book,"This a great tale. It's humorous, adventureous, and at sometimes even a little scarey. This book is definetly one of the funniest in the series."
4,only for the true hard core Ja. fans,"I feel that I have a better knowledge than most pertaining towards reggae music and this one is a keeper. It is a mix of 3 seperate artist with the inclusion of Buju Banton.If you are looking for the ""frat boy"" reggae selections stay away from this disc. If you are looking to expand your Jamaican musical home selection , this is a must. respect"
2,Has some significant shortcomings,"Readers who have some experience working in a large manufacturing plant might be able to identify with how Joe runs his garage project, but those with no experience in manufacturing may be left with little appreciation for the story. The depiction of American manufacturing in the pamphlet is getting old. American managers have grown tired of hearing how a Japanese approach is superior and of needing to use terms such as kaizen and poka-yoke when talking about lean thinking. If the Japanese approach is so superior, why are many manfacturing companies have trouble competing in today's global market? This approach can get in the way of adoption of lean thinking. Many of the terms in the glossary are not used in the book.On the positive side the book does provide a number of bad practices, management and production."
2,nice try,"Boring knock-off of the goal. The stories analogy was a little to transparent, but the portrayal of Joe was amusing because I am sure everybody knows someone like him. I did not like how predictable the story was, but the book did not take any more than one hour of my time."
2,LAME,"I found this book to be a waste of time. To me, it was nothing but a critique on late 20th century manufacturing processes. It was mostly a book on common sense approaches to lean manufacturing. I can't imagine that anybody uses the cumbersome processes and cultures that were ""improved"" during the course of this short story. Don't waste your money."
2,Heere we go again...,"Another book fawning all over Toyota and the Japanese as being the absolute masters of production. No one but them can possibly produce anything properly. Oh, wait, did this book mention that it was AMERICANS who showed the Japanese modern production methods immediately after WWII? By golly, they left out that little detail.. you probably don't hear that too much, but look it up if you don't believe me. For all of the 1950's and most of the 1960's, ""Made in Japan"" was not a good thing to see on a product. Only in the past 30 years have they gotten good. I won't deny that American companies have gotten sloppy, and they need a cold hard slap to wake them up. But, I think that some of these books go a little overboard heaping praise on Japanese methods."
2,BASIC....,"This book is a situational review of a back yard application of manufacturting. If you know NOTHING about manufacturing, this book is a great intro. If you are looking for a more detailed introduction to Scheduling, Work Centers, Routing, Materials Management, Bills of Material, Inventory, and Demand Planning, this book is a complete waste of your time."
1,Heinous,"This is pretty low-grade stuff. While I applaud the credentials and spirit of the writer, I was saddened by the tone of the book. It read like a summary of how Linux will instill peace,love, and happiness the world over.A little less worship of Linux, a little more Strategy would've helped immensely. 100+ pages of resources and consultants ? An entire chapter on ""Care and feeding of a sysadmin"" ...good lord.As an IS manager, if you took this book to me to prove Linux a viable solution, I'd laugh you out the door. This book feels like it was written to jump on the Linux bandwagon. More thought was necessary in the development."
5,I have this on sale.,I have it by luck. check out e-bay....while supply last. I don't have much left only but 18 of it.
3,For the NPR junkie,"I listen to National Public Radio primarily for the news programs. I've had this book for a while & finally read it. Noah Adams has been a co-host of their evening news program, All Things Considered (ATC), for many years. This book is a journal he wrote of a year of ATC, roughly June 1989 to June 1990. The book is more interesting for the insight it gives to how the program is put together rather than the actual stories themselves. You learn how reporters & anchors research and write the stories, & you find out what other people such as producers & engineers do. The reason I didn't give it more than 3 stars is that the book never really grabbed me. It is a good bedtime book in that it is broken up into individual days from one to a few pages, so you can read a little or a lot & then turn out the light & sack out."
5,Designer's Dream,"Extremely inspirational. As a knitwear designer, I can't wait to try out some of the ideas that this book generated."
5,Complete and Factual,"As an instructor in the emergency management field, I found this book to be concise and on-target with respect to preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters...both public and private. Mr. Laye's ability to convey the reason and methods of preparedness and response is apparently based on experience and in-depth research. Well outlined and a must for any manager concerned with business survival following virtually any disaster."
1,I never received this item,Now I'm going to make sure I wasn't billed for it since I never received it.
4,"An excellent book, but in the wrong order","I found this book to be an excellent book, despite others reviews. Definitely not for beginners, but a good read for anyone with some programming experience. What others have interpreted as lack of support for those with less experience in the language, I have noticed tends to be simply badly ordered chapters - There are some more advanced discussions at the beginning, and some introductory chapters later on..."
2,For experienced Java 1.1 programmers only,"If you've never programmed in Java before, skip this one. The books says you have the necessary background for this book if you've coded in C/C++, but you need a firm grasp of AWT and 1.1 classes before using this book.This is evident no sooner than chapter 3 which discusses Java 1.2's extended security model. This is an important topic worthy of discussion, but not between introducing 1.2 API's and applet programming.No depth as mentioned in the above reviews. Only worth your time as a reference, maybe."
3,Please ignore my latest review,"To put a long story short,Java 1.2 Unleashed has nothing to do with the previous titles in the series. I thought it was a book that actually HAD chapters for the beginner when I bought the book, but nope, the author was serious when saying 'experts only'. So, do NOT buy this book if you're a newbie.This doesn't mean all experts should buy the book, though. The 60-70 pages on Swing are a perfect example of how Swing should NOT be introduced. The same stands for thread deprecation.To summarize, only buy this book if you're interested in EITHER the enterprise APIs OR Java2D / non-standard API's (e.g. JavaMail).Werner Zsolt"
3,Chicago VII is a fair CD,"Chicago VII has some pretty good stuff in it. Most of the first half is made up of jazz compositions (which I still have yet to get used to). Includes 'I've Been (Searchin' So Long)', 'Wishing You Were Here', and 'Call on Me'. 'Life Saver' is a catchy tune, and 'Byblos' is good for a melancholy mood."
4,Arguably the most underrated band of all time!,"Its amazing to me how under appreciated this band really is. Of all the books Ive read on music its crazy what little mention this band recieves (if any mention at all). This album further proves there abilty to to mix different styles of music almost flawlessly creating a unique fresh sound that is so hard to come by nowadays. Each member of the band handles there parts exceptionally and although this is a long album I was rarely ever bored. Chicago has delivered some of the most enduring pop rock of all time! They may not get critical praise, but there still the seconed most succesful american band ever! the people have spoken."
5,One of Chicago's best Albums.......,"This was one of the first albums I ever purchased. Great album. A nice mixture of rock and jazz.Of particular interest was the song ""I've been searching so long"". Fabulous song. Well written. Well played.I have read some of the previous reviews and those people have too much time on their hands. They have decided to be too critical of this particular cd. I wonder why??Is there any album or cd that is absolutely perfect???? NOOOOOO!!!!! Most cd's have albums that we can live without. But we buy them anyway because we like what the group is doing.So buy this album already. It has jazz. It has rock. It has easy listening. And it is not to be missed. Sit down and pop it into the cd player and have a drink. Remember when you were growing up and first heard this album. Then you WILL agree that this is one of Chicago's best albums."
4,Excellent and a half,"In general, Chicago became more commercial as they went along. By the mid 1970s, they were mainly a singles band.But you would not spot the trend listening to this album. It opens with an excellent side-long jam which at times reminds me of Santana's jazzier excursions around this time.There is also fantastic, sophistcated pop, such as ""Happy Man,"" and ""Wishing You Were Here."" Bossa nova, spanish guitar and layered writing and production put this work on the top scale of Top 40 70s pop.James Gurrcio's production is even tighter here. He is smart enough to seperate the pop from the jazz, and this worked better when this was a doulbe LP set. The genre leaping that marred some of those early Chicago double sets is cut away here, leaving this a tight, coharent yet diverse album--probably Chicago's last stab at early 1970s progressiveism before they became a singles unit."
1,It's just a puzzle... don't expect to make any music with it.,"We received this as a gift, for my son's first birthday because the giver knew that he liked music. I understand it's out of his age range, but even his 33 year old mother (me) could not play the songs on the music sheet included because the puzzle sometimes makes the sound, and sometimes it doesn't and it requires skilled movements to have them going at any kind of speed. So, don't buy it for the music, but you can buy it for the sound. The chiming sound was pleasant and not electronic but there is no volume control or off-switch so beware - as a previous reviewer note, it can also go off on it's own."
4,Must listen to the entire songs,"Any longtime XTC fan knows that you have to listen to the full track to or you miss something. With Mummer I found some tracks where I wasn't impressed but as I continued listening a *sweet jewel* was hidden and became revealed. If you love XTC you want this in your collection. I liked it better than Skylarking, but I'm also going to give that one another try.Beating of Hearts has beautiful lyrics.Wonderland is captivating.Love on a Farmboy's Wages is my favorite tune on the CD.Deliver Us From The Elements is frantically good.Procession Towards Learning Land is hauntingly good."
4,An underrated and essential XTC-Album,"Don't miss this record! Although it may not be an album as spectacular as the precending ""English Settlement""(1982) and the following ""Big Express""(1984), it offers proves of Andy Partridge's great songwriting skills (plus two interesting tunes by Colin Moulding) and an astounding stylistic diversity. A short overview: The acoustic guitar driven/cleverly arranged ""Love On A Farmboy's Wages"" and ""Me And The Wind""; the Beatles-influenced ""Great Fire""; exercises in synthie-pop (""Wonderland""); Dub at the end of ""Human Alchemy""; instrumentals that aren't afraid of dissonances (""Procession Towards Learning Land"" and finally an attack on music-industry which is as apt as fiteen years ago."
5,Lots of Power,"Seems to spin my drill faster and with more power than the original batteries. Haven't used the tools much since installing it, but I expect it to be a good product. Found a way to kick start my old batteries, so may not need another, now having three to swap between."
5,Ryobi keeps going...,"I have had this battery for 6 weeks now, and have only needed to charge it one time since the intitial charge. I use my drill once or twice daily for short periods of time on various projects in my shop. The battery seems to be doing what it is supposed to do."
1,Ryobi replacement battery,"I have not seen it let alone use it! One month after ordering the battery it has not arrived! As of this moment, I'm pretty disgusted with the whole process. This is the first time ever that I have ordered something, paid for it and have NOT received the item."
1,Worst Possible Book on Mormonism,"This author purports to be a Mormon, but writes without any authority on the faith. Her writings elsewhere have been gross misrepresentations of the faith. She has no authority from the Church to speak for them, either. If you genuinely want to understand Mormonism, there are good books available. This is NOT one of them!"
5,Helpful to our relocation to Salt Lake City,"We recently were relocated through my husbands employer to Salt Lake City. And I'd known a few mormons. However, I was warned it was ""different"" down there in Utah. SO I got this book to help me understand a bit. Glad I did. For basic information, this book seems to be very informative. It doesn't have everything (how can it?) The glossary of terms was great. Whenever we'd hear something, we'd immediately look it up. They have a section in there about how a typical Sunday service is held - information which was of no use to us. There is a lot of the history of the religon.If you're moving to SLC, this is an indispensible tool."
4,Study of the tenets of the Latter Day Saints Church,"My ancestors on my maternal grandmother's side joined the LDS church in the 1800's in Ohio, they followed the church to Nauvoo in Illinois on to Missouri and finally to Salt Lake City, Utah. Family lore has it that my great....etc grandparents lived on the same street as Brigham Young. When he pushed them to join into a plural marriage situation, they rebelled. My grandfather left to join a wagon train to California. In the middle of the night, my grandmother with her 5 month son and her 7 year old daughter, left to join him. My grandmother had never driven a wagon.I have always been curious about the tenets of the LDS church and what would drive anyone to accept plural marriage as a norm. I wanted a quick way to answer my questions and this book has served that purpose. I think I now understand what motivated the church to promoted this condition. This book has also probed me into trying to trace my ancestry."
3,War Story,Story was more about what an officer in the us army was not suppose to do and things he did was was not very professional
5,A KEEPER!,WAR STORY by Jim Morris is one of those books you have to have in your collection of war stories. Toss out one of mine or somebody else's because with Morris you get quite simply one of the finest books on the war in Vietnam there is! ... I'm so ... jealous I even stole a few of his verbs!
2,Disjointed,"From a literary standpoint, War Story is very disjointed and rambling. Side bars are frequent and often pointless. The book starts out with the author arriving in Nam for his second tour, then goes into a flashback of the first tour that lasts a third of the book, without telling what's going on. There are very few dates and no maps. There is not near as much action as most of the popular Viet Nam books, and the story is largely one of the author's frustration at not being allowed to command a combat team for more than a couple operations. The book may be of value for its unique content about Montagnard advisors before regular troops arrived, and the author certainly speaks from the heart."
3,Good Story,"Author seemed sincere, not full of himself by any means. A very nice job in describing his combat experiences, and in describing what it was like being in that conflict. I thought too much detail on the Tet Offensive."
5,I agree with Jack Singlaub,"This is THE book to read if you were never involved with Special Forces and wonder what it is like to be in SF. This is also the book to read if you WERE in SF in SE Asia and you find it hard to find books that relate people and events in a meaningful way to your own experiences, a clearer perspective than when we lived them. Besides all that, War Story a great read. Like candy or whatever you like best, a real treat page turner."
2,Boring,I found the book to be a boring read. Not much action experience by the author. It was just very boring and I couldn't wait to finish reading it so that I could read another book.
2,A Detailed Chronology with Little Analysis,"Bill Quandt's volume on the American role in the Middle East peace process reads more as a chronology of events than a real analytical piece of history. The author devotes an extradinary amount of detail to minor events and actions without really explaining the motives of the players behind the actions. The strongest part of the book is the Presidential Crisis decision making model, in which he explains how he feels US policy on the issue is molded. There is little to judge against, however, since the author does not really do justice to the other theories of US decisionmaking on the middle east. Whether or not he agrees with them, he could at least tell us why he thinks they are incorrect. And finally, the amount of minutia the author goes into ends up leaving the reader wishing he would just decide to highlight a few important events and motives."
5,"Modern day Paul as story, from wife and husband team","Each of their books are Only $1 ... are you up to reading about a Starving, Tortured, Forgiving ... Christians that proceeded with an underground Church even at the risk of YEARS of Prison... AGAIN.. must read, for our Faith is Nothing compared to One day in their shoes.BLESSINGS"
3,It's Okay,"I don't think it smells that much like honeysuckle, but everything smells different when it's on fire.... >:) Hee hee..... Anyway, if you need a good scent to clear the room about once a week like I do, this will work for you, if you're willing to pay that much for it."
4,The Birth of Postmodernism,"With ""Tristram Shandy,"" Sterne invented postmodernism 200 years before it supposedly was initiated by the likes Joyce, Burroughs and Pynchon. The book is hilarious. It is supposed to be the life and opinions of the narrator. Instead, it takes about fourhundred pages to even get to when he was born. The book radically changes tone in the last hundred pages (as, I think, Sterne was nearing death), and the then present day Shandy is finally presented. Some of these scenes are touching, but the final chapters become redundant. The book is completely inconsistent, the narrator interrupts at all possible times ... But it works! Read this book, but be advised to possibly skim the last fifty pages."
5,Essential,"This is a wonderful book and any humanist who doesn't mind 18th-century English should read it. I feel a love and affection for Uncle Toby, and certain other characters from here, beyond anything I can muster for characters from any other book. And Sterne is funny! Expect bawdy humor and anarchistic fun with narrative structure. Sterne will teach you to read."
1,Do Not Buy!,"This may a portion of the book, but I found out that it is not the whole thing. There are many additional volumes which the class I bought this for requires that I read. If you are required to read this for a class, find another addition. I ended up purchasing the modern library edition, which is complete."
2,You wouldn't want to share a carriage with this fellow,"I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation. Yes, there are moments of great wit. However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book. It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing. It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree. Certainly a unique achievement, I guess. But so is Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music."""
2,"Left me Flat, better things out there","Having read a fair amount of 17th and 18th century European literature I looked forward to another good experience. Unfortunately Trisham Shandy did not live up to its reputation. Reading others review I saw words like Comical, Capricious and Deceptively Frivolous. I could find only a few pages out of the 500 that would justify these high praises. I found the book to start out slowly and then fizzle out altogether.My advice to those thinking of reading this book is to make sure that you have read all of the Voltaire and Swift that you can lay your hands on and then think of this one again."
2,It may be famous but its not worth struggling through,"Having tried so hard to finish this I have become convinced that its reputation comes from people who have, somehow, managed to read it and didn't want to feel all the effort was for nought. It really isn't all that good either as satire or entertainment. Swift or Fielding are infinitely superior. I have met others who, after a few drinks, were willing to admit that they too couldn't read this balderdash. The only person I know who claims to have read and enjoyed it had, on closer questioning, no idea what it was about."
2,"Husband likes it, guess that is what matters",boring . Please don't make us write all these words. It keeps you from getting reviews. I cannot spend this much time.
1,Over-rated,"Tristram Shandy is a self-indulgent, pretentious mess. Laurence Sterne seems more concerned with his erudition than with telling his story. The novel is a sort of intellectual tease, as Sterne intorduces storylines, and then announces that he will complete the storyline later so that he can digress onto some topic that may have been of interest in 1760 (such as the description of fortifications) but which is of little interest today. By doing this, Sterne builds up and then frustrates our expectations, revealing Sterne as both vain in his self-indulgence and disrespectful to his gentle readers. One would need to be a classicist to understand the classical references littered throughout the book. Sterne could have told a story; instead he gave a lecture."
1,Kindle is not whole,"If you need this book for class, I suggest you buy it. The free Kindle version is only the first four volumes. Amazon should be more clear"
5,Great Find!,"Peter Barker is a marvelous reader, and Sterne is a wild man writer.Something to be savored and smiled at over time. Many times a laugh aloud!Don't be in a hurry, or you'll miss mosst of the fun."
4,"Good CD, needs more breakdowns","The other reviewer said it best ""this CD is not very breakdown heavy and that is something I look for in a ""hardcore"" band"". I couldn't agree more, this CD is very good and very intense but if they just threw in more breakdowns this CD would get the five stars. This sounds like a lot of metalcore but with such few breakdowns in the music, the songs start to blend together and get monotonous. Word of advice to Misery Signals: throw more breakdowns into your next CD, your fans will appreciate it. Anyone who is a big fan of Misery Signals, I recommend checking out On Broken Wings, a far superior band in my opinion."
4,good stuff...,"When i first heard ""The Year Summer Ended in June"" i loved it after the first time i heard it...The other songs are good too...but not the best this year, but good;D"
3,These guys are so much better live,"These guys are absolutely amazing live. The CD, however, drags. At times it's down right boring. They're very talented, but it seems as if they were reluctant to show it when recording this album. While listening, I can't help but to talk to the CD player. 'Come on spit it out kid.' Yeah there's a slight issue with elongating and repeating words, and taking way too long spit out the line. Every band has its flaw, right? So it's a bit forgivable considering they're still new in the game. You can expect good things from this band.As far as the band goes: absolutely amazing. If you get a chance to check out one of their shows do it without hesitation. For the CD: It definately could be better considering who it's coming from. None the less a note worthy effort.The best songs on this album are A Victim, A Target and Five Years."
3,Good but not great,"This band has got a lot of hype, and i dont really see why.The Year Summer Ended in June and Five Years are the best tracks on here.Personally, the vocals are the worst bit for me, i cant really dig them, plus its a bit too metal for my taste, but then again, it is produced by that \M/ freak Devin Townsend.If you like stuff like KsE , Unearth, and similar sounding stuff, youll probably like this."
5,Good for elementary teachers,"I originally ordered this because my girlfriend is working on being an elementary teacher, it contains 3 of the bug based magic schoolbus episodes (didn't realize this, I don't know much about the magic school bus). Great thing to buy if you're trying to find some DVDs for an elementary school room."
5,Magic School Bus,Your kids will love all of the Magic School Bus videos. They are all educational and perfect for approximately 4 year old and up. You'll be amazed at the things your kids will learn from these fun videos!
4,Not my favorite tracklisting from Mariah but,"well worth getting! I didn't care for the tracklisting because there wasnt much new material so I decided to get the UK version. However, the remix and the origonal are absolutly incredible! So, if u aren't picky like me then get it! Her voice is in excellent shape and Joe and 98* add a whole level of vocals to it!"
5,An Incredible Remix!!!,"I have loved Keith Sweat's ""Make it Last Forever"" for years now, so when I discovered that Mariah Carey had done a remix version of ""Thank God I Found You"" with ""Make it Last Forever,"" I was very excited! I'm not the biggest fan of the original version of ""Thank God I Found You,"" so I must say that the remixed version is very refreshing and just all-round good. Joe and Nas did excellent jobs on the song. It's just cool to see how Mariah could take one song and totally change it around and make it something not only new, but much better than the original! I would highly suggest this CD to anyone who wants to hear an incredible song!"
1,A Natural Disaster,"I remember one time this song (featuring Joe) was being played on the radio and after the song was over the DJ said, ""Now that's what I call a natural disaster!"" Then he chuckled and said, ""I was just playing! It's a good song!"" That DJ knows darn well he wasn't playing because I and other people even thought this song was a ""natural disaster"". Mariah was just better off doing a remake of ""Make it Last Forever."" Skip this at all cost. . . Oops! I just realized everyone has forgotten all about this song already. Never mind!"
1,stretch belt,this belt does not stretch... the seller responded by sending a belt that did stretch. Also this belt is not attractive at all. Just a dark brown bla....
1,Awful! Don't waist your money,This piece of junk stopped working after two times. Don't bother ordering this because you'll regret it. Hindsight is 20/20.
2,"Would rate 5 if it wasn't edited. Missing ""Kill the President""","The Offspring's Debut album was a seminal punk album, possibly one of their best and one of the genre's best. But they removed Kill the President. That's censorship, and it's BS. A work of art isn't complete if you remove 1/12th of it, and it was one of the best songs on the album.It's a time capsule of 1988/1989, and should be taken in context. I'm a conservative republican and I think the fact that they removed that song is absurd. You can't change history, and you can't censor art.You also shouldn't advertise this album as being an original reissue when it isn't. The original had one more song than this, this is incomplete.I was very disappointed when I got this CD to replace an old copy and it was missing Kill the President for obviously ridiculous reasons."
3,"Does not have ""Kill the President""","I love the Offspring and this album. However you must beware that the song ""Kill the President"" is NOT on the album. I basically only bought the album for that song."
4,"The Offsring (self-titled) - a little crude, but good","First off, although Amazon listed the song, ""Kill the President,"" on the CD, I was sent a CD which did not have that song. I'm not complaining; I just wanted to make that clear to anyone reading this.As for the CD itself, this is some good ""horror punk,"" with some songs reminiscent of The Misfits. Fans of ""Ignition,"" and maybe ""Smash"" will most likely enjoy this music. Of course, this is nothing like ""Pretty Fly,"" though. It is very raw - musically as well as quality-wise. Key songs are ""Elders,"" ""Crossroads,"" ""Beheaded,"" and ""Tehran."""
3,"Maybe Not As Good As Other Albums By Them,But Worth-While","In My Opinion This Is A Decent Release,But I Couldn't Give It As Good A Rating As There Other Albums As I Prefer Them But I Have Found That The More I Listen To It The Better It Sounds And I Think Its A Great Debut Release For A Band(Original Release 1989)."
2,Not the same,The style of music from Offspring(self titled) is nothing like the music from their latest four cd's. It's more like hate music and much less fun to listen to than the others.
5,The best Offspring CD by far,"How can you guys say this CD sucks? This is by far the best of all the Offspring releases. This CD was released back in the 80's when Dexter and the band were into groups like T.S.O.L. That is where the darker influences in the music come from. Of course most of you probably have never heard of T.S.O.L. and other good punk bands from the 70's and 80's. So...Do yourself a favor and check out bands like Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, The Descendents, Minor Threat, Circle Jerks, The Misfits, The Clash, or anything else from that era. If you claim to like punk music and you listen to stuff like the Offspring's Americana you'll be kicking yourself when you realize how stupid you were."
5,best cd ever!,"even though this is their first, it's their best!i don't know why they still don't play punk like that anymore.if your a hardcore offspring fan like me, you should see them live. they sound better live than they do on their cd's!. the best song on this cd is beheaded, but all the other songs are great too."
5,Best CD,"This is the BEST Offspring CD to date...Songs such as Blackball, and I'll be Waiting deliver such great sound, and Dexter's unique voice just adds to the greatness of the CD. Every single song on this CD is great and doesn't dissapoint you! I highly recommend it :) Offspring has been one of my fav bands since Ignition, if you are looking for TRUE Offspring music, buy this CD! :)"
3,A solid debut album from a legendary band,"Although it is nothing like Americana, Conspiracy of One, or Splinter, this is well worth picking up if you are a fan of The Offspring. With songs like Jennifer Lost the War, Beheaded, Demons, and Kill the President, this is a much darker album than any other Offspring CD. If you liked Smash and/or Ignition better than the more recent Offspring albums then you'd probably like this one. If you're a bigger fan of the pop/rock style of more recent albums then you may want to preview the tracks first.Best Tracks:Jennifer Lost the WarCrossroadsBlackballI'll Be Waiting"
1,DO URSELF A FAVOR AND DONT BUY,offspring is an awesome punk band...and any true fan should really explore the bands earlier work but unfortunately it isn't the case with offspring.....this album is a rip off ur money and a total waste of time....don't buy it even if u liked the rest of the albums...if u dont have one of the other 5 get one of those...not this piece of manure...its not worth it. i am very dissapointed about this cd...but i pretend it doesn't exist..:)
1,Amateurish disappointment on a major league level,"This book was scrapped together with content almost totally downloaded from software makers' web sites. Not even edited together in any coherent fashion. The same topics were treated multiple times in numerous places. Mr. Roman may be knowlegable about PDF workflow, but it doesn't show in this overpriced, over-rushed, overly-complex and already out-of-date book."
3,First SRK disappointment.,"I purchased this movie w/high expectations because I thoroughly enjoy SRK films. But this one was just alright for me. It was very silly,-not very funny-But I think of it as a SRK stepping stone to becoming a Great Actor."
2,Waste of time.,"Labored reading, unable to relate to the author or the story. I just don't like the way she writes a story."
2,Not her best,"As one who loves Virginia Woolf's works, this collection was disappointing. Short stories are definitely not her genre. I will keep to reading her novels."
4,"Use this book as a reference, not an introduction","I bought this book as my first C++ book two years ago. Believe me or not, with my solid C backgroud, I felt quite hard reading through the book chapter by chapter. It focuses on inside and out of C++, not a whole lot of OOD concept for a procedure-oriented software developer. Two years later, I am now continuing to explore the C++ world. It makes more sense to me ever than before.Overall speaking, the pro for this book is that it pretty much covers bolts and nuts of C++; the con is that its sample codes are somewhat cubersome. I would rate it as a reference for experienced readers, not for some novices."
5,Awesome Book Cuts Reading Time in Half!!,"If you have one of those large texts that you have to read and just dont have the time- this is the perfect middle man! It cuts to the chase- gives you all you need to know in relation to the facts- I read my big text for the nursing know how's for how to care for the new mom- but this is great to get just what you need to know for the tests! I love this book- in fact all of the straight a's books are great as well- my teacher in fact wanted to use this book as the actual text, she liked it so much. Really a great investment- This was a great read too- not boring like some other texts- kept me very interested!"
5,Maternal-Neonatal,If your looking for ways to improve your grades in maternal-neonatal nursing this is an excellent source. Your grade will improve after reading this book. For me i found it helpful in passing my exams with higher grades. It comes with a CD for more practice in answering question. I would recommend this book for grade improvement and easy to understand course material. Many of the question will come up on school exams as well as your nclex exams.
2,Look elsewhere if you are a developer!,"I've bought other IDG books and have been TOTALLY impressed so I tried this book. I've also bought several developer books for previous Access versions by other authors/publishers. I haven't spent a lot of time in this book, but some basic things like a discussion of MSDE vs Jet seem to be missing (or at least not in the index). MSDE (SQL 7 Lite) seems to be an important new ""developer"" development and is completely missing from the book. Even the Que ""Using Access 2000"" covered this topic. Buy something else."
3,The good the bad and the ugly....,"The good...Wetton's voice is wonderful by any measured standard, and, he is in good voice on this recording. His reading of the pieces is spot on. He is so good in fact that he ""almost"" obliterates the technical concerns of the CD.The bad...The guitar work is redundant and even annoying at times. It gets in the way of some of the finer pieces on the CD. The recording is borderline acceptable (see the ugly).The ugly...The first time I heard this CD it sounded like it was mixed through one of my cheap junior high school guitar amps with bad reverb. It has a very hollow sound, like it was recorded from a bad seat in the arena. The hollow sound affects the guitar on some of the cuts and gives it a terrible TWANG sound. The fact that the same note that goes TWANG is hit over and over again throughout the CD doesn't help it.This is NOT an amazing recording, at least not given the history of Wetton's work. He has put out far better."
5,Space Ghost is a hit!!!!,"We LOVE Space Ghost. It's old, i know, and I was surprised to find it for SOOOOO affordable!!!!!! I looked at stores and it was 5 times the price! luckily i looked on Amazon. I found it, and got it less than a week later! my boys quote it and love it. it was NEW!!!!! no scratches or ripped packaging. VERY GOOD SERVICE! Will shop with you again when i need more movies!thanks you and I would definitely recommend you."
5,Pure bliss,"""Ciao, Baby"" is excellent. It's a very ""dance-y"" album, but some of the lyrics are much darker than the music would have you believe. It's closest in style to their first album, ""Shakedown!"".As for comparisons to Gwen...Gwen's solo music is fluff, THIS has substance.""Just A Fantasy,"" ""Fix,"" and ""Wartime"" are my favorite tracks, but all of them are strong--I haven't found any that I want to skip past.Aimee is a master with lyrics--you'll find yourself wanting to write some of the lines down and remember them. The vocals are sultry. And what's really impressive about this album is that Jamie did all the instruments himself, and flawlessly.Trust me, this cd is worth it for the album art alone..."
5,An amazing addition to thestart's discography,"First, theStart is an amazing band. I own every album of theirs and love each one. Needless to say, I certainly had high expectations for this album.I was not disappointed. My favorite song so far is Millionaire. The sound of this album is not as guitar heavy as Shakedown and Initiation. It experiments with different sounds and is more closely aligned with their self-proclaimed ""dance music from the future"" description. All in all, absolutely amazing."
2,I'm so depressed,"I've been a fan of theSTART since I saw them open for Incubus back in 2001. I love everything they have done, and consider Initiation to be one of their strongest albums. I liked the fact that they tried a different, darker approach to their sound; it worked with Initiation. This album, though, is just flat out dissapointing. It sounds like one of two things happened:1. Aimee has become theSTART's equivalent of Gwen Stefani and spent too much time listening to No Doubt's Rock Steady album.2. The band wanted to try something new/different and this is the unfortunate result.I'm personally hoping that the latter is the true scenario, but I judging by the cover, I wouldn't totally dismiss the former. I sincerely hope this is a one-time fluke. I've seen them everytime they come to San Antonio/Austin (which puts me at 8 shows now), but I don't even know if I want to see them perform this stuff."
1,Waaaaaaaaaaaay Ooooooooooverated.,"I'm into the heavier metal stuff that is usually about death and destruction but every so often i just want to listen to music that is still heavy but doesn't take it self so seriously and is about having fun. That combined with the fact that Revolver magazine voted this CD the best Cd of 2005 made me think hey I'll give it a shot. Well I couldn't have been more wrong. First off the song ""the new black"" isn't that bad it gets my head nodding a little bit but the rest of the cd is just spazzcore riffs that don't go anywhere(unlike the red chord)and the singer sings in exactly the same annoying tone for the ENTIRE cd. That's the bad new the good news is I found the band i was looking for thank god for Municipal Waste!"
5,Awesome,"ETID has put out another insane album. While this one is a lot different than their previous releases, its not worse in any way. Some people think they've sold out (I guess because of the singing?), but I think thats pretty far from the truth. The thing is ETID has stayed true to form (unlike Hot Topic drag queen sellouts Eighteen Visions). Even though there is some catchy singing, there's also plenty of breakdowns and unorthodox time signatures which we've come to expect from them. 5 out of 5. Definately worth buying."
5,Bring on the Southern Rock!,"Every Time I Die's new album is a lot different than their past releases, which is a good thing. I love their other stuff, but this album mixes their trademark chaos/noise with some southern rock sensibilities....look for guest appearances from gerard from my chemical romance and daryl from glassjaw."
5,Pixel Perfect,"The best survey of ""interesting and inspiring"" websites period. I'm going to be giving it to friends who are desigers for their birthdays this year. It shows sites which are pushing technology, not being pushed by it. However, this book may make working at a large .com more difficult for a designer.Be warned."
1,This book is horrible,"I can find only one use for this book. It is an excellent example of what NOT to do when designing user interfaces. These are some of the most unusable interfaces I have seen to date.Also, the only skill of the designers display is their ability to over use popular, gimmicky, current design trends. There is no originality displayed in the designs and there is no forethought in UI design and layout."
3,Adidas OK,These sneakers are good for Standing for long amounts of time and for walking but I would not suggest them for running. They feel like they do not have enough cushion or support near the toe of the shoe.
4,Good but Oates has done better,"It was Virginia Woolf who decried the lack of literature about the lives of the masses, the everyday folk: ""All these infinitely obscure lives remain to be recorded,"" she said. Of course, she didn't promise to read them!In MARYA, A LIFE, Oates attempts to fill that void. Marya is a portrait of a modern woman from a bewildered childhood to a womanhood that commands admiration, respect and love. She is a loner, bright and different from the people around her. She strives for self understanding and fulfillment.Joyce Carol Oates is a meticulous storyteller and a vivid writer. I wonder if this is autobiographical. If so, the Woolf reference becomes irrelevant. Oates is definitely ordinary folk -- she is one of the finest and most recognized writers on the contemporary American literary scene.But if you're in the mood for a book about a woman growing up and ""making it"" on her own, you'll enjoy this one.Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)"
5,"Great book, so-so edition","Our book club chose ""Marya: a Life,"" so I came to it with no foreknowledge. (The only Oates I had read was her stunning short story, ""Where Are You Going Where Have You Been."") I found ""Marya"" far better than most of its recent reviews indicate. It is a tough-minded, beautifully-written look at the early years of a writer who has risen from mean beginnings to find success in the world. It is a far stonger book, in my mind, than book club favorites such as ""Liar's Club"" or ""The Glass Castle,"" both of which are good books in their own rights.That said, the paperback edition was a huge disappointment -- it was poorly typeset/printed, to the point where it was unpleasant to read. Fortunately, several Amazon sellers had used hardback copies. I recommend that route should you chose to read this excellent coming-of-age book."
2,Poor Customer Service,"The batteries work as expected. Batteries.com is an online business to avoid. They sent me different batteries than I ordered, charged exorbitant shipping fees, and then made it very difficult to get the batteries replaced when they messed up the order in the first place. Two thumbs down!"
1,Awful,O'Reilly should really offer refunds on this book. It is unreadable.Buy Martin Fowler's UML Distilled instead.
1,Not for beginners,"This is NOT the book you want if you are just starting to learn about UML. I bought it for that purpose, and found it useless.I'm selling it now, and will use the proceeds toward Martin Fowler's book, UML Distilled."
1,Not very useful,"This book is aptly named. Like most nutshells, it is all but indigestible. A much better overview of UML is Martin Fowler's ""UML Distilled""."
3,Different kind of effort,"I have bought the book a few months back and I am not fully through. As a software professional and teacher, I think this is a different kind of effort. I have got an Indian edition of the book and low-priced editions of both the UML user's guide and reference guide by the Three Amigoes are also available in India. I do not think this book can pose any competition to the Three Amigoes' books. But as a short and quick reference it should serve some purpose.The numerous errors however should not be ignored. O'Reilly or no O'Reilly, I really do not think that any good book should contain so many errors. The errata, which I found in O'Reilly's site however, is a good compensatory effort."
1,Ugh!!,"I completely (totally) concur (agree) with the other reviewer's assessment (review) of the book in listed on this page. If you find this style of writing annoying (aggravating) then you will not enjoy (like or appreciate) this book. The repetitive style and obtuse diction make this book unbearable. Don't even try to make sense out of the diagrams. I shall request a return of funds upon surrendering this item. I'm getting my money back.What happened here, O'Reilly?"
1,One star is too flattering for this book - YAWNnnn,"What can I add to the remarks made by all the other one-star reviewers? Not a lot. I could bullet-point all their comments. This would give prospective purchasers a glimpse of what they are letting themselves in for. Like some of the other reviewers, I have come to regard O'Reilly's Nutshell series as a quality source of information. This book provides a sharp lesson in taking things for granted. NEVER AGAIN. I can only console myself with the thought that the bookwas not too expensive a mistake."
1,Not an O'Reilly type of book!,"I was gonna buy this book until I got hold of my co-employee's copy. This book is so BORING that I gave up reading it after 2 chapters! I would usually have a quick glance at all the pages of a book to get rough idea on what the book is all about. But this time, I came up with nothing. The presentation style is so AWFUL it doesn't matter anymore what's inside the book!"
1,Poor Contents,Regrettably this is one of my books in UML (just because it is from Oreilly). A piece of advice to the author: take some time to strengthen your UML background -- playing around with words is the not the way to write a book.
2,"bad examples, no narrative","I was expecting a whole lot more. The examples are contrived and not very interesting. The prose consists of lists and lists.I remember picking up the first edition of Java in a Nutshell and basically figuring out the whole language from reading the first 40 pages. That is what I was expecting here and it did NOT deliver.I would return it if I could. As it is, I am trying to select a UML text for a course I am teaching, and I was hoping I had found an inexpensive choice that the students would be able to use as a reference, while giving a reasonable explanation of the basics of UML. Wrong."
3,A theoretical view on the UML,"If you need a book to start everyday usage of the UML - this is a wrong book (almost no examples). If you are looking for a reference book - it is not the case, with the exception of OCL chapter and to the some extent the language extensions chapter.If you are interested in a kind of theoretically-abstract view on the UML, if you are not afraid of heavy style - than buy it.To understand the content and especially the diagrams you ought to apply unusually great efforts - and may be that is in a special way rewarding.I personally after going through the book feel ready to descend from abstract pinnacles to the practical ground (to use some how-to-make-it work manual) and feel that the difficult journey was useful."
2,'ok' at best,"The tutorial section was ok, but other than that I found the book to be of little use. The author's attempt at describing the basic O-O paradigm is possibly the most convoluted explanation I've ever seen. Eg, object operations (aka methods) ""Are representational constructs of behaviorial characteristics of entities"". IMO, this is just one example of many failed attempts at describing simple concepts. I started to wonder if the author was paid by the syllable."
2,A misleading book title,"As some readers already mentioned, it is not a book for someone who wants to learn UML. The introduction example is quite helpful but afterwards it is just full of ""PowerPoint""-slide-style (PPSS) description."
1,NEXT!,"`UML in a nutshell' is a book I do not like. The terminology used deviates from what is commonly used in all other books on the subject. I disagree with the sequence in which the author presents the material and find his introduction to OO one of the worst ones I have ever come across. Trying to capture all of the UML in such a small book resulted in the book containing information that is only mentioned and not explored, leaving the reader confused rather than enthused. Finally, what does not help at all is the heavy use of bullet points throughout the book, which is a characteristic of the bad style this book is written in. I apologise to the author, maybe he is brilliant at what he does for a living (one never knows), but a technical writer he is not. END"
2,Ouch!,"I bought this book, without reading any reviews, on the basis it would demonstrate the usual lucidity of the ""In a Nutshell"" series. Alas no. It is a fine example of a pedantic, overly qualified academic book; almost comical in its lack of clarity. Vague diagrams followed by long lists of overly precise bullet points are the preferred mechanism of imparting knowledge (one can imagine the author sweating to impart maximum exactitude in the minimum word count). I'm sure the author knows the subject, however, I would defy any generalist to make head or tail of it. The last book I read as staggeringly incomprehensible as this was Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus - and at least you know with Wittgenstein it's going to be incomprehensible before you part with your cash. So in a nutshell, no."
1,Not a good book,"This book is horrible. It tries to be a tutorial, and a reference but succeeds at neither. Instead we get a dense book consisting mostly of bullet points, complicated diagrams and a rambling format which never gets to the point or tells you concisely what you want to know. It is like someone has just cut and pasted the bullet points of their UML training course (extra complicated edition) into book format.I don't suppose UML is *that* hard to understand assuming an author takes you through it in reasonable learning steps, but unfortunately this book doesn't.This is a very poor O'Reilly title."
1,This book is a waste of time and money,"I found no use for this book, except as ... The text is boring. There is no explanation, just a set of phrases that most of the time seams to be lost in the context. From chapter one to three there is nothing useful. Some diagrams and descriptions after Chapter 3 but everything is to much vague. For me this is more a review or collection of white papers than a book."
3,A good start for a promising book,"I use this book in my master course on consultancy at our university. It provides an accessible and critical description of what the consulting business presently looks like and what its future may hold. I use this book to complement the more classical academic articles and books students are expected to read on organizational change and consultancy. As such it provdes great added value. One major drawback is, that the authors are so involved in the industry that they sometimes assume too much inside knowledge (terminology, trends) from readers that are relative outsiders. Thus, the book could do with another harsh round of editing by a non-industry expert. The same goes for a number of figures and classifications in the book that seem somewhat immature, are intuitively hard to grasp and deserve much more explanation and elaboration. Again, more editing is needed."
5,Very Effective book,This is a great book to help teachers develop and present a peace curriculum which is enjoyable and effective for children as young as 3.5 years and older. Many teachers in our school are very happy working with this book.
2,And more songs missing,"I came to see the songs on this soundtrack and found out that the songs I liked to listen are not present. There are a couple of traditional Peruvian songs that run throughout the movie. It's a shame, because they are quite present in the film. Anyway, I got the name of them, just in case anybody is interested. They are ""Vienen bajando las llamitas"" (The little llamas are coming down), by Uña Ramos, and ""Alborozo Kolla"" (Kolla Joy), by Andes Folk Group. There are also some Ali Farka Toure's songs missing. What a pity."
1,Other missing songs,Also missing is George Michael's Freedom which is heard not once but twice in the movie. There are several others featured in the film which do not appear on the soundtrack. Lame.
1,Native New Yorker missing :(,it looks like alot of songs are missing....Native New Yorker...too. Like buying soundtracks as you get a great compilation of songs...not here though.
1,A terrible sequel to a great game...,"In 1993, an action game for the original Game boy was released. It was called ""Titus the Fox"". This is the sequel (even though you can't find the original here at Amazon.com). There's still those horrible white lines around everything, making the graphics look like cardboard (or paper) cut-outs. But this game isn't the worst game in the history of earth, because Klonoa: Empire of Dreams (a game for the Gameboy Advance) is."
1,"This game [stinks], if you're looking for [junk] you just foundit","well, needless to say I just bought this game a while back, and emediatly I threw it out to the dogs, being that it was barely good enough for the dogs to chew on. After that I proceeded to pelt it with rocks because it was scaring the kids. All I have to say is ""If you're looking for the worst game in the history of earth.......you just found it"" this is franklydongivadam, and I'm out, oh ya, if this game could have gone into negatives, believe me, it would."
1,Double Shafted Badminton Racquet,"I never buy this badminton racquet before. But after read all the review about this product, I wonder what's country made this racquet? Was it made from USA? Can any body let me know?"
3,"Great Chains, need better tighteners",These chains/cables themselves are top of the line and of great quality. The first time I put them on one of the rubber tighteners snapped and I had to send them back to Amazon. Amazon replaced the chains no problem but I can see the tighteners breaking again in the future. It wold be smart to purchase some extra tighteners just in case but they are hard to find. The chains grip great in snow and mud.
3,Just OK.....,"This book was just OK. It is about a girl, Jennifer, who really wants a horse. All she ever wanted was a horse! She is dissapointed on her birthday when she only receives riding lessons and a china horse. Her china horse is special., Really Special. The china horse turns into a real horse, Moonseeker. How will Jennifer be able to hide Moonseeker?"
4,Its Zane Grey at his visual best,"If you are a Zane Grey fan or a first time reader you will enjoy this book. Prose is a bit antiquated for my taste,but still a good page turner and an excellent read into what times were like back in the 1800's and the use of religion to gain power."
4,Recommended,"I'm not much of a ""Western"" reader. But, this was Zane Grey's first book so I thought I'd give it a try. It turned out to be an interesting story. I ""read"" it as a book on tape. The reader of the book on tape was able to change his voice for each character so the result was like a ""radio play"". Very enjoyable!Email:boland7214@aol."
4,classic in the genre,"Originally written in 1912, Zane Grey's most famous book (and his best) is universally considered a classic of the Western genre. That's not to say it is the best western written, or that Grey is the best western writer. The book is pretty good, I rather enjoyed it. There are negatives, one is the way he portrays Mormons, though I'm not sure if it is ""accurate"" since I'm not sure how Mormons acted in the 19th century, but it could be considered offensive. Grey's characters are also weak. They tend to be either stereotypical or one-dimensional. And his dialog is laughable. But Grey shines in his landscape descriptions. Truly a beautiful picture he can paint with words. His stilted dialogue is made up for by his beautiful descriptive passages. The book is also rife with symbols--Grey can work (whether intentional or not) in many levels. It has it's problems, but it is an enjoyable book. Any fan of the Western should read it, and maybe even thoughs who don't visit the genre often."
2,Riders of the Purple Sage was a little tiresome,I had high expectations when I first got Riders of the Purple Sage. It proved to be repetitive & tiresome. I couldn't get through it.I would highly recommend The Cowboy & the Cossack & Lonesome Dove.
3,"I'd mosey on past this one, partn'r....classic or not.","I occasionally enjoy a good western, but how ""Riders of the Purple Sage"" ever got to be considered a western classic is beyond me. Between the sickeningly chivalrous Lassiter, the nave but always-dutiful Jane (and the rest of the set-piece characters), I could easily imagine it was written by Louisa May Alcott or one of the Bronte sisters in their father's attic. This may be worth a try if you've never read Zane Grey before and want to give it a try but I think I'll stick with Jack Schaffer (try ""Monte Walsh""), Louis L'Amour, Larry McMurtry or A.B. Guthrie from now on."
1,Waste of money,We've had this rack for two years and I keep trying to make it work but the shoes slip off of it all of the time.
4,very good,Very pleased with vendor. The book arrived quickly and was in very good shape. I would definitely order from this vendor again.
3,Its a LOUD Puzzle,"We purchased this puzzle for our kids (ages 4 years down to 6 months) and thought it would be cute. It IS cute, but the animal ""noises"" are really loud, and a few (the snake, zebra, parrot) don't really sound real at all...I would save your money on this puzzle and get the musical instruments one instead!"
3,Just Okay,"I read the other reviews about these sound puzzles but I figured I'd still give them a try. The pictures are great, but the sounds are totally weird and are a little scary, the zebra in particular is awful. These puzzles are definitely light sensitive so we found that we couldn't leave them in our sons room b/c as the sun came in and out of the clouds or set for the evening and rose in the morning they would randomly start making all of their lovely animals noises, a little weird. They couldn't make the puzzle so that the corresponding pieces were the only thing that makes the noise activate?? Okay toy, but nothing great."
4,Very Entertaining,The puzzle is very entertaining for a kid who is over one yr old. My Son plays with it often trying to match the animals with other animal toys he has. Only negative is that you can't switch it off and if you loose/misplace one then you have to keep hearing the sound again and again.
2,Good idea but poorly made,"I was excited about this product, I bought this one and the one with the zoo animals sound.First it work, but then it began to work only when it wanted...Sometimes one animal work, sometimes 2, sometimes all of them...But it's unpredictable and really frustrated overall!How do you explain to a 19 month old that the puzzle does'n't work all the time.At the end my daughter was not interested in it at all...Too bad!And also the sound of the animals are not really realistic."
5,Excellent Book on Small Business Server 2003 - Outstanding!!,"I own quite a few books on Microsoft Small Business Server 2003 and this book by Eriq Neale and his co-authors is the ONE that has the most dog eared pages. I bought this book shortly after it came out and look at it Frequently.It has helped me with the current SBS 2003 Servers I manage and given me tips and ideas I had not thought about before. This book covers SBS Server 2003 from installation to completion and just about eveything in between. This includes stuff like how to integrate Macintosh workstations and using Group Policy in an SBS 2003 environment, and much more.If you are ""New"" to Small Business Server or have been using SBS 2003 for a little while, I would suggest you order this book and READ it! It will be worth your money, in my opinion."
3,Mixed Basket,"The further back in the book, the more vanilla it got. I can see why one person wrote that the author was obsessed with the Wizards. (paraphrased)I love the scenarios and best practices in the first part of the book.Later on you wonder why they put in some of the chapters. This book may be a good place to start if you know nothing. I enjoyed much of the book, but I need to buy another book that gets more into the specifics."
2,dissappointing,"I expected a mix of some basic information and new sources or ideas, but there was really nothing new here. This might be a good resource for someone who has never been exposed to any facet of financing a college education or someone who wants to go into a field for which the education can be free, but you won't find anything too useful if you've already made your plans, or taken out loans, completed a FAFSA and researched on-line unless you just need a review or the process."
3,Good information.,"This book contained some very helpful advise, but wasn't as relative to me as I had hoped since my daughter is going to a beauty school and not a four year institution."
2,Not so much,"Hmm, not so helpful for us, and I'm thinking that I could have found this info for free on a web-search. Arrived timely, and in good condition."
3,Just o.k.,My wife and I just took a CPR/AED recertification. I thought it would be good to have a rescue mask in the car. The case is hard to open and instructions are vague. You better have taken the course if you want to use this mask and have strong hands.
4,1st Aid requires CAUTION!,"After having been trained as an Emergency Medical Technician in 1984 I have had numerous occasions to provide medical assistance to injured persons. Step one is check for a response. Step two is insure adequate breathing. In most cases step two requires contact with bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood and/or vomitous. Since the discovery of AIDS you would have to be a fool to provide mouth to mouth resuscitation without the protection provided by a 'mask'. If you know CPR, and you should, you need a mask. It is of no use unless it is with you. This seems to be a good one at a good price. Don't be without one!"
5,great,The service was great it came right on time. The product was just as described in the ad. I would use this service again.
1,:(,I thought these were the greatest ting until i read that tea tree oil is bad for your liver. even in small amounts.
4,Helpful stop- smoking aid,"I bought these for my husband who recently quit smoking. They have really helped, but be aware the cinnamon flavor is VERY strong and he got a couple of irritated spots in his mouth. You have to put them in and out of your mouth and not hold them in one spot for too long. These were recommended by a smoking cessation counselor and my husband really likes them."
5,My son LOVES these!,A girl in my son's college class had these and he came home and HAD to have them! I came right online and purchased two packages for him. He's in heaven! He loves them. They are a little pricey but they go a long way and sometimes you just gotta have something when you want it.
2,NOT as advertised,NOT chew sticks but simply tooth picks so they should definitely change this listing.ThanksErik
5,"World Politicl Map, Executive Style, National Geographic Maps Poster Print 46 x 30",Our daughter wanted a world map for Christmas this year and was very happy to find this under the tree!
3,Puzzle is OK,So I was looking for a puzzle of the NY skyline and I wanted one with the Twin towers in it. As it turns out my options were limited but I ended up liking this one because of all the colors with the fireworks and it was quite large as well. Some of the piece came bent and it was hard at times to put it together because piece that went together didn't fit very well and it wasn't until I go large chunks of it together that they actually started to fit together like they should. Also the variety of the pieces as far as shape goes was lacking. You just get your standard edge pieces with either to holes in the sides or two prongs in the sides (sorry don't know technical terms) and for the inside puzzle pieces it the same...every piece has two holes and two prongs. Also as a side note...I was disappointed that one of the towers didn't have the communications antenna on it...kind of down graded them to just really tall towers instead of THE twin towers.
2,Disappointed,"Bought this product and used it twice with good results. The two times I used it were a few weeks apart as most things I BBQ I do not need a thermometer. Went to use it a third time and it was blank. Turned it off then on, nothing. Took out the original battery and reinstalled it, nothing. Went to the store and bought new batteries (can't just buy one battery any more) and replaced the original, nothing. Very disappointed.I bought this based on the reviews but it seems these things are pretty hit-and-miss. Maybe you'll get one that works, maybe you won't. Strongly recommend against taking a chance."
1,Battery Life,I received the F800 in good order and time. The battery failed within a week after first usning it. I was very careful not to leave the unit on after using to insure battery life. Perhaps something else failed but the results were the same - - - in the garbage can!
4,Great advices.,"Internet books usually have an ""expiry date"", because of the rapid changes. This book holds some timeless advices. It is an excellent guide, although on a general basis. The price is attractive as well!"
3,Woody at Newport,"It's always a pleasure to hear one of Woody's bands. I think we all miss the kind of energy he brought to the ""big band"" ear. From my view, this isn't the best of Woody's bands (the electric bass annoys me for one and the soloists aren't the stellar crowd he's been noteworthy for in the past bands) Even though, mediocre Woody is a whole lot better than no Woody at all.Don"
2,Not much there for older readers,It's a bunch of 1 or 2 page rescue stories written very simplistically. Would be a good book for beginning readers but doesn't have enough substance for older readers to enjoy.
2,A Disappointment,"Was really looking forward to watching this movie since I enjoy Denzel Washington and have noticed that it is played on HBO and Cinemax quite often, but for some reason I was disappointed. Not sure why, but just could not get into the movie. The script did not seem very original and kind of bored me throughout the movie. Maybe because the picture quality on the dvd from early 90's was so poor that it made the movie look too old. Try to see it on one of the high-def HBO or Cinemax channels but otherwise if you skip seeing it don't think your missing much.Peter J. Miller"
2,"STARTS POWERFULLY, BUT FIZZLES LIKE ""OUT OF TIME""","A sure way to ruin an otherwise intriguing thriller is to loosely tie in patches of action as though someone sat and conceived all these sequences and then threw in a story to somehow tie them in.""Ricochet"" had Dezel W, pretty much the sole reason I picked up this movie. And it started with a bang, literally, followed by some superb action right down to the middle of the film.Yet, midway through the whole charade I just forgot to care about all the gory violence, not in the least due to its implausibility. Some scenes with Lithgow's terrifying cameo as the bad guy are even quite menacing and impactful. But at the end one only leaves with a taste of crassy action from cardboard characters in a staid plot.An ignorable number."
4,"Standard, But Engrossing Washington Action Film","Ricochet is a pretty basic action, but it keeps you interested with great performances by Denzel Washington as the besieged hero and John Lithgow (completely over-the-top performance) as the despicable villain.Washington starts off the movie as a beat cop who runs across criminal Lithgow and apprehends him. Next, we flash forward years later where Washington is the DA, having made his career off of the Lithgow bust. And Lithgow escapes from prison, and is ready for revenge...Everyone performs well, even though you have to believe they realized how silly the movie is, but you are able to go with the flow and suspend disbelief enough to enjoy the proceedings. This is just a fun action flick. No need to make it any more than what it is."
4,ANOTHER GREAT ACTION MOVIE,"A MURDERER [JOHN LITHGOW] GETS CAPTURED BY A COP [DENZEL WASHINGTON]. THE MINUTE HE STEPS FOOT IN JAIL, HE SPENDS EVERY MINUTE OF HIS LIFE PLOTTING REVENGE. THIS MOVIE PROVES THAT DENZEL WASHINGTON CAN DO PRETTY GOOD IN ACTION MOVIES. THEN AGAIN, DENZEL CAN DO GOOD IN JUST ABOUT ANY TYPE OF MOVIE. THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY A GOOD MOVIE TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION."
4,Funny and So Perceptive,I still laugh to myself when I think of the bits that came out of this session of his insights and observations on life.
5,NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING,GEORGIE DOES IT AGAIN.THIS MAN NEVER FAILS.BUY THIS DVD AND YOU CAN DIE HAPPY!
1,Disappointed,"Item received was not as described on Amazon. Amazon listing said ""Lures - 1/12 oz - 3/4 oz."" The picture showed about 8 Lures with a cost of $47.00, which had been reduced to $2.95. I placed the order and a 5 days later received only 1 single Lure. This Lure I could have bought at Walmart for about $2.00. I called the company and they blamed Amazon for making a mistake on the listing, but they have done nothing to correct it. I am unhappy and very disappointed with this company."
5,My dog finally stopped having accidents!,"When I saw the title that included House Training Puppies & ADULT Dogs too, I figured I'd make a last-ditch effort to get my two year old dog to finally stop having accidents. I didn't know what I was doing wrong... I was following a food and water schedule, walking him plenty, and still there were accidents on a regular basis.Now that I've read this book and followed the methods, my dog has completely stopped having housebreaking accidents! The main thing that was helpful was reading all of the ""troubleshooting"" tips, which helped me figure out what my dog's confusion was and how to train him.If your dog or puppy is having housebreaking accidents, I highly recommend this book!"
5,Dog Training,Thank you for providing this book - what a wealth of knowledge. We have been working hard on our loveable golden that likes to jump when greeting new faces. It is a tough habit to break. Thank you for your help.
1,Don't bother buying book if you want Indoor Trained Pooch,"I really wanted to give this book zero stars. I'm planning on returning this book. The description is totally misleading because it is so totally negative about anyone even thinking about toilet training a dog to go indoors instead of being walked outside. The book is totally unforgiving about ANY reason what so ever you may have, without exception, in regards to having your dog or puppy relieve him/her-self indoors. It basically states that if you cannot take your dog outdoors, then don't bother getting a dog and get a cat instead. If everyone went by this book, I think there would be alot of poor dogs without homes that now live in apts, handicapped owners, working owners. I'm going to litter train my dog, without any help from this book!"
5,Amazing musical treasure!,"The encounter between both superb players took place on March 29, 1964. And the Hall of Leningrad was the center of the world that historical day. Both Richter and Kogan performed Beethoven until the last days of their lives. This recital captures in all its glorythe emotion, the passion and the fire of L.V.B. with utmost accuracy and feverish Dionysian spirit.The Kreutzer version is after Szigeti and Menuhin is memorable. The Spring in hands of both, shows their flowering art. And the Op. 12 No. 3 is distinctively touching.Dear reader: this is an unrepeatable musical document. Don't miss it."
2,It's not steel,"..at least not the wire I got; it's soft and highly flexible, I'm pretty sure it's aluminum. Doesn't say anything about steel anywhere on the package..will return it."
1,Cancer Causing Chemicals?!,"The description says it's for clotheslines, but the label says it has toxic, cancer causing chemicals and to wash hands after touching - definitely not appropriate to be rubbing against our family's clothes..."
4,He saved the best for last,"One of the better books in the series, with a very valuable message - duty means performing some tasks that are unpleasant, but performing those very tasks can make life better for everyone. Having read them all in sequence, I am almost sad to know this is the last one I can read to my boys.Synopsis - Dorothy and Ozma travel to a remote section of Oz in an attempt to arbitrate between the Skeezers and Flatheads, two fairy races on the verge of war of a fish supply. Both are made captive by the leader of the Skeezers, who has no interest in peace, and are nearly made permanent prisoners when the Skeezers city becomes trapped under a lake. The entire court of Oz comes to their rescue, led by Glinda the Good and the Wizard, and the group learns a valuable lesson about performing one's duty."
5,Great Ending to a Great Series!,This book is a wonderful end to L. Frank Baum's fantastic series. Glinda of Oz is the most exciting and definitely the best book in the series. The book takes you to the strangest areas in Oz and puts our favorite charcters in facinating positions. The book also shows how magical the land truely is. It is a must-have for all Oz fans.
2,Wannabe .... James Taylor,"It sounds like Livingston wants to sound like his brother. Though his voice is similar, he doesn't have the same talent. If you like James Taylor's music.... then buy it. Don't waste your money on Livingston."
5,"Science Diet Puppy Food Small Bites, 20 Lb",I have always raised my Chihuahuas on Puppy Science Diet Small bite from 6 weeks of age on until they are at least a year. The real tiny (toy) Chihuahuas under 2 pounds are kept on this their whold life. They love it and won't eat anything else. It is healthy and I recommend this to any and all dog owners and breeders.
5,Adventure in the Alps,"I first read this book when I was 12 years old and I've read it innumerable times since. It's impossible to put down and more gripping than most mysteries written for adults. Mrs. Byrd and her three children, Oriole, Peregrine, and Mab have just received a mystifiying telegram from the now-missing Professor Byrd. He's disappeared in a remote valley high in the Alps. In his telegram he mentions ""Tce ghosts."" Does he mean Ice ghosts or The ghosts? Mrs. Byrd hurriedly packs her family onto an airplane, and they're off to investigate the mysterious disappearance and the meaning of the telegram. With the help of a local boy, a bumbling folklorist, and an instructor from the nearby climbers' school, the Byrds must solve both mysteries if they ever want to see their father again."
3,catalog of parallels in different mythologies and religions,"Eliade presents an impressive collection of data from the religions and mythologies of an incredible number of different cultures, organized according to recurring themes: sky gods, agricultural goddesses, cycles of death and rebirth, and so on. It is an interesting resource for the student of comparative religion, but seems to lack a coherent interpretive framework. I'm left with unsatisfied curiosity to know what Eliade believed is to be learned from this collection of parallels. Perhaps his other writings provide more interpretation, but this book (although it contains many interesting ""gems"") seems incomplete as a stand-alone volume."
1,Basically Useless,"This product was useless. Once the backplate was attached to the wall and the cables put into place, the plastic cover would not stay in place. The plastic cover was poorly designed and would not fasten securely to the backplate and would pop-off after a few minutes.After talking to their technical support department, it was explained that this product was not intended to ""manage"" more than one or two cables. Seemed like a lot of to do for something that did not work satisfactorily at all. They suggested that I return the product and get the CMK product instead."
3,Only Good if running 3 or 4 cables only!,"I personally bought two wire management kit eventhough I needed 3 more or so, just to test it out. This wire management kit it's only good if you're running 3 or 4 cables that are not too big. I tried running about 6 or 7 cables being that I'm not using HDMI connections and the product is useless because the cover keeps coming off.Thanks,"
2,Doesnt work,"Not sure why but my game doesnt work at all!!! Like most here i am a huge ""command & conquer"" fan and i thought it would be nice to introduce my teenage son to the games that we played. unfortunately he cant play it. i dont want to give the seller a bad review because they dont deserve it but i cant honestly review the quality of the actual game. just another CD sitting in a box right now"
2,Did not work,I'm not sure if the game is too old but I could not get it to play on my windows 7 computer :(
3,Another netbook great!,"I ordered this game hoping it would run on my Asus Eee pc1005HAB and I was not disappointed.While the graphics are a bit dated(okay VERY dated)if you are looking for some RTS on a netbook give this a try.No slowing, freezing or stuttering when I have played this.A great game to kill some time with until your copy of Starcraft 2 arrives.Uh,no SC2 on the netbook although SC1 plays beautifully too.If you own a netbook and like this genre C&C2 is for you!!!"
3,So happy to rediscover Kristy McNichol on DVD!,"I am so happy to rediscover Kristy McNichol on DVD.She is an actress with an undeniable charm and an innate talent. No longer under the spotlight, I sincerely hope she's finally happy...Thank you for all those great movies Ms McNichol!!"
4,The font size is too too too too small,This review is specifically about the Elibron Classics edition of this work. (ISBN 0-543-93159-5) The font is so small that it is almost unreadable. I would seriously recommend buying a different edition. I personally am planning on doing just that.
2,small,This set of lights was much smaller than I expected. I'm not sure if I didn't read the package right or it is just small. They worked fine.
3,They were okay,I ordered two of these but they were not enough to cover the bushes. One of them was broken and had to be returned. I like the concept of the product but as I stated they were not big enough to cover the entire bush. We bought 4 more boxes locally to cover the rest of the bushes. They looked wonderful once they were done.
2,This time it has worse quality,"I purchasesd this last year, 3 pieces, I expended to have another 3 pieces this year, looks like quality issue, 2 of three pieces has problem, 1/4 of the lights does not work on each piece, Do not know if I will buy this next year."
3,Failure Rate not Acceptable,"Each netting is configured in thirds. Within 24 hours one third of a set stopped working. We redistributed the four sets we purchased to cover up the dark section. After Christmas, my husband removed the sets from our hedge and tested them again before putting them away for the season. The second section of the same set was not working. I do not consider a 25% failure rate acceptable for lights that cost this much."
2,Not funny,"Well, I was expecting them too much maybe...today I got my net lights,and could not wait to set 'em up, I still pretested them before to put them onto bushes.Then trouble come.When I plugged them on, I noticed both of them got 1/3 portion not work(they are at the same part),then I kept checking and searching,found out one of them missed a bulb,that's not too difficult,so I added a new bulb on from those backups.But,another one, up to now, I still could not figure out what's happening...All what I could do is to check and check and check by eyes though,I worked on that almost the whole day! Then I was thinking,I might have to buy some light checker for this net light or what?Anyway, they are thoughtful to give some backups though, so I gave two stars."
3,Out of date,The Novell course has been updated and this book no longer contains adequate information. While it may be possible to pass the updated test using this material it is unlikely.
4,A very readable and information packed guide.,"I was amazed at the readability of this book, not like a textbook at all, but still very informative. With very few exceptions, the book covered in sufficient detail everything I encountered on the tests. I would warn readers that they might encounter some questions dealing with Client32 that were not addressed in Clarke's text. The only real complaint I should mention is an obvious lack of editing, which seems to get worse in the latter half of the book. But overall, I am very impressed...the author has an incredible gift for breaking down complex material into a very simple, flowing text."
5,The essential guide to off-roading around Moab,"I used this book to navigate around the back trails near Moab (Arches & Canyonlands National Parks). It was the perfect, unimpeachable companion to driving the 4wd paths.I'll make it short: if you plan to do some recreational offroading in the Moab area of Utah, this is your one and only guide."
5,highly recommend to everyone going to Moab,I have been going to Moab for the last three years and I take this book every time I go. The directions of the trails are right on on and its a easy book to read and describes the trails in detail. If your going to Moab to run the trails this book is a must have in my opinion
4,excellent resource for utah trails,"if you wheel and will be in utah, buy this book.solid info. just wish i could make it out to Moab more often.excellent resource for your wheeling options."
1,POOR POOR COPY (Giant Robot deserves better),"Wow. I wasn't expecting high quality (it is a DVD-R after all), but this is awful!If I'm paying for a movie, why do I have to see a little ""S C"" on the screen. During the opening, the letters ""S C"" appear on the lower right of the screen. Even worse, the letters reappear and stay on the screen for a good part of the movie. These letters are not exactly out of the way either--at times they are actually over the actors themselves. The ""S C"" stands for Sinister Cinema I guess. I'll be sure not to buy any of their products again. Also, the picture shakes vertically at times and is quite bad overall.I assume most people interested in this movie saw it when they were younger and have fond memories of it. It is the story of ""Giant Robot"" and Johnny Sokko, the boy who controls him by speaking into a watch. Even if you're desperate to see this again, look for a better quality version."
2,Not an official release. Home recording.,"Okay, I don't know if this is an illegal copy or not. I suppose it depends on if the film is in public domain or not.Regardless, this was recorded using a Panasonic DVD recorder (I recognize the menu). I assume it's been copied from an old VHS copy.It's watchable, but the quality is comparable to an old, overused VHS tape."
3,below average venom flick,"I have seen many Venom movies & this one rates as one of the worst. First of all you got guns in it. Guns against Kung Fu, who do you think wins that battle. Second of all its too much talking. I had to fast foward half the movie because it got boring. The movie had only one good fighting sequence & that was the end fight. This combined with the acrobatic sequences makes this movie O.K.but thats about it."
2,Uninspiring dragging Venom flick,"While boasting the full complement of Venoms, one of the few they all appear together, the story here is uninspiring and weak. While I'm more than willing to overlook a weak plot if the action is compelling, such is not the case here. The box art heralds that ""there is no shortage of action."" Not only is there a shortage of action, there's a drought of action. The movie drags along at a snail's pace for four-fifths of the movie, then culminates in an extended, longer than most, arguably tedious, final showdown, featuring clever acrobatics and only slightly better than average fighting. This is clearly one of the weaker Venom flicks...BUT if you're an avid Venom fan, you still gotta get it, of course."
5,Excellent version. Get it while it's available,"This is a very enjoyable version of the complete Psalms of David by Heinrich Schütz. The variety of the music is really sort of stunning, especially when one considers how often Schütz employs plainchant throughout these settings.The Regensburger Domspatzen (or ""singing sparrows"") approach the music with enthusiasm and energy, and they are especially effective in the un-metered plainchant phrases mentioned above.This MHS version was produced directly from master tapes supplied by DG Archiv in Germany. I know, because I'm the person who produced this CD release for MHS. With MHS now out of business, and with the spotty distribution Universal/DG gives to releases of this nature, you should purchase this CD while you have the chance.Well worth the more-than-reasonable price being offered by numerous Amazon Marketplace sellers.Recommended."
1,Poorly written and dull..,"There is no doubt that she was talented and beautiful and suffered a lot in her life ( who doesn't). However, the book is very dull and boring. David Niven did a memorable job in his book about the same era, with scandalous snippets and interesting tit-bits. Rosalind places herself above such ""sins"", which is how she was. She continually upsets the chronology of the events in her life thereby creating confusion, this could be because she was so unwell since 1960 - and that really upsets the apple cart.Few years back, I watched Picnic on TV ( though not aware who she was), I seem to remember her acting; which was totally uninhibited.However, this book is a loser and doesn't entertain at all. Her cheerfulness and supposed candor becomes forced and contrived.Avoid..."
5,Fantasy,"This movie is so interesting.It has such a great world.Most people I know wish they could live there,and I love it too. It's my all time favorite movie around.My child even did a report for school on the Luck Dragon.It was just a great movie & I would recommend this to everyone who loves fantasy, quests, out of this world creatures, and even don't mind a little sadness."
5,The Neverending Story will never leave your mind...,"I can remember when I was a kid and watching this movie. It was so good. Even as a kid and now an adult, I loved the music. The music is what makes the movie.The villians and heros in this movie, work together to struggle against the other. Nothing at all is boring in this flick. A true classic from the 80s. This movie should not have had any sequels. NEVERENDING STORY II and III are terrible and can't imagine why any Hollywood studio or producer would want to make sequels that were that terrible and call them ""movies"".Do not pass up the orignial NEVERENDING STORY. It will entertain you for sure,for a good hour and a half."
5,Nostalgia at its best....,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 5 and have never stopped loving it. There's so much fantasy, wonderful characters and beauty in this film. The music is great also. I don't think anyone will regret buying this movie, especially if you saw for the first time when you were younger. Buy it!"
4,Awesome,"This was intended to be a childrens film but it is certainly worth the time for everyone to watch. A very sweet movie with interesting characters,music,and of course a good lesson to be told.. Over all a great movie."
3,Childhood classic,"There are a few negative reviews of this movie, mostly ""omg the book was so much better"" and ""neverending? it's only an hour and a half long!""...I haven't read the book, but I have always enjoyed this movie. I think it's a movie that everyone should see at some point in their lives. As far as the people who expected the movie itself to actually NOT END... that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. If you actually pay attention to the movie, the point is that as long as people have hopes and dreams, the HUMAN story never ends.The DVD itself isn't the best quality, but the movie was filmed in the early 80s.The movie is $5. Buy it and decide for yourself if you like it or not. If you don't, you can always trade it in at a used video store. I also recommend checking out the sequel."
5,this movie really needs a widescreen remastered version,"I love this movie, ever since when I was a kid. The part where Atreyu being called up and he finally accept his errand, and there the awd aspiring bg music raised and that feeling is just incredible. Some years later after I first watched the movie, when I got hands on my belovable Super Nintendo and played the Final Fantasy II(as now IV on Playstation), I oddly discovered the obvious similarity emotion( listen to their music scores, especially the beginning parts of game) between the movie and video games, I think the Japanese game developers are pretty serious fan of Neverending Story.What I'm suggesting the producer here is to make the remastered version, this DVD sucks, no widescreen, sloppy Stereo, and the video is worse than today's TV standard. This movie really deserves it, the idea that the line between reader and the book their reading getting thiner and the reader starts to get ""involved"" is revolutionary."
5,Great movie,This brought us right back to our childhood. My and I enjoyed it but my 7 year-old daughter enjoyed it just as much. A classic movie.
3,Slightly Damaged,"The case had a piece broken out of it, and the plastic that holds the DVD in place was broken, so the DVD moved around in shipping and got scratched on one side. Fortunately, the other side was not scratched. The damage to the case probably happened during shipping. Maybe more padding is needed when shipping this type of case."
3,Bought as a gift...definately NOT for me!,"First of all, the reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 is because of average. My husband, for whom I bought the DVD, absolutely LOVES this movie. It's one of his all time favorites and everytime it's on television, I am forced to watch it. I figured that by purchasing it for him, he could watch it whenever he wanted to. Without a doubt, he would give this movie a 5.By today's standards, the special effects are lame. The story is too, in my opinion. Maybe children may enjoy it, but today there are so many other really wonderful movies out that I'm not sure that even a kid would be mezmorized by it.Just my opinion...my husband firmly disagrees."
2,The Neverending Story- A critcal analysis,I have only a few words to say- The Book was WAY better. The movie is based on fallacies that aren't present in the book. It's only saving grace are the adorable and strange characters of Fantastica
3,Ok,"First of all, can't expect too much of the special effects, one of the downside of old fantasy movies after being spoilt by Harry Porter, Lord of the Ring, etc.Secondly, the story line is not that captivating. So, I will only recommend that for kids only."
2,"If dad is distant, hard movie for kids to watch & hope for.","The theme of reconciliation with dad that occurs in the Neverending Story might be great for all those kids out there with great dads, but for my kids whose dad doesn't reconcile/apologize for anything, I think the movie teaches kids they have to be heroes themselves and maybe then dad will come and everything will be alright. Do you know how hard kids try to make this happen? Let this be a cue to dad's out there to watch the movie and, if there's ever been a time when your relationship with your kid wasn't great, to go to your kid and apologize and get some professional help for both of you to really work it out."
4,Fanciful and Fun,"One of the earliest ventures in ""other world"" adventures. The settings are simplistic but effective if you let the story lead you.My family watched it often, and to this day refer to some of the characters: Atraus...the ""rock man"" , and, of course the silvery dragon"". We joined the boy reading the story in his reactions to the storyline. Hero, villain, Princess in distress...a keeper."
5,Any age group can love it,"This is one of the most compelling stories I have ever watched, with or without my children. It has a wonderful story line and terrific special effects which grip a child's imagination from the start because of the central characters being children."
3,Classic Children's Movie from the 1980s,"Definitely a classic. Definitely a children's movie. Amazing muppets by Henson & an interesting twist toward the end. Mediocre acting, mediocre character development."
5,Neverending Enjoyment,The Neverending Story has been a perfect childhood movie since it's induction into the greatest kids' movies of all time. I've watched this movie growing up and continue to share it with the younger friends and family.
4,Brilliant Movie; Unsatisfactory DVD,"This is a brilliant movie not only for kids, but for teens and adults as well. It's a fantasy film that makes us believe that there is always hope in this sad little world we live in. It also has memorable characters (who can forget Atreyu, Falkor, and Gmork?), amazing special effects (the Ivory Tower is purely monumental), and a spell-binding musical score (it's all keyboards instead of an actual orchestra but its still as effective).It's a shame that this movie didn't get the special DVD treatment that it deserved. Yes, the picture quality is almost perfect, but there are only minimal special features. Let's hope that a Special Edition DVD comes along soon."
5,What an amazing movie...,"True, this movie may not be the best as far as acting, or filming, or anything, but the story beats out anything else that I ever watched as a kid. Neverending Story is a true fantasy movie, but it gets me every time, and I'm almost 21 years old! I'd have to say that this makes my top 5 list."
2,Blu Ray ok movie was not,This is for children with imagination. I watched this 30 times as a kid and loved it. I have no idea why its pretty simple and bad. Kids may still sit through it.
5,"This movie is an original, unlike others who copy each other, its EXCELLENT!","I first saw this movie with my son about 15 years ago, and was amazed at the originality of the storyline, cinematography, and fantastic characters. My son just loved the movie and watched it over and over again. I couldn't help but love the movie, and watch it with him, it just always caught my attention. To this day, I still love this movie. Though they have come out with parts two and three, this one is my favorite of them all. And thankfully no other film-makers have tried to copy the idea, because it would flop if they did, you just can't top this story. When my children grow up and have their own, I'll be watching it with my grandchildren too! Jim Henson had a hand in this movie, so understandably, some of the characters are very well done by him. This movie is just a pure classic, and always will be, it cannot be outdone! It's a wonderful fantasy, for children and parents alike."
1,"WAY overrated, horrible movie","Cheesy script, poor acting and [bad] special effects make this movie a total [flop.] I walked out of the theater when it was released."
3,the american neverending story...,"I love this film so much. That depends also on the great soundtrack written by Klaus Doldinger. I only knew the German version and I have seen the American version now. But I was disappointed a bit because the film music of the German movie is different from the American, and I must say the german is much better!!! I can't understand why the producer used a different soundtrack for the same film. I can only offer watching the German version or listening the German film music!!!"
4,A neverending classic,"Such a great movie didnt deserve such a horrible sequel!This release lacks some extra features, but viewing this classic in HD is just a treat."
3,"My favorite movie ever, disappointing DVD","I love this movie, but the DVD was nothing spectacular. Not much in the way of special features, and theres not much else there other than a bit better quality than my VHS edition. It wasn't remastered, it does not have commentary or the sort. Plus I have to agree with the other guy- the book is so much better- but that doenst change my opinion of themmove. I loved it when I was 2 and I love it now. My kids and can watch it together.So go out and buy this DVD- it'll last forever and you can watch it again and again- but dont expect much else than that."
5,wonderful,an eternally magical and awe inspiring production that appeals to children and adults. Sometimes there is a great story to be told and its incarnation on the screen really does it justice. This is the one.
5,ONE OF THE BEST CHILDREN'S MOVIES EVER!!,"In my eyes, this was, without a doubt, one of the best movies ever made- and from one of the best children's books ever made. In our high-tech generation, this movie stands for so much that I believe in wholeheartedly!- a love of books and creativity(using the imagination). I am reading through the book with my son(7 YRS) before I show him this movie. He is loving it! This is a definite family movie for the collection. Grab it now!!!!!!"
5,Why not the whole Cake?,"Like every other 80's child in the world, I am absolutely ecstatic about this incredible movie finally coming out on DVD, however, I am somewhat disappointed at the lack of special features added to it. With nothing more than Region 1 Encoding and Surround Sound, we are still left in mystery as to how they managed the breath-taking special effects, deleted scenes, or even a comentary by Peterson. Hopefully sometime in the near future, they will release a full-monty DVD of The Neverending Story and we will finally be at rest as to how this extraordinary movie came to be!"
4,Its OK,The plot was good but the story needed a little work.I think the way all the events in the Movie were set up was odd.
5,The Never Ending Story,"This is a great movie for all ages. It's a modern ""Wizard of Oz"" story and I hghly recommend it."
4,My daughters favorite,When my daughter was little she watched this over and over. We bought for the memories but she has watched it a couple of times since.
3,A pleasant experience.,"You could actually follow the story, once things kicked off because the action was gripping and you wanted the hero to win.It was funny to watch how the boy would read the story and that made things happen in the dream world.The chosen boy (Atreyu) to seek out the saving grace for Fantasia was very strong-minded and wouldn't give up for anything.What was most interesting was that I liked this a lot as a kid and could watch it now as a 23 year old adult.Probably worth another watch in a few months.3.8 stars."
2,"False advertising, The story DOES END !!!","SO I'm watching it and thinking, 'It must be looped or something, How else could it be Never Ending'. Next thing I know BAM, it over. What a rip off."
1,"Compared to the book, this movie is horrid!","When I was very young, i saw this movie and thought it was...okay. Now that I'm older I've done something that many people feel to be boring or useless. I've actually READ THE BOOK and it is glorious! For one thing, the book is much more in depth, Artax can talk in the book, Falkor looks ""leonine"" (it specifically states ""leonine face""), Atreyu is much more noble, and the southern oracle is way more than just a couple of sphinxes. One thing I want to clear up forever: FALKOR IS NOT A GIANT FLYING DOG! HE IS A LUCK DRAGON AND IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK PEARLY WHITE, DRAGONLIKE, AND LIONLIKE AT THE SAME TIME! Also, the book goes way beyond Bastian just saying the child-like empresses' name. The second, and especially the third movies are even worse! They should each have -10 stars! This one is lucky to get one. All you people so enthralled with this horrid scrap of screentime you call a movie should read the book. It is much better. The books always are."
1,Waste of a Blu-Ray disc,"I picked this up out of the bargain bin at the local big box store, where it was only one of two Blu-Ray titles on sale. I love the movie, but even paying bargain bin price I felt cheated after buying this disc.I have a 1080p HDTV and a Blu-Ray player connected by HDMI cable. The back of the box says it's 1080p, but it looks awful for a Blu-Ray movie. They didn't bother with any picture enhancements AT ALL. The colors are off, and there's noise and artifacts, which are inexcusable on BD. Not only is the transfer extremely LAZY, there are NO extra features. Not one. The sound was OK but I can't judge the 5:1 because I don't have a surround sound system.If you have one of the DVD releases, don't bother getting this one. Shame on WB for the cheap money grab."
5,Good price,I haven't ever met anyone that didn't like this movie. I bought it at a good price so that my 5 year old can enjoy it as much as I did.
4,This is a perfect childrens & adults flick anytime (sci-fi!),"This is a perfect childrens & adults flick anytime (sci-fi!) I have no kids (just my siblings kids) I am 26 years old and have two best friends one is 39 and one is 41. If you are ever bored on a friday night and have an ""extended family"" as I descirbed above then this movie makes for a perfect heart felt weekend evening! It's touching, pure, and at times overwhelming even though it is not very technically wonderful. I LOVE this movie even though its not specifically geared towards adults!"
4,Such a sweet movie,"I bought this b/c I used to watch it all the time when I was a kid. I loved it, and would watch it over and over again. Thing is, I looked around on Amazon, and this movie comes in a set w/ Part 2 and 3. That is where the value is, so look around. You can get 2 movies for the price of one.If you don't own this movie, ADD IT TO YOUR CART today :)"
5,The best movie ever,"I really love it, I saw it when I was like 10 years and I still love it it's just like the book, I think Machael Ende is very proud of it.Everybody have to see it."
3,Let's hope a Region One disc comes along.,"Is there a video transfer error or is it just me? It seems that in one specific scene we don't get to see the entire glow from one of the yellow sphinxes. Other than that, there's the minor inconvenience of having to turn off the subtitles before viewing the movie. Quite frankly, when I think of the steep price I payed, the inconveniences I just mentioned seem quite more annoying."
2,movie,Bought this item because it was a old time favorite from when I was a kid. Thought my son might enjoy it. Was shipped fast so I was happy with that. However the quality of the movie was not impressive at all. It looked as if it had been a poor copy of an original.
1,Never heard the Never Ending Story,"While I love the movie and had it on vhs, I could not show it since I only had a DVD player. Go To Amazon I thought. It was no problem to order the story or have it come up on my intell computer except for the fact that the sound was too low for my class to hear. I tried every adjustment I could find. Amazon, the sound level on the computer and even going to my computer settings to fix it. We had to turn it off unwatched after about 15 minutes."
2,volume does not work,volume does not work will not play properly.tried several players and did not work on any of them.have to blast tv just to get little soung.
5,A true classic never ending story...,"If only there were movies like this one being made with this much imagination and story-scape for our spoon-fed undiciplined kids. This is an ominous and wonderfully enriched fantasy experience and is not to be compared to the presently mass produced predictable and repetative adult jargon filled cartoon computer crap. Not that the Computer stuff is bad, its just not as good as The Never Ending Story;Thats all...This movie definitely deserves 5 stars for creativity and greatness, and Atreyu shall rightfully have his hand imprinted into one of the Hollywood Stars.OUt"
5,Probably one of the most favourable movies of all time....,"This has to be not just the best movie of all time, but the whole 'Story'. Me being a Fantasy Fanatic, I have 'The Neverending Story' OST, VHS, now all I need is the DVD! I have to admit, the actual book was better, because you don't get to see Bastian, you have to imagine, even fantasise what he looks like. The late Michael Ende has done a very FINE job, in reminding people to use their imagination as much as possible....I hope many other people shares the adventures Bastian encounters, enjoy the film..."
5,The best movie ever!,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies of all time for the young and the young-at-heart. It is by far one of the best movies for teaching an all-important lesson, in a powerful way -- to always believe in yourself. I saw this movie as a kid and back then, did not realize the profound message of this movie and its significance. Now, fully grown and a viewer of this DVD on a regular basis, it continues to move and inspire me on a deep level. I love Barret Oliver, yes he is very much ""eye candy"" and a wonderfully gifted actor. The whole movie is just awesome and I highly recommend it to our generation and to the next and future generations following. They will love it, I believe, as much as we do! Long-live ""The Neverending Story"" -- may it truly, ""never end."""
5,Neverending joy,"This wonderfully portrayed movie based on the book by Michael Ende, is a true work of art. I first saw this movie as a child, and remember being completely overwhelmed by the story. This movie filled me with a sense of awe, and inspired me to believe that every one of us counts. We should never lose sight of our dreams, of lose faith in ourselves. I am now a parent and have shared this beautiful film with my two children. There are few films out there that can convey so many good, strong, moral messages as easily and clearly as The Neverending Story. I believe that everyone who watches this movie or reads the book will benefit from crying and cheering along with the characters."
4,NEVERENDING WONDER,"I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVE WHEN I SAW IN ON THE BIG SCREEN WHEN I WAS 12. I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE WAS VERY GOOD. I BOUGHT THIS DVD LAST NIGHT. OVER THE YEARS, WHEN I WOULD SEE THIS MOVE ON CABLE OR ON VHS, IT WAS NEVER IN WIDE SCREEN. I BOUGHT THE LD (USED) AT A PAWN SHOP. I WAS IN WIDE SCREEN, BUT SOMEHOW THEY GOOFED ON THE ASPECT. THE LD WAS 185 BUT THE DVD WAS 235. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE CORRECT ASPECT OF THE MOVIE ON DVD. THE FILM LOOKED REALLY GOOD, KNOWING THE AGE OF THE MOVIE. THEY COULD HAVE INCLUDED MORE INFO ON THE MOVIE THEN WHAT THEY DID. THE TRAILER IS PRETTY GOOD. I GAVE THIS DVD 4 STARES CAUSE THEY COULD HAVE INCLUDED MORE ON THE DVD, BUT THE MOVE IS REALLY GREAT! I LOVE IT EVEN THOUGH IM 30 YRS OLD!"
3,for little ones,"We watched this film with a mixed-ages group, and the reactions were decidedly mixed: the littlest kids were scared, the preschoolers liked it, and the older kids and adults were laughing when they weren't bored. While the story is terrific, the effects are too dated for today's sfx-jaded viewers. You'd be much better off reading the book.Also, the dvd extras are bad. There is a trailer but all other features (Cast & Crew, The Heroes, The Childlike Empress, The People of Fantasia) are just a screen or two of text. The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are available in English, French or Spanish.You can see why this film was loved, but it's almost unwatchable for all but preschoolers today."
2,"Great movie, bad transfer","I love this movie, but you should know before you buy, that it looks like they just transferred it from the DVD. It doesn't look bad, but it doesn't look like blu-ray"
5,Child of the 80's,"This is the kind of movie (like so many of those from the 80's) where, if you did not see it around the time it came out, you cannot fully appreciate the magic of it.It's such an enchanting story. If you liked it when you were a kid, there's no doubt in my mind that it will always have a place in your collection. If not, you may like it, but all of today's computer generated characters will probably leave you wanting something more. Read the book."
3,Neverending Story blu-ray critique,"The other reviewer complained about having to turn off the subtitles with every viewing, that is just a minor annoyance I can deal with. I do have two complaints though considering the price of this disc. First off: I've seen several blu-rays and most of them appear to be sharper than this one. Second: They could have used a better transfer, usually when movies are presented in high definition the film is normally cleaned up, but on this one I notice a few scratches here and there and small white spots throughout the disc. All in all I say this movie(one of my favorites-which is why I bought it) is in need of remastering."
1,nonononononononononononononono,I suppose most of you who are raving on haven't read the book. If you do you'll realise the movie is trash. It stops where the book actually begins! Whoever made this movie just ddn't get what the book was about - it has so much depth!!!! The movie is just superficial special effects. Forget it! The movie ends with someone saying how many wishes Bastian gets to have fulfilled. The book shows just how furtile the entire proces of wishing is; it is a mystical tour-de-force. The book is 10 million times the calibre of a cartain litle wizard who is getting too famous for the good of him. It has depth. It has everything. Read it! ANd forget this movie.
1,Lives Up to the Title,"I am sorry to offend anyone who lent a hand in producing this film, but I can remember our teacher showing this film to us as a treat on Valentine's Day one year back in elementary school. I cannot remember every meticulous detail of the plot, but I do remember the key details, such as a boy escaping from a store with a book that helped to unlock a whimsical world and having to help its residents protect their dying queen. I can remember being bored by the film, and if I had to say one thing about it, it would be this: if they were trying to make it live up to its title, they did a fantastic job."
1,"Incoherent, hard to follow","It was slow, but that's ok - it is from another era. However either the version I watched on Amazon was chopped badly or the movie really is incoherent, hard to follow with things and characters popping in an out for no apparent reason. Seemed quite chaotic, the music was too much. A badly told story. Don't waste your money on it."
2,Expanding your mind through books and bad German dubbing is a no-no,"Viewing a movie as an adult that you once enjoyed as a kid is a good way to see if it stands the test of time. Many of those films that stand the test of time are from the Fantasy genre, including Labyrinth and Dark Crystal. Would I add Neverending Story to that list? Hell no. The dubbing is atrocious (funny Germans), and the costumes and ""effects"" are flat-out bad. Labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days, and easily trumped Neverending Story when it was released two years later. The story and plot had the potential to be interesting, but the execution makes Neverending fall flat. And sure, Neverending Story may have advocated reading in the mid-80's, but Labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics, which is the next step up for mind expansion."
2,A little dusty,"Notwithstanding the greatness of the special effects, the whole content and message of the film have not aged terribly well. In today's world, children need a message a little deeper than: ""Wish and it will come true"". The ultimate irony of the film though is the fact that it has been outfoxed by a video game version known as ""Final Fantasy Tactics Advance"". In that game Sebastian's wishing turns on him creating a fictional world where he becomes a tyrant and no one grows emotionally. This irony is compounded because the bookstore owner in the film warns the audience against the ""shallowness"" of video games."
3,pseudo- paganism,"I saw this film when I was a young child in the good ol' 1980's.the whole Idea of this film is WHEN DOES THE MOONCHILD MAGUS BEGIN AND THE WHITE-LIGHT EGOTIST TAKE OVER. if you want a real movie about content of humanist character study try the Tod Browning film FREAKS (for the TRULY PERCEPTIVE) learn MORE INTO the difference between TRUE HUMAN MERIT VS PSYCHIC VAMPIRES WHOM ONLY CHOOSE TO USE AND ABUSE PEOPLE. this film only teaches children and adults alike literary ESCAPE-ISM...A TOTAl WASTE OF TIME,just a CUTE MOVIE,nothing more. surprisingly the book is much better.trust me on this one."
1,Life is too short to be preached at by arrogant little boys.,"How odd that a movie based on a novel that encourages kids to read has no: cohesive narrative, interesting characters, pacing, originality, or redeeming value! There are so many better fantasy movies aimed at children than this. ""The Dark Crystal"" springs to mind. This movie is preachy, pretentious (I've read this and this and this and this and this!), and flat-out dull. I suggest you try a fantasy movie that doesn't insult your intelligence before you wrestle with this trash.P.S. What's the father's problem? His wife and the mother of his son just died, and he treats his obviously severely introverted son like a poop trailer."
1,Review of The Never Ending Story CD,Very poor quality sound. Appears to be a copy of the original. Very dissatisfied with purchase.
2,Lies Lies Lies,"SO I'm watching it and thinking, 'It must be looped or something, How else could it be Never Ending'. Next thing I know BAM, it over. What a rip off..."
3,"All Right, Not But Not as Good as the Book","This movie was enjoyable. I was a bit disappointed, but that was probably because my expectations were too high. The book was one of the two or three best fantasies I've ever read. If you enjoyed the movie, try the book. If you didn't like the movie, but you enjoy fantasy, try the book. If you've read the book, the movie is still worth seeing. Don't expect a great movie and you'll probably find a good one."
3,THE NEVERENDING STORY {BLU-RAY},"I saw this years ago on regular TV & thought that it might look pretty good on Blu-Ray. It's not terrible, but just ok to me. I was not that impressed. Some scenes were nice & others were so-so. It also was grainier in some spots than you would like. The sound seemed good to me & there are no Special Features. It's done in the 2:40:1 aspect ratio which surprises me. I would have thought for a children's movie they would have done it in the full screen 1:85:1 aspect ratio. If you have kids or have seen this movie I say go ahead & get it at a good price, but don't expect to be over whelmed."
3,I know alot of people joke.,Alot of people make the joke that this movie never ends. I beg to differ. It was 1.5 hours of torturous boring non lethal boring. Where was Rocky?
2,"Sensoring, really?","I love this movie but give it 2 out of 5 stars, as I noticed on two occassions that dubbing was enacted to sensor the swear word. Completely disappointed by this."
3,"Funny, But No Comparison to the Griswolds' First or Third Vacations","This has its moments, but a lot of the magic that oozed from the original is missing. I chalk that up to an increase in slapstick and zany situations, plus an almost total withdrawal from the quieter character moments that grounded the family's first vacation. While the original film definitely had its silly tendencies, it also seemed to know when to tighten the reins and slow down a bit, while the European chapter is content to keep plowing straight ahead, often leaping well beyond the limits of belief. There are definitely some rich laughs to be had, particularly when Clark participates in a traditional Octoberfest dance or a French waiter speaks his mind via subtitles, but my favorite bits always seem to involve the family's personalities ricocheting off of each other and those take a clear back seat to the puns and sight gags this time around."
1,Do NOT Upgrade to Blu-ray,"Worst Blu-ray transfer I've ever seen. So much so that I had to pull out the original DVD to check it out. Lo and behold, the standard DVD ACTUALLY LOOKS BETTER than the Blu-ray. I was able to ""upgrade"" to blu for only $5, but I thought it was necessary to let anyone else know to save their money...even if it is only 5 bucks. If you don't already own the movie and still want it, you may want to look for the DVD version instead as you can probably get it cheaper."
1,Disappointing trash,"Do not buy this movie! This is the most disappointing Vacation movie out there. Not only was it very slow, it included multiple shots of female frontal nudity, which wasn't expected as it was only PG-13! Buy Vegas Vacation or Christmas Vacation instead. Both of those movies are hilarious."
2,The Griswalds take on Europe,"This time Clark Griswald and family win a European vacation on a television gameshow.The worst of the vacation movies, it's not that there are no laughs there are a few,mostly provided by Chevy Chase. The laughs aren't often enough, and there are too few of them. The scene were Clark backs into Stonehedge is classic. If you must see this, I recommend renting this instead of buying it."
3,Not appropriate for persons under 18,"I suggested the title for this review due to the actual events in the movie. There are many areas that are not appropriate for any children under the age of 18. Children should not be viewing boarderline scenes of adultry, frequent cursing, sexual scenes or spouse disrespect in front of children. I wish that the producer or director would have used better judgment in regards to setting the example for the younger audiance and for the entire family. It's an okay film but I would not suggest viewing outside of the adult realm. Commedy can be clean and still be funny. The overall facts regarding this film is that this movie is not clean commedy. Sorry I did not use better judgment."
2,OK,"Not as good as all the rest. It was just ok. Funny in some spots,sick in some other parts. If you are in the mood to get a stupid movie this is the one! You must see Vacation! It`s the best!"
1,Oh boy,"Another trip for the Griswalds. It just doesn't work in Europe of course, and neither does the plot. So not funny."
1,Zero stars. Please don't buy this.,"I'm flabbergasted that they put the dumbed-down tv version of this movie on dvd and not the theatrical version. They took scenes out, changed scenes and dubbed dialog to create this mess of a dvd. Not only that, but the movie looks funny. The aspect ratio they used makes the movie look weird. I was eagerly waiting for this funny, well-done movie to be released on dvd and I am bitterly disappointed at this made-for-tv garbage. This tv version will only appeal to an unsophisticated mass audience.Attention Warner Home Video: If you are reading this, you need to issue a press release in which you apologize for this garbage and then announce that you will release an uncut version of the movie on dvd."
2,NOT the original theatrical version!,This is NOT the original version!!! I'm very disappointed that Amazon.com didn't disclose this information. Scenes are missing and parts are dubbed over. Funny parts are still funny but it's just not the same. I feel duped.
1,"Rating the disc, not the movie.","I of course love the first two ""Vacation"" movies and I always will. So I was excited to see this come out on Blu-Ray. Sadly, this is yet another ""cas grab"" Blu-Ray that is nothing more than an upconverted DVD in disguise - grainy picture, mediocre sound. You're better off saving a few dollars and getting the DVD instead, as you'll get the exact same home theater experience."
2,maybe the worst looking blu ray I own....what a waste of money!,Do NOT sell your normal DVD to move up (LOL) to this abomination of a blu ray....from the opening WB logo which appears grainy and soft...you know whats coming and that is a low quality blu ray . I'd avoid until WB actually upgrades the VACATION series....the first one also came out on blu ray and its marginally better...still not worth the exchange..save your money.
5,Is this going to be coming out on DVD soon?,"If anyone can tell me if European Vaction is coming out on DVD in the future or if it going to be released as a Boxed-Set to go along with Vaction, Christmas Vaction, and Vegas Vaction which on already on DVD, please let me know."
4,"Different country, same Griswolds!","America's favorite screwball family heads to Europe for the second installment of the National Lampoon's Vacation series. It begins when the Griswolds win a trip on a game show. They start out in England, with my favorite scene where they get stuck in a roundabout for several hours and by the end Clark is just hysterical. In England they also run into (literally) Eric Idle for the first time in the movie. In Germany, they spend time with complete strangers, thinking they are Clark's relatives and Clark starts a brawl at a beer-fest. In France, Ellen is kidnapped and Eric Idle appears again. This movie is like a comedy/adventure, there are a couple of car chases mixed in with the many laughs.This movie is like an exaggeration of everyone's worst family vacation. There are points where they all get annoyed with each other, but in the end they are still family and love each other."
3,It's good but not as good as the others,"Any person like me who is a fan of these vacation movies can tell that this might be the lower of all the vacation movies. But like many have said it does have its funny moments but then it is missing the spark that the original vacation movie had and you can't even compare it to Christmas Vacation. I even liked Vegas Vacation more better than this. I think the Griswald's need to stay in america like they do in most of there movies it seems to be funnier and being overseas just does not work correctly with these type of movies. The plot is also the most lame and dumbest of all movies, but yet again this is funny but not a smash hit."
2,National Lampoons European Vacation. By Mark Stassen,"Dir Amy Heckerling,Starring,Chevy Chase, Jason Lively,Dana Hill and Eric Idle,Robbie Coltrane,Mel Smith.(1985)The Griswolds head for Europe.Memorable cameo appearances by Eric Idle of 'Monty Python' ,Robbie Coltrane of 'Cracker', British Drama Series.(Chase) gives a great performance,as well as his son Rusty (Lively) But to be honest (Hill)did not work for me as the gluttenous Audrey.On the other hand it's great for laugh or two , and perfect for the family. Mark Stassen."
3,Clark Griswold strikes again.......in Europe!!!!!!!,"The Griswolds stumble into victory on a goofy gameshow and win an ""all inclusive"" vacation around Europe. While Clark and Ellen provide their usual hilarious antics, the children do not meet up to par. Rusty is boring and Audry is fat and annoying. This movie however is a must for Chevy Chase fans. One classic line from the movie comes when Rusty is whining (as usual) about wearing a beret when they get to France, Clark says to him, ""That's the national hat there fella!"" You have to see it to appreciate it. Personally I was not disappointed."
3,Classier than film one,Although the original Audrey in National Lampoon's Vacaction was a really cute girl (I had a crush on her when I saw the film in 1983) Dana Hill does a fairly good bit replacing her here. Chase and D'Angelo are back in top form (especially D'angelo) as the Griswold parents. I love Mrs. Griswold's stripping scene she performs in fron't of her husband's camera. The European locations beat the scenes of Chicago and the southwest from film one in giving the 2nd film much more sophistication. Eric Idle is painful to watch (like he is in all his non-Python work) in an irregular series of cameos.
5,Audrey calls chicago,"""Oink oink my good man. Don't call sharise a bimbo!"" ""Ah dad these barrets are really rank!"" ""Can't we split up and go our own way dad, by the way I've been good, I haven't tried to escape or anything!"" ""Can you pass the croiscants please and the butter and the Jelly"" ""Eating cause your mad at Jack Audrey?"" ""Well who I have got to be thin for , huh?"" ""Oh your parents are calling you away for dinner, O.K> I'll hold!"" ""Let me tally up the bill here for you"" ""The staff from Pig and the Poke will pay that!"" ""That doesnt include a telephone bill though, lets see, okay that'll be three hundred and forty two american dollars!"" ""What, I dont get it, who in the heck called Chicago! Audrey!"""
3,Problems with audio,"This is a review of the DVD itself, not the movie (not sure why people seem to want to review the movie itself in this forum).Overall, a good quality reproduction of the original. (This version does have the topless scenes, for those that have children...) However, the audio is not surround. When you play through a 5.1 speaker system, all the audio goes straight to the center speaker. I am not sure if this was a problem with the disc I received or the DVD in general.Extras: There are no deleted scenes. The only worthwhile extra is Chevy Chase's commentary, which is actually quite funny and revealing."
4,European Vacation(1985)****,"Once again, the Griswolds are at it again. This time they have won an all paid, all inclusive trip to Europe, by answering the grand prize question corrrectly on the tv show ""Pig in the Poke"". They get to stay in several different countries over the course of there vacation.(Some include France,Germany, etc.)Towards the end , they run in to some trouble with ""badguys"", but get out of it eventually as they always do.This movie wasn't as good as the others in the series, but i do recomend it."
1,THEY FORGOT TO PACK THE LAUGHS,"This second entry in the NL VACATION series is pretty lame; it's like the scriptwriters forgot to pack any laughs to accompany the Griswolds. I kept waiting for something really funny to happen as it did in the first Vacation film. But in this one, the Griswolds win a trip to Europe, and wind up destroying the Stonehenge in England; doing absolutely nothing in Paris; causing a brouhaha at a festival in Germany; and chasing kidnappers in Rome. Ho hum...and it's all done with no verve or energy. Chevy Chase looks bored to tears and Beverly D'Angelo tries so hard it's pitiful. The kids, Dana Hill and Jason Lively, are even more obnoxious than the first time. All in all, a capital offense: a comedy that just isn't funny."
2,The worst of the series,Mildly amusing at times. But the worst of the Vacation series! The actors playing the Griswald children in this one are by far the most annoying of the series bunch! This one just missed the mark!
3,Fumble Rules,It will be interesting to see my students reactions to some of the information contained in this book.
4,This book is good on what it hits.,"But it focuses on IP routing. This book contains lots of information on analyzing IP routing processes but other than the includion of IS-IS, there are no non-IP routing protocols covered. A more appropriate name for this book would be ""Cisco Router IP Configuration: Answers!"". Extra credit is given for not taking 10 pages to explain a simple concept like most technical books do today. Keeping it short and to the point brought my evaluation up from 3 stars to 4."
3,just another book on cisco,"The book has question and answer format.It is good for novices encountering IOS for the first time. It only covers the fundamental configurations and does not really talk about different pitfalls.I primarily bought it to get some help on BGP cases and it did answer some of my questions regarding route-maps etc. Some of the examples are wrong. For instance on page 196, as-path access list example, refers to access-list 100 but the access list actually later configured is 200... this kind of thing can throw new folks off a little bit.It does not talk about RSVP and MPLS/Tag switching at all.Not a must buy but it can help you on and off resolving day to day problems with IOS."
3,"Good, Not Great","As Civil War histories go, this one falls on the upper end of the middle of the pack. The articles are, overall, well-written and well-presented. Although better histories of the 1862 campaign do exist (see James McPherson, ""Antietam: Crossroads of Freedom""), this is a good collection of essays.This may be a bit petty to mention, but the book is square (as opposed to rectangular), and does not fit well on a bookshelf."
2,cell phone battery,Battery ok i guess but it took 2 weeks to get it !Would Not Buy From These People Again ! TOO SLOW !
1,Horribly Outdates,At the rate that computer technology is changing by the time you read any book it will be outdated. Steer clear of this book
3,Enjoyed this movie,I truly enjoyed the acting in this movie. I went through a similar experience recently and thought that the movie pretty accurately depicted the emotions that I have been cycling through and the erratic behavior that I have been exhibiting.
1,Pretty Darned Bad,"Promising cast, forgettable result. Greta Gerwig was delightful in ""Greenberg"", but here she plays a boring, self-absorbed 29-er (oooooh, big dilemma!!!!), whose ""problems"" are less than engrossing. She is surrounded by a bunch of cliche males, allof whom are also pretty annoying. Her parents are played (written and acted dismally) by the usually great Bill Pullman and Debra Winger. The poor writing and directing seem to have gotten the better of these fine actors.This is another in a slew of ""hip"", ""how-it-is-now"", pretentiously wry bits of fluff. A slightly edgier ""Sex and the City""... deep as a postage stamp. We didn't even finish watching it... there was no one to care about. And it wasn't very funny. You could find much better ways to spend your time..."
2,Could have been so much better,"This had the potential to be quirky, funny, and heartfelt. Instead, I was annoyed by the main character, knowing that she was about to make the wrong decision and like a trainwreck, unable to look away/turn the movie off. I really wanted to like it and perhaps that's why I'm so disappointed."
4,Solidly done rom-com,"A young woman is preparing for her wedding, when her fiancé suddenly leaves her. Heartbroken, she tries to get over it, while dealing with new relationship problems. The fiancé reemerges and she must decide whether or not to get back together with him. The underappreciated Greta Gerwig carries this one well, as the jilted woman who is trying to find her way in world of love and relationships. There is a solid combination of laughs and emotion here as the film touches on s subject many of us are familiar with. Big Screen portrayals of the pursuit of companionship are as old as film itself, but when done in a quality manner, they are always enjoyable."
2,"sorry, it's boring","I like Greta Gerwig, but this movie was not a good vehicle for her. I didn't end up caring much for her character or any of the other chracters. And it kind of dragged. A little uneveness is okay if it keeps you entertained, but I was mostly bored."
4,"You heard me: ""Good, Nu-Metal""","TWELVE TRIBES - The Rebirth of Tragedy-Well title just about sums it up.... ""Good Nu-Metal"" - Twelve Tribes adds some serious Talentand musicianship, Song writing skills and a Refreshing Vibe to a desperately dying scene. The Rebirth of Tragedy is a solid CD from start to finish. At first I felt ashamed to like something so blatantly Nu-Metal... But there is so much talent and so many great songs on this CD it is undeniable. Music is Music. Forget Titles and enjoy anything that pleases the ears.... Twelve Tribes do just that. Can't wait for anew album!Favorite Songs: Baboon Music, Venus Complex, Chroma, and Luna-3.75 STARSIF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?"""
5,Convienent Reading,"I have recently become a Quote Junkie and definitely appreciate the format of this book! Great reference, great reading and great inspiration!"
3,"Generic perl topic are OK, Win32 and NT specifics are poor","I bought this book as starter to learn more about Perl in general (and for Win32 systems). I found the very first chapters to be of good service, though I spotted these elementary Perl programming techniques in other O'Reilly books too. The Win32 part is in my opinion very poor, it doesn't explain things very well like OLE, reading/writing the Event log and other rudimentary system administration tasks. If you have a lot of free time on your hands like I sometimes tend to have, take some time to search for example scripts for Win32, and together with this book you will be able to understand. Though I think a new edition would be a good idea, covering specifically Win32 platform (people should buy other books to learn Perl in general, I do not like to see the same 3 chapters in every book over again)."
2,Too simple for programmers,"This book doesn't have enough in depth coverage of PERL. For a programmer, this book is too simple, for a non-programmer, this book is too hard."
4,"Easy to read, easy to understand.","I found that this book was good, particularly for the Win32 platform, and recommend it to anyone who uses Windows, regardless of their initial interest in programming. The only problems I had with the book are that the CGI (and OOP, which is introduced only in the context of CGI...but it could be so much more) chapter is left in limbo as far as being able to use any of the examples. If it were used on a Unix webserver (which are almost always setup to handle Perl CGI scripts), the examples would work fine. However, this is Perl for Win32, so IIS or PWS (if possible...I don't think it is, however) should be the web platforms targetted, and a ""quick and dirty"" setup instruction would be good to be able to test those examples."
3,"Ok language intro, but missing context","This book provided a reasonable introduction to the language elements. As a complete novice, I learned enough to read CGI scripts. It was helpful to work on the well-done examples and then to look at the answers. I would have preferred a ""log cracking"" example rather than ""secret words"". Although I got the syntax of the hashes, I missed their glory in solving problems. The regular expression examples were good, but I could have used a full-blown example here also. This book sent me searching for CGI/web packages, such as the database package DBI (which may have been more useful than the DBM), the graphics package (GD), and more on writing HTML code from Perl scripts."
2,Not enough depth,"The book was easy enought to read, and it represents the information in a simplistic manner, but it does not provide the depth needed to really program in Perl for a Win32 subsystem. Try the book by David Roth."
3,I was expecting more,"This is my second Perl book, and compared with the Dummies Guide I found it wanting. Being new to perl I hoped that the NT flavour would help me avoid all the problems of trying to run the typical Unix Perl scripts on NT. It's probably not that bad when coupled with a useful refrence book though."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"This book definitely wasn't all that it was meant to be I'm sure. Even with a background in programming it didn't accomplish much in actually helping to learn PERL, imagine if it was a non-programmer. The text was written in a fashion which can easily lose the reader."
2,No CGI. Not enough depth.,"Like most O'Reilly books. This is meant for hard-core programmers and not beginners. That said, the content is still rather shallow. As for CGI, Schwartz et al refer you to the other O'Reilly PERL books, which (of course) are written for UNIX weenies and are of no use to the NT/Win32 folks. So what good is that? Sigh."
5,None,"This is a very good book that teaches us to keep and use all our members such as our hands, feet, eyes, ears and mind for our Master's use. We are the vessel and He is the potter. Sherry"
5,Perfectly sticky,"Remained sticky long after my airsoft gun broke. Perfect size to hold a cat against its will. Simply place cat back first onto target, and keep off the ground!"
4,sticky target,"larger than i expected and lasts for a long time,easy to clean,and a fun target to practice your aim."
4,"Short, engaging and informative.","Bo Peabody is a successful entrepreneur, in this short engaging book he describes some of his experiences and tells us what he has learned. He answers the perennial question of whether or not he was lucky or smart by saying he is smart enough to know that he was getting lucky.The book makes no pretense of being a scholarly work, there are no citations, there is not even and index. This is explicitly the authors experience and opinions. None of his advise was surprising. All of it was clearly and well explained; usually with an entertaining anecdote.This short book is definitely worth reading for any would be entrepreneur, but is also worthwhile to anyone contemplating working at a start up. In fact it is an interesting read for most anyone."
5,Review,"The book offers an interesting perspective to how an entrepeneur thinks. If you work for a small business developed and run by one individual, you must read. If you don't work in this environment, it will offer an interesting insight into a large portion of the business environment."
1,Does not actually cut hair,"I just bought this this afternoon, I ran it through my hair and nothing happened. It does not actually cut hair, only move it around. If you want something to make a buzzing sound but not do anything there are probably cheaper options. But for me it was a waste of thirty dollars."
1,Arrogant is right - and not really up front either,Hipkat and ActionJunkie have summed it all up perfectly. Nothing else to add. Oh. Yes there is. I happened to be in a bookstore way back when this book was released and the Blanchardss were speaking. I pretty quickly observed they were quite charmed with themselves. I didn't stay to listen long. The book was passed to me by a co-worker. Couldn't finish it.
1,"If you enjoy arrogant and self indulgent authors, read this book!","I couldn't agree more with the above reviewer. Although the writing style and flow of the book was appealing, the attitude and lack of humility by the authors made it, at times, almost uncomfortable to read. For example, at one point they describe a hurricane that has hit the island and damaged their restaurant and say ""...you saved the wine cellar, brillant? Is the wine still in there?"" Paahleeeze! The very next sentence tells his employee to go home and clean up his damaged home but to be back 'first thing tomorrow morning with your tools and brothers to clean up his mess'. Anymore stories of what their personal strife (enormous shipping fees/taxes and the inconvenience of traveling back and forth from their ""Vermont"" home to pick up expensive materials) would have been pathetic. If you want to understand and appreciate the island life, don't buy this book."
3,"Dreamy, overall an okay read","There was a lot of fluff writing in this book. The idea of the book is very solid and, at the same time, whimsical. They have an awesome life story to tell, but the writing itself doesn't do the story justice."
5,"Caribbean Dreams, Island Ways...","Mel and Bob Blanchard have done what I feel many wish they could...just leave it all behind for that dream of a house overlooking the unbelievable Caribbean water. Their baptism into the island lifestyle will have you giggling and crying at some point during your read because they are sharing some very amazing experiences as they follow their dream (with more than a few potholes along the way). I loved this book and really want others to realize the charm of the Caribbean, beyond the beautiful beaches and in her lovely, warm, wonderful people! Having experienced this firsthand in my life, I was so thrilled to read a book that really conveyed that message. It will captivate you! I only now must figure out when I can make MY trip to Anguilla that I have wanted to do for several years. I know the trip will have been worth the wait!"
5,You'll want to go to this Beach,"A Trip to the Beach is a terrific book. Throughout the chapters the reader becomes very familiar with the cast of characters who help Bob and Mel Blanchard move to and open up a restaurant on the laid-back island of Anguilla. The book carries you through what life is like on ""island time"" and the challenge of trying to be organized on an unorganized Caribbean island. You get to know the Blanchard's and their staff at the restaurant on a personal level. The trials and tribulations of everything from clearing customs with a bed to trying to find fresh poultry above grade D in Anguilla will keep you smiling throughout the book. Highly recommended as good summer reading."
5,Takes Me Back to Island Time!,"As a Caribbean traveler, I couldn't put this one down! The Blanchard's have managed to transport you to Anguilla, and give hope to everyone that's ever dreamed of buying a place in the tropics! Reading about familiar places always makes a story more interesting and this one adds the ups and downs of my fellow New Englanders as they try to fulfill their dream. I also enjoyed getting to know the many friends and employees they describe in such a way it makes you want to hop a plane and meet them too. I was disappointed when the story ended..I could have read on and on. It really took me back to ""island time"" which is the best part of visiting the Caribbean! Great reading!"
4,"Wonderfully written, interesting, entertaining, loved this book.",I am always looking for good reads about life stories of those settling in the Caribbean as I have attempted several times. The Blanchards love of Anguilla matches my love of St. John and Tortola and now Dominica. After reading this book I also enjoyed Live what you Love and would really love it if they would write a sequel to A Trip to the Beach.
5,Great workout for the mind!,My two year old and three year old love this item. It is very versitle and helps the imagination!
4,Happy with the purchase!,"Easy to assemble and really adds something to the room. May not be bright enough as the only light in a room, but a good additional lighting piece. Very cute!"
2,Adorable but damaged,I was looking for a small white chandelier for my hallway and in terms of size and style this is exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately the first one I ordered had chipped paint as did the one I exchanged it for. I decided to keep it despite the chips and will touch it up myself.
4,Very cute,"Perfect for a small room. Very cute. Received many compliments. Only gave it a 4 because I wish it was a little bigger. Added a white medallion to the ceiling and it completed the look. We bought black nursery furniture and it looks great with the black chandelier. It is solid black, however, when you turn on the light there is a tiny hint of a red sparkle on some of the beads. Not very noticeable though and would still match any room. Almost like a hint of black ruby where the light touches it."
4,Tadpoles Three Bulp Pink Chandelier,"This is a real cute chandelier. My only criticism is that I wished it was 4 lights as oppose to 3 or at least you should be able to use 40 watt bulbs as oppose to limiting to just 25 watt. My daughter's room is 10 x 10 and the light is okay (just doing the job) but would be better if a tad lighter. In any event, the chandelier size is small and good for small space like over a bed where you do not want a big lighting fixture. It was an easy installation and to have the option of both hard wired as well as plug in gives versatility. I would definitely recommend."
3,Lovely,This is a lovely little chandelier. I wish it was a little bigger though. Its so cute. There is no on/off switch for those wanting to use this as a swag chandelier.
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this item and it arrived incomplete! I had to use an old pieces of equipment (prior lighting fixture) to install the item. I tried to return but Amazon stated it could not be returned only exchanged. I also found I couldn't leave feed back for Amazon items, Very upset!"
4,So cute! No switch on light though,"Exactly what I expected. A pair of them is super sexy in our modern boudoir. Replaced with much dimmer bulbs so they serve as two reading lights. They're plastic and definitely a cheap feel if you get up close to them, but you'd never notice from afar.As others have mentioned, there's no switch on the cord, so it's just on when you plug it in. I'll probably hack a switch onto the cord since we're not planning on mounting them."
5,Good for my use,"I ordered two in black as bed side lights. They were just the right size. I had been warned by other reviews about the off/on switch, so went to the hardware store and purchased switches within minutes my lights were hanging and turned on and off. They are perfect for my bed side."
4,"Gorgous, but cheaply made.","I purchased this chandelier as a housewarning presant for a friend. When it arrived i wanted to see it before i wrapped it, and i'm glad I did! Part of the strings had broken and all the beads fell off that part. I had to reattatch them by hand, so she would have it in time for the party. The light itself was BEAUTIFUL, and the reciever loved it, but still I wish it was better made."
5,Adorbale Chandelier,"We purchased two chandelier's for our daughters playroom, they are great!!! Really cute, they provide alot of light and were a great value!! I would highly recommend for any girls room."
3,Smaller than expected...,"Looks nice online, but in reality it is a small chandelier... I wish the description would have contained dimensions information. If you are planning on using this in a room bigger than 10' x 10', you may want to go with a larger piece.It also looks a bit cheap, I guess you get what you paid for..."
5,Shabby Chic,"It is absolutely adorable, petite & perfect for hanging in a corner. I got it for my teenegers room that's decorated in a black n white shabby chic style. It gives a pop a glitter."
3,small - CT,This arrived quickly and after reading the reviews before purchase I embraced for the delivery. I purchased the white one. This item is cute and it is small. I believe the problem is that on the scroll of metal there is clear beading instead of actual crystals. Since this is for my nursery I don't mind but if its for a girls who is pre-teen i would probably opt for another chandelier.I did not think that I would mind not having shades but since it is so small I ordered lamp shades from another place but even the mini shades are too big for this chandelier.I have a big nursery so my chandelier looks a little lost in there but I still like it.Hope this helps.
3,Overall nice with one small catch,"Overall I am happy with this light. I bought it to go over my teenage daughter's bed and she loves it. For the price it is perfect for this setting; however; although it can be plugged in vs. being direct wired there is no on and off switch. That means it must continually be plugged in and unplugged. I might have it rewired for that reason, but it is exactly the style she wanted and the amount I was willing to spend."
2,Too gaudy,Item arrived quickly and was well packaged.Bought this light fixture for our daughters room. It's cute but the larger plastic crystals are too big and so they all hang close together and overwhelm the overall look/feel of the light fixture making it entirely too gaudy and cheap looking. The same goes for the matching table lamp.
5,Very Cute! Great price,"I was looking for a small light for my teen daughters bedroom. Since her room is small, I had to have something dainty but with enough light to light the whole room. I was looking for something with some clear or crystal along with the black but had a hard time fining anything with more than one bulb. I found this and the price was great so I gave it a try and I'm so glad I did. This light is very pretty. And it's definitely fit for a diva. It has not been installed yet because it is a Christmas gift, so I will update soon once it is installed and I can give a better review."
3,"Nothing as good as Bad Habits, slower, less melodic, less punky.","I'm not sure what the Monks were thinking by following one of the best Brit-pop-punk albums of all time with this mellow, dragging lp. Sure, we love the reggae punk connection, but these tunes are slow and go on and on without much reward. There is very little fast melodic stuff like ""Love in Stereo"" on this lp. Maybe the Monks smoked too much weed when they got famous?"
3,"the monks, 'suspended animation' isn't worth $99 but i wouldn't shake a fist at $2","the monks have summed themselves up in one song, 'i can do anything you like'. good british musicians who regonize 'punk' as sound not fashion; but know that no one else does. all the same, its hard to take a song seriously when it feels like its making fun of you. no matter how many canadians want to sing along."
1,"William Goldman's destruction of ""The Princess Bride""","This version of The Princess Bride annoyed me in many ways. For instance, William Goldman deleted whole sections of the original story. As if he knew exactly what the reading public wanted to read. I for one, would much rather read an original classic than to read a butched story and spoon fed only selected portions. The title of this book should read ""The Princess Bride as written by S. Morgenstern as destroyed by William Goldman. Shame on you Mr. Goldman for destroying what could have been an enjoyable reading experience with your pointless cuts and intrusive ramblings."
1,Suprisingly BAD,"I loved the movie, and perhaps it was that that ruined this book for me. I found the fact that he kept pointing out WHERE he was skipping over the princess going over her zillion dresses and whatnot EXCEPTIONALLY dull.... I know why they left all of that out of the movie, it is boring. I usually keep a hold of all of the books I read. I don't own this one anymore."
1,So incredibly overrated!,This has to be one of the most egomanical books I've ever read. The forced cleverness and side bars are oh-so unnecessary! Can S. Morgenstern get his head through a door with an ego that big? I doubt it.A classic? Hardly. And it is basically a good storyline. It's such a pity that the author goes off on his self-aggrandizing chatter all the time.Do yourself a favor. Buy the movie! Peter Falk is worth the price of admission! Now there is a narrator!
1,What a pathetic book!,"This book brought tears to my eyes because it was so... AWFUL!!! I was expecting a nice fairy tale-and instead- I got a boring, stupid book where the author comes in every page and a half talking about how golf was invented then. This book is only, ONLY for people for really, really, really, quirked senses of humor! If tyhe rating of zero was available I would give the Princess Bride a -3. Not a worothy book!!!"
5,Best book ever written!!,"I just love this book! The movie was awesome too! Cary Elwes is amazing! LISTEN UP! S.Morgenstern is a REAL guy! He wrote the book. William Goldman abridged it. Don't listen to the bull from the other reviewers about S.Morgenstern being a figment of William Goldman's imagination. He's not. By the way, Florin and Gilder are made up but that was the name of the currency they used back then. I'm proud to say that I know all about it because I've watched the movie so many times."
3,Forget the book--watch the movie!!!,"This book has an extremely disappointing ending--it just left you hanging. At the beginning, the author's notes are amusing, but they grow very old very quickly. The movie is much, much better. If you must read this book, buy the paperback version and save yourself some money. Better yet, buy the video."
3,"Pass, the movie has the good parts","I had been wanting to read this book for years. I guess it was a big buildup that led to me be disappointed. I recommend if you want to read this book, skip over everything written in italics. Goldman should have just written his own story. The whole Morgenstern history and museum and all that was a major distraction."
4,Good book,"Length:: 1:57 MinsGood book, was better since I had seen the movie. Was a mix of a few genres of literature, so not for everyone."
4,Fantasy and fun,"The film the Princess Bride was my introduction to S. Morgenstern's true story of love and high adventure. Now, 25 years later, I have finally read the book. William Goldman does an excellent job of editing out the dry exposition about trees and musty dry politics and sticks with the swords and romance and humor. He also details some background information about his trip to Florin and the S. Morgenstern museum.The actual fabrication of these details and the earnestness with which he writes about them makes them believable and often had me scratching my head wondering. I imagine that Mr. Goldman had an enormously good time concocting his fictional life and details of S. Morgenstern.This book is funny!It is an easy read and has all the great elements of a great adventure. The addition of Buttercup's baby at the end was a wonderful surprise that left me wanting more."
5,Morgenstern's Genius,"Florinese wit at its finest, edited to the 'good parts' for modern audiences.A classic."
2,The Princess Bride 1st (first) edition Text Only,"I ordered and received a copy of The Princess Bride. It was represented to be a first edition which is why I bought it, yet it was not a first edition. It was published in 2003. The first edition was published in 1973, a thirty year difference.It was an excellent copy of a third edition."
3,There is No S. Morgernstern.,"The Princess Bride by William Goldman is okay though personally I think think the movie is better.BTW: I think it is totally hilarious that so many reviewers think that there really is an S. Morgenstern and don't understand that it was all created by William Goldman and that S. Morgernstern is not a real person.I will probably get unhelpful votes and called a liar like everyone else who has tried to educate people that S. Morgernstern is not real but oh well, whatever!"
3,Good Book But Avoid The Audio Recording! It's Like Nails Scratching Down On A Chalkborad!,I listened to the audio book recording of William Goldman's The Princess Bride and while I think the story itself is good I think the audio recording was awful! The man who did the reading did okay with the male voices but the female characters like Buttercup sounded harsh. Buttercup sounded like an old man trying to clear phlem out of his throat!I would advise people to read the paperback or hardcover book editions instead of listening to this horrible audio recording!
4,Cute.,"Very sweet, good read. I recommend this to everyone. It was easy to read and entertaining. It's got that sarcasm that makes the movie/book great."
5,My favorite novel of all-time!,"When people ask me what my favorite book is, this always tops the list. I loved the movie, but the book is so much better. The same type of humor, just much more of it. In comparison, the movie disappoints. Excellent book!"
5,A medieval melodrama,"This is one of my favorite books EVER! The first time I read it, I fell down laughing. The title does not adaquetly describe the book, although the back cover does try to remedy this. It is not so much a story about true love between Westley and Buttercup and the evil villain Prince Humperdink (what names!) as it is a catalogue of the rediculous held together by a stereotyped romantic drivel storyline. For me, the story line is carried along by the humor inherent in the novel. Situations are rediculous, people experiance impossible odds and miraculous saves, only to emerge victorious. This truly is the ""good parts"" version."
5,Great fun on many levels.,"William Goldman knows how to tell a story that is at once a marvelously funny spoof of the fantasy/adventure genre and a successful story in the genre itself. I first read this book in my youth, when it was initially released. I loved Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (screenplay by Goldman), and needed a good read. I got it. I have reread it and loaned it out so many times that my old first issue finally wore out. So I ordered a new one to share with my kids. Buttercup, Wesley, Inigo, Fezzik and Vizzini are memorable, each with his or her own story. A great book to read to kids, too."
1,its boring i dont care 4 fantasies,its soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring i almost fell asleep
1,Disappointment,"I loved the movie and the book for many years. However, I recently spent a vacation in Florin where I was given the priveledge of reading the full story. I tried the other night to read my old copy and have found the abridgement, as well as the commentary, annoying instead of wonderful, like previously thought. If you do get the book, make sure it is the original. It is so much better."
1,Get your money back!!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I loved the movie and thought that the book would be better, but I was seriously wrong. When they mean the abridged version, they were not kidding. I was informed that the original story is close to 1,000 pages and this book is probably less than 300 pages if you got rid of the author's commentary which hinders the story most of the time. The author took so much away from the book when he abridged it that I felt disappointed when I finished the book. I would never have bought the book if I knew that was how it was going to be. If you want to read the Princess Bride, try getting the original by S. Morgenstern."
5,One of my favorite books,"Definitely one of my favorite books, The Princess Bride is a welcome escape from most of the copy-cat fiction available today. The story is timeless, and the author's commentary is hilarious. Be sure to send for the free reunion scene offered in the middle of the book, it's greatly worth the stamp"
4,The Princess Bride is a good book.,"The Princess Bride by William Goldman is a truly remarkable book. At the beginning of the book you think, oh, this is just another fairy tale.But to tell you the truth, I thought this book had many twists. The vocabulary is strong so it's not just another quick and childish book. I think a lot of people would enjoy this book because it doesn't just focus on one genre. Some parts of the book could be romantic while other parts are action. I was never bored reading this book. For the most part, I was filled with suspense. The Princess Bride is a book that will make you think differently about fairy tales."
2,I really wish I liked this more...,"This one is so hard for me to review. This is one of my favorite stories of all time, but it's not the book that I'm in love with. It's the movie. I am utterly obsessed with the film adaptation of this novel. The novel itself, however, is just not my favorite. I want to like it. I truly do. But I just can't. It is too long and drawn out and the characters just get confusing. The story really needed to be pared down a little more before being published in my opinion. I'm so sad to give this a negative review, but I feel like I just have to. I really didn't enjoy the novel at all. But I HIGHLY recommend the movie!!! :)"
2,Disappointed,"I have to say I'm a bit disappointed by the book. I saw the movie first and then read the book. The fact that he jumps in all the time with this fake back story really bugs me, as well as a lot of continuity errors. I loved the movie, it's definitely one of the best of all time. Do yourself a favor and don't read the book, just watch the movie. (It's MILES better)"
3,Not your unusual fairytale,I loved the book's out-of-place contemporary anti fairy tale humor (this was before Shrek) and whole alternate reality thing that wraps up and intercepts the story. I even believed it without questions until I read about it on wiki (this was after wiki ;)Definitely enjoyable book that I could recommend (for example to the people that liked the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy). But it contains some parts that kinda dragged so three stars seems just about right.
3,Princess Bride a good book,I liked the part in the book when Wesley is a farm boy and Buttercups parents were always arguing about something or another and Buttercup never talked to anyone. She never kept herself clean and all she ever did was ride horse. That was a part that should have been in the movie but it was not.Another part in the book that was in the book that was not in the movie was the Zoo of Death with the five layers and all they had in the movie was the pit of dispare which was not all that exiting.The Albino went to go look for a wheelbarrel in the cart and in the movie he went to get a cart. The Albino helped wesley in the book and not the movie.When the Prince was chasing Wesley in the book he was rideing the white horses and in the movie he was riding some other horses.
4,Think beyond the love...,"It's great that people appreciate the book for what it is, but somehow I think there is more to it than true love and adventure. It's a satire, right? SO what is Goldman really saying about fairytales? Buttercup is as fickle as any, yet her ""true love"" is the type that can conquer death. It's about our ideals, what we have made them. I'm not saying you have to agree with me, I'd just like you to think about what Goldman is really saying about love."
5,You people are retarded.,"The book, The Princess Bride, is a wonderful book. It is my favorite story. However, did none of you notice that the book came out in 87, when the movie came out in 87 as well? The ""book"" was a screenplay first, then turned in to a book. Second: S. Morganstern NEVER existed. ""Why can't I find the 'first' addition of The Princess Bride?"" you ask yourself. It's because William Goldman wrote the whole story, and the history, give him the credit that is needed!"
4,The perfect book which gave birth to the perfect movie.,"I have no problem admiting that ""The Princess Bride"" is my favorite movie of all time. I was a little skepticle about reading the book because I didn't want to ruin my love for the movie. Boy, was I ever wrong.This book is just what the doctor ordered for any fan of the movie. It has all of the character background information that the movie lacks, not to mention continuing past the end of the movie....until the birth of Buttercup's Baby. It is true that the book is much darker than the movie (i.e. Pit of Dispare = Zoo of Death), but it's not distasteful. After finishing the book, I put it away with a new love for the story, but I did not loose any love for the movie since it is so different in mood and detail that the book.I have read the book a few times now and every time I do, I then immediately watch the movie with equal zest. The book is a fabulous read for anyone with a passion for a great story."
3,a review in disappointment,"As much as I truly love the story, I can't reread it often. The actual bits of story are delightful and inspired, with brilliant humour and heart-pounding action. It's not the story itself, or the writing style that I have a problem with- it's the author's endless injections.He goes on, sometimes for a page and a half in places, at times just when you were getting into the story, or during the action. And all he ever does is whine. I'm quite tired of hearing about his loveless marriage and fat son. And that's not the worst of it. The worst is his condescending ""life's not fair"" speeches EVERY TIME he has to butt in. He gets incredibly preachy, and it's frustrating. After reading it, I felt kind of cheated. The story is so wonderful, and his interruptions ruin it for me. If the made a version without, the whole thing would be much improved."
3,Princess Bride is a love novel and a fairy tale,"In the movie they left out the Zoo of death which would have made the video a whole lot better, because they would have seen how good prince humperdinck was of a tracker and the pit of despair was just to dull. The albino in the movie got knocked out and didnt help Inigo and Fezzik which didnt give any credit to the albino because he was always trying to help westley. prince humperdinck should have been a fat man with a bad temper and always looked mad because in the movie he was not fat and was not mad all the time."
4,Great book but the kindle edition needs some work.,"This is a review of the Kindle version of this novel. The story itself is just as fun as the movie, though I could have done without the asides from the author or his long and completely fictitious prologue describing his discovery of the novel and visit to the fake museum. The kindle version of this book does not have chapter markers at all. There's only something like 7 or so chapters but it is a handy feature to have when trying to find specific parts of the story and the lack of them in this book given the previously mentioned long (and in my opinion uninteresting) prologue made it a challenge to navigate to the first chapter to begin the actual story.To clarify the story is a 5, but this digital copy is a 4."
5,Great Read!,"I was so excited to see ""The Princess Bride"" has been made available on kindle,I read this years ago and without a doubt one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. Can't wait to get started."
4,GREAT... but ....,"I honestly loved the story line, i think it is the best plot in the world, but it can be written so much better. We could have had more on the settings as in the descriptions. The way Mr. Goldman had his italics bits were fine but it seems so strange with all the action (actually they could have done more to the action too) going on and suddenly say something rather inappropriate. The main problem was all the missing descriptions. From beginning till end I didn't find out anything about Westly's eyes except for that they were the ""color of the sea before a storm"", and anything about Buttercup's hair but the ""color of Autumn"". I mean, where's the imagination? I still love the story but if I were to write it I feel I could do so much better."
4,Not as good as the movie,"This book is interesting, and is recommended if one has not seen the movie, but unlike most books, it is not better than the movie. Much of the movie comes straight from the book, and no imagination can come up with a better giant than Andre the Giant. The parts of the book that deal with the same events as in the movie, but differ in details, are inferior to the portrayal of the events in the movie.The book certainly is humorous, but the constant interuptions of Goldman discussing the fictional Morgenstern get old quickly. Maybe some people find this great, but in my opinion, it just takes away from the story.Still, the book contains a lot to holds one's interest. It deals with pirates, dueling, torture, love, and many other things. It is full of action."
4,"Goldman's life story, and a bit of a good book","Well, the story of the Princess Bride was wonderful! It was such an amusing plotline, interesting characters, such humour and wit, and I suspect Morgenstern was quite brilliant with the political savvy behind it all. But I just really enjoyed the cover story. However, from the little bits and pieces I could distinguish there was some interesting parts that Mr. Goldman left out. I understand he did us all a favour by cutting out all that rabble about Florinese royalty and humour, but when he casually adds that he cut out Westley's history and reasons why Max was cast out... that was irritating. I felt the Princess Bride was enchanting, but Mr. Goldman used the book more as an ego trip. He did more talking about himself, and his life, and all his griefs, and how HE personally made his son into the successful hunk he now is. Hmm. If there was less Mr. Goldman, and just the Princess Bride, I would have appreciated the book more."
1,"Don't bother,","I am glad I checked it out of the library and did not pay for. I read the abridged version, but really don't think it made a difference. The book was choppy, but long at the same time. This version used so much of the book's pages to self promote Goldman (I skipped most of it) and his new Buttercup's Baby. I agree with the others, watch to movie, don't read the book. It's a waste of time."
2,to book or movie that is the question,"I like the book better than the movie personaly, because the book has such things as Zoo-of-Death. The albino in the moive the got clubbed over the head and did nothen else, but in the book the albino showed them the way and gave them his wheelbarolw. the only good part of the movie i though was that the maricle man was played by Billy Crystal, and his wife (The witch) was really really scary looking. On the cliffs of insanity the horses weren't white like they were suppose to be and Prince Humperdink wasn't a big masculine guy like in the book he was and could switch horses wile he was riding so no one horse had to bear all of his weight all the way through the ride. In the movie the albino was pushing a ""hand-cart"" , wile in the book he had a ""Wheelbarrol"". Again i felt that the book was ALOT better than the movie. In the movie Westly wasn't very well played amd look alittle ""odd""."
3,Just see the movie....,"I read this book because I was a GREAT fan of the movie and I always thought the books were better than the movies. But this book proved me wrong. Better just to stick to the movie and enjoy that. They definetly made the movie more exciting. Plus in this book Buttercup didn't even love Westley at first! She suddenly fell deeply in love with him because she became jealous that the Countess loved him! Well anyway if you do decide to read the book, it explains in much more detail about some parts in the book (Like that Vizzini was hired by Humperdinck to kill Buttercup and all that stuff). All in all....stick to the movie!!"
2,Not good at all,"I feel very cold towards Mr. Goldman, because now that he's made the abridgement, I can't seem to find an original copy anywhere, and most of the information he left out could have been very important to me. Even if he cut down 1,000 pages to 300, he left out some parts I would have enjoyed reading, for example, I am interested in medieval etiquette, and can rarely find that without at least one hundred pages I'm not interested in."
1,I am not amused . . . . .,"I was expecting to read the book ""The Princess Bride"", not visit some egomaniac's playground.I didn't know I would have to wade thru (actually, skip over...) nearly 100 pages of ""foreword"" to even GET to the book, & then dodge all the ""excerpt"" explanations. Which, by the way, don't help, all they do is interrupt the flow.No, I'm not a ""movie"" type of person, I would much rather read a book than watch a movie. But in this instance I will make an exception, watch the film & forget the book . . . . ."
5,Charming,"It's hard to read ""Princess Bride"" without thinking of the wonderful movie adaptation of the book. But the movie just enhances the experience of the absolutely charming book.It's a classic adventure-and-love story. The most beautiful woman in the world, the strongest man in the world, the best sword-fighter in the world, the most fearsom pirate in the world, the world's greatest torturer, and the world's greatest hunter. And the world's deepest love.It's fun and funny in many parts, with sly asides about that mock the conventions of the adventure story. But it also has pathos, especially during the numerous interruptions that bedevil the ultimate lovers Buttercup and Westley and during Westley's torture.Finally, it's a book for almost all ages -- just as is claimed in the wrapping story that frames the book. It can be read to a 10-year-old, enjoyed by a high schooler, and zipped through by an adult."
2,A mess of a story about a fairy tale,"This was a story about a story; however, both present and the past were not consistent. I don't understand the high ratings. I never saw the movie and didn't like the missing parts of the present author. The fairy tale had too many happy endings and the very end was very confusing."
5,Classic,Princess Bride - one of the best movies and books of ALL TIME.ONLY fault: William Goldman has this weird third voice threading throughout the story meanwhile being the pseudonym of CS Morgenstern. I don't know if its annoying or the insanity of genius.
5,Engaging and entertaining,"This book is a whimsical take on the Fantasy genre that is thoroughly enjoyable. Don't be turned away by the fact that it's not too serious, because the narrative will have you hooked right from the beginning. It somehow managed to be enthralling even though there is a tongue firmly in the writers cheek. I don't imagine this is a simple task! If you're a fantasy fan who's like more of the funny, then tryThe Colour Of Magic (Discworld Novels), but if you want something that's serious but still with a gripping story, tryInto The Trees."
5,An excellent book,"This book was simply wonderful, I devoured it in a single day. The book never had a dull moment and the snappy comments from William Goldman only made it funnier. One of the best books I've ever read, and I've read alot!"
5,An all time favorite!,"This is one of my all-time favorite. Unfortunately maybe I'll never know the entirety of what Mr. Goldman left out, but even so it's a wonderful book. I have yet to read a book as clever or entertaining in this light hearted manner. Lastly, it blows the movie away (even though Mr. Elwes made a delicious Wesley)."
5,"A classic, one to keep and treasure","This is one of the most amazing books you'll ever lay hands on. Read it through once, and you've only got half the effect. Then sit down and read it to a child or loved one (Leaving out the asides, just like the movie ;) to get the best of it. This is one that will picked up and dusted off many times, and given away as a beloved gift more than once."
5,Read This Book!!!,"There are three great books/types of books in this world: The Bible, anything by C.S. Lewis, and The Princess Bride. For all of you interested in buying this book, I'm going to try and make your decision easy. I've read the book several times and seen the movie at least 14 times. I've forced all of my friends to watch the movie. I quote the book at least once a day (usually more). Everyone who has heard the story of The Princess Bride loves it. There's somethign in it for everyone, from comedy to romance to action and adventure to drama to a tiny bit of gore. As the title page claims, it is truely a ""Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure"". If you read this book, I guarantee that you'll love it-- and the movie is just as good, maybe even better."
5,The funniest book I have read,"In The Princess Bride,Goldman makes fun of all the fairy tales and adventure stories about beautiful princesses and white knights ever written.By the end,my face hurt from laughing so much."
5,Best Book I've Read,"This book was absolutely amazing. I had seen the movie and wanted to read the book to see if it compared. ""The Princess Bride"" truly is a Classic Tale of Love and High Adventure!"
2,Awful,"I LOVED the movie, but didn't like the book much. I read the book several years ago and wouldn't waste my time on reading it again! The writer makes Buttercup sooooooo stupid that it was really annoying. There are only a couple movies where I would say the movie is way better than the book, this one and Forrest Gump! Don't waste your time on it there are many other great books out there to read."
2,Abridged,"The story was great. I would give it a five star rating. But it was abridged, and the abridger tried to make the book his own. He kept poping in here and there throughout the book to explain why he cut certain parts of the story. But the worst part was that he was also telling his own story at the same time. He claimed that his father read The Princess Bride to him whenever he was sick. Anyone who has watched the movie will immediately see that his story is the same exact one as the boy in the movie's story. Even most of the dialogue is copied from the movie. Another thing the abridger did was tell the story how his father read it to him, which was wrong most of the time, and then explain why his father told it that way, and then he would put the correct version in. It got very confusing. I did not enjoy this book that much. Keep your money and buy an unabridged version."
3,Princess Bride,"I thought the book I purchased was a used book, but I do not believe it was, I believe it was damaged during production or shipping.The binding was ripped and the book is permenantly bent or concave.Definitely readable, and I would purchase from the ""used"" again. I just prefer the used to look worn not misfigured."
2,Stick to the movie for the classic tale,"Oh man, was I disappointed when I received this. First of all, the author who has abridged the story will not shut up during the story telling, he's constantly interrupting with his comments, that, while vaguely amusing about ten percent of the time, are just rude interruptions in a story. I, for one of the first times in my life, prefer the movie over the book. If only I could rip out the portions where the abridging author interrupts the original author and have that abridged uninterrupted version, then I would be happy."
3,The movie is the 'good parts' version,"The book is Ok but has some major problems that the movieavoids. The biggest problem is the author putting too muchpersonal information in. Skip both introductions, they dolittle but detract from the book. There is a little bit onpages XI - XIV about the cast for the movie that is interestingbut by all means skip the rest.Many of the author's comments in the book (the italic text) canalso be skipped, though it is not as bad as the introductions.You can skip the comments on pages 41, 171, 206, 247 and 316.You may want to read them on pages 65, 73, 83, 195, 197, 281 and96.The movie is great, the book less so. One day I may edit itand create my own 'best parts' version.Ken"
3,Mixed Feelings,"If you enjoyed the film, the novel is worth a read. It's a cute story. The characters are endearing and the narration does a lovely job of poking fun at itself (and its genre.) My only complaint -- and unfortunately it's a big one -- is that by the end of the book, I was sick to death of Goldman's interruptions! I ended up skipping large chunks of the last few chapters only to reach an ending which, in my opinion, doesn't hold a candle to the ending of the film. The whole thing's a bit of a letdown, but you could do worse on a rainy afternoon."
2,Good book,"William Goldman did way better with the screenplay for the movie. This book was actually pretty bad except for die-hard fans of the movie, who might want to see where movie came from. It's hard to believe the same man wrote both the book and the screen play."
3,Ok Fairy Tale Book of True Love,"I had a hard time emotionally engaging in this book. It is mainly a frenetic joke that speeds rapidly by. I love Rob Reiner as a director and William Goldman is one of my favorite screenwriters. I just didn't love this book. I have always liked the movie, not loved it but thought the book would be better. It just isn't for me."
3,after all the wait...the movie was better,"For the first time ever, I feel the movie was better. The author interrupts constantly with comments that bring you out of the story and it is not as ""charming"" as it plays out on the screen. Did not make it till the end--despite that this movie was a ""cult classic"" for my generation/age group."
5,something to remind you not to take life so seriously,"Hey to all you readers who look for a good laugh and a scheme of passion, romance, giants, chases, escapes, true love, and of course miracles. I could not recommend a better book for this. Mind you, the humor is dry, so don't expect to be immediately hysterical. Overall, this book has always been my favorite fairy tale since the 5th grade and even if you have already seen the movie, the book is twice as fantastic."
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent",For anyone who has ever had dreams about being a princess or a pirate or a prince..you have to read this book. It is both hilarious and dramatic at the same time. You turn the pages faster and faster as you get deeper into the book. Does Buttercup marry Humperdinck or does the man in black save her? What about Inigo and Fezzik? What happens next is all you can think about. William Goldman has done an excellent job creating or abridging(Which is it???) The Princess Bride!! Read this book!!
5,30th Anniversary Edition,"This book is an abridged version of the original Morgenstern novel (ie all the good bits none of the boring stuff) It is exactly like the movie we all know and love. So glad I bought it - now my kids can grow up with it too. Brilliant, pageturning novel"
3,The Princess Bride,"I feel so grumpy for saying it, but...the book was just okay. The movie was definitely better. And I really hope thast Goldman is nothing like he portrays himself in the book--I found that character really distasteful.Nothing wrong with the book, it was just very average."
5,Even better than the movie!,"I have to admit, I only read this book because I loved the movie so much. The book is just as wonderful as the movie, but with more to it! It was funny and adventurous and epic! In addition to Wesley's and Buttercup's story, I was also drawn to the author's notes throughout the book. At first, I just skimmed past them not really interested in them but not bothered by them either. By the end of the book, Mr. Goldman had become his own character. I cared about him and his story as well. It was like two great books in one. Love this book."
2,"I liked the real book, but the abridgement leaves stuff out.","The actual book is good, but I think the abridgement leaves out too much. I understood what was going on, but the book could have been much more interesting if few or no passages were removed."
2,Not really...,"I loved the princess bride. I liked the movie and I own the book. I loved the book so much I got it on my kindle too. But, being the idiot that I am, I didn't look at the authors name. So I started reading it and found this guys biography. Well fine, I thought, just a little authors note, so I just skipped past it. I read on. Suddenly I found an APOLOGY for the little notes found in the parentheses. I knew the original. I knew these notes were more then authors note, it is this guys personal biography written into the story! I think it absolutely ruins the story. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is such a great story."
2,The Princess Bride by William Goldman,"I was very disappointed in this book. William Goldman totally ruined it for me. He opens with 31 pages of a long, boring, rambling, collection of his comments about the Princess Bride story. Additionally he gives a page of his ridiculous comments at the beginning of each chapter. He really ruined the story of the Princess Bride for me. I would never have bought this book if I had known this edition was about William Goldman and The Princess Bride is treated as a side story."
3,"Sweet, but not really something meant for the eternity","A cute and funny parody, something you would definitely buy for your kids, but not really the classic most reviews claim it to be!"
3,it was good but could've been better.,"the book was very good, the only problem with it was every time that William Goldman interupted and was babaling about his life and giving comentary it got boring when i was reading the intro...30 pages. you may think that he was talking trash about his son and wife, but then again he could be lying and making things up because he was lying about S. Morgenstern."
2,"Okay, but wasn't memorable","I know many people will terrorize our neighborhoods for saying this, but it wasn't the number one book we have ever read. Sure it was okay but it was predictable and shallow. The characters weren't endearing. So we could care less about them.This book is a mockery of romance, adventure and drama. But if you like parodies you have our blessing dive right in. Don't waste your money, borrow it."
2,Kindle Edition is uglier than a sack of dead cats.,"I just purchased the Kindle edition of the book. Unfortunately, it is in Amazon's execrable ""Topaz"" format, which means that it essentially looks like an ugly, pixellated scan of a paperback. No antialiasing, no font smoothing, and terribly, hideously ugly.In other words, avoid the Kindle Edition of this book as if it had head lice, and the head lice were themselves infested with fleas that carried the bubonic plague and which, after giving you the plague, jumped into your food and pooped on it."
5,"Romance, Adventure, And A Laugh","I actually read this book after seeing the movie, and I felt a little guilty for not reading it, so I signed it out. I was amazed. The only bad part is (and here I consult the paperback book) twenty nine pages about his love for the book. I think W.Goldman may have been an utter nutcase, but his good-parts-version is helpful because Morgenstern has the tendency to babble on. In these places, the extracted part is explained, so you don't miss anything. PS. If Florin is a real country, please tell me in a review. He makes it sound so real!"
2,Far From What I Saw On Screen,This book is entirely different than what i watched the movie yet honestly i read this book and i didnt like it.
3,my love has faded in time.,"The first time I read this book, I loved it, fullstop. The second time I read it, I was pretty angry about being tricked, but it was still awesome. Reading it all these years later as an adult, I noticed how sexist, racist, and lazy this book is. Don't get me wrong- enough of it is still entertaining that I didn't try to set my copy on fire, but it's not nearly as good as I remember it being."
5,Revenge,"I've read the other reviews and what no one seems to have commented on is the main theme of revenge - from Buttercup's parents' insults to Mad Max creating humiliations galore for Prince Humperdink, and everything in between. The dread pirate Robert's ship and of course, Inigo. Everyone seems to want it at one point in time or another, a payback and yet there is always the theme that life isn't fair, and that anyone telling you different is selling something. Anyone wishing for more information on The Princess Bride should check out the screenplay - I read it in a book of 4 or 5 screenplays of William Goldman's - including Misery, and Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. It explains how and why he wrote The Princess Bride the way he did. Also, I've heard that there will be a twenty-fifth anniversary edition coming out this December - hard cover. Have fun storming the Castle!"
5,If I had voted for the top 100 books . . .,"I own two copies of this book, one of them to keep, and one to lend out. I should probably demand some sort of kickback from Mr. Goldman, I've converted so many friends and relatives into Princess Bride fans. This book is unimaginably enjoyable, it's witty, magical, touching, and did I mention witty? A testament to the cleverness of the book is the amazing number of people who have reviewed it here that still believe S.Morgenstern's original exists. I think that explains any less than gushing reviews. They missed out on much of the delightful tongue-in-cheek humor that characterizes William Goldman. In my opinion, the italicized 'editor's notes' are a delicious addition to a timeless and truly entertaining tale. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!"
5,Have Kleenex on hand ....,"Sure, I'm the type who loves all sorts of books, and yeah,I cry in a lot of them. But usually when I read them a second time.... I just don't. Not with this book! I have read it about 10 times (yes, it's that good!) and I still end up in tears everytime! Read it and find out yourself!"
5,i've read it 9 times,"Mr Goldman wrote an absolutly divine tale when he shared with us the tale of Buttercup and Wesley's true love [& mammoth misunderstandings,titanic troubles and beastly betrayals]. If one loves the extremes of good and evil and the triumph of niceness over badness [well sort of] and the gratuitous use of parenthesis then this book was written for you. Adjectives that apply are many; humourous, exciting, suspenseful, witty, compelling, witty, fun, engaging, accessable, witty and just terribly good. This is such a jolly good book I belive that anyone who has a chance should read it, talk about it, quote freely from it, read it again and then bore people by insisting that this book is sooooo good that they simply must read it."
5,GREAT HONK!!!!,"I have read this book twice in the last 5 days!!!! I absolutly LOVE it. i don't usually like love storys, but this one rules!!!! I would give 1,000,000 satars if I could!!!"
5,Absolutly a Wonderfull Treasure!!!,"I adore this Wonderful, Brilliant, Beautiful, classic tale. It is a book that I will treasure for years. A book that I will read over and over again. Please I beg of you, do yourself a favor and read this great book."
5,GREAT! It's now a family tradition to see the movie!,"I love this book! Especially the movie though. Ever since my mom showed me it, I can't live a month without watching it! We both have every scene memorized, and NEVER get tired of it I recommend this movie to everyone! It could have a bit less language, but either way, it's the number one rated movie of my life!"
2,Princess Bride,"Who knew the movie is sooooooo much better than this book. I was sadly disappointed when I read it. It does resemble the movie, but I actually skipped over the parts where Goldman digresses when telling the tale. It was not the same way Peter Falk digressed, and for this reason, the print version left me cold. I know some of the reviews loved it, check and you will see others feel like I do. If I read this book first, I doubt if I would see the movie. So, for those of you who have not read book or seen the wonderful movie, skip the book, rent the flick."
4,Princess Bride,"Although the language is stilted and the situations tend to be somewhat hokey, the story is a timeless classic. I would recommend reading the book first, then watching the movie. If you watch the movie first, the book moves too slow."
3,Rather bizarre but likeable,"An adult fairy tale which is to say: totally unbelievable but enjoyable and somewhat reminiscent of Shrek. If you liked Shrek, you're likely to enjoy this."
3,Loved the movie,I could not get into this book but I have watched the movie on DVD at least 20 times. Go figure.
5,Modern Classic,I shouldnt' have waited so long to read this book. The movie makes more sense now and I already enjoyed the movie. I can't wait to read it to my son. Definitely one we'll read multiple times. LOVED it! The kindle edition was perfect.
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"My 8th grade summer reading list, I knew, wasn't very exciting. There were some really boring books on there! I chose carefully which books sounded O.K. or good, and I read the ones that I chose. The Princess Bride by William Goldman was amazing. Even though it is over 300 pages, I read that book in one day. I just couldn't put it down! All the twists and turns were so unexpected and exciting. It is a story about true love-- finding it, wanting it, losing it... all the characters are so colorful. You just can't resist reading on. I really recommend this from ages 10 and older. Adults, I'm sure you will love this book too. If you get the 25th Anniversary edition, you can ever read the first chapter of its long-lost sequel, Buttercup's Baby. Enjoy!"
3,Story is good. Literary device detracts.,"The story itself is a good one. Everything in the movie and more. It actually explained a thing or two that the movie was unclear on.The ""literary device"" of the fictional S. Morgenstern, and the fictional missing chapter, and the fictional tale of the author detracted from the story, for me. Luckily he put all that ""stuff"" in italics and it was fairly easy to skip around. However, you had to bypass 50-60 pages at the beginning just to get to the story. Then there is more scattered throughout the chapter. The ending ""after the ending"" had a lot more to wade through. Easily 100 pages were wasted on me.I hope others enjoy the ""literary device"".Regardless, the story itself is very worth reading."
5,Book club,"My neighborhood book club read for November. I enjoyed reading it, I saw the movie in the theater many years ago."
3,The movie is better!,It's so slow going it's inconceivable! Too many asides which are distracting. Rent the movie and sit back and enjoy.
5,This book was not abridged......,"I just found out that this book was not abridged. Rather, William Goldman wrote the whole thing and pretended to abridge it. I'm not sure if this is true or not, but for all people who want to get the full version, you're out of luck!"
4,the movie was good; this is better,"I usually find that if I read the book first, I like that better, but if I saw the movie first, I like that better. Well, with this one I saw the movie first, and liked it -- why else would I read the book? -- but I like the book better anyway. There's a lot of jokes in the movie that just work better in writing, or jokes that are in the book and had to be left out of the movie.The book is totally funny. Both parts, the story of the princess bride and the ""annotations,"" had me laughing out loud. And where if this were supposed to be a serious novel, the kind of hurried backstories given to many of the characters might be a little alienating, here they're perfect, because they do convey the feeling of having been condensed out of something much longer. This book is just a pleasure to read throughout."
5,"Always an adventure,the first time or the fiftieth","In my short life, I have not found another book that can capture ones imagination. The perfectly woven tapestry of details and adventure keep you on the edge of your. . .seat! I have given it is as a gift, and my friend rewarded me by saying it was the best gift they had ever received. I can only say ""Thank you"" to the authors."
3,"Ivanhoe meets ""This is Spinal Tap""","An enjoyable read, with Goldman twisting the format of the novel into something beyond satire. Reading the other reviews AFTER reading the novel has been great fun(Reminds me of the first time I saw Rob Reiner's movie, THIS IS SPINAL TAP, and half the audience thought it was a real rock documentary!). In the end, however, I was more interested in Goldman's voice than the ""Morgenstern"" story. And I thought that Buttercup was vapid."
3,It's ok but works better on film,"This is a by the numbers story that works at times but never lives up to the adventure and romance it wants to deliver. Maybe, in a way, that is the point. I don't know. I love the film and the eccentric characters. I just think the novel reads more like a screenplay with very little emotional depth to any of the characters. I'm glad I read it because there are some good lines of dialogue. But this is hardly a 'classic'."
3,MIsleading,"I purchased this book as a family book. The main book is, but there is another section at the end, entitled ""Buttercup's Baby"", which is NOT suitable for families. There was NO indication of this in any of the information given on the website. I was not pleased with this. I can do this book as a family read-aloud, but will not be able to put it out for my children to read on their own. I would appreciate it if Amazon gave complete information regarding products."
3,Too many interruptions!,"I love the movie and decided to give the book a try. Sorry, but the movie is better.Sure the book clarifies some things that the movie skipped over. And the whole Morgenstern was clever and made me chuckle once I figured it out.However, the author's interjections became more than a bit annoying. I read the 20th edition so the first like 50-100 pages were the author's comments or set up. I skipped most of this. The ""teaser chapter"" at the end, ""Buttercup's Baby,"" was a bit boring... sorry!"
4,"Great story, questionable reading.","I'm a fan of Rob Reiner's work, but his reading of this classic leaves quite a bit to be desired, in my opinion. He reads too fast and with little differing inflection, making it difficult at times to tell when he ends one character's line and starts another. This fantasy would have benefitted from a voice that could handle multiple characters and perhaps someday we'll even get a version with a full cast and music.Still, it's clearly a story that means a lot to him and to its listeners and readers, so his pace and reading style don't entirely distract from the experience...a very worthwhile purchase."
5,Indeed the missing manual,"Why software cannot come with good manuals anymore is a mystery. This is exactly as advertised, the missing manual. Some other books will show you how to build bigger, more sophisticated solutions, but this one covers every aspect of how Filemaker works, which is what a manual should do.Oh, and by the way, Filemaker is an amazing, underappreciated tool which helps manage a mailing list or build an entire database system. You cannot go wrong with it."
2,FileMaker Pro8,"Touted as the ""missing manual"" I was expecting good guidance on concrete applications. I bought the software with the primary intent of converting various large Excel files into a database. The manual is large on theory and small on concrete help. My efforts to convert Excel files failed so often that I finally gave up trying. The book was of no help."
1,They canceled my order!,"These guys had Amazon cancel the order, stating that they were out of stock on grey (charcoal) large size jackets. However, right now and everytime since the cancelation, they state they have 2 left in stock! What the heck is this crap? Completely unprofessional. I ordered patches for this jacket once the order went through, so now I have patches and no coat. Completely unacceptable. Order yours somewhere reliable, not from these creeps.!"
3,Great jacket but listen to the reviews because it does run too small,The lining makes this a light and heavyduty jacket for cool to cold weather. I did not listen to the reviews and wish I did because I ordered a XL and had to retrun it for an XXL. The waist and arms tend to rise up like if you are wearing a coat too small to fit.
4,Nice,"Well made jacket. Rugged, fits well, insulated without weight. My husband was very pleased with it. This was a hit."
3,Busted Zipper After First Wash,"I had this for a few months, and yesterday I washed it for the first time in the washing machine. The instructions--that aren't in English, but I can read Spanish--on the tag recommend to wash the jacket this way. Anyway, after the cycle was done, the zipper track was missing a few teeth and the zipper pull was ripped off. I left the jacket unzipped when I threw it in the wash, but that's how I've washed all jackets in the past and never once had this problem.For a company that makes heavy duty clothing, I thought the zipper should have been able to survive at least one wash cycle.To replace a zipper track and zipper pull is going to cost me about $30 and at least two-weeks of waiting at a tailor. I'm probably going to buy a new Eisenhower and donate my old one to charity.So, either get this jacket dry cleaned, don't wash it, or take the chance and wash it with the zipper zipped."
3,meh,the movie wasnt very good but the product itself was in really good conditions the picturend sound quality was ok. dvd works as intended
3,An acceptable but not great comedy,"This dark comedy was enjoyable but not great. The main character was a bit annoying, and a bit of an idiot, and the story got somewhat silly at times."
2,comedy,"I loved Martin Clunes in the ""Doc Martin"" series. I wanted to see what else he had done. This series was OK, but I wouldn't buy the sequel. He has such an expressive face."
4,turn of the century fun,"ok i'll admit this music is perhaps an acquired taste. when i bought this cd, 8 years ago at 14 years of age, i thought whta is this? but then i listened and i really started to like it. its like living history on a disc. i love the song ""in my merry oldsmobile"" by period great billy murray.it takes you back to the beguinning era of automobiles. a song by john philip sousas's band ( the original one) in the good old summer time. its great! This disc also includes Enrico caruso doing his stunning version of ""over there"". that song jumped out at me the first time i listened to it. then there are amusing songs like ada jones' ""the yama yama man"". great vintage music. seriously try it out"
3,Saint Saga #16,"This full-length Saint adventure finds Simon in search of sunken treasure — or rather, in search of people in search of it.The background to the story is impeccably set up. The breadth of Charteris's knowledge was astonishing: there is even a passing reference to verifying Wegener's Theory of Continental Drift, which at that point (1936) had collected nothing but ridicule.In terms of continuity there are several references to earlier Saintly adventures, Orace figures prominently, and Roger Conway and Peter Quentin join in.Nevertheless, I like this book much less than other Saint stories of the same period. But I'm not sure why, unless it's the predictability of the plot and the ordinariness of the heroine. Perhaps there just isn't as much fun in it.So only three stars, for me. Your mileage may differ.P.S. For a list of — and discussion of — all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."
2,Not for version 4.5!,"The biggest problem with this book is that it is written for version 4.0. Because of all the changes that were made to version 4.5, especially in the area of Internet connectivity, this book is not all that helpful and I wasted my money on it."
1,The worst computer book if wriitten,Save your money for something worthwhile. The book reads like a warning label. Half the book tells you not to adjust the settings. If your buying the book to learn how to configure MBSBS you will be very disappointed.
1,I only wish I could have chosen 0 stars,If you are looking for some insights into the details of SBS you need to look elsewhere. They spend more time telling you not to change a particular setting instead of explaining the setting.
1,No better than what the software tells you,"If you expect this book to explain what the software documentation doesn't, forget it. This book gives no more information than does the Start Here Manual and the Online Guide included with Small Business Server. This book just uses three times as many words. Small Business Server does not live up to its promise of ease of setup and ease of use, nor is this book of any help."
5,Will catch your breath!,"This is a very unusual film from Hong Kong / Canadian filmmaker Kenneth Bi. As with the drumming beats, it speeds up and thrills you and then slows down and falls into the reflective mood. A well-balanced genre mix with a very captivating plot.The rebellious son of a controlling boss in Hong Kong, has to flee to Taiwan upon enraging his father's adversary. Hiding out in the mountains, Sid encounters a group of Zen drummers whose mesmerizing art attracts the young man and encourages him to join the group. A twist of fate awaits him back home in Hong Kong and forces him to choose between loyalty to his family and his new found faith in himself."
3,Interesting,"Although I found this movie quite interesting, I don't think it's a movie for everyone. I'm interested in Asian drumming and Eastern spiritual practices. So, this movie makes sense for me... but most likely not for a lot of other people."
4,I liked it,I liked it (didn't want to write a review; just wanted to give it four stars; Amazon forces a twenty-word review).
2,Overrated,This movie just didn't move me like it did others.I thought it was boring and to long.It took me 2 sittings to finish it.I had high hopes for this movie hearing all the good reviews and I really wanted to see it because Jackie Chan's son was in it but unlike his father he has no screen presence.I think that it wasn't for Jaycee being Jackie's son I don't think this movie would have gotten such rave reviews.If I could I would have gave it 2 and a half stars.Overall I thought this movie was overrated but you might like it since it seems I am in the minority.
5,A rare gem,"With all the hollow movies being churning out of Hollywood's bad taste cookie cutter, this movie is a wonderful gift to the art of directing and acting along with the ""way of life"". Highly recommended to those who like to travel off the beaten path to find meaningful movies enriching our lives. Enjoy!"
3,Table and chair cover,The picture shows 3 chairs and a cover for a bistro set including table.I have only 2 chairs and a bistro table and the cover does not cover the set as in the picture.
1,Terrible. Lasted one year before needing to be replaced.,"This cover looks nice when new, but is not durable at all. I've had mine just about a year, and it is ready for the trash bin. The color has completely faded, and it is brittle and tears with the slightest contact.This is not a good product. A cover for outdoor should not need to be replaced annually."
2,"Too big, too small.","Although the quality is good, there was no mention of the actual size of this cover. I'm only able to put it over the table, for which it is too big but not over the table with the chairs around it as it was intended to be used. So now I just have a too big cover over the table and nothing to protect the chairs."
3,"Good, not great","Good product, shipped fast. However the product did not hold well in wind and exposed furniture to rain - it needs a good fastening system."
4,Cover--Limited Life,This cover is a good deal. It will last one--maybe two years but does protect the table and chairs.
2,Hearth & Garden Table Cover,PROS: Material works for weather proofing & it has vents to prevent it blowing up like a balloon and it fit over my stuff.CONS: Drawstring on bottom doesn't work - or at least 4 intelligent adults couldn't figure it out. We just set the furniture on the edges since it was big enough.Would I buy again - not at this price but it worked for this winter. I'll keep this for a couple of years but am still looking for one that really fits.
3,It was ok. Not particularly heavy duty but it got the job done,Like the title says. This was ok. Maybe I was under the impression that this was heavy duty because it is listed as direct burial but it was just a reasonably well made cable with the right kind of sheathing for burial. Nothing fancy or particularly hardy. You can probably find this cable at your local home improvement store for around the same price.
4,Cracking,This is DnB as I remember it.The intro track is sensational.This is not 'la de da' drum and bass - this is scream at the top of your lungs and break something drum and bass.
3,interesting but many errors,"This book is very interesting, probably my favorate of this series. However, there are many errors (I found 4 within the first 50 pages). For example, he states that in the sun one reaction that occurs is four hydrogens combining to form one helium, 4H --> He. This is obviously incorrect because it only takes 2 hydrogens to make a helium. This book is meant for young readers, and my concern is young readers getting misinformed on what could be an enriching extension for chemistry."
2,Sick of Sequels?,"If you loved Mermaid Ave. the first time around, then don't spoil it by buying the mediocre follow up. The first album, an unlikely but successful collaborative effort between Wilco and Billy Bragg, rekindled the words of Guthrie with music that ranged from whimsical pop to somber narratives, and they always delivered. However, this album felt very much like the scraps on the cutting room floor. Don't bother, the first album said well what needed to be said."
4,Great overall,"Excellent album; would have preferred more with Billy Bragg as lead vocals, but ah well. Solid overall. Too bad the two best songs - ""I Was Born"" (with Natalie Merchant (?)) and ""Flying Saucer"" are the shortest - 1:52 and 1:48, respectively."
4,Pretty good,"I liked all the Wilco songs, but Billy Bragg wasn't all that great. The former still makes it a worthwhile purchase. Interestingly, a lot of Intellectually Important Music Critics feel that Wilco doesn't do the songs right - that they don't sound like Woody Guthrie songs - whereas Bragg is true to the material. Whatever. Jeff Tweedy sings great on this album."
3,"What did you expect, it's a sequel!","Of course it's not as good as the first. They took the best material they had and used it on Volume 1. Well, mostly. Somehow they left behind ""Remember the Mountain Bed,"" a wistful song with a fairy-tale quality; ""Joe Dimaggio's Done It Again,"" a rollicking period piece; and ""Feed Of Man,"" which I'm still a little puzzled by, but in a good way. I just noticed that the three songs I've mentioned are all sung by Jeff Tweedy. That may be a coincidence, but he does seem to take the reins of this project over from Billy Bragg. Bragg fans needn't worry, though; it's all about the lyrics, and the legacy of the greatest folksinger ever."
5,Awesome training spurs,"I purchased these spurs for a horse that had never had them used on him. They are the perfect spurs to teach a horse what this new aid means. Gave just enough push, without making him crazy. HIGHLY recommended."
5,Easy to install and Works great,"I was a bit tentative that something that fits 3 different kinds of pipes would work well. I Install this on the cold water inlet on my water heater to keep the recirculation loop from backfeeding into the cold through a shower valve. I had the water drained for some other work I was doing and saved this for last. I did have to look up how far the pipe pushes into the fittign (which is 1"") and then marked that, cut and de-burred the pipe and it pushed on with a little muscle.I turned the water back on it works like a charm. No leaks and fixed my backflowing issue. Alos like that you can easily remove it too. nice!"
1,Beware of the Specs,"The specs as shown in the ""Brass C260 Seamless Round Tubing"" provided by ""Small Parts"" are inconsistent. For tubing, the ""OD"" should be equal to the ""ID"" plus twice the ""Wall Thickness"". 56 of the 123 entries for round brass tubing are incorrect. You may not get what you expect if you're counting on telescoping different tubing sizes. An example is: 'Brass C260 Seamless Round Tubing, 3/16"" OD, 7/64"" ID, 1/64"" Wall'. One of these three numbers must be wrong."
5,Perfect Fit,The bass tubing was a perfect fit for my project. The packaging was great No damage to the tubing and the service was fast.
5,brass tubing,it was just as described. It arrived on schedule and I was able to start my project right away. I am very happy with this transaction.
2,brass tubing,"I was quite surprised to find this on the Amazon website. And, the price was right and it was exactly the size I needed for my project, and came promptly."
5,Lincoln's Last Stand,"I am getting tired of reading fiction, and I saw this in Borders one day and didn't hesitate to buy it. Thank God I did. This is a really good book. It lets the reader know all the characters involved and what exactly happened on that fatal day in April of 1865. Also, there are lots of facts that I learned...for instance, that Lincoln lived for another nine hours after having been shot.If you like the era of the Civil War or are curious about Lincoln, buy this book. It will probably make you want to buy a biography of Lincoln afterwards."
4,The day Lincoln was shot,"The book was purchased for my 16 year old son for a US History project. He has gotten the needed information from the book. Project underway, let's hope for an ""A""!"
4,Compelling and unforgettable!,"This is a tremendously suspenseful and thorough depiction of the last day of Lincoln's life. Bishop chose to include only the minimum of details that led to Lincoln's assassination (reading David Herbert Donald's ""Lincoln"" beforehand proved helpful to me), and barely any details of what the conspirators faced afterwards (I followed this book with Gene Smith's ""American Gothic"" to complete my understanding of what happened to them). The payoff is a book that allows the reader to see the movements of the principals in a suspenseful, clock-is-ticking fashion. You couldn't have paid me to put this book aside!"
4,The 24 hour span of time before the death of Lincoln.,"A wonderful read about Lincoln's life in the last 24 hours and the conspiracy that resulted in his assassination. This is a wonderful book, and one only grows to admire Lincoln after reading it. One also sees how Booth and his assorted idiots planned the killings. A determined effort by the government in protection for key members could have prevented this. The President's bodyguard went off to a bar, along with the other staff. Bishop researched this book for twenty to thirty years before writing it. The only criticism is that the beginning drags a little, but otherwise a great read."
4,Very thorough implementers and users guide,"The Book of SCSI provides a very thorough introduction to the implementation and operation of the SCSI bus. It covers all of the SCSI operations, including signal timing on the bus, and clearly differentiates between SCSI features that normally confuse users. If I was doing anything with the SCSI bus, this book would be on my desk.The only drawback from my perspective is the heavily PC-oriented focus in the implementation section (more Unix information would be nice). An update providing more current information on SCSI-3 would be helpful."
2,Outdated.,"This book is easy to read, but the information provided is very old (in computer years.) Most of the most common forms of SCSI today, such as LVD, are not even mentioned. This book needs a major update."
1,Double DVD pack,"I ordered this and all I received was Gremlins 2 - The New Batch. I contacted Amazon and they did refund my $$, but the seller never offered to make this right at all. I ended up ordering this from another vender. I was very disappointed in this order. Also, the seller claimed this was ""new"" and it wasn't. It didn't even have the plastic wrap around it!"
4,a great movie to watch over and over and over and ....,I had to have this in my collection. the movies did came in their own dvd case in great shape. made my order on Saturday and got the product on Tuesday. sweet.
5,*Great Movies!*,These movies are wonderful.I remember watching them when I was younger and they are such fun to still watch.My son also enjoys watching these.I recommend these to everyone to enjoy.
5,gizmo ka-ka,I've seen this moive on tv befor the part 2 is better then part 1 this moive was hard to find. they dont make this moive anymore. auyway I fond at best buy the frist time I wanted this moive. I told my mom\ can i go see if they have this moive and she said yes. so i want and asked the guy do you have gremins he looked it up and he took to the scay moives. and ther it was when i look to the side thers my mom. so i asked her can i get this moive she said no so i did not get it. that time but the next time i did but this time i got it with my grama. and we took it home and wath it my grama did not like the part when the sun. gets on them and die and green stuff come out of them. and so that how i got it.
5,Fun memories,"Definitely cute movies, fun to watch now and remember loving them when I was little. This is a great deal here, though beware, the cases are the paperback kind, if you care at all."
5,Its Gremlins whats not to like.,Very pleased with this product saw this movie in theaters when i was little and its still as good as i remember glad to see it as a package deal everywhere else the first one was the same the same price as this package so this is a very good deal thanks Amazon
5,Gremlins (special Edition) Gremlins2-The new batch,"I got this to give as a gift, don't know the quality of the product. It all looked good. Didn't view them. Did receive in a timely manor. Thank you for that."
3,Winter of the Dead- overly grim and dark?,"Although this book was very informative and taught me a good deal about the first few years in James Towne and the hardships the colonists suffered, I found that it was overly dark and scary. I appreciated the historical accuracy, such as when John Smith was injured, but, especially nearing the end, I found it very horrific. I know that this is what it was really like, but to have John Ratcliffe tortured to death, Nicholas Skot cannibalize a fourteen-year-old boy's corpse, and Peter Scott tortured into confessing that he murdered his wife and then burned at the stake all in quick succession, while myriads of people are dying all around them all the time was simply to much. I am thirteen years old and didn't sleep well at all after I read this book. I would recommend it for those who have a strong stomach."
1,Very disappointed with content.,I am so very disappoiinted with this book. Considering this book is set in 1609 and about the founding of Jamestown I would not have expected there to be swear words in it. I purchased all the books in this set that Elizabeth Massie wrote but I am very apprenhensive to have my children read the other books.
1,Are you kiding me?!?,I am a big fan of Wim Wenders and his films for a long time- especially this movie- which is why I am so surprised that he coudn't find it in himself to add english subtitles to the EXTENSIVE foreign language scenes. Does he have such a distaste for this country that he would shoot himself in the foot over something which amounts to NO effort on his part. A LOT of people here love this film and would gladly shell out big bucks for this cut- BUT NOT UNLESS WE KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS BEING SAID! Just an idiot move on his part.
1,Hard to Get Until the End of the Movie,"This futuristic, post-apocalyptic thriller/ comedy/ romance tries to deliver some clever ideas about the power of dreams, memory and its manipulation and control. One should always praise a film that dares to raise thought-provoking questions, yet in this case I can`t help but give it one star. Despite the gripping premise, this movie is too long, unfocused, slow and disjointed to deserve a higher rating. Director Wim Wenders has an interesting concept, still he seems uncomfortable with the material here and the result is a failed attempt. The plot is contrived at best, the characters` motivations and attitudes don`t make much sense and the story truly is a test to one`s patiente and good-will. Ok, so the soundtrack is alright and the directing is competent, but that`s it. Maybe a remake could give a better life to this concept, since this effort is pretentious, incredibly boring and seems unfinishable. It just drags endlessly.One to skip."
2,Bah!,"Bought this movie based on current reviews. Watch it, Long, Slow, not very good much less great. I guess you have to justdisregard the reviews."
4,An Obscure Classic,"The first time a saw this film was a in a summer school class on road movies. It blew me away. This sprawling, surreal, and intelligent science fiction thriller is one of the most unique films I've ever seen. German director Wim Wenders goes globe-trotting in search of a device that can let blind people see, but in each country he adopts a different genre for the picture. It is inthralling if you stay the course, but you must understand that nothing will make sense for a least an hour. Supposedly there is a five hour director's cut floating around somewhere that is even cooler."
3,Mixed feelings,"I love Wim Wenders and his Wings of Desire and Million Dollar Hotel are my two most favorite movies. (You know it's a bad review when it starts with that!) I don't want to watch this one again. But it was great. It seemed like it had serious holes in the story, and when it was over I was a little unsettled and almost depressed. But it did make me think about deep stuff, like what people would do anything for and then what lets them transcend that. Now that I know there's a 20 hour version, I bet that one is amazing and worth watching, but unless you're a real fan of the people making it I wouldn't recommend this 2 or 3 hour version."
2,"Okay movie, low quality product.","I enjoyed this movie. It is a bit dated, but okay. However, I downloaded it to my PC, and I was not impressed with the quality.To be fair, it does not look like a great deal of effort was put into this release, but the download to my PC was not very good. It was not my PC. I have Windows 7 64 bit with 8 gigs of RAM, and my monitor is a 24"" 1080p LED. The video way choppy none the less."
3,Is It Over Yet?,"I too read the great reviews before watching.Story:A brunette meets Jeff Bridges and falls in love. She becomes a blonde in order to follow him around the world until he agrees to take her home to meet his parents in Australia. Daddy is an inventor and mummy is blind, but that's ok, because mummy dies and everyone goes insane .. except that is, for the stalker who follows the girl who is following JB. Her stalker boyfriend rescues her from her insanity and she becomes an astronaut.4.5 hours of nicely shot scenery and overacting break-up the story line.If you watch movies for their 'artistic' value, you might like this. If not, I suggest taking a few drugs before tackling this movie. The movie breaks-down nicely into 2 parts .. chasing people around the world and Australia. You could stop when they arrive in Australia and pick it up again .. say .. 10 years later and not miss anything.BTW, the vision of the future from 1991 POV was well done."
4,"Engaging, but best taken with a pot of coffee.","The movie is a long one, and it has the feeling of a TV miniseries due to it's manifold segways from disparate situation to situation. The director doesn't seemed concerned with the fact that the movie seems to be contantly roving. Good performances and the story was interesting.I'd like to gripe about the fact that the soundtrack, although impressive, was not remixed to keep the vocals either subdued, or more preferably removed completely. It causes some aggravating moments where you're not sure what you're supposed to be focusing on, and makes this seem even more removed from conventional cinematography.If this is rereleased onto DVD I hope they remaster the sound to accomodate this. Also, I think this movie would be best cut into two or three parts. This would make a good TV series-in fact it seems tailored for it."
4,casting@ev1.net,"Hmmmmmm I am really tired of professional critics! None of them got the sense and idea of this movie at all. What we saw in 1991 release, was almost as far as I am concrened exactly what we may just get in the by 1999 and beyond. Sony just released a Vid Phone, Duhhhhhhhh I am sure it wouldn't be hard to get it hooked up by wireless internet, Duhhhhhh Well as much as the producer knew in 1991 about the future, they came as close as possible as anyone else. Today we do have a majority of the technology displayed in the movie. If anyone deserves to take credit for inventing the internet, it is these guys. I think, the movie is really a rememberance of what happened to each character rather than a third person version, as noticed by the end of the movie. We remember in levels of excitement and suffering, so that is how this movie was constructed."
5,Great Book,"I just finished reading this book. I am currently learning VB and neither the teachers nor the books I previously read explained anything about how to write decent code, and in many cases gave examples of bad code. I was amazed to discover from this book that every procedure should have an error handler, but it really makes sense. This book has really opened my eyes."
5,Even if you know how to write a Complier over the weekend...,"and no one can teach you anything new, because you already know everything, I still think this book is defintely worthwhile. So if you are new to programming and/or Visual Basic this book is an absolute must-buy. Do yourself a favor and learn a clear, concise methodology from the get-go, before you fall in love with your own personal style."
2,Ok for beginners,"There is obviously a need for such a book. However, Microsoft Press suggests this book for intermediate to advanced users. I would target this at beginning to (perhaps) intermediate users. Others will be disappointed as I was.Lots to disagree with here as well. A recomendation is made to only place ByRef in parameter definitions if the user INTENDS to change the parameter while in the routine. ByRef parameters which the user does not intend to change receive no prefix. Not the best advice. Another section suggests branching to a graceful exit point if input data is invalid. Since invalid input data generally suggests a problem elsewhere in the code, a better suggestion is assertion (a subject not discussed and perhaps out of scope) and/or raising an error. Some of the treatments seem pretty shallow - for example, the section on error handling is more a tutorial on the basic error object."
3,Good tool,This tool (not a toy) does the job. The grooves are a little close together...smaller than I expected. Your gnocchi dough has to be exactly the right consistency to this tool to make the grooves just right....takes practice. It does do what it is supposed to do and is much easier than using the back of a fork to make the little grooves to hold sauce for a great gnocchi dish.
5,"Rock on, Erin!","I am a long-time Glamour reader and have been mesmerized by Erin's story since she was diagnosed. It takes a lot of courage to go public with such an intimate story, and Erin tells her tale with such grace that it was really hard for me to put the book down -- I literally finished reading it within 48 hours (which made my husband laugh because I read an entire book before he even finished a chapter of his). BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,multi faceted reading,"Erin has the rare ability to simultaneously be candid, funny, endearing and intelligent while recounting the amazing story of facing her worst nightmare. She tells her story honestly without the slightest affection or the need to evoke pity. I thoroughly enjoyed this read. I was so sad when the pages kept turning and then there were none. I await with baited breath her sophomore endaevor!"
2,Disappointed,"I guess I'm the only one who wasn't totally insired by her story. I did not follow her stories in Glamour, but I am a young woman who was diagnosed with cancer in her 20s. I was expected to find a lot of situations I could relate to. There were a few, but I kind of lost interest when I felt she kept going on and on about everything she did for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Compared to the cancer survivors I know in real life, she just seemed unreal. But then again, all the cancer survivors I know have been through chemo and/or radiation."
4,Previn,"This is different,starting in the 40s which doesn't get you back into the ricky ticky,listening to Previn's growth in maturity & his articulation makes it easy .Grade A"
1,"Something is wrong here--is it me or the so-called ""refill""?","The wide version scrape the enamel of my teeth when that space is just a little shy of ""wide."" That can't be good for my teeth. And how do you refill them? the brush doesn't screw out. No instructions come with them."
5,Very pleased!,"My dentist asked me to get some of these . Walmart no longer carries them . Those from Amazon came quickly , and are a great benefit to my teeth ."
4,Fun for home use,"I really enjoy playing with this at home. However, I bought it with the intention of wearing it under my clothes in various public places. It's a little too bulky to be inconspicuous, and a little uncomfortable to sit on for very long.Still, lots of fun at home!"
2,A little bulky,I bought this because it was mentioned that you could wear this discretly under your clothing. The part that staya outside of you is a bit bulky and akward feeling. A good toy if you would just use it in bed but not so much out.
1,Wireless butterfly,"Absolutely horrible!!! Very loud. Upon tightening straps, one of the wings pulled off. Very cheap made. The wireless remote does work about 75 feet away. But is still a bad product."
1,Very Poor Quality.,Purchased for my wife. Tried to carefully remove the module to install the batteries and the outter portion began to break. The product is not physically designed to work like it is suppose to. This was as waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.thank you
3,Fun!,"This was so much fun! It needed some maneuvering to get it positioned just right, and didn't have a strong enough vibration for me to experience an orgasm, but it was so much fun to share this secret with my boyfriend! We both enjoyed it tremendously."
5,18 Articles that represent the state of the art.,"This is the sixth annual version of this book which publishes these peer reviewed articles that represent the state of the art as it exists today. This is a science that is changing so fast that in order to keep up it is necessary to go to this approach rather than a single author writing a book as will happen when it settles down.This edition contains 18 articles written by a who's who of the field. They come from virtually every major research institution in the country and there are several entries from other countries.I particularly enjoyed the look back over sixty years of medical genetics written by Alfred Knudson. In medical school during World War II, he was in at the beginning of the modern era of genetics research and specialized in cancer research.The other articles are all of high caliber. Some of course, more interesting than others. But all are worth reading, you never know when you will pick up a useful idea."
2,Pudding Lane Shepherds Pie,"Having grown up in London and being very familiar with Shepherds Pie, I thought it would be convenient to use this mix and, as it was produced in England, anticipated that it would be a good product. I was wrong and very disappointed. Even though I added vegetables to the mix, it remained bland and flavorless. It needs a lot of work to make it tasty and, that being the case, you might as well cook it from scratch - it's not that difficult."
5,This book provides great insight into southern rural life .,This book allows the reader to see southern rural life. It helps the reader to understand the social order in the south and the social morays that governed the rural south of the 1940's. It is excellent book as it is full of amusing stories that will leave the reader laughing and at times sad.
5,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop","I needed to watch this for a compare and contrast college assignment, comparing Blood Simple, by the Coen Brothers. I liked it better than the movie Blood Simple, since it was more slap stick and straight humor, although I love them both! Watch this. It's lots of fun! Sub-title English - but simple, sparse lines. The scenery and costumes are awesome."
3,Different,"A rather different type of story with ever changing creative comedic events that left you guessing as to what would happen next. Great photography, sets and costumes but very disjointed and unpolished story line that feels incomplete and unfinished."
1,"Golly Gee! The trailer looked good, but gee whiz.......!","With my wife being asian, I thought that she would be more forgivable for me making a bad choice for an asian film to watch after work today. But, I had to apologize to my wife for asking her to watch this film with me, instead of letting her want to go outside and wash her car.This movie was so slow and just didn't seem to go anywhere. After the movie, I clicked on the bonus features section. I wanted to see if the film maker offered any kind of verbal or printed apology for making us sit through this terrible movie.Not only did I have to waste nearly two hours of my precious time watching this lame movie, now I owe it to my wife that I'll have to wash her car for her, which will be my way of apologizing to her for wasting her time watching this lousy film with me.Boy, what a big disappointment!"
1,It is for Subaru Forester if you are willing to do some modifications,"Cheap mud flap, made of low-grade plastic. It may fit on Subaru Forester if you are willing to put in some works to modify it. The brochure comes with the shipping box indicates that this mud flap was made for hundred of cars.It does not deserve even one star. I returned it immediately once I know what I got."
1,Sad.....but true!,"Roy Orbison is my favourate singer after Elvis Presley. Ihave most of all his LP's and CD's. His voice is uniqueand has given me 45 years of real pleasure listening to hisrockers, ballads and country songs as well (buy Roy Orbisonsings Don Gibson). However it is sad to say but this ratherunknown LP or CD from 1975 is horrifying. The recordingquality is terribly poor and something was wrong by thenwith his wonderful voice. He can't reach the high notes,and the low ones are trembling. I can't understand how therecording company could ever release it. Did they try toruin his uncomparable career? It's simply trash. This can'tbe the same guy who was still to be so tremendous popularin the second part of the 80's with You Got It or CaliforniaBlue just to mention a few. Please don't make the same mistakeI did by purchasing it. No wonder I had never heard of itbefore. If we want to preserve our wonderful Roy, the saleof this record should have been prohibited then and nowadaysas well."
4,Improves every year,"I've been a user of .mac since the free days, and happy to discover that the annual renewals are cheaper when bought from Amazon. Paying for all of this is the one mark against it, but I can't fault Apple for covering their costs. They offer good extras for the money. E-mail has been very reliable for me, and the integration with my data for syncing and backing up is a bonus."
4,The new .Mac,"Apple has enhanced .Mac recently with an improved backup program and additional storage space online (1 GB now, which can be divided between your email and iDisk accounts however you like). They have also increased the server bandwidth you can have each month for hosted data on their .Mac homepage servers (all the better to Pod Cast with). But the main feature for most users remains the automatic daily offsite backup over the internet of your most critical files. .Mac becomes a great alternative to sneakerware with a full gig of storage (especially if you have broadband at home and at work)."
4,.Mac Renewal,"Best price I could find when I needed to do the annual renewal of my .Mac account. I had seen lower net prices earlier with rebates, etc., but I didn't need it then."
5,Really is worth the subscription cost,"I belonged to .Mac since it first became available. I used it mostly for e-mail and some backup of vital files. I was considering dropping it but Apple has improved the service and features. It is especially valuable with multiple Macs. I have Macs at home and at the office. The ability to synchronize my calendar, bookmarks, e-mail, and contacts has been a great asset. It also syncs with my Palm Tungsten E. I have also used it to post vacation photos, host my home page, manage mail on the road, and post files for downloading. Apple used to keep me going each year with free software. They seemed to have slowed down on this, but the software goodies are a nice bonus that can help the service pay for itself. It has an intuitive interface and I have never had problems with service not being available. Highly recommended."
5,best stuff EVER!,"my dog has studdenly gotten scared of storms and i didnt want to give her a pill from the vet that knocks her out completely. So i decided to get this a try and it works! within half an hour she is calm and mellow. it really seems to take the edge off! And I love that it is a liquid, when she gets stressed out she won't take a pill. I an going to be buying in bulk next time!"
5,One of Wales' finest exports,"This CD does only include two tracks. However, its worth buying for the absolutely awesome version of ""Spunk Rock"". It runs for 22 minutes despite fading in approxomately 10 minutes after it started (according to Deke Leonard).Spunk Rock is highly structured and brilliantly executed. The mix is terrific. Its great to hear a band in ""The Zone"" and the bass, drums and twin lead guitar play off each other very well indeed. I first heard this in 1973 when I was in my teens and it has not lost any of its sparkle.Man are still a fine example of music being its own reward. Buy it!"
4,"Intresting group of snort stories, poems ec.","I finally finished Raincoast Chronicles First Five. I enjoyed the old time articles but found the book to be so large and heavy that it was hard to hold. Only because it was interesting would I ever finish it, I enjoyed it."
2,Only use this as a companion learning tool- not for self study.,Let me first state that taking Chinese is far more difficult to study than most other languages. Being in a classroom setting with audio input or some audio software is very important-none provided here. A book alone just cant do a beginner justice. I would leave this one on the shelf.
5,good enough for me,The seller was the only person on the Amazon.com market place willing to ship to Canada. the creative website had this part as out of stock and since they aren't selling the vision w anymore my options were limited. Too bad more of the sellers on the market place aren't willing to sell and ship to canada.
2,Not really what I thought I could use it for.,"I sort of thought I could ADD to the 32G of my Zen Vision W but it works the other way around and I could've done the same with a USB cable or flashdrive and PC. I'd actually return it but there is nothing wrong with it, its just my not wholly understand its use."
2,Works ok but way overpriced,"It does what it is supposed to do. But it's completely overpriced for what it is. It should be about $10. Still if you want to use SD cards with your Creative Zen W, this is necessary. 4 Stars for functionality but -2 stars for price."
4,Brimming with enlightening and interesting information,"This book is brimming with enlightening and interesting information, but the thesis could perhaps be more strongly made. I reviewed this book, as well as Millennialism and Violence, and Millennium, Messiahs, and Mayhem: Contemporary Apocalyptic Movements, in The Journal of Conflict Studies, Fall 1998."
5,Very relevant to contemporary struggles over gun rights.,Dave Palmer makes clear that the Second Amendment was aboutmilitary organization. It was not concerned with the civil rights ofprivate individuals ...
1,Not a Good Purchase for a Novice,"I bought this as a gift for a friend. We spent two weeks trying to figure out why we couldn't see anything in the lens. We gave up today and returned it.The directions are good for putting it together, but there is NOTHING in the directions on how to use or troubleshoot. The Bushnell website and calls to their helpline were also of NO USE.I would NOT recommend this telescope to a novice or anyone for that matter. It was more frustration than anything!"
4,Useful,"Used this book in my auto class, it was great. Easy to follow and find answers to your questions. I recommend this book for Suspension class or performing a job. Im glad I bought this instead of renting cause its mine to keep."
1,Utterly Awful Anti-Choice Propaganda.,"A simply awful work with disturbingly graphic photographs of aborted fetuses and such blatantly anti-choice propaganda it made me sick. I thought this was a book about pro-choice options and it was completely misleading. I threw this hateful stuff in the garbage lest anyone else read it! And it was not hardcover when it was sent to me from the used book source I bought it from, it was softcover. Very dissapointing!"
5,12 inch traffic lead,Traffic lead was exactly as described. Came quicker then expected. It was the perfect length for intended use. Only negative would be that it is very stiff.
4,R&B or Rock & Roll?,"This is the transition from R&B to Rock & Roll. Raw tremelo heavy guitar, raucus blaring horns, and booze soaked soul shouts make this a must have for fans of the primitive."
3,Vico's lectures on rhetoric are a key to his NEW SCIENCE,"Vico spent time to review his lectures for the students in Naples and kept their manuscripts always on his work table, consulting them, correcting them, adding new thoughts and examples from the classics. He started teaching rhetoric in 1699 and we have two surviving documents of 1711 and 1741 from which this first English translation has been derived. With regard to techniques the rhetoric here explained has one purpose: that of giving to law students the means to introduce, explain, prove, and defend a cause in court, in one word, to persuade. With regard to philosophy this book speaks of the nature of education, of language, of the first original form of language, and of the truth that essentially man is just speech."
4,Superior product,Exactly as described in the web site. Very useful product. We use it in a commercial office building. Very effectiveproduct.
4,simple clean indoor extension cleaning system,"This product works very well with high ceilings and high fans,it was hard to clean the cobwebs and dust.Now everything is looking good for the Holidays.The long duster is a little weak and flexs a little more than I would like but for the price compared the the others for a lot more money it is great.I would recomend this product to others.The company did go a little overboard on the packaging but it was undamaged!"
4,Nice cleaning package,"One word of caution, be very careful when dusting around hot items such as lamps. I dusted my lamp when it was on - big mistake. The duster fused to the bulb and now my duster has a hard melted clump in the middle. Otherwise, I have no complaints with the package.The wand is pretty sturdy especially if not extended to the fullest length. I think you will enjoy this item, but be sure to catch it on sale."
3,Great for the price...changer is for standard light bulbs and NOT flood lights!,"Great accessories for the price, however, fan duster attachment is not very well made. The filaments are supposed to be secured via twisted wire but the filaments were falling out of the head when I took it out of the box. Also, I was expecting a light bulb changer that was universal but I guess I didn't look at the photo closely enough. The light bulb changer is good for standard light bulbs only and NOT for the typical flood light bulb that is in can-light fixtures.Other than that, can't beat the price for what you get. I just need to buy a separate light bulb changer head that fits flood lights."
5,Great deal!,"We have REALLY high ceilings & this works great! And, for under $30 ...you just cant beat it!"
5,BEST BUY EVER,I love it! I love it! I love it. No sooner did I buy this and my daughters grabbed it and started cleaning. They were so excited about its ease and efficiency that they went through the entire house and volunteered to clean their grandfather's house too.
5,Highly recommended for anyone interested in better communication,"Jeff Conklin's work is inspiring, thought-provoking, and practical. The book gets you to think about how we communicate and what gets in the way, then gives you powerful and immediately useful tools to bring out the best in our interactions. Whether you're a facilitator, team leader, manager or software developer, Jeff shows how to bridge our thinking and build shared understanding, and does so with delightfully accessible and easy-to-read prose."
1,broken ext. arms on both my portamate's,I own 2 portamate 7000 and was attracted to the cool power strip incorporated into the stand. on both of them the extension arms have broke. On both sides! Also there is alot of play or flex in the flip up stops which makes them inaccurate. this product is not worth the money.
1,HTC PM7000 Portamate,"I think this device is too heavy and bulky and not very stable to transport with a tool attached. It is OK once at jobsite, but should have a sidwalk or driveway to roll it on. Very unstable on grass. On construction site it would be a 2 man task to get it into wokplace. Just not what I thought it was going to be. Porter Cable device would have been a better choice for me."
3,Too low for tall carpenters.,"This is a decent stand if your under 5'-10"" . I had to put 3 1/2"" riser blocks under my saw which took a little time. The clips that hold the saw to the stand have broken off in under a years worth of use. Handle at wheel end too close to ground when moving saw. Vise is a nice feature. This stand is also made for Craftsman- that should be a clue to what the quality is."
1,poor quality,I just received my Portamate and put it together. I would not have bought it if I had known it was made in China. It is exactly what I would expect for a Chinese product of this type. Poor quality and worse directions for assembly. Other reviews I have seen say it comes with wheels attached. Mine didn't and I'll be at Lowe's later to get the clips to hold the wheels on. The plastic door was broken along with the plastic side panel. These things would have broken eventually because they are so cheaply made.If you want a decent quality tool for your $250 buy something else.
3,OK but has design issues,"I use this work center for my miter saw. It is a pretty good stand for general construction but not for accurate finish work.I did have a problem when an insert in the end of the unit broke. I called the company and the gal told me she would send me a replacement piece and commented on how difficult it is to replace the piece. When I received the replacement piece (without instructions) and installed it I found out what she meant and also why it broke. There is a design flaw that if you pull the extension out too far it will crack the insert. The entire end of the work center needs to be disassembled to replace the piece and I had to use some specialty tools (like a 12"" needlenose pliers) and some ingenuity to replace the broken part."
4,Love it,Its easy to set up and transport. only thing is I'd like hand grips to release the lock buttons on the legs like my dewalt table saw stand. Other than that it's sturdy and works great I'd highly recommend it
1,Don't waste your money,"I don't write many reviews but, for the amount of money I wasted on this product.... I am motivated... please do not waste your money on this stand. If they try to give it away don't take it. First of all the wheels are going to fall off and second the pins that hold the legs in position will fail and fall apart. Then you will just try to give it away to the customer where you are currently working and if you're lucky he'll take it off your hands and save you a trip to the dump.Sorry if I've already written a review on this product but, I have lots of stands and other tools but this thing really was a mistake.The Bosch t4b is worth a million if this thing is worth a nickle. I know I've owned both and junked one."
1,"Poor Packaging, Plastic Parts, low quality",Packaging is terrible. For the heavy item the packaging is pretty much useless. Item came dented and box was extremely damaged. Extremely dissapointed on product and WOULD NOT recommend to ANYBODY. As a matter of fact it was easy to open the box as it was already partially open due to the poor quality of the packaging.Returned item
3,The (Porta NOT) Mate,"They should eliminate the 'Porta' from the name and just call it the 'Mate'. The instructions recommend removing the tool before knocking the stand down and moving it; i.e, the stand is portable without the tool mounted on it. What a joke. Buy the Delta portable stand if you want a great portable stand for moving your heavy tools.Pros:The removable tool holders are nice (reason I bought the stand vs. the Delta). Easy to mount multiple tools on the stand.I like the vise. It comes in handy.Cons:Not really portable with a heavy tool attached. PITA to drag the stand around the shop. Risk having a leg collapse while dragging it.The stand is not level (on level ground) and there are no levelers. The legs need to be shimmed about 1/2"" to level it.The light is small and not very bright. It sticks out and gets in the way."
4,"Nice Product,but,be careful of the shipper","The item was shipped using DHL and arrived with both ends of the carton destroyed and not even attempted to be taped or repaired. The item itself was not damaged but there was a small package of screws,bolts,etc. missing and I have not received a reply from the manufacturer regarding a replacement. The bench is well worth the price and assembly was relatively easy. Just don't use DHL to ship."
2,DchAnderson,"I purchased this stand to support a 12"" Hitachi sliding compound. On the third occation that I used it, the right rear leg lock gave out. If I hadn't been thinking quickly it would've cause serious damage to a $700 tool. Now since the lock doesn't function at all this thing is worthless to me, even if I repair it I'll never trust it. And, forget about trying to move your saw aroung with that cheap little wheel, the extending roller assembly or leg brackets will dig in, it really is a useless feature.I'm a union carpenter with 30 years of experience and a fondness for quality tools. Anyone reading this should consider any stand on the market other than this one, you'll be happier and perhaps save yourself some money.OK, after I bashed this product in my review, I contacted the folks at HTC and they were more than happy to send me the parts to fix it, free of charge. So, there is something to be said about their customer service department."
4,Four Star Work Center,"The only negative is the sides don't come out as far as other miter stands that are on the market. Really like the power strip, vise, and light. Great item would recommend."
4,Great portable workstation,I have been using this work center for over a year and could not be happier. The stand is sturdy but easy to fold up an move if necessary. I bought several sets of base mounts and have used them to create a variety of bolt in place work surfaces. This kind of versatility is crucial in a small shop. I would buy this again.
3,product fine sercice lousy,"received with slight damage but short 1 part , retainer nut for light hood notified mfg , still no part machine seems to be fine sure stupid to make me angry over a50 cent part"
4,Great 80s Classic,"If your a fan of 80s movies this is a great one to watch! Has a good mix of comedy, action and touch of love for the ladies."
5,Kuffs is a cool and Unedited Universal Studios DVD to own!,"I am a big fan of Christian Slater's movies. This Kuffs DVD is Unedited. In the movie (32 minutes and 55 seconds), there is a scene where Kuff's partner is cursing. All the cursing in the scene (except the last two words) are edited with annoying loud beeps. After careful research, I found out that the beeps are supposed to be funny. However, the real purpose of the beeps was to avoid a R rating. I hopes this review helps other people who might think that this DVD is Edited. Kuffs is a cool and Unedited Universal Studios DVD to own!"
4,Kuffs,This is a great movie that I hadn't seen in about 10 years until I caught the end on tv. After that I quickly hopped on amazon and ordered my own copy.
5,Great Movie,This is a must see for anyone that is a Christian Slater or Milla Jovovich fan. Don't miss this wondeful move!
3,Hilarious and fun,"Kuffs was a great movie in my opinion, not only because of Christian Slater (a definate plus)but the way it mixed hardcore action with enough humor to stay away from being grouped with Arnold S. movies. I give the plot line a 2, the action a 4, and the main character who shows that we're all only human a 5, so three stars is my rating. Rent it and enjoy!"
5,Highly recommended,"Imagine playing ""name that tune"" at 5 times the speed of your ears' ability to recognize familiar sounds. This composition, made up entirely of pop music samples, deserves five stars because of its meticulous organization of disparate and familiar sounds into an exciting new composition, one that stands on its own whether or not the listener is familiar with each artist being ""plundered."" The piece never descends into disorganized noise, each sound is clearly placed where the composer intended. This is the mailbomb you want to send to pop culture.I had long been under the impression that this album was illegal in the States because of its use of unauthorized samples. I'm thrilled that it's available to a domestic audience.My only caveat: The running time of this disc is 22 minutes. But Mr. Oswald's ingenious use of these thousands of samples more than compensates for the album's brevity."
5,Handy product for keeping your iPad clean,I have used the iPad since the initial launch and absolutely love it. My main gripe has been the need to constantly clean the screen. I initially bought one of the mini stylus to try out and have since ordered a couple more for co workers. The quality is very good and the plug that fits the headphone port is perfect.My only disclaimer is that I use it as a pointer. I'm not trying to do handwriting or drawing on the iPad. It may be fine for those applications but that's not my thing. Like the iPad it is a simple design that just works.
5,BoxWave mini Capacitive Stylus (Metallic Silver),Very lightweight and compact. Seems to be made well. Works great on my Thunderbolt. Boxwave is my favorite stylus brand.
3,Limited value,"Works fine on my Android phone and iPad, but is expensive. Elastic cord would make it far more useful."
5,Excellent!,"I am really satisfied with this book. It makes great reading for beginners in Win32 API, with good examples and variety of topics. Very readable. I recommend it."
5,Excellent book for systems programmer,This book covers various general practical problems so as to enable a systems programmer to evolve and build good large systems. This book is a excellent reference. I am very happy I bought the book.
4,Good Unit,"Works as expected, was easy to install, small and light and good price. The included bulb is garbage, I had to go and purchase a full spectrum bulb to get strong white light."
5,"Great Light, easy to install","This light is perfect for under my kitchen cabinets. The instructions were easy to follow, minimal labor to install and it works great. Just remember this is a fluorescent light and not a soft, yellow light."
4,Excellent buy!,"I purchased this fixture to replace the model GU9721 fluorescent light that i got at Lowes. The one from Lowes was a cheap piece of crap.Conversely, this one is sturdy, of quality, and appears to be built to last.There's three types of fluorescent light bulbs:1. Soft white (yellowish, dull)2. Bright white (not toooo bright, provides nice light)3. Daylight (very bright, for spaces that get little\no natural light)Another nice feature is that the bulb that shipped with this fixture appears to be a Daylight bulb. It gives off a terrific amount of light. At 14 watts it lights up nearly my entire kitchen!Only negative are the instructions, which mention something about a 'diffuser' that's not found in the package or on the light. I easily worked around it. I would've rated it five stars if not for this little problem.I recommend this light fixture."
4,Nice for the newbie,"Its a good book for a linux beginner, like i am. The book covers many of tha basics but more advanced linux users will find the book useless. I was able to have a fairly good knowledge of caldera open linux within a week or so. To sum up, this book is a newbies dream but the advanced user won't need this"
5,Sophisticated,I really like it. It is sleek and beautiful and really well made.I guess I will wear this watch everyday.
4,Great Lamp But Can't Replace Bulb!,"Best desk lamp I've ever owned - that's saying a lot for an accountant who sits at her desk all day. Lamp is really bright & well-balanced. It has a 2-setting switch, which allows the user to dim the light a bit - unlike the less expensive versions of this lamp. Also, although it is a bit hot due to its halogen bulb, it isn't hot enough to double as a space heater, as a few previous halogen desk lamps I've used. The only thing that makes this lamp less than perfect is that I've owned this lamp for over 2 years (consistent use of at least a few hours each day a a few more most nights) and the bulb finally died. Unfortunately, the screws that holds the glass cover over the bulb were already stripped. I'm not sure how this is possible, as I've never previously replaced the bulb. Anyhow, it'll have to go in the trash now, making it a $75 lamp, which only lasted 2 years.I might get another one though, since I spend so much time at my desk."
4,Halogen desk lamp,"I was trying to match a halogen desk lamp I already owned and thought this one was it. It looks just like it, but it's noticeably smaller, so I can't use both on sofa end tables. The lamp works fine and I'm enjoying it and my other lamp in different rooms."
1,Do Not Buy,"Ordered this lamp and expected it to worth the 4 star rating it had.When it arrived the lamp wouldn't even light up on either the low or high setting.Overall the lamp looked dirty, and the counterweights looked like they had been reattached using a hasty superglue job; leaving residue all over the metal.Returned this lamp. What a waste of time."
1,Lamp,"I opened my lamp, and it was already broken. that's why it gets a 1 starthe lamp itself, i love it and im glad i got it, but getting it broken in the mail is ridiculousincluding the fact that i would have to pay for shipping and packaging to get a new one, its just too much"
2,POOR DESIGN,"THE SCREEN MATERIAL WAS WHAT I EXPECTED FOR A SOUND SCREEN, BUT THE WAY THE SCREEN SNAPS INTO THE FRAME IS POORLY DESIGNED. EXPECTED MORE CONSIDERING THIS SCREEN IS ACTUALLY FROM DRAPER. ALSO THE FELT ON THE ALUMINUM IS THIN AND CAN SCUFF EASILY. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
5,Must Read for Anyone who Cares about Diversity in Organizations,"Ending the Gauntlet focuses on removing barriers to women's success in the legal field, but its message is applicable across a broad range of professions and industries, and to a broad range of people who are not white males. The truth is that the playing field has yet to be leveled, and this book shows how that can be done."
5,An amazing book about the profession!,"I purchased Ending the Gauntlet after hearing many rave reviews but admit that before reading it, I had my reservations that the tone of the book would be either too shrill or academic. That was absolutely not the case. Ms. Rikleen discusses the challenges that women lawyers face and the challenges that the profession as a whole faces in a thoughtful, honest and fair voice that is truly compelling to the reader. I've recommended this book to every lawyer I know (male and female)."
1,garbage,"The cd is labeled various artists,but the cd never mentions who the various artists are.It sounds like a bunch of no talent kids in a garage somewhere trying to learn how to play their instruments.THIS CD IS TRASH! do not waste your money"
3,not too excited about the product,"I was expecting more of this product, but it was not all that. It does not help my kid float, it is practically useless for kids who cannot swim (and swim GOOD) yet."
1,Sent me a product that looks good but does not work,"I recieved the product in a timely manner but when it came to testing it, it did not work. I immediately sent t back to amazon and i am expecting my refund."
3,Too much Al Stewart,"My wife and I were listening to our Al Stewart- Greatest hits and commenting on how we've never bought another of his albums although we listened to it often. Now I know why. You have to grow up listening to someone to have to own every bit of their output. Although not bad (and sometimes good), I don't think this will be on our expansive everyday playlist. For collectors and fanatics only."
1,Clichéd,"This is the first time I have ever written a review of a record on here and unfortunatly I've been moved to do so through abject boredom.This is the most clichéd, repetitive, cringingly bad record I have heard in a long time. I'm just glad that not everyone that listens to it will understand Spanish enough to shudder at each cheesy lyrics and forced stereotypes it contains. Really give it a wide berth."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this battery to have a second one besides the one that came with my HP Jornada 568, and unfortunately it didn't work at all. After I plugged it, and charged it (it miraculously charged in 10 seconds?), it quickly discharged after 2 seconds of use. I then took it with my PDA to an authorized HP tech service in my location and they told me that the battery was useless."
3,"Fun, a little easy for 9-12 YOs","I found this on sale some time ago and bought it for my then 12YO. She was bored with it. Most of the ""eye teasers"" were wayyy too easy for her and then there were a few geography teasers that I didn't know. However, I took it out and played it with my now 4 1/2 YO and he thought it was great. There are super close-ups of animals, silouettes, and pictures divided into 4 scrambled parts. The mental puzzles are wonderful fun for younger kids, but older ones get them too fast to enjoy them. Then we just skipped the hard ones.Not the best book, but fun."
3,Phantom of the Paradise,cool movie. the movie showed up on time and was in great shape. the sound is great and the dvd had no scratches
4,French BD,"An awesome movie and a rare disc. French sub-titles are on the main feature, extras are sometimes French only. Very enjoy able and worth the money but it would be nice if they did a North American release."
4,De Palma's rock opera is a fun ride,"This vastly entertaining movie manages be both funny and tragic (often within the same scene), with neither facet undercutting the other. For someone previously familiar only with De Palma's more popular works (which I also like quite a bit) this lesser-known movie was a terrific discovery. I especially liked its unpredicability, appreciating how the story went off in several interesting directions. The DVD offers an excellent print of the film, and good sound. Extras are modest but fun: I especially liked the nice selection of genre trailers available for our viewing pleasure."
2,Phantom of the Paradise,Lost a bit over the years!Hasn't stood up as well as Saturday Night Fever or Grease...but still fun.
3,POE-SESSED! an then sum!,"A RIOTOUS 'smash and grab' Glam Rock, quasi-trans-gender, nostalgic XPOSAY expertly crafted by Brian De Palma.GERRIT GRAHAM sparkles wit and charm as our hero Beef, not forgetting Paul Williams [also responsible for the music] as the sinister 'undeadish' impresario and William Finley as our fateful Phantom [gorgeous performance].Love-interest? Songbird Jessica Harper as Phoenix. This is such a fun ride and deserves to be visited again and again.Great 'in cheek' huimor present in this one - also 'split -screens' [and screams].Would love to have a version with an 'enhanced' [surround?] sound-track."
2,What's with all the high ratings?,"Sorry but this film did not click for me in any respect. I did not like the music. The satire of the sick rock music scene had no subtlety. The improbabilities seemed careless rather than inventive. The visuals were pretty good but not well edited. The story was a bit tedious.Ed Wood meets Ken Russell and they can't think of much to say to each other. Sad. Too bad. I normally appreciate experimental and strange films.But there are a lot positive reviews and a strong following. I am about 178th reviewer. So I feel the problem may be with me. I am wondering, does ""great cult movie"" mean ""drugs""? I guess this film was just not my cup of tea. Maybe if you are into rock musical performances and at the same time cynical about the business and at the same time drugged you will do better with this film than I did. Good luck."
2,climatic letdown,"I,m a fan of the movie but the dvd I just purchased has 1 big flaw. What I consider the apex of the movie, the Paradise numbers:(Somebody Super Like You, and Life At Last)audiolly speaking sucked. I can't believe the sound enginneer opted to focus on the background noise and not in the music. What an idiot. I was anticipating hearing these through my great speakers and the dvd sound sucked. What a letdown. Had I known that the main reason I bought the dvd was so flawed I would not have bought it."
4,Ahead of its time,"Today, this is a camp film more or less about pre-disco 70s rock and roll. I won't bother summarizing the plot, but there is one, and it is OK. I took a girl to see this film on a first date, and she and I both loved it (well, she said she did; I loved it at any rate.) The music itself is a combination of camp and serious love songs, and I like it sufficiently well that I bought the soundtrack and still enjoy it.Paul Williams rocks, and is great in this one, and his music compositions are, if anything, underrated.Recommended for rock and roll aficionados."
4,Campy but Fun!,"The acting wasn't all that great, and Paul Williams is really creepy but other than that it's a fun movie. A real 70's piece of work. For Phantom fans, this would be good one for the collection. Some of the songs are pretty good, and again very 70's-ish. The ending is somewhat confusing but this is the kind of movie that it just really doesn't matter, it's not like it has a plot that you'll really get into. Campy fun!"
4,Fantastic......,"This Brian De Palma 1974 film is an interesting film. The basic premise, a songwriter who is done out of his music by a corrupt record producer, has been done many times over, but never like this. Paul Williams is perfect as the ego-maniacal Swan. William Finley does well in the role of composer Winslow Leach who becomes the horribly scarred Phantom in a really bizarre twist of the Phantom legend. But the ultimate star of the show would have to be Jessica Harper, as the love interest Phoenyx. Several years before bombing in Shock Treatment as the 2nd Janet Weiss-Majors, Jessica is the glue that holds the loose plot line together.Unfortunately, DePalma and Williams never learned how to play out ""the end game"". The climax of the film is EXTREMELy chaotic and disorienting. ...[This] film proves to be a true future cult classic."
4,Inspired casting-good campy fun!,Great campy rock film. Agree with most of the other reviews posted. I think the casting of Lilliputian composer Paul Williams was a stroke of genius on the part of DePlama. Not for every body but a good film.
5,As good as I remembered...,I saw this movie as a young kid. I found it to be pretty memorable. On a whim I ordered the DVD. Now - quite often - you see these old movies and realize they weren't as good as you remember. But this was actually quite amazing. It held up very well. My kids watched it (with the 70's garb they found it pretty weird) - but they enjoyed it as well. A keeper.
3,"On okay musical, but nothing revolutionary","A very original but not quite expressive movie with a plot that evolves way too quickly, Phantom of the Paradise is an honorable attempt to make fun of Faust and Phantom of the Opera, but it isn't much more than that. The music is fabulous, but the plot is episodic, with a clear objective to please the audience at the expense of artistry. The technical style of certain scenes is stunning, but they also vary tremendously in quality throughout the movie. Overall, the film deserves to be seen and loved, but it's definitely not a masterpiece and does not deserve to be known as one of De Palma's dreatest achievements. For that, the film simply lacks substance."
5,Faust at it's strangest.,"At the core of the film are some familiar stories, but they're cleverly nestled in wild musical numbers, flashy costumes and larger than life characters.Part Faust, part Phantom of the Opera it's a fantastic cult film to add to your collection."
4,The Phantom of the 70's,"This movie is SUCH a 70's movie - but deserves its cult classic status if for no other reason than it starred Paul Williams,featured his music, and was directed by Brian DePalma. Gerritt Graham's performance as Beef is hysterical and William Finley is really cartoonish and over the top - but, then, that's what makes it all work. I used to have a huge crush on Jessica Harper - LOVE 'Old Souls', and the ""Juicy Fruits/Undead"" feature the only appearance I know of for Jeffrey Commanor - writer of ""Toymaker"" for the Association. In all, a great evening's horror hilarity and lots of memories and a perfect companion work to ""Rocky Horror Picture Show""."
2,"Amateurish, campy, early Brian De Palma","Here is De Palma at his most amateurish - zooming in to transition from one scene to another, bad lighting and cinematography (Where is Vilmos Zsigmond when you need him?), a campy script, the look and feel of a tv movie of the week, the diminutive Paul WIlliams horribly miscast as a rock tycoon, etc. If it was not for De Palma's name on this, I doubt that this would have been released on DVD. This is defintiely not to bought if youa re expecting the higher production values of later De Palma."
2,Paradise Lost,"I am innately suspicious of films that were bombs that later develope cult followings which appears to be the case with ""Phantom of the Paradise"" after perusing all the 5 star reviews(?!). I enjoyed director Brian DePalma's earlier forays into comedy with ""Greetings"" and ""Hi,Mom"" and later with ""Scarface"" but this film is virtually bereft of any humor, macabre or otherwise. This film does not work as a good rock satire like ""This Is Spinal Tap"" because it offers nothing resembling insight into that world. It does not work as a horror comedy because it's stabs at macabre humor fall flat. It does not even work as a good comic re-working of ""Phantom of the Opera"". The acting is nothing to write home about. I don't know what is worse, Paul Williams lame acting or the abysmally forgettable song score he contributed here. I guess this film can be appreciated on some camp level but you have to be in the mood."
1,"I'm Sorry, But I Didn't Like It.","This movie is a strange spinoff on The Phantom of the Opera, with a rock twist. It is totally different from the origional story, and I just didn't care for it. Actually, I thought it was a bit of a joke. There is no way I would wast money on buying this movie. I saw it once on TV, and that was enough!"
1,What is this~?,"What's up with this film? It was my waste of money, and I saw anything good in it. Why is this film has almost 5 stars? American thing it must be.....worst class, worst art, and worst story. I want my money back. I would rather spend it for MacDonald Sandwhich or something."
4,Saw Phantom at the Drive In!,"Remember those? It was in '74 and we went every night for a week until we memorized the songs. What a trip down nostolgia lane to see the video for sale. The music is still fresh (P. Williams knows how to pen a tune) and the story is timeless. Can't imagine it's been 25 years and I can still sing the lyrics. Worth the buy, worth the watch, worth the listen (get the sound track)."
5,"Loved it then, love it now!",I first saw this flick as a first run movie back around the mid seventies in Singapore. Paul William's music was excellent. The movie had my friends and I humming the tunes from it for months afterwards. Loved it and highly recommend it.
5,Phantom Of The Paradise,"Paul Williams does a great job with a remake of a classic.If you like Rock Operas, you will enjoy this."
4,LOVE IT! Got yo have it!,"I saw this movie when I was a kid as a double feature to Monty Pythons ""In Search of the Holy Grail"". It left an impression with me that I will never forget. YES, it is campy, silly, corny and all that. But it is FUN. It has some great music and unforgetable perfomances. I can watch this movie again and again. LOVE IT!!!"
4,A brilliant pshycodelic movie from a master of cinema.,"Without any doubt this is the weirdest movie by Brian de Palma, the one truly master of suspense of the last three decades.The story that mix such legend stories as THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, FAUST and THE PORTRAIT OF DORIAN GREY is incredibly fun,the amazing score by Williams, the nightmarish art direction and the frenzy edition make this movie a must.Search for the shower scene."
5,The hell of it,"A glam-rock delirium for lost souls, one-hit wonders and Quasimodos in a mood for revenge!"
5,Amazing!!,"I heard great things about this movie before I bought it, and to be honest I don't regret a bit my purchase."
3,"free as a board, in french","sorry but a little puncture in the balloon. the film is wonderful, the cameras are intoxicating in their winding and climbing swirls. And the tunes are terrific, sung soulfully and exceptionally. But the disc COULD be better. I don't think the remastering was as good as I expected on blu ray. and frankly the French track sounds better. AND I couldn't get the extras to play on my player. It was great, but I'd wait for a domestic release that takes better care. Everywhere."
5,A Forgotten Classic,"It's impossible to explain to someone who hasn't seen it exactly why this movie is so addictive. I've simply popped the tape into the VCR for numerous friends and let it speak for itself. Bolstered by superb star turns by William Finley as the gentle composer turned Phantom and Paul Williams as the seductively dangerous producer who exploits him,Phantom of the Paradise is a very compelling film. Williams' score is beautiful, listenable even when saterizing the 70's music scene.One thing remains a disappointment about the DVD release: The lack of extras. Just check e-bay where tapes of the radio spots go for big bucks. There is material available. I interviewed Paul Williams a couple of years ago, and at that time, he had recorded audio commentary for a Criterion edition. WHERE IS IT??? As he says it is the most satisfying professional experience he's ever had, I'm sure he'd have interesting things to say."
5,You'll never believe this film...,"Along with the infamous ""Rocky Horror,"" this has to be the coolest musical ever. The songs, the actors, the script, the visuals! it's all so much to take, but it's definately worth watching! Brian de Palma should have made more films like this underrated gem of a cult film!"
4,A TRAGIC ROCK OPERA REMAKE OF A CLASSIC FILM.,"I LIKED THE UP TO DATE STORY LINE. THE SOUNDTRACK BY PAUL WILLIAMS IS FANTASTIC. ""PHANTOM`S THEME"" IS MY FAVORITE SONG. THE CAST WAS A STRANGE ESAMBLE YET THEY ALL PLAYED THIER PARTS VERY WELL. PAUL WILLIAMS PLAYING THE PART OF ""SWAN"" WAS WELL CAST AS WAS BILL FINLEY AS ""WINSLOW""."
4,D.J. X-pression X-cutioner Style,"Upon my initial listen I really didn't know what to expect from this album. I had never heard of the X-ecutioners until I saw there video for the song ""It's going down"". The song was primarily rock driven and featured members of the group Linkin Park. The scratching in that song was unbelievable which prompted me to buy the album. The opening intro just blew me away. The way 4 d.j.'s could combine their separate styles on one album and have it not sound like a jumbled mess was incredible to me. This X-ecutioners album epitomizes the true creativity of hip hop in its purest form. The track production is tight and coincides perfectly with the groups cuts and mixes. There are a few guest m.c. appearances which do the album justice(except for the Biz Markie track)but the highlights of this album is when the d.j.'s let loose on a track. It is truly a beautiful thing. Give love to the d.j. or d.j.'s in this case and pick this one up. You will not regret it."
3,X-Ecutioners Got MAD Skill but.......,"The heavy metal/rock on a hip hop album is shameful. If this was in the early 90's they would be labeled CROSSOVERS. Also most of the skits are whack! But they do have NASTY turntable skill and I recommend underground mixes by their individual members such as Roc Raida, Mista Sinista and Rob Swift. Ive heard some really good ones. Still tho this CD is worth checkin out."
3,Using outside talent to sell,"Yeah I bought this CD based on the It's going Down single which is really awesome, but this CD is short of anything awesome, there are a few stand out tracks, but overall the tracks are jsut boring, I usually enjoy scratching and beats, but on many of the tracks there are no beats, jsut some guys showing off their scratch work, or the beats are too slow, maybe I was expecting too much, but when you look at other CDs like Sway and Techs this or that, you have to wonder, Sway and Techs CD is awesome and keeps the beats going but this CD falls flat and uses the guest names as a selling point."
5,Works as noted,"This does what it is supposed to do, it color codes your wires to make installation easier for the do it yourself people."
4,Seeing Emily,"""SEEING EMILY"" by Joyce Lee Wong is a delightful and refreshing read.Joyce Lee Wong's poetic writing style was like sweet music to my ears.I saw myself in her descriptions. I highly recommend this book."
5,A Cherished Gift,"My mother gave this to me on my wedding day and I can't think of a gift I cherish more. Filled with her own personal stories of our relationship, her own wedding, and her feelings of my wedding it is a gift I can't wait to give to my own daughter someday. If you're looking for a gift for you daughter, this is it. Something she'll thank you for forever."
5,An inspiration to get a better job,"This book shows by example how to discover and land a better job. Those who dream and never do should read this book for ideas and inspiration. I recommend it.Wayne D. Ford, Ph.D., author of ""The Accelerated Job Search"" docwifford@msn.com"
1,Triflin',"This book is basically about 2 stupid hoes. One is educated and the other is a ghetto hoodrat. Why oh why are these chickenheads fighting ober this no good dog? What is the moral of this story? I could understand if Malik ended up with Kim or if they BOTH kicked him to the curb. But noooo, after Kim spends all this money on this wedding, Shonda comes in and ruins it and feels she's got herself some sort of prize or something! And then they never show Malik interacting with Shonda's daugther Bree. Instead of Malik breaking up with Kim and finding his own place, he moves in with Shonda. A man making good money like he is should be able to find his own place. Is this what Ms Poole defines as healthy relationships? A man going from woman to woman? Women letting him lay up with them and they both got kids of their own? I think the people in this book are triflin' just to say they GOT A MAN!"
2,Kind of a disapointment,"I bought this book because I enjoyed Yo Yo Love but it seems this one was written just because she knew people were waiting for a second novel. I didn't like the way if you read something Kim thought about Shonda in one paragraph, Shonda repeated it nearly word for word in the next. And as short as the book was (244 pages), did the author really think it was necessary to use the opening chapter again in the last as if we'd forgotten it? For those of you who felt the female characters were ""trifling"" in their tug of war over a man, remember that although this was fiction, stories like this do happen in real life and to constantly read about strong, independent women would truly be boring. Better to read about a bad woman than to be one!"
4,Good Read - not as good as Yo Yo Love,"I couldn't put the book down. I just really wanted to know what was going to happen next. I really wanted to kill Malik, he was getting on my last nerve. I felt sorry for Kim & Shonda - I think they both should've left his sorry behind in the end. The end could've been written better - not leave the girl at the alter."
3,not as good as her 1st novel,"it was ok.. i dont remember it verbatim, but i do remember it was not as good as YO YO LOVE better luck next time"
3,It wasn't all that!,"After hearing all the hype about this book, according to readers of Ms. Poole's previous book, it wasn't all that. I have read better, much better. It read so much like a children's book."
3,Not a bad read,"I read this book in two days. It wasn't that bad. If you are in the age category of 20 to 30, I do believe you can relate more to the characters in the book, because they are young and trying to find their way. If you are over 40, this book may not be quite as appealing to you. But it was an easy read."
5,Couldn't Put It Down,I was taking a vacation and needed a book to get me through a 4+ hour plane ride. I started reading this book at the airport and did not put it down until the plane landed. I had finished the book before the plane touched down on the way hame. I LOVED IT! It's full of drama! This book is the best book I've read in a while.
4,nice coffee table book,"A very handsome cover at first glance, and quite extrodinare inside also.Some awesome work from buro destruct, francois chalet, norm, remo, etc. you know... the elite swiss guys that have a nack for detail.Overall, if your into graphics design, and currently have designers block, pick it up for a while, and get inspired again. But don't expect anything other than that. If not, it's still worth it in your graphics library for reference, and makes a nice coffee table book."
3,a buy?,"I got this book as a gift. At first, I found it very interesting however, there's always better ones.Though, this is a good book for those who don't like to read... pictures and pictures of stuff. It's somewhat inspirational."
2,Exhibition of bad taste,"Good things first - ""Swiss Graphic Design"" is well put together and well designed. However, while this book contains a high level of creative work and page after page of bright pictures, I found much of the content rather shocking and explicit. Rather than classic, beautiful design, this book focuses on very trendy material. But if that's what you want and sexually explicit work doesn't bother you, then you might enjoy all the interesting design work."
5,A musician's joy of an album,"I happened upon this band playing in a plaza in Berkeley in 1991; my friends and I were blown away- it was one of the most perfect musical moments in my listening experience, and stands out clearly in my mind.I always felt this should have been an American classic recording, with several singles top of the charts. I suppose there's plenty of music is out there like that which we never find. Anyway, I found these guys (& exceptional gal) and I'm really glad I got hold of a CD copy recently, as my last wore out!"
5,great bag,This is a great bag to store a camera. It holds an extra lense as well. Would clearly recommend people buying this bag.
3,Not for camera's with battery grip . . . .,"Got this bag as part of a promotion. This bag may be great for people with cameras without a battery grip but for those that do, don't bother. I have a Nikon D7000 with 35mm lens and Nikon D600 with 24-85 mm lens, 105mm micro lens and an SB-900 flash. Camera with the grip attached won't allow the zipper to be closed; if you remove the battery grip it will close but then you're still left with minimal space for anything else besides a couple of memory cards and maybe an extra battery.Pros: seems to be well built in the Lowepro style.Cons: minimal space"
4,"Nice bag, but just not my style","I guess I should probably give it 5 stars, because it is more of a personal preference. I recently purchased a Nikon D5100 with a couple of lens and this bag fit them nicely. I just don't really like the style. Kind of looks like a ""murse"". I opted for a sling-style bag and love it. This bag is well made and if it is your style, it will serve you well."
2,Watch-out. Plastic parts will break on you.,I bough this back 4 years ago. It worked great for a while until recently when the plastic connectors popped out and my bag fell 2 feet to the ground. It ended up busting my $800 lens and now I'm out $300 to fix it. If those parts didn't break it would be great. I haven't abused this bag at all. I was simply walking and the part popped and the bag fell. I have a more complete review that I did a few years ago on youtube. Look up the shuttersight photography review on this bag. I mention the popping part there as well.
4,Web Publishing Step by Step Learning Kit,"If you are using Microsoft's Office 2000 Premium to create your Web site's this is the kit to have, can't go wrong. Because it is concise and well presented, and comprehensive, we recommend it to all our customers for whom we develop office 2000 based Web sites. The new lower price makes it a real bargin. Microsoft has built a lot of Internet functionality in Office 2000 and this learning kit goes a long way to bring it to the surface."
4,Good starting point,I recieved my copy and in about three hours I had gotten through enough of the book and companion CD that I was able to jump right into the the web site publishing fray knowing that if I ran ito problems that this book is right where I can get it fast. It reads pretty easy and it don't tell you how to click your mouse and so on...I liked the book very much and it seems to be worth every penny that I paid for it.
2,Too much stereotype,"Enjoyed Irish Gold so there was no question about following through with the sequel. Rather disappointing. Nuala is just too perfect and wonderful. The immigration officials are too mean (I can't believe they wouldn't have better immigrants to worry about rather than perfect Nuala?) Greeley's political opinions are introduced a little too often. (Republicans continue to be rather evil, mean-spirited folk). And who says Bill Clinton is a big hero with the Irish? Hardly."
2,Disappointed,"I have always enjoyed Andrew Greeley's books, but I was disappointed in this one. I have not read the first book in the series, and I probably won't. Usually Greeley tells a story well. In this one, he contorts the storyline by spewing far too much unrealistic and personally felt verbage about politics. I feel he lets his political views poison the storyline. I also agree that the two main characters are a little too perfect. It is hard to develop empathy for them."
1,Not worth the time,"The first book in the ""Nuala Anne McGrail"",series, ""Irish Gold"", was entertaining, and engaging. With this in mind, I moved on the second book in the series ""Irish Lace"".This book is not in the same league. It is mainly a vehicle for Greeley to voice his political views....as in Democrats are all good, honest, generous folk and Republicans are the devil. ""We drew the worst possible judge, Dermot. Thomas Winthrop Manley. He is a supercilious, egotistic, fussy, mean-spirited Republican.""This quote is just one of many voicing that opinion.He loves the term ""xenophobia"" and uses to OFTEN.The story line is cumbersom, and uninteresting. The dialogue is pretty much a repeat of the first book. I kept reading, waiting for the story to get better. It didn't!I won't bother with the rest of the series."
1,Mr. Greeley's Own Hatreds Get In The Way,"While the interaction between Nula and Dermont were excellent, the simplistic political undertones got in the way. It read more like a hit piece on anyone who dare hold conservative ideas. Those sections dealing simplistically with complex political issues were full of more vitriol than Irish charm. Of course if you are somewhat left of Kennedy you will love it. So bad I threw it away before completing it. I hope Mr. Greeley sticks to the wonderful courtship/relationship and a good historical sleuthing in future Nula mystries."
4,great collection of country Christmas tunes,"This is the label's third country holiday CD, and it could be their best yet. The CD is loaded with the biggest names in country music--Randy Travis, Clint Black, & Reba McEntire, just to name a few. Some of the many highlights here include Dwight Yoakum's toe-tapper from '97, ""Santa Can't Stay,"" Gary Allan's cover of the Harry Connick, Jr. song, ""It Must Have Been Old Santa Claus,"" and for those who like a little bit of rock thrown in the mix, there's Travis Tritt's great version of ""Winter Wonderland."""
2,"Not ""All-star""","This compilation left me very dissapointed. I have now listened to it for two Christmas seasons, and will probably not bring it out for a third. Many talented singers are not aligned with songs which would best show their voices."
1,"Once upon a time, Optima was a Premium Quality Product - these are JUNK.","Ten years ago, I had a red top, that was one of the best automotive batteries I've ever owned. This experience turned that opinion on it's head.I think it's ever since Johnsons Controls purchased them, but these are now made in mexico, and are complete and utter junk. If any of them are any good, the quality control is horrible. The first one lasted about 9 months, the replacement lasted about 2 months.On top of that, amazon gave me the runaround about honoring the warrantee the first time (no problem at all the second time).I can not recommend that anyone buy this product. Buy another brand from a local battery dealer."
1,Not a good choice,"Bought one for my 04 GTO, it lasted about a year and then died, sits on the charger and won't go above 10.5 volts. I expected better."
1,no warnty,"Below is a copy of the email I got from Optima regarding a battery purchased from Amazon.So be aware the the money you are thinking you are saving maybe costing you big time. You should also know that for marine batteries Otima is strongly reccomending the use of there $200 charger to keep them charged properly.Hello John,Amazon.com is not an authorize online OPTIMA retailer, We do not know where they acquire the OPTIMA batteries nor does Amazon.com honor the OPTIMA warranty."
1,Junk,Optima battery is garbage.. mine failed in 2 years and optima wont honor warranty because I bought it from amazon.
4,awesome.,"This is an awesome battery. The only negative is the install into my 2006 Hummer H3 was a bit tricky because it sits weird in the battery box. Its not level and doesn't look right, but after pulling it out and trying to install it many different ways thats the only way it fits in the battery box. Definitely worth the money."
2,Check before installing,"I bought this thinking it would be more reliable that making one myself. Not the case unfortunately. The 12V and brake lead were swapped (potentially dangerous). The left break and tail lights were not connected, leaving ground and right brake connected correctly. The quality of the parts is fine but it was assembled by someone that doesn't care and Hopkins appear to have zero quality control. If you do buy this check and fix the connections before attaching it to the vehicle and it should be fine."
4,"Stars and southern ""gentlemen""","I enjoyed this story of the ""ugly duckling"" that actually has a brain. She is the strength behind her family in many ways she is also a scientist. I enjoy seeing a woman in the 1800's portrayed with a brain.Like most of S. Wiggs books the hero turns into a big jerk just before he turns into a good man.This is a good romance story dealing with one person who is trying to get something he wants to pay a debt he has in his heart and is using someone else to get it, though missing the biggest part of the whole picture in the end. But alas the lady does not give in and do what is ""expected' and stays true to her heart and her science :)"
3,just ok,"This book disappointed me. I'm coming to really enjoy books by Susan Wiggs, but I feel this one fell short. Both the hero and the heroine were likeable enough. The story started interestingly, but then it started to drag and drag some more. The majority of the book (and I mean about 7/8 of the story) the hero was worked to get the heroine with another man, i.e. for most of the book we hear how much she is in love with another man. They were separated. More dragging. Then all of a sudden it seemed that the author remembered that the hero and the heroine are supposed to be together at the end of a romance novel and she quickly wrapped it up in about 2 pages; it was very anti-climatic. Maybe an epilogue would have left a better taste in my mouth. I just hope that her sister gets a better ending in her own story. I avoided giving this book 2 stars out of loyalty to Wiggs, but by no means do I think it deserves 5 stars."
3,storyteller,"I like the way Susan Wiggs writes; simple, to the point with words I can understand. Set in the 1800s in Washington D.C., its the story of two sisters, the older one beautiful and the younger not so, with a deformed foot that she tries desperately to hide. Their father, their only parent, wants only the best for them but the youngest, Abby, feels that in order to gain her father's approval she must marry a man of wealth and prestige. She sets out to fix her sister up with the man she loves, Mr. Butler, a military man, a Leiutenant. In the meantime Jamie a representative from Virginia has moved in next door and through his own hand changes the outcome of matters. When Abby is engaged to be married to Lt. Butler, she finds that what she thought she wanted isn't any more. A few twists and turns place the right couples together with a happy ending. I did enjoy the Astrology part which Abby was very interested in. All in all a very good story."
2,Not a 5 Star read at all,"This was an somewhat enjoyable read, but not 5 stars. The characters were stock characters, the history minimal, and the plot predictable. The world of late 19th c. Washington and the Chesapeake were not illuminated. And a minor point, chesnut horses never have black manes.The main character's issues (her scholarship and her foot) were so quickly solved by some new dresses. And, of course, the sister's love affair and marriage are just fodder for the next novel, when her husband dies or is murdered and her professor comes back on the scene.... See what I mean... so predictable!"
5,A Pygmalion story with an intelligent herione with a twist,"Tender, funny, poignant. This book has it all. I am a sucker for a well developed story that doesn't insult my intelligence where honest yet sometimes confusing feelings are concerned. Abigale is not a ""perfect"" physical specimen which is a departure from the norm, but makes up for it with her wit and inteligence. Jamie's Pygmalion style role to bring Abigale to her full potential is romantic in it's poignancy and full of humor. This book was brought to my attention by a customer of mine. She has never led me wrong and this time is no exception. I am currently looking for Susan Wiggs sequal story of Abigal's sister Helena and other offerings by this new found (for me) author. Thank you, Susan Wiggs"
1,Riddled with errors,Definitely the worst I've seen in the Exam Cram series. It looks like it was rushed to meet a dateline and I cannot believe that there was any technical review. Don't take my word for it just go through 10-20 questions of any of the exams at your local bookstore and you probably agree with my assessment. Ironically though that process might help you learn. Personally I would NOT recommend this book as I don't want to encourage such sloppiness.
1,Pure ...!,"This was my first book in the Exam Cram series, and I'm truly stunned over the absolute rubbish this book contains.Luckily someone else has reviewed and posted most of the stuff that is highly questionable in this title, so I can soon throw it away and get on with my life...It's packed with syntactical errors, wrong answers, typos, ambigous and subjective scenarios that doesn't rely on facts and blatant statements that are just not true...'There is no such thing as a unique clustered index'..???I almost fell out of my chair reading that explanation in one of the answers...The authors also apparently have no knowledge of SQL Server's security model, as they fail to recognize that one of their 'correct' answers regarding the usage of a view, would not work because of a broken ownership chain..and on and on and on...I can't reccomend this title to *anyone* - it's so bad that if I could I'd be tempted to sue for mental damage..."
2,Tall Man - an Honest Review,"I bought this movie on plain DVD because I thought the cover looked interesting, the sleeve details also looked interesting and of course Jessica Biel. I am dissapointed. At first it started out alright. But, being a fan of splatter and higher tension horror, I was disapointed. The movie never truly revealed enough for my taste. By the time the ending credits where rolling, the film made very little impact to me, just another ho hum effort to create a watered down ( not even horror ) thriller."
2,spoiler rant,I do not leave reviews but after watching this I have to say's what kind of society to we live in where its ok to take people kids because they are not living as high and mighty as others. Why not just help the parents. Do you know how many small town kids who lived in trailer or worst make it out of that. Or a ghetto. Or even the rich kids who commit suicide or kill others. This film is a slap in the face to every hard working. Mother every hard working family who hasce some troubles but still love there kids and try to give them everything. Let social services do that job by this movie saying someone should kidnap someones child because rich society does not feel like they are raised right is wrong. By the way I'm middle class. And was raised. In new York. Without a silver spoon and my kids have more and will gain more knownledge by everything around them. As I continue to grow myself. This is sickening. Not a bad movie but in bad taste.
1,It's not what you think....,"This movie is reminiscent of The Village (only with a much lower budget). Acting? meh. Plot? nada. The shocking twist was shockingly boring, and the message conveyed to the viewer is a mish-mash of elitist nonsense that'll leave you wishing you had the last two hours of your life back."
2,A Peek into The Minds of Hollywood Elitists,Its sort of a interesting story but it is definitely proof that Hollywood elitists live on a different planet. In the Great Depression days this sort of thing really went on and it was not justified by any means. Although it wasn't exactly what this movie depicts... its was done for profit in the great depression days. I would like to elaborate but I'm afraid I'll give up the big surprise ending. This movie seems to be trying to give some sort of justification or virtue to the act. But as I said I think it gives more insight into the perverse minds of Hollywood elitists.
5,"One of the great ""Sleepers"" of 2012!",Jessica Biel gives one of her best performances to date...Not a Horror film but a tense thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat...The final premise leaves you wondering if it is really happening throughout the world!
4,Twisted Movie!,I actually liked this movie. It left me in suspense which I love but even better was the ending...very messed up but it will make you think is this right or wrong...you have to watch it to understand. Overall it was a good suspenseful movie.
3,Its one of those..,"Its one of those movies where you expected it to be so good because Jessica and the storyline, but ended up a tad disappointed when I watched it. For those interested that have a Netflix account, it became available on Netflix a couple of days after I watched this movie and was disappointed I had to pay full pop."
3,so here's the thing...,"Jessica Biel did a great job! SHE CAN ACT..she's talented. The movie started out good, it had that good creepy vibe...but as it went on it was confusing and boring. I wouldnt watch it again."
3,Twists and turns,"First you think a boogeyman is terrorizing a small remote town. Then you think the townspeople are turning against a do-gooder. Then you find out she was not so good after all, but you may sympathize with her despair.I will not reveal any more but this is worth checking out for the mystery. I would not call it horror so much as a tragic thriller/mystery."
4,The Tall Man,"I have to admit that I spent a lot of time being completely confused by the plot of this movie. It did all come together by the end though and when it did, I liked it. Some people are disappointed by this kind of movie. It looks like a horror movie and then turns out not to be. I liked it though. It's definately worth watching."
3,Save the Children,Jessica B was pretty good in the movie. The pacing of the movie was strong and engaging. The actress who played the mute girl was good also.
4,Intriguing,"Arrived promptly, in good shape and was an intriguing movie. A good recommendation for anyone who wants to watch a movie that makes one think."
2,Bad Bad Bad ... way past the bone bad ...,"While the ending was not 100% surprising ... the journey through the rest of muck and depression brought 0% closure ... too dark, too depressing - There is so much help needed ""every where"" in the USA - one hardly knows where to begin. Corporate America needs to think before greed sucks life, jobs, prosperity, education and medical treatment/education out of entire regions in this country and when these things are removed - you basically have increased dysfunctional families and children with scars exponentially!! Capitalism at its best - doing the work of the devil."
2,Don't waist your money,"I watched this movie the other night. And the only time I jumped is when the dog jumped out from the truck when she open the door. Wow, I will have to say this movie sucked badly. She was the tall man it wasn't a really good story line. This movie could have been 10 times better a waist of my time and money."
1,Viewer BEWARE! This is not a Horror Movie or even a good movie for that matter,"My co-workers and I decided to watch this during a slow day at work. Judging by the cover, one is led to think....""Horror Movie"" At first the errie atmosphere seems promising. As it drags on you realise it's meant to be a thriller and by the end of the movie it's safe to say homicide has been commited. That's right, this film just killed over an hour of your precious life that could've been spent doing something actually enjoyable. Nope, it's gone right down the toilet so to speak. This movie has one of the most dull endings I've ever seen, it's just a really bad, BAD MOVIE! Please heed my advice and walk away, otherwise, consider yourself warned."
1,Biel proved one thing...,"Biel proved she's a horrible actress. She and this movie bombed. The movie is dull, keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the ending and then you just find out you just wasted your time. These type of movies are just bland and leaves you asking many questions as to who or why did they make this movie in the first place."
4,Very good twist at the end,"Great Movie, loved the Twist!The movie leads you in one direction while still keeping you on the edge! only untilthe very end does it come clear!! its really a sleeper! Great Movie"
4,Weird. Just . . . weird.,"This movie turned out to be the weirdest that I have seen in a while. However, the originality of the unpredictable plot twist was a pleasurable relief from the common mediocre blueprint that many movies seem to be following these days. The Tall Man addresses issues of child rearing by unappreciative or at least incapable parents and the effect it ultimately has on society as a whole. This was a strange one indeed, but I liked it."
4,A SUSPENSE...NOT A HORROR MOVIE....WORTH WATCHING,"All I can say is you have to watch it, a number of twists, not who you think or what you think or why you think.....sorry but that's all....or I'll spoil the whole movie. I think those who rated it it low were expectiong a horror movie, which I don't like because most are predictible and not scary. I didn't know who Jessica Biel was untill I saw this movie.....she did a good job."
4,Clever,"Atmospheric and clever, this movie was not what I expected. To her credit, Jessica Biel does a fine job delivering her most layered role to date. One particular scene weakened the story, delving too deeply into social commentary and discarding the momentum leading up to that point. Just the same, this is worth a rental on a cold, rainy night."
4,B movie that entertains and makes you think,"Fun twists and turns, good suspense and action and nary a horror or supernatural element at all to goo up the works - what's not to like about this more than adequate B-movie ride? Jessica Biel, all washed out and working classy, does a strong job fully clothed (sad to say) but the story supports her well. There are at least two major detours that lead you where you don't expect. B movie thrills and something that forces you to think as you watch. Don't like thinking at the movies? Go see Avengers again."
3,Good movie,I thought this was a fairly good movie...i didnt have any idea what the end was going to be. I liked it.
2,Not so tall man,"Jessica, Jessica did you lose a bet? Why were you even in this less then B movie? I gave it two stars because she was in it. The story was the most pointless I have ever seen, It did have a few turns that you will not see coming other then that for get it."
3,"Strange movie, but watchable.",The twist is very strange. The movie is really strange altogether. It is still watchable. Slow moving until the end.
2,Started interesting,"It certainly doesn't lack a twist, but to say it's a clever one would be false. It really is entirely social commentary just after the middle of the movie, but not really social commentary that has any basis in reality or even political affiliation...it's a dreamer sentiment that implies adversity is wrong and elitist paths are the only way...that's not really what I thought I was getting into when I started a movie called ""Tall Man"" involving a creepy figure and child abductions. It's not to say I was hoping it wouldn't be intelligent, I'm saying it isn't intelligent. I gave two stars for the fact that it was an unpredictable twist, though a silly one."
1,Not as good as #1,I sorta liked the Eye but when I read this book I was sorely dissapointed. Sure it was a great plot but with nothing happening it just plain bored me. The ending was OK but nothing exceptional.
4,#3 book review,"The story wasn't as good as book 1 or 2 of ""The Wheel of Time"" but the recording or narration was just as good. You don't get much resolution with this story. New problems are introduced at the end but not much is accomplished."
5,Favorite book in the WOT series,"My favorite used to be Dragon Reborn (Book 3), but after a recent re-read of the series the Great Hunt has replaced it. There are so many outstanding moments in this book: raid at Fal Dara, Rand encountering a Forsaken (and being trapped in an alternate world temporarily). There are several great emotionally-charged scenes: Thom's scenes in Cairhien, the alternate realities with the portal stones, Egwene with the Seanchan, Mat realizing his destiny...and my favorite-the redemption of Ingtar. What a tremendous book this was, how this wasn't my favorite before is beyond me!"
5,The Hunt for a Great Book is Over!,"In The Great Hunt, Robert Jordan continues the sage from where it left off in The Eye of the World. After discovering his true identity, Rand al'Thor is determined to disconnect himself from Moraine Sedai and other Aes Sedai permanently. Having retrieved the Horn of Valere, an ancient talisman, Rand is destined to joining another quest after it is stolen by Padan Fain and his Trolloc soldiers. With the help of Eye of the World alum Loial the Ogier and some new friends, Rand signs on to another journey while Perrin and Mat, some old friends, try to follow them. Meanwhile, Nynaeve and Egwene are led to the White Tower to begin their Aes Sedai training. In this book, the character groups are consistently right and an improvement to the Eye of the World groupings. A step up from its predecessor, The Great Hunt continually surprises and pleases."
5,The Second book in one of the greatest fantasy epics,"The Great Hunt is a compelling book for the Wheel of Time epic. Robert Jordan's skill at both storytelling and convincing the reader that he is part of the story is unparalleled in most books that I've read (the only execptions would be Issac Asminov and Anne McCaffree) This novel continues the epic seamlessly and continues with Jordan's hand on building each character into seprate, yet unsepreable characters that you can't help but have feelings for through out the entire epic saga."
3,A very nice follow up.,"I didn't fully appreciate this book until I had read it the second or third time. I had enjoyed the first book so much that I think my expectations were much too high for this one. Rather than sweeping along in the same high vein that ended the first book, this one moves at a very deliberate pace. There are some great stand-out moments in this book: We meet the formidable Siuan Sanche, Lan takes over the role of male mentor for Rand, the Black Ajah makes an appearance, the Seachan invade, and the Horn of Valere is found. This book is nicely plotted and moves to a great, tension filled climax. It doesn't disappoint."
5,Book has a feeling of tolkien.,"This book, far overshadows the first book in the series, by the mere fact that its beggining and end is not nearly as rushed and excited as the in the first. The whole book although, different from tolkien has that same warm feeling about it. Brilliant."
4,A thrill... but a little confusing.,"I loved this book and thought it was awsome but im a little confused. I started the series when my school libarian recommended the first book, Eye of the World, to me. I loved it, but after finishing the second book in the series called The Great Hunt, i started wondering about a few things. First off, where did the big bad guy, Ba'alzamon, come from? The way the the first book explains it he just popped out of thin air. And how did Min, the foreteller, suddenly change her behavior big time from being the freaky worker at the inn in Baerlon in the first book to being the light, sensitive character in the second? And finally, where the heck did Selene come from?! She's just like Ba'alzamon popping out of nowhere! These are the questions im asking to the auther, and i'll be waiting patiently for a reply."
5,Wonderful book,"The best part of the series is that all the characters act like real people. They don't act with unknown knowledge, they make mistakes and they stick to their archetypes that are more complex than ""good guy"" or ""bad guy""."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I truly love this book!! I am always completely absorbed in the serie when I read and re-read it, and The Great Hunt is one of my favorites!"
5,Better than the first,"TGH is a step and above the first book in the Wheel of Time series. The pacing is much better and the characters receive much more development. IMO, the Seanchan were an interesting touch, and learning more about the curious Ogier gave more depth to Loial, one of my favorite characters. The climactic battle involving the Seanchan, the Whitecloaks, the heroes summoned by the horn, as well as Rand and Ba'alzamon was amazing. in fact I could clearly visualize it in my mind. On to Dragon Reborn!"
3,Almost made me quit reading the series,"While the end of the book and the beginning are rather good, you as a reader should look forward to a long and boring mid section of this novel. It rambles on and on about detail and things that have little if no action.For a period of a few months I quit reading this book because the fourty or fifty page sections with the three women characters were so boring that I felt like I was wasting my time.So I warn you... if you are willing to fight through the boring sections with the women characters then I suggest reading this book, its ending is worth the wait."
3,A Good Read,"This book is a really well written book that I thouroughly enjoyed. At times it did get a bit dry, but when you did come to a good part it was fantastic. The characters after a while, feel like your best friends like you've known them forever. It is a great book for someone who is into a really long book, but for the people (kids) out there who want a good book that will hold your attention every minute that does have end this is not a book for you, ... may I recommend Tamora Pierce."
4,Once started I couldn't stop.,"The only reason this book isn't 5 stars is because I don't like how Jordan feels the need to describe every detail of everything! Sometimes you can go pages without a single thing happening. That being said the rest is amazing. Robert Jordan has weaved a world that is so complete and believable. The heroes are not black and white, and the villains are just as deeply thought through. This is a great story that only picks up in intensity the further you read. I can't wait to start the next book."
2,Better Than Book One,But not great. It will take Jordan another whole book before this series starts to show it's quality. Whether or not it's worth your time will be up to you.
3,Entertaining and well written,"I thought the book started rather slowly, finally started picking up a bit in the second half. I don't mind slow books if the character development is interesting, but it really wasn't. I do like Jordan's prose, he is a very talented wordsmith."
5,"Kindle version of WoT ""The Great Hunt""","I have read all the available books in the series in hardcover and paperback. The writing stands up great over time. Although I own paperback or hardcover versions of this series, I chose to buy the Kindle versions as I read the series this time to make it more portable."
4,The Plot Thickens,"In this second part of Wheel of Time, Robert Jordan does a decent job of telling a good story while building interesting plot-lines. There's a lot of Tolkien-esque themes here for those who loved ""Lord of the Rings,"" and this book is a much richer, varied, and complex book than the first one."
5,Great Deal,Was very happy with this. Came in exactly the same condition as promised. Very good price!
1,"Horrible writing style, and geared towards younger readers","I made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing the first 4 books all at one time, based on the strength of the reviews on Amazon. Mistake! I found that I really didn't like the author's writing style, and the plot is very predictable and geared towards very young readers. Not what I expected, and a very disappointing read. Did my best to stick it out, thinking that it HAD to improve, but bailed about 2/3 of the way though the second book. Torture..."
5,Read this book!,"I read Jordan's first book and I didn't really get into it until the very end. I was a little reluctant to pick up The Great Hunt, but I was pursuaded. I couldn't put it down. Jordan's writings are very complex and it took all of the first book for me to understand the world he creates. Now I have to go back and re-read the first book. I can't wait to read The Dragon Reborn. You must read this book! Jordan creates such a realistic world and assortment of charcters. I look foward to reading the rest of the series."
5,an excellent book,This book is one of the best i've ever read it has a great story great characters and many mysteries and plot twists in it. Truly and amzing book and an amazing anthology.
5,Great Sequel,"Unlike the first book which was mainly about traveling to a certain location and learning about things as we went, this one jumps into the action. Our characters are more confident, have grown and learned new skills and are overall more heroic. A great relic is found that our main character needs to defeat the dark one, but it is stolen right off the bat. A group of knights is formed to get in back in a holy quest. Our lady Aes Sedais in training move on to Tar Valon for training, but nothing happens as it is meant to. New twists and new characters pop up in the book as well as a new enemy nation that was only spoken of in rumors. The book doesn't disappoint, Jordan is a masterful writer that writes nice descriptive narratives that kept me deep in the story and visualizing our character's locations and actions."
4,The Great Hunt,"I really like the series and the book, however, they all contain typos!Sentences are split between paragraphs, characters names have letters missing/different and the italicised thoughts are so choppy!I have read the paper versions, which didn't have all this going on. It is so frustrating!Great story, but I think they need to be checked and rechecked for all this messiness."
4,Kindle edition is FULL of typos..,"The book itself is quite good, but I've noticed more typos in the Kindle edition than in any other Kindle edition I've read. Character names consistently misspelled, spurious punctuation, inconsistent section breaks with chapters (sometimes changes of scene have a blank line between paragraphs, sometimes they don't), and an awful lot of hyphens left in words (presumably from the conversion from a printed page). There seemed to be particular problems with ligatured letters. Rand's father Tam is consistently written as ""Tarn"" and Thom becomes Thorn. I thought I was having memory problems for a while.Anyway, there are a lot of reviews of the book itself - I just wanted to pass along a warning about the Kindle version. Do the Kindle editions ever get updated?"
5,Fantastic,"I loved this book, its a great story and a great collection. I look forward to reading the rest. Highly recommended"
4,Quite good. Very devoted to the cause.,"The purpose of the book, I found was very revealing in the development of the characters involved. The significance of the Horn of Valere seemed to be a mystery although the explanation of its power was a definate understatement. I feel that the author did a marvelous work in the development of this novel. I look forward to reading the next one."
5,I had to force myself to put the book down.,The great hunt is a very good fantasy novel. Robert Jordan has you on the edge of your seatmost of the time where all you want to do is read. It has everything from magic and monsters to people thatyou can care and worry about. It is a very exciting series and I look forward to reading every bookin it.
5,A new facet in a truly remarkable gem,"Jordan deviates only slightly from the true story inthis, his second effort in the Wheel of Time series.Don't take this to mean that he strays from the compelling story of Rand, Mat, and Perrin, far from it.He merely fills in a part of the story that I'm surewill come in handy somewhere down the line.This book explores even further the lives of theta'veren from Emmond's Field. You begin to trulybecome intertwined in the fabric of this magnificentworld of Trollocs and Fades. The heroes gain evenmore personality (IF that is possible). You trulyget to know all the characters in this quest for athing of legends.Highly recommended"
4,The most complete novel in the series,"I am currently going through my Wheel of Time Re-read in preparation for A Memory of Light, and The Great Hunt still remains one of my favourite books, if a little frustrating. Rand and Perrin are finally starting to mature (does Mat ever mature???), the story moves along at a much faster pace, and we start to see the magic and politics of the world become an integral part of the story as Jordan starts positioning all the pieces for some big action scenes. Also a very nice reference to the Towers of Midnight in this book, its amazing to think how far out Jordan managed to foreshadow the big events."
4,The best of the WOT series,"This book is my favorite of the WOT series. It has the most substance and carries, in my view, the best scene of the 11 books. Rand riding his horse into battle at Falm with the heroes riding at his back is probably one of the greatest scenes of all modern literature in my view and still gives me chills imagining what that must have looked like. Hearing this book on audio was a completely new experience to the book. As Robert Jordan says in his Interview on the CD. ""Listening to the words as opposed to reading them gives the story a whole different view, I can see how certain parts, scenery descriptions and dialougue play out and see if they come out as I intended"". RJ is right. Some scenes I read through were interpreted differently when I heard them on Audio. This purchase is worth it. The abbridged versions skip far too much. It is better to have this treasure word for word. A definate buy."
4,Lot of Fun,"The Great Hunt is a lot of fun, even though it doesn't match the complexity of the more recent books. The plotting may be a bit formulaic, but it's still better than anything Terry Brooks has ever written.Also Recomended: The Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling, The Left Behind Series by Tim LaHayn and Jerry B. Jenkins, The Shannara Series by Terry Brooks, The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, and the Remnants Series by K.A. Applegate."
2,Another one with same formula,"This is the second book of the Wheel of Time series. Its only a bit, I repeat, a bit better than the first book and thats because there's more action in it. On the whole, this book was useless.The Horn of Valere is stolen in the beginning by Darkfriends and so Rand & Co sets out to retrieve it. I still doesn't understand why the villian waited for 3 months for Rand to come and take the Horn back. He should've used it for himself in between. At the climax, Rand finds out where the Horn is kept, enters the building and picks it up without any difficulty?? Comeon, we're speaking about the greatest weapon of the world, which can bring back the army of dead. And I've even found other reviewers claiming the final battle sequence to be a masterpiece in literature. Unfortunatley, I didnt find it a bit interesting to hold my attention."
2,Bloated and Boring,"THE GREAT HUNT is bloated and boring. I'm not sure why this book even needed to be an entire book in itself. The plot is so slow and the developments are so minimal--so much of it is needless dialogue--that it easily could have been summarazed and folded into another novel as back story. Or at least much of it could have been. I loved EYE OF THE WORLD and read it in 3 days. This one has taken me more than three weeks to read. I hope THE DRAGON REBORN is better, much better. If not, I don't think I'll waste my time with the rest of the series. I've recently read George R. R. Martin's SONG OF ICE AND FIRE novels (the three that are available). Robert Jordan ought to take some lessons from him. Martin is a truly magnificent writer. Jordan isn't even a close runner up."
3,'Hunt' continues the story.,"'The Great Hunt' bogs down in the middle. There was a point where I thought 'Of course the hero will prevail. It's an 8-part (and counting) series'. I was right.That being said, the story's numerous plot threads come together marvelously to create a thrilling final 50 pages. Well worth reading.Ignore the criticism. This hasn't become a best-selling series for nothing."
4,"Good book, but not the best","This series is some of the best fantasy i have ever read, but it cannot come close to Tolkien's The Trilogy of the Ring. Jordan obviously uses some of Tolkien's ideas, such as the Uncrowned King. He also uses Tokien's device of large amounts of information and legends presented in the story, but Jordan does not interweave this history as well as Tolkien did into the story."
4,TWO ACCOMPLISHED VOICE PERFORMERS,"Two accomplished voice performers, Reading and Kramer, give bold, vibrant readings as they bring to colorful life the thoughts and actions of the myriad of characters author Jordan has so memorably introduced. Expressive and dynamic, their performances capture the thrill of adventure and wonder of fantastic happenings.Jordan has been quoted as saying that fantasy literature ""appeals to a simpler time of life with recognizable good and evil."" Both of those forces come to the fore in his Wheel of Time series as listeners/readers eagerly wait to discover which will have the upper hand.In The Great Hunt. the sequel to The Eye of the World, an onerous theft occurs. Gleemen have long related the tale of The Great Hunt of the Horn, and now that very Horn is discovered. It was believed to have been only a story, a legend but here it is, the very thing that will raise the dead heroes of the ages.Now, it has been stolen and the hunt is on.- Gail Cooke"
5,The Great Hunt,"I have totally enjoyed all of Mr. Jordan's books that I have read so far, and am looking forward to reading more of his offerings.."
4,The Wheel keeps turning,"We continue to follow the 5 friends from Emond's Field as they find, lose and recover The Horn of Valere, which is believed by many, to be mythical. It is to be blown by the Dragon Reborn, to summon Artur Hawkwing and his long-dead army, for the final battle. By the end of this book, there's no denying that Rand is the Dragon. To be continued in the 3rd book The Dragon Reborn (Wheel of Time, #3)."
4,This is the fantasy book that made me fall for the genre 4/5 STARS,"This is the fantasy book that made me fall in love with the genre and became my gateway to so many other greats. It took me a while to dig into the story and finally convince myself to open myself up to the world within. At first the writing felt too embellished and long form. But little by little it grew on me. By the time I finished book 2, I was head over heels, hook line and sunk.After Jordan, read George R.R. Martin, Steven Erikson, Terry Goodkind, and Robert Jordan. Then you'll still have C.S. Friedman, Daniel Abraham, and Susan Clarke. So many books and so little time."
4,the great hunt,I really enjoyed this book and Iam looking to more of the series. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and adventure. The characters are brought to life in a way that you feel their emotions and sympathize with them and enjoy their successes and cheer them on.Amazon is my favorite resource for finding good reading material as well as many other things.
4,"This is the best one, In my opinion","This, I think is the best Wheel of Time book. It has a really wonderful story, and I couldn't put it down! I would especially like to comment on the chapter, The Grave is no Bar to my Call. That was so good, I swear I could actually feel the heros of the horn coming back! I think this book is the best of the Wheel of Time series, which must be very good because ALL the books are excellent. Robert Jordan is the most original and wonderful story teller I have ever read. His plot is confusing, but it altogether makes sense. The story is so intricate, but I still seem to be able to follow. I can't wait for Jordan to write more of the series!"
5,A whole new world in a whole new age.,I find this book and the rest of the Wheel of Time series utterly fantastic. I couldn't put any of them down. Robert Jordan is a master at creating a whole new world in a whole new age. I find a bit of everything I love about reading in each of the books in the series.
4,The Great Hunt,"The Great Hunt by Jordan is an enthralling adventure tale that has to be one of the best examples of how to write a follow-up when the predescesor is the great Eye of The World. These books are very accessible to fans of fantasy and to those who value realism. Some may argue that they are grander in scope than Tolkien's masterful Lord of the Rings trilogy. This reviewer cannot and will not validate this most difficult of questions. They are both fantastic works. In the Great Hunt, we follow Rand al'Thor and his friends as they seek to eradicate the dark one and free the world of his tyranny. All the characters return from the first installment and there are some surprises from the modern day master of the art of fantasy writing, Robert Jordan. Trollocs, Fades, Aes Sedai and False Dragons abound in this extraordinary follow-up. If Eye of The World provided the imagination with color, The Great Hunt lets us paint the pictures."
4,"A real page turner, but too many pages (2)","This is a really well done fantasy / page turner, but way too long. I think I will just use the first book of ""The Wheel of Time"" in m next Fantasy Lit. Class."
4,Not a bad next book,Kinda knew where this one was going and while the back story of character struggles is important to the series it felt a bit slow at times. But the ending left your ready for the third book and fast!
4,An old friend,I am rereading this series. I missed the last few books so I decided to start from the beginning and read the entire series. It is like coming back to an old friend. This is fantasy at its best.
5,The Great Hunt,This is one of the best books that has come out in years! Jordan has very good character discription and great plots. Jordan writes with a rythme that makes it seem like you are there and the people are real!This book kept me up all night just trying to see what happens with the characters. I've read the book 5 times and it was just as good the last as it waas the first.
3,Much less enjoyable than the first novel.,"The problem with this novel is that, while it needs to show Rand and the other characters finding their way, it does so poorly. Rand takes forever to get moving; his character does little more than wander around with Loial and Selene for most of his chapters.At the same time, the characters seem to have progressed little, and some of them are honestly boring to read (unlike in the last book). This is sad, since most of them, although angry, or upset at being uprooted, or scared, actually felt like real people. They don't in this novel."
5,More top notch fiction/fantasy from Jordan,"This book improves even over the top-rateThe Eye of the World, developing more complexcharacters, and having previous ones return.A brilliant ending sets the stage for the nextbook."
3,Strange and fascinating,"This movie is really cool. It is a cheesy, short movie but it is funny. Rose McGowan plays a mute girl perfectly and seductively throughout the movie. The ending makes the movie come together. It says that you get what you deserve."
4,good little movies for weird movie lovers,"If you like movies with weird characters ,this is one of those films.2 convicts break out of jail.One is a lunatic with a gold map who enjoys killing people and the other a computer crime fellon who is non violent.Along the way they pick up sexy Rose McGowen who is a dumb mute,supposedly.A crazy crooked cop is chasing them to get the gold map.After much gory killing of all the main characters,sexy Rose emerges with a suprise.In the end we get another trick suprise.The movie keeps you guessing what will happen next.It is much better then rose McGowns Doom Generation if your considering both"
5,"Dark comedy, a little quirky, but a lot of fun!","My spouse and I both enjoyed this movie--so much so that we have driven through southern new mexico and the quiet little town of Hillsboro! Admittedly, not everyone will enjoy this movie, but it is one of my all time favorites that I still watch a couple of times every year!!!! Rose McGown is great!"
1,Not worth the dollar I paid for this mess...,It's difficult for me to imagine anyone really liking this. Unless they have not seen the many better movies this one attempts to emulate. Unless they enjoy poor acting. Unless they enjoy a movie with no original ideas. Unless they enjoy a movie with no real surprises. Unless they enjoy a movie in which they could care less about any of the characters.This is predictable fodder which was not worth the dollar...
3,hysterical roadtrip mishap!,"If you liked Thelma & Loiuse and anything Rose McGowan has starred in, then you'll find this movie interesting in the least. It has a bit of a bizzare twist but otherwise intriguing overall."
3,Decent B movie,I thought this cheap B movie would be... well...cheap.But this isn't a big budget movie with lots of explosions to liven things up.But it has it's lows.Rose Mcgowan is in this and doesn't do a lot of talking because she's mute but the other two guys can't shut up and overdo the acting which can be just as bad as not doing it at all.
3,guilty pleasure,This is a cute movie. Kind of a guilty pleasure simple and entertaining. Don't expect much just a few easy laughs. Plus I adore Rose McGowen.
3,"Good, but no Siroco","The last 4 tracks on this disc are great. The others are less of a showcase of Paco's immense talent. All things considered, it's worth picking up."
3,you can choose another XRCD,"Given the price paid for the high fidelity, this XRCD is probably not the best choice since I found the difference between this CD and the one originally issued by RCA was not that significant."
2,...,It was an ok book others helped me more you can help to visit theindigodream.org to learn more about how to help
4,Very good,This book was mich more than the supplement to the study guide that I purchased. It covered most of the information (at least at a high level) that the exam covers. For those that still don't feel comfortable with COM I would recommend the first five chapters of The COM/COM+ Primer.
4,A great prep book,"Lacey's explanations for COM are the best I have seen yet. In addition, his other explanations are clear and concise with good examples, good hints, and he shows you things that could trip you up on the exam. A winner"
3,"Good book, but becoming outdated","I just took the 70-016 and passed. This book helped, but now only covers about 50% of what is on the current exam (copyright 2000 - getting old). I HIGHLY recommend practice exams such as syngress and transcender. I would not have passed the exam without the practice exams...Good luck!"
4,Good for a beginner with small Java Experience,"Book is well organized. It covers most of the features. The examples are easy to follow. Easy to read. However it only covers features in the Professional Edition as the preface mentioned. Would've been better if it covered a little more advanced topics like visual servlets, cookies etc... Overal is good for learning but not for the advanced. I think I learned a lot from the book which has prepared me for the next level."
1,Poor Excuse for a Learning Guide,"Whenever I see a book that has the product name as part of the title and is not preceded with the words ""advanced"" or ""intermediary"" then I am led to believe that it will provide an broad introductory prospective to the product. I was dead wrong with this particular book. It reads like it was written in a weekend with each topic hastily reviewed with a major emphasis on scantily provided detail combined with large font types to give the visual appearance of an impressive body of work. Don't be fooled, this book is not worth the effort. You would be better served using the Visualage for Java help panels than attempting to apply any of the aspects of this book."
3,"Good software, book needs work","The book comes with VisualAge for Java pro version 2, which was a surprise. The book contains good information, but learning Java from the book is not easy, and is made more difficult by errors. Even as you start the very first project, a figure is misnumbered in the text, making even starting the software confusing. The authors would have been well-served by having someone use or proofread the book by going through the examples, figures, and directions to comment on their usability before publication."
2,In true redbook fashion - no explainations,"My main problem with this book is the fact that you are taken step by step throught the development process but with no explainations of why you are doing the step. They aren't teaching...its more like rote repitition. On top of this, there are several critical typos and since you don't know the what and whys, they are that much harder to uncover. This could have been a great tutorial if IBM didn't assume it was writting to super-techies. Next time guys...EXPLAIN THE STEPS!"
5,Very good portrayal of business-government relations,"This book excels as an easy to read and to understand primer for doing business in China. Many foreign businesses are unaware of the pitfalls and opportunities that lie in wait for them -- including the extensive reach of the Chinese government, and the cultural/historical factors behind this. Because of this, I recommend the Chinese Tao of Business as essential reading for any US company in China. As the authors also highlight cultural and social misperceptions that permeate our business decisions, it is probably also essential reading for any Chinese company doing business in the West. George Haley and Usha Haley have done an excellent and monumental job of communicating the complex Chinese business terrain."
2,Too Slow and No Real Plot,"I was very disappointed in this movie. Many, many of the scenes are way too long with no action or even narration. For example, there is one scene where the boy is looking out the door of a box car as the train is moving - and all you see are the trees and fields going by. Also, the story is very weak, if, indeed there is even a real story there. To me it was just a collection of encounters with various people along the way. The only reason I can see for one to watch this movie would be to get some glimpse of how the people live in Russia and the old Soviet Union."
4,"In the air, with certainty","In less than 200 pages Brackenbury creates characters who depend on their strength and conviction to carry them through the dreary hardship that turn most people into whiners. But these characters don't whine; they win. And they juggle (literally and figuratively) to explain life to themselves. Brackenbury, who is a poet, uses the tightness and verbal tension of poetry to create vignettes of landscape, personal and natural, that will stay with the reader long after the book is done. Each of the characters is a protagonist, each situation inevitable. There is great unity of purpose here. A young man's search for his mother is really a search for himself; a deserted lover's fierce focus on a vineyard is a fulfillment of self. A quick read, good and satisfying."
2,Buy it if you must,"I bought this for my son and I am sorry. He likes it, but found the buttons hard to press. Little Leap is also a bit too pushy - if you don't press buttons for a while it keeps egging you on to play which is very annoying for a child trying to think or struggling to push the buttons.Little Leap now sits with all the other not very much used stuffed animals.Buy it if you can afford to take the gamble - it seems that some kids like this toy."
5,Favorite toy of our 2-year-old...Worth the money!!,"We bought this toy for our daughter (not quite two) and she absolutely adores it. It's the toy she goes back to again and again. She had no problem figuring out how to press all the buttons, and grins from ear-to-ear whenever she sees it. She's been playing with it almost every day since we got it for her several months ago, and shows no signs of getting bored with it. If your child shows an interest in sounds/music, I highly recommend this toy!"
3,needs to be more clear,"This toy is cute and will entertain any child who likes baby tad. As for educational purposes, it is too difficult to discern between the ""c"" ""b"" ""v"" ""d"" and etc. This is always hard to find in toys but v-tech smart board is the best (the ""write n' learn smart board"" also will show the letter on a screen, say it clearly, and encourage child to write it) My son loves both toys which both go for $30. But for parents who buy the toy to teach get the v-tech."
4,Amazing teaching tool,My daughter received this toy for her first birthday but started playing with it at 16 months. She loves anything that plays music and the song is very catchy... I hum it all day! At 18 months she can tell me what sound about 20 of the 26 letters makes! She can also point to many of the letters if I ask her to. We were amazed that this toy could teach her so much at such a young age. We highly recommend it.
3,"Good idea, but difficult to use","This toy is a great idea, but it is very difficult to press the buttons on his front. Sometimes my 2 1/2 year old gets very frustrated because he correctly answers the question, but the toy does not respond since he did not press hard enough. It is even hard for me to press the letters on the edges! Also, it broke quickly: one of the hands no longer registers when a number is pressed."
5,I love toys that teach...,"Yes, I love toys that teach and I love this toy. Kids love music and songs and I think that that's the best way to teach. Froggie sings some catchy tunes while he teaches so the knowledge sticks. It also has a wonderful interactive feature that teaches while playing games. A nice response comes with a correct answer.Unfortunately the durabilty of this toy is poor. Don't hit the buttons hard enough and you won't get a response. Too hard and the toy can break. There is just too narrow a range between the two points. Still, it's an inexpensive toy so I don't mind having bought a second one."
2,Makes too much noise!,"The sounds that the frog makes are very ""tinny"" and it is hard to understand what he is saying. I need to look at the letters/picture buttons in order to understand the corresponding sounds. Although this toy turns itself off, all you need to do is touch it or have something bump into it for it to go back on again. Needless to say, it is a very annoying toy and I see little educational value."
3,I wish family would read age recomendations!,"I had Baby Tad on my daughters registry, mind you it was her 1st birthday, and strangely enough, Im not sure if by the help of Toys R Us employees, My Daughters Paternal Grandmother bought this. Im not saying its a bad toy for 2-5 year olds, but for a one year old its enough to boggle a maturing brain. I guess this is just for those people thinking that thier kids would appreciate this toy at a young age to learn the alphabet, but Its annoying to the parents when the wrong letter is hit, and the Frog says ""actually"" One year olds dont need to be saying actually, No is bad enough. Make sure you adhere to age specifications"
4,Simple; to the point,"This book is very thin, but don't let that throw you. The examples are easy to follow, and very concise. I just wish that there was a .NET version available."
3,ok leash,"I bought 3 of these, al the same. We needed a lighted leash and selected these. Functionally these are fine, the light and lock buttons could be a bit easier to operate, but hey, its a dog leash.... with a light... that works."
2,light broken,"got this for my mother as a gift for x-mas, we were all disappointed when the light did not work."
4,Fun-lite!,"This product is sure to bring a smile to every dog-lover's face!It was purchased as a gift, but so cute that I almost kept it myself.Fun and fuctional - way to go!"
1,The control botton does not work effeciently,Couldnt even give it away to anyone. This is a very cheaply made product that isnt worth any money as it is unsafe
2,Impossible to use,"The sound is great, the features fantastic, and you'll never be able to appreciate them, because the controls are impossible, and the manual worthless.Quick! Change the volume level of the center speaker. Just try. You'll have to push a button on the remote, after you push a button on the remote that isn't documented, then you'll be able to get to the control. The buttons for changing between 5.1 and 6.1 on the front panel, as well as the remote, are easy to find, for all you folks that swap out speaker systems daily. If you want to change balance, make a pot of coffee and a sandwich."
3,A/B is not the same as A+B,"I bought the receiver to replace my Harman Kardon HK3375, which was too deep to fit in my new shelves. Not only was the sound noticeably inferior to the HK, but it provided only ""A"" or ""B"" speakers but not at the same time. I spent all that time trying to find an inexpensive system that was shallow enough to fit my shelves, and somehow overlooked the inability to play in two rooms at the same time. Add to that the confusing interface. Anyway, this failure pushed me to find a different place to install my existing HK."
2,bummer,"This is not the same album as I had it in the 1990's. Songs are different, sleeve is printed on a home computer... Too bad, cuz it was one of my favorite albums in the early 90's."
4,Summer Will Show,"Summer Will Show is Sylvia Townsend Warner's most bold lesbian novel. The book uses numerous scenes and even characters from other great English novels such as Great Expectations. After Sophia Willoughby loses her children to smallpox, she goes to find her husband with his mistress in Paris. She finds them both and his mistress Minna and Sophia find themselves unnaturally drawn to each other. Eventually they find themselves to be soulmates and both become actively involved in the French Revolution. The book contains the wonderful style and metaphors characteristic of Sylvia Townsend Warner. A must-read for Warner fans."
4,Fun game if it runs properly on your system,"This game has been a rollercoaster for me since purchasing it. At first, it ran way too fast. All of the movement and cutscenes seemed to run at double speed, which of course made playing the game tough. Granted, this is an old game, and running it on a newer system with dual CPUs proved to be too much. Finally, I realized that setting the affinity to one CPU enabled the game to run properly. I have not finished the game, but it presents with a great atmosphere, (although a little campy), and has generally been a solid FPS for me so far. You must take into account that this is an old game and can't stand up to Crysis, Bioshock or the like, but if you like retro games like me, this is a good, solid pick up, just make sure you're able to run it properly on your system."
