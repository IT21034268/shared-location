3,"A ""Usual"" day","This film shows the enormous frustrations, disappointments, and overall soul-killing life in modern Palestine. It follows an educated ex-legal Judge who has returned to his town and, while waiting for appointment as a city official, is reduced to driving a taxi.""Abu Laila"" has a wife and a seven year old daughter who's birthday celebration will happen in the evening of his ""usual"" day on the job. He drives through the city taking people places and witnessing their lives and their issues. He understands all too well the short-comings of the population and the whys and wherefores of the difficulties of their lives within the Israeli-occupied country.It is not a polemic by any means; there is some sardonic humor and also a quite nice driving tour in a place where most of us, sadly, will never visit. Watch it for what you can learn about the place and the people."
1,very deceiving,"Gee I wonder why people are confusing this Rap album with a heavy metal band. Maybe cause it has the same name and practically the same logo? This version has initials instead of a real word, so I could see people mistaking it for the metal band, but when you (Amazon) offer a discount if you buy both CD's (Down II and this rap crap) that's misleading and is causing people to buy something they don't want. And since there's no way to contact Amazon, they can do what they want I guess"
1,This is NOT DOWN from NOLA,These people are right and it is wrong that these people are making money selling a album with an Artist name of DOWN 8 years after the real band DOWN released their albums NOLA & DOWN II.This is (c)RAP music and has nothing to do with the talented music that we have seen from the real DOWN in the past and soon to be future.Amazon should not be associating this album with the real DOWN just because someone else chose to copy the name.
1,"THIS AIN'T PHIL, PEPPER, KIRK, and JIMMY!","This is not the Metal band DOWN! It is RAP. This poor guy probabley can't sell his music on Amazon because he's been lumped in with my favorite band from the south. Bottom line if you love metal this is not for you. It may well be a fine rap cd but I wouldn't know, as I am a metal head!"
2,Gawd....,"I really, really, really hope no one out there thinks that's Phil Anselmo on the cover.Buyers BEWAAARE!!!! Mwa hahahaha ha haaaa!!!"
3,Shady,"I'm not against the rapper using his name as DOWN but for amazon to offer a special deal if you purchase bustle in your hedgerow, which is a completely different genre, its pretty shady. It appears to be a scam by someone."
2,Down AKA Kilo,"Seems like these other dudes has mistaken this CD for being a rock release. Well, it isnt. Matter of fact it's latino rapper Down AKA. Kilo who is on this.The rapper Down is average at best in my opinion, he has not got much flow and his rhymes are tiredsome. The features on this record is not to be messed with though: Kam, Tha Eastsidaz, MC Ren, Kokane, Snoop, Suga Free, Bad Azz, Daz Dillinger and more.I would say this is a good record for the featured artist, but Down himself cannot hold this up. Might be good for latino rap-fans though"
4,Good product,The CD including paper covers & cd booklet were like new. Product shipped & was received in a reasonable amount of time. Very satisfied.
3,i liked it,"i bought it for the tunes ""right down the line"" and ""baker street"" but found a couple of other songs i havent heard but liked ""whatever's written in your heart"" a piano accompanied tune with soul."
2,How Annoying!,"Very dissapointed. If you're going to remix a song, tell the buyer on the disc cover. It's notated nowhere on the outside. I put the disc in and knew immediately I was screwed. I wanted the original tunes, not the remix. Ughh."
3,Re-mixed Baker Street a dissapointment,"If you're planning to buy this disc for any of the first three tracks, forget it. They're re-mixes, and pale compared to the original. And, of course, they don't tell you they're re-mixes until you've broken the seal and read the liner notes. It sounds like the re-mix engineer, Martyn Heyes, was trying for a warm, ""British"" sound. He failed to do that, but he did succeed in making Rafferty sound like he was singing out of a cardboard box. Stick with the originals."
2,I expected a little more....,"This book is monotonous, explaining the same thing repeatedly. All patterns were so similar that if you had one of the patterns, you'd have them all."
3,too short for a such a great subject,"You really can't get into this movie. It's too short, and could have been more in depth.That's not to say it's not interesting...I just wish it could have been longer, and I wish the producers would have taken better advantage of the IMAX techology..."
1,A Disappointment,"A the very start, of the narration, I could tell this was below average. The actor tells of a village on the banks of the Mississippi, Hannibal, ""a little democracy which was full of liberty, equality, and the forth of July"". Not a quote I would choose for accuracy, even if those were Twain's words. You have to imagine how former slaves recalled that village, however few slaves it had.Speaking of the actor, his attempt to sound old got old right quick. I'd sooner hear more of Twain's words than his voice.Many of the old photos seemed to have barely any connection to Mark Twain. For example, black and white children together on a donkey. I'm not convinced young Samuel ever saw that happen.Some of the modern scenes were interesting, I have to say, but they don't save the final product. BTW, contrary to the editorial review, there is no scene selection.I don't know why anyone, myself included, ever thought this was an IMAX subject. Never the Twain shall meet IMAX and mix well."
1,Dangerous for Children,"When I removed the tambourine from the package, the pins holding the cymbals fell out. They apparently were not affixed to the wood in any way. The pins are thin and about an inch long. I ordered two tambourines (for twins) and both had this problem. Certainly a choking hazard for children."
5,Great for all ages,This instrument is a toy that is enjoyed by all ages from baby to 100! We all have a lot of fun with it. It's very durable. It provides lots of fun and music enjoyment for a small price and a small footprint in your home.
5,A collection of friendly-themed acoustic guitar songs,"The debut children's music CD by 15-year independent musician Leonardo Biciunas, Makin' Lemonade is a collection of friendly-themed acoustic guitar songs that emphasize imagination, self-esteem, safety, and the wonder of nature. An overall theme of optimism and hope, as embodied by the well-known saying ""When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!"", shines through in this joyful family-friendly audio experience. The tracks are ""Snow Day""; ""Yankee Doodle""; ""Do It Myself""; ""Mind to Migrate""; ""Tools""; ""Shake It Off""; ""The Bee Goes Buzz""; ""Makin' Lemonade""; ""Computer Ate My Homework""; ""Ocean Blue""; ""How Did the Chicken Cross the Road?""; ""Layers""; ""Deep in Mama's Heart""; and ""Believing in the Child"". Run time: 42:12."
4,Mike Gordon can't stoop me!,"Bane is unlike anything i have ever heard. Mike gordon lets his alter ego loose in this bass driven album whoose rough edges and intriguing arrangements make for a bizzare listen. If you are not sure about this album, do a little research about ""Joey Arkenstat"" (first seen on Deep End) and you will stumble into the strange world of Mike Gordon. I don't want to give to much away but everything about this album is very cool conceptually."
4,Bloch almost at his best,"There was no beating Psycho. Psycho II came close with the ""is Norman dead or not"" clause. Psycho House says, ""Yes, Norman's dead, but try telling Norman that."" Even after the death of Robert Bloch, Norman Bates still lives on. Psycho House shows us that. It shows us that even if the body of a person is no more, his legend lives on forever. An Excellent novel with a few loose strings that now, since it's creator has died, only our imaginations are left to fix."
3,Four Disney comedies starring Kurt Russell,"Before Kurt Russell went into drama and action films, he had a decent career with teh Disney studios. Presented here are four of those films: The Strongest Man in the World, The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, The Horse in the Grey Flannel and Now You See Him Now You Don't. The only other Disney films featuring Russell missing here are The Barefoot Executive and Superdad. Of the four aforementioned in this collection, the best film is the dramatic/light comedy film, The Horse in the Grey Flanel in which Russell is in a supporting role. The funniest of the films is Now You See Him Now You Don't. Watch these four films and enjoy some wholesome films starring a decent actor."
4,An interesting read,"I liked the whole angle this book took. The first hand accounts are pretty solid. I recommend this for the collection...along with ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" by Chris Warner...another great tome for die hard SEC fans like me."
1,I found this book frustrating to read...a big disappointment,"I found this book frustrating to read. First, the writing is disjointed. The author jumps to new topics without transitions or comments on the many quotes. Second, and related to the first point, this is more of an edited volume of quotes, not an authored book with original ideas. Third, it is noteworthy to this reader that the author interprets his own failed marriage and Jung's affairs with patients as psychological growth, whereas Freud's affair with his sister-in-law was an opportunity to criticize Freud's emphasis on sex in his psychoanalysis. For readers interested in the topics of Tao and Jung, this book is likely to be a huge disappointment."
2,Introspective of Jung; lacks in originality.,"The book has an interesting premise, and the reader is thrown a great many details about Jung's personal life. However, the editing is horrible. There is very little original thought by the author because 80% of the book is either excerpts of Jung's personal journal, or Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching. The other 20% are phrases that poorly setup the quotation to follow. To give you an idea of how much he quotes (rather than interpreting and regurgitating), his references section consists of 19 pages."
4,Great Product,"I have used Symantec and McAfee. I shopped and compared anti-virus products after Symantec brought my machine to a halt. After lots of calls, unsuccessful un-installs, the only way to solve the Symantec problems was to get rid of it and do a clean Windows XP install - re-format the hard drive. Never again Symantec!After a lot of reviews I chose BitDefender. I had one glitch in installation, but talking to a REAL LIVE TECH SUPPORT PERSON (amazing!) on the phone solved that.It has been fine. If it is slower than any other programs, I don't notice it on downloads and the scans are done nightly while I sleep.Appears to be effective, simple and stable."
2,Unstable / Slows machine down,"I've been using Bitdefender V10 for about 10 months and found it to be very unstable. One day it'll preform perfectly and the next day it will not allow an update or maybe it will simply allow a scan without realtime protection. It also slows the machine to a snails pace and Customer Support? Forget it! Customer support is non-existent. I've email their so called SUPPORT, a number of times, to report the problems I'm experiencing and never received so much as an acknowledgement. I would not recommend it!"
1,"putrid, pathetic product","This is a product fully deserving of *zero* stars if Amazon had their rating system set up to give that score...if you didn't see the cover of the DVD case, you might thing this was a longggggggggggggggggggg and boringggggggggggggg infomercial for a certain hang-gliding, lightweight aircraft business located in NC, but you sure wouldn't think it was a ""scenic"" tour of the state...in fact, you see almost nothing of the scenic beauty that the state does possess, but you see a lot of trashy, side-of-the-road-tourist-trap type ""scenery""...cheaply done, cheaply made...do NOT waste money on this thing. I'll never buy anything else produced by the makers of this product. Ever."
3,NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING,"ALTHOUGH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED WAS INTERESTING, WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IT WAS MORE OF NORTH CAROLINA TRAVEL AND STATE INFORMATION VIDEO. LANDSCAPES, TOURISM INFORMATION, STATE INFORMATION AS FOR RELOCATION, WEATHER, REGIONS TO VISIT, ETC.. I WAS LOOKING FOR A MORE COMPLETE VIDEO. IF YOU KNOW ANY VIDEO WHICH MIGHT HELP ME IN THESE AREAS PLEASE LET ME KNOW. THANKS IN ADVANCE."
1,The Greatest Farce Ever Written,"Never letting the facts get in the way of a good story, author Frost can't correctly tell you the location of Royal St. George's GolfClub (it ain't southwest of London), or what Young Tom Morris's wife died of (cholera?! it was childbirth), but he pretends to know the innermost thoughts of Harry Vardon and Francis Ouimet, consistently fabricating both dialogue and stream of consciousness. The unmitigated gall! Forget the eight forced similes per page, the sappy sentimentality of the writing, and the miss-spellings (La Tourquet for Le Touquet!) in this novel and purchase the authoritative ""Harry Vardon"" by Audrey Howell. I didn't just put this book down after a mere 120 pages, I threw it away. I simply couldn't tell what was fact or fiction. On the other hand, Hollywood should love this made-for-television version that was written by a make-believe golf historian."
5,Fantastic must-read for golfers,As a ouimet alum it is a privilege to read and reread the life and times of a truly one of a kind man.
5,Greatest Game Review,If you've ever loved golf you'll love to read this. I didn't know it was a book I couldnt put down. Author has a great narrative style. You almost feel like you are there...on a scale of 1-5 it is a 10!!
4,No mess oil drain hose,This drain hose makes it very easy to change oil in my riding lawn mower.. Before the oil would run on the rear tire and make a big mess... now it drains in the oil recycled oil bucker.
3,Well made product,"This item is well made but was unable to use it on my B & S engine in my Craftsman lawn tractor due to the steering linkage configuration. I suppose that it will work well on my Generator engine but have not attempted to use it yet. If looking to buy this item for use on Lawn tractors with B & S engines, please examine closely for clearance of steering linkage at the oil drain plug site."
4,Warrick,"Marilyn Harris always surprises me every time I read one of her books, that is why I like this one. Warrick deals with a disfunctional family out in the oil fields of Oklahoma. They all have a hate/love relationship that money tore apart and death will bring them back together. If ""Dallas"" was your favorite show on TV then you will love this one."
4,Good Reading,"Good storyline, very informative on subject matter. Also fun and entertaining.Also good receipes."
4,"""An Industry of pleasure""","Too Dark Park is a well chiseled industrial album full of heavy disciplined mayhem! Not too many other industrial bands have the ability of keeping due measure. Crafted with such intensity, that is David Ogilvies' nature. Well introduced, though with some minor low fi beats initialy, this album continues to pick up speed and progress non-stop! Good stuff, the album fits the fashion of industrial rock. Cool to listen to after experiencing live perfromances of Ogre with ministry in both 88 and 89!"
2,Primal programming pungency,"2 1/2For early-era, brutishly blossoming, repetitiously shrill industrial, this layered affair still only deserves a percentage of accolades it receives."
5,Tasty,"this CD is very tasty, it is over the world that i am away from it. only then will i find it. It's not what you find out about, but only what you don't know. When you climb to the top of a mountain, keep climbing. This is a ""Rivetting"" work of art. It pounds your brain and is riddled with darkness and slight pierces of light. Nature's Revenge. Morpheus Laughing. Nuff Said. Long live the kings of Industrial Music. Listen to Wolf Eyes and Einsturzende Neubauten as well. You should like that if you like this. Light Bulb Swallow, life is hollow. Go away my pretties, my pet. I am not."
5,Great cold cup,I have been using Copco cups for a year now and love them. I just bought this one as a Christmas gift and the person recieving it was very excited because they had heard good reviews for the company and their products.
3,"It's okay, but doesn't keep drinks cold, even wtih ice","I had high hopes for this, given the positive reviews. I bought it to use at work. It's nice and spill-proof, which is good, but doesn't keep my tea any colder than a regular glass, which is really disappointing."
4,"Effective, but girly","From a functional standpoint, this tumbler is awesome. The lid seals tight, the straw does not fall out, and it keeps your drink cold for a long time.That said, the design is a bit, well, girly. My bad that I didn't look closer at the image prior to purchase. There's a pattern on both the grip and the straw, kind of a mod floral design. If the hand grip and straw were free from this embellishment, I'd use this thing anywhere. As it is, I'll probably give it to a female friend or relative."
3,Disappointed,"This travel cup is ok but nothing to rave about. I find you really have to be careful putting the lid on and get a good seal or it will leak and drip. It doesn't keep drinks colder longer...ice melts just as fast as a regular glass. I do like that it doesn't ""sweat"" and make a puddle under the cup. Overall, the quality of the product does not merit the price. I wouldn't recommend it to buy."
1,Missing Straw,I ordered six of these in different colors to give to the teachers at my kids' daycare. Five came with straws. The one purple one did not. Hope the replacement gets here in enough time to give the gifts before Christmas.
5,Finally a cold beverage cup WITH A STRAW that doesn't spill! YAY!,"Have looked high and low for a cold beverage cup (with a straw) that I can use anywhere, anytime, that keeps things cold but BEST OF ALL, when I knock it over in the car or on my desk, NOT A DROP comes out. Lately, I've been trying to drink more water, as everybody is recommending this for health benefits. It's always been hard for me to get the full quota of 8 glasses a day in. Not with my Copco cup. I can just keep sipping on it throughout the day/refill/repeat. It keeps things cold down to the last drop! It fits nicely in my car beverage holder, but sometimes I put it in my lunch bag that I take to work. When the bag falls on the floor of my car or gets knocked over by another package, NO WORRIES. I'm ordering one in every color. Best cold beverage mug EVA!"
5,A Great remake !,I think this is a great remake of the 1930's film and David Nevan and June Allyson are splendid in it. It's enteraing and as good as the orginal. I highly recommend it.
1,"Great concept, poor application.","We love Mad Libs on paper. We thought the card game would be equally amusing and help our kids with sentence construction. However, the rounds went rather quickly. An opportunity to draw a replacement card only came around every other round or so, as someone was usually dealt the prescribed number of sentences and required components. They then played their sentences and ended the round.We were very disappointed and probably will not play again."
3,Mentally disturbed,"What was he doing that he did not film to provoke the bear? This individual was sick. He should have not been allowed to roam out there for his own sake. His family and friends should have interviened. He grew antisocial, and delusional. I think he may have tried to get to close to the bear, HER name was Amy? He kept saying how much he loved them. That he was all that and a bag of grass. Guess he should have brought a 30-06 with him, you know, just in case. Losing his life was not worth the bears."
5,Beautiful and Heartbreaking,"This is a beautiful film about madness, bears and Alaska.Some of the most beautiful nature photography ever filmed with the madness of Timothy Treadwell.One of my favorite documentaries. A gorgeous fil, set in Kodiak Island, of a man who thinks he is one with the Grizzly Bear.And ""Coyotes"" is one of my favorite songs of all time.One of the best films I have seen in the last decade. I need to see more Werner Herzog films."
5,The man with the weakest mind,"Timothy Treadmill was a complete idiot. He was such an idiot that I could not completly watch this documentary. I can see why he never had companionship, in the wild a female would have viewed him weak and mentally defective. I love animals, wild and domestic, but I have the common sense to know my boundaries with them, you do not mess with wild bears, you leave them alone. The Fox can become like a domesticated dog, he had to be feeding it or something because they dont just hang around because they love you, but they can give you companionship like a dog. All I can say is Timothy Treadmill was nuts and if he and his girlfriend did anything good for the wild bears it was providing them with extra nurishment before the winter set in, The fox probably came bck also and got a snack. I gave this film 5 stars for for the stupidness man on earth"
1,Protector of Bears,"This is a sad movie about someone who has mental issues and is in the wilderness with grizzly bears and vows to protect them...from what ? Too bad the bears didn't know Timothy was their protector, then they wouldn't have eaten him. At least it taught me one thing, bears are dangerous and you really should avoid them. I think Timothy did more damage then good, now those grizzly bears think all humans are like Timothy Treadwell."
3,Nut-bag,"I work up in Kodiak, Alaska 5 months out of the year and I am in the company of bears often. The locals keep a respective distance from the bears. I too enjoy taking pictures and videos but the ""Grizzly Man"" was a total fool to think he could interact with these creatures. These are top level predators that will look at you one day, lay down near you the next day and then rip you to pieces whenever they want. The fool in the video attempts to humanize nature so he could ""bond"" with the bears. I hate to say it but in the video he quotes ""I would die for these bears"" Well guess what...no surprise there.Other than that the video is passibly interesting but the interviews drone on and on. If you need a cautionary tale to show the kids what not to do with nature then get a copy, but save yourself some money and borrow a copy from a library, or heck i will send you mine."
2,Please Don't Feed the Bears,"I had high expectations of Grizzly Man as it made it to the big screen. I was quite disappointed. Grizzly Man fails as a wildlife documentary because Timothy Treadwell didn't have the qualifications or expertise to produce such a thing. Grizzly Man falls short as a biography because Mr. Treadwell was in no way great or inspiring. However, he was nuts. Those interested in seeing a self-deluded, poor man's Crocodile Hunter destroy himself may find some value in this film. Most people would probably find time tuned in to the Discovery Channel to be time better spent."
2,Pretty much unwatchable...,"When the focus is on bear behavior it's fascinating, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. Unfortunately this film, like Treadwell's actions, isn't about the bears. It's about Treadwell.I've never seen a guy so much in love with himself, he's a poser, a Marlin Perkins wannabe. You can tell he wants National Geographic funding so bad he can taste it.Unfortunately his desires ended up getting himself and his girlfriend killed."
5,"treadwell is crazy, but the experience is spectacular","this movie follows the life of timothy treadwell as he lived in the alaskan wilderness and thought he was helping to raise the awareness of the plight or his perception of the grizzly bears on kodiak island in Alaska. Werner Herzog does a splendid job of relaying the information of treadway's life and leaves one with an interesting portrait of the man, and in some ways what would posess this lunatic to think he could live with grizzly bears in the wilderness,but also lets you witness the effect treadway had on others lives. Definitely worth seeing, it is a great film, and Mr. Chocolate and Saturn may have been Timothy Treadwell's friends, but to others they are just bears!"
3,Death Wish Man,"I rented this expecting a ""Jane Goodall"" story. Instead, we get this wack-o fringe kind of guy, the sort you meet when you're still single and living in a large city. Except that he took his schism to extremes by living among giant carnivores. I used to hunt in Grizzly Bear country (The Kootenai Plains in Alberta, Canada) believe me, only a bona fide nut would choose to camp in wild bear country.Three couples watched this film last night after we had made last minute Super Bowl preparations. None in the room felt any compassion for Treadwell. He got what he wanted, we should all be so lucky.At points, the film was almost like watching an old SCTV sketch. Here's a guy who read up on a small Outback town so that he could pass himself off as an intinerant Australian!!! Shades of Travis Bickle. You do have to feel sorry for his parents, though; common, decent people who raised a crackpot for a son.Defintely worth watching, either as an exercise in psychology or for some beautiful scenery."
1,Awful documentary,I thought that this movie would be more interesting. It is not for children and this documentary is poorly done.
3,Expectations,1)This guy was such a phony with the kindergarten/gay voice on cam and then the cursing off. 2)Could not wait to see this guy get eaten. 3) Such a downer when they did not edit in the actual deathroe sounds. I root for mother nature always.
5,"EXTREMELY DISTURBING, NOT FOR KIDS.",But well worth watching. It doesn't exactly paint a pretty picture of liberal PETA types like myself. This guy is crazy. Out of touch with the real world. Probably a gay man in denial(you'll see what I mean when you watch this). Definitely in denial about the danger of hanging out with grizzly bears. There is a haunting segment of him on David Letterman. Letterman asks if one day we'll read about him being eaten which he laughs off. But of course he does end up as an early dinner one evening. It is a shame what has become of the grizzly bears in the continenal United States. Losing their majestic habitats for shopping malls and ski resorts. I'm not sure this film supports the cause to repopulate them but it is a fascinating film that shows a man on fire without taking a stance one way of the other.
3,GRIZZLY MAN,"THE DVD IS BASED ON A TRUE EVENT THAT TAKES PLACE OVER A THIRTEEN YEAR PERIOD, IN THE ALASKA WILDERNESS. ACUTALLY OVER 13 SUMMERS IN ALASKA. THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER AND A FRIEND DIED AS A RESULT OF TEMPTING MOTHER NATURE, SO TO SPEAK. THE ENTIRE FILM SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OF A NEWS STORY THAN A DOCUMENTARY. AN THE DOCUMENTARY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BASED ON A PERSON, BECOME A VICTIM OF HIS OWN MENTAL ILLNESS. WHILE WATCHING THE FILM YOU CLEARLY SEE THE ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOR GROWING AND THE UNSTABLENESS OF THIS PERSON BECOMING MORE AND MORE EVIDENT. IN ALL I WOULD SAY THAT THE FILM WAS 100 MINUTES TO LONG (OUT OF THE 104 MINUTES). THE PICTURES OF THE WILD LIFE AND THE ALASKAN SCENERY ARE THE ONLY REASON FOR THE RATING OF THREE."
1,"Herzog, &#65533;where were your mind?","This documentary is not about bears. It?s about a man who thought was a bear. And he?s totally out of his mind. The whole story is crazyness, but the bad and boring one.Don?t buy this, go straight to ""March of the pinguins"" instead."
2,Disappointing,"Timothy Treadwell's obsession about the Grizzly and about himself taught him nothing about the bears - new bear and new territory...a tragedy in the making for both bear and man. Two bears had to be killed because of Timothy's ignorance.If you think you will be seeing ten years work of wonderful filming you will be disappointed. If on the other hand you enjoy seeing a self appointed, angry and silly guardian of the Grizzly self destruct, this film is for you. That the `documentary' won a Sundance award will come as no surprise."
2,Didn't make the cut.,"Found it boring and certainly not worth the time to sit through, we only got about 10 minutes into the presentation before deciding it wasn't worth watching."
3,Dissapointing!!,"I watched this show awhile back and was totally dissapointed with the show. First this guy is outside of his mind, and needed some serious help from Doctors in the mental healthcare fields. Who in their right mind goes and lives with grizzly bears for seven summers, and thinks that nothing is bad is going to happen to you? These bears don't know the difference between a human and food, to them a human is food. To think that he could live with them, and I got the feeling that he really did believe that the bears accepted him as part of the pack, is to epitome of ridiculous and stupid. The worst part being that he was selfish enough that he didn't just put himself into this deadly situation, but put his girlfriend into it to. Ultimately costing both of them their lives. I found this show to be very boring, and the one part that you wanted to see they wouldn't show. Of course that being where the bear finally got tired of this joker and ate him."
4,Grizzly Man is great!,"A must see for all film buffs, ""real"" people who seem like charactersin a wacky film"
2,Who are you protecting?,"Timothy Treadwell the manic-depressive is the real story hear. After watching this movie I felt disturbed. Not from the bear mauling thing, but because this guy is a wack job. WTF is wrong with him. You never get the full story about his past. He is obviously repressing some emotions. This is not a nature movie in the typical sense, its star is not the bears but Timothy's psychological disorders. The highlight of this freak show is watching him get frisky with bear turds. Also he is supposed to be the bear's protector yet he stands idly by as tourist throw large rocks at the bear. FYI, not all bears like to be sweet-talked. They are wild animals that don't like humans encroaching on their space and they will eat your face."
1,Be prepared to be annoyed,"This character seems borderline psychotic at times and shows no regard for anyone but himself and animals. At one point in this movie a bear wandered within 20 yards of fishers and they threw a rock at it to scare it away, this caused Tim to become irate and pretentiously condemn people who were just protecting themselves, they could have just as easily (and legally) shot the bear but they chose to scare it. Those people are true nature lovers, not this crazed fanatic. This man died in a way very fitting for the way he lived, he treated animals like civilized creatures instead of wild animals, and at least his death teaches us a lesson, bears are not rational creatures, they are wild animals who will kill humans. Treat animals with more respect than this lunatic did."
3,good eats?,"If you can get past the bouncing retard, the scenery is beautiful.Don't get me wrong, he was plenty funny...but I really wanted to watch him and his gal get removed from this earth in true Darwinian style.This flick has plenty of over-acting, and the psycho ex was a riot.Once again, the background is stunning."
4,Treadwell as a hunter,"When i was watching this documentary i couldn't help but think, is this about grizzley's or a man searching for something untouched, untainted? By the end i had realized this is more of a journey into the mind, and the ability to find new ways to cope with personal problems through what has been there all along. Timothy Treadwell does this through relatively dangerous means but succeeds none the less. R.I.P. Timothy Treadwell."
1,A terrible blow for the Grizzly Bear reputation,"Clearly the man was insane and is desperate for attention. He supposedly cared for the bears which I imagine in his own warped way he did. However, by placing himself in such a dangerous position (note how he hypes up that danger by constantly telling us) and getting himself killed he's put back the work done by Charlie Russell and other real bear conservationists by adding to the big bad bear false reputation. If you actually want to really learn something about bears and not some hero talking to a camera about his babies etc then ignore this lame Hollywood drama and watch 'Bear Man Of Kamchatka"" on BBC DVD."
5,Amazing,"I Have Never Laughed So Hard In My Life. If you like comedy DVD's this is a must own. I personally would change his name from trendwell to tastewell. I have looked for countless hours to find the pan his girlfriend Amy used to hit the bear with on Ebay.This movie has inspiried me. I have built a tent in my bedroom and live with stuff bears. Surely not quite as bold as ""Timothy."" I often read the bible late at night. I usually skip to the section about ""Timothy.""I Have purchased this dvd and watch it when I excercise I put the dvd into my player when im on the treadmill. It makes me run faster cause I make believe theirs a bear chasing me.For years I my family has called my grandfather ""Grandpa Timmy."" I was embarassed, but now i find that it is okay for a man that age to be referred to as ""Timmy.""and last but not least, i am gonna watch Rachel Ray make a 30 minute meal entitled ""Timothy Treadwell"""
2,What a let down,"We expected this to be about a person dedicated to the well being of the bear population in Alaska. It turns out to be about a guy who was living in another reality and thinking the real bears were cuddly teddy bears. Its amazing he didn't die sooner. Sorry. The guy was a nutcase.However, it was a well put together documentary and we DID watch the whole thing."
2,What a load.,"This guy Treadwell was a self-serving prick. He claimed to be ""protecting"" animals all through this piece of crap, but how exactly? Yeah, I like bears too, but I'm not going to intrude on them the way he did. His 5-minute long swearing at the Parks Service was nothing more than childish pandering to those who know no other way to criticize the government. This movie was a colossal waste of time made by an egotistical clown who had no respect for the fact that he was made of bear food."
2,Move along,"The subject of the film is obviously suffering from mental problems that cause him to shy away from the civilized world and to only feel a sense of belonging with wild animals such as foxes and bears. If I had purchased the film and not borrowed it from the library I would almost feel as though I were exploiting someone with a mental defect.My main issue with the film is that the director was biased in that he was attempting to cast the subject and his plight in the best light rather than a neutral tone that documentaries usually have. This was to the detriment of the film because although the attempt was made to portray the subject as a conservationist, he simply came across as a crazy person.Don't buy it, if you must see it, get it from the library."
4,Read the Book,"Read the book by Nick Jans ""The Grizzley Maze"". Excellent well balanced account of Timothy Treadwell and his passion for the coastal brown bears of Katmai National Park. Allot of first accounts of individuals who knew Treadwell from National Park Service individuals and guides who considered him a friend, to those who thought he was playing with fire.""Grizzley Man"" was a good film and prompted me to read more about Treadwell. Yes, the film showed his indiosyncrasies and some individuals came off strange, but none were actors with the exception of Treadwell. I would recommend the DVD but read the book it fills in quite a bit. It gives more depth to Timothy treadwell. It reminds me that for every Treadwell there is a individual in this world who would have no qualms in poaching a bear"
1,Not-So-Good,"A documentary of a home-grown nut-job that deliriously thought he was either a bear, would die & become a bear or protector of bears. He never really made up his mind, because he didn't really have a manageable brain. A man that could go from saying ""I love you"" to a wild grizzly bear to totally freaking out yelling profanity @ Park Rangers on his video camera while alone is not quite right in the head. Apparently Treadwell was manic most likely. He did manage to hook a crunchy gf too, but she gets killed as well. And the moral of this story is - it's not okay to be crazy like this nut-job in the wild with grizzlies, but acceptable if it makes for good entertainment & pass it off for a documentary. Where is good old fashioned entertainment & creative films anymore?"
3,let's be real,"i almost don't want to review this for fear of speaking ill of the dead.obviously he was a nature lover and free thinker and peace loving human being.i respect that and more people should strive to be that way.however, when watching this film i was struck by the totally unrealistic way he approached the bears.bears will eat anything and they don't care if you're for peace and unity or not.granted, there are some ""nice"" bears but to try and live as a grizzly bear is stupid."
2,accidentally hilarious!,"How someone could take this movie seriously is beyond me. What makes this movie funnier than Chistopher Guest films, and at the same time disturbing, is that it is a real documentary. This is like a new genre of entertainment! Timothy Treadwell had no mission! He was a dilusionary man that saw bears as cute human children in bear suits. Thats it! He got off on the rush these animal gave him. Thus violating and mocking nature without even knowing it. I thought this movie had to be a mockumentary, but it was not. I found myself laughing through the whole thing because I couldnt believe it was real!!!! Check it out."
2,Overrated. Invasion of privacy.,"I turned off the movie with about 20 minutes left. Herzog usesprivate material from Mr. Treadwell to do a layman's psychologicalprofile of him. This is an invasion of privacy and overall is deplorable. It's also twisted how he focuses a lot of time on the gruesome death and details, including the audio tape. If done with respect, this could have been an interesting, although more pedestrian documentary. Herzog goes for shock value and thru hype and violations of privacy exploits this unique individual."
5,"if there's a god, let it RAIN!!!!","so, was this movie supposed to be funny? i laughed most of the way through it. obviously timothy treadwell should have been on medication. He was severly bi-polar and most of the time he was deluded. I stared awestruck as i endured his endlesss rants about the rangers of the park, and when he thought that the poachers would be killing his ""friendly"" bears next summer. When he wanted to take ""action shots"" with different bandanas was where i realized that he thought of himself as a superstar. This reminded me of Waiting for Guffman. (a christopher guest movie) i almost thoght it was a mocumentary, and christopher guest would have a hard time tryign to make this movie any funnier. wow. i give this movie five strars for it's unintentional humor."
2,Very disturbing film on many levels,"I watched this movie last evening...well, to be honest, after the first hour, I skimmed through the rest as it was more of the same over-dramatized interviews and manic sound bites from Treadwell. The interviews with Jewel and the coroner were just as disturbing as the story itself as they both seemed like scenes from a bad soap opera.I wish the film maker had given Treadwell's mental and life history earlier in the movie as I spend much of the first half hour thinking, ""Is this man serious? What is wrong with him? Why hasn't anyone tried to get him some help?"" Clearly his friends and family saw his mental instability. It's so sad his life had to end so tragically and another human being lost her life as well.Still, I imagine if I muted the film, much of the footage might take on new meaning without Treadwell's distracting commentary. Nature in all its splendor and shadow is to be admired and respected."
3,DEATH OF A LOON,"This is a well-made and, in spots, touching documentary; it's a pity Treadwell's portrayal of himself is so far over the top that it's hard to find much real sympathy for him. He seems to have lived in his own reality, which unfortunately was clearly not the bears' reality. Transitions from ranting and raving to weeping, to spying on people who had the nerve to visit what is after all a national park...Treadwell is all over the place and his actual message seems to be simply ""Look at Me! Look at me!"" I'm sorry for what happened to him, and even sorrier for Amie Huguenard, whose only mistake, I think, was trusting Treadwell. The footage of the bears is excellent - shot by Treadwell - he was a talented photographer. Interviews with his friends and acquaintances too often are maudlin and overly worshipful. On the whole, it's an interesting portrayal of a sad and seriously unstable young man and a sad, almost wraith-like woman."
3,"Complete nutter, but hilariously funny (unintentionally I assume) in its parts","I totally agree with those who commented on the strange humour this movie portrays. Every single character in the movie (except maybe the ""bush pilot"") has something very strange to them. The corononer and the way they filmed him should have gone into Blair Witch Project, his ex girlfriend is the one who should have been with Timmy on that last day, they went very well together methinks (well, in a way, they didn't in the end). ""and it has been CONTINOUSLY ticking (since we pulled the watch off his arm)"". When Timmy runs around saying how he is protecting bears (in a PROTECTED NATIONAL PARK for that ""flying thing's"" sake!), you know he's had it. There are some pretty sick statements made in that movie, that's for sure. 3 Stars for cute foxes in nice scenery."
3,Great footage ... very sick....no... dead Man,"I have been a wildlife cameraman for over 15 years and filmed on Kodiak. He is in a word. Nuts. By anthropomorphizing bears ,or any other animal, it causes harm to them and any other human that comes it contact with that animal. By attaching human emotion to a bear...by thinking a bear reacts to it's environment like a human is simply incorrect. The only reason this misguided man was able to survive as long as he did is because the bears had a more nutrient-filled food source available to them in the river. And maybe because their is hunting on Kodiak. Which is the one of the reasons Kodiak Grizzlies are so prolific on that island. I hope people don't take anything he says as fact or even as a theory on grizzly behavior. This film was edited to create as much emotion and drama as it could from a pile of aimless raw footage. I will say the fox and bear footage is more than enough to watch this amazing tragic film."
3,should have stayed with photography,"The photography in this movie is some of the best footage of our Alaskan brown bears (grizzlies). Treadwell should have stayed with photography. This is not a movie I would let children watch because of the extremely foul language used during his misguided ramblings. General opinion up here is that he got what he deserved, but took an innocent person and the animals he said he wanted to protect with him. Basically he was an idiot with a really good camera and a talent for shooting bears in their natural habitat, he should have overcome the urge to interfere with those animals and save the lives lost at his ignorance and stupidity."
1,Mentally Ill homeless man commits suicide by bear,"I can't believe this movie won all these awards ! I sat down to watch this movie with my 9 year old son , when we saw the guy caressing bear poop that was enough ! I guess after Michael Moore and Broke Back Mt. I should'nt be surprised Hollywood just gets weirder and weirder !"
1,Seen this plenty of other times.........,"....in the West. It's full of trustfunder's who head out West to become (in their mind) the next Jeremiah Johnson. The West is full of 'em.Unfortunately, they're usually so full of bs, that the only actual facts in their stories is their names."
1,Conservationist? Who? Timothy Treadwell?,"I thought I was going to see some really outstanding grizzly filming. This movie should have been labeled ""One man's descent into insanity"". Timothy Treadwell was a self absorbed,selfish, egocentric man and this story is about him and not the bears. Due to his own behavior he became a dish for one of the bears. Too bad he took someone else along with him to his death. A couple of the bears he ""loved"" so much had to be murdered because of his behavior. I would not recommend this movie."
1,Far from being a documentary,"In my opinion, a documentary is to inform the audience of certain knowledge and in this case it should have been - bears. A wild animal in general will never attack unless it is hungry or if it feels threatened or you are threatening the life of its young. This is how humans act 98% of the time so why is anyone surprise at other animals behaving in the same manner? The fact that Timothy strode around unharmed isn't really anything amazing. I did not think him crazy or irrational but I did feel like I was watching an episode of Captain Kangaroo and as the film progressed, the Captain on drugs. He spoke like a child most of the time and I felt sorry for him. He disconnected so badly from society at a very early age and somehow never matured properly. If you feel like you learned something after watching this film then kudos. Me, I learned nothing."
3,"Interesting, bizarre, disturbing, gruesome...","Definitely one of a kind and thought-provoking, but not as visually stunning as I expected. Some gruesome details made me feel uncomfortable. I did enjoy watching the cute foxes though. If you like documentaries about animals, check out March of the Penguins, Genesis, and the Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill."
3,"Compelling, but Flawed Film","Despite knowing the ""ending"" of the film beforehand, I found it impossible to stop watching it. The footage of the grizzlies and other wildlife is amazing, and Herzog is a wonderful director. However, I think that Andy Dick was horribly miscast in this movie."
2,Please do not feed the bears.,"What is this fascination we have for viewing troubled or mental people as entertainment? I can see Treadwells love for these bears but he never respected them. There is a difference here. While Steve Irwin loves his croc's, we don't see him swimming and trying to cuddle them, for obvious reason. Herzog and his backers saw an opportunity to make some money off some guys personal train wreck and to call this documentary entertainment, educational or even informative is nonsense, unless, of course, you like to see bears in the wild like I do, which explains the two stars. O.K. film except Treadwell kept getting in the way. Besides, humans cannot be good for a bears digestion, in fact, this poor bear died of lead poisoning. Sorry about Amy though. Her decision to stay with that nut case cost her everything she was and would have been. Bad choice."
5,Amazing film of a unique man.,"I just saw this documentary and wow it was amazing. When I first heard of this film I thought it was just some animal nut that got killed by the bears he lived with. But after watching this you feel like you knew Timothy Treadwell, you feel his pain and understand his troubles. It's not so much a movie on bears as it is on a man who escaped into his own world. Before seeing this I had no clue who Timothy Treadwell was, but now I will never forget him."
2,Interesting look into a crazy person's mind,Wow...I can't believe I just watched all that. I am not shocked at all that this guy preferred living alone with bears...he would not function well in society lol. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it kept my attention enough to watch all the way through. That and Grizzly bears are HUGE and scary lol
2,The Wasted Life of a Young and Privledged Boy,"This is all about the afterlife of a good looking, middle class, smart, blond headed Anglo who drug fried his brains during his freshman year in college and subsequently dropped out.His afterlife consisted of being a Beach Bum in Southern California in the winter and tent camping with a girl friend among wild Grizzly Bears of Alaska during the summer.Given that some of the screen sequences he took with his hand held camera are remarkable, his narration of same was limited. In fact if you removed all versions of the ""f"" word from his vocabulary, the Alaskan portion would be improved, but shorten considerably.Don"
2,Glad I didn't buy it.,"We just watched the Grizzly Man and couldn't help but think that Timothy Treadwell was in serious need of mental health and used the grizz and Alaska to escape the truth and reality. As mentioned in the movie, he did more to harm bears with his constant intrusion in there areas. There wasn't one moment in the film were he or the director ever showed him actually helping any wild thing, unless you count the time he sounded as though he was crying at the death of a bee, baby fox, or grizzly cub. Sounded as though he didn't truly understand the life and death in the animal kingdom or was in some type of denial of the real world. I'm glad we watched it but I'd suggest renting it, it's not something I need to watch again. It may make an interesting study for students or professionals dealing with mental health issues."
2,Painful to witness.,"An obviously confused and trouble man, Timothy chronicles his unarmed encounters with the worlds most successful and feared predators. The entire manic journey was painful to watch. His misplaced adoration and disturbing humanization of these beasts leads him to become bolder with every passing year. The most tragic repercussion of his entire life was how he lured a woman he supposedly loved into his unholy lair. Both of them suffered an agonizing and terrifying death by these sweet little ""friends"" of his who only tolerated his presence because they had something easier to eat. I mourn his girlfriends' passing, and I chalk up to his death to him loving the creature more than the Creator. Don't watch unless you want real-life induced nightmares."
3,Don't Feed the Bears,"Grizzly Man is a decent movie, although not quite the 5 star film it was made out to be. It's definitely an interesting portrait of an insane man who replaced his drinking addiction with a bear addiction. However, the director creates many forced moments, like when the Grizzly Man's sorta ex-girlfriend is given his watch straight out of an evidence bag. You can just picture the director behind the camera motioning for more tears. He also adds a lot of unecessary commentary and opinions, where the footage itself should be telling the story. ""I believe the universe is chaos."" Okay, thanks Nietzsche, now let's get back to the crazy guy touching the bear poo.Also, the movie should be called Fox Man, since the foxes seemed to have liked him, while the bears obviously didn't."
2,Lot of the Same,"I felt that the movie kept repeating itself over and over. Scene after scene, Treadwell is shown talking to the bears, spouting his love for nature, and going on ranting tirades against the government, poachers, and society at large. I would have liked to see a more linier approach taken to the film with more explanation as to why he chose to live with the bears, and how his unique method of study evolved. What exactly did Treadwell do in respect to his non-profit? We are told that he goes around to schools at no charge giving presentations, but what impact did this have? How did the educators who invited him to speak at their schools view him? I would also have liked to hear from the Forest service (or at least been told that they had been contacted for comment). In all, this film was quite redundant with no real climax or ""gee wiz moment."""
3,MUST SEE!!,This film is truly something special. It is a remarkable study on the passion between a man and the things that he loved the most - grizzly bears and the wilds of nature. This film will stay with you long after you have viewed it. Truly unforgetable.
4,Can you say l-i-t-h-i-u-m?,"The real star of ""Grizzly Man"" is not Timothy Treadwell or even the bears. It's the medical examiner--a man who took way too much pleasure in describing partially-digested body parts. Nice to see someone so obviously enjoying his job.This is a great movie that just begs to be discussed, analyzed, mulled over. I differ from many reviewers who are hellbent on romanticizing or making poetic Timothy Treadwell's life. Or death-by-bear-attack, as the case may be. I saw Mr. Treadwell as a poster child for untreated mental illness. His death, while probably predictable, was all the more tragic because his ""friends"" were caught up in mythologizing a young man who was in dire need of mental health intervention, evaluation and treatment. Narcissism was the least of his problems.""Grizzly Man"" should inspire all of us to be better, more attentive friends to each other."
4,Grizzley Man,"This movie is a serious reminder that bears are wild animals. Although Mr. Treadwell's intentions seemed honorable, he lost touch with the reality of nature. This is a must see for anyone going into bear country."
3,Witnessing Mental Illness,"Bears and maulings aside,this is a diary of mental illness.It's interesting and sad at the same time.I wonder if at anytime he recieved some kind of professional help?Someone needs to send a copy to Tom Cruise,this guy needed meds not fresh carrot sticks and a jog!"
3,Odd and Interesting Doc,"This was definitely an odd documentary. When I had finished watching the movie, I looked back and wondered how I had made it through the whole movie. Doc shows just how crazy you can go when living in isolation for so long. Got to hand it to the Timothy though, he was deeply passionate about something, and that is more than most of us can say. It may not be the best movie you ever watch but it's worth watching. The footage of the bears is amazing."
2,Compelling and Weird,My wife and I watched this documentary on the Dicovery Channel last night. Treadwell was mentally ill. He needed help. It was funny at some points without intending to be. The footage was beautiful and I liked the narrator. Treadwell's friends seemed to be just as misguided as he was. I think they live in a world of idealism that doesn't translate to real life. The native Alaskans had it right. Respect and keep your distance from the grizzly.
4,Haunting,"Treadwell was obviously on a mission to self-destruct. There is not doubt Treadwell was a disturbed person, on many levels. His romanticized approach to the bears is a wonderful comment on how far the human race can stray from reality while totally disrespecting Nature. As a study in the psychologically disturbed mind of one man, the film is wonderful. I don't think the film was ever meant to be a study of the Grizzly. Therefore, it succeeded. I found the film to be one of a haunting quality. It stays with me."
1,He murdered his girlfriend!,"If this waste of film was released without him getting killed and murdering his hostage girlfriend, then reviewers would all be saying the same thing: this loser was a stupid mental case! But since he got himself killed, people feel bad-*sniff- so they write about how heartfelt he was in his mission. Please! Um, what exactly did he do to save the bears? If a homeless man loves the ocean, lives on a beach, and constantly says he loves the fish and dead animals washed up on the beach, would you say how spirited and wonderful he is? Where's my video camera? I'm going to quit my job, because nature- here I come!"
1,UN-BEAR-ABLE,"I agree with the guy in this film that said, the only reason this idiot survived so long is the bears thought he was mentally ill. Naming all the bears also sickened me. The fact that he wanted them to feel safe with humans is the ultimate hypocrisy.How are you protecting bears, making them comfortable with human beings that want, for the most part to do them harm. I feel he got what he deserved, & I'm happy he's no longer in their world. I care more about animals & nature, than I do about people. Never the less, it's mindblowing to see this guy acting like such a crazy idiot!"
1,Movie stinks,Movie has very little about bears but is about some wacko who only knows how to converse in four letter words. A big disappointment. Threw the movie in the garbage.
2,The Fool on the Hill,"Hmmmmm. Well, Treadwell's as easy a target for armchair critics (i.e., me) as he obviously was for the bear that finally had enough of his antics and decided to go all Darwin on him (although how it managed to choke down that enormous ego we'll never know). This all makes perfect sense, of course -- bears will be bears and all -- but I can't shake the feeling that the guy never imaged such a thing could happen. In the end, this film is more a study in human vanity (make no mistake: Treadwell's the star of this show, the bears merely bit players) than natural beauty, and that's the real tragedy here. I was disturbed by this film, but not for the reasons I expected...."
2,Curious?,"It would have been nice if they shared the recorded audio of the incident. I would give this doc perfect marks if they had not mentioned that the audio on the video camera was still rolling at the time of the attack. Why bring it up if they were not going to play it. They had no problem showing the gross image of the gutted bear that ate the victims. The audio would have been less gory then the image. I was overwhelmingly curious to hear it since they made it known. Even if it was terrifying to listen to I still would listen to it. It pissed me off because now that curiosity will never be satisfied. I'm not sure what I would get out of listening to it, I just know I hate when people only give you part of a story. The most curious part about this doc was the audio and it's the one thing they left out."
1,Documentary of an egotistical fool,"I watched this entire movie, trying at every turn to understand the worth or message of this documentary. My only achievement was having stayed awake, given the bad narration, and the cheap acting attempts made by Treadwell's friends. The movie may have been more interesting and worthy of the DVD rental fee had the movie depicted a person who really understood grizzlies, and who emulated some sense of normalcy in dealing with nature's hazzards. Instead, I saw an arrogant, self-absorbed, irritating fool repeatedly telling all animals ""I love you, I love you"", and who frequently pontificated his greatness among the wilderness. Treadwell, I believe, had serious emotional issues, a factor that probably got him and his girlfriend killed, or may have been smoking some Alaskan weed that has not yet made it to the rest of America."
4,EXTRAORDINARY -- MESMERIZING AND SAD,"What could've been sensational and exploitive given the subject matter (and highly ironic title), Werner Herzog's GRIZZLY MAN is instead a mesmerizing, perceptive and heart-rending account of Timothy Treadwell and girl friend Amie Huguenard's fateful attempt to live with and film Alaska's endangered, wild bears.Their remains were found at Katmai Reserve in October 2003. They had been eaten by the animals they loved.Culled from over a hundred hours of Treadwell's expert footage, Herzog fashioned a paradoxical portrait of a troubled, compassionate man seeking solace and understanding.Was Treadwell a nave naturalist who lost touch with reality and died as a result? Or was he an outcast who found peace for his feral soul in the wild and dangerous place he finally felt most at home?"
4,best price i can find for these blades,We buy these for our production shop 5 at a time.They wear nicely and the guys love them.great price too
3,Sensitive to hair dye,"I've tried other products like l'oreal that I have encountered bad reactions to - itchiness, redness, swelling and severe dry patches of skin that lasts for 2wks+. Decided to give this product a try after doing lengthy online research. Difficulty is that for dark haired dyes to work, you need some % of ppd hence the reactions. All you can do is control the lvl of ppd you are exposing yourself to. While this product has the minimal amount of ppd, I did exhibit a bit of itching and slight swelling. It's definitely an improvement vs. l'oreal but there is still reaction if you are sensitive to ppd. If anyone can recommend another permanent dye w/no reaction, please do!"
4,At least a dye that does not hurt your hair--or scalp...,"Since my gray hair started showing up early, I have been dying my hair for decades. The result was not only dry, dull hair, but loss of it, as well. However, at long last, here is a hair dye that is not harmful to hair and actually leaves it softer and shinier--in other words, healthier. Tints of Nature does not damage my hair, nor does it sting my scalp as professional and over-the-counter dyes have done in the past. Since it gradually washes out, I don't have to deal with the stark contrast of gray roots against the darker color of the rest of my hair. It is a great product, the shampoo that comes with it is wonderful, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that because it is a gentler, kinder way to color hair, I have to use it every 3 weeks or so. However, I would rather dye my hair with Tints of Nature than suffer the damage to my hair of a harsher, more permanent dye."
5,Happy with Hair,My hairdresser had been using an organic hair line on me for over a year. I liked the idea that I wasn't using harmful chemicals to color treat my hair as i had to have it done monthly. I couldn't keep my appointment one time and decided to look up natural haircolor on line and found this product. It has almost the exact ingredients as the organic line my profesional uses. I just ordered 4 more boxes and will have them on hand. This allows me to color at my convenience knowing my hair will be healthy. Love this product!
5,good product for chemical sensitivities,This is the only permanent hair color that does not cause me to develop systemic hives. I take it to my hairdresser instead of using any of their products.
5,Earth & Body Friendly,A truly great products. My hair and scalp look and feel great since I have been using NatureTints.No more chemicals for me. I get compliments on my hair all the time. And thank you Amazonfor helping me source this product - it is challenging to locate.
2,Gray coverage is poor,"I like this color because it most closely resembles my natural color of all the ones I've tried. However, the gray coverage is poor. I do not have a lot of gray--maybe 2-3 percent. So I will probably go back to Nature Tint."
3,Looks great; color doesn't last very long,"I love the color of this product; plus it left my hair texture as normal as my own hair, which is great since I was concerned it would damage my hair like other hair color products. The only problem is the color only lasted three weeks -- and I use color-safe shampoo and only wash every other day. So, that's very disappointing....Otherwise great product!"
3,Fun toy but no longer works,"I bought this toy about 2 years ago for my infant son to play with in the tub. A few months after playing with it, the toy no longer wound up; we have well water, so either some sediment or mineral deposits could have formed on the gears. That was disappointing, but the toy is still played with two years later by both my son and daughter even if it doesn't move on its own."
4,Dragon's Blood,"To read the first book ""Dragon's Blood"" it took me about a month. What I liked about this book was that it was a dream like adventure. It was really interesting. I would recommend this to others even older or around my age (9) beacause it was a great book. I'm really looking forward to reading the next book ""The Prisoner""."
4,Uniquely adventuresome,"This book explores a seemingly mundane cave through the eyes of the children who discover it, offering unique perspectives of both the kids and even some of the intelligent creatures they meet along the way. Each of them grows into their strengths as people, facing their fears along the way, and discovers there is much more to this cave than meets the eye..."
5,"Oh my gosh, what a wonderful story.","Although set in simpler times, the characters you initially meet are adventurous and rich with tribal and family values. As the story progresses, the characters to which you are introduced have individual character, but not all can be trusted.The story starts off a little slowly, setting the atmosphere and character development, but as the adventure begins the story quickly unfolds and the challenges that our adventurers face are many. They need to rely on their whit, cunning, and courage to take on characters with vast unyielding powers.The conclusion of the story leaves you grasping for more. I have book two on order and can not wait for it to arrive. It is my opinion that this book is a must read for the young and old alike."
1,review,"Most importantly, the device renders highly variable readings if i take the readings repeatedly at one time. This issue renders the product unsuitable. The device senses when the reading is complete and beeps so this cannot be controlled by the user. The measurements in one spot can deviate by up to 10MM!!!In addition, the directions are quite poorly written, even though i read the instructions many times. The controls on the device are also not intuitive, resulting in having to read the manual to operate the device. This is time consuming. I have a graduate degree so i think i know good writing from bad writing."
1,real (ain't the )one,"wonderful player with great features BUT it only works with real one software. I could not get the real one program to recognize the panasonic player. Panasonic tech support was zero help- the ""tech"" who answered the phone barely recognized the name of the player.they could not help so I had to wait 3 days for a technician (?) to call- they had no help. After attempting again with tech support I gave up and returned the unit. why don't they support other software like musicmatch? ""Brent's rule"": if a piece of computer equipment can't be made to work in 1 hour- return it."
3,Not thrilled with their tone...,"I've tried these now on 6 different violins, and I have to say I don't like their tone on any of them. They're warm, yes, but they lack a good depth in terms of colour on the sound. Also, they tend to sound... almost buzzy. It's hard to explain just what I mean by that, but it's a weird sort of tone I don't like. They ARE, however, very even in tone. Smooth and mellow. The response is a little slower than Obligatos, and the tone isn't as complex, but they're generally less expensive, and they're designed to mix and match with the Infeld Blues (which I've not tried).This isn't to say they're bad strings, and strings will sound different on different violins, but I've yet to find a violin these sound good on."
1,yuck,My husband loves these strings but I hate them. They don't sound any darker to me infact I feel like I am being whined at whenever I play and it drives me crazy. I play during my alone time for relaxation while my son is at preschool but since getting the new strings I find myself avoiding the violin. When I do play I don't feel like I have had any alone time at all because of the annoying sound it produces.
4,The Perfect Introduction,"There is no world-famous footage here, no lightning-flash illumination of animal behavior that we haven't seen in other tapes, and yet... it's so beautifully filmed and so many popular species are covered as they go through birth, mating and death that this tape should be brought as an introduction before others that might have classic footage but are more narrow in scope. If you have only one African wildlife video, this should probably be it. Look for the lion who's just lost the girl to his buddy - and is so put out that he ignores another lioness who saunters up and swats him across the face, as if she's saying ""hey, stupid!"" As with many other wildlife tapes, you may want to review this one before letting the younger kids watch."
1,A Gunfight (VHS Tape),Good off-beat western; however the vhs tape I received was an extremely poor LP transfer. It was necessary to play the tape at the maximum volume level and even then alot of dialogue was inaudible. Wish I had tried dvd purchase instead.
3,Fair Review,The movie was a great movie. The color of themovie was fair quality. The colors were not bright.If it would have come on dvd I would have bought thedvd and hoped the color would be better.
4,A quick dose of good thinking.,"I thought this book was terrific. The author has a great philosophy of life, and shares it an easy increments. It works on many levels, and I've found it a great one to look at each evening. I enjoyed it very much."
5,What a pleasant surprise,"First let me say that I am NOT a big fan of this type of music, not very knowledgeable in the Klezmer world, and have to admit I was drawn in by the punny title. Now am so glad I was. Most of the music is BIG FUN. Zips along and makes you tap your feet. Then there are the slow songs that can bring you to tears. The singer has the voice of an angel, a full bodied angel, but an angel nonetheless. I love the intricate weavings of the instruments, love the feelings that sweep over me when I listen to this CD again and again. I will search out more music by this group and try and find out where I can see them live."
4,Good general book.....,"This book is great for a beginner looking for techniques and tips on masonry and mortar. The stonework section is ok, the brick and block laying sections are much better. B & W photos throughout the book, but still a good reference."
3,For slow and casual walkers.,"On the cover of the packaging for this item is a skateboarding kid attempting a 360 aerial maneuver. Good thing he doesn't have this cassette player clipped to his cut-offs and the headphones strapped to his head, or the outcome would be seriously in doubt. But since there's no built-in speaker with the unit, the only possible use I can see for it is to motivate aerobic activity--jogging if not skateboarding. Problem is, it's fairly bulky and is closer to a full than the advertised half pound.I got the item on a Friday Sale, so the cost of returning it would be close to my original outlay. I'll probably just keep it and use it for walking the cat. Or when I get time, I'll sell it on the internet at cost so someone gets some use out of it. And to be fair to the Casio people, who generally offer a lot of product (in this case, too much) for the money, I see that their model has smaller dimensions than comparable machines from Phillips and Panasonic."
4,An excellent advanced course or self-teaching text,"This is possibly the clearest textbook exposition of the fundamentals of nonlinear mechanics that I have seen. The various finite deformation tensors are developed thoroughly but from initially simple systems in a manner that should be accessible to senior students. These fundamentals are then applied to the increasingly-important class of hyperelastic materials, a fairly recent development in many FE codes but with applications ranging from vehicle tyres, to running shoes to biomedical implants.Unlike many texts, this book does not attempt to address the whole field of continuum mechanics and, in particular, does not really consider inelasticity or fluids. This helps keep the cost down to a level that students might afford.An alternative might be Mase's 'Continuum Mechanics' (Shaum's Outline Series), which does not however include the finite element aspects."
5,Does a good job with the fundamentals,"This book does well with the principles of finite deformation. From its first few chapters which enter into the preliminaries of finite deformation to its final chapters which transform the theory of finite deformation into a workable finite element code. If you are interested in going from the theory to the finite element code, this book is for you. The book uses a finite deformation (hyperelastic and isotropic) finite element code to teach you all of the subroutines required. The book references a website where you can download the source code. The only major weakness of the book is the fact that the book ultimately assumes an isotropic material to carry the theory forward."
1,All you reviewers are BLIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNND!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, some say this is not the best recording of JCS, But this is atrocious mainly because of one man. CLIVE (fu*king) ROWE!!!!!!! He is the worst singer, let alone Judas I have ever heard. He wouldn't have been good enough for EPAC, and they are a community theater. Okay first of all, the man has no sense of rhythm and no style. If I had to sum his singing up in one word it would be... ""butchering""; for that is what he does to every piece on this soundtrack. Here's some advice: if anyone offers this cd for free... RUN!!!!"
1,"Good God III (Pardon the pun, a third time)...","This review was used for the full recording, and can be applied absolutely to the highlights, errr... low lights...You know, 1995 was a bad bad year for this musical. All of the recordings I have heard form this year are bad, rotten, junk, garbage, etc... This is no exception. Judas needs have passion and range, and this Judas has wailing and a tons of missed high notes. What confuses me is how do these studio albums make it out of the studio. One of these musicians or technicians has to have perfect pitch, heck, normal pitch; and anyone listening to this in the first minute is going to realize that this studio recording missed wide. Not to mention the stylings of Rowe are abysmal.Ugggg... again...."
5,fascinating history,This book brings to life the family history of Nathan fish and his many descendants through meticulously sought out historical documents. The family photos and detective work put into this book make it a truly fascinating read.
3,Buy My Very First Mother Goose instead,"Going strictly on my three preschoolers' (ages 5, 3, and 1)preferences, we honestly can't recommend Here Comes Mother Goose. We have spent countless hours reading/singing (and taping and repairing) Opie/Wells' first book, My Very First Mother Goose. But Here Comes M.G. just doesn't resonate with my children in the same way. If you're trying to decide between the two, we whole-heartedly recommend My Very First Mother Goose - a much-loved favorite!"
5,An accessible and refreshing Mother Goose for all ages!,"I loved Here Comes Mother Goose. My 11 year old daughter loved it too. Rosemary Wells is so clever, mixing up the what little boys and what little girls are made up was wonderful! The art and characters are what make this book standout for us. The ryhme selection also is great - the rhymes with violence have been skipped, nice for a change. We have both collections now and have given many as gifts."
2,Sanitized Pablum,"Why did she shorten a number of the poems/ditties? This reads like my radio scanning the first 10 seconds of each station. These poems were written with lots of verses, why not include them?And I don't particularly enjoy the sanitizing of the What Are Little Boys Made Of poem. Why not read it in the original? Wouldn't it provide an interesting opportunity to discuss gender stereotypes to appropriately aged children, instead of dumbing it down for them?I did like My Kindergarten, though."
3,disapointing,"This has a fairly nice selection of rhymes, and the pictures are bright, but the pictures seem rather unrelated to the rhymes -and for a child just learning to speak it seems important thatthe pictures and the rhymes match. I was given a copy but I donot read it to my 2-year-old. I much prefer the Orchard Book ofNursery Rhymes which i found at the local library. (Why three stars and not fewer? Because I saw at the library many nursery rhyme books that were worse.)"
1,politically correct garbage,"The switching of ""What little girls/little boys are made of"" is asinine. While I am not a proponent of burning books, I might as well have burned the money I spent on this one. How disappointing. I recognize that the argument to keep politics out of nursery rhymes has been disputed ad nauseum, but that's really the point isn't it? If you, like me, prefer that your kids learn the rhymes the same way they've been passed down, then avoid this book. That one change has rendered all else suspect. However, if you are down with feminism rah rah, here's the book for you. But why not call it, ""Here comes Androgynous Goose."" After all, the image of a maternal fowl spouting gibberish promotes a terrible stereotype. One that the author might well wish to avoid. In fine, this book lays a big fat egg. Thanks. You've been great. Don't forget to tip the bartender."
4,"Not a spy book, but a book about spies.","If you buy this book expecting spy stories,you're going to be disappointed. But it will bevery interesting to those who follow the spygenre. It begins with stories about AmericanRevolution spying and ends in the early 60's withCIA tales. There are many names dropped, andthis may be the main value to some. It'sinteresting to read who has done intelligencework -- a Who's Who of the Who's Who.The book metemorphoses from a rather dry historicaltreatise at the beginning through other phases toa CIA-centered story at the end, no doubt becauseMr. O'Toole was himself in the CIA. Lots of thingshere that you won't find collected elsewhere;well researched and well documented."
2,"The shoes were not what I had hoped,",So I returned tham and am waiting for a refund on my bank card statement.
5,"Wonderful arrangements, wonderful listening.","Juanita Newland-Ulloa's Mariposa is a wonderful arrangement of seventeen Latin America Lullabies and melodic songs that will be deeply enjoyed by all ages of listeners, but mostly for the very little ones."
5,Like bedtime with my Dad,"I was given this book by a dear friend for my 50th birthday. Imagine my surprise when it turned out Jackie was reading Caroline a lot of the same poems that my Dad used to read to my sister and me at bedtime. I lost this book, along with many others, in the flood following Katrina. There are books that I decided I could live without, but this one I had to replace."
2,I was a little disappointed,"I bought this vehicle for my grandsons and had it shipped directly to them. If I had seen it before they did I probably would not have given it to them. My daughter has since taken it away from them. One button that you press starts blinking lights, which are great, the children really like them. Press another button and a VERY loud male voice says something like ""Get out of the car"" There is no way that my daughter could find that can disconnect that voice. Not only is it too loud but it doesn't make a young child think policemen are very nice. Also,the back wheels have no traction so the car needs to be pushed along."
1,not worth the money,i bought this police car for my 2yr old son. it came with a policeman that does not fit in the car and this frustrated my son. the mans voice in the car is so loud and scary and one of the doors fell off one week after i bought it. i would not spend the money on this car.
2,Disappointed in Tonka,"I spent the extra money on the Tonka name and was ver disappointed with the quality. The door doesn't open wide enough and if pushed, it breaks. The buttons worked for about 3 days and my son had hardly played with it. The action figure that my son was very excited to get with the car did not fit. Overall, I wished I'd would have purchased the MUCH cheaper option."
3,good but...,"this is one of the best macfarlane's dragons i have seen, but it took a hell lot of efford to pit on the wings... I had to push so hard that my hands turned red.. I had this problem with a lot of macfarlane's figurines..."
3,mini skirts review,"This is another book I read last year.It was ok and showed a lot of opinion I thought.It was written well.I didn't agree with everything in there I believe was the impression I'd gotten from the book.The subject matter is,of course,of great interest to me because of my own experiences into Islam(and out).Nadia N.Rehmani-author of Sharper Than A Two Edged Sword-A True Story Of One Woman's Walk Into Islam And Out."
3,Nice BUT,"I purchased the Melissa and Doug Deluxe Wooden High Chair and love it BUT it took me 2 phone calls to Melissa & Doug to get replacement parts. The tray for the high chair was warped; there was a big chip in one of the side pieces, the back of the chair had a split in it and a part of the seat broke loose. Melissa & Doug are very cooperative and do send out replacement parts but do not order this chair if you don't have the time and patience to wait it out."
5,Love Melissa and Doug products!,"I have purchased several Melissa and Doug products for my grandchildren and have always been very pleased. This doll high chair is no exception! I wanted a wooden high chair for my 2 year old granddaughter to play with with her ""babies"" and this high chair is perfect! It was very easy to assemble and is extremely sturdy. This high chair is one that will last well past her doll playing days."
2,"Junk,, Avoid !!","It looks nice enough and assembly is easy however as I was twisting last screw into back of chair,a very simple process it actually split entire wood below seat allowing leg spindle now to fall right out,wood is now cracked in half showing screw and leg wont stay in place. So now I have leg out and screw showing and half of wood is out..So do i return it or keep it broken like this( it will surely not last long with inadequate support)?? Such an aggravation.The problem clearly is that the screws are far too large for the wood it is threading into.A design flaw no doubt.I would venture to say that wood doesnt always break when screwing in ( my other screws went in) but they cut corners on wooden frame at exactly the wrong points so they likelyhood of this happening is very possible.More crap designs by yet another company... My daughter is inside now playing with leg that keeps falling out..Real nice ,not !"
5,great doll high chair!,"I bought this doll high chair for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for christmas. She plays with it all the time. I like it because it is sturdy, the right size for a small child to play with, and it's cute!"
2,M&D Wooden Doll High Chair,Seems to be a nice toy BUT the left arm already started cracking and my daughter does not take the tray off. I did contact Melissa and Doug so I will update what the results are - hopefully they will be satisfactory.
3,Disappointed in Melissa and Doug,"I bought this high chair for my two-year-old and I must say that she absolutely LOVES playing with it! We own MANY Melissa and Doug products so I knew that I couldn't go wrong with this item. However, two of the slots where the screws attach were either stripped or not drilled correctly. The screws would not go in and they are in key places to keep the legs strong. My daughter does climb on it and/or sit in it. I did read (on amazon) that others were having this problem but decided to take a chance anyway. My mistake. We have made do and modified some ourselves to keep the product safe, but I was very disappointed. We did not feel like going through the process of sending it back and waiting for a new one. I don't think we could have gotten it out of her sight long enough to do so! Anyway, it is an adorable item and I will continue to buy M & D products. I'll just be more diligent in sending things back if needed."
4,Perfect doll highchair for 3 year old,"Looked around for a good doll high chair and this one is perfect! Good value, well built, very easy to put together and so far holding up well with regular play. Glad I read all the positive reviews! It's a little smaller than I anticipated, but that's actually a plus as it fits my 3 year old daughter perfectly and doesn't take up too much space! All dolls we own fit well. The Melissa and Doug feeding set is a nice addition too. My little one loves feeding her babies in her new highchair!"
1,Dont't buy this book if...,"If you want to learn what Aspect Programming is, don't buy this book. If you want to know how to use Aspect Programming, don't buy this book. If you want to know what Aspect Programming is for, don't buy this book. This is a collection of ehem... ""high level, systemic"" articles, usually not top quality about... yes, good question, about what?... Buying this book was total waste of monies, several attempts to read was total waste of time. No, this book was not too difficult for me; I am computer engineering professor"
5,Just what i needed,Tidying up the office and needed this to store master documents and it works great! Stands up even when full!
1,"""Hated It""","Suspense? Yes, but charactures poorly developed. Bad writing; cornie plot. It was a tourchure finishing it. I will not read another Keith Lee Johnson book."
1,What happened Keith???,"I first heard of Keith Lee Johnson from reading another of his novels ""Pretenses"" What a great book. Which is why I decided to pick this one up. What happened Keith??? This book was very poorly written and seemed almost rushed, like he had a deadline to meet and was trying to meet it quick and in a hurry. It was very boring and just didn't make a lot of sense to me. If i hadn't read Pretenses and loved it so much, I would say this was the last book I planned to read by this author, but i'll give him another shot, two more to be exact since i just purchased Fate's Redemption and little black girl lost. I hope he comes thru in these two books."
5,Twists and Turns that will keep you turning the page,"SUGAR & SPICE by Keith Lee Johnson is a must have if you love a good suspense novel. It is full of several twists and turns and you will not be able to put the book down.Normally, the reader is trying to figure out who the killer is along with the detective. However in this case, we already know the twins are doing the killing. The fun part is traveling along with Detective Phoenix Perry as she gets closer and closer to finding out who could commit some of the horrendous murders that span from one coast to the other.Just when you thought you knew more than Detective Perry, the author threw in some more twists that will have you shaking your head and asking yourself-how could I have missed that?Overall, this is a good read and I would highly recommend it. I don't want to give away too many details about the book-don't want to spoil the suspense. After reading SUGAR & SPICE, I look forward to many more books in this genre from Keith Lee Johnson."
4,Thriller 360,"I have read all of Keith Lee Johnson's novels and he has not failed us. Sugar and Spice is a thriller that keeps you wondering and ultimately guessing from the first page to the last page.A set of twins have just gotten released from prison and they are on the rampage. No one knows who, why, when and where. When you think that you know your next victim the twins shake it up and have you rereading other pages to see if you have missed something.Though it might not bring you the excitement of Little Black Girl Lost, the knowledge of Fate's Redemption of the action of Pretenses it definitely delivers the thriller that we are looking for."
5,WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!,"Keith Lee Johnson has mastered the art of pulling a reader into the pages and taking them through twist and turns, page after page. The short chapters add to his craftiness. Ladies!!!Put the pilates down, this book will have your heart really pumpin'. This book is a Book Club must. I'm looking forward to his next book ""Pretenses""."
3,let down,"because of the recommendations i received for this lbook, i expected alot better reading. the book had alot of killing with no real purpose. it was not a mystery suspense. it was just killing with little plot. i am learly of buying this author again."
5,Great Read,I've never been into mysteries but this novel has sparked a new interest! Keep up the good work!
5,Sugar and Spice,Excellent a must read from beginning to end. Each page left u wanting to know what happened next.
5,Addictive,"There is only one thing to say. Absolutely FANTASTIC book. Got to work at 3:30am - finished it at 8am. Read PRETENSES yesterday equally as good. Could not put either books down. Once you start you just want to finish.Make sure to read Pretenses first if you have both books. You don't have to read both, but it's so much better if you do."
5,A wonderful read,"Sugar and Spice by Keith Lee Johnson was an excellant read. The twists and turns were enough to keep me glued to the sofa reading the book until the very end...in one sitting! It's a welcome relief to alot of the books out there, engaging the reader in a whodunit that you wouldn't believe. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."
4,Spicy!,"Sugar and Spice was a Thriller with many twists and turns, just when you think you have it figured out, you realize that you were wrong. I was surprised by the ending, this was a very quick read for me.I cannot wait until the next book Pretenses come out!!"
3,cool collector item,It's a great football but looks nothing like the picture. But all and all I'm happy to have a pretty cool falcons football
2,You can better performances elsewhere,"I was disappointed with this CD. With the songs listed, I thought this might be a good compilation disc. Unfortunately I have heard better performances on other CD's of the songs listed. A better CD to get would be another one put out on the Showstoppers label: After Hours on Broadway (M-2-0721). That one is much more enjoyable to listen to."
3,I LOVE HANK BALLARD,I am a collector of HANK BALLARD because I LOVE JAMES BROWN and HE LOVES HANK BALLARD. It's part of the origin of SOUL and R&B. HE deserves recognition for HIS early contributions. This purchase was part of my collection.
2,Don't buy this camera!,"It only takes a 1 minute stall for the camera to shut itself off. It saves the battery, but a HUGE pain in the butt when you are positioning what you want to shoot and it shuts itself off continuously. The flash is WAY too bright. Every person I take a picture of is ghost white. There are settings for movie and auto, but no setting for portrait, night landscape, etc."
3,Transformation,"This is the third book in the Wter Trilogy series. In this book, Nia and corwin set out to once and for all defeat Ma'el and save Atlantis. I liked most to the book, it was very exciting. The one thing I absolutely hated was the ending, It stunk. But other than that, it was really good."
1,TOTALY DIFFERENT THEN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER READ BEFORE,"I have read this trilogy three times now, and every single time is as good as the next. I love the back covers, they are soo cheesey in how they discripe the story, espesialy if you say them in an anouncer voice. Anyways, this book is my favorate of the tree and if you love fantacy thats just a little different, you will LOOOVVVVEEEEEE this book as much as i do.Recamendations:The Unicorn ChroniclesWater books 1 and 2Song of the wandererEragonHarry Potterthe Two Princesses of BamarreThe SightBuffy (tv show)"
3,Why did it have to end like that?,"Why did Kara decide to end the book(s) the way she did? i didnt' really like the ending though i thought the beginning of the book was pretty good. one of the sad parts is when Callimar betrays Nia for Ma'el! i REALLY didn't like that. i also kinda liked the ending. but.... i don't know. it's just to sad. and it feels like it stopped short for some reason. i don't know why, but it feels that way. :("
2,Are You Masochistic?,"It's a shame that an author capable of such hilarious and wry prose -- ""it would be pretty stupid to get lynched purely because you were trying to avoid getting robbed"" -- has wasted his talents on the trite tales of such an unlikeable bunch. I cringed through the entire book and finished feeling that neither I nor Dave the Traveller had learned anything from his trip to India."
4,Dave's Enlightenment,"I read this book whilst travelling through India, a country which will shock you and yet draw you into the chaos, if you do it right. This book reflected in a completely sarcastic way the exact events and enlightenment that I experienced, Dave the traveller went to India unprepared and came out a changed individual and at 21 so did I. Sutcliffe deserves credit for a novel that often made me understand what was going on around me in a funny and intensely sarcastic manner, if you haven't been to India as a backpacker, you just won't get it..."
4,Funny and touching,"This book is a coming of age story. The story's main character, Dave, decides to go traveling in India. Before the trip, Dave and his friend's girlfriend, Liz, have started to fool around and the only reason Dave goes to India is so that this arrangement can continue. As always in these kinds of books, Dave learns a lot about himself during this journey. Sutcliffe does a great job in describing the sights and sounds of India and also writes a great comic sequence in which Dave and an Indian from Britain, Ranj, go around with a stolen credit card and impress girls so that they can get laid. A great book to read if you want to relax."
5,One of the funniest books ever,I laughed out loud almost all the way through this book. Absolutely brilliant.
5,catharsis delayed,"Having returned from basically the same Indian scene 25 years ago and never having fully recovered, this book was an emetic beyond its own description of one (mild dysentery). Though I've returned to India many times, my first experience was exactly as Sutcliffe describes. The insular, flaming arrogance of the privileged kids that come and go, learning nothing but from each other, is apparently a part of the Indian economy and may one day even become a sect unto itself. Holy it is to wrap yourself in brightly colored rags, hari om, and live for nothing, hari om, till the next check clears, hari om. A culture rich in music that defies description, in exalting dance, they will never know, but only return to the West deserving their memories of the canned, tinny Hindi pop that's blasted in the markets, and the vulgar billboards that advertise an addiction to cliches. How many more bored dilettantes will it take to convince India of its shallowness and two-dimensionality?"
4,An excellent read for the travelled and the not travelled!,This book is absolutely brilliant. Dave is such an amusing character and always totally humiliates himself. The sarcasm Sutcliffe uses is very witty and will guarantee to make you laugh out loud. WARNING: Once you've picked this book up you WON'T put it down.
3,Sad Post Colonial angst,"This book is a good example of why the Brits ""Lost"" the empire. The author is obviously a fan of the Indian writer Upamanyu Chatterjee (English August). The humour and description seems entirely derivative. However he is almost at par occasionally with that other Scottish ""lover"" of India William Dalyrmple...who knows, perhaps they are the same person or seperated at birth. I will make sure I ONLY speak in Hindi to backpackers in India from now on."
3,"Great start, then sort of fizzles","This work comes charging out of the gates: the first of the three sections is hilarious and right on target. If you've done a bit of traveling, you will recognize these characters that Sutcliff paints with such economy and wicked accuracy. At some point in the middle of the novel, however, everything loses focus: I have a feeling that the author changed his mind as to who the narrator was and what he was going to take from his experiences. Thus adrift, the novel finally closes down with a whimper. Nonetheless, a very quick, very light read and at a good price: check it out if you've traveled. For those who've not (remember, ""it's not compulsory""), borrow it (no need to buy)."
2,Really unfunny!!!,"Review:You like to read unfunny books? Then take it!!The novel "" Are you experienced "" starts very well, but then it becomes more and more lengthy, so that I have lost the interest in reading on.Although the novel is written from a first person narrator, I could not identify with or even understand the protagonist's behaviour. Sutcliff's style doesn't convince me, I have not found any parts in the book where tension arises either.In spite of this the story (two young people travel to India for three months during their gap year, because he wants to get her into bed and she wants to find herself there) is good, it's just not put well into practise.Nevertheless I'm proud having read it, because as Dave, the protagonist, says having done it is more fun than the doing it!Since I had to read this novel for school, I have found out many interesting details and so I can say that there is definitely more in the text than I thought before. But I would still not recommend it to a friend!"
4,Good for girls cloths,"This book is good, the only thing missing is the male fashons. All of the cloths are women's, even though some could be altered to be men's cloths. There is a small section about drawing men in women's cloths, but that's it."
4,Little worn,"It was probably used once or twice it looks like, just some creasing at the head of the spine and some weird sticky substance on the spine, like tape or something was ripped off and some remainder stayed. All this is on the paper cover, the actual book is in great condtion. No discoloration, no creasing in the pages and no tears. It's great. Thank you for fast delivery. :)"
5,An excellent resourse.,"This book is a great referance and resource book. It covers almost any type of shirt, pants, hat, scarf, collar, cuff, etc.Anything that you can imagine has a referance in this book.The catagories are all laid out well and everything is easy to find, if you know what you are needing to create a costume. Even if you don't know what you need or want, just thumbing through the book can give you a lot of ideas.It is a good book for artists, not just manga artists.Definately on the ""Must Have"" list."
3,Great for womens reference- but not men,"This book was exacly what I was looking for as a clothing reference except for one thing- WHERE IS THE MEN's CLOTHING. I am so tired of the ""How to Draw Manga"" series focusing mostly on women. News flash- good manga features both men and women. Hopefully volume two will give some coverage- but I doubt it."
3,Apparently men don't wear cloths,"Firstly, buy this book when its under $40. The prices on here for this book are atrocious. I ended up buying it used for $27. A great drop from the $60+(New and Used)its been for months. This is a great book but it would of been more helpful if it contained more mens fashion. I'm well aware that in manga/anime when it comes to variety with clothes its more about the women but this book acted as if male manga characters hardly wear clothes. Most of the characters I draw are male so for me this book was pretty much useless. On top of that I think the book is pretty repetitive. After 7 or 8 pages I'm pretty sure you'll know how to draw folds and wrinkles in a shirt. This book will be a wonderful reference if I need it when drawing female characters. In all its a nice add to the How To Draw series just wish it had more variety."
5,Excellent Book,"Very well made book, with a wide range of complexity for everyone. Dinosaurs look superb, and the treasure is the Steg at the end. A big challenge, and very time consuming, but looks Awesome! Very good book to have. Recommend it to any origamist."
2,Not the easiest to follow,"I wish that I had read more reviews for this book. This was the first time attempting to do origami and the instructions were so hard to follow. I heard that origami was supposed to be relaxing...not so much! If you have been doing origami for a while and know the folds, then I suppose that it would be quite enjoyable but if you are a first time 'attempter' or a beginner I would look into something else."
5,"Great book, easy to follow diagrams","I am a fan of John Montroll's work and have tried my hand at folding many of his models. I bought this book to make an Origami Dinosaur collection and found that the diagrams are really easy to follow and are clear, too.These designs, however, are for people who have had some experience folding origami and are confortable with steps such as sinks, etc.Except for a few designs at the very beginning (which are plain and simple) the rest of the book details out intermediate to complex models.John has also taken the pains to categorize each of the designs / dinosaurs into the level of complexity. So you can go ahead and buy this book and fold the designs as per your experience and comfort levels."
1,this book doesn't stick,I bought this book for a rainy afternoon and it was just awful. Had the stickers come off cleanly and then actually stuck to the pages it would have been alot of fun and a great learning tool as a bonus for my kids. I was very disapointed. Just because something only costs $5 doesnt mean it shouldn't work properly.(I DID not purchase this from Amazon but a competitor in the actual store)My kids love stickers and the idea was great - could have been alot of fun...I'd avoid this one.
1,Sure to frustrate your child,"At least half the stickers in this book don't come off cleanly, making this book an exercise in frustration. But something else."
3,Don't bother astronomy students,"This film was very dissapointing and not at all what I expected.There were only a few glimpses of the Sun and not enough explanation about its properties: how it generates nuclear fusion; how and why the Sun shines; its position on the HR diagram/comparison to other stars; apparent brightness, etc. I thought this would be a great film to summarize information on the Sun for my descriptive astronomy class.Don't bother wasting your money. I am not impressed!"
5,The Cosmic Blueprint,"In 1987, James Gleick released Chaos, which was regarded as a seminal work in the subject, but in the same year, a much less popularised book by Paul Davies - The Cosmic Blueprint was also released - a vastly wider-ranging and advanced introduction to the theory of Complexity, as chaos came to be known.Davies' book clearly explains the fundamental concepts and ties them all in - emergence, nonlinearity, the second law, self-organization, stochastic structures, complex and dynamic systems, darwinism and creativity - in all their cosmological and terrestial implications, with excellent philosophy to back it.This is an absolute must-read for anyone interested in contemporary science. It still stands as a classic explication of an emerging new scientific paradigm which is now in full swing, and which Davies called and contextualized years ahead of his time.If you read one science book in your life, this should be it."
3,"Tired of reading the same old zhit about ""The Homeless""....?","Are you tired of reading the same old zhit about ""The Homeless""? Then check out a book that was actually WRITTEN by a homeless person, namely, me, Ace Backwords, author of ""SURVIVING ON THE STREETS: How To Go Down Without Going Out."" Available from amazon.com"
4,Good Collection of a fine group,"A very enjoyable collection by a group who had the best of Hollywood studio musicians and production all around them...Leon Russell, Carl Radle, et al. Especially nice to have the ""b"" sides of some singles. My only suggestion would have been to leave off Gary's self admitted sub par performance of ""Sealed With A Kiss"" and include his just-as-good-if-not-better than original ""Rhythm of the Rain"""
5,Rock and Roll at his Best Gary Lewis!,"This C.D.brings back the good o'l days of rock&roll. Gary Lewis is at his best,! Hope you get time to listen to this C.D. This Diamond Ring and Everybody Loves a Clown and the rest of the other 23 songs on this C.D. Long live Rock&Roll !"
3,Not for heavy use,I bought this to replace what I thought was an identical hook that broke after very heavy use. This hook is weaker than the previous one with only one tiny screw holding the hook to the base. I'm sure it's fine for hanging clothes. Just don't plan on alternative uses with heavy loads.
3,3.5 stars,A nice album by Annihilator. In some tracks it reminds me Korn a Little bit (i dislike Korn) but the guitars are doing a good work. The solos in some tracks are very fast. What i don't like in Annihilator is the vocals. I never liked the vocals. A must for Annihilator fans
2,emo this,"This sounds like emo or screamo, whatever you call it, and done bad. Even though the title track is engaging the rest is almost embarrassing. It sounds like a insecure desperate album trying to hit a new generation of fans. It fails! Just as shocking Jeff Waters and the same signer Dave Padden rebound a year later and release my favorite Annihilator album in a long, long time 'Schizo Deluxe'. How they make probably their worst album 'All For You' then the next year make one of their best is beyond me."
3,Change of pace,"The newest Annihilator reminded me of a collection of B sides for a group with a Class A collection of works. This album is really a more 'in your face' type heavy/trash metal album mixed with some complex multi part songs which were the reason for my B side feeling. The new line up gives the band a sound that is maybe more new metal, but definitely lessens the power behind the songs. Louder and messier is not always more powerful. It makes you miss the sophisticated savagery of the previous line up which had a feeling of a laser guided missile attack. If you are looking for surgically played Trash Metal like 'Never Neverland' or 'Refresh the demon', this album will be a little harder for you to enjoy. If you are a true Annihilator fan you will want to add this to your collection, but it will probably not become your favorite."
2,Missing episode??,"I bought and downloaded this season. As I was watching each episode I realized an episode was missing. I watched this show on tv when it originally came out and new what episode should be next, it was absent. I found a list of the episodes and it is number 5 that is not there. I feel a little ripped off. The series was pretty in expensive and that was nice, but it would be nice if amazon made sure the complete series is there."
3,BEWARE: episode missing from season 1,"i was happy with the purchase of season 1 of instant star until i sat down to watch it and discovered that episode 5 of the season was missing! it's definitely a distraction because there's no continuity; missing an episode is a lot in the first season of a show where new characters are being introduced and lots of drama is stirred up. i do love the show, but beware before purchasing that the episode is missing and not offered at all from Amazon."
4,love this show,my sister and i LOVE this show. it's awesome.they better put seasons 3 and 4 on dvd SOON!!
4,Instant Hit!,I've been watching this show since it first aired 2 years ago on The N and I was so excited to see it come out on DVD. I love the Instant Star soundtracks! Alexz Johnson has such a great voice! Hopefully the rest of the seasons will follow this one to DVD. And maybe that will inspire the powers that be to release RFR seasons on DVD too!
3,It was ok.,"The small Orchestration and use of the piano and percussion reminded me of a small regional theatre or High School production of ""The Rocky Horror Show"", I liked It very much."
4,Quinn has not missed the mark...,"It's true, there is enough in footnoted references to sustain you in your basement along with all your food storage from the local Stake cannery till dooms day.Knowing Dr. Quinn's writing style, the footnotes should not come as a surprise but only presents exhaustive validity to what he is bold enough to say. Having worked for the Church in the Family and Church History Department, I can say that people still talk about when Quinn worked there years ago. The difference between us and Quinn is we are in the business of being Spiritual Dermatologists: burning off history's warts, creating a pot marked but clean historical image. Quinn does not need to explain him self to those who find his work incorrect, I feel and believe he is not in this for any type of vanity, even historical. Quinn has not missed the mark, LDS historical scholarly works will show, in time, that he has, in fact, defined it!"
2,Caveat Lector,"This book and its companion volume represent a prodigious amount of research. Having said that, though, I also have to warn potential readers that they should not take it at face value. Along with several colleagues, I have examined a representative sample of Quinn's footnotes. Without exception -- literally, without exception -- I have found the notes problematic. They seem padded. The sources cited often appear largely irrelevant to the point made in the main text. Quite frequently, when the sources are actually examined, they don't really turn out to say what Quinn says they do. This is extraordinarily troubling. Few if any of us have the time to look up all of the many, many references -- even if they were easily accessible. I don't have the time myself. But my sample suggests to me that I can't rely on Quinn's scholarship at any point with any degree of real confidence. Others have come to similar conclusions."
2,"Good start, turns into gossip session about church leaders","The book starts out well written, and somewhat convincing, but the book ends with Quinn just passing along gossip about Church Leaders from anonymous employees in the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City. By the end of the book Quinn comes across as bitter about his excommunication and just wants to bad mouth those who got him excommunicated especially Elder Boyd K. Packer."
1,Not to be trusted,"This accuracy of this book is not to be trusted. One reviewer of this book found, in just the first chapter, all of the following: ""(a) blatant misquoting, (b) altering the tone of original reports, (c) making claims without documentation, (d) stretching interpretations of incidents to support claims, (e) ignoring obvious explanations for supposed ""problems,"" (f) reaching false conclusions due to insufficient research, (g) omitting evidence contrary to claims, (h) fabricating supposed contradictions, (i) clinging to apparent contradictions that are resolved by even the slightest serious thinking, (j) drawing conclusions contradicted by the book's own evidence, and (k) actually distorting the record to support a thesis."" (From ""A Betrayal of Trust: Review of The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power by D. Michael Quinn."" Reviewed by Duane Boyce, FARMS Review of Books, Provo, Utah: FARMS, 1997. Pp. 147-63.)"
1,Not the Whole Truth,"I would like to start off by saying that my father is a bishop and I know other good men who are in places of authority in the Mormon church and they are not in those positions ""because they toed the party line, did the right favors or were related to the right people and now profit from book sales and living allowances."" It has been said that Mormons will be critical of this book, and why wouldn't we be? This book is saying people like my dad are liars and deceivers. Believe what you will, but I believe this book is full of lies, regardless of Mr. Quinn's best attempt."
1,Personal Agenda?,"I am not a Mormon, but it is obvious that Mr. Quinn's personal agenda distorts the truth."
5,I wish It came in larger packages with more than 5 sheets,It absolutely has a peel off backing.... I think it works great. I'm trying to find it in larger quantity than just 5sheets per package.If you look at the back of each sheet there's even a cut line to help the user peel off the backing. Anyone that doesn't know how to peel and stick these has bigger problems. There's really no instruction necessary. It's 'peel and stick'. Pretty simple.
1,Office Depot sticks it to you,"You would think that something titled ""print and stick paper"" would allow you, once you had printed on it, to stick it to something. Some kind of adhesive backing, perhaps, with a protective cover you could peel off.But no. Just as it's up to you what you print on this paper, it's up to you apparently to find some kind of glue with which to stick it to some kind of surface.Not only does this product give you absolutely no hint about what glues to use, what surfaces are appropriate, etc.Inside and out, the product avoids even mentioning this little matter of the second verb in its name (""stick"").This is one of the most blatantly misleading rip-off products I have encountered in a good long time."
4,"Good quality, good value","I examined about 15 similar units before choosing this onefor the combination of features and price. No regrets, thisis a fine little tape player / radio. Does what I wanted itto do within what I wanted to spend on it."
5,Cool shape with Rythm,"This is the cassette player I am looking for, cool shape with 3 diffrent rhythm sound, Casio cool"
2,Did not last long.,"Wish I had the model number of the Conair model that I'm using now...it's on Amazon...looks similar but white with a thumb-button on top just back of the nozzle and the release tab is in back rather than under the nozzle. This one I had a long time ago and it stopped working in few months. The one I have now has been working great for four years. Love the warm lather it produces...just hot enough, specially in my slightly cold-during-winter bathroom."
4,Feels like a good workout and fun too!,These DVDs are fun and they feel like a good workout too! I only wish there was a little more time spent on teaching how to do the moves.
4,Fun,Great purchase and I would recommend it for workouts and getting into shape easy to follow instructors and good quality.
2,Disappointing,"This review is for Tahitian Cardio, as I have not yet done the Hip-hop video, although, I am fairly certain I will be disappointed with that as well.I want to start this off by saying I am far from ""in-shape"". I am 5'3 and 200 lbs and have been using work out videos on and off for the last 7 months with moderate success. That being said, to call this work out ""cardio"" is a joke. I am more out of breath from walking up two flights of stairs than I was at any given time while completing this video.However, if you are interested in toning your core, this work-out is probably really great start for you. The instruction is easy to follow and really focuses on your legs, hips, and abs."
5,Great little workout set,"If you are as out of shape as I am, then you will appreciate this nice little workout. It is enough to get your heart rate up a bit and get you sweating. It took me a few tries to get the moves right, but as long as you don't have two left feet like me, you will probably be fine."
4,Pretty fun but repetitive,"I really liked this workout dvd. It's very fun and I am learning the world of hula and tahitian dance. However, the moves are very repetitive. But I guess that is so you can get the hang of it. But when you put it all together at the end of the dvd, the instructor goes off beat sometimes. But that is okay! The dvd is still a fun one to do and to workout the core of your body"
1,Crap,Just boring and not a work out. And blah blah to have enough words to finish the review. And more blah blah.
3,Complicated for the home kitchen,"The recipes in this book are very complicated for the home cook,especially if you are cooking alone. They represent dishes conceived for and prepared in a restaurant kitchen. I'm a competent cook and the 2 dishes that I made were delicious but quite time consuming, and therefore only suitable for special occasions with much beforehand preparation. We've eaten at the restaurant and the food was wonderful, unfortunately difficult to duplicate, as most of the recipes involve multiple ingredients and several stages of preparation."
3,Jane Eyre,"This book is written in the 1800's. It deals with the romanticism period. It shows the struggle that Jane had to go through in order to find her happiness. She has to show Rochester that she is an equal to him in order to make it in life. She once said, ""Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?"" This shows that Jane was different than most of the women in the 1800's. She was more determined to do things on her own, and things that only men were supposed to do. If you like books that deal with love and determination, then you will like this book."
3,"High on Eye Candy, Low on Substance","Mysteries of Egypt, a production by IMAX, introduces viewers to Ancient Egypt. The aerial photography of the river Nile is spectacular and is worth the purchase of that production on its own. Unfortunately, the authors of Mysteries of Egypt spend too much time covering the supposed curse of Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb. To its credit, Mysteries of Egypt can give some viewers a taste for a more substantive, visual overview of Ancient Egypt. Think for instance about Egypt: Beyond the Pyramids by The History Channel or The Mysteries of Egypt by Kultur."
5,An Amazing Experience,I first saw this film at an Imax at the Futuroscope in France. The images in this film are breath-taking as is the narration by Sharif. A MUST for your DVD library!
1,"Bad, bad, bad","I have seen almost all of the IMAX DVDs, and this is by far the worst of the bunch. The back and forth narration of the child and ""wise"" sage is boring and annoying, and most of the scenes don't work well. Don't pick this title up."
4,Stories of King Tut,I bought and watched this before going on a trip to Egypt. Very good quality imax movie and good overview of the stories of King Tut. But if you want a lot of details you have to dig some where else. A good introductory movie for people interested in Ancient Egypt. A little bit short though.
5,Excellent children's documentary.,"This is a favorite DVD in our house. It has stunning camera work, wonderful information and an excellent narrative. It portrays the glory of Ancient Egypt and the pride modern Egyptians still feel towards their heritage.Like all Imax documentaries it's only 40 minutes long and written at a fourth grade level. If you have a problem with those preconditions, don't watch Imax. We're homeschoolers and we love it. My children pay close attention, break out the Legos and start building pyramids of their own."
1,Too hard for my kitties to chew,"Just got them a few days ago for my 3 kitty-cats. And out of the 3, only one kitty has shown some interest in chewing these treats. I am also afraid now in case the kitty that tries to chew them choke the bits in her throat as it is very hard and not as soft as I wished for them to swallow them."
1,Wasted my money!,"I have TWO cats that like to chew on cardboard, paper, wood, pens, pencils.. but won't touch these AT ALL! I tried to microwave them and bend them so cats could reach better but they still had NO interest at all! I thought these were an AWESOME idea but sadly, not for my cats!"
3,Popular but not for chewing,"My 4 year old cat does not chew these toys, she bats them around frantically and shoots them straight under the nearest appliance or rug.I wish she would just chew them, so that I could stop digging around under the stove and the fridge. She really does love them, just not for what they're marketed as.I wish that my 1.5 year old cat would chew these instead of everything else in the house, but she is not interested in them -- she doesn't really stand a chance, though, as they're not out for long before they get hidden."
4,She likes it,"Thought I'd try this treat. My cat, Perr (Periwinkle) was tickled and devoured them. Will buy more of them next time."
2,Cat isn't very interested,"My kitten isn't very interested in these. The shape seems to appeal to her somewhat, as something to bat around, but she doesn't chew them. They are very, very thin and stick straight--unlike the image which looks thicker to me and irregular. They are so thin and straight that they look somewhat dangerous--like the cat could hurt herself if she got the end in her mouth just so. I'll probably throw the rest out or give them to my daughter to see if her cat likes them. However, he isn't the biter--my cat is. This did not help with my problem."
4,1 out of 4 cats love them,"I have 4 cats. One cat absolutely loves these and chews on it like you would see a dog chew on a bone. He eats the entire thing after about 10 minutes. The other 3 cats have no interest in this product.The cat that likes these chews on paper, bags, the wall, furniture, cords, etc. Since feeding him these (I give him one a day when I get home from work), his chewing has been reduced, and he seems very happy to see me now that he knows he'll get not only something to chew on, but something to eat."
3,Cat chew treat,I found this product to be not so appealing to the cats. They sniffed at it and walked away. It just may be meant for different cats for the ones I gave it to are spoiled. I can't rate this good or bad so I chose inbetween. It is a product you may have to try out on your pets for yourself.
3,Only S0-S0,"This is probably a very good product.However,it did nothing to slow down my cat's wire-chewing tendency...Unless you count batting it around...She hasn't chewed it yet!!"
5,A Good Dose of Tonic for all writers,Rosemary uses humor and honesty to provide writers with a good dose of tonic that will revitalize their writing techniques and boost their morale. Her exorcises are helpful in discovering one's own creative self. Her book shares her experiences as well as those of some of her fellow Zona Rosans and her determination to help women improve their writing is evident in her book. Her tone is always encouraging and supportive. I found her book to be one I return to again and again.
5,Be prepared to be jolted off your sofa,"For all women, old or young, who think they'd like to wrie but don't know how to begin, or don't know if they have the right stuff: Secrets of the Zona Rosa is your book.You'll find yourself in every chapter and you'll read how others just like you pulled themselves up to the scary places and prevailed. In her inspiring book, Rosemary Daniell invites you to confront those behaviors you use to discourage yourself--whether they relate to writing or any other aspect of your life. After reading this book, you just might see a whole new person when you look in the mirror."
5,A Book For Writers and Healers,"Daniell has written a wonderful resource book - not only for writers but also for teachers, therapists and others in the healing professions. It's a great read: quick pace, fascinating stories of women in the Zona Rosa, exercises to help one tell their story-especailly if painful, exercises to help one develop their writing skills, and useful information on the writing process. Secrets of the Zona Rosa is a book for men and women serious about writing or telling their stories."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"This company does not live up to their promises when supporting their products. Once they sell you a product, you are essentially on your own if if breaks or does not work as advertised. I do not recommend purchasing ANY of their products. They will leave you high and dry!!!"
4,Great for a Deaf Dog,"The collar feels like a neck massage and it works as billed. The casing on the remote feels cheap and I am worried about how it will hold up. The major draw back to the collar is that there is no on/off switch so the batteries will drain faster then they should and to replace the batteries four tiny screws must first be removed, retained and then screwed back. Considering the quality of the plastic I wonder how long before the holes are stripped. However, the price is low and it is the only collar I could find that does not also shock the dog. I was not confident that I would always hit the right button and this collar is to alert my old dog who has recently gone deaf, to look at me for the recall. She trained to the collar quickly and we have been able to resume our off leash walks through the woods without me worrying how to recall her to my side."
3,short-lived success,"Only worked the first few training periods that we used it on our schnauzer. After that, he didn't even notice the vibration or the tone."
1,"Supplyer Great responce, Manufacture very Poor","Supplier was great quick responces and helpful. Product was defective , but Manufacture failed to answer repeated phone messages.Have gone to different manufacture, would think twice about Pet Zip for anything."
4,Good bargain,"These headphones have good overall sound quality, but the best features are the fully adjusting headband and the volume control on the cord. The angled plug is OK if you need it, but not a big selling feature for me."
5,Cute - Cute - Cute!,"Well thought out anime! I really liked it and the ""NEET"" plot line was well thought out and interwoven in the lives of the characters. There are just enough twists in the plot line to keep one watching the episodes right up until the last one and really left me hoping for more - maybe a follow on??"
3,NANANANANANANANA cheese cake,"The first couple of episodes are good, and the last few episodes are good, but the others are just meh. The animation is solid, and I think this is one of the better dubs I have heard. Most of the story deals with yakuza but it gets really repetitive at some point. The characters are for the most part entertaining with a few exceptions."
5,Heaven's Memo Pad,"While the other reviewers have accuratley told much of this storyline without spoiling it,not mentioned was that while there are a few light-hearted moments,this series starts out and remains on serious and sometimes heartbreaking themes. It isn't,by any stretch, a comedy and involves no eichi at all. People die,including teenagers. Brutality runs as an undercurrent throughout this,very excellent series. Well drawn,played and written,it is one of the most superb anime series of the ""season"". I do agree there is too much yakuza but it is in the Saboya district of Tokyo,after all."
4,Love it,"great product. A slight smell when I opened the air tight packaging, But went away fast...It is very comfortable and helps me sleep longer and better..Would recommend this and price was great..came quickly also..."
4,Sleep Better 2 Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper,We purchased this product because our daughter's bed at school was uncomfortable. She noticed a dramatic increase in comfort and could finally sleep all night.We highly recommend it.
3,memory foam topper,"I bought this two weeks into my college semester because the beds they supply us with are horrendous. I wouldn't go as far as to say this mattress topper is amazing/magical etc; however, i now sleep very well throughout the night and have no complaints!"
3,sleep better 2-inch visco elastic memory foam mattress topper full,"The mattress is comfortable, but it is smaller than full size mattress. So pillow slips down of mattress all the time."
5,"Very good, nice and comfy!","I really like this item. It took a few hours to unroll, so it could be placed on my bed.There is indeed an odor, but it diminished a great deal in those hours, and within a few daysis no longer noticeable to me. I do have a quilted mattress cover over it,and it fits nicely.I chose the 2 inch because I didn't know how I would like it, or if it would make a difference.If I had it to do over, I would spend the money and choose a thicker one. Don't get me wrong, eventhe 2 inch makes a difference, but I think a 4 inch would be better still.This has made my good bed a better one. There is a lot less pressure on my hips.If you are considering purchasing this item, do spend the extra for a slightly thicker version, though.I think that if I had, I would be even more delighted."
3,Ain't bad...,"But ain't great. I only have one other mattress pad to compare it to, but I think that I was expecting a little more out of it. Not bad for the money though."
4,Sleep Better 2-Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper,"It is very comfortable. However the smell was atrocious. The recommendation by vendor was to let it air out a couple days due to smell of foam. You will want to let it air out at least 4-5 days. If you put sheets and/or mattress protector on this mattress cover before then, your linens will have the same foam smell and it is almost impossible to get out. It will take multiple washings before the smell dissapate from you linens. If you follow this advice, you will probably be happy with the product. If you are ultra-sensitvie to smells, you may want to avoid product all together.Sleep Better 2-Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper, Queen"
5,Happy with product,Had no issue with pad smelling after it aired out for two hours. My kids love them so far. Will pos back in a few months to report how they are holding up.
3,Feels good,"This product was advertised as having elastic, but it is just the memory foam pad, nothing to hold it onto the mattress pad. It feels GREAT though! Such a good gift."
2,not good,"This does keep the springs from poking me, Not thick enough for the futon. Wish I had opened it when I first got it I would have returned it. I opened months later after delivery"
4,comfy,I dont think this had a bad odor at all. It did smell a little like plastic and petroleum when I first got it but that smell soon disappeared.
5,"Sleep Better 2-Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper, Twin Sleep Better",I gave this as a Christmas gift. The person loved it . Just what she wanted. Nice quality of merhandise.
2,"Smells funny, but feels great","I'm surprised that there weren't as many comments about how strange the foam smells. I worry sometimes about what chemicals I might be breathing in... but the foam is comfy as advertised so if you aren't too sensitive to funny smells, this is a good buy."
1,Wasn't Feelin' the Love!!,"My husband and I tried it on our king size bed and:a.)the ""newness scent"" never went away after a few weeks...it was STRONG!b.)it felt like we were sleeping in a hammock- and we are both small and lightc.)it made the bed feel too spongyGuess it depends on what you're used to sleeping on as to whether or not you would like the feel of this, but as for myself, I would rather sleep on the floor than to sleep on one of these again!"
4,Decent quality for the price.,"This mattress topper exceeded my expectations. When I first received it, it was all smushed up from shipping. Initially, I was disappointed, it was too small for my mattress and mishapen. I gave it time to air and reconstitute as recommended by the packaging. After a few hours it was full size and fully puffed up. It makes an amazing difference in the feel of our mattress. My husband noticed the difference immediately, even though I hadn't told him about it. FYI--I have a very good Sleep Number mattress, but it's appearance is a little lumpy, so I bought this purely to give the bed a smoother appearance and was pleasantly surprised at the quality--especially for the price.) I don't know how much difference one would get by purchasing the 3"" topper instead of this one, but this one noticeably improved the surface quality of themattress. For the price, this is a good value."
1,Smells like plastic,"Smelled so much of plastic even after opening and airing it out, that I had to wrap it up again and return. Great idea, but couldn't take the odor of the stuff, gave me a headache. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,I couldn't stand the smell,"I've read reviews that mentioned the smell, so I was prepared, or so I thought. After 4 days of airing the mattress I calld it quits and send it back.It did feel like a good quality memory foam. Too bad that it smells so bad (like something rotten)."
5,2 Inch Foam Topper,"I love this item. Wanted one for a long time and thought the price and reviews from Amazon were great. Arrived super fast. Was concerned about chemical smell from other reviews, but I did not mind after the sheet was put on. Smelled a bit like paint, but went away fairly quick I'd say. Fits the bed well and you can move around without disturbing the other person."
4,Nice Pad,"Nice Pad. For me, it does release bit of back pain.Make sure you are OK with those three well identified problems: odor, hot, and soft. The size is smaller than the mattress, but buying a king size for queen is not necessary. A few inches short under the fitted sheet is not noticeable at all."
2,It's OK but nothing special,"We've had this foam mattress topper for a couple of weeks and it's OK but nothing special. It does not significantly improve the comfort of the bed, nor provide any improvements in sleep quantity or quality."
3,Smaller...,It is comfortable. However the note in the packaging says that it is intentionally made smaller than the standard size (queen size is what I ordered) so that when it is slept on it does not flex outside the bed.It does not make sense for me.Even when I lay on it it does not get bigger.Might be a way to put less memory foam into the product and save money by the manufacturer.No objectionable smell detected.If I buy something like this in the future I would consider a 3 inch-thick version.
3,giftgiver,I gave this to my daughter for Christmas. I told her to let it air as previous reviews had said it had an odor. She did not notice any odor. The two nights she has slept on it she feels she did not toss and turn as before. She seems to like it.
2,low,I bought one a few years ago and it made the mattress so much softer and I thought this one was like it. I think I ordered it from here but maybe it was from overstock.My mattress is so hard and so I wanted one for this mattress. I'm disappointed because it's still so hard. It doesn't make the mattress any better.
5,happy nappy,This mattress topper changed my day bed from a lumpy place that I could never get comfortable on to my favorite place to take a great happy nappy!!!
5,sleep better has the rrght name,i have had broken bones that lead to a lot of pain i couldnt sleep more than 3 hrs with out getting up an walking around. after i got the sleep right i am guilty of staying in bed to much it just feels too good. no more pain pills or sleeping pills thanks sleepbetter.vivian hutchins
4,i think i love it,"I received this two days ago and slept on it for the first time last night. I have a brand new bed that is too hard and too late to take back. My neck/shoulders and back always hurt in the morning, so I needed something soft and was thinking memory foam or pillow top? I think I love this. There was a strong chemical smell when I first opened it up, but you are supposed to air it out for a few days before putting it on your bed; the included information sheet says as much. It is definitely memory foam, nice and thick, 2"". I moved less during the night than I usually do, but was also a little warmer than I usually am. In response, I will continue sleeping on the foam but will lighten up on the covers. A good buy so far, and a good price. I've never slept on memory foam before and it's a nice change. If you hate memory foam, don't buy this thing. No pain this morning, so I am calling it a success."
4,"Recommended, Good Quality, Not As Soft As Expected","I was expecting a softer foam topper, one that would ""hug"" you more while lying on it. Maybe I'd like it thicker, or with less dense foam. Either way, softer would probably not actually be better for back health in the long run. All I'm saying is don't expect something super soft and squishy.It does make my bed better, and I've woken up without any soreness most mornings. You definitely don't want to get out of bed! It is shipped in a plain box, bound up inside a black trash bag on the inside. Just unroll it, and it will expand to its full 2-inch thickness. There's no obnoxious odor to worry about. Worth the $42 I paid for it!"
5,Queen Size Memory Foam Mattress Topper,The mattress topper had just enough foam to soften a hard mattress and still be able to use my special sheets.
4,Overall I am satisfied with this purchase,"I believe I paid around $70 for this foam topper and it is quite comfortable. My original mattress was a bit too hard for me and after adding this topper my bed does feel more comfortable to sleep on. I sleep on a queen, but bought a king from what the other reviews recommended. Reason being is because the queen is a bit small and the king was a bit large, so you could just trim the king foam topper for the ideal fit. I do agree that the foam topper has a very weird smell, but once you air it outside for a day or two the smell does go away. Overall, I think it was a good purchase for the price."
1,I guess these other reviews are just marketing,"I bought this thanks to all of the terrific reviews. However, it's just a stinky industrialized piece of foam which has made my pretty-good mattress pretty unbearable. Now that the humidity has arrived, the foam seems to magnify sweating.So, I've tried it for two months and am now certain that others should save their money. Buy a new mattress if you need one, but don't buy this."
1,Retains body shape too long,"The first night was great but by the 3rd or 4th night we noticed that the mattress was not returning to its shape.That caused an uncomfortable feeling which was totally unacceptable. I believe it was because it was not thick enough but as well, it needs to be at least 4LB density and it is only 2.5LB."
4,Good Product,"This unpackaged nicely, it took a couple of hours to unshrink from the packaging. But after that, very comfortable to sleep on. I really like it."
3,Memory Foam has mixed results,"The memory foam does seem to make our 20-some year old mattress more comfortable. We started with a 1/2 inch pad. When that stopped reforming itself, we replaced it with one inch pad. The problem we are having now is that the pad does not re-form itself over the 17 hours or so between sleeping. So the indentations where we sleep and the ridges around them seem to be becoming more and more pronounced, making it somewhat more difficult at times to more from one spot to another on the bed."
1,Crap,"The topper smelled, was wrapped in a black trash bag and it did not measure up. LITERALLY! It would have better fit a twin mattress with some minor trimming!!!!"
5,Love it!,I absolutely love it. Great price & It is incredibly comfortable and perfect for college dorm mattresses (that annoying Twin XL that is hard to find)
5,Sleep so much better!,"I bought this in hopes that we would not have to go out and buy a whole new mattress set. So far, SO GOOD! Slept on it last night and did not toss and turn all night long (like i normally do) and didn't feel stiff or sore when i woke up. Best investment i've made in awhile!"
4,Very Comfortable,"We bought this product to on top of our 15 year old mattress in our travel trailer. First we were glad that we had open it up and let it air our for a couple days before we needed to be in the trailer as it did have a odor, especially in a small space. The lenght was a little short but that wasn't a problem, it was not 70""L.We were very happy with the result of this 2"" mattress. We will try putting non slip rubber mat in between as someone else suggested because it slips but other than that we are getting another one for other bed now."
5,Amazing!,"I put my mattress pad on right away when I had gotten it. Although it did have a smell to it, it was all worth it! SOOOOOO comfortable. Not only that, but the mattress pad got shipped to the wrong address. When they found this out, they were very apologetic and shipped it one day shipping. This mattress pad is totally worth the money and the company does a great job keeping the customer happy!!:)"
4,Memory Foam Topper,This product is great I sleep so much better now. I have a metal plate and pins in my right leg from an old car accident and it's gotten harder to sleep on just a regular matress this Memory Foam has helped a lot. The olny downside is the odor from it being packaged. I recomend you give it a good 48hrs with lots of air to relax and help the odor dissipate. The instructions say 24hrs but I recommend 48 and some fabreeze. Other than that I would highly recommend this product over buying an entire new bed.
4,"comfortable, but a bit stinky","It took about 2-3 days for the pad to resume a normal shape after being shipped compressed. There was a definite odor that lasted a few weeks. I'm hoping the product isn't made of any harmful substances since I'm pregnant. Now I don't notice the odor. Very comfortable. For the price, overall very satisfied with the purchase."
2,Soft but Smells,"I like the memory foam except for the smell! I let my foam air out for about two weeks and still had to put it under two mattress covers to try to keep the smell down. I still get a whiff of the smell sometimes when turning over. I have bought other brands before that came with a cover and I did not have this problem. The smell may not bother most people, I am more sensitive to smells than most. The memory foam adds new life to a mattress!"
4,Does what it's supposed to do.,"Bought this for a cheap n hard mattress in the family vacation condo. It worked exactly as advertised, providing just enough ""give"" that I can sleep comfortably on the bed. I was worried that two inches wouldn't make a difference, but the pad seems to be made of good quality memory foam with enough stiffness that it doesn't completely flatten out under your entire body. Splurge on one of those full sized memory foam pillows and you will really improve your sleep. We left it opened in the garage for 24 hours and even my mother, ""Mrs. Picky Nose"" did not notice any peculiar smells. Only criticism is that it could be an inch wider and a few inches longer."
5,Excellent value,"This memory foam was much less expensive than what i could find elsewhere, but I could see nothing wrong with its quality. My son uses it on his mattress and says it is great."
1,The Smell,"The product was very comfortable to sleep on but once it got cold and I had to close the window, a chemical-like smell filled the room, I will definitely be returning this after only an hour of dealing with the smell. I see online this is common so I don't understand how it can have a 4.0/5 rating"
3,Pros and cons,"Definitely soft and cushiony, changing the feel of a too-firm-for-my-husband mattress. Seemed good quality visco-elastic to me. Unfortunately, we experienced its effect of keeping too much heat, so had to do away with it eventually."
5,so worth it,"I bought this mattress topper for my son's twin bed that was as hard as a rock (extra firm) and it was so worth it. Now his bed is so soft and comfortable. Once you lay down it's hard to get up. He's sleeping much better now. Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on a new mattress, I bought this product and couldn't be happier. I highly recommend it.Sleep Better 2-Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper, Queen"
4,good or bad depending if you reach your sweet spot before falling asleep.,i find that the foam is so thick that if you are in a warm room it will easily make you sweat. also if you have a bad back this will do nothing to help since if you don't find your sweet spot before falling asleep. you will stay that way all night. this can be very good or bad depending on each knit.
3,Decent,"I think this memory foam works great in the first 2 months, but then starts sagging in the high pressure points (butt area)."
5,HELP! I don't want to get out of bed.,"I'm writing this review from my bed which I now find to be so comfortable, I don't want to get up.I originally bought this to put on a hard futon that guests sleep on.But I found it to be so comfortable that I'm using it on my bed now.It arrived compressed and needed about 24 hours to expand to its full size.Even at its full size, it is a 1-2"" smaller than my queen size mattress.I think this is on purpose so that your fitted sheets will still fit.It did smell a little but that went away in a few days.I recommend airing it out in the garage or on a patio.I have been using it for a month now and I has definitely improved my sleep.I used to toss and turn a lot more. I would wake up in the middle of the night and find my arm was numb.Now the bed conforms to me and I feel less pressure points. My wife also feels she gets better quality sleep on this mattress and doesn't feel as achy when she wakes up."
2,I would love it if...,"The foam mattress really is wonderful to sleep on, however, the plastic odor is extremely strong. So strong, that I still smell it after 2 months. I would return it, but it really has no guarantee to speak of.If you are sensitive to ""new car"" smell, purchase something else.A mattress covering would be nice too. It doesn't come with one, so expect little pill balls when you change sheets."
1,Broke down after 1mth of use... garbage,"Do not waste your money on this POS item. The mattress was firm only for the first two weeks, and then it slowly started breaking down. It's been 3 months since I bought it and I ended up dumping it in the trash today. After a months use the topper was firm in some areas but extremely soft in others, I still decided to give it a shot but after my back/neck started to ache becuase of the toppers insufficient lumbar support I decided to call it quits. I only bought this item because of the rave reiviews on Aamazon and I thought it would be a good addition to my old matterss, but I was wrong. I've been sleeping on my old mattress for the last two weeks and my back/neck issues have vanished. I do not recommend this product."
4,Sleep Better 2 inch Memory Foam,"I bought this for the typical military mattress I had to sleep on. It made the coils and springs digging into my back disappear. I love it and sleep much better now, but have only had it for a month. I cannot speak to how long it lasts, but it should work well for the period I need. At the price sold on Amazon it was worth the $. This is the 3rd memory foam topper I've slept on and they always work better than a plain mattress. I recommend you try this out if you've never slept on one before, and if you like it then step up to a genuine mattress."
2,memory lost,within one week the product has failed to have any memory!now its just a uneven pad.poor quality!
5,Catch Some Zzzz's,"I have purchased this memory foam in both Full and Queen sizes and do not want to live without it. When living in a colder climate I never had a problem with it being too hot but after living in the south it is miserable in the summer time. The heat not withstanding this is the most comfortable topper I've ever slept on. As for the smell other reviewers have complained of, there is an initial odor but it does dissipate and really it never bothered me."
4,Not As Good As Might Seem At First,"It makes it soft to lay on especially at first. But whether it is good for your back, nobody knows. It will make it better if you frequently have poor circulation in a leg or an arm and get sleepy limbs. Whether its good for your back depends what kind of scoliosis you have. If your back is curved how can a soft surface help? It will help it stay curved. So I recommend you check with your doctor if its likely to be good for you.I liked it at first because it made my muscles more relaxed, but later my back started to feel uncomfortable again."
1,Waste of money,"First of all this product was about two feet short in width and length than my mattress and yes I ordered the correct size. Second, after airing the product out according to the instructions, the whole upstairs smelled. And third, comfortable? What comfort? This product was a waste of money!"
3,"Okay, but not great","I wanted to make my bed a little softer and memory foam does this okay but I would have preferred a regular foam or ""egg crate"" topper which used to be available for half the price."
2,2-Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper,"I purchased this topper for my son's twin bed and when we got it, it wasn't what I thought it would be, good quality dense memory foam. The seller isn't really clear about the specifications, so now I am more carefull and making sure that the specs are listed. We returned the product and are looking for new one."
4,Skeptical but tried and really like,"We have had a regular mattress for quite some time now. I had heard that these mattress toppers were good in previous reviews. I decided to try the 2 inch based on a review that said the 3 inch was just too much. The topper arrived in a few days after purchase in a much smaller box than I anticipated, but once we took it out it expanded to what I was expecting. There is a bit of a smell with it, but that goes away after a few days. I have some newer sheets that have that deep pocket and with the topper, the sheets actually fit the bed much better now. I really enjoy the topper and sleep much better now. I was afraid we might get hot, but that is not the case. My husband has issues sleeping due to back pain and he has noticed a considerable decrease in pain and is also sleeping better. I would recommend this item for anyone that uses just a regular mattress. It was well worth the money."
3,Nice Mattress Topper but ...,It was very good for about 2 weeks then I noticed the foam started to soften. I still use it but I wish it stayed firmer for a longer period of time.
4,Stinky but really comfortable,This mattress took about 1 month to lose its strange plastic odor but it is the most comfortable and durable foam mattress I have ever seen.
2,Breaks in to fast,"The foam broke in 1-2 months, now that it is broken in and out of it's original form, it is not as comfortable when I first got it."
3,Good product overall,"This is comfortable, and did help me sleep better on my softer mattress. My only complaint really is that it is not Queen size, I let this 'air out' from the packaging for two days, and it was still about 4 inches short for the length of the bed. This may not matter to someone that does not stretch out in bed, however I am 6'2"" and this bothered me.I replaced my soft mattress with a firmer one. Then I placed this on the futon that I have in my living room, it is full size, then just put the futon cover over it, and to be honest, I have started to fall asleep about once a week watching a movie or listening to music because it is way more comfortable and since it is full size I do not have the expectation that I will be stretching out as much."
5,Solution to an y bad mattress!!!!,This gave me one of the best nights sleep i ever got. it's truly amazing and i don't wake up at all. I would tell you to get the 3' one though if you are over 140 cause it's just enough for me but someone heavy us going to need a little more support. Get it though!!!!!!
4,Nice!,This mattress topper is very comfortable! It doesn't come with a cover though. It needs to be layed out for 4-5 hours so it can bounce back to its shape before using. A good buy!
5,very nice,"the topper is great. arrived earlier than expected . it took only an hour before i placed on top of mattress . it feels so relaxing , didn't want to get up in the morning . lol . very clean and abslutely no unwanted odor . price perfect. and i recommand it to everyone having problem sleeping."
3,just o.k.,"This topper was purchased to put over a mattress that was originally a bunk bed mattress.It was not as dense as a topper I purchased several months back. So as the other purchase a few months back was a better,this topper was o.k. for the price.The 12 year old's bed that it went on still made it a more comfortable bed for him but could have been better."
1,strong chemical smell had to remove from the house,"The chemical smell was too overwhelming. I love foam toppers and have never had this problem. There is a large note warning to air it out for 24 hours and not to touch it with bare hands..but why wasnt this in the description so as to avoid buying it all together. because of the size once it expands...its impossible to return. the bedroom still smells after removing the product. wasted money and worse im concerned of the exposure myself and 4 kids had to the odor until i was able to remove it and that still lingers on the bed.UPDATE: i just bought a great topper on amazon.NO smell at all, if interested in this kind see my reviews..great topper and no odor or chemicals to touch."
2,Not dense enough...,"Others have noted this, but the foam density here is just plain bad. This feels like a cheap piece of foam, with just a touch of ""memory foam"" feel to the recovery. I have purchased other memory foam toppers that are much better; this one bottoms out and is a disappointment for half-a-hundred dollars spent."
3,Gets the job done,"I just purchased this mattress pad. I'm a college student, and I thought I could tough it through the first year with the uncomfortable bed, but it ended up being truly unbearable. In response to the reviews saying the pad has a strong odor, I'm not experiencing that at all. Currently laying on it, I can't smell it from under my sheets. The fit is not perfect. But it is comfortable and makes my life a little better."
1,Sleeping in a swamp,"I'm sorry but I absolutely dislike This product! It smells HORRIBLE, and after one night, I woke up in what felt like a swamp and I am not a night sweater. I broke out in itchy hives as an added bonus!"
4,Great Mattress Topper,"Ok, this product is great. I brought it for my daughter for her first year at colllege and she said it sleeps great! She said it is very comfortable, does not feel hot at night and there is no smell at all. I let it air out for 1 week before we took her and the memory foam to school. I read many articles and reviews on memory foam and this was the best memory foam topper for the price and it had the most positive reviews. If you let the mattress air out for about 5 days, you will not smell the so called chemical odor, if you do your nose is just to sensitive. I don't think you will go wrong if you buy this memory foam."
2,The bottom of the foam barrel.,"I just have to read the reviews befor I buy and I suggest everyone do the same. This pad is 2and1half pounds per cubic feet. That is abot the lowest grade there is. If you read the review befor you buy you wil save your self some money (return shipping)snd some hassel. Plus many of the review said the pad only last 6 months to a year. If someone was go to be spending a lot of time in bed due to an illness, then maybe buying would make sence. The Product I am reviewing is the 2"" memory foam, Twin size."
2,Whoa! The Smell!,"Before buying this I read a few reviews about the horrible smell but they were in the small minority so I bought it anyway. Well, The smell is REALLY bad. There's a little tag on the inside when you open it that says you ""may"" notice have a ""new"" smell for a while. I don't know how anyone could miss it. And the word ""new"" is kind to say the least. They suggest letting it air out for 8 hours. We let it air out for over a week and it still smells really bad. We have a pillow top and a fitted sheet over it and that doesn't seem to reduce the smell much. It's very comfortable however, and we can at least sleep through the smell. We're sticking with it for now. Maybe if a few years it will lose it's smell."
2,Mfg. really needs to consider odor cover scent,"After 5 days (2 outside on the balcony) and 3 on the bed, it still had a smell sort of like chocolate/turpentine which permeates all the bedding, including what you are sleeping in. So I put it back outside for another night. The pitch was it only needed 10 hours to air out. (Mfg. needs to consider a cover scent). I was just about to give up on it, so I sprinkled it with Arm&Hammer; carpet soda and vaccumed, got a plastic zipper mattress bag and had a wonderful night's sleep on my old spare bed. I suspect the soda may bring down the topper's lifespan, however.If not for the stink problem, I'd give it a five star."
3,Memory Foam Bed Topper,"2"" 3lb. Memory Foam (Visco Elastic) Mattress Pad Topper Overlay (Queen Size)by Sleep Better. This products edges could fit the mattress better, we had to place it under a fitted quilted mattress pad in order to contour the edges. If purchasing another we would probably try the 3"" as a minimum thickness."
3,Cmfortable but smelly!,"This is a great solution to that older mattress that needs a boost - my son really loves it and sleeps great. And the price is outstanding. However, it does smell badly - he doesn't seem to mind, but I don't think I could stand it. I let it air out (outside) for 3 days, but it still smells awful, even after several months of use. I've owned multiple memory foam products, and never experienced this before. If I could have returned it easily, I probably would have done so, but shipping a mattress back is a huge hassle, especially when he is happy with it. So, we are keeping it for now, but I doubt I would buy this again, only because of the smell."
5,Great comfortable addition to any mattress.,"I love this topper. I am currently stationed in Afghanistan and the mattresses they give us here are very low quality where you can feel the springs with every move. Well, this topper solved that issue. It is comfortable and completely blocks out the springs on my crappy mattress. I only got the 2in and weigh about 210 and this thing still works great! Some of my fellow soldiers got 3 or 4 inches, and they love theirs too. The 2 inches I got are perfect and do not allow me to sink in too much so that when I turn it is not uncomfortable. It provides the perfect amount of padding without too much of that sinking feeling. It did not stink like some others say and it was ready to go on my bed within minutes of having unrolled it. Great buy! Wish I had gotten it last deployment."
5,Good Sleep,"Have had it for several months now and memory still works like new. My wife and I both get a better nights sleep now.I was a bit leery about only 2"" vs. 3"" or 4"" but 2"" is plenty."
5,Great for dorm beds,"Used for a dorm bed (Twin XL), world of a difference it made.- Thick enough to do a good job cushioning and supporting- Cheap enough to be worth it"
1,Horrible smell,"This foam topper is comfortable enough, but the smell never goes away. When it first arrived, we aired it out in a spare room for a week. Then we put it on the bed, thinking that the smell would gradually dissipate. It never did. After several months, we aired it outside for several days. It still smells. Not recommended if you are the least bit sensitive to a bad odor."
2,after a year this sucks!,"I liked this at first but now after a year of use it is getting really painful to sleep on my bed. I did some research and realized that this foam is 2.5lbs/square foot which is not enough support for even pixies like me. you need at least 4-5lb density foam, this is half of what i should have got. I am only 110 lbs, my bf is 150, and there are uncomfortable indentions in the foam now that dont spring back :("
5,Excellent!,"Ordered a full size for my boyfriend for his birthday. I went through every mattress topper on amazon to find a great topper and chose this particular one due to the amount of reviews, the actual reviews, and the affordable price. He is a volunteer firefighter and gets back pains often. When I sleep over, his feather topper just kills my back when I wake up. Once he had put this dream sleeper on his bed, I haven't had ANY bad back mornings since. He absolutely LOVES it and falls asleep within minutes of laying down because it is so comfortable. It is the PERFECT mattress pad. I just ordered one for my mom for Mother's Day because I was so impressed with how much it really does help. I did standard shipping and received the package within 2 days of ordering it. Kudos to you Amazon."
5,His/Hers Bed Solution,"My husband needs a super firm bed due to back problems. We just bought a new mattress for him and for 2 nights I was absolutely miserable while he slept like a dream. We have a king size bed, so I came on here and ordered a twin pad that would cover only my side. It couldn't get here quick enough! The foam quality is excellent and while it is a little strange that my side of the bed is 2 inches higher than his, it makes it possible for both of us to be completely comfortable at night. Definitely an answer to prayers!"
5,Soooooo much better,I have a super firm mattress which is great for support but not the most comfy for side sleeping or just relaxing in bed. This topper has made the world of a difference. It was easy to put on (I didn't let it air out for very long but the smell didn't bother me at all). I thought the edge of the mattress would look strange with the topper but it doesn't bother me at all. This topper is an inexpensive easy way to make a not so good mattress a lot better.
3,Too small for double bed,Somewhat dissapointed as the mattress foam was a bit small for double bed. It's quite comfortable to sleep on but must beware in summer it heats up your body and makes you sweat quite a bit...
5,sleeping in the clouds,"This elastic memory foam mattress improved my sleeping position and less movement at night. no turning and tossing. Even friends love it, i would recommend to others. Great for (SI)... :)"
2,Bad Packaging....this is an item I suppose to sleep on.,"The product is good, but it is not packed properly and dust was all over it. I return it as soon as I receive it."
4,Visco Matress Topper,"Super comfortable, really made a difference in the quality of comfort without having to spend big dollars for a new mattress. Would definitely recommend. The only drawback is a lingering smell from the foam."
5,Great timing and product.,"My husband loves these shows, and I order him the seasons on Amazon cause they always cost less than if I went to Walmart. The product got here 3 days after ordering it and it was brand new and still had the wrapping. I was very pleased with it."
4,good DBZ season2,im collectin all the dragon ball z episodes and wen i bought this it was good of course it got better wen goku arrived in namek and showed his powers but the startin was okae. i would recommend this item bcuz overall itz a good collecter set!
4,Great fun for a great kid!,My grandson loves Dragonball! This was a good gift for him. I need to order more Dragonball seasons for his birthday.
5,dragon ball z!,"I absolutely love this serie!!!! i grew up with it, im 20 now, and look forward to completing the serie becuase i didn't get to see it all when i was younger so now i plan to collect and have these for my own. My sister and i, being girls, are excited while others are kinda iffy becuase it's usually a guy thing. I go her hooked onto this as well so she wants to help with buying these so that we have the completed set. If you grew up with this, which it's only remastered quality, no change to the actual show except for the dragon ball z kai now, it's just as i remembered it except for the theme music, rock the dragon and missed hearing that before the show started so that was disappointing but the show it self is great. If you doubt buying this and are thinking of getting something entirely different: DON'T!!!! don't miss out on adding this to your dvd collection becuase someday they might not ever have this again for you to get so get it now or face he consequences!"
5,Dvd Review,Its classic dragon ball z and its great only thing that sucks is the music is i guess the orginal from japan not what they had on toonami 10 or so years ago which is a little bummer. still if your a fan buy it.
2,framing the argument,"Dragonball deserves better, the fans deserve better.I was concerned with the Widescreen issue and find that I just don't like it. I was annoyed by how often characters' heads are cut off or just touching the edge of the frame. It's often the case that the missing area would've given just enough room to give the shot some(needed) breathing room. As it is, it feels cramped, not just that something is missing.I was hoping to own the series some day but I just don't want to invest in another flawed attempt that leaves the door open for yet another dip into the pot of gold that the fans represent.How can The distributor miss the point after 2 'uncut' versions that clearly reflects the desire for the original version? Stop 'fixing' it, okay?It boggles the mind that a series that has earned it's place of honor, in so many ways, can't escape tampering."
1,No spanish audio track means no spanish market,"I can't believe they would not add the spanish (Intertrack Mexico) audio track. The ultimate uncut series did have it, why would they leave it out this time. In you tube comparisons, it has been voted the best after the original. I will not buy any of this series unless they re-release them with the proper languages."
1,Where is the revised english audio track they promised?,"Funimation said they would go back and make revised english audio tracks for the box sets, but after episode 67 in this season 2 box they just recycle and reuse the same cheesy english audio track they recorded back when they first picked up the series, and just set it to the original japanese music. Funimation obviously only made revised english audio tracks for the episodes that were dubbed and aired on TV before the company picked up the series."
2,Sadly Missing Episode Guide Booklet,"I am a huge fan of Dragon Ball Z. I have been satisfied with the Funimation remastered DVDs for years now. However, I am very upset because with the fact that my order of Dragon Ball Z Season 1 and Dragon Ball Z Season 2 from Amazon did not arrive with their episode guide booklets. When I have purchased these remastered sets in the past from other retailers, I have received an episode guide booklet. I am disappointed with Amazon for not including these in my order. They can be very helpful to those who are deeply into the Dragon Ball Z series just as I am. To conclude, don't buy this product thinking that it will come in a COMPLETE set."
5,Good box set,"I wanted to get all the big yellow ""Dragon Box"" sets, but apparently, seasons 1 and 2 are so rare now, I had to get the normal boxed set. The difference wasn't noticeable, other than the fact that it doesn't come with the cool book the yellow Dragon Box sets come with. For the price, you can't beat buying this one!!!"
2,"Not perfect, to say the least!","There was a time I ordered a lot of these Dragon Ball Z sets, wanting to watch with ONLY Japanese audio. This was a preference, and with the intention to immerse in Japanese because I'm trying to learn Japanese. I was off to a good start, but really, the show has always been just okay to me, better with Japanese dialogue. Gave it a shot for the preference. In the end just not too impressed. Near the end of this box in the set, it seemed the better choice to be done with it. So I got rid of them, instead of getting sets 5 and 6 I was considering. They are gone, and the last thought I would give DBZ is this review.Full of filler, I got the original full DBZ because there were some scenes worth keeping (longer fights, and Goku training in space) but the positive points could not save this show. If only there were a few changes I might have liked Dragon ball Kai. In this case, okay sometimes is not quite enough."
4,"I knew it wasn't the big one, but I was expecting more",This season was again a cliff hanger. It ends when Ginyu is turned into a frog. Now I'm thinking that the whole season 3 will be about 1 fight (Freeza). I would still buy it because otherwise you are skiping a big gap in the series. Not much to say for this one.
1,Rip Off,It was advertised as new but i recieved it used and to top it off i got season twos discs in a season nine box wtf
5,Great,"This season was in prime condition, worked great. Would be willing to by from this seller in future."
4,exeptional service,recieved item quickly through mail came in perfect quality will do bussiness with amazon again
3,More filler less thriller...,The Dragonball Z series is excellent but this season was just a filler with character introduction and lead up to the Super Sayian transformation.
3,"Duran Duran finding themselves again, 3 1/2 stars","I view this album largely as a transitional album for the boys. They just added two new members (well, unofficially they'd been working together for a while) and set out to follow up what was a reasonable successful album. While I personally would classify Liberty as their worst album, I have to say that two of my all-time favorite DD songs came out of this album, 'My Antarctica' and 'Downtown', the latter of which is about as close to old-school Duran Duran style (circa 1983) as any of their newer stuff. 'Serious', 'Venice Drowning', and that Water song are also pretty good, but the rest is a wash of pop blather, and not worth listening to. Would I buy the album again? You bet. The songs that are good far outweigh the negatives, and for those fans of Astronaut and Pop Trash who haven't heard this album, I think you should take another look."
1,useless,After receiving I quickly realized it's a useless rack. It needs to be modified before it can be used and thus sits in a box somewhere.
1,"Seriously, UGH","I agree with the others who were critical of this awful book. I too hoped it would be a good cozy, with thoughtful characters and a decent mystery. I ended up skimming to the end, just to see which horrible person was the killer (and you could take your pick, I didn't like any of the characters). At the ending I rolled my eyes and then threw the book in the trash. I love books, and have never, ever thrown one away. I wouldn't even pass this so-called mystery on to anyone else to read. There are so many great authors, don't waste your time on this one. In addition to the other authors mentioned to read instead-- please read Dana Stabenow, J S Borthwick, Jan Burke, Nevada Barr, Jerrilyn Farmer, Paula Gosling, Sarah Graves, Charlaine Harris, Carolyn Haines, Joan Hess, Jill Churchill (and I think Churchill was mentioned-- it bears repeating). And so many more--"
4,Great book for dieters,"OK, I have read both the good and the bad reviews, and I am somewhere in between. I am a Weight Watchers member, so that aspect made the book more interesting to me, because I understood the struggles, joys, jokes and tears of the members of the Weight Winners circle. The WW parts made the book more enjoyable for me. That said, my first impression upon reading it was that it was not written by a professional author. (I was surprised to see Dietz had other novels out there.) Some characters were pretty stereotypical, and the dialogue was sometimes too rapid fire between the Ellie and Peter. It seemed like it would have fit in with a 1940s sexual tension film noir flick, but I didn't think it worked that way in print. However....I did enjoy this book, probably more so that the average reader because of my WW experience."
2,Dissapointed in Quality,"At the original advertised price of these hand towels, I thought I was getting a super great hand towel at a good price (50% off). I was very disappointed in the thickness of the towel. I thought they would be very plush. The color is very nice, however."
1,don't buy black towels,"These black towels are awful. I've washed them 4 times and every time I use them to dry off, black fuzz gets all over me. Definately won't buy them again."
4,The perfect bath towel,"These bath towels are great. They have maintained their color even after several washes. Before the first wash, I did soak them in a tub of cold water with about 1/4 cup of vinegar -- a little trick my mom taught me."
3,Egyptian Cotton Towel Bath,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017107S6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleWasn't exactly what I expected this towel to be. Bought similar product for $4:00 in store. Not worth the extra shipping charge or the higher price.
1,Martex Egyptian Wash Cloth,"Very poor quality! The material is very thin and even after multiple washing, the fabric continues to ""bleed"" every time it's used."
4,nice towels,"The color of these towels is exactly what I was expecting, and the color has not faded after multiple washings. The absorbancy isn't the greatest, but I've noticed that with use and after a few washings, they have become more absorbant.For the price, definitely a good buy."
4,"Great price, nice towels","While I wouldn't describe these towels as ""luxury"", they are very nice and thick. The downside is the size- just a little too small."
3,Martex Egyptian Blue towels,"These are OK cheap towels if you got a good deal on them. They do not really absorb water that well, and they tend to get frayed after a few washes. However they are useable and good for single guys or college students. Good rich dark Navy color and they have a nice hefty feel."
5,Buying Towels Online,"This is the second or third time I have purchased linens on line from Amazon. When I receive the merchandise it is always as expected. Although I have to pay shipping, for me it is a convenience expense. I live an hour away from a shopping center, have an intense work schedule allowing little time for shopping in a conventional way. This is a terrific way for me to buy what I want, get the quality I expect, and make the best use of my time."
2,Fair quality at best,Not nearly as thick as I would expect for the price. Can find better quality at lower prices in department stores when on sale.
3,So So Towels,"I was not impressed with these towels. The are the standard, middle of the road towels. I returned these towels and bought 4 sets of the Deal of the Day towels - that are awesome"
3,Nothing Special,"These towels are OK for the price, but far short of good quality. They feel light and my feeling is they look slightly on the small side but to be honest I havn't compared them. Needed several washes before they finally stopped leaving little balls of fluff all over you when you dried yourself."
1,"Before I get it, it was lost in the front of my door","Before I get it, it was lost in the front of my door"
3,"OK, But Nothing Outstanding","I bought several of the 2 packs. They are very functional but not fancy. They're good for everyday use. They are not as soft and thick as more expensive cloths, and they don't have a fancy border. I wouldn't put them in the guest bath for important visitors, but I have no problem using them myself."
1,Bad towels,"We bought 4 of these towels. Within 8 months the seams had gone on 3 of the 4 and they were unravelling. That's just unacceptable. Also, despite numerous washing the cotton hasn't softened appreciably. Do yourself a favor and pass these up."
2,Buyer beware!,I agree with the previous reviewers. This is not a bath sheet; it is a towel. I did not check the dimensions before I ordered. The color is true to the picture. It's OK as a towel - a little light weight. I thouhgt I had ordered something larger.
3,"Not a Bath ""Sheet""","I searched for ""Bath Sheets"" and I was so excited to find bath sheets for less than $15 each!I should have known it was too good to be true.These are actually slightly longer bath towels. There isn't much ""overlap"" in the front.So whoever put ""Bath Sheet"" in the tags is incorrect.My ring got caught on one the first day and they pull very easily.Not sure of the quality after a few washings.""Martex 100% Egyptian Cotton Loops Bath Sheet, Burgundy "" is the description for these and it is wrong!A bath sheet is: 39""x68"" FYI"
1,First Thing I have been sorry I bought from Amazon,Martex Egyptian cotton sheets were not what I had expected. They were not the size that cotton sheet towels usually are and they were poorly made. I have had a set of Martex sheet towels for years so when I saw them on Amazon I ordered a set. There is no comparison to the new towels and the ones I already own. Usually Amazon has good products but this is not one of them.
1,Lasted a couple of months,"Already regretting buying these. Bought 3 sets and all are starting to come apart along the sides. I've never had towels wear like this...I usually just get tired of them after a few years and toss. These are coming apart at the sides--a sign of poor manufacturing. Egyptian, in this case, means poorly made in a sweat shop. Do not buy! Note: This is my first review of a product from Amazon. I have purchased many items but never felt like I needed to review until now. Buyer beware."
3,Egyptian towel,"Beautiful color.But not much softer then regular towels.I was disappointed,because I thought it would be softer and thicker."
3,GFord,"I havent even used the towels yet, washed once, dryer trap was thick, and after i got done folding, there was almost enough fuzz on the bed to make a wash cloth...On a nicer note, they do feel soft..."
5,Mes Courants Electriques,This is one of Alizee better Cd's she is showing how much she has grown with her work
5,Perfect Follow-up,"Mes Courants Electriques is the perfect follow-up to Alizee's debut album, Gourmandises. Once again written and produced by Mylene Farmer, this album continues where Gourmandises left off. It offers the same delectable lush synth construction with a dark side. From sensuous and passionate to defiant to playful, the impeccable composition evokes deep feelings. Also contains some distinctively mediterannean rhythms that contribute to Alizee's sound."
1,Mes Courants Electriques Bonus Vcd Compatibility,"Excellent. However, don't expect the bonus VCD to play on your DVD player--even those that handle most VCDs and MPEGs--you will probably just get audio. The video does play on a computer with Windows Media Player."
3,"Decent follow-up to the excellent ""Gourmandises""","Someone has to do the dirty job and tell that this second offering by the French former lolita is not as good as her debut. Yes, ""J'en Ai Marre"" may be very nice but it was never going to cause the sensation that ""Moi..Lolita"" did. The rest of the album is decent enough but whereas Gourmandises had diverse rhythms/influences, ""Mes Courants Electriques"" sounds a bit too flat by comparison, as if everything was arranged on the same mid-tempo rhythm. Nevertheless, there are good enough moments there, such as the moody ""A Contre-courant"", ""J'ai Pas Vingt Ans"", and ""Tempete"" (where Alizee does a ""Parler Tout Bas"" but it comes out as somewhat inferior). A nice album overall but it could have been so much better.The album deserves 3 1/2 stars but no way 4, so I'll settle for 3 :)"

1,Royal Dumble 1993,This is one of the worst PPV shows of 1993 and maybe even all of the 1990's. The only GOOD matches were HBK-Marty Jannetty match even with the disappointing ending and the world championship bout between Bret Hart & Razor Ramon(Scott Hall) which was surprisingly good. The WORST matches were the Steiner Bros-Beverly Bros tag bout which was boring and the Big Boss Man-Bam Bam Bigelow fight which was a dud. The Royal Rumble match was and maybe still is trash with Giant Gonzalez's debut in this bout making it worse. I give this event a 2 out of 10.
2,Royal Rumble 1993!!,This PPV put Razor Ramon on the map as a wrestler. The Royal Rumble itself was horrible and Yokozuna was a bad choice for a winner.Bret Hart vs. Razor Ramon for the World Title. This was a very good match and Razor Ramon put on a great show but in the end Bret retained the title. (3.5/5)Shawn Michaels vs. Marty Jannetty for the IC Title. This was the best match of the night and everybody knew that HBK was gonna retain his IC Title. (4/5)Steiner Brothers vs. Beverly Brothers was very slow and boring and not very good action at all. The Steiner Brothers win. (1.5/5)Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Big Boss Man was a pretty bad excuse for a match. Bam Bam Bigelow returns and beats Big Boss Man. (0.5/5)Royal Rumble Match was a boring Rumble because all the guys were to far away in the numbers. Why did they have to have Yokozuna win? (1.5/5)Overall this PPV was just bad like the 1992 Rumble. Don't pick up this PPV at all but you should at least rent it.
1,omissions,I bought an electri pac with 35 amp fuse which blew and noneof the auto shops or hardware stores have 35 ampfuses. This is not good!!
4,The beauty of the Erhu...,"Lovely album, the pieces are a very good representation of the best to be found in erhu music. I especially recommend Sunshine on Tashkurgan, there's a certain Mongolian flavour to it, very exotic... All the pieces are quite technically demanding, yet displaying the erhu's beautiful tone to the greatest advantage. From the popular Erquan and Galloping Horses (Zhan4 Ma3 Ben1 Chi2 in Chinese) to the rarer Sunshine, this CD covers a rich spectrum in the erhu repertoire. A great buy!"
3,Good product,This CD was purchased as a gift so have not listened to it myself. Will not be able to provide more info until I receive feedback from person it is for. Looks great though
5,"Great Novel about Love, Friendship and Honesty","All I can say is WOW! This book is GREAT! I enjoyed every page. If it wasn't for my wifely and motherly duties I would have been finished in a day. I have to admit at first I thought this was going to be about a man having an affair with three different women, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thank Joel McIver for giving us a positive, honest, strong, loving black man to read about. I know it's fiction, but it seemed so real. All of the characters and their individual story lines were well defined. You're drawn in from the first page. Excellent novel."
2,Underwhelming.,"If, like me, you're a fan of Roy Stuart, Jan Saudek, Newton, Mapplethorpe, etc, you might naturally be drawn to this book. However, the photography here is pretty uninspired, the models (perhaps six in all) aren't particularly beautiful or interesting, nor are they doing anything interesting. It's more like a guy with a camera taking stock black and white photos for High Society or Genesis, circa 1984. Pretty boring. The book ""Naked In Apartment 7,"" by Peter Gorman was FAR more engaging, with interesting-looking women, doing interesting things, in interesting places."
5,Don't be scared by the cover!,"After trying the unbelievably bland ""Healthy Cooking for Two"" and so many other ""cooking for two"" cookbooks (many on which were written in the 80's) and being thoroughly dissapointed, I cam across this gem. These recipes go far beyond the ""take two skinless boneless chicken breasts, bake, serve with cornstarch/orange juice reduction"" type recipes which haunt other cooking for two books. Those books often get the ""quick, easy, for two"" part right, but leave your taste buds crying.This book, on the other hand, is a godsend. Right from the first soup (an asian soup in which they actually take the time to flavor the broth with lemon grass, carrrots, chile flakes and lime juice before straining) I knew I had found a book that is for those of us who love food.One thing: don't be scared by the cover! Hardly visually appealing, and the only thing wrong with this otherwise incredible cookbook."
4,Good Stuff,It protects you from the harsh sun but make sure you use a little bit because more than a dab will make your face really oily.
2,"Not a mechanical switch keyboard, like I thought.","I thought all Cherry keyboards were real buckling spring mechanical keyboards, so I got one. No, It's a run of the mill, slightly better than others, membrane switch keyboard. So I still have it in the box, and will let my kid use it if he wants it. I went and got a couple of original IBM Model M keyboards, and am happy as a clam. That is what is grinding out this review. The real deal. Nice and clicky, not mushy, like membrane switches."
1,Broke and Oreck won't fix it,This little vacuum broke after a year or two. It still looks like brand new but won't even turn on. Oreck does not fix it unless you saved your receipt.
1,Not a good vacuum,"Poorly designed, cumbersome, difficult to carry around (even using the strap) and poor suction. I got this as a ""freebie"" when I bought an Oreck upright, which is an adequate vacuum. Like another reviewer said, Oreck should nix the ""freebies"" and just make their regular vacuums cheaper. This thing cannot even pick up lint and pet hair. I don't know how it ever supposedly picked up a bowling ball."
1,Money pit!,"I received one of these canister vacuum cleaners when I purchased an Oreck upright. I also purchased one to aid in cleaning multiple floors of my new home. I have now had to replace each hose 2x that's four in 5 years), the cords 1x each and multiple brushes. Truly a bad purchase."
4,I expected something different,"I am prejudiced about the children's literature scholar, Kimberley Reynolds, therefore this book was dissapointing, because she wrote only the introduction (that, by the way, is the best part of the book!)The book consists of three essays - quite interesting - and a short bibliography. Scholarly written, therefore I rate it 4 stars. Thanks!"
4,Great Buy,These headphones are great. They have excellent sound quality and are reasonably priced. I advise buying it.
5,"Well Designed, Less Pain - Recommended!","The ""Ascensia Microlet Lancing Device"" is well made and allows for almost painless testing of blood sugar (when used in conjunction with Ascensia MICROLET Lancets - 25 gauge - Box of 100) and almost any test meter (I recommend Ascensia CONTOUR Monitoring System).The Lancing Device has a depth gauge that needs to be set for your personal needs and comfort to get the proper blood sample size. Once you find the minimum depth that works well for you, most of the future testing should be mostly painless.Recommended!"
4,"The History Behind ""Last of the Mohicans""","James Fenimore Cooper's ""Last of the Mohicans"" is a fun read, and the 1992 Mann movie by the same name is one of my favorites.This historical narrative brought to life some of the actual historic events which figured in Cooper's tale. The focus on actual events and persons gives the documentary a visceral sense of reality. It also alludes to how close America came to loosing George Washington!The production values, though not cinematic, are above-average.If you are a student of Colonial history and a lover of beautiful films, I would highly recommend seeing this documentary then watching ""Last of the Mohicans"". The history will give the drama more sense of reality and place."
4,"Peggie... ""tanglewood""","I had to listen to this CD several times to really appreciate it. I was first a bit dissapointed but then ...the WOW"" factor kicked in when I realized the dynamics and theatrics of each song. I loved..LOVED the fading of his voice into the loudness of instruments playing ""February Song"". he creates a visual of him fading into the crazy world of a musical artist and how he was feeling. And again he takes you on a journey in ""So She Dances"". just listen to the dynamics within the song..he closes his eyes and invisions dancing in the spotlight with this beautiful lady. You hear a muffled hush with a slight wind blowing and the orchestration fades... just sooooo wonderful. Note on each of his songs how the music compliments his story telling through song.You know I have also met him and spent enough time to see the sincerity in his life... bravo Josh, Bravo... Yur Bonnie, Peggie Lee"
4,Awake - Josh Groban,"This is a very good CD by Mr. Groban, whose voice I have admired for many years. He does a fantastic job, and the songs are good, though I personally prefer a couple of his other CD's. I look forward to hearing his newest CD, ""All That Echoes."""
4,Groban a favorite,Absolutely love his music. He is a joy to listen to and has the voice of an angel. You can help but love his music.
3,His voice is still brilliant but the song selection.......,"I eagerly awaited his new CD and bought it because I love Josh. I listened to it one time and had no desire to listen to it again. :( The classical feel is gone from this album and it seemed like Josh wasn't quite sure where he wanted to go with this CD.There are couple of songs I adore but the entire album doesn't seem to ""flow"". Still - it is Josh singing. Can't go wrong there."
3,Find your place Josh!,"Josh started with great stage sound. You fall in love with his voice. He's tested his classical, but this, Awake, has no continunity. He bounces from one style to another. It's painful to listen. Who or what is leading him up and down and all over. Hope he finds his vocal comfort zone soon. I won't buy another of his CD until I hear he has. This music doesn't do the best for his voice at all!"
3,Please don't waste that wonderful voice on pop music...,"I like the first part of this album, but not the latter part. Pop singers are a dime-a-dozen, Josh has honest vocal talent that shouldn't be wasted on that venue. I hope his next album does away with the pop and sticks to letting us hear that wonderful voice of his. I can listen to a catchy beat on any radio station. I listen to Josh to hear his beautiful voice (even if I don't understand a word of Italian! LOL)."
3,"Not one of his best, but who can resist Josh?","I will buy any Josh Groban CD without hearing even one note first, and this album did not change my mind about that. However, it's probably my least favorite of his albums. His voice is beautiful, as always, but I found the album a bit bland. As often happens with CDs, I grew to like it more the more I listened to it, and found some definite favorites in ""Machine"" and ""February Song,"" but it will never become as special to me as his others.But don't let my lackluster review sway you. If you love Josh Groban, you'll love this CD. It's a must have for your collection."
2,Please Awaken Josh Groban!,"Awake is simply put quite dreadful. It consists of that insipid Euro-Trash Pop Fusion music so popular in Denmark and Las Vegas. The pity is Josh Groban has a great voice that he is wasting on this sort of crap. Just listen to the fullness of his voice on his two cuts from the Barbara Cook At the Met album and compare them to the watered-down, lost in an echo-chamber crooning he does here. Unless you're a die-hard fan, I's avoid this album entirely."
5,WONDERFUL,Thank you Amazon- I got it in 1 day with my prime 2 day delivery. I ordered 4 (1 for me and 1 for my car and 2 for friends). It is so beautiful that I can't stop listening. It almost makes you cry. Order it and you will love it.
5,Josh is growing as a singer,"I agree I dont love this whole album yet, but the more I listen to it, the more songs I just love. Josh is growing as a singer, and his voice is unreal as he can sing anything and sound great, go JOSH. I did see Josh in concert and nothing beats that performance!"
3,Disappointed in Josh's progress,"I purchased one of Josh's early albums (""Josh Groban"")...maybe his first? I was excited when I purchased his highly-rated ""Awake"" album to witness what I hoped would be a growth experience for Josh. The first album I listened to was one of my favorites, and I told my husband, ""Let's watch this kid grow as he has life experiences to strengthen his artistic delivery."" I was so disappointed to find no growth whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, the kid has SUCH talent, but I don't find the ""life experience"" addition in his delivery."
1,Condition/Delivery Time = Excellent; CD content disappointing,"Condition of CD excellent; Delivery was timely. I ordered CD because I adore Groban's first CD, play it nearly every day -- for past couple of years, now. THIS CD, however, was EXTREMELY disappointing. I forced myself to listen to entire CD a second time through. I knew I would never play it again -- all the songs sounded alike to me -- so I gave it to a friend."
5,"Awake, Josh Groban","This man has the best voice. He sings popular songs and opera. What can one say more, than he is the finest young singer today"
5,Utterly Magnificent,This album is superb. I have seen this man live. He barely opens his mouth and the most wonderful sounds in the world come out. The same is true for his CDs. I am very pleased.
4,Josh Groban - Awake,"If you like Josh Groban's first two CDs, you will like this one too. My favorite songs are tracks 6 & 10."
2,HUGE Groban fan and HUGELY disappointed,"I adore Josh Groban's vocal passion and have about worn his first two CDs out from playing them over and over and over again. So, of course, I impatiently awaited the new release. I am so sorely disappointed in Awake I could cry. Only in a few of his songs do you find the Groban soul stirring, uplifting passion....the others fall so flat it pains me to listen to them. Sadly, it will probably be another three years before the next release and I won't be looking forward to it with the same ""night before Christmas"" anticipation as I did for Awake. So sorry, Josh. I REALLY wanted to love it!"
4,Beautiful music!,"This is some great music! The song ""You are loved"" it is absolutely amazing, great Christian song."
2,Not the best!,"I really liked Josh Groban's first CD and Closer, but I find the new CD kinda boring. His voice is magnificant, no doubt about that. A voice like Josh groban is rare indeed and someone like this only comes around once in a blue moon. But these choice of songs and arrangements dont do him full justice. Yes, there are a few nice ballads on the CD, but overall it falls short of his previous efforts and certaintly his potential if he had some great songs and slightly better production on the CD!"
5,AWAKE up people and enjoy the JOSH!,"I can't understand the mediocre (even poor) reviews for this CD. Open your minds to the true creative genius that went into this work of art, not to mention one of the greatest natural voices of our age! I truly appreciate the fresh direction that Josh has taken with this new CD and think it's his greatest work yet! Keep up the good work, Josh! You are truly one of a kind and I encourage you to keep evolving!!"
3,"Good, not great.","Josh Groban definitely has one the best voices around. However, I was disappointed in his latest release, Awake. I didn't think the selections were as good as on his previous CD's. I really wish he would stop recording so many songs in other languages and wish he would record an album of classic, familiar songs. But I sure hope he keeps singing!"
3,Groban's Newest Album,"I'm a big Josh Groban fan and I had been waiting impatiently for his newest album. I hadn't really read anything about it before I bought it, so I was expecting something more along the lines of his first two albums (which I love, especial ""Closer""). The first time I listened to Awake (not under the best circumstances), I was disappointed. However, after listening to it two more times so far, I'm getting to like it more and more. I hope anyone who was initially disappointed will take the time to listen a few more times before deciding on it's ""value."" My rating probably started at 1-2 stars, but is increasing - it might even get to 5!"
2,Disappointed,Josh Groban is great no matter what he is singing. I am disappointed by the choice of songs on this CD.
4,Review of Josh Groban.s Awake,This was a gift to my grand daughter. She loves it and we are satisfied with the order and delivery.
3,Review Of the Awake CD,"It is more of my fault than the product. I did not look careful enough of the song list. I thought I will find the song ""Awake"" in the ""Awake CD"". Am I wrong? Make sure you check you song list when you buy a CD."
5,Amazing voice,Arrived ahead of schedule and in great condition. i bought this for my wife and she loves everything about it.
2,Disappointing,"Love Josh Groban's voice, but the selection of tuneless renditions resulted in my fast forwarding most of the CD. Really wish he would stop experimenting and record some tuneful standards."
2,Josh Groban disappoints.,"A very disappointing offering from Josh Groban. I enjoyed his first two CD's very much, but this one made me sorry that I did ordered it based upon the ones I already have."
3,undecided,"I LOVE Gosh, but this album is a bit strange for me. He seems to be all over the place with this one. The voice is the same, but there seems to be a strange grouping of songs. I still love him and will continue to buy his albums but this would not rate as one of my favorites. I LOVE his other albums and have three of each, one for each home and one for my car so I don't have to worry about taking him along."
4,Good but Not Magical,"Josh Groban possesses a rare vocal richness, and this CD showcases that as does all his music. Yet this one largely lacks that ""je ne sais quoi"" of his first recording. The musical genius is all there, but something of the way his music can pierce the soul is missing.""February Song"" and ""Un Giorno Per Noi"" touch that magic, but ""Weeping"" and ""Machine"" seem experimental misfits to this type of recording, a style that certainly Groban is capable of producing, but better on a separate release.Despite the lack of ""magic,"" Josh Groban is one of the most gifted vocalists of our time, and any recording he makes is necessarily good music. 4 stars."
4,Love Josh,Josh Groban has a voice for the ages. This CD really showcases his variety of talents with sweeping instrumentals and emotive vocals. A lovely CD I throughly enjoy listenting to.
5,Josh Groban Awake CD is best yet!,I really enjoy Josh Groban's music. Although before it was more classical and opra-ish I still liked but now this cd is a lot more contemporary. It doesn't hurt to go onto something like iTunes to at least try and listen if you're not sold on it yet. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
5,A New Sound for Josh,"I loved this CD It is fresh and appealing. He is so very talented and with his amazing voice, he can sing any kind of song. One of the best he has done., Thanks, Josh"
3,Doesn't even come close,"to his Closer cd.I, like another reviewer, tried to like it but anybody can sing this CD, not so with his last CD. I am sorry I bought it. I'm also sorry to see him go, but he is headed in another direction than what made him famous. It seems that's what always happens. LeAnn Rimes did the same thing, in my opinion.The Closer CD, was heaven. No other words to describe it. This one, I didn't like one song, enough to listen to it again. The other one, I listened to it every day for months.Very sad Josh Groban fan.I wish everyone would critique his album and not just give the CD five stars because it's Josh Groban and he has a beautiful voice, otherwise he will continue to produce so-so songs."
2,Disappointing!,"I purchased this CD as a gift for my Mom who is a huge Groban fan, but she said this was one of his worst! She was disappointed, saying that it hardly sounded like the Josh Groban she listens to! Now I'm skeptical about purchasing any other CD's of his."
2,Awake - Josh Groban,I loved his first two CDs but was disappointed in this one. It's quite a departure from the style that made him successful. None of the songs are ones I wanted to listen to over and over again. Nice attempt at creativity but it doesn't fly.
2,Disappointing,"I wasn't aware of the type of music Josh would be singing on this. I should have done my homework, before purchasing."
2,Disappointed,"After waiting a very long time for this release, and having great expectations over the music which would be represented, I found it to be a disappointment. Too many varieties of music on one CD - it didn't flow and frankly, I'm not even listening to it now. My friends also felt it wasn't as good as previous work - too mixed up - and too many high notes. Sorry to say this as he's a tremendous talent."
5,Great CD,I am a HUGE Josh Groban fan and this CD does not disappoint. It has somewhat of a new sound in comparison to his other CDs but it is wonderful! I give it 10 stars!
3,Selections prove boring,Well perhaps I'm not a die hard fan of Josh Groban after all. I found his voice marvelous as usual and the orchestration sublime. But the selections are boring in that as a whole they are too much the same. I don't think his full talents shine on this one.
3,Different isn't always better,"Not sure what's going on here, but this is the second straight subpar effort put forth by Josh Groban. His Live at the Greek CD/DVD was a far cry from everything he had put out previously, and this album, while sprinkled with a few choice cuts, simply lacks that magical concoction (music and voice) that was at the forefront of both his self-titled debut as well as Closer.Please don't misunderstand...I think he is brilliant and there is some really good stuff here (February Song and La Ultima Notte in particular), but I am generally disappointed with the overall product and have to question the direction his career is headed. We shall see."
1,Josh is terriffic ...,... but this album was extremely disappointing.I keep wondering why he didn't put out a Christmas album instead? I'm sure it would go platinum overnight.
3,Very Different,"I just purchased AWAKE, and was very disappointed in the choice of music. Josh is a favorite of mine, his voice, range are superior. The first two CDs had some great songs on them. I will listen to it again. However, it was a huge let down from the prior ones. Josh you can do much better, do not let the producers or anyone change your style. It is the style that makes you unique. This just does not cut it. Great voice, poor songs."
2,This album is so dull...,"Well, to be honest, the songs of this album, Awake, are really tasteless. Josh undoubtedly has a wonderful voice. His first album has showed his talent in singing. His second album, Closer, is not as good as his first, but still has some interesting songs. Unfortunately, this album, Awake, has a lot of boring songs which simply try to imitate each other and do not fit at all with Josh's powerful and heavenly voice. After listening to this album several times, I couldn't find any reason why I should play this CD again. I sincerely hope that people can write really good songs such as ""You're Still You"" and ""To Where You Are"" for him in the next album. Please!"
5,A winner,"This album is a real winner. I have listened to it many times and I'm still finding new things to love about this talented young singer. He's inspired. I don't have a favorite song on this CD because my favorite changes with my mood. Where did that voice come from?? And not just the voice, the music gives me goosebumps."
3,"Ok, but....","This album was ok, but definately not as good as his previous ones. Definately the weakest cd of the bunch. I'm hoping for a rebound on his next effort."
5,Another star-performance from Groban!,"As always, the performances are wonderful, selections great and his orchestra outstanding."
5,Josh Rocks in this album,I would have to say this is his best album. the best song on this cd is probably You are Loved. he does an awesome job on it and it is the most sensational song i have ever heard in my life. i'm getting this cd in 3 weeks. this is a must!
3,Josh Needs a new vocal coach.,"I saw Josh on Jay Leno tonight and had to see if his performance was a one-off or a pattern. Unfortunately, he sounds as if his tongue is halfway down his throat on this album. I compared his albums side-by-side, and his tone has definitely changed for the worse. If this was an attempt to ""mature"" his sound, it has sorely missed its mark.That said, Groban's voice is still a marvelous instrument, and if you are not picky about tone, it's a nice album, I suppose. I won't be buying it. I can only hope someone close to him will warn him before this guy does some real damage."
3,"Awake, Okay but......","While Awake does again feature Josh Groban's wonderful voice, the songs just don't grab me. Unlike his previous albums that each had a couple of songs that you just can't forget, this album is just kind of there. Nothing special, just sort of nice background music."
4,Josh Groban,If you are a fan of his 1st and 2nd album this seems more commercial and geared towards a pop audience. My favorite was 1st album 2nd is ok Live At The Greek is a great cd/dvd to have but this album is ok I'm sure i will play it once in a while
2,Poor song selection,"I own Groban's first two albums and really like them, but this album leaves me cold. The song selection doesn't show off his vocal talent; many of the songs are bland, with childish or poor lyrics. His Spanish pronunciation is a bit off in this one, too. As other reviewers have mentioned, the passion of his previous music is simply gone. What happened, Josh?The only songs in this new style that hold a hint of interest are ""In Her Eyes"" and ""Now Or Never"" (written by the talented Imogen Heap). I'm wishing I hadn't paid full price for two good songs. Word of advice: Even if you like Groban, check this one out from the library or borrow a copy. Listen to the full CD BEFORE you buy."
4,Awake,I am always surprised that Groban's voice is as good as I think that it is. The selections are good and worth listening to again and again. Share it with others.
3,I'm Disappointed,"I think it would be more suitable to call this an ""instrumental"" album since the instrumental ""accompanyment so overpowers the vocals. There are very few memorable or ""hummable"" songs. I love Josh Groban's voice - I'd like to hear it, and be able to understand the lyrics, on an album with his name on it."
5,Wonderful CD - 5 Stars,"Thought-provoking and powerful music. Heard an interview with him on a local radio talk show recently and thought he was funny, so went out and bought the CD. I have not purchased his other CD's, if this one sounds different, than different is better. Best cuts are 'February Song' and 'Weeping' with a South African ensemble- I love this song- crank up the stereo and hear the clear voice. Not crazy about Track 13 Machine.What a talented person, great to see him branch out. This man is going to go far. Pick up copies of this as GIFTS.Great job Josh!"
2,Third is NOT the charm,"Josh has an amazing voice, and as a long-time fan I am sad to say this album is a far cry from the first two. A very different choice of songs that appears generic and is lacking his usual passion. And what is up with the lullaby? What saves this CD are the very good italian songs, oozing with passion and Josh's usual refinement. Bottomline: if you're not into poppy Josh, don't buy this CD, or if you do, get the extended version with ""Verita"" another very good italian song."
3,Good but not great,"After two spectacular prior album releases, this was just ok for me. I'm a big Josh Groban fan and find myself migrating back to his first two albums: Josh Groban (2001) and Closer (2003). Call me old school. I do prefer, however, Awake over Illuminations (2010).I'm anxiously awaiting the upcoming release of his next album: ""All That Echoes"" (to be released February 5, 2013) and hope it will revert again from just good...to great.."
5,Album,Josh groban album Awake is a great album. Is great to see a new recording in vinyl and enjoy it on a turntable.
3,"Not my favorite, but nice.","Josh has a smooth, mellow sound, but this is not my favorite collection of songs. If you are a die-hard fan you should enjoy this CD though."
3,Boring Bochelli clon,"State of American pop is so bad that even this pedestrian music for masses gets a lot of cheers. I need to give Josh a credit for managing to overcome lack of upper notes in his voice and producing a sound that can be enjoyable. Not in case of this album, though, because of the rather poor music material."
4,I'm liking it better with time,"My first impression of this album was that it was not as good as the previous. I found a couple of the cuts to be 'dark and depressed' and others to be a bit too 'preachy'. But there are some great pieces on the album as well. It is unfortunate that he did not include the title cut ""Awake"" on this CD. It is absolutely beautiful and, in my opinion, should have been released before ""February Song"".I have all of his albums and I have seen him in concert 4 times, the most recent being April 7th in Las Vegas. As I've come to listen to this album and understand the stories behind the songs, I have come to appreciate it more. I do like the tempo changes and the challenge to reach out to different styles of music. I think this is the Josh of the future as he continues to expand into different genres of music. I just hope he sticks to his roots and doesn't reach too far."
1,"Some like it, I don't","I just don't get this music. For some reason I keep thinking I should like it and I have tried, but I have to force myself to listen to it. It's just not for me."
5,Awake,"This CD is so beautiful, he has an incredible voice and I think that this is my favorite CD of his."
4,"Good, if not his greatest","Enjoyable music, wonderful voice. A MUST for the diehard Groban fan, a nice addition to your music sets for those who like his music without putting him on a pedestal."
4,"Two different CD's, maybe even three.","I like Josh. And I like this recording. But it did take some getting used to. The featured radio song, ""You are loved"", sounds better on the CD than what I hear on the radio. Which was awesome. There is a song that reminds me of ""Starry, Starry Night"" if you know that song. I wasn't expecting that, though it isn't bad. And the last three song seem to be Josh breaking away from what he is really good at. They are just okay. I would have thought with Dave Matthews co-writing ""Lullaby"" that I would love it, and it is the one I like best of the last three songs, but it still is just okay. I was very surprised that I didn't like ""Machine"" with Herbie Hancock. Overall, the CD is good. Just be prepared for some surprises."
2,Nothing Special,"Basic filler & fluff. Sales $$$$Boring, uninspiring and tame. Nothing memorable.Only his voice saves an otherwise dissapointing production.As a real fan of his, it was almost painful to listen to."
3,Missing the singable melodies,"If you looked up Josh Groban fan in the dictionary, there my picture would be! I was so looking forward to this CD and even paid the 30.00 dollars to get the special edition cut.I'm sad to say I'm disappointed. Aside from a few songs, I thought the rest were mainly dark, depressing and all sounded a lot alike. I miss the singable melodies (David Foster's stronger influence on previous CD's?).I would listen to Josh sing the phonebook, but I miss the sounds of previous CD's. My husband has never heard Josh (can you believe it?).So, he came in the room when I had the new CD playing and after a while said, ""Geez, this sounds like music to slit your wrists by.""And,Josh, if you're reading this, I'm so sad you're not coming to Kansas City next year on tour. I thought we did you proud last time you were here! Any chance of changing your mind?"
3,different...,"It's differnet from his other albums, but it isn't awful. I think I could get used to it... but I perfer his old albums."
2,not his best. but good,"I have loved the music of Josh Groban since the beginning. this new album is not his best. the music is lacking the spark. He can do better. after playing this CD over and over. I was wrong. some of the songs are not my favorites, but it is worth it for at least 2 of them. ""you are loved is beautiful and February song"" is hauntingly beautiful. sorry for the first 3 lines!"
1,Wrong product sent,The wrong product was sent and the seller was unable to be contacted. I was very disappointed in the service.
1,waste of time,Josh groban has a beautiful voice.The problem is the music is awful.I really tried to like his new CD. Don't waste your money.
1,What happend to the music?...,"I am giving Josh Groban 5 stars for his voice and 0 stars for his selection of music.Maybe it's not his fault, maybe it's the producer's.We all know that some other artists with a bad voice are trying to sing songs who were sang by great singers. They were just simply killing it. In this case is just the opposite, these horrible songs are killing Josh Groban's voice. The reason why the CD is #1 seller on Amazon, because he has done so well with the previous albums, that people don't read the reviews or listen to the previews.I am waiting for #4 release... I am really curious..."
4,Awake and Alive,"Josh Groban has done it again. His CD, Awake, is full of uplifting and enchanting songs- too many to review individually. He is quoted with saying that ""Closer is a more direct representation"" of who he really is, however, I think Awake fits the bill much better. It has a good balance of the languages, wonderful big band type music, and some great guest artists. Awake is definately worth the time!"
5,"Fabulous, Wonderful, Inspirational, Awesome","Josh Groban really choses songs that show off his magical abilities as a singer. His talents come through with each and every song. Every song seems to tell a story. Every presentation is done with beauty, style, feeling and delight. 5 star CD."
5,Josh Groban,"It just doesn't get much better than this! A beautiful voice, a beautiful young man singing beautiful music. What's not to like? I own all of Groban's CDs and will certainly buy the next one also."
4,"So Far, So good.","Like listeners above, I've listen to this CD 4 or 5 times now and am slowly liking more and more songs. I would have to agree that it is definately a more contemporary sound than his previous releases. More songs for the radio it seems. I absolutely love 'Solo Por Ti', 'Un Giorno Per Nio', 'Lullaby', and 'Weeping'. I'm sure in due time I will enjoy the rest of the songs as well, but my first impression of the albumn is a new age sound that doesn't seem to fit him."
5,Josh Groban - Awake,"This was a grab-bag gift on the job. The young lady who requested it, played it when we had our little party and I was very impressed. I then bought my own copy. Thanks again."
5,Best album EVER!,"I've been a Josh Groban fan for a few years now, and I have loved every single one of his albums. Awake is his best cd yet! Awake is my favorite cd. It is the only one i've been listening to ever since it came out. I have a few friends who used to not like his music, but when they heard his new album they LOVED it and went out to buy a copy of their own. He's outdone himself yet again. He has created a masterpeice."
2,really not a good effort,"I loved Groban's first CD. His second CD was almost as good, but not quite. This one really misses the mark. The songs lack passion. One of the songs sounds like he's got a cold. At least one song is so full of falsetto that he sounds horribly off key. Most of the songs are just boring to listen to because he sounds bored singing them. The title of the CD, ""Awake"" is listed as a ""bonus"" track. How does that make any sense?!? What a contrast from the passion and energy of his first CD."
3,Not like his first 2 CDs...,"I couldn't get into most of the songs on this album. I mean, I can appreciate the songs but I would rank them as just OK or nice. This album did not provide the same impact as his first two CDs. His voice is great but the songs just don't have that perfect blending of lyrics and melody."
2,Good but more of the same,"I think Josh Groban has tremendous talent but his recordings only show us a narrow part of this talent. Pairing with Lady Smith was a good start. Honestly,it's why I bought the CD. FINALLY, a new sound!Now, would they please add some uptempo songs?"
4,Not Dissapointed,I love Josh Grobin but I think his first 2 releases were better--his voice comes across better in his foreign language renditions and his falsetto is not complementory--easy listening--but glad I got a good price--the release price would have not been to my liking for the results.
4,I love it!,"This cd is really good. I like the more contemporary songs he sings. The best songs, I think, are Don't Give Up, which I love because of the emotion he gives to the song, and In Her Eyes. The only song I don't really care for is the last one, Machine."
4,Groban's finally won me over,"There are some wonderful tenors out there and Josh Groban is one of the best but up until AWAKE I found myself easily bored with some of his songs. I'd like to hear a little more skilled rolling of his ""r""s and a softer sound to his ""t""s when singing Italian songs.I am probably the only person in the western hemishpere who didn't like ""You Raise Me Up"" but that song is the reason I never bought the CD.Awake is something else. This just might be the CD to win the rest of us hold-outs over. It's won me over with his versatility, his willingness to take artistic chances, his ability to have some fun with a very serious voice. He's different--he's cool--he's talented. I'm hooked."
3,Josh Groban - Awake,"I was disappointed in this CD. I've loved the others I have (2) by Josh, but this one just didn't seem to 'take me there.' I'm a big fan, but not one of these songs hit my heart. Sorry."
5,Still singing years later,"This is something we had for our daughter (now 14) when she was little, and purchased to have again for our son(now 9) . We still sing some of these songs at each other when trying to make each other smile."
4,Interesting perspective on betting strategy,"I'm just starting to play Texas Hold'em so I got this video along with Howard Lederer's. Between the 2 they have given me some good fundamentals- Lederer has a really good pre-flop strategy (very tight), while Gordon has some good tips on post flop betting strategy and short handed play. After just 2 months of playing in a city-wide poker tournament I make the final table usually 90% of the time, the final 4- 50% and have won or come in the money 5 times. So yeah, this video is worth it."
4,Final table,Final table is a play by play of one of Phil's final tables. It goes through thought processes and decision making. I found it helpful and one of the best poker tutorials out there.
4,"Not bad Phil, Not bad",I am a above average player trying to get an egde on some of my opponents and I learned a few things from this video. Very realistic bad beats and statagies to keep your head in the game. While playing along you are able to get inside Phil's head and chuckle with some of his humor.
2,No es tan bueno,"Tiene todas las funcionalidades que tiene un Creative MuvoTX con el adicional que posee una memoria expansible con una memoria SD, los audífonos son muy pesados y no tienen suficiente calidad para un uso diario, el reproductor resulta un poco grande para llevarlo consigo a diario.Definitivamente hay mejores opciones."
1,doesn't work,I put it because one of the reviews here said the player came with a CD that had the Windows 98 driver. Well it didn't. And the driver at Coby's web site doesn't work. I installed it but Windows reports no driver. Fortunantly I bought it locally and can return it. But I'm agrreivated. Don't lie in reviews.
4,"Batteries, batteries, and more batteries","This is an excellent product, hence the four stars. However, if you want to play it a lot, you must must must invest in batteries galore. The battery life is ridiculously low. The sound quality is nice enough. The earphones are terribly large and will hurt your ears, however, all of the earphones, including the Sony earphones I purchased appear to be large to me."
3,"Good, but only for the basics","I got this for myself for my birthday last year. I bought it for $70 at a store, it was my first mp3 player. It's a cute little gadget, tiny, easy to hold but it feels cheap. This mp3 is only good for people who havent had one already. It's perfect for children because it's so easy to use. It can hold a decent amount of songs but if youre a music pro this is not your machine. You can chage the equalizer, randomize and the recording capabilities are pretty decent. You need better headphones that the ones it comes with though because those dont go too high. Good machine by only for the basics."
1,"Bought one, won't work","The Coby MP-C741 I bought won't work. Sometimes it plays one song o.k., but when it switches to the next song, it always switches to fast forward mode, and then there is no sound. If I fast backward the song, it starts playing, only to start the next song in fast forward mode.Also it has started just freezing up at after 12 minutes ....I'm very disapointed with this product."
1,Too bad it doesn't work,"Cute device. Plugged it into XP computer, found the device, assigned it to drive G. Tried to look at G, said Insert disk for drive G.Technical support line busy. Finally got through, talked to someone for 2 minutes, they put me on hold and then hung up.I am returning it tomorrow."
2,short life time,"after few months it just stopped working.also, it is not rechargable, and need to replace batery every 1-2 weeks"
3,Its Hard being a Pimp,"This movie is okay. Its low budget, but the story line is great! I would rent it first before I buy it. Its based on a true story!"
4,Good movie,"I think Sugar Valentine was a great movie, besides for the fact that was based on a true story, this movie was written in a perfect way so that you would follow it and like it all. Overall I think it was a great movie.*Sponsored Post"
1,"PLAIN AND SIMPLE,BUY THE DIRECTORS VERSION","THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE,THIS MOVIE IS SHOCKING,GORY AND CONTROVERSIAL,I WOULD'NT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE R-RATED VERSION,THE MPAA HAS CUT THIS MOVE TO RIBBONS,I HAVE THE DIRECTORS CUT OF THIS MOVIE,AND LET ME TELL YOU,THAT IF YOU WATCHED THIS VERSION YOU HAVENT SEEN THIS MOVIE,SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE UNCUT VERSION.IF YOU ARE DISSAPIONTED IN THIS DVD,YOU WONT BE WITH THE OTHER VERSION.YOU CAN STILL GET THE DIRECTORS CUT.JUST LOOK AROUND,IT WORTH EVERY PENNY.IF YOU ARE A TRUE HORROR GORE HOUND.I WOULD SAY THERE IS ABOUT 30 MINUTES OF THIS MOVIE THAT HAS BEEN CUT OUT..NOT KIDDING.THIS IS A TRUELY GREAT FLICK.THE R-RATED VERSION IS NOT!!"
2,Bloody but boring,"I bought this movie because it was on a horror movie list called ""Top 40 goriest American movies"". I think it was #17 on the list. Ok first off, if your expecting a Hollywood no budget film with awesome cinematography, this is far from it! Its definitely a B-movie. While the gory is pretty good, the plot is same old serial killer movie but not as good. Acting is not the best, the movie just doesn't entertain you. Now I'm not going to just slam the movie, some parts were good. Its just the bad parts out weight the good parts. The only way I would suggest this movie is if you could watch it for free or find it for a really really cheap price."
1,...WTF?,"No...just.No. I love low budget and amature horror, but there is no excuse for this. I havent seen the unrated version, so mabey after that i'll sing a diffrent song. AVOID LIKE FOX NEWS!"
4,oh the gore!,"even though the acting in this film was completly ridiculous, and it had a horrible story and plot, the gore made up it up for it! i havent laughed so hard in sooo long."
1,"I havent seen the directors cut, but one things for sure..","this version sucks.. there really isnt much to get out of it, the effects are well done when you actually see them. most stuff is off screen and feels extremely watered down. the killer usually just uses a shaving razor which is much better done in Sweeny Todd and House of 1,000 Corpses. the use of a chainsaw is done much better in countless movies, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and TCM: The Beginning to name a couple. the whole ""following a serial killer"" thing is done immensely better in Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer"".... and people say Hostel is watered down..decent camera work and a pretty good soundtrack are the only redeeming qualities this movie has. other than that its just.. lame."
3,Dies quickly,"Maybe it's my phone, but when the battery status is at 'low battery' it dies pretty quickly when you are talking. I drain the battery down as much as possible before i charge it, and it only took a few cycles before it got to the point where i have to charge it every other day (only average about 20-30min of talk & 5 texts per day)."
2,Don't purchase this boombox.,"The only decent feature on this stereo is the CD player, which works OK, as far as load speed and all. But everything else on this machine is ... and poorly made... the tuner recieves 3 different frequencies at one location on the knob, and is useless, because there's no way to isolate just one station. The buttons and knobs are cheap, and ill responsive. The sound is tinny and very poor, unless listening 5 feet directly in front of the speakers. The stereo itself is bulky and unattractive, and takes 6, count'em, 6 D cell batteries to operate,.."
2,Feels and Looks Cheap,"The knobs seem barely attached. The CD controls are awkward and unclear. The sound is - at best - average. For the price, this is a poor deal."
2,bad reception,"It seems nice, for the price... but I feel that the radio's reception is not very good. As you walk closer to it...the station fades out.The cd player tends to stop spinning at times, interrupting the song.Maybe as a gift for a child who doesn't have one, this may be nice, but for an adult that wants quality, I recommend a radio with digital stations instead of the tuner."
4,A fine boombox.... ( for its price....).,This is a nice boombox. Really cheap and the sounds it produces are first class (I listen to classical music and having great sound is a must...). There are of course certain feature missing ( like the timing ) but for this price.... Anyway I would recommended it without any hesitation...
3,A decent boombox....,"The only thing that really lasts the longest is the radio.The CD player lasts a long time,but after a year or 2,it gets so it skips on CDs.The tape player is the most disappointing of all-after 2 months,it starts eating your cassette tapes.I guess they're making cassette players [poorly] these days...."
1,Doesn't Work and little support,"Out of the box, the CD Player didn't work. The manual is absolutely no help, and the customer service center is ""closed for the holiday"" the day AFTER Christmas? Also, the support website... does not exist. Be wary of this product/manufacturer."
1,broke one minute after opening!,"The antennae on the one I received was defective. The mechanism to bend it at the base was so stiff that it could not be moved. When I gently nudged (I'm not exagerating here) the antennae, it snapped off right at the base. In addition, the one I received was not the color pictured here. It was sort of periwinkle blue. What a bummer."
4,"Good, cheap boombox","I was looking for a cheap, reliable boombox that I could put in each Sunday school room at my church. I don't think it has enough bass sound, but for its price, its not bad. The controls are great, but I have noticed that some electronically challenged people try to operate the cd controls with the cassette buttons. That is probably because the cassette controls are closer to the CD door that the CD controls. The pictures on the CD control, a single large button, should probably stand out more. In all, I bought 7 of these boomboxes, and am happy with them all."
5,Good sound quality.,This product has good sound quality. It's easy to operate. At a price of $... you can't go wrong.
1,"Low Price, Low Quality","When I saw the price on this CD player, I thought it was too good to be true. It was. The sound quality is frequently quite poor, especially in the extremes of tenor and bass. As if that wasn't bad enough, it is very unforgiving with respect to tiny dust particles and scratches on your CDs. Almost all my CDs skip frequently using this player, even though NONE of them have ever given me a problem with ANY other player. I have had so many problems with this item that I am now going to have to buy a new boombox...probably a Sony this time. The bottom line: spend a few extra bucks and get a better model!"
3,Meh.,"I think that Dr. Kappas was onto something and I don't deny that the E&P model makes sense to a certain point. However, after reading the book and watching some lectures, I have a feeling that Dr. Kappas started using the E&P theory to rationalize his wandering eye and infidelities. It's no secret that he was divorced several times and couldn't stay faithful in his relationships. The E&P relationship model allowed him to skirt the responsibilities associated with his actions. I think everyone's role shifts depending on the person they're in a relationship with. In my last relationship, I was the E and my boyfriend was the P. In my current relationship, my fiance is the E and I'm the P. I purchased this book and started listening to the lectures because my fiance and I were having some communication problems. Although E&P gave me some insight regarding our relationship dynamics, we were able to work things out ourselves in the end. All in all, I'd say the book was an interesting read."
3,There is more than this book is going into,I bought this book because of a course I was taking. I was disappointed in the used copy I received because it was colored up with crayons from some one's child and you couldn't read placed due to the book damage. I can tell this not as detailed as the course implied that it would be.
3,Something was lost.,"My first impression of ""Borders"" was that the LTJ boys were doing very well at perfecting their pop-punk sound, which they kind of isolated in ""Rockview."" The harmonies and vocalizations in this album are the best LTJ has ever done . . . but something's not there. I can't put my finger on it, but Borders lacks something. One would want to say it's the songs . . . but I really like the songs. I liked the direction that the boys were going with ""Rockview,"" and this is definitely further down that path they selected, but it's just not grabbing me completely. If you're a LTJ fan, you should defineately have this, but try to find it cheap, because it won't stay in your cd player too often."
4,"Dingo's Not So Sour, But Sweet Review","This is a great CD, even though it's not one of LTJ's best. They kind of lost their ska touch, and it doesn't have the same energy as their absolute best CD, Losing Streak. It still has some good songs though, like ""Faction"", ""Is This Thing On?"", and my personal favorite,""Look What Happened."" So go out and bye this CD!! But if you want LTJ at their best, pick up ""Losing Sreak."""
4,LTJ proving they cant be labeled strictly a ska band,"the much anticipated LTJ album ""borders and boundries"" is quite different from the others. The traditional LTJ heavy Ska beats have been tossed out and replaced by new pop/punk melodies. Yes, this is definitely a drastic change, but the same ole meaninguful, humurous lyrics are still there. If ur a losing streak fan, u probally will not love this cd. The horns are not as powerfull and some tracks are slowed quite a bit...but hey.. i still like the cd...ever band needs to change up their music..or it gets too repetitive. Bottom Line ~If ur a hardcore LTJ fan, u should definitely get this cd...(most likely u have it already) if u have some of their old stuff, dont buy it rite away. Check out songs like ""Is this thing on"" ""Gainesvile Rock City"" and ""Bad Scene in a basement show"" for a good taste of the album."
2,What Happened to Less Than Jake???,"I went and bought Borders the day it came out, what a disappointment. They went from being really good ska-punk to cheese rock with a few horns thrown in. Every song sounds like every other song. You could kind of see them going downhill with ""Rockville"", it wasn't there best effort but it was still a decent CD. This one couldn't hold Rockville's jockstrap. What happened to songs like ""Johnny Quest.."", ""3 Quarts Drunk"", or ""Shotgun""? The worst song on ""Pezcore"" is better than anything on this CD. Other than the cool slide-thing on the CD case, this one is a letdown."
3,eh,"im really into the more fast ska-y LTJ so this definetely wasnt the best cd ive bought in a long time. the horns just bother me so yeah. anyyway, if you're really into the early dance hall crashers stuff, you'll probably like this."
3,NOT TYPICAL,"I have been disappointed, DEEPLY. This album, sorry to say it.. it SUCKS IT doesn't even deserve 3 stars.. but I didn't have the heart to give it less... if you loved Pez-Core and Losing Streak... and are expecting stuff like that on here, FORGET IT. Even they admitted that. Go buy Pezcore again instead... that's what they said themselves.. =o)"
4,They did it again,"This album just proves that ltj cannot make a bad cd. Even though this album doesn't sound very ska, it's still the same old less than jake. Their express something we can all relate to as did all their others."
3,Still amazing,"Even though I think this album is Less Than Jakes worst, most of it is simply amazing. Some of the songs are sung a bit too emotional compared to previous releases, but the lyrics are great. The guitar riffs are also way more advanced. Its obvious that LTJ has changed a lot since Hello Rockview, by for instance leaving out ska on every song except from Faction. This is however not the reason why I dislike the album. Their next CD 'anthem.', is in every possible way better even though they still hasn't gone back to 3rd wave ska. My favoritte tracks are Look What Happened, Gainesville Rock City and Pete Jackson is Getting Married. Borders & Boundaries wouldn't have been my first choise if you're new to LTJ, but if you like them, you should eventually buy it..."
1,What were they thinking?,"Ever since I heard Losing Streak, I loved Less than Jake. They always exeplfied what a ska band should be. I bought Pez-core and was also greatly satisfied with it. After Losing Streak came Hello Rockview. It was different, with more of a punk edge, but in my opinion, equally good to Losing Streak. Then there was Borders and Boundries. I popped it in the CD player with anticipation, and what do I get? Not ska, not punk, but utter mainstream [garbage]. Pathetic, slow songs with humorless lyrics and no ska guitar to speak of. They sound like Blink 182 with horns. This album was a sad attempt to make more money and, in the process, anger all the fans that truly love Less than Jake. This ... release makes me worried about what the new album will sound like. If they could go back to their roots that would be great, but sadly, I don't see that happening."
4,PRETTY GOOD FOR A BAND THAT ISN'T QUITE AN MTV FEATURE,"I bought this CD a few months ago. It stuck to me for awhile, then began to gradually slip away. With the new great rock bands like Puddle of Mudd and Lifehouse, this CD is knid of slipping into a 3-star album."
2,Borders and Boundries is a Disgrace,"When i first bought this CD i was expecting a follow-up to hello rockview (which was a good cd...but no where close to Losing Streak). Instead i found out that LTJ quickly turned from a ska band to a pop band. After Losing Streak which is definitly there best album out of the six LTJ albums i own, LTJ kind of dropped the ball with hello rockview, but it was still a decent cd. Now B&B sounds nothing like the old LTJ, a more mature LTJ, yes but who wants that. There is no more bari sax and it is mostly guitar now. IF you are a loyal LTJ fan then you could get this cd, but if you are just getting into ltj, please pick up a Losing Streak or a Pezcore. I only gave it 2 stars because the case is pretty cool."
1,CAN SOMEONE SAY SELLOUTS?,"LESS THAN JAKE WAS MY FAVORITE BAND Of aLL TIME. I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN. I OWN PEZCORE, LOSERS KINGS..., HELLO ROCKVIEW AND GREASED. THEY WERE SOME OF THE BEST MUSIC I HAVE EVER HEARD. THEIR BRASS WASAMAZING, THEY SOUNDED AMAZING. NOW THEY RELAESE THIS? I AM AMSHAMED TO BE LTJ FAN NOW. THERE IS HARDLY ANY BRASS IN THIS ALBUM AND SOUNDS SO DAMN POP-ISH. IM NOT TELLING U TO NOT GET THIS ALBUM, BUT IF ARE INTO THAT MTV SHIZNIT, GO AHEAD AND BUY THIS ALBUM AND ARE A TRUE LTJ FAN AND U WOULD SEE WHERE IM COMING FROM, GO BY LOSING STREAK BECAUSE TAHT IS LTJ IN THEIR PRIME..."
1,What Happened to Less Than Jake?,"Losing Streak is one of the best ska/punk albums ever made. Hello Rockview was good, but not as good as Losing Streak. Then this piece of [junk] came out. Everything on this album is slow and lacking in the usual ska energy. Only one song is worth listening to(Mr. Chevy Celebrity) and that is a short song with no horns. If you are a ska or punk fan, DON'T by this album. If you are a fan of Billy Joel or something old and lame like that, this is for you. I'm surprised Fat Mike allowed this atrocity to appear on his wonderful record company."
1,A new trashy LTJ,"I had wrote a review the day this cd came out saying it rocked. But i wrote that before the music actually hit got to my brain. Being a LTJ fan from the birth, this cd is pitiful. I basically dislike everysong on the cd. If you are a true ltj fan u will find this cd to be trash. I was so disapointed in it. It lacks everything that i ever liked, which basically is Horns, and just the SKA in itself. Do your self a favor, if you are just learning about LTJ now, save the trouble of wasting money on this, and buy Losing Streak. That is truly LTJ. As for this, this is just foreign LTJ, Trash in itself!One more thing, IM still a huge fan of LTJ, but untill they correct this mess, im sticking With Reel Big Fish."
4,Really good album,"Really good music, great creative songwriting. The songs seem to have a darker tone to them...that could be just me though, but good album"
3,Borders and Boundaries,"This is a good album, but it is nothing like classic Less Than Jake (Losers and Pezcore). They've moved away from ska and have become a hard rock band with horns. The only ska rhythm I heard was in the last track. I miss the funky ska-punk Less Than Jake. The two tracks about drinking are good. My favorite was Mr. Chevy Celebrity, the one about Mark Cruise. Good old LTJ screaming Mark Cruise whoa! 3 stars relative to other LTJ albums, 5 stars compared to other music out there today."
2,not a great cd....,"LTJ is a great band, who usually put out great cd's but in this case they didnt. It does have a few good songs but the rest are pretty bad. I would say this is their worst cd yet. If you are looking for a LTJ cd to buy, dont get this one get Hello Rockview. But if you have all the other cd's go ahead and get this one."
3,"Good CD, but not Less Than Jake","Coming from any other band, I would have said this was an excellent CD. Full of catchy pop-punk tunes, and more grown-up lyrics. Unfortunately, this CD disappoints me. There's almost NO ska on this CD, coming from a ska-core band. What? Are they too good for ska these days? After CDs like ""Losers, Kings and Things We Dont Understand"", ""Losing Streak"", and even ""Hello Rockview"", I was expecting more of some excellent ska-core. Instead I am greeted by complete pop-punk. Don't get me wrong, the songs are great, but I was expecting better. If you want to hear real Less Than Jake, get Losing Streak. I don't care if this CD was produced on Fat Wreck, and Losing Streak was on Capitol Records for all you stupid ""They sold out"" losers. Losing Streak is just a BETTER CD."
2,not their best,"this was not a usual LTJ cd. it seems like they almost completely lost their ska sound and went more to pop-punk. some of the horns on here sound fake, and the songs were pretty weak. but you should just get this cd for ""look waht happened (the last time)"" thats a really great song, so is ""last hour..."" even though its only pretty much 3 chords. but get pezcore, losing streak, and hello rockview before u get this one."
2,WHAT HAPPENED???!?!?!?!?!?!,hey guys. this album is kinda boring.... there are only like two ska songs. less than jake is a ska band... what happened? chack out sublime... they are the definition of ska.
1,Negative for this vendor,Charged $10 for shipping of item that weighed less than 1 lb. Item was not as described-form led me to believe it was 1-fits all. Shipped a med.: unusable. Returned purch price but kept the $10 shipping. I had to pay addnl. to ship back! Not happy at all. I'd have rather been able to purchase this locally where I could see what I was getting - but items for people in my husband's condition are difficult to purchase anywhere but on line. Not available in local pharmacies.
1,Get an editor...,"I didn't make it through the book. The story was blah and the grammar...oy vey...the grammar. Ms. Bevarly needs a writing coach and/or an editor to teach her how to write proper sentences. Too many sentences started with ""and"", ""or"", ""nor"", ""but"" and ""because"". It was very distracting and interfered with the flow of the story."
3,Generically Good,"I would recommend this book. The humor often seemed forced and repetitive, but overall it was a cute story with fun characters. The only thing that I had trouble with was the subplot with the characters of Shelby and Thomas - how exactly did they fit with the overall storyline? It didn't gel."
2,"Wow, I wanted to like this book....","I am so disappointed after reading less than 50 pages of a book that includes my hometown, Indianapolis. I was excited because our city does not hit the romance spotlight often, if at all. The repeating of thoughts by Hannah is what annoyed me most and would have rated Ms. Bevarly just one star, but she earned one more by mentioning Broad Ripple, the most popular (well-earned) neighborhood in the city, and that means she at least did a little homework. I buy a lot of books at flea markets and yard sales for little or no money, but I am sorry to say, if I had only paid fifty cents for this, it would still have been a major disappointment."
1,What is this?,"Okay, first of all, this should be a ""Little Shop of Horrors - Special Edition"" with ""Cry Baby Killer"" as an added bonus feature. And ""L.S. or H."" should be in black-and-white as it was filmed. This is disgraceful, and I hope Buena Vista refrains from messing up any more Corman titles in the future."
5,Mirrors of the soul,"This is not a book, this is a profound set of artistic images in the form of cards. These cards can be used in many ways. They are an incredible meditative and revelatory device.I obtained the first set of Soul Cards about two years ago, under the impression that I was purchasing a kind of tarot deck. I was only half right. These cards can easily be used for divination. They produce an incredible reactions in the viewer because of the powerful images they portray. These cards touch the subconscious and stir it up.Whenever I bring these cards out, I always get strong reactions out of those around me. I like to use them for simple three card divinations, but they can also be used for meditation. If you're lost for creative ideas you can pull a card and let it inspire you. Whatever your purpose, I highly recommend these cards. They're powerful and wonder full."
3,soul cards,Not what I expected. They are blank cards and not sure what I can do with them.I have the original Soulcards and love them so I was thinking these would be along the same lines but they are not.
2,not good workmanship,"one wing was only partially attached and other places the seams were't sewed. Too late to return so I patched it up myself, but shouldn't have had to."
2,"Beats Get 4 stars, Rich Boy Gets 1","If someone - anyone else -- had been given the same production courtesy of Don Da Polow, this would be a southern classic. The tracks are BANGIN'! No complaints there.But Rich Boy CAN'T RAP. I don't know what else to say. He CANT RAP. He's may be one of the worst to ever pick up a mic on a major label release. On the Laziness meter he outranks Snoop Dogg and Fabolous combined. The Don should boycott him and work on beats for artists who can really contribute."
1,bich boy...lol,"Ok is rich boy missing half his tongue or does he have his man's love in his mouth? His rhymes come out of his mouth like he is mumbling. Not to mention that the rhymes that you do understand are super wack and unlyrical. This boring so called album has some dope beats on some of the songs, some ridiculously annoying hooks, and one great guest appearance. Andre 3000's verse is better than all the other songs on the album combined. Nelly, jenny jones are horrible emcees and they add to the tom foolery of this album. Listening to this album is similar to ripping your fingers nails off with pliers. I agree with norfeest, wait for the instrumental."
1,Bad Influence,"This CD shocked me. At first I was listening and enjoying the beats on every track. But then listening to the actual content of each song, B*tch this and h*e that. Come on, as a young female, how am I supposed to bump this in my car? Every single song on the CD is disrespectful. You know what really makes me mad, this is what's supposed to be hot, popular. What kind of message is this sending to our young black men? Our young women? I would not recommend this for any one, especially anyone under the age of 16 or any woman."
4,good album,"i was shocked that i would like this album. I did'nt care for the single that he had,so i just new i would hate this,but it turned out to be a good album."
3,Meh,"I don't know about this album. I always find myself playing the same two songs, ""Throw Some D's"" & ""Throw Some D's (Remix)."" I minus well should of went to itunes and download those two tracks. Although every track is listenable, they just don't get me hungry enough to listen to it over and over again. It's now where I can go out somewhere and the songs stick with me. On the bright side, this dude has potential."
1,GARBAGE,"By far one of the worse albums 2 come out the south since, well since I can remember, GARBAGE, on the highest level, I actually took the CD back to Best Buy, walked up to customer service and told them they can have it back and keep the money. If u are trying to be Rich, U need to come up with a better game plan cause u sure didnt put effort in this peice of work. U want to be a Rich Boy, I want to be a Rich MAN, Now how Rich is that?"
3,LISTEN,"This isn't a review. I'm just putting this on a popular CD to tell you something. The rap game is weak lately, and clowns like Rich Boy are making it worse. If your looking to break away from this stuff, go to Myspace and check out the tracks of Mu Dills, Snipe-Won, Big Lou, Jace the Great, and some others. They very tight. Notice they all from New Jersey, that's where I'm from. Lotta people look at Jersey and go ""Dat ain't nothing compared to Compton or St. Louis or (etc.),"" but places like Paterson, East Orange, Newark, and Camden are some of the most dangerous places in the U.S. and these guys be reppin bout it. Don't rate this down cuz it ain't bout the CD, just give these guys a go. Thanks to those who listened.P.S. Not a kid, just don't wanna sign in."
4,Not that bad,"It is a accurate but really long time KoRn fans would know most of the information in it, it may help maybe give more details to it but really all the book did was make what i knew from ""unofficial sources"" official and legit for my research paper on Jon Davis as a writer. If you are a parent who maybe curious about there child's favorite band that screams FAGET! real loud it's a good read. KoRn fans who care about little momentos like that I guess it's worth spending the ten dollars on the book because if KoRn is a band who you've supported from start and beyond it's kind of like a cool little item to show your dedication to the band. Hopefully after the next KoRn album a catch up version of this book will be written."
2,Physical Relief,Jury is still out. Must use this product for at least 60 days. So far there is no improvement. Hopeful this will change.
2,Ears still ringing- no change at all,I've had the ringing in my ears for years-high pitch and wavering. Very annoying and was hoping it would go away with this. But I've been taking this for 2 weeks and nothing has changed. I thought with all the good reviews I would finally get some relief. So frustrating. Thumbs down.
1,Total waste of money,"Total waste of money after buying 2 boxes of Lipo-Flavonid Plus (200 caplets) and taking 6 a day I have no relieve at all, save your money and spend it on your kids.Now if i could just get my money back that would be greatLipoflavonoid Plus Caplets 100"
1,No help at all,This product did absolutely no good at all for me. I was very disappointed.The ringing and thumping are as bad as ever.
1,Dissatisfied Consumer,"Per my ear doctor's recommendation (with no guarantees), with faith I took Lipoflavonoid supplement for 12 months at 3 pills per day...Needless to say, it cost me a lot of money and the constant ringing/loud hissing noises/pitches in one, then both ears, didn't reduce, let alone diminish; instead they have gotten worse! Due to my frustration et al, I am calling this supplement a HOAX - another one of those snake medicines(?) :/"
1,Snake Oil,"Everyone who has ringing in their ears hopes for a miracle cure. This alas is not that. Since none of the doctors know what actually causes the ringing, it begs the question how can they know how to cure it. Followed the directions tot the letter and four months later the ringing is just as bad as it ever was. Don't waste your money"
5,HELP STOP RINGING IN THE EARS,"GREAT IT WORKS!BETTER THAN A SOUND DEVICE.TOOK ABOUT 1 WEEK.SLEEP, WORK AND ENJOY LIFE WITHOUT RINGING AND BUSSING IN THE EARS."
4,The definitely helped with sinus pressure.,"I took these for about a month. I have been meaning to buy more because I think what I noticed was definitely not a placebo effect. I am hard of hearing and I also have tinnitus a lot. It seemed like it was helping the tinnitus a little, but the bigger difference I noticed was a reduction of sinus pressure which helped my hearing a bit. The only thing keeping me from buying more is how expensive they are. I was taking 2-3 day."
1,complete rip-off !,"I tried this product for tinnitus with no results at all. IMHO, this product is a complete scam and should be taken off the market."
2,Totally worthless,"It did no good. You can tell by the supposed guarantee, they want to buy 2 or more bottles before you decide it doesn't work. They know at that point most people will just give up."
2,Didn't work for me,"Maybe these pills work for certain types of tinnitus but not for me. I tried them b/c I was desperate but the pills are huge and you need to take a lot of them - 6 per day. It gets tiring taking that many pills in a day and not seeing any significant improvement. Your tinnitus may change, get better, get worse, but I don't think the pills have anything to do with it. They're not harmful, so if you suffer from tinnitus, I would try a small bottle just to see but don't waste a ton of money on a big bottle."
1,No change,"After several months and 700 tablets, I had no change at all. This was very disappointing since I was so hopeful after reading other reviews. I'm not willing to do another batch of 500."
1,Bummer,I was really hoping these would help my ringing but they did not. It was worth a try though. Maybe it will work for you. :)
1,Complete WASTE of money and time!,"My father had a horrible fall, resulting in him being hospitalized. After coming home, he had a very LOUD ringing in both ears for 5+ months straight, and so far it hasn't stopped. He tried Lipoflavanoid for many months, and it hasn't done ANYTHING to ease his Tinnitus and it hasn't changed whatsoever. Sleep is still impossible and so is functioning throughout the day. I do not recommend this horrible product.Ring ring ring ringggggggg!!!!!!"
1,DOESN'T WORK,I have been taking this for 2.5 months with no results. Save your money this does absolutely nothing to improve tennitis.
1,I can't hear you,Guaranteed No results. Will you refund my money? I am very disappointed with this product. I followed the directions and took three tablets each day for six months as recommended and in that period of time there was absolutely no difference in my hearing and it did NOT have any impact on the ringing (tinnitus) in my ear. Stay away from this product. Amazon should stop selling it.
4,Somewhat better,Excessive ringing in one ear started four months ago. I started taking six Lipo-Flavonoid pills daily about 40 days ago. My tolerance for ringing in ear is somewhat better (sleep and rest seem to be key). It is difficult to determine that the level of ringing has actually improved because if I dwell on ringing it appears to be as bad as ever. The product information said it would take about 60 days to get full results. I will probably discontinue use of Lipo-Flavinoid after 60 days to see if it has an impact on my tolerance for ringing. Even if it is a placebo it may still be worth the money!
1,Did not work. Saw Chiropractor and got ringing to stop!!!,"I had hearing loss in my left ear for about a year, along with an annoying engine sound. Not a ringing sound, but a whooshing engine sound that corresponded to my heart beat. I tried these pills since all else had failed and they failed, too. Ear ""specialists"" told me I either had acoustic neuroma (I did not) or I would just have to live with this the rest of my life. A friend referred me to a Chiropractor and he reset my back and neck and the ringing diminished and I could hear a lot better out of my left ear. It didn't hurt at all and took just a few seconds. I still have a couple more appointments since it will take a while for my body to adjust and stay in place since it has been out of place for over a year. Go see a chiropractor! Find the oldest one in your area who has seen it all! Good luck!"
1,Does nothing,"I have had tinnitus for as long as I can remember. So, in desperation, I thought to give this product a try based on the recommendations I read on Amazon and elsewhere. I have been taking the product as instructed for about 6 - 8 weeks and find the only thing relieved was my bank balance. I would caution everyone to thoroughly research their problem, seek advice and help from a reputable ENT, then go ahead and try it if you wish, but don't have high expectations. I did and I have been disappointed."
1,Does not work.,"The product label says to take 2 pills after a meal 3 times a day for fastest results. Well, that's exactly what I did for an entire month and I noticed no improvement at all. It might have even made things worse as my ears feel more stuffy and the ringing is more noticeable, like when you bend over too fast and the blood rushes to your head. The product is supposed to increase blood flow to the ears, so maybe that's what's causing it. I guess it's worth a try since there are several good reviews, but everyone's tinnitus is different."
1,"""Doesn't work at all","Lipoflavonoid Plus Caplets 100, ""Doesn't work at all I purchase 2 bottles and took as directed; save your money this is just pure junkFrank """
2,NOPE!,I had high hopes for this product but no results-except for the vitamin content its pretty much usless. To have to take these pills for 6 months (3 a day) to MAYBE get results is I think is bit much. Good luck!
5,Helps decrease the ringing,I have been taking lipoflavonoid for 18 months. It has toned down the ringing in my ears but did not 'cure' the ringing. I did not expect it to be cured but sure helped sleeping for more than 1 hour at a time! When I don't take it for a week the intensity increases.
1,"Didn't work at ALL for me, but seeing a chiropractor did.","These pills did nothing for me, but a friend suggested seeing a chiropractor since I think the sound in my ear is due to something structural around me ear. (All the ""specialist"" docs say my ear is fine, but I hear my heartbeat very loudly in my ear and it's not fine.) With two crunches of my neck, the chiropractor got a lot of the hearing back in my ear, but the volume isn't as good as my other ear. Still much better though. I think these pills made me gain about 7 pounds. I lost the weight after I stopped taking them."
1,No change,"I have used three bottles 100 count, taking two pills three times a day and still have the same amount of ringing in my ears. For me it was a waist of money..."
1,Useless,I used the entire bottle of Lipo-Flavonoid caplets with no apparent reduction of the noise in my ears! The high pitched noise is still present.Frank Seymour
1,Mostly dissapointed so far,Two months into taking this product and the ringing in my ears hasn't changed one little bit. I have a couple more months of pills left to take and I don't think I'll reorder them. Live and learn. Should have spent the money on a trip to a ENT doctor and had it checked out.
2,Did Nothing,"I have trouble with ringing in my left ear, and my Doctor recommended Lipo-Flavinoid; as it is touted as a possible cure for tinnitus. After three months of use, I found no difference whatsoever in the ringing."
2,Don't waste your money!,"When I ordered this product, I didn't expect it to work, but I was so hoping it would, so I ordered it. Unfortunately I was right. It didn't work!"
1,Does not work,Have been using this for almost 1 month (2 pills 3 times a day) so far no difference in my very loud ringing. I will continue using for 3 months as explained in the literature and let you know if anything changes
1,Don't waste your money,Plain and simple; it doesn't work. This product did absolutely nothing to reduce the hissing/ringing even though I followed the directions to the letter.
1,Hocus pocus!,Im an athele and a supplement taker. This stuff did absolutely nothing for me.. Beware of any product that tells you to take massive doses in order to get results. If it were any good or potent wouldnt that be dangerous? I for one think that this is a scam product preying on hurting folks.. Dont waste your money...
1,Lipo-Ripoff,"I have tinnitus in my left ear probably caused by high blood pressure, anyway, I am well into my second bottle of 100 tablets with no improvement at all. I will finish the bottle and then do an evaluation. If no improvement then it's adios .HB Portland, OR"
3,waiting for another month,"I am a Registered nurse with tinnitus now for 3 years. It started after a really bad cold and had not left since. I started taking this for just a week now. 2 caplets three times a day. So far I have noticed a decrease in level of ringing at least 20-30%less. One morning I woke up without the ringing and I really had to listen for it ( it was still there but not as loud). I am not completely sold that it will completely cure my tinnitus. I might go as far as three months and see what will happen. I will,however, write another review after a month."
1,ENT Doc was right!,"Over the years(10+) I've asked various Drs and regular folks ""is there a cure for tinitus?"" Everyone has assured me the "" the damage has been done-unfixable"" Well, after taking the Lipo Flavaniod cure for over a month I can report that the experts are correct. This is just another scam that gives the Wholistic Medical movement a black eye. Don't fall for it! D."
5,Lipoflavonoids work for me.,Lipoflavonoids work for me. After many years of noise in my ears I found relief with lipoflavonoids. This purchase was fairly priced and met my expectations.
3,Not sure if it helps,"I have been using this product for a bit over two months now. I took 6 pills a day for two months, reducing to 3 pills a day after that. I have yet to see a noticeable improvement. Occasionally the intensity of the ringing in my ears is reduced for a couple of hours. But the effect is very temporary, and it comes right back again. I will keep taking the pill for another 4 months as recommended. Will probably stop after that if I don't see any significant improvement."
2,Don't get your hopes up.,"If you order this thinking the ringing in your ears is going to stop, forget it.While there may be a tiny fraction of the population that this will help, most people suffer from nerve damage in the ear, and this product will not help at all.The company was slow to ship, and the product is relatively expensive.Bottom line - snake oil."
5,This product works for me,I was having problems with dizziness when rolling over in bed that occassionally carried over to daytime activities. Some ringing in my ears but this was not the problem that took me to see an ENT. Several visits to the ENT and an MRI revealed possible Menieres Disease. The ENT recommended this product. 3 capsules a day and it took a couple weeks to notice a diffence but now the dizzy spells are gone as long as I continue to take this product. I have occassionally stopped for 3-4 days and dizziness returns. Have been taking for 4 months now.
1,DID NOT WORK FOR ME,I have ringing in my left ear. I had a hearing test which showed no problems. Had a MRI which showed no problems. My ENT doctor told me that millions of people have ringing and in most cases nothing can be done to correct it. So I decided to give LIPO-FLAVONOID a try. I used this product as directed for six months with absolutely no improvement. I really did not expect it to help as it is just a combination of vitamins. I suppose if a person has a vitamin deficiency then this product might help.
1,No Help,"I took 100 caplets following the heavy dose recommendation. I had no beneficial effects. While taking the caplets, I experienced red whelps with itching on my lower legs, elbows, arms, and neck about the size of fingertips -- like insect bites except the red places were almost perfectly round."
3,Lipo-Flavonoid,"I have not yet used for 30 days. But in the time I have used it, I have noticed no difference in tinnitus. It was delivered on time and in good condition."
2,May Take Time,"I have only taken this product for one month and sometimes it takes longer for results, so we will see what happens after another month."
3,some reliese,i used it for about 60 days(3 times a day by 2).i have ringing in ears.have some relieve.do i have to take more?
1,Don't waste your money,I have tried this product using 2 pills 3 times daily for 6 months. It doesn't work! I don't know why they claim it is #1 doctor recommended. I visited 4 different doctors with different specialties and they all told me that it doesn't work!
1,It sucks,Ok I've tried it for 2 months. Ringing is loud as ever. Not even a slight decrease. A total waste of time and money!
1,Lipo flavenoid is worthless as is the manufacturer,"I took the product as prescribed- 6 pills/day for 60 days. Zero benefit for tinitus and minor hearing loss. Product says ""guaranteed results"". I contacted them to determine what that means. They never replied. Don't waste your money and don't support a company that opts to not provide support."
2,Isn't working for me.,"I've been using this product for almost 30 days and I have yet to notice any difference in my tinitus. The instructions say to use it for 60 days and you will notice a difference, but I would have hoped after 30 days, I would be able to notice SOME kind of difference. I don't think I'm going to continue it for another 30 days to find out."
1,Here is my review,The instructions say you should see results within 60 days taking 1 caplet 3 times a day. But you can speed up results by taking 2 caplets 3 times a day. I have been taking 2 caplets 3 times a day with NO RESULTS. I will finish bottle and NOT buy this product again. If the manufacture wants me to continue send me a FREE BOTTLE and I will give you my honest opinion IF IT WORKS. Right now it was a waste of my money and I would like to have a REFUND.
1,ear problems could be BPV,"these types of product do not work for me but the blanket diagnosis of Menier's should be reevaluated in terms of Benign Positional Vertigo. Physical manipulation of the head puts back some of the material which has gotten loose from within the inner ear. It can jam the gyroscopic function of the ear and scramble brain signals which trigger often severe vertigo. Once other possible causes were eliminated, simple physical therapy eliminated my vertigo and lessened the ringing. I have not had severe vertigo in several years. Very minor symptoms may require a repeat of the exercises which can be done at home once the physical therapist has established which side (or both) and shows you how it is done. It usually only require one or two tries to nip it in the bud."
1,Did Nothing For Me....,"I have tinnitus, and advanced Meniere's (Virtigo and that nasty world). Decided to try this product to lessen the ringing. Been taking these for a couple of weeks now, and find no effect. I do see about 50/50 on people claiming it does work, so if you experience this world, it still might be worth a try."
2,"Sadly, Did Not Work For Me","I tried this for one month, at the maximum dose, as written on the box. Unfortunately, it did not diminish the ringing."
3,Too expensive!,"While Lipoflavinoid caplets seem to work well enough, they are very expensive, especially when they must be taken 3 times a day."
2,Over Rated For Stopping The Ringing in Your Ears,My Ears Ring A Lot and this product is advertised as a Cure. It might work on some but not Me. I am on my second 500 count bottle and no change. I will give it up when this bottle is gone.
3,Still waiting,"On month 5 with a break at 2months for surgery. My ears are still ringing, but will give one more month"
2,Doesn't work,"Bought two bottles, followed the directions and took for 60 days. Made me jittery, upset my stomech and lost sleep. Had no effect on my ringing or hearing. A waste of money for me."
3,Ear noise relief,"After reading the ""hype"" about this product It seemed likeI could at least try it.I have had a long standing issue with ""ringing"" in my ears.This product seems to help a little bit but is not a cure.The mention of having to use it for months till there isa real decrease in the noise frequency perhaps was a clueto the lack of real effectiveness of the product."
3,lipo-flav -no-noise,"Got 2 boxes for a 60 day guaranteed ringless treatment. Day 30, still have ringing, keeping fingers crossed. 60 day guarantee, we'll see...."
2,This book is a puzzle by itself,"I bought this book thinking it would help me in solving LEgenda of Zelda a Link to the past. What I Found was a hard to understand guide, with no logical sequence between its chapters and it is really hard to relate the information in one chapter with another. Example: One chapter is only for bosses another one for items ... why not write a book that is step by step, including bosses and items as they appear throughout the game?"
3,Not bad,"These Panasonic headphones aren't bad. They are very lightweight and they seem to be durable. They also fold up conviently so you can keep them in your pocket. The downside, however, is that they can get to be very uncomfortable when you have them in your ears for a long period of time. I'd pass on these and get a different pair with foam cushions around your ears rather than these uncomfortable plasic buds."
1,Not helpful at all!,"This video was more a commercial for each of the restaraunts as opposed to a ""Master Guide"". There were no secrets given and the basics that were given were so basic that I'm sure they were trying to speak to a group of 6th graders - home economics class. I am so upset with this purchase that when my wife offered to sell it in our next garage sale I told her no for fear of someone else wasting their money on this waste of a video."
5,Oh My God!!,"I would give it 100 stars if it was possible!! This book was such an eye opener and real book!!! I can say enough about the way it touched me both inside and out. It is definitely a THIN LINE. Gina, you GO GIRL!! Sydney was a strong sister even with all her trials and tribulations. Rick, finally woke up, before it was too late. All I can say is read this book and definitely add it to your collection!!"
3,A Little More Depth Please,"My enjoyment of this book was only so-so. This was the first book I read by Kimberla Lawson Roby, and I didn't know what to expect, but I was a little disappointed. The characters didn't seem well developed. The domestic abuse scenes were weak, and she didn't expound on the child molestation of the oldest daughter at all. I wouldn't necessarily call it a waste of money, but I wish I'd bought a different book instead of this one. I've read much better books and think that Ms. Roby could have done a much better job with the characters and with the storyline. I wish I could give this book 2 1/2 stars instead of 3, because 3 seems a bit high and I think 2 is a bit harsh. All in all, it's not a horrible read, it just could have been better."
3,Predictable yet intriguing,"I would really like to rate this book a 3.5 ""It's a thin line"" is an improvement since her earlier works... KLR touches upon critical issues that plague many a family... HOWEVER, the only thing that made me cringe was the part where she has whomever hear the phone ringing, answering the telephone, saying hello...everything before getting to the point...it happened with every phone call.... I liked all of the characters but wanted to know more about Sydney...I felt that she dropped the bomb about her out of nowhere towards the end of the book.....she should have mentioned the nightmares or something a little earlier.... Phillip's character was frightening and jumped off the pages...I found the dialogue very believable.... She also could have touched upon the baby brother's reasons for being afraid to commit to Samantha....just a little more character development... All in all, kudos to the author for this endeavor....I am looking forward to reading her next book..."
4,A Page Turner,Is it true that the oldest child holds the key to responsibility???? I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. Kimberla Lawson Roby has done it again.
3,I am just NOT into this author's works!,"I guess it's a matter of taste. Ms. Roby really isn't that bad. This book is so much like all her others. Like most contemporary African American writers, Ms. Roby needs to write ONLY when she has something ORIGINAL to say. It seems like she and many others are simply writing to make a living. I can still recommend this book if you are into these ""soap opera-like"" plots. But for me, a pretty cover does NOT make the story more exciting, Ms. Roby. Good luck."
5,Whew,This is scary. Kimberla Lawson Roby tackles a very sensitive and distrubing subject. She does well in depicting the horrors of being in an abusive relationship.
2,Not what I expected,This book was not what I expected from Kimberla Lawson Roby. I completed the book but I did not really enjoy it like I do her other books.
4,Just Good...Not Great,"This was just an OK and good story. There was really nothng outstanding, so I don't have much to say. If you are looking for an exciting read--DO NOT GET THIS BOOK. But if you are looking for a plain, good story, get this book."
5,VIVIDLY REALISTIC,"Once again, Kimberla Lawson-Roby has written a novel that touches every emotion that you possess. I could feel and relate to Delores, the mother of Sydney, Gina and Rick. She was a stronglady, who knew how to listen to her children, state her position and not be judgemental. Kimberla touched on some very sensitivesubjects, such as, sexual abuse, mental abuse and pure selfish behavior of some siblings, in time of need. I recommendthe reading of this novel to all families with more than 2 or 3 siblings, because this novel is very eye opening and thought provoking. I can't wait for Kim's next writing!"
5,What you will feel after reading this novel.,"A great writer (Ernest Gaines) once said when he writes his desire is to write characters, WITH character that helps the reader bring out their character. Kimberla has done this in each of her novels. . . and especially in It's A Thin Line. The words, are moving and throught provoking but above all, after you finish you will learn something from the characters (especially Sydney). And after all is said and done. . . isn't that the essence of great fiction?"
4,A good sweat,I always get a good sweat working out with this DVD. It is not rigorous so it doesn't get me exhausted or anything and I enjoy the relaxing motion of hula dancing too. I was able to accomplish the steps after a few tries. The video shows the whole body (especially the most important feet for the steps). The two DVDs have mostly similar steps. The thing to be aware about is that the DVD can get loose in the container.
3,good and bad,"these are 2 fun work outs, they really do work your muscles and help you loose weight if that is your goal. however the instruction is very poor. you go from a basic step to a difficult variation with out any instruction on how to do it. in one section you go from a basic Kaholo (hip sways + a step) to a kaholo with level changes with out her actually showing you how to do the level changes. I actually have to stop my work out and watch her carefully over and over in some sections until i figure out how to do it. over all its a nice video once you have the dance down.. but getting there is not easy."
2,A Disappointing workout,So I really like the idea of Hula dance as a way to workout. It seems like it would be really fun and simple to do. I found that its wasn't challenging enough and that I gave me NO feel that I had worked out. I personally like to feel that ache in my muscles after a good workout. With this I got nothing. I would really like to know if this works for anyone else. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who really wants to have a good workout. On the plus side though it was really fun to do : )
2,Island Girl Dance Fitness Workout: Cardio Hula/Hula Abs & Buns - 2 Volume Set,Slow video. I chose this video over Island Girl Dance Fitness Workout for Beginners: Hula Abs & Buns expecting that I would find more cardio workouts. not much movement to make your heart works.
5,Hawaii,I ordered this tape because I lived in Hawaii and came to love the culture. While there I didn't get the chance to learn how to dance hula. Now I can while exercising at the same time. The DVD came promptly and is in excellent condition. I'm well pleased with the seller.
5,Very Happy,"I received this product within the week that I bought it. It was in new condition, still in the wrapper. I am sure it is very good. I have not had a chance to use it but I have her other dvd workouts and enjoy them. I am sure it will be good."
4,Love it.,"Love this product. I am a little uncoordinated, taking time to learn the moves is essential. Good workout though! I felt the burn right away."
3,An Interesting Disc,"This is an interesting disc. It's better than I thought it would be; but, like many SACD recordings, it sounds rather flat and lifeless. Also, the intensity or authenticity of the original recording seems missing. I also miss the humming. I'm not sorry I bought it; but I prefer the original recording and performance."
1,"A pale, antiseptic version of Gould.","I agree with all of the other reviewers who were disappointed by this CD. It's is a prime example of how computers can't really touch the artistry of a human being, at this point in time. I recommend his older recordings, which are lower fidelity but capture the performance of a manic artistic genius.The Zenph computerized piano simply does not capture the correct dynamics, nor does it feel like you're listening to an actual human being playing (obviously because you're not!). All of the warmth, humor, angst, and simple emotion behind Gould's plays is lost entirely here. The sound quality is fine, but what is sound quality without great music to back it up?Not recommended."
3,Binaural a big disappointment,"I purchased this CD for its binaural version of the Goldbergs (tracks 33 to 64). Excellent clarity but far too clinical sounding and no depth to the soundstage--it lacked the crucial 3rd dimension that is the essence of binaural. I auditioned the CD through my Stax lambda pro electrostatic headphones as well as over my speakers with a processor set to panorama binaural. Both sounded flat and clinical. The surround version on the first 32 tracks gave more satisfaction but lacked a completely realistic piano sound. Still, the recording does reveal Gould's amazing virtuosity in all its glory."
2,Neither one thing nor the other,"I did not, when I put this disc on, expect to hear a Glenn Gould back from the dead in my sitting room. Nor to hear the ""soul"" of the original recording. But I did hope that the disc might reveal more of the Goldbergs - as so many other performances on disc have done - but I am not sure it does. Pleasant to listen to but no more than that. Neither echt Gould nor something to savour for itself."
4,Really delicious!,"These crackers are really good! I don't know if the previous reviewers are correct that they are deceptively marketed. I know that I can see whole seeds in the crackers and they taste good. Plus, in a comparison to other crackers that my family likes- they have less sugar and sodium and more protein and fiber. They are a superior cracker to a lot of others out there and are a huge hit with my 1 year old. She is able to hold the cracker easily and take bites safely. I don't know if they are as 'healthy' as they advertise, but it is better than feeding a 1 year old something in the shape of an animal or dyed a rainbow of unnatural colors."
3,Deceptive ingredients list,"Grainsfirst's name and marketing is designed around a deception in their ingredients list. They group together all of the whole grains AND SEEDS, in order to put this ""item"" first on the list, before white flour, which would otherwise be first. This is not a whole-grain product.It tastes good, unless you really want a whole-grain product, but it is overpriced."
4,Chico--the Wildest Marx Brother,"This is a slight but candid look at the most fascinating Marx Brother. Chico was the eldest and the one who propelled the Brothers' act into big time show biz. He was also a compulsive gambler and lover, a math wiz and could play any instrument that engaged his ever-shifting attention. His daughter, Maxine, presents a loving yet candid portrait of the father she (and every other woman in his life) loved."
1,"Awful, dull, pointless","I read this book as a teen when it first came out. Didn't think much of it. Last week I re-read it to see if I now felt differently. I don't.The heroine is completely unlikeable. The writing is annoying and repetitive. The plot is almost not there. It does give one a small glimpse into Hollywood/Malibu circa 1987... But not much else. Hard to believe that Amy was a VP of Production at a studio at one time, but, given half the crap that comes out of Hollywood, maybe not."
1,This book seems dangerous,"I thought the book was poor, but, acceptable for a beginner, who was willing to read many books before this book. Then I read page 106, Gallandar sites a rule ""Never Buy Firms With A Share Price Over $ 25.That is pure absurdity. Don't read this book, even if it is free, unless, you are receiving more than $25 to read it."
5,Why This Book Is Selling Out In So Many Places,VARIOUS NEWSPAPER REVIEWSThe Globe & Mail - 'The Most Classic of Contrarians' .............................................Financial Post - 'Newsletter Guru ... his newsletter's stock picks have averaged an annual gain of 33.9% over the past five years' .............................................The Vancouver Sun - 'Investment guru Benjamin Gallander ...'The Toronto Star - 'A year ago Gallander warned on CBC Radio's This Morning that problems in Asia would be more devastating than others were predicting at the time. He was right.'
4,Great little puzzle!,"My son (18 months) loves this little puzzle. It is easy to put the pieces in their respective places (only 4 pieces) and there are lots of different textures to experience (soft and puffy, rubber tread, etc.) I love this puzzle, too, since it is small-ish and easy to carry along and store, and (best of all!) each piece is attached with a pretty ribbon so they never get lost or misplaced! Great puzzle! Well worth the money!"
3,"Bright, but too big and outdated battery","I'm a typical man. I want a 10,000,000hp lawnmower. BUT, this light is way too large. Too heavy. Battery is always in need of a charge. I'll probably chunk it and buy something else."
1,Don't waste your money,"On the surface, this is a nice looking pot with good features. Well, as many reviewers have said, be careful. You will burn yourself at least once. The handles are tricky and you have to tip at a certain angle or the top will fall out and your pasta will tumble into the sink. However, it is definitely non-stick and easy to clean, but you won't care because you will have lost your appetite waiting for water to boil in it. I am online today looking for a Calphalon hard anodized pot even if it costs twice as much. No one should wait over 25 minutes for water to boil!"
2,Joining in with the naysayers,"I have tried to like this pot - in theory it sounds great, but in actual usage, it is very problematic. The non-locking handles are the chief drawback - you need to awkwardly hold them closed with pot holders while draining - and the acute angle needed to remove all the water inevitably means leaking hot water on to the holders and hence on you. Back to the tried and true colander in the sink for me."
1,horrible product!,"Both times we have used this pan, the lid slipped off and spilled it's contents into the sink!!! Doesn't work well at all. If it wasn't so expensive for shipping I would send it back."
3,Not of good quality,Surafce get's easily scratched. Not a good quality. Not worth $9.99 that I paid.
4,Nice lite pasta pot..that drains too !,Nice..lite..Pasta Pot ..that also drains. Easy to handle ..clean and use.I always wanted a self draining pot for my kitchen. Sometimes I just don't feel like getting out the big strainer..and worse having to put it back after use....this pot solves all of those problems..and quickly....It heats the water FAST..the non stick inner covering makes for spahgetti out in a twinkle...or butter it up quick-and-in-a-flash... all in the same pot...easy..easy..easy! Keeps it warm while you finish the garlic bread off !!Very Nice...including the price !!Only problem...not for the kids to use.....and hang onto the handles tight when straining...the first time I flipped it..I didn't ..the top moved and all the pasta..along with the boiling hot pasta water went into the sink !!! (and some onto me ).....but that one time did not prevent me from using it again...just hold on to the fold over handle..and don't let the kids fool around with it.
3,pasta pot,"I like the idea of draining the water from the pasta by using a pot such as this. The user needs to be careful, though, and not lose the grip that is required to hold the lid in place while draining off the hot water. The lid will come off even if just one side is not held in place. Another manner of keeping the lid in place while draining the water should have been implemented."
4,Not sure what everyone is whining about,"This is the best pan I have ever bought for $10. True it is not the best pan out there, but for the price it is. It has a great non stick surface that is easy to clean, and a heavy duty bottom for even heating.Not sure how all these people seem to burn themselves, it not very complicated to drain a pot and keep the lid on. Heck the handles hold the lid so it doesn't fall off.The only thing I wish it had was a lid that wasn't vented, for cooking things other than pasta, either be able to close the vents/strainer or come with an additional lid. But that is such a minor thing."
3,truck bed cover,"This cover could have been designed better. It does not provide complete water resistance, as there is a space at the front where water can enter. Getting the cover off and on (especially on) is a hassle! Having 2 people to do this is helpful. It must be tucked in evenly, and I can see that it will not be very long lasting. It does stay on at freeway speeds, thankfully."
4,Excellent reference for RF circuit design and formulas,A good variety of useful designs and formulas. A must for RF engineers reference library.
2,Small,"The inside hanging part is too short for any of the American Girl doll dresses. It's only good for shirts and skirts. Otherwise it is cute and my 9 yo daughter loved the design. It's pretty narrow, too, so most of her clothes ended up not fitting in it."
4,Doll clothes have a space of their own!,"Sturdy product, on time delivery for Christmas! Will help me teach my daughter that clothes need to be put away, not strewn all over the floor!"
2,I am disappointed...,"I have to say, I am one who never really returns anything, but I am unhappy with this item. It is definitely smaller than the advertised product dimensions-the box actually says 12""X20""X10""-which is not what is advertised. It is very cute, but far smaller than what I was expecting. It seems like it is meant more for a Barbie doll as opposed to 20"" baby dolls. Again it is very cute and there is nothing physically wrong with it-it just doesn't seem practical for it's purposes and definitely not for the extra couple of dollars. I will be returning it and continue my search for hopefully a slightly larger armoire.Rorie V. AZ"
4,Armoire for Dolls,"Cute, my daughter loved it and I have been a fan of many of the Melissa and Doug products I have purchased in the past. The main problem was that I ordered a pink armoire and received a white one--now this is actually better, and matched the rest of my daughter's doll furniture, but it wasn't what I ordered, in fact there wasn't an option for a white armoire. The other minor complaint is that the back of the drawers come off easily because of the design--a bit of wood glue and we were all set, but a bit of an annoyance.The design and functionality is great, very cute and unique!!"
1,disappointed,"this armoire is really disappointing. and usually I love Melissa and Doug items. it is smaller than I expected. too small, really, for the American Girl doll clothes. the dresses are longer than the space and end up hitting the bottom because they can't hang straight all the way down. more importantly, none of the hangers I have from several different sources fit!! the diameter of the hang bar is so big, the hangers can't fit over it which makes the entire piece of furniture useless. take a pass on this one for sure and spend a little extra money to get a bigger, better item elsewhere."
4,Great Overview on Retirement,"Retirement on a Shoestring has sections that really add to what I have read on retirement. I especially like the chapters on College Towns in retirement, RVs and Retirement, and Mobile Homes and Retirement. The book is easy to read, and it is full of great statistics, tips and insights. This is a fine book for someone contemplating retirement. It makes one feel that success in retirement is just around the corner."
3,Action and plot outstanding! new war toys too complicated.,"I have to say that the author is excellent at making the reader feel like he or she ""Have the Conn"". The scenario of Islamics countries forming a singular union state one day is a plausible one. The question is, why couldn't he follow the Navy Chief's most valuable advice; The ""KISS"" principle, or ""Keep It Simple Stupid"". We did not need all the complicated submarines and aircraft with electronic jamming pods...yattaw, yattaw, yattaw. I mean, I am Lt. SWO in the Navy and I skipped a few paragraphs myself. ""Voyage of the Devilfish"", That was KISS (Of course, you know it was good, DiMercurio has promoted ALL his books in every single review page for his books) A 6 might be a bit harsh to some, but when you go into the ""innerworks of the future of aviation and submarine warfare"" you will force most of your readers to take a nap!"
2,Good but not realistic enough,"DiMercurio has unequalled knowledge of submarines and undersea warfare and the encounters between the islamic super-sublarine ""Hegira"" and its US opponents are very enthralling. Unfortunately the good story loses much of its interest when the reader is introduced to ""Nagasaki"" torpedoes making 70 knots of speed with a range of 140 miles. These fictional weapons unravel the whole submarine thriller and make it look Hollywood-like."
3,"Good book, some problems.","After reading Phoenix Sub zero I found myself in a deja vu' situation. I have read Voyage of the Devilfish and this book seems a little bit like it. It has a good plot and a believable scenario but it threads together like Devilfish. A hunt for a super-sub. A super torpedo, both boats blowing up.I am hoping for a turn around with Barracuda Final Bearing the next book in the Pacino saga"
1,Worst after taste of any protein bar,"Can't understand how so many people like this bar. I have been eating different protein bars for well over 20 years now and every detour bar I have ever tried, I ended up throwing away. An absolute horrible, artificial after taste is what greets you every time you bite into one. If you truly value good taste, do not waste your money on these bars. There are much better choices out there."
2,Low Sugar- High in After taste,"I bought the Caramel Peanut, Peanut Butter cream and choco chip caramel combo from Costco and I figured Ill give these a shot since they have lower calories than the Apex FIT Bar I am currently eating.I really regret buying this in bulk because I thought when they meant lower in sugar that it wasnt really going to be that sweet. Oh boy was I wrong, this bar is loaded with that ""artificial sugar"" that it makes it super sweet and it comes with that not so gratifying after taste. Im usually not the sensitive type when it comes to taste. In fact I could tolerate a lot of ""bad taste"" but this one is pretty. Just FYI, these artificial splenda type of sugar might decrease the calorie and sugar amount but it doesnt mean its the best for you either."
5,"Good Taste, Tons of Protien","If you are looking to boost your Protein intake this a great way to do so. The bars are tasty and if you follow the directions you will not have any issues with shipping. I caution you this though. Watch your protein intake. After arming myself with knowledge I know realize that I am consuming way more protein than I should. If you need more protein, this is an easy way to get it, just make sure you need that extra protein."
2,Garbage,"Yes it tastes good because it is nothing but a chemically engineered candy bar- check ingredients, high fructose corn syrup, sucralose, etc, etc- you are being fooled into thinking it is good for you, or healthy, because of the nutritional stats of low carb, no sugar, and high protein but this is a chemical candy bar- check out www.thinkproducts.com for natural, sugar free, high protein- I do not work for them."
1,Detour Caramel Peanut,Probably the worst meal replacement/supplementI've ever tasted. Huge after-taste and don'tforget NON-RETURNABLE - even after one bar.Not only do they test terrible but researchis now showing that high peanut content foodscause skin problems.My skin cleared up overnight after eliminatingall peanut based products from my diet.Look for a bar that offers digestive enzymesand all the right kind of protein your body needs.We live and learn
1,Tastes awful,"I tried this brand of protein bars and they're awful. They leave a terrible taste in your mouth. Luna protein bars are WAY, WAY better. They have a few grams more sugar but I'd rather enjoy what I'm eating than choke down one of these just to get some protein."
5,Excellent Protein Bar,"Generally speaking, I'm not real big on protein and/or energy bars - they tend to have a lot of carbs and sugar. However, I really like these bars - they are low sugar and contain good quality protein. I definitely do not eat protein bars every day, but these are an excellent source of decent nutrition and/or additional protein when you need/want it."
5,A Great Buy!,"Most protein bars either taste good but have poor digestibility or digest well but taste bad. This bar seems to have the best of both worlds, great taste and pretty good digestibility. If you don't believe me just read the label and the first three ingredients are whey protein concentrate, whey protein isolate, and hydrolyzed whey protein. Ideally when buying any whey protein you want whey isolate or hydrolyzed whey as your first ingredients but Detour some how got the formula right and there to be not too much whey protein concentrate to affect a lactose intolerant such as myself. I can go on and on about whey protein instead you can read more at:[...]"
1,"If I could give this bar zero stars, I would","I'm on a low-carb, low-sugar diet and have found many bars that are tasty and fit within my requirements. In fact, there aren't many bars that I dislike; ask my husband -- I'll eat just about anything! But this bar is absolutely Horrible tasting. I ate one and thought I was just being picky, so I waited a few days and ate another; I had to force myself to finish it. I also noticed that for about 3 hours afterwards, I'm a bit nauseous. Just gross. I wish I could send them back, as I bought a box of 12..."
5,Solid,"Solid Jabsco impeller. Brought my old bilge pump back to life. Shipping was fast, product was as advertised. I'll order another as a backup."
1,Disappointing,"Mr. Clark seems like a high energy, innovative soul who genuinely cares for his students. The workbook, however, is disappointing. It is mostly a compilation of busy work exercises. One particular multiple-choice activity directs students to match a person with something he or she may have dropped. I feel certain Mr. Clark's own role-playing activities (mentioned in his book The Essential 55) hold far more meaning and value for students. Mr. Clark might better serve parents and teachers by providing suggestions, scenarios, and guidelines for managing those more memorable experiences."
4,The Essential 55 Workbook,"I have not finished this book yet. However, I think it is excellent for all teachers that teach allage groups. It is great for teaching social skills, manners and respect for self and others."
3,Haunting Thunderstorm,"I think this CD is really cool. The haunting melodies makes it seem like your in one of those mistery books. But some people might not like it because it has music. If your one of those ""i like nature cd's with out music"" then this cd isn't for you. If you like nature cd's with music, and with out then get this cd. My favorite song is the very first one. I like it alot. But I got the 3 volume collection of this one. The first one was with haunting melodies, the second with piano, and the third one with out music. The 3 volume collection was my very first nature cd. That's what got me into collecting all kinds of them. Also check out the Relax with series, there really good too."
3,Incomplete,"What's a Best Of The Ventures cd doing WITHOUT ""Apache,"" ""Telstar,"" ""Secret Agent Man,"" and ""Out of Limits""??? There are even a few others missing that I could mention that deserve to be on here.This is one of the most important bands of all-time and they deserve a better song selection than this for their ""official"" best-of."
2,Nothing like it looks,"Pictures speak louder than words... And this knob is nothing like it. I thought it was a solid circle. It looks like the AT&T logo but instead of filler in between the stripe ""white"" there is nothing there.. so it razors ur hand whilr u drive. Other than that, its great! ;/"
1,CHEAP TOWELS,"I am sure glad I didn't pay $15 for these towels. I got them for $7.99 with a free hand towel, and they aren't even worth that much. Some of the loops looked like they had been snagged on something when I received them, I washed the towels and they have fuzz balls everywhere. The edges on some of the towls have came unstitched and are all fraid after only the 2nd wash. I would NEVER ever buy these towels again. No way are they 100% cotton and worth more then $2 a piece. These are junk towels I would use in my dogs crate."
3,It's OK,"Nothing great about these. I'll say just OK. I bought white ones, and would not suggest to buy them. Buy other colors."
2,Very thin for a name brand towel :-(,"I bought these towels to wash my car, so I wanted a thick soft 100% cotton nap. What I received was on par with the thin towels you'd find at cheap hotel - not thick or soft. On the plus side, the sewed in tag did say 100% cotton and it was made in the USA."
1,Horrible Kindle edition,"I'm not rating Drabble's novel. I think it's a regular Drabble novel, fully representative of her style. But the edition I read - the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt edition to Kindle devices - is an unacceptable one. It's full of errors. There is a lot of sentences with no punctuation. There is a lot of misspelling words - ""Creek"" instead of ""Greek"", ""Erst"" instead of ""first"" and so on. I think there isn't a single page without mistakes. It's annoying. It seems an amateurish scanning, using a bad OCR software. I am asking Amazon to exchange this terrible edition for the Penguin edition, which I hope it's better."
5,Great Zoom Camera!!!,"This great camera may be small, but it's packed with great features!The zoom lens is terrific. While I was at my cousin's concert, I could see them up close without moving an inch! Believe me, going from 38mm to 115mm is a long way. I also love the all of the modes. The flash modes are: Auto flash, auto flash with red eye reduction, day-light sync (fill-in flash), slow shutter flash off mode (it uses natural light where flash is not advised), and slow shutter with flash and red eye reduction. The other modes are Infinity landscape mode and self timer (10 sec.) For the price, this is a great camera!"
3,Pentax Made a Better Camera 15 years Ago,"Just got it, haven't finished a roll for slides to send in, so have no idea how good it is for taking pictures. Don't like it as well as my old Pentax that ""died"". Shutter release is stiff, needs force to push down. View finder is smaller so harder to see what you are taking a pictue of. And worst, if you want the red eye elemination feature, you have to set it EVERY time. The old one, once it was set it stayed that way when you turned off the camera."
2,Not a good camera,"I received this camera from my husband as a gift right before our son was born. What a mistake this purchase was. It is large and bulky, but the worst thing is that the picture quality is very unpredictable. Some photos turn out ok, others are just awful. The zoom lens almost always takes fuzzy pictures. This is NOT operator error - I have had other cameras and never had problems like this. I also HATE that the camera pauses for a full second when you hit the shutter button before the photo actually takes. When you have small children, their smiles are unpredictable and I've missed too many great shots because this camera paused for too long. I'm going to get rid of this one and buy myself an Olympus Stylus. My advice is to stay away from this one."
1,I don't like it.,"I think that anyone who tries to discredit people or beliefs should be discredited. First of all, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but, at the same time, should also get criticized if that person doesn't know what he is talking about. Gordon seems to come from a religious background and it shows in his book."
1,this book is boring,"I think this book is nonsence.how can anyone say that other peoples beliefs don't count for anything.Everyone should be allowed to believe in what they want to believe.personally , i am a great believer in shirley maclaines beliefs and i'm sure alot of people feel the same way. I don't really think anyone is in the position to give any negative comments on the beliefs featured in this book."
4,Incredible India..!,"A country the size of the continent, home to a sixth of humanity. An ancient civilization, a modern democratic republic, a nation that is several countries in one. India- collosal and inexplicably diverse."
2,A big disappointment,"Ear buds that don't stay in my ears! The sound quality is wonderful, but the buds have no padding or foam around them, so they don't conform to the shape of your ear. I can't find a comfortable position and can't get them to stay in even when I simply turn my head from side to side. Add to this the fact that the cord to one ear is a good eight inches longer than the other one (is there some sort of reason for this I'm just not smart enough to appreciate?!!)...Great sound but an extremely frustrating product."
5,A wonderful tribute to this special relationship,What a beautiful book filled with loving actual stories about the relationship that each family shares. I remember thinking that my grandmother loved me best of all her grandchildren. I can still remember how she would throw a bag of cookies out of her window when I would play outside her house..Today too much emphasis is spent on youth and this book makes us remember how impt. our grandparents are . The love that they give is totally unconditional. My daughter told my mother secrets that shocked me but my mother listened and never judged. She and my daughter shared moments that will live on thru my daughter now that my mom has passed away.I look forward to the day that I can love and be a friend to my grandchilren. These stories certainly have shown me the way. This book is a definite purchase for everyone! I throughly enjoyed every page and will reread forever. A. Richman
1,"Rip off of Queen/David Bowie's ""Under Pressure""","The only reason this piece of garbage singer is known at all is because he stole a beat, sound for sound, from a song written by Queen and David Bowie. If you listen to them both you will hear the exact same thing. AND WHAT DO YA KNOW! Queen and David Bowie were around long before this joke!"
1,Here's A Story 'Bout My Homeboy Randy . . .,"...He was hooked on a girl named Candy. That's poetry at its finest, considering you're deaf, dumb, blind, and deformed. It's miraculous that I used to listen to this album religiously back in grade school and haven't thought about doing anything drastic to myself or the world in which I exist as a traumatic result! This CD gets a star, because it's hilarious to go driving around bumping Vanilla Ice out of your vehicle. The looks are priceless! So get yo' groove on, pimp daddy. Max and relax with yo' mind on yo' money and yo' money on yo' mind, playa! 'Cause Ice is back with a brand new invention! Definitely worth a star in my book - also worth a dollar (tops) just to play this in your car stereo in front of the honeys! Know what I'm sayin', G?"
2,I'm from Miami; me and Ice go way back,"Ice is the man. The G has style (see his movie COOL AS ICE). However, the real players are at: gumballwillie.com"
2,This is no classic - but it's good comedy,"I recently saw the Vanilla Ice opus 'Cool as Ice' on TV. I listened to his rhymes, his flow, etc. etc. He's not awful, but he didn't break any new ground musically. Pick up a copy of 'Long Live the Kane' by Big Daddy Kane (recorded two years earlier than To the Extreme) and you can see EXACTLY where he got his musical inspiration from. Like I said though, his stuff is good comedy. Seeing a white boy in a ""Down By Law"" leather jacket, talking like a homeboy and claiming that he's killing the competition (i.e. sucker MCs) is good for a laugh. But come on, people - unless you think you're being really cool and ironic, there's no disputing the fact that Vanilla Ice is just a wannabe rapper."
1,The soundtrack to my preteen summers.,"Sure, he was a total poseur and he forever ruined the image of the white rapper. But has anyone since had the guts to try and fill his shoes? Not unless they hide behind clown makeup. You know that you own this album. Dust it off and relive those memories. Just for fun, put on your Oakleys, put the top down and blast this from your 5.0. You'll get more looks than if you were palying Puff Daddy, that's for sure."
4,this is only the first not the last,This is not his best album but his evolution only gets better. So you cant hate him because you have no idea. So get a clue!
5,"A CLASSIC, LANDMARK ALBUM!","The world owes the Ice Man a tremendous debt; if not for Vanilla's breakthrough masterpiece, there never would have been an Eminem."
1,Vanilla Ice is hardcore,"Rob Van Winkle (aka Vanilla Ice) is totally hardcore. His street cred has been idisputable ever since he he busted out the dope lyrics ""Go ninja, go ninja, go!"" in that second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. To all y'all wack fools who be listenin' to other hip-hop, I'll qoute Vanilla himself (from his blockbuster film Cool As Ice): drop that zero and get with the hero. Word to your mother."
1,wack wack baby,"with this album Vanilla Ice humiliated a whole generation of white people in the hip hop game, only is it now with dope white mcs like Eminem and mr Eon are we getting some respect.This album should be comdemed to hell."
1,Give the black man back his music.,"Vanilla Ice is a theif. White people have already stole one type of music from black people and that was rock and roll. Yes Rock was started by a man named Chuck Berry. Look into it. Vanilla Ice stole the music and his best song is stolen. Everyone who hears the beat at the start of Ice Ice Baby instinley thinks David Bowie and Queen but when you hear the white guy trying to rap your like ""WTF!!!"". Dont buy this album. No in fact buy it and burn it so you would've stopped some one from buying this piece of crap."
2,What a disgrace.,"I like rap music, I'm 13 years old, and I'm white. Vanilla Ice deeply hurt the future of white hip-hop. Right now, there's Eminem, and that's about it. I gave this album 2 stars because even I'll admit that ""Ice Ice Baby"" is a cool song (of course he stole the beat for it from David Bowie and Queen). The rest of the album though is frankly, well, BAD. Plus, after this album, did you ever hear anything about Vanilla Ice again other that Behind the Music on VH1? If you said yes, you're living in a fantasy world. In conclusion, I don't regret that I bought this cd because every once in a while I'll put ""Ice Ice Baby"" on for a listen, but if you don't like that song, I wouldn't even think of reccomending this album to you."
4,Be reasonable...,"I have the cassette from somtime around '93-'94, and it used to be my favorite thing to listen to. Now I listen to everything atleast once to be open minded, but Eminem is the WORST rapper of all time. Whether or not Vanilla Ice pirated his bass from Queen doesn't matter. All that matters is what the music sounds like to the listener. If you like the sound, great, if you don't, well, who really cares either way? Now for somthing more closely related: Good album, 4 stars."
2,To The Extreme Review,"I really don't know what to think, but one song does stand out, like a sore thumb, that is, and that's none other than that cult classic song ""I Love You"". Take it from me Iceman, there is no way you can rap a love song and to even try means you have probably have got balls the size of grapefruits. The first time I heard it, I cracked up with laughter, and even now. Another song I don't get is, ""Having A Roni"", try to explain that to me. Also that one song, ""Ice Is Workin' It"", exactly what is Ice workin'? The only song worth a listen is ""Ice Ice Baby"". But if I were you, I wouldn't even buy it."
1,corny in 90 corny in 00,the guy was a good dancer but that has nothing to do with rapping on the mic or lyrics.this album was pure marketing.he is the Al Jolsen of Rap.making a mockery of it as to bringing something important to the game.he couldn't even get his samples right.Ice Ice baby bit a Queen/David Bowie cut.this is very corny pure&simple.
1,To The Dumpster,"Vanilla Ice is possibly the saddest excuse for an MC. His lyrics and beats made hip-hop blush and many from then on took hip-hop for a joke. Thanks Vanilla for making a mokery of hip-hop culture. Trust me, this CD is trash and before you let Mr. Ice give you have a false perception of hip-hop, pick up some Beastie Boys, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, The Roots, etc. If you buy this album, let it be for destructive purposes. Or better yet, use it as a frisbee, paperweight, or a coaster."
1,F*** Vanilla Ice,Screw Vanilla for dissing Q-tip. He did it when he was famous and Q-tip wasnt yet. Now look whos a rap legend and whos the laughing stock of hip hop heads every where.
1,this does'nt even desirve 1 star,all u ppl that were sying he is good and one of best must b smokin somthin. This is the wackest thing i ever head. I cant believe ppl actually like this crap. what a discrace to old school hip-hop.
2,It was okay,"A few good songs, but overall very boring, and i haven't listened to it in atleast a month, it isn't good enough to listen to over and over again, like a great cd is."
3,This is Crazy People,"I can't believe the way you guys are acting over Vanilla Ice.Give the guy a break.This was all an image that he didn't want to precieved as but when money offers are thrown in your face you'll go with it.Don't act like you didn't like this when he came out,it's because of the people in which had the success so don't act like you hated it.I read one review saying how Vanilla Ice ruined your life.Thats crazy.How did he ruined your life.Vanilla Ice has nothing to do with that,Vanilla Ice,Eminem,or no other rapper will change the opinions of what people think about you,thats crazy seriously.Anyway if this album is a piece of crap then why it was so successful,people grow up and let's be honest.He suffered a lot of hardship and you're not making it any easier for him,give the guy a break and let him do is thing."
2,Talk about a one hit wonder,Vanilla Ice is wack so let's get that out of the way early. This album has bad production and lyrically one of the worse CD's ever released. Vanilla Ice almost single handedly closed the door for future white artist. What a shame!
2,There still hope,"he made some killer hits which everyone loves, but he is still and will always be a classic."
1,I hate rappers like this!,"Listen up, this is poser music, just like Avril and Good Charlotte. Anybody who thinks this guy is great needs to get this through their stupid thick heads: listen to some good music. If you listen to this then you obviously have bad taste in music. Listen to Opeth, since their music is art and they're not trying to make people think they look cool if they listen to them. I'm not going to listen to some poser rapper who ripped off a Queens song."
1,VANILLA ICE IS THE REASON I'M UNPOPULAR!,I HATE YOU!I HATE YOU!I HATE YOU!I HATE YOU!I HATE YOU!I WANNA BE FAMOUS!WHY CAN'T I BE FAMOUS!EVERYBODY TEASES ME!EVERYBODY CALLS ME MIKE THE DYKE!I HATE YOU!I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME NOT TO WATCH T.V!THANKS A LOT VANNILA ICE!YOU RUINED MY LIFE!(...)
1,Use this as a mirror,"Mr. Van Winkie (or Mr. Ice, if that makes you feel better) you should be proud of yourself. Fifteen years of writing garbage and you still have ""fans"" (I think they have been in comas since 1990.) ""Ice Ice Baby"" was voted #5 on VH1's Awesomely bad songs. Why is that? Oh right, because you blatantly stole Queen's song. White people cannot rap, and no I will not except Eminem because I know the roots of rap and Mr. Mathers is only a few steps above good ol' Rob Van Winkle. You have completely failed in your music and movie career (Look up reviews for the movie Cool As Ice.) Shling-a-shlong, bud."
1,UH!!!,"I thought Queen had something here. I think Queen and David Bowie had Under Pressure. Then you here ""V.I.P.!!!"" It's like shut the **** up! Vanilla Ice was a horrible rapper. The only good white rapper is Eminem. Vanilla Ice, I'm glad you aren't in the music industry anymore! Actually, you should be glad because you would be getting your ass kicked out on the streets. Oh yeah, YOUR STUPID SONG ICE ICE BABY IS THE #6 WORST SONG EVER ACCORDING TO VH1!!!"
1,Were all of you dropped on your heads when you were young?,"Okay, look, it is important to note that just because someone is white it does not mean they can't rhyme, but the unfortunate truth is all good white rappers that I know are not pro and never will be. They hang out a poetry readings and such and that is what rap should be about. You people need to realize that rap and hip hop have their roots in poetry. It is a beautiful art form if exacted correctly, but Vanilla Ice is just plain awful. He obviously does not get that music should mean something, it should not be a bunch of self praising [stuff], like what this product is. If you want some good rap go for the following artists: The Fugees, Wyclef Jean, The Roots and Spearhead, but please just stay away from Vanilla Ice."
1,ABOLUTE F**^^*****ING S***IT,WHAT A WANNABE . A DISGRACE TO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. THIS IS NOT MUSIC. THIS IS GARBAGE
1,real rap NOT!,I should not have to explain this album to you to make it that you dont buy this cd. lets just put it this way. THIS IS VERY CORNY AND HORRIBLE RAP!
1,Only liked this when I was a dumb teen!,"We all know about this guy ripping off David Bowie.. Butthat's not the only problem! When you realize how fakeand New Kids on the Block like he is you will be unableto take this album seriousally. I really can't believeI listened to this as a teen. There is not a worthy trackon this entire piece of crap. ""Having a Roni"" has to beabout the worst song I have ever heard. Truely pathetic!"
5,VANILLA WRECKS SHOP!,WE ALL HAVE SAID THAT VANILLA ICE IS OUT. BUT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO HIS FUNKY TRACKS YOU CAN FEEL THE RYTHEM AND THE RHYMES PULSATING THROUGH YOUR SOUL! ALL THE SUDDEN YOUR HEAD START BOBBING AND YOU ARE LIP SYNCING ICE ICE BABY! YEAH YOU KNOW!
1,ICE is the Street Name for POLICE,Many of his songs were viewed as PROMOTING INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE and HARASSMENT in areas where he PERFORMED.OFFICERS WERE TOLD TO ATTEND HIS SHOWS. DISCUSS THIS WITH LATINOS OVER AGE 60 for ADDITIONAL ACURATE information.
4,A book for presenters,I think this is a good book for persons interested to know how make a good presentation. My special interest it's learn a good method to write and speak a better english and improve my communication.
1,Disappointed,"The charger was the only thing in this bundle that was good. I kept it only because the charger alone was worth the cost. The case was very well made, but a very poor fit for my Blackberry, which it was made for...once I managed to squeeze it into the case, the case won't close, so it's useless."
4,Gforce 7900 GTX,The card runs great! I paid a lot for next day delivery and got the package in 3 days! Very dissapointed with amazon and ups delivery system.
5,Magnificent. Ab-so-lutely magnifique!,"This pad really, truly softens my stool--that's why I bought 2. Before they arrived my stools were astoundingly hard. I hated them. They were so hard that when they arrived it even hurt getting them out. While beautiful, the stools were bumpy and rough. Sitting down for breakfast was like torture: leaning over I would wince and yelp just trying to move my bowls. Bowl movement was nearly impossible before these stool softeners arrived. Now my bowl movements don't hurt at all! I can easily move bowls full of cereal or even corn thanks to these stool softeners. The light brown color is also a plus--my formerly all brown stools have really been brightened up. All in all, if you need to soften your stools and you value quality, these are absolutely the stool softeners for you!"
5,CLINT HEYLIN SAYS THIS ALBUM SAVED RICHARDS LIFE,"Moondog Matinee is a one ld/cd of 1950s? covers that takes US BACK to their bar band as ""The Hawks""...toronto 1959?when they played bars .The band is getting along in the studio....perhaps unlike CAHOOTS and STAGEFRIGHT as they cover ""Ain't Got No Home"", ""Mystery Train"", ""The Promised Land"", ""The Great Pretender"" ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" as well as others.I only wish they had expanded on this by doing a second 2 record studio set and then a live box set!!!!!!!Bob Christgau has called this THE GREATEST COVERS LP !!!!!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.......UNFORTUNALELY THEY WALTZED THEMSELVES INTO NEAR OBLIVION...a few years later.{..excepting RR who 'took care of biz' and did lots of films and interviews}....sad that as the original set up after this they had only a few studio albums left......and they were still fairly young..."
5,"PANNED IN 73, FORTY YEARS LATTER STILL GOING STRONG","ALWAYS WAS FASCINATED WITH THIS LP ,WITH SOME ADDED TRACKS JUST HAD TO ANTI UP (WELL WORTH IT) AND AS TIGHT AND FUNKY AS IT USE TO BE ,THE REMASTER PUTS MORE FROSTING ON THE CAKE"
5,The best CD collection I have.,I have listened to this hundreds of times. Serenity series gives me great meditation sittings and excellent peace time.I recommend this to everybody.
1,Pompous bull,"I must confess that I am not the type of person who is per se a fan of the meditational genre. I tried hard to like this piece of art which is undoubtedly is, but it is definitely not the right choice for a birthing room. 39 minutes is far too long. But my opinion isn't necessarily the only true one out there. Yeppers or nopers."
3,Building College Vocab.,I paid for next day shipping and received it late. Other than receiving the product late I was satisfied.
5,"weak voices, great voices","I think this song is so delicate that listening to it could change your mood permanently. The way Isobel sings is very intense, although it may sound weak, but this is what makes them unique, just as other female singers that I recommend: Astrud Gilberto, Franoise Hardy, and even a group from Spain, known as ""La Buena Vida""."
5,Nice Song-Falling From Grace,"Falling from Grace is a nice song.This song believe it was played in the movieswimfan or swimfan85. But fallingfrom grace was never in that motion picturealbum becausethis song""falling from grace"" was in another motion picturesoundtrack, a movie that starred christina ricci. But Falling from Graceis a nice song, so i recommend that one purchasesthe single. It is worth it."
2,Useful adjectives?,"I thought the messages in this book were mostly negative. There were several helpful phrases, but I would NEVER use adjectives such as ""antisocial, tense, overcritical, impertinent, quarrelsome, resentful, or nervous"" to describe a student. They sound very judgmental and can be worded differently to get the point across. I also felt most of the phrases in each category - ""academic achievement"" for example, were negative comments... ex: ""fails to, never, sacrifices, needs to, makes mistakes, is confused about, has difficulty, doesn't always, is inconsistent, would improve if...""I may be wrong, but I would appreciate more POSITIVE academic/behavior comments as most of my students are doing well."
5,Full House: complete seasons 1 and 2,"I love this show and was very disappointed when I couldn't watch all of season 2. I received two replacements and they were all bad. I hope the DVD company can get good, new ones made soon. It's a great show."
4,Doggie Bowls,These bowls are very cute. You can't beat their prices also. I do wish that they were a little larger though.
2,Nice but..,The bowl itself is very nice and the name plate is right but it is much much smaller than I could have ever dreamed. We actually didn't even get to use it because our dog was just too big for it.
4,John Locke's Second Treatise of Government1,"Locke presents the reader with a substantial amount of information about his views on human law and the laws of nature. It is an extremely intense, but a very interesting read. I would not have read this book, if it weren't for my political philosophy class, but I am extremely glad that I did because I now have a better understanding of our government, and more importantly of the laws of human nature."
3,Film not bad; transfer to disc excellent,"The production values in this film are very high; the special FX good and the sets and costumes quite opulent. Although the antics of the 3 Stooges are (thankfully) toned down, I would have appreciated a more ""straight"" retelling of this beloved fairy tale -- that is, with 7 dwarfs. Although Carol Heiss cannot act, Patricia Medina is very good as the Queen/Witch, as is Guy Rolfe as Count Oga, her wicked partner-in-crime. NOW...as to the DVD: 20th Century Fox Home Video did a great job with the transfer of the film to disc: the colours are vibrant, the image crisp, and the print free of artifacts. It was very nice to see this old favourite in the widescreen format for the first time.Stephen Clothier"
3,Snow white is listed first for a reason,"This is a charming little film with a charming little plot and the stooges providing comic relief. They provide it well and show they can act a bit too. The other performances are not history making and aren't meant to be. It is an entertaining movie and much to my surprise one of my kids favorites, I find myself partial to it myself but I can't seem to explain why. That is likely the reason for mearly three stars.The big mistake here is to think of this as a stooges movie. It belongs in any stooges collection for its historical value but It is not a true three stooges movie as The Three Stooges Meet Hercules. If you are looking for stooges, stooges, stooges you will not be happy. If you want a cute film that CONTAINS the stooges in a supporting role, you'll like it."
2,Not the best Three Stooges Movie,"How can you go wrong with the Three Stooges?I am a Three Stooges fan from way back and I have to admit this is not the best of their movies. The Three Stooges (Moe, Larry, and Curly Joe) stand in for the Dwarfs (the boys are house-sitting for them while they are away), Carol Heiss (1960 Olympic skating champion) is Snow White and the setting is in the fairy tale of castles and forests. You will still be pleased with a pie in the face but there is not a whole lot of other slapstick.The plot is essentially the same as the fairy tale. The Stooges are substitutes for the vacationing Dwarfs, and responsible for uniting Snow White with her Prince. The Prince has grown up with the Stooges, who have a traveling medicine show, when they rescued him from an assassination attempt engineered by Snow White's stepmother, the Queen."
5,Should be a perennial favorite in every family's collection!,"This is a beautifully filmed fairy tale with the added attraction of Carol Heiss' fabulous skating talent, and a delightful musical score. Good is just OH-SO-VERRY-VERRY-GOOD, and BAD is TOTALLY-DELIGHTFULLY-DELICIOUSLY-EVIL as only Disneyesque fairy tails can demonstrate. The added bonus of the beloved THREE STOOGES makes this a grand jem of family fun!"
5,fantastic,"love this all time classic, I watched this as a kid and it stuck in my memory as a funny good movie and my memory was right"
1,errrrrr loser dont waste your time,"if I remember right this was their worst rated movie and their last. Its not a really a comedy it contains horrible acting,dumb music but the only thing that its good at is wasting your time."
4,Not your ordinary 3 stooge flick,"Ok, so lots are dissapointed that the 3 stooges dont slap themselves silly in this movie, but heck if you look at the whole,its pretty impressive. Nice sets, a know fairytale, great costumesgood music and our 3 wonderfull stooges. Fun to watch it as a kid,as much fun to watch it as a adult. So dont expect a great moviebut a fun movie."
2,Technicolor Stooges feature isn't too bright,"In the 1960's The Three Stooges were again in demand (they were unceremoniously fired by Columbia in 1959, never having received a raise) and this was their first color full-length feature. Opinion on this is somewhat divided; some believe that it's a trashing of a classic fairy tale, and others think the fairy tale itself overshadows the Stooges. Nonetheless, most (including myself) agree that this is a real snooze, with minimal slapstick and none of the beloved sound effects. The story stays true to the fairy tale, but the Stooges here are too tame to generate much interest."
2,Family veiwing,"Skating in this film was a real life experience. However, much of the skating was cut from this film so you must enjoy the comedy of the Three Stooges which is entertaining for the kids of all ages."
1,Snow White Milks Out The Three Stooges,"I was very anxious to watch this movie when I got the tape, but afterwards, I was very disappointed. This whole movie is a bore! The boys appear in just about 30% of the film, and even the scenes with them are dull. The boys act has been toned down to almost nothing just to it can be suitable for children. BIG MISTAKE!! The only use-of violence in this short is when Moe bops Curly-Joe on the head - that's it! One measly bop on the head, and even that looked fake.The first time I watched this when I got the tape for my birthday 2 years ago, I found myself fast forwarding through almost the whole movie, then the next day I promised myself I would watch the whole movie but ended up falling asleep after 3 minutes!"
2,A film the Stooges publically apologised for!,"Moe Howard called this film ""a technicolor mistake!"" while Larry Fine dismissed it as ""sad...I don't mean 'sad', I maen 'SAD!'"""
1,disappointing,"There are a lot of wonderful Christian films. This is not one. First, I was disappointed in the lack of Christian message (Jesus Christ is the way). Also, I try to instill ""the modesty"" issue in my girls. The main character often wore low cut tops that the camera seemed to be well aware of. There is a scene where the main character is sitting in her boss's home reading from the Bible. The camera shows the Bible and the girl's low-cut top. If you aren't one who cares about the whole modesty thing or you are accepting of today's fashion, then you won't have a problem with it. I just know that I have been showing my children movies where the girl's are still cool while dressing fashionably and over time, I have come to see that my girls want to dress modestly now and they hate anything low-cut or short-cut. Like I said, I know this isn't a issue for most; however, if this is an issue that God has been dealing with you and your family, then don't get this film."
1,Low budget film with poor acting,"I purchased this for my mother as a gift before viewing it myself,which I shouldn't have done. I thought since it was a Christian film she would enjoy it. She was extremely disappointed with it.I asked for it back and finally viewed it and saw why. The acting is not very believable, there are scenes where the main character is just walking with another character and there is no dialog. It's a bit choppy going from one scene to another. It doesn't feel like it flows very well. You feel like you are watching a home movie instead of a supposedly professionally made film.There are better made Christian films out there, so I would not waste money on this one."
2,Comercial and easy literature,"I considere this book as a comercial action. Etxeberría segmentate the market, found a rentable public ( women who never read nothing before ), and writte something deepless. There's no literature on this book, one can realize that it was only made for the money."
5,Contagious Inspiration!,"I take immense delight in reading anything by this author - and this book, the 3rd volume of his wonderful trilogy of ""Handbooks For The Soul"" is an homage to the pure heart of the writer found in the dialogue of a sundry array of works in film, stage, and literature. Mr. Newlove is in possession not only of an enviably keen eye and ear for the stuff that stirs the soul, but also with a passion for words further enhanced with an acquaintance with their power, so rarely discovered in literature. This is indeed a handbook for the soul - for it is wholly without academic babble - you will not find herein even a jot of instruction on the craft of writing, but rather a celebration of it ~~ And for any body who reads or writes for the shear and pure revelry of it, a celebration is all that could ever be desired!"
1,If these guys are inspired by black metal...,"...Then Metalica was watered down 80's pop. Come on now, what is this? I obviously was not ready for how bad this was when I saw one of their videos on Headbangers Ball(RIP). They sound like Underoath(Who I despise) was thrown into a blender with (Insert Emo Band here) and (Insert anything that has to do with Fred Durst here). The sound is so bland and so uninspired that I could write better songs about my nextdoor neighbors feces after chili day at lunch. Then of course, there is the outfits. Girls jeans and Misfits tees with a small button down shirt. Come on. This guy looks hilarious when he screams, at least Alexi Laiho looks and sounds cool when he does it. Don't buy this. In fact don't look at it. Pick up ""Are you dead yet?"", the new COB album, ""Undoing Ruin"" by Darkest Hour, and some Tool. MJK's boogers write better lyrics than this fool."
2,Hardcore + Nu-metal= Bad Idea,Dillanger is flat out a horrible band. They don't even know what music is and you should never by this because it's a waste of time and money. Dillanger wants to be phish but their singer is so stupid he thinks he's hard-core. The rest of the band is nu-metal and sound like a real fast version of creed/puddle of mud. Listen to Bjork of Frank Sinatra instead of this garbage.
2,This record sucks,"I'm really into metal and grindcore etc whatever scene name you want to call it . . .and I know DEP is highly respected in the circle, but this record sounds like new Burnt by the Sun on crack. And I know some of us would like something like that, so let me call this Burnt by the Sun On Crack... Gone Bad."
5,better than calculating infinity,"the day i bought this, i was scared dillinger had put out an album far less superior to calculating infinity. lots of reviewers on the internet had downloaded it and said they had sold out. yea, well, they suck, cuz they didn't. after the cd was over, i realized they had not only lived up to CI expectations, but far surpassed them. this album provides what you've come to love about dillinger, but with more added. the new vocalist, greg, is way better than dimitri. he has such more vocal range, this just sounds like what they should have sounded like in the first place. i little bit of the grind influence has left, but that doesn't change the fact that this cd is heavy as hell. a measuring stick for all other hardcore releases this year, buy now."
2,eeh....,"subpar performance from a once-great, cutting edge band. Calculating Infinity and Under the Running board are leaps and bounds above this mediocre album. I don't blame them for switching up their style and trying something different, but if you're looking for the DEP you're used to...this ain't it."
2,wonderful and horrible,"this album is hard for me to critique as it has my favorite and most despised DEP songs on it. Panosonic youth starts off by slapping you in the face out of nowhere and it doesn't let up from the first to the last downbeat. sunshine the werewolf has my all time favorite dillinger breakdown and there are a couple of songs that don't lag far behind. but unfortunately there are songs on this album like Unretrofied, The Perfect Design, and Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants which are all just god awful attempts at catchy chorus, ""reaching for a broader audience"" garbage. and it also doesn't help that greg puciato obviously tries to emulate trent reznor and mike patton on a couple of occasions. I didn't even like it when the real mike patton sang on this album's predecessor so to have someone else try to sound like him is just irritating. I'd give this one 2.5 stars if i could."
4,This isn't the same old DEP,"I love this album, it's a completely different DEP, obviously the lead singer was very heavily influenced by Mike Patton, but that's never a bad thing, in fact on this album it's a good thing. This album sounds like the second collaboration between Mike Patton and DEP, with the exception of unretrofied, and phone home, this album is fantasic. If it wasn't for those two tracks I'd give this 4 1/2 stars. buy it"
5,Mycyanide has no taste whatsoever because this CD is friggen awesome,Tool and darkest hour is good but let's face it the 90's are over and it's time for new music.this is the heavy metal music of today so mycyanide U have to be a complete C**k sucking pansey to despise Underoath and The Dillinger Escape Plan. This is THE heaviest CD I've listened to for a long time....it makes slipknot sound like slowdance music (no offense...slipknot is pretty heavy too).All the songs on this album are great and if you're looking for heavy metal music where they scream their butts off than this is the PERFECT CD for you and is a great addition to the family (of your heavy medal CD collection of course) so if you haven't heard this band give them a try and you won't regret it
1,letdown of the year,"i loved these guys when they were, uh, metal. now they're just lame, and for some reason are receiving a ridiculous amount of praise for a really boring album. this basically sounds like faith no more + nine inch nails, though the classic dep sound does make an appearance on track six. the rest of it's total radio crap. plus the lyrics are mighty banal. pick up the new pig destroyer or mastodon instead. relapse can still deliver the goods, this band cannot."
2,Musically Fantastic But...,"...new vocalist Greg P. is among the worst I have ever heard. A bad Mike Patton impression is all he can muster up. Shameless lack of vocal talent in both the screaming and singer areas.Please, get Dimitri back!"
1,Miss-es the mark,"More of the same relentless noisecore plus a cheesy nu-metal song minus Dimitri plus a third-class Mike Patton impersonator = Disappointment of the year. DEP should look to Radiation 4 and their 2003 album ""Wonderland"". They achieved what DEP were striving for but miserably failed with Miss Machine."
1,My Escape Plan,While listening to this was inevitable. I needed to come up with one to get away from its monsterous grasp. The noise was so intense I could barely move. Good thing I had enough strength to think up the plan and eventually break free.
2,Get this god awful contrasting out of my music,"Yet another disapointment just to sell a few more records. What do people see in these albums? All I hear about is the way they mixed hardcore with mainstream, what for? It's terrible. If I want mainstream, I'll listen to it.I've given up on DEP completely. Guess they'll never be able to reproduce the unrelenting hardcore and mastermind guitaring that was Calculating Infinity."
4,These guys have changed.,"Besides the obvious comparisons to former vocalists Mike Patton and Dmitri Minakakis, new DEP vocalist Greg Puciato has created a credible outing here with the (revamped?) Dillinger. I have to wonder about this a little-- the music has been simplified a great deal. This is not Calculating Infinity. But it is rather fascinating all the same, and I recommend it highly. I'm interested in seeing what these guys will do for a follow-up."
5,One of the Greatest CDs of all time...,"Why has nobody else reviewed this CD?The musicianship displayed here is astonishing, and the songs are amazing and just generally great. This is one of my favourite CDs, and I have a vast library, believe me!Highlights include: Sunshine The Werewolf, Van Damsel, Phone Home, We Are The Storm, Unretrofied, and The Perfect Design.For fans of metal in general, and anybody looking for something different."
1,Worthless,"These cards, and all Oxford cards that I have seen, are absolutely worthless. They are paper cut in rectangles. What's the point of having a card if it has no more weight than copy paper? I bought a pack and threw them right into the recycling bin. Went searching several different office supply stores to find a card with decent weight. All they carry are these Oxford cards. I had to order Mead cards from Amazon just to get something that works."
1,Heavy printing not useful,"I buy graph-printed index cards so I can use the graph-side (not the blank side) for writing on. Unfortunately, for some reason, Oxford has decided that the graph side is decorative only and now prints that side with so much ink that it's not possible to use it effectively as graph or careful-printing material. Instead of buying Oxford and returning it when it comes this way, I've switch brands."
2,Poorly written,"Although Gundry does well in this introductory book to give the reader pronunciation guides for names of persons, his syntax is incredibly poor. Because his sentence structure is lacking, his intended meaning is confusing and requires at times a multiple read in order to make sense of his sentence."
5,survey of the new testament 4th edition,it is a great book and it was like new when I got it thank you
3,As expected,"The item was exactly as described. Not brand new, but I didn't want one brand new. The book even arrived sooner than I expected. Great service."
5,Great Book,"An excellent book that sets out explains to the reader the history of the New Testament as well as carries on a dialogue with the text itself in which the book focuses on theology, major themes, and background for the reader to better understand the text. A fantastic feature of this book is that it contains many different points of view on the various subjects. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read an Orthodox survey of the New Testament."
3,For a book packed with so much info there is no index,I am a bit disappointed that the index of this book is three pages long. There is a ton of info but you can't access it easily unless you want to spend countless hours flipping pages or trying to practice your photographic memory skills. The Glossary of Pronunciations is longer!! I realize this is a textbook but I have read other textbooks on the New Testament that were easier to digest. I do like the end of chapter study guides and discussion but you get 5 stars on the snooze factor for the format.
3,Digital Version Is Poor,"Non-content based comment: There are a lot of typos with the digital format including some duplicate phrases and missing white space (this makes it hard to look at dictionary definition of some words). I'm trying to make notes of where they are in my clippings. Also the maps are not clear in digital format and are basically useless as a result. and this is the case for the tables too - the text is just way to hard to read. It is as if someone just pushed the ""digital"" version and never bothered to see if it converted successfully or proof read.As a result this is a case where the value of the digital version is a LOT less than the printed and therefore the digital version is too highly priced. Basically all the maps and tables are useless.I've only started reading the text but so far I find the content really useful and easy to read (except for the editing errors mentioned above).I may have to buy the hard cover printed version too. :("
4,Good but lacks things,"This study guide is definitely good, but it lacks things. It would be nice if the author would've provided the definitions of a lot of key terms and places. This guide also lacks a lot of dates which are in the textbook. Although, it does sum up each chapter of the textbook really well, it needs a lot more in it. Buy it if you wish, but you will be disappointed because of the lack of detail."
4,Informative and easy to digest,"This is a well formatted text book. While others tend to be overly ""wordy"", this book seems to have just the right amount of ""intellectual grammar."" Content is pertinent and relevant to the subject it presents. Good Job Gundry !!!"
5,Great Study Help,These map sheets seem to be very sturdy. The information is well laid out and it is easy to locate a particular site. I have found them very helpful and would recommend them for anyone who wants a better idea of how the maps of New Testament times relate to the maps of today.
4,Brief Review,"My class uses it as the main textbook. Overall, it's a good book. A big chunk in each chapter discusses the contents of each book in the New Testament, which is NOT what we want. But it's worth reading."
4,A Survey of the New Testament,Very good presentation of various viewpoints. Pictorial and written illustrations are outstanding. Occasionally the author's personal viewpoint is presented as an undisputed fact.
1,SAVE YOUR SAWBUCK!!!,"The information in this ""Book"" (More like a pamphlet) is so shallow and so simplistic that if I were to compare it to a book on weather it would read something like this.... ""When it rains, a good way to stay dry is to use an umbrella or, don't go outside.""If you want to help your orginizations fund raising efforts... Send them the [money] you would have spent on this book."
3,Handy tips,"This book has 25 good tips for fundraising (oriented toward campaigns and non-profits). There's nothing brilliant in here, but I learned a few new tricks.It's also a quick read, no non-sense..."
2,Not for everyone,"This book is very heavily geared towards political campaign fundraising, even though it says it applies to everyone. In each little chapter, the last paragraph usually says ""And this will also apply to non profit organizations"", and that's it. Some of the tips you really have to think out of the box to understand how. The authors I'm afraid are not writers, and whoever proofread the book missed quite a few errors. The font is huge and the paragraphs all have 2 spaces between them to make the book look larger, but mostly this makes you feel like you've wasted your money on what should be a pamphlet.In a nutshell, the best fundraising advice would be to put this money towards a more professional book, all of this is pretty much common sense."
2,Shallow and not worth the money!,"First of all, I don't think that this item deserves to be called a book, because this less-than-one-hour-reading is more like a pamphlet, with 25 ideas meant to help you to become better at fundraising. The problem is that these ideas are not new and most of them have been used by anyone, except for two or three of these which seemed a bit more interesting. Apart from that, it is 90% directed to political campaigns and it's almost completely useless for any charity or non-profit organization. Generally, these ideas are not very useful anyway and all these positive reviews here really make me think that they've been written either by the authors themselves or by someone who actually has no clue about fundraising at all. I consider that this ""book""'s price is too high for what you get, so you better keep looking for something better and more substantial."
1,There are better guides,"While I had high hopes for this guidebook, I found it a bit topical and overgeneral. Nonprofit organizations would do better to invest in a more thorough, professional introductory guide to the topic of fundraising."
1,False Advertisement!!!!!!,"My boyfriend saw these KSWISS Albury Ii Mens shoes and liked what he saw. However, they showed two different shoes. When you search for this shoe, it brings up a white shoe, but when you click on the link to select your size and buy the shoe, it shows a totally different shoe. What is shown has dark gray on the side around the toes, a red emblem of Kswiss, yellow/gold on the bottom of the shoe and dark gray on the tongue of the shoe. When I got it in the mail, it was a white shoe. I called amazon and explained. They appoligized and said they would take the incorrect picture down. Shoe buy said they dont have the shoe shown and that it may have been a older version of the shoe that kswiss no longer sells. I am returning. I was very dissapointed and I doubt if I'll buy Kswiss again."
2,not in use,this wasn'ta good purchase. the skewed design made it feel like a big watch and it was constantly trying to prevent full flexibility of my hand backwards. it ended up breaking the pins. shame a sport watch to be cumbersome
2,difficult,"This was too fast for a beginner, he said a word and then repeated and moved to the next, but very fast. I was not able to use it at all"
5,Fun show!,"Saw this in LA. It's a musical that's fun even for people who don't like musicals. It's hip enough to poke fun at the inherent silliness of musical theatre (""Dead Old Man""), but earnest enough to feature characters that you really care about. I love the moment when Reefer Madam Mae (the most co-dependent musical theatre heroine since Nancy in ""Oliver"") finds the courage to turn on evil Reefer pusher Jack and beat him to death with a garden hoe (""You once had all the brains/Now they're just carpet stains/'Cuz there's blood upon your necktie/Your corpus is delecti""). The CD music is even better than the live show, with some of the arrangements fattened up in the studio. Bonus track ""Weather Changes"" is one GORGEOUS ballad. I recommend this CD highly."
4,"Cooky, fun, but there's something missing........","Reefer Madness has the potential for being one of the greatest cult musicals ever... so why isn't it?Well it's just too bad it opened in the same year of other ""cult"" musicals: Rocky Horror Show, Bat Boy, and Urinetown. Reefer Madness just wasn't a stand-out! All had crazy titles, fun themes, unusual and fun music, and wonderful casts!But Reefer Madness lacks something. It doesn't have Rocky's sex appeal or an already exhisting cult following. It doesn't have Bat Boy's incredible inventiveness, or Urinetown's musical complexity.But it nevertheless is fun and worth buying for anyone who's a fan of musicals like Urinetown, and Bat Boy."
5,december birthstone barbie,"beautiful detail, display package makes easy viewing without having to remove from box. colors are crisp and sharp, my granddaughter loved this for her 11th birthday."
2,Dissapointing,"Whilst the author had unprecedented access to an entire course as aviators earned their Test Pilot certification, i was really dissapointed by the very vague nature in which the book actually details 'flying on the edge'. With the exception of 2 -3 chapters there is very little detail behind the actual flying part of the course. Their exists even less detail on the thory and the author does not even go to the trouble of actually informing the reader of what the course elements are. There is little detail on rotary wing operations also.I wanted to read about test flying and test pilots. Instead the author provides mere glimpses of the flying and seems happier to discuss the politics of test flying and the Navy - he gives a whole chapter to the Tailhook scandal which has nothing to do with 'flying the edge' in my opinion.If you want hard core flying and test flying action look somewhere else"
1,Pilots beware,"There is no point in discussing the many problems with this book in any depth, because one would have to write a book about them. Suffice it to say that Wilson, clearly a non pilot, had all the benefits of access based on his position and made the least of them. Readers who are interested in finding out more about Naval Aviation and its inner truths should read Paul Gillcrist's terrific FEET WET, and his follow-on VULTURE'S ROW. 'Gator' is the real thing, a PAX graduate and immensely experienced in the cockpit, from piston-engined aircraft of the '50s to the F-14, and his books are everthing that EDGE isn't.It's not a matter of 'close, but no cigar.' EDGE isn't even close. Sorry, Wilson, no sale (anyone want my copy, which is being used alternately as a coffee-mug coaster and door stop?)."
4,Good if you have a brain (Unlike myself),"This cd is much more subtle than their last few records, the lyrics are probably better but they mention a lot of stuff I'm sure most people have never heard of (I still have no clue what cointel pro is), but it's by propagandhi so you pretty much can't go wrong right?"
2,They're ok i guess,"Propagandhi are'nt that bad a band really they just drive me a bit insane at times you know it happens, the band does raise some important issues and it's good that they actually know what they are talking about i also like the fact that they raise the points of Noam Chomsky so thats why im giving them two stars and not one for the points that they raise and the issues they have brought up but the music does'nt really get to me like most the punk rock i hear. The style in which propagandhi play does'nt really get to me but if you like that then this will be a 5 star release from your perspective."
2,The Hosers have left the building,"The only reason I wasn't hugely disappointed in this album is that I had already heard it wasn't that good. Loyalty to the band and my love of their previous albums prompted me to get this one, but what happened? Their last full length, Less Talk More Rock is a masterpiece collection of songs that fit all together and rocked your ass off while giving you a great message at the same time. It doesn't sound like they're putting the same heart and soul into this record as their previous ones. Bottom line, the album is boring to listen to."
2,Pretty much not good.,"Probably thier worst album, though I don't know if I have heard all of them. The guitar riffs, vocals and tempo are constantly clashing which makes for a bad listening experience."
5,Great political music,"I've never heard Propagandhi before I got into punk, so I can't compare this to any of their other releases. This is awesome. Propagandhi is the Rage Against the Machine of punk. There's no other way to describe them. They're more outspoken in their lyrics than Rage is. Rage, for the most part keeps their music and politics sepereate (unless there's hidden messages in their music I'm not aware of). But I really liked this CD. The only song I didn't quite get was With Friends Like These, Who The F*** needs Cointelpro? But most of the songs are really good. The best are the hard intro, Mate Ka Moris Ukun Rasik An, the title track, Ordinary People Do F***ed Up Things, and Back to The Motor league (primarily because it has a diss on both Em and Fred Durst). This is great political rally music."
4,The Debut,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie - as part of the Philippine diaspora, I was delighted to rediscover parts of myself in the story and in the characters of the movie. It certainly made me more conscious of how much my Filipino background informs who I am today. How refreshing to see ""Us"" on the screen for a change, and to see what an imperfectly beautiful and beautifully imperfect people we Filipinos are.And the rousing ""Singkil"" dance suite alone was worth the price of admission.A thoroughly commendable effort on the part of the director, screenwriters and actors."
3,I can't say it's the BEST movie...,"I liked this movie, but I can't say it is a great movie. Although I could relate to some of the themes presented in the story, some of the dialogue were not realistic and the acting is not the best (with the exception of Eddie Garcia, who did an excellent job). It is, however, well done for an independent film.Having reviewed comments by others on various sites, it seems that this movie is much more appealing to a younger crowd. I do recommend it to those who might be interested in watching this type of film, but I also have to recommend that the viewer not go in with high expectations.I met the director at one of the showings in Los Angeles and found him to be a very friendly, intelligent, and frank person. I think the film is a good first effort of its kind."
2,Pilipino Culture Night (PCN) on Film,"If you've ever watched a PCN, then you've already seen about 90% of this movie. You have the stereotypical Filipino parents who don't understand their American raised kids, thrown in a Muslim dance suite, a modern dance suite, a few Filipino-American jokes, and you have this film.....just like a PCN. While entertaining, it's a story we've all heard way too many times before."
4,"Superb musicianship, classy lyrics","Agustin Lara is one of the best ambassadors of Mexico. I read about him in the instructive ''The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music,'' by Billboard Books, and the reviews there did not exaggerate this man's standing. He is awesome and the music just wonderful. Highly recommended for anyone library. RJ"
4,Quietly Sinatra,"Nice CD, but of the Sinatra of a different time. I have a recent one that I received this past Christmas, when he was older, but full of fun, and wise cracks, as it is in a club for the most part, but he still was in great form, and not inhibited at all! On this, he sings very well, and it is lovely, but he is much more subdued, and I sort of like the Sinatra of the ""Rat Pack"" stage -- uninhibited, and right on!"
2,"Sinatra is great, but Nelson Riddle is so heavy handed","Back in the Fifties this was my favourite LP and I thought Nelson Riddle was the bee's knees. Hearing it again last year I found I just couldn't stand the heavy blaring arrangements. I can't listen to it now, even though I love Sinatra's singing more than ever. And that goes for other Nelson Riddle backed albums too - he got worse and worse. Does anyone else feel this?"
5,Frank's 2nd of three GREAT Capitol Swingers!,"I actually place this album slightly below ""Swinging Lovers"" and ""Come Dance with Me"".No doubt,there are some masterpieces here.Actually Six.They are ""Night and Day"",the followup to ""I've Got you Under My Skin"",the best uptempo version I've ever heard.""I Wish I Were in Love Again"",an anthem to all frustrated and jaded lovers out there.I wish I could hear lyrics like this to a current song on top 40 radio!(Fat chance) ""Lonesome Road"" and ""From this Moment On"", both not recorded too much elsewhere,maybe because very few others realistically decided they could not match these version!!Both are without peer! ""If I Had"" which has been done by just about every one,though none with the fun and bounce this has.And,a nice add on,""Lady is a Tramp"",another classic that Frank owns. But with 16 numbers here,you can be sure that as usual,the vast majority are worth the admission price."
5,One of the best American albums ever made. (Period),"This is one of the essential classic Sinatra albums, full of Cole Porter, great Nelson Riddle arrangements and the Chairman in his prime. 'Night and Day' is one of the foremost classics, 'I Wish I Were in Love Again' is wonderful and the list goes on. I own more than 50 Sinatra albums and this rates among the best. GREAT album, a definite STRONG RECOMMENDATION."
4,Sinatra Makes Everything Better,As a Frank Sinatra fan I am just going to say he performed this wonderfully. Just like everything else he does! But seriously Sinatra just adds flair and class to whatever he does. And that is enough said.
5,This one you must own,"Frank is really at his peak here. This CD is representative of all of the things we love in Frank. He captures your heart. This would be nice if it were live. I recently got the Ratpack Uncensored CD, and it was like this, but hearing the audience enjoy him as well, makes it even better."
4,Great Alternative for American Girl Dolls,"This is a well made product that assembles easily and is a great alternative to the more expensive doll beds for American Girl dolls (or any other 18"" doll). The bedding is included, which is another bonus!"
5,SEEMS NICE,Im thinking about ordering this for my american girl today doll taylor she needs a bed and the ones from americangirl is $160 and way to espensive so this seems like a good deal at only $40. the only thing is if i get the doll armore to go with this to put taylors clothes in itll end up costing just about as much as if i would just buy the bed from americangirl that has a closet built in to it with the shiping and everything. ill probly get the one from ag because taylor needs a closet but i dont know yet anyway nice doll bed.
1,Junk.,"What a horrible experience. If there had just been ONE thing wrong with this item I could have excused it as a fluke but come on...nothing was right!1) The product box was shredded. Not the shipping box, the actual product box was completely torn up...did someone not notice this when packing it?!2) The headboard was cracked. Not a tiny crack, a huge crack.3) The legs all had cracks in them.4) The bed was unusable anyways despite all the cosmetic flaws because one of the 4 main screws that hold the headboard/footboard on would not even screw in all the way as though the hole was not drilled all the way.For $50+ I would have expected something a little better than this."
1,Poor Customer Service & Planning,"I was able to purchase the Filtered Shower Head although it was extremely difficult to find & could not even be ordered through ShowerTek. The product itself exceeded expectations and worked properly. However, the filters last approximately 6 months. After buying the product, I am not able to purchase any of the replacement filter cartridges anywhere including the manufacturer.Their customer service is absolutely horrible along with their product planning. Every site that carries this product and the replacement filters are ""Out of Stock"". Whoever is responsible for their product planning and management should be fired instantly. Based on what I have seen, I would suspect this is a one person operation and they are making them out of their garage and got in a little over their heads."
1,Pretty awful,"I had high hopes for this since Mark is such a great bluegrass bass player, but he is not a gifted teacher, at least in this format. I've been playing electric for almost 20 years, but am brand new to bluegrass, so I consider myself a beginner in that context. I was either bored to death or completely lost throughout this entire dvd. He spends what feels like hours rambling on about tuning and incredibly simple elements of the bass itself, and then will jump right into theory with no bridge or explanation of how to get there. He never even tells you what key they're playing in, discusses song structure, or teaches anything that a beginning bluegrass bass player actually needs to know. It's very disappointing and awkward."
5,A MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE,"There's a saying that applies to muscles and minds: ""If you don't use it, you lose it."" Anyone who has watched their own mind or the the mind of someone they love begin to slip knows how painful it can be. Prior to this book, it seemed that all one could do was to helplessly watch this process. Dr. Small's book shows that there are many things all of us can do at any age to keep our minds vital and sharp. Recent research has shown that the brain can in some cases regenerate brain cells. It wouldn't surprise me if in the future some of the practical approaches that Dr. Small offers may actually assist in that process."
5,Very enjoyable,I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and feel like I could live a little less materialistic and spend more time enjoying nature. I think if you approach this book with an open mind you will really enjoy. Mr. Peterson is a very inspiring individual.
1,Big waste of money,"Mr. Petersen is a far left liberal hippie. Throughout the book (I actually only made it about halfway through before I could no longer force myself to read anymore) he is always interjecting his misinformed political views, always saying how bad the humans are compared to the animal kingdom, (especially American humans), but yet he seems to enjoy his car (which he says it always smokes a lot when it is running), electricity to run a few house hold items, (radio, well pump, hot water heater), and the gas to run his chainsaw and his car. He is not too divorced from the ""evil civilization"", considering he does have a road that goes to his cabin."
5,looks good and sounds good,"This exhaust system has a nice deep sound, not overly loud and looks great. For the price, I believe any Gibson exhaust is a good deal!"
2,DISAPPOINTED...WASTED MONEY,This tile cutter is ok for making horizontal or vertical cuts but diagonals....NO WAY. I still can't figure out how to use it to make a diagonal cut. The cutter does not allow the tile to be snapped in the middle it can only be snapped when the cutter is placed to the top SINCE THE CUTTING WHEEL CAN'T MOVE UPWARDS......not flexible enough.
5,"Better than just a ""Good"" Tile Snap cutter","I bought this score and snap cutter from Amazon, and I am very pleased with its solid construction and very good performance. I consider it a very good value"
2,Al Martino Capitol Collectors Series,"This CD needed to be remastered before it was released for sale. The tone is a flat as a 2 week old beer.It just doesnt have the sound quality of Al Martino's beautiful voice. It sounds like you are hearing it fromyour neighbors house... very disappointing, I'm sure Capitol just hurriedly put this out there to capitlize on his death."
3,ummm,"yeah....wasn't much a fan of this dvd. its way too 'simple', not alot of depth to the story, so its very easy to follow. the characters are very lively, i'd say this is a good one for the teenagers. its well drawn though. this reminds me ALOT of the Mai-Hime series in the ""feel"" of it. story and plots are very different, but ya just get the same feel from both series. not for those interested in more in-depth anime. its a fun one for the teens."
5,"The sisters known to all,well over 30 yrs of music.","This is one of the finest albums they produced.You cannot be disappointed.Any of their albums you cannot be disappointed.What else can I say about this duo,except that one of the sisters died."
5,hand made baby crib,lISA lANING WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL ABOUT THE BACKORDER ON THIS PRODUCT. SHE KEPT ME INFORMED IN CASE IT DID NOT ARRIVE FOR CHRISMAS. I WILL ALWAYS DO BUSINESS AND RECOMMEND THE HOBBY PLACE AND LISA. THE CRIB IS ABSOLUTELY PRECIOUS AND CAN BE SOMETHING MY GRANDDAUGTER WILL GIVE HER DAUGHTER. WE ALL LOVE IT AND AS I SAID IT WAS BECAUSE OF LISA AND HER CONCERN THAT MADE IT EVEN MORE SPECIAL. THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE A PLEASURE. THANKS LISA.
4,Cute Crib a B to assemble,"Bought this for my 2.5 yr. old daughter. Very cute, I think she'll be more into it when she's three. The design is larger than the picture depicted however it is a great peice of children's play furniture. The only down side was trying to assemble this...warped pieces/mismatched holes make for a strenuous assembly. :)"
2,"bought for brand, not impressed","Usually love M&D toys, but this was a little on the cheap side. A hole had been drilled and then refilled and it was actually much harder to put together than you'd think. it is larger than it loos and rocks so if you want a stationary doll crib, this would not be for you."
2,Poorly Constructed,"I'm no carpenter, but I'm fairly handy. I've put together my fair share of ""Assembly Required"" furniture for both children and adults. This item goes together using the ubiquitous furniture dowel and bolt setup, but it is just not constructed properly for that. Several of the pieces do not fit together easily, and when they are finally put together, the holes for the furniture dowels are too large, and the poor fit causes the bolts to go at a strange angle, making it difficult to go together at all. The good news is that this is not designed to hold human beings, so poor support shouldn't cause any injure, but it's just not built well. I would encourage you to know what you are getting into before you buy this."
2,Difficult Assembly,"This seemingly simple toy was maddeningly difficult to assemble. If you can find one at your local toy store pre-assembled, it's worth your money. If Santa's bringing this for Christmas, his elves will need lots of time, patience and strong eggnog."
3,Antologia de Poemas de Amado Nervo,"It didn't have all of the poems that I was looking for. All of the poems contained in La Amada Inmovile, otherwise it is ok"
5,lots of fun!,"Plenty of songs to choose from. Songs are well done and had no visual gliches. Downside is that there are not main vocals to assist. Background vocals are done well, though. Very happy with purchase. WEll worth the money."
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought this set when I first purchased a Karaoke machine, hoping that I'd get some bang for the buck. Unfortunately not. All of the songs sound like musac - not the original bands."
2,unknown songs,most songs are unknown otherwise the quality is Ok and it plays well on any karaoke machine. so to me it is not worth it.
3,Check them all,This is a great collection of songs. Make sure you check all of your discs when you receive them. Four of my discs had only the music with no words. The comnpany did send out replacements in a timely manner though. I would still recommend these to anyone.
1,kareoke,"Have not resieved my order. Have been communicating with sell and they were suppose to resend and give me a new tracking number,,,IM BEGINNING TO GET UPSET!!!! order was 9-02-11And now Amazon is not show i even have an order coming, Your letting me down guys!!!"
1,Parents... Warning! Closer by Nine Inch Nails,"First, let me say that I am very pleased with the wide variety of songs and would recommend this collection minus disc AHM 2009. I gave the collection a one star rating because many parents will not be familiar with the words contained in the song Closer by Nine Inch Nails on disc AHM 2009.I am grateful to Southpaw for providing a list of the songs for the CD+G collection. I checked through Southpaws's list before playing the cd's in our Karaoke machine for family night. When I came across this song, I shredded the disc even though that meant losing the other songs. It is not a song I would want my children or family singing."
2,Ok but not great,I spent alot of time just trying to find a song.. wish this was a printed list that I could easily find what I needed.
3,Good starter pack,"This collection contains a wide variety of songs and genres, but they are spread across each CD so you'll be switching CDs a little more frequently than you probably want to. The image/lyric quality is also a little uneven: some are spot-on, while others don't always display the lyrics before you are supposed to sing them. The music quality is perfectly satisfactory with a few quite excellent covers."
1,Karaoke All Hits super Pack,This was the worse set of karaoke discs I have ever received. I do not recommend it. The back ground music over rides the singer but most of all the arrangements and musical instrument background is terrible and does not resemble the artists at all. EX: Wonderful tonight by Eric Clapton was totally dissatisfying.
4,Great selection of songs,"Good value for the price. A huge selection of songs in different genres. You're sure to find some favorites on each disc. There were a few songs that had words that could not be seen clearly, and one where the wrong music came up for the titled song. But considering all the songs that you get, and pretty good quality music too, the few mistakes can be overlooked. I would recommend this collection."
2,"worked well, for about 3 weeks","The controller is fair quality. It worked great for about 3 weeks, now I don't even use it anymore. The buttons aren't very responsive. You really do have to push down on them harder than the microsoft controller. The other problem that i have with the controller is on the left joystick. I don't even have to touch it and the person on the screen strafes to the right. I can't pay halo with that controller anymore cuz it's just really annoying when you try to shoot someone."
1,0 stars,first of all this controller [stinks] it would be worth the 10 dollars extra 2 buy the orginal or the new s type controllerthe buttons u have to mash in most of the time to get them to respond the left joystick thing u pretty much touch and ur charectar on halo will crouch the triggers are nice though but i didnt like the shape of it and if u play halo and have this controllers do not use a weapon that can zoom cause u barely touch the right stick and it zooms.
1,Bad controller,"I gave this controller two chances (the one that came with the xbox, and the one I got when I returned the old one)... both times it failed miserably, buttons don't always work, keeps getting 'disconnected' without really disconnecting, etc."
2,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Do not buy, this, for the same price you can get the XBOX controller or controller S (from microsoft). I have had nothing but trouble from 3rd party accesories, especially interact."
1,it stinks,"I bought this comtroller because they were out of the microsoft ones.IT STINKS. the buttons dont work. i'm returning mine. repeat:IT STINKS, DO NOT BUY"
3,Basic phrases to get by,"This book is good for basic phrases to get by. It's better to get a book specific to the language you will be using, or use the internet for a better view of the specific language. However, for the casual tourist who wants to know a few phrases, it can be helpful."
5,Well designed and tough carry-on!,I'm a business consultant and travel internationally frequently. This bag is tough and well designed. It has two compartments -- one that can be used for a suit and shirts (or it's a great way to separate your shoes if you're not taking a suit) and the other for everything else. Plus there are three zippered cubbies accessible from the outside of the bag. The material and zippers are tough and have held up very well through quarterly trips to Europe and countless other overnighters. Any weary traveler knows the importance of a good strong retractable handle (that doubles as something to lean on) and high quality wheels. This bag hits the mark there. It's easy to pull as you make your way through the airport and fits perfectly in the overhead or under the seat in front of you on a plane. And the red color makes finding it in the sea of black bags at baggage claim MUCH easier if you do decide to check it. My briefcase also rides nicely on top.
4,Let's take it nice and easy.,"This album by Frank Sinatra was recorded in the Spring of 1960. With the exception of the title song, all the songs are remakes of songs Sinatra had previously recorded from the 1940s to the early '50s. It's breezy title song notwithstanding, Nice 'N' Easy actually is an album of romantic ballads of a decidedly ardent, even reflective feel. In short, the sort of material that Sinatra performed better than any other singer. The songs were arranged by Nelson Riddle. Sinatra fans should dig it."
4,Tops in Italy,"I saw this video while in Italy. It is a great dance/lounge mix track, and the video consists of 3 girls dancing in crazy 60's fashions similar to those worn by Elizabeth Hurley at the end of the first Austin Powers flick."
1,"Looks great, but the plug didn't fit.","The item I received did not fit my VX8600. There may have just been a mixup in packaging somewhere. The box only said ""for LG VX8500"" but I've noticed that most things I've shopped for mention both the 8600 and the 8500. No problems returning the item. The plug on the pictured item looks correct and I suspect it is. The item I received was not the same."
5,Sand Timbres,"Reviewed by John Stauss 03/13/2002 10:43:48Awesome! Unbelievable skills, this new bard. An outsanding first book. Stephen's poems echo in the mind hours after reading. A must buy for weekend readers as well as literary connoisseurs. A nightstand staple.Edition reviewed: [Paperback | Dec 1998 | Gorion Press]"
4,A pretty good book on learning geometry yourself,"For me, I liked this book since it had tests at the end of every chapter to see where you were in that particular topic. I normally just went through each test and tested myself with the multiple choice questions, then gave my answers to a friend to mark (which was easy on their part so that was another plus, since it's simply multiple choice.) If I had less than perfect (yes, I strive to work my best!) then I go back (without looking at what the answers were to the questions I got wrong) and then checked over the chapter again until I think I knew the new answer.Any how, I think this concept is good; and marking multiple choice questions are very simple to do as well so it doesn't take up too much time from a friend or family member."
2,Confusing and boring,"Comparing this book with other thrillers, I think it's not the Casablanca of this century but rather the most confusing book I have ever read. A very good introduction but too many characters lost the plot and thus as a result the reader may find the book boring just like I felt. I've just finished reading Home Run by Gerald Seymour and I really enjoyed the latter. It's about international terro. as well but it's simpler and much more entertaining. Hope that not too many authors copy the style of this book."
5,Great movie but beware....,"Most of you looking at this page know about this great film so I am just going to comment on this specific dvd release from Cine Korea. Just as the Criterion release is NOT Anamorphic widescreen, neither is this version contrary to what the description says. That being said, the transfer is almost identical to the original Criterion release, but the new Criterion transfer is much better. If you really love the film, spend a couple extra bucks on the new Criterion re-release."
4,Great Drum DVD,"I have proudly added this to my drum DVD collection. Another master next to Erskine, Porcaro, Gadd, and other.Get this DVD, too."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this because of the cheapness factor and the fact that it matched my new red laptop. It worked great the first couple of hours but the constant shutting itself off and stuttering when it's active is a pain. The battery life may be long, but the device is a pain to use. In the long run, I am going to upgrade to something better, I was pretty disappointed."
2,Works well - to a point.,I brought this product because the color was nice and the price was cheap. I wish I would have gone to a slightly more expensive one. I works okay with my laptop if there is a good quality mousepad. It still skips around and doesn't move occasionally. This makes it difficult to work with for large projects with fine details. I wouldn't buy it again but I suppose it could be worse. The battery life doesn't seem to fade and it automatically shuts off during inactive periods which is a nice feature.
2,A Spotty Beginning,"This disc was better than I expected. ""Out of the Night"" and ""Nothing but Tears"" are passable blue-eyed deep soul cuts (although if that's what you're looking for, check out Dan Penn/Spooner Oldham). Once you get past the soul tunes, the material gets spotty and finally, really weak, until by ""Bells,"" you've entered laughable Vanilla Fudge territory (and according to the liner notes, Gregg thought so too). The album was mostly a Gregg vehicle; you wouldn't know that the same Duane Allman that a year later would go to Muscle Shoals and steal shows from the likes of Wilson Pickett is even in this band! You could wonder what this album would have sounded like if it had been recorded at Fame or American, but it wasn't. Pick it up only if you're a true Allmans fanatic, you can't stand not hearing it, and you can't find it used."
1,dreadful,"That's how Duane described it---""dreadful"". It is truly lame. I'm surprised Gregg didn't buy every outstanding copy and burn them. I would imagine that it's pretty embarrassing to listen to for him."
2,hourglass,"Hourgalss has Greg and Duane Allman in it. For that reason this lp will appeal to people and it has a couple good cuts on it, but on the whole it sounds like its overproduced with people behind the scenes trying to change the sound with lots of backup singing, horns, and corny late 60s pop touches added it it. There is another lp by the Hourglass on this site, that is closer to the sound that would later become the Allman Brothers. I would avoid this release and get Hourglass lp ""southbound"" instead. if your a Allman Brothers completeist, this lp does have signifigent historical value, but I dont think it will make it into anyones cd listening rotation"
5,Great on small Radial Arm Saw,"I'm using this on an old Dewalt MBF Radial Arm Saw. This saw only has 3/4 HP, but the thin kerf and 7 degree positive hook of the ATB teeth realy make this little saw perform. Cross cuts 4/4 oak like butter. Very smooth croscuts."
4,A story everyone should read,"I first became aware of WW2 escape organizations and The Comet Line in particular from the excellent historical novel, NIGHT OF FLAMES, by Douglas W Jacobson. I was intrigued by the bravery and sacrifice made by these very ordinary people in Belgium (many of them young women and teenagers). THE FREEDOM LINE is an excellent historical account of this remarkable chapter in WW2 complete with detailed storeis of the Belgian agents as well as the Allied pilots who were rescued. It is an inspiration for everyone."
3,good read but needed some extras,"This is a well written book and reads well, but it would have been better if it had included photos of the people involved and the areas described. It also could have used an index."
4,Not a studio band,"I saw this band open for Earth To Andy. Their live show was great, they had amazing amounts of energy. The album is pretty good, it's full of solid songs, but they're much better live."
3,Acceptable product,"Flap wheel has a relatively short usage span. In other words, it wears out too quickly."
2,More New Age than Nature Sounds,"I was hoping for more periods of nature's ""quiet"" between the instrumentals that at times seem too random and there is one spot where the audio cassette increases in volume, not good if you are just using it to get to sleep. It works well as mellow background sound though."
1,OOOO KKKK....,"Okay, I don't know who is writing the reviews the good reviews on this controller, but whatever they are on, I want some. I have never used a controller before that was this unresponsive or big. I have had multiplayer sessions of Halo, and all the guys agree that you have to really work the buttons and analog sticks to get the controller to respond. This is not a good thing in a fast paced game. It is way too unresponsive, and the size is a tad bigger than the standard xbox controller, which for someone with small hands, is not a good thing. I donot recommend you wasting your money on a controller that should've been designed better."
5,Magic! Takes out old stains and those little grease stains on dark shirts,"This safe and nontoxic product is flat-out amazing. (Not sure why the other reviewer's experience was so opposite of mine.) My only complaint is the 32 oz. refile is not available on Amazon and this magic bullet has been hard to find offline and on the web. I can't recall what store I got my now empty bottle at, so I'm resorting to paying the shipping premium for my favorite clothing saver."
4,a surprising story,The facts of the story of Carlos Ghosn are surprising. I read about Lee Iacocca years ago but what Carlos Gohsn did at Nissan is even more remarkable. The book is an easy read and it tells how it was done. I am afraid U.S. car makers are going to have problems with this man.
2,Too Much Padding,"The story of how a foreigner rescued Nissan would make a great book, but this isn't it. The writing is pedestrian, but, worse, there's too much padding. Magee takes a handful of basic points about Ghosn's management technique, and repeats it throughout the book, providing little illumination about the specifics. Shorn of the repetition and generalities, you could take all the content and reduce it to maybe 25 pages."
4,You will know more about the Nissan revival than the one Carlos Ghosn wrote,Obviously this book has not been written by a specialist in management but it gives you some of the management tools that Carlos Ghosn and his team used to save Nissan. One of them is probably the use of cross functional teams (CFT). I bet that Carlos Ghosn is the new Jack Welch. Future will tell!
2,A big disappointment,"I had very high hopes for this book but I was sorely disappointment.The blame shouldn't fall on Nissan or Carlos Ghosn because they did an incredible job of turning Nissan around.The blame should fall squarely on the author who is a horrible job depicting the subject matter.My biggest two problems with the book:1.The book seems to be written with no store-line, focus, or purpose.2.The book reads like a poorly written business article in some local town newspaper.It is really unfortunate because the story of Nissan is amazing."
2,"An ""OK"" book","This book covers a very interesting topic - Nissan's turnaround. But, if fails almost completely to give any relevant details about the turnaround. In fact, it almost feels like the author has no operations-related experience/knowledge and therefore he does not attempt to go deeper into the issues that Ghosn and team faced at Nissan. Additionally, the style of writing is mediocre at best."
2,Strong Acceleration; Weak at Cruising Speed,"I was disappointed in this book. I knew peripherally the incredible turnaround at Nissan orchestrated by Ghosn, so I had hoped to learn more to apply to my own organizations. This book would have been just as effective as a 40 page booklet--all the nuggets were in the first half. Nothing new in the second half. Borrow someone else's and stop at about page 60; you won't be disappointed."
5,automotive must read,"i worked in Japan for three years with Mazda and bought this book to understand how Carlos Ghosn (rhymes with cone)got the Japanese to work differently.The author talks to Japanese executives and has access to Ghosn and tells a good story that was helpful. I think anyone in the automotive business, especially management and executives, will be interested in how Ghosn and Nissan did it."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,I ORDERED AND WANTED THE BEANIE FOR MY HUSBAND FOR XMAS. Instead they sent me the watchmans cap. Not impressed considering Christmas is Sunday. So I guess i cant give a review based on the product since I didnt actually receive what I ordered.
4,A Beginner's Video With a Section on 2 Finger Thumb Lead Banjo,"Five-String Banjo For Beginners- This is actually a pretty good beginner's video, depending on what you want to learn. If you are looking to learn clawhammer or bluegrass banjo, this video will do you no good at all. If you are just looking to start and want to learn a few songs and maybe accompany your own voice, this video can help you do that. But it's not any good for learning to play with others. I wanted this video because of the section on 2 finger thumb lead banjo. That's mainly what it teaches and it's the style I wanted to learn. I had already been playing clawhammer for a while, so I was able to get the most benefit from that section. If you want to learn basic 2 finger banjo then this is about the best thing available."
3,Wing on Wing Doesn't Fly,"Recently Esa Pekka Salonen was here in New York City. He was charismatic, forceful and literally made the music soar at Alice Tully Hall. I quickly bought this CD and another of his and sat down to enjoy the music.The music on this CD, however, was not to my liking. It was a little too modern for me and I tried listening to it again the next day but came away with the same feeling.I also think that the sound was tinny and while there was nothing wrong with the disc the orchestra did not sound complete despite Salonen's solid direction.I'm glad I have it in my collection but it's not for everyone and unfortunately I'm one of those persons."
5,Sinatra at his best; a lover's delight.,"Of all sinatra's albums, I remember this one best. He sings em slow and sweet, taking his time on the lyrics and letting the listener slide into the mood with him."
4,The First Great Album,"In 1955 when, ""In The Wee Small Hours"", was realesed as an LP or long playing record it started a trend of great albums being realesed. In The Wee Small Hours is not only a masterpiece because its the first album of its kind its also the first album that contains songs which have feeling written into them. On the title track you can almost feel what he's singing about. This album is meant to have a place in any music lovers collection."
3,Not As Good as Critics Claim,"If it is possible to savor Frank's voice without actually hearing the lyrics of most of the songs on this recording, then this album ranks as listenable, not great. Despite Riddle's saving arrangements, the songs are musically weak (outside of Porter's, of course) and lyrically juvenile. The album has not stood the test of time despite the best efforts of Frank and Nelson."
1,FLAWED-wrong songs,THIS ALBUM IS FLAWED---When Your Lover has Gone is MISSING.Replaced with much worse song.DO NOT PURCHASE
1,Very Overrated,"A previous reviewer made the point that this re-recording, which should be better than the original, *isn't."" Quite true.It's also true that this is not Sinatra at his best. The musicianship is weak, tinkly and overdrawn. The arrangements are top-heavy and Sinatra himself seems to be led by the orchestrations, rather than the other way around.For a better bet, try ""Trini Lopez Live at the USO Jamboree."""
4,"Got a light, bub?","Slow. Painful. Gorgeous. Long cold rain on a gray old day. The midnight hours, the drawn voice, the linked, smooth jazz undertones give this album a legendary sound. Possibly the best break-up album ever made. Frank oozes the sentiment, “I get along without you.” but nobody will really believe it. If you’ve ever had your heart broke, this one will ring true. Careful."
2,"Classic album, horrible remastering job","Did anyone at the label listen to this before it was issued? The previous 1991 CD sounds vastly superior to this- the high frequencies are all but obliterated, and there's a strange echo that is'nt heard on either the original LP or the 1st CD. The other remastered editions of Sinatra's 16 Capitol/Reprise are excellent (with the exception of Songs for Swingin' Lovers). Do yourself a favor and pick up the still readily available 1991 CD instead. Capitol, this classic of American popular music deserves better!"
1,A terrible disappointment,"Computer has completely failed three times since I bought it 7 months ago. First time HP had it for a month waiting for a part. Second time (three weeks later) I had to install a new hard drive. Two months down the road I have had to reinstall the whole system (lost all my settings and programmes, but at least I didn't have to reinstall all the documents and music). I would estimate my wasted time at about 100 hours of installing and reinstalling so far.The HP customer service is abrupt and often rather rude. Certainly I have received completely conflicting advice from different agents. Often I have reamined completely uninformed of important facts; even once - when they decided unilaterally that they weren't going to process the warranty issue at all.They refuse to replace the product or refund my purchase price (which was from a large computer retailer).All in all I couldn't recommend this product or HP computers less highly"
4,nice computer,"Nice computer. I thought it would be a little faster but runs nice and smooth. Seller was excellant. Great communication, easy to contact and quick to respond. Thanks"
4,Hard to find and surprisingly good!,"When I first saw the artwork on the album cover, I thought it was some reissue of a metal band from the early 80's. It turns out that it is a Swedish metal band from 1999, and it is great! I would call it a definite cross between Iron Maiden and various Power Metal bands. There is great guitar riffing with awesome harmonizing leads and changes throughout that keep you wanting more. Check out the killer bass chugging that sounds just like Iron Maiden's Steve Harris circa 1980! This is not your average or boring power metal style, and should satisfy any fan of the genre. What makes it even better is that it is recorded very well in that it gives maximum power to each instrument. Definitely a recommended addition to your Metal library - the search is worth it!"
4,A nice addition to your collection,"A nice choice for anyone enjoying fast, energetic power metal. The music itself does remind of Stratovarius, with its sudden changes of rhytm and impressive guitar passages, although there is a strong oriental theme going through most compositions. Good vocals, too... Nothing new per se, but this album will surely become a decent addition to your music shelf."
1,Cannot watch the movie,I took the movie overseas The fact that it does not work in a different zone is not clear in Product description. I have purchased a movie that i cannot see. I wonder if you have it with European mode so i can use the product. Shefi
1,what a pity,"I'm from Sri Lanka. I bought this product online, but unfortunately I couldn't see this film due to some technical problem. When I tried to open this film it appears on the screen "" this film cannot open in catagory 'C' players. (My player is a latest samsung blue ray 3 D player.)pl.advise me how to overcome this problem"
1,an absolute bore for anyone over the age of 5,"If it were possible to give this movie zero starts, I would have done so. I laughed twice during the first 45 minutes of the movie, and then gave up and turned it off. This movie is targeted at the sense of humor of a kindergartner and, unlike many of the other fine films in this genre, has no overtones of humor that appeal to the adults in the audience."
1,Amazon movie? What movie?,"Amazon never allowed me to view this movie even the next day after purchase. I paid for nothing, but supposedly I will be receiving a refund, so that will be good to get back......the time I wasted trying to use their system to watch a movie?? Lost forever...grrr.."
2,RIO 3D is not Region Free,"Warning!! despite several sites indicating that this BluRay movie ( Rio 3D) is region free it is NOT. I have just received my copy from Amazon am so disappointed.It is region A only and consquently will not work with region B and C players. So I am stuck with 2 useless discs.So don't double check, triple check!! I hear its a great 3D disc though so it looks as though I shall have to get the local version."
3,Scratched DVD,I ordered 2 DVD's for our son. The Rio DVD was scratched and pauses the movie in a few places---directly out of the box.
3,Entertaining but just not enough.,"This movie was entertaining but had no soul. I didn't really feel for the characters like in other animated movies. Also the beginning and ending felt rushed, I would have liked to see them elaborate a bit more in those areas. Kids might like this movie but for an adult who likes animated movies like I do, it was worth the rent but I won't be adding it to my collection."
5,Great movie with fun songs and joy,Rio is a great movie. I love the songs and story of the movie. The film is also great in 3d as it makes some sceans look more vibrant. I hope it wins a Oscar.
3,Unexceptional but well made light entertainment,"Unexceptional but well enough made light entertainment. Pretty decent voice acting with Jesse Eisenberg being the standout; whenever his character (Blu) spoke, I was completely engaged."
4,Christmas gift,"I purchased this for a gift. They really liked it. We also have the movie. It is a great cute movie, my kids love it.. The person I bought for is like a kid at heart. He will enjoy it was.."
2,Not for 5-11 year olds,"There are some positive aspects to tbis movie, but they're adequately covered by others. The aspect that made this a regrettable choice for us is the sexual innuendo. I think the film is fine for little kids (5 and under) who don't perceive any of this or for 12 and older kids who are already encountering this at school, but between 5 and 12, we simply found the direct connection to the act of sex to be way, way too much. It's carnival in Rio, so clothing is really scanty on the human characters; another negative. Too much shake your booty.I don't mind talking about how babies are made with my kids. I love that they dance and watch others dance. They simply don't need to see sexuality/sensualty at this age."
5,rio,in great conditions! the movie was like new. very happy with the product. and the price was a better than any store.
3,it's ok...,of all the computer animated movies out there...this one is my least favorite. it's ok - it has some funny moments - young children will enjoy it...adults might want to find other things to do while the kids are watching it...it's not bad but it's not great either...
3,Son loves it,"My son loves this movie. Only complaint is that some of the scenes seem more adult-appropriate. Of course my child doesn't get this, but the movie would still be better without it."
5,MY GRAND-NIECE LOVED IT,"The color animation was spectacular. A movie that should be seen in 3-D. The plot and dialouge are slightly less than colorful. It Is not one of those movies designed to keep parents overly entertained. There are a few things kids won't get, like the Carmen Miranda hat on the bull dog. The movie is about poachers, breeding almost extinct birds, and the question of animal captivity. Blu, the last blue Macaw is happy in captivity and can't fly. Jewel, his would-be mate, hates captivity and loves to fly. Animated girls in bikinis, booty shaking, and Anne Hathaway as the naked Jewel bird (She just can't keep her clothes on anymore, even in an animated film.)My 9 year old grand niece loves this movie and has seen it about 3 times."
4,cute,"Our 3 yr old requests repeat viewings. I liked it too. Likes to get up and dance during the music parts of this movie as also dances with Madagascar, princess and the frog)"
5,Daughter's favorite,"We bought the movie for our daughter but love it as much as she does. Would recommend the movie to anyone who has children or just loves a good, cute , and funny movie."
2,bad 3D,"The 3D was very blurry during most action scenes. At first I thought it was an intended effect, but it began to get annoying. I started hitting the pause button and looking closely at each image separately, left eye then right eye. The frames were out of sync, either the left was ahead of the right or the other way around. Not only were they out of sync, but one would be clear and the other blurry. I have a very nice LG big screen TV and thus far have not had this problem with any other 3D disc."
4,No Portuguese soundtrack?,"This is a fantastic movie. The scenes of Rio De Janeiro are really fantastic and actually very realistic - there are parts of Rio that are just unbelievably beautiful. The story is fun and the music is also terrific.However, I was really hopeful that there would be a language soundtrack in Portuguese. Is that too much to ask for? That a movie that takes place in Rio and that actually has some dialogue in Portuguese, would have a Portuguese soundtrack?Thank you, ignorant, out of touch movie studio executive that made that call."
2,Rio blu ray/DVD combo,"The first delivery had a defective blu ray. the replacement was, too. Both were tried on 3 different players that are new and regularly play blu ray at 2 different households. Since it would be futile to request yet another replacement, we'll just do with the standard dvd and not bother with the blu ray combo packs. As an aside, one member purchased the same movie as a separate blu ray dvd at a local store and it played fine. Perhaps the manufacturer packed rejects rather than the real item?"
5,Kids favorite,My Granddaughter has watched this movie at least 50 times and never gets tired of it. I love it too.
4,Great 3D - OK story,It appeares easier to make animated movies 3D - and this is a good example of the high end of the 3D animated movie spectrum. My 12 year old grand-daugther totally loved it - I thought it was cute.
5,great movie,the best movie- i love it . we got it when we moved for the kids to watch in the car on the little dvd player and they loved it.
4,Good for children and adults,My six and four year old enjoyed this movie; and it was decently entertaining for the parents as well. I would recommend it.
5,Super cute movie,"This movie had quite a few LOL moments. Kids enjoyed it, we enjoyed it, worth the price of admission paid."
5,Visual Feast,"This movie is as satisfying to the eye as to the funny bone. The story is well written and easy to follow, but the colors are what will blow you away!!! If you are lucky enough to have a 3D TV, you are twice blessed!"
3,Rio,ok this movie my kids had to watch more then once to like it. I haent seen it yet. It came in great shape and in good time.
5,greta show,this such a wonderful show for all ages! the colorful bird's are spectaular! my kids enjoyed this pictuere so much they bought for there kids too.
5,Nice and entertaining.,"It is a very good family feature. It is even enjoyable for grownups. Just don't miss this experience.It is not the most original movie, or even a classic, but it is good viewing."
1,check format before you buy,"Unlike Transformers and Hugo,which were excellent,Rio would'nt playon my player.The error message I got was ,the format was wrong.Me,not knowing about different formats,but knowing about regions,got it wrong"
1,Rio,"Item was supposed to be 'new'. It has so many scratches on it, we can't watch it. No instructions how to return or get our money back."
1,"i was upset, the bluray dn't load or play, i guess is wrong","I was really disapointed with this bluray, the dvd works fine, but the bluray does not works, as a matter of fact it was not loaded or read by my sony bluray player, i delivered that product to overseas, but i need some suport to change my prodcutregardsAndrei Sarmiento"
3,Would've been better if it had more comedy and was written better,"This movie has some charm, but has very little comedy and bad writing hinders it a bit. This movie is okay overall. It would've been better if its obvious flaws were fixed. 7.5/10"
1,Did not work,This DVD does not work as it is coded for a region not happy as I was not told that it would be.NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NOT HAPPY
1,Blu-Ray has known issues.,I really can't review the blu-ray because even after updating the firmware on my Samsung player this disc just displays black screen. Several members at the Blu-Ray forums have stated Sony players can not play this disc either or will do so with skipping and stuttering issues. Avoid like the plague.
3,Great Movie!!!,"The movie is absolutely awesome however the only issue is that through out the beginning of the movie up until the 35 minute mark, the movie would freeze for a couple of seconds and cut out a scene. I would miss a few seconds of the movie but it will continue from the freeze point as if nothing happened. I have watched the movie a few times and it never freezes at the same points in that time frame however it is always in between the beginning and the 35 minute mark."
4,Rio,"I bought this copy for my brother. I gave my copy to my great granddaughter just to borrow, but she wanted to keep it, so I bought another one for me;-) We loved the movie very much. The music was wonderful. I'm a guitar player - my grandson is a drummer - my son is also a guitar player, so the music was right down our alley.ThanksDave DaggettGrants Pass, Or."
5,Cute Movie!,"I bought this for my 1 1/2 yr old daughter. shes getting more into watching movies now and ive been trying to get her ones with lots of music and/or dancing and she loves this movie because it has just that. She says ""Birdie!"" all the time while watching it and dances to the music, its so adorable. The movie itself is very cute and fun for all ages to watch."
4,Cute movie,This is a cute movie. It is not my favorite of all of the animated movies...I think the storyline could be stronger and the whole movie seems pretty short. I took my daughter to see this at the movie theater and at the end I felt as though we just watched a long cartoon.However...the animation and vibrancy is BRILLIANT. Gorgeous animation. It also sends a good message.We received this as a Christmas gift this year and the kids have already watched it numerous times.Kid tested Mother approved? Yes.
5,Such a cute movie!,I bought this movie for my nephews and they watch it every day! It is a very cute movie! I recommend it!
5,Great animated tale,"Kids, families, even adults with love this. As with any modern animated feature, the adult inuendos and under-tones are clear and prevalent while wholly maintaining the facade of simple kid entertainment. Watch it as a family and the reasons a kid and a parent will chuckle will be different."
5,Rio is beautiful! and so much fun fo the Kids!,"This is a great kid movie and adult one as well! Full of color, great songs and excitement for all ages!"
5,Gorgeous movie!,"My family can't get enough of this movie. Great storyline, fantastic animation, a soundtrack that will have you singing it all the time. This is amazing on Bluray on our 65"" Panasonic through the Bose surround sound. If you are looking for a kid-friendly movie that you won't have issues letting them watch daily (like most 2 year olds do) or more often, then this is the movie for you. Highly recommend to all audiences."
4,"Great kids film, better in 3-D","We have this film on DVD already bought the 3-D version and it's excellent my 5, 3 and seven-year-old love it"
5,Great Movie,"My son is four, he loves it and so do I. We like the music and the story. Blue is funny and I loved rooting for him! I loved the settings (it should have been nominated for an Academy Award). I hope they have a part two!"
3,Haven't seen this one yet,My grandchild was really excited to see this never been viewed animated cartoon. I am waiting to see how he liked it but it seems to be very entertaining.
4,Rio DVD,"The movie itself is a lovely story about love and finding your ""heart."" However, the story has been done before. And done better. With that said, the animation is amazing! The colors truly pop off the screen. This makes the story. The music is not overpowering, but could have had a few more songs. The song Nigel (former ""pretty bird"") steals the show. It has enough adult humor without being over the head of the kids. The subject matter does get mature (the smuggling of birds) and Nigel is scary at times, so the more sensitive/younger child might not be the intended audience. Otherwise this is a nice movie for older children and adults who enjoy a love story and/or great animation. The extra DVD or ""party edition DVD"" is a waste of time. The extras are weak and weigh down the rest of the movie."
5,Great price for a great movie.,I'm not going to go into the review on the movie itself but of how I made the movie cheaper. I told my mother I was going to buy this movie and she wanted the dvd. So she paid for half of the movie and I gave her the dvd copy since she didn't have a bluray player. As for traveling put the digital copy on your portable player and feed it into the travel tv displays. So if you find someone to go halfs or even split it 3 ways if you have another person in the family the movie could be cheap for all. The movie is one that will be watched more than once in fact my 2 boys (3 and 5yrs old) have seen it about 20 times now.
2,Blu-ray playback problems,"I have purchased the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital combo of Rio and was excited to be able to view the movie in a very crisp, vibrant, colorful high resolution of blu-ray only to find that PS3 would not play the blu-ray disk. I then went on to do some research and found out that I am not the only one having these issues. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, once you can actually watch it. This review is based on the item, not the movie itself."
4,why not make it in portuguese,They make a video in Brazil and have some portuguese words in it. Why would they not make the video available in Portuguese. I can only find it in English and Spanish. Doesn't make any sense. Other than that the movie was wonderful and colorful. Lots of action for a kids movie. Well worth the money. More 3d dvd's should be available without the 5 dvd pack. Some people only want 1 3d dvd not 5 dvd's
3,Good Family Entertainment,"A good film for the whole family, though a bit spoiled by the voice of Jesse Eisenberg--I say ""voice,"" but actually it's more like an annoying whine."
1,Why?,"I gave this only one star. I am rating only the DVD, not the movie, and the reason I give the DVD only one star is that the DVD is not available in 3D. I don't understand why they decided not to release this in the theatrical version (3D). Poor decision on the distributors' part."
1,DIGITAL COPY DOESN'T WORK WITH ITUNES,"Buyer Beware!! If you are purchasing this 3 disc set to use with iTunes it will not work. You can download this copy onto to your computer, but then it will NOT be accessible in the cloud. You will not be able to view this on your iPhone or iPad. Because Rio is no longer carried on iTunes it is not available on the cloud."
2,Good movie not Good condition,"I received the DVD out of place therefore the movie is very scratched, I'm very disappointed.this really is too bad because my kids were super excited about it."
5,Rio DVD/Movie,"This item was shipped very quickly. New, in its original wrapping, never opened. Very good deal! Movie is very cute and can watch it over and over again. Family friendly and enjoyable, especially for bird lovers!"
5,Great Value,"The biggest bonus of purchasing this version of the movie was that it contained the regular DVD, plus the BluRay DVD, plus you can download a digital copy. This boxed set was priced the same as the DVD version. It's cool to have 3 ways to watch the movie. We have a regular DVD player, my sister has BluRay, and we can watch the downloadable version on the computer."
2,Blu-ray doesn't work on PS3,"The story is great. Read other reviews for that.HOWEVER playing the Blu-ray on my Playstation 3 fails badly. I checked several other Blu-ray discs to make sure my PS3 wasn't broken. I also checked for PS3 software updates. Then I returned Rio for a replacement, but the replacement has the same problem: the video keeps freezing up on the PS3 while the audio continues. This happens every couple of minutes, ruining the film experience. Fortunately it comes with the DVD, so I watched that instead without any problems.I'm not the only one having this problem: [...]"
5,Great Movie!!!!!!!!,"I love Rio. It is a wonderful movie both kids and adults can enjoy. I love the story, the colors and the environment and was laughing through out the entire movie. The voices are paired up very nicely with the characters. You can't beat George Lopez as the Tucan.p.s. My friend got the chance to work on this movie at Blue Sky Studios and he is a brilliant artist."
1,Rio 3D quality,"We recently purchased a 3D tv and were anxious to add 3D movies to our collection. We purchased Rio 3D and did NOT enjoy the quality of the 3D. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, everyone had a headache (have watched other 3D movies without a problem), and switched it back to 2D setting.Quality of the 3D: HORRIBLEMovie rating: 5 stars! Excellent film (just horrible in home 3D)"
4,Great animated flick for kids and their parents,"We saw this at the theater, rented it and now just bought the Blu-Ray pack which is a superb value - you get not just the Blu-Ray disc, but also a DVD disc (great for the kids' portable DVD players) and a digital copy that you can download via a code to one device (e.g. a PC, Kindle or iPad). The movie itself is fantastic - my wife is Brazilian and spoke highly of the realism of the Rio scenes, including the favelas/slums, and the male lead being voiced by a native Brazilian. The humor is mostly for kids but some nice musical numbers too."
2,Locked to Region A only,"I rated this movies because I cannot play it on my LG BP325 3D Blu Ray player, it's made for Region B. How do unlock my player to play all disc regions. Please help alasys@msn.com"
5,Nice color,"The story is cute, the colors are so pretty and the music is enjoyable. Great story for the kids to watch."
4,For Ice Age Fans,"If you liked Ice Age, this is right up your alley. I am not a kid, however it brought out the kid at heart in me. I thought the color was well done and the animation quite smooth. And I liked not having to return a video tape to the store ;)"
5,Great movie,This was a surprisingly good movie. I had heard very little about it but for 5 bucks- it's a great deal.
5,Great,"My kids ages 7 and 4 love that movie! they probably watched it more than 10 times now. The theme is educational and the music is great. They know the words by heart and dance in front of the T.V.Both are asking to go to Rio (De Genaro) now, which hopefully we will do sometime..."
4,Love this movie! Disc skips.,"I love this movie, the soundtrack, the story. However, the movie skips quite a bit in the first 30 min. This happen to when we Netflixed it a few months ago. DVD manufacturer problem??"
3,Rio,I thought the movie was visually beautiful and the story line was entertaining. I would recommend the movie for children.
4,Too Much Singing!!,I enjoyed this movie but it has a lot of corny songs. It's a has a good plot that's very entertaining.
3,Very Colorful,I'm not a fan of 3D because I have trouble seeing it. But the product was what I expected! And fun to watch.
3,Kids love the movie in 3d and blu ray,great movie and the kids love it both in blu ray and 3d. i myself prefer it in blu ray.only 3star because the 3d disc has parts that skips even though there is no scratch in the disc.im not gonna bother returning or replacing.
4,GREAT MUSIC!,"First I want to warn anyone out there on first playing this bluray DVD(I have a LG bluray player)..it required me to have an Internet hookup.I rarely hook that up cause of all the spam I got but I don't want to have to hook that up..really??...only for software update to the bluray player...but this movie RIO..demanded I hook up that Internet connection for the first viewing & after that did not ask..thank ST Anthony!...cause I use my Ethernet Cable for my computer and my TV happens to be next to the computer which is a desktop..I am OLD SCHOOL but NEW iMAC!!...when I saw Rio about the third time...it's good and IT's ENTERTAINING BUT CAN SOMEone please explain WHY WHY oh WHY do I need THREE dvd's??..well I gifted my elderly neighbor with the extra but I don't watch these movies on anything smaller than my TV..same thing with ""Burlesque""..another movie I loved!Cheers..Tony(NYC)"
5,Rio,My grandson LOVES this movie and all the kids that come over Love it. Would recommened this kids love it.
4,Fun Movie!,My kids (3 and 6) love this movie. They get up and dance to it. It isn't too bad for an adult to watch as well... parents know what I am talking about.
5,Great 3D entertainment,Great 3D to add to your library. Enjoyable for all ages. Makes you wonder why there are not more 3D movies.
5,Whole family loves it,"I have a 13 year old boy, 11 year old girl who thinks she is a teenager and a 2 year old girl. All three love the movie. My two year old brings it to me at least once a day to play. Bright colors, good music and a good story. One of the best movies we bought for the family. My wife and I enjoy it as well."
3,Rio Review,"Well, sometimes the studios have a hit and other times... In the case of ""Rio - the Movie"" there are great digital graphics (wonderful detail and use of color), lots of scenes taken from the actual location (!), but a story line that was just - lame. Perhaps the writers were aiming at a very young audience... But even with a very young audience the Story Line is Everything. Let's put it this way: My Grandson likes to watch Finding Nemo occasionally. He hasn't asked to see Rio after the first time."
5,RIO,"Purchased this DVD to entertain my grandchildren during a recent visit and it was entertaining for all viewers. Adults tend to dismiss animated movies as being strictly for ""kids"" but the voices, dancing, singing and gorgeous animation held the attention of ""grown-ups"" as well."
5,Loved by the Whole Family!,My kids are obsessed with this movie. It was absolutely adorable and the whole family has watched it over and over again. This is one purchase I'm glad I made :)
5,Great!,Top-quality DVD and all enjoyed watching it a few times when we 1st recieved it a few weeks back. Looking forward to the sequel.
5,"It ""Takes a Village""","I have now read at least five Mrs. Jeffries mysteries. I bought seven from Amazon recently.Having the group of household help helping, unbeknownst to the Inspector with the solving of the crime makes for a clever read and a unique approach. The characters are defined by speech and roles they play both in the household (and some as neighbors) and in their detective work. Don't walk, run to Amazon.com to buy your copies.Patricia Walworth Wood"
3,Not as Good as Koko,"Good parts, but overall too talky and too much time spent with events not relevent to the ""mystery"" of the title. Tom, in the opening chapters, gets hit with a car running away from a threat and ends up in a hospital. There is a suggestion that his accident has changed him in a good manner, i.e., given him a kind of other-worldly power to ""see"" things...but this suggestion just goes away. Tom is essentially just another young guy who meets ""The Shadow"" a formerly famous detective. The two work on this years-old mystery which just isn't, in the end, all that compelling. I enjoyed Koko (Book one of this trilogy) but this was not as enjoyable because it didn't grab me. I also don't see it as a sequel to Koko. Perhaps the Blue Rose trilogy should be a Blue Rose duet. This doesn't seem to fit in at all."
3,Decent Book-- For Peter Straub,"Mystery was the third book by Peter Straub that I have read, and was probably the best. It seems that his work (in general) starts off rather slow and then gets interesting only to disappoint at the end. This was probably the least disappointing ending, although it did leave me wanting a bit more.I found Tom Pasmore to be more interesting when he actually acted like a teenager, and not so much when he became Lamont von Helitz; who is a character that I find pretty unbelieveable.Another thing that was odd was that in his effort to make this book timeless (can be related to any time period), Straub failed and just made me feel like I was reading a novel that takes place in 1940 but had a bunch of inconsistencies.Overall, I find Straub to be a decent writer who spends too much time trying to be fantastic and not enough time making his work believable and interesting."
3,I found the story confusing to follow at times.,"Characters who are mentioned, then come around later. With a Kindle, it's hard to page back to reference who certain people are, and their significance."
2,Painfully slow!,"This book was painfully slow. It's the second book of the trilogy and while it stands alone, it also, with book 1, ""Koko"" connects the reader to the last book of the trilogy."
2,Over Stating the condition of the book,"I recieved the book in a well packaged box. However, when I purchased the book I was told that the condition was Very Good. When I opened the box I found a book that was well read. The pages were very loose in the binding and the pages were discolored. Also there was a tear on the front of the book cover. I would have stated this books condition as Good.Alanon"
2,lacked any real direction; not a good read,this was my first peter straub book and i was deeply disappointed; certainly not a dean koontz or stephen king tale. plot was weak and very drawn out. characters didnt come alive for me. i could not recommend. will try one more of his books before i give up on the author.
2,Quite Poor...,"I did not enjoy this book. The characters are weak, the story line is unfullfilling and never really resolves satisfactrorly. A number of issues are never completely explained. Very difficult to empaphise with the main character. The island of Mill Walk in the Caribbean is completely unlike any island that exists in the region. A very poor try at a mystery, unimaginative, uninspired, watse of time."
4,Great Information but too delicate to play with,"I bought this item for my nephew who is a space-fiend. If it isn't space related, he doesn't want a thing to do with it. I figured I woudl buy this brand new Hoberman Space Dome. When we got it, we opened it to see how it was. It is a great looking to with lots of information. It's fairly easy to expand... the contracting back to normal is a bit problematic though. Its merely a hoberman sphere like you see everywhere now-a-days but with paper in between filling in the gaps. We did 20 tries of expanding and contracting and only 2 times did it go smoothly. There was always some part that didn't fold in right. It's a great looking toy and when fully expanded, I think he will enjoy so much. SO, we're keeping it and letting his parents worry about it. For 40 bucks, I would suggest getting something else though.... I don't think it will last 2 weeks past christmas. But what are aunts for if not for spoiling?!"
5,I love it !!!,"I am impressed of the bright spectrum of the artists, which shows their performances on this CD. I played it many times during the Christmas days. My whole family loved it."
3,Could Be Better,"I expected more from the Vatican Christmas. It is has more of a popular type of music, rather than traditional style. I would say that this particular performance is somewhat ethnic slanted to Afro-American or Black culture. That is OK, but not enough balance."
5,Excellent,"Excellent documentary, very entertaining and it tells you a beautiful story of one of the greatest F1 drivers ever. For F1 lovers or any Brazilian at heart it is a great great movie."
2,Doesn't play!,"I can't get the disc to play! Error message said my PS3 needed update before disc would play. So far, I haven't connected my PS3 to Internet, now I have to, in order to view this movie....frustrating."
5,"Hey guys, there is more in the box!","This price can look absurd for two bluray disks, but notice there is more on this box, there is also a 1/12 miniature from Senna Lotus.Ok, even then the price looks a bit high, since you can buy Senna McLaren MP4/6 from Tamiya (a kit to build) from less than $200.BUT, this Lotus is already finished metal miniature and you cant find it anywhere else, not in this scale."
5,What a great documentary,"Compelling from start to finish, this story of one of the greatest race drivers of all time is so good and so exciting, and such a fascinating in-depth portrait of an enigmatic and driven man, that it would appeal to all types of viewers and not just auto racing fans."
4,Well-made tribute to Senna,"This is must-have for any Formula 1 fan. It was Senna/Prost rivalry that made me fall in love with this pinnacle of motor racing. The documentary has many fascinating behind-the-scenes clips that a fan would enjoy. Personally, it confirms my opinion that Senna is the greatest modern-era F1 driver to have ever lived. Schumacher, while great in his own right, would likely not have seven titles to his name if Senna had not met an untimely death."
5,Excellent,Great collections of the life of Senna. A must have for a Senna fan! Don't miss your chance to purchase a copy.
5,Senna Film,I came a across this thanks to my girlfriend. She suggested I should get this if I'm such a fan of Senna. I can only descrive it as the best Film I've seen about Senna. Excellent compilation of key events and a great story.
5,Senna DVD Great,"I bought this DVD for my husband, who does amateur racing. He was so excited! Couldn't believe I had tracked the release date in the US. He said it was a great documentary of not only Senna but all the accidents that transpired that weekend... and racing in general."
5,Blu ray,"After waiting and waiting for the US release, I just purchased the Blu ray version from AmazonUk (3rd party seller in the US!) and it plays just fine on my PS3. Apparently Universal releases region-free blu ray as it says so right on the packaging."
1,Senna -,"Do not buy this video if you live in the United States. Similar to USA/Europe cell phones, this DVD not work on DVDs sold in the United States. We wanted to try because some DVDs from Europe will play on for USA designed players, THIS ONE WILL NOT. To bad they are selling this product on Amazon for the US market!"
5,Highly recommended,"This is a brilliant film about a fascinating person. Probably the best film I've seen in recent years. I never heard about Senna and never saw a formula 1 racing but after watching this film, I read tons of materials on line, watched clips on youtube and bought a book about Senna. I'm glad the film was presented in a theatre close to where I live.Saw it numerous times. Fascinating. For those in US, wait until it comes out on a DVD carefully done (subtitles, etc.) It's worth it!"
4,English subtitles are not available on the main DVD.,"The first thing you need to know is this is a Region 2 PAL DVD. I have a region-free DVD player so I could play it no problem but most DVD players in the U.S. will not play this movie.This is a first rate documentary of the racing career of Senna and I really enjoyed it. Interviews are recorded in the original languages (some are in English) and have subtitles available in Portugese and Italian. The second 'Extra Features' disk has English subtitles available. I didn't really see much there to watch.Enough of the interviews are in English so even without subtitles, I could follow much of the story and it is a great story.I have this movie in Blu-Ray also and bought this thinking it would add English subtitles so I could see what was missing from the Blu-Ray. The main feature is the same -- Portugese and Italian subtitles only."
2,Cheaper to order from the UK,"Even with the exchange rate you'd be better off ordering this package - and it's a real fanboy must-have package for the completist - from Amazon UK. Works out at about $420. Stil ludicrous for what you get, but if you desperately want it..."
3,positive,"I cant fault the product itself, its just that I made the mistake of ordering the italian version of the dvd and not the english version.The seller was more than happy to exchange it though and was very prompt in their responses to my questions."
2,Senna Triple Play DVD,"The seller did not state you could not watch the DVD on US equipment. It said triple play, DVD Blue Ray digital. Fortunately I could download and watch the show on my laptop. It is a great documentary on Senna that would only be even better on a large screen. If it is available in US compatible format and you are a F1 fan buy it! Brought back memories of how much I despised Ballestrie and Prost, the glory of France instead of the glory of competition."
1,Not as Described,"The description says the language is in English. However, it is not. The bonus material has English subtitles, but I bought this to watch the feature.I've contacted the seller for a refund."
1,make sure movie is for an AMERICAN DVD Player,Very disapointed. Move cam in Italian and unless I purchase a NEW DVD player for ALL regions I can't view it. SO this was a waste of my money and I had to purchase a new one.
5,so inspiring,loved it. watched it three times and de cided to buy it. i recommend it a hundred percent even if you are not an f1 fan
4,"An excellent film, about racing and otherwise","An engaging, gripping and ultimately moving film that happens to be about racing. I'm a gearhead, so no shock that I loved it, but even my wife (who couldn't care less about Formula One, motorsports politics or anything in between) got really wrapped up in it."
