3,A harbinger of transition from disco to rock-pop,"""Looking Up"" and ""Who Do You Think You're Foolin'"" seem to ""dispense"" (audio-wise) a certain degree, however small it may be, a ""scent"" of funk/disco - this at a time disco had been dead already for a few weeks or days,- after Lipps Inc. debut album's resuscitation ran its course. Donna picks up a ""body part"" from Disco's ""corpse"" and revives it by incorporating it in those two songs.""Breakdown"" is fairly good too, albeit it lacks the upbeat spirit of the two other songs I have mentioned. Being a Disco freak and fan, I admit to not caring about the other songs, although I'm not judging them."
3,NOT AMONGST HER BEST,"Although I really love Donna Summer's work, I cannot give this album more than 3 stars. The title track is catchy enough, and I also enjoy Cold Love, Who Do You Think You're Foolin' and Stop Me. The music is very different from her synth-laden disco roots - more rock and pop, though still with a high danceability factor in some instances. But most of the songs here are not particularly inspiring and are really quite average. A far cry from the brilliance and originality of Bad Girls and Once Upon A Time. But this not a bad album, just disappointing when one knows what Donna Summer is capable of achieving."
1,Disco is Over,I always considered myself the ultimate Donna Summer Fan..butwhen this long awaited Geffen release hit the air waves I knewDisco was over..I have never been so disappointed in an album..even though I remember the first time I heard Hotstuff its hard rock edge I knew things were changing...
4,New Wave Donna,"Another great Donna Summer set. This time, Christian views once again come into play (actually this might be the first time they were heard as loudly, while in 'Bad Girls"" they only seem implied). The tracks are all brilliant New wave sounding and are an escape form the disco formula. Maybe not the best escape. The highlights are by far the fun title track, the rocking ""Cold Love"", and the R&B sound of ""Breakdown"". All the tracks are great. ""Looking Up"" is an awesome inspirational song that still has a good beat to it. Not disco, but rather pop rock. The songs are experimental and genius but still no matches for the power of her songs ""Bad Girls"" ""Once Upon A Time"" and ""Live and More"". While ""Grand Illusion"" is an over the top trip, it is hardly a ""Faster And Faster To Nowhere"". Even with that said it is still a bold and good album."
5,An Aquired But Rewarding Taste,"Summer makes it pretty clear on the Bobby Darin-inspired rockof the tital track,""Cold Love"" and others that she is completelythrough with disco.Filled with rocked-up guitars and roudy,slinkysinging Donna Summer proves (however needlessly) that she CAN be a rock 'n roll star and not just a mere disco queen.My own favorite is ""Grand Illusion"",an unusual piece fashioned in layersof leslie-amplified percussion.Certainly an artistic triumph for the singer ""The Wanderer"" is a must-have for fans who don'tcare much for disco but do like Donna Summer.Curious?"
1,superficial information only,"The book provided little insight or information about these virtual worlds, and completely failed to enlighten the reader as to the technology which made these worlds interesting. It provided an basic overview of the worlds, a brief history, and how to manuever around in them, however this failed to give any substance to the writting.As the author notes in the forward, this was his first attempt at writting, and it clearly shows as entire text was written at an elementary school level. This made the reading uninteresting as well as uninformative.For those uninitiated with the Internet, virtual worlds, or any other form technology, this might serve as a good spring board. However, if the (to be) reader is looking for anything more than a general overview, I would recommend finding a different source from which to learn."
1,Bruce doesn't get it....,"Really, a hopelessly outdated book even at the time it was published. Mr. Damer fails to consider the online gaming community and how it is the GAMING COMMUNITY which will enable the Internet to truly become a 3D universe. A quick look at Mr. Damer's web site (www.Damer.com) also reveals how Mr. Damer just doesn't ""get it""...he is still attempting to push the concept of ""avatars"" through his ""company."" Maybe Bruce should load up a copy of Counterstrike or Unreal Tournament and see what the future of ""avatars"" and the Internet will really be in the near future."
5,Wow! One of my favorite jazz albums.,"Every once in a while, I listen to an album and find myself shaking my head, exclaiming ""Wow!"" aloud, and getting tears in my eyes, the musicality and virtuosity is so outstanding. This is one of those albums, definitely one of my favorite jazz albums ever.It's striking how Peterson, Pass, and Brown are three of the most virtuosic players of their instruments you'll find anywhere, and they show it on every track on this album, and yet it's almost as though they can read each other's minds as they seamlessly weave together complex, beautiful harmonies and rhythms.One interesting highlight was hearing Oscar play the organ on some tracks (Blues for Dennis, Sunny, and Eyes of Love). A rare treat!"
5,Easy to see why Twain is one of America's Classics,It is hard to believe that one writer could create such a diverse group of stories on all kinds of subject matter; each one written with Mark Twain's unique sense of humor and extraordinary gift of imagination.These stories also stand the test of time as they are every bit as entertaining now as they were over 100 years ago.Some of the ones that I enjoyed the most;The Canvasser' Tale; the story of a man's collection of echoesThe Diary of Adam and Eve; a humorous look at what Adam and Eve's first thoughts of each other and the world around them.The McWilliamses and the Burglar Alarm.The Californian's Tale with a twist at the end.This collection is writing at its very best; a treasure of American story telling.
2,Morbid Ending,"If you're expecting Mark Twain's usual funny and cheerful stories, stay away from this one.*Spoiler alert!*The ending is simply sad."
2,A Dog's Tale: My Review,"I only got this to test my new Wi-Fi. And, while the writing style is brilliant, the story-line left me feeling, well, depressed."
1,I wish I had the time back that I spent reading this!,"I generally like Mark Twain's writing, and I love dogs, so I though it would be an enjoyable book. It is not. It is a horrible, horrible book and I will have to spend many a day trying to get the words out of my head. I've almost been thinking that someone must have typed it in wrong, or something happened to the text in order for it to be considered a story in the first place. If you read it expect to be greatly saddened and horrified.Terrible."
1,Get another edition!,"Don't buy this book! The stories, of course, are classic Mark Twain- one of the most thoughtful, humorous, and clear thinking writers ever born. But the Bantam edition is unreadable.To save money, the margins run from 1/4 to 1/8 an inch. Not too bad on the outside edges, but on the inside edge near the spine the words are nearly hidden by the curve of the page. Either you break the spine to read the words, or you are forced to slide your thumb along the inner edge to reveal Twain's words. Find another edition."
4,a dogs tale,a dogs tale is a very good book if i were you i would use the dictionary its mark twain by da way i would read this book if you are a dog lover
5,It works & works well.,"I do little nailing, but I like to salvage usable wood from junk furniture. The nail puller is fantastic, even on headless nails. Couldn't ask for more than that. Buy this and any Shark saw to get over the $25 for free shipping - great deal!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I've purchased loads of stuff from Amazon and have been happy with my purchases. This is my first disappointment. First, I did not receive what is pictured. The tool is ""similar"" but cheaper looking. Second, the ""set"" end of the tool is not round (it's kinda oval - poorly ground), nor does it have a concave end as better nail sets do. It tends to skip off nail heads. I'm into multi-tasking tools. So if all I get for my $ 10 is a mini nail puller - it will sit and rust in my box!For your 10 bucks buy sets made by Starrett $ 10 each - they're perfect."
5,NEATO!!!!,"The highest of quality nailset with a little somthing extra. Can't beat that! I don't use the cats paw much, but it helps me keep up with the tool (I lose alot of nailsets). Read the dimensions - it came a little smaller than expected, but its great just the same."
4,"Modern ""southern rock"" from Seattle","The music on this disc might remind you of late 1970s ""southern rock"", and the vocals definately sound more West Virginia than Seattle, but don't mistake Radio Nationals for a band that is 25 years behind the times. The lyrics are more in line with ""No Depression"" style alt-country bands, which is to say much more adult and interesting than anything on a .38 Special album, and the songs don't sound out of place on a modern ""indie"" or college rock station. Think something along the lines of Kings of Leon. I *love* the voice of the singer; it is such a great Rock singer voice and he uses it well.The standout tracks on this album are Anywhere, Backseat Queen, Black Lung, Golden, See You In New York, and Ghosts In The Room, but none of the songs are weak or ""filler"". Golden and See You In New York would be giant nation-wide radio hits if I were running things :-)"
1,More tired cliches,"More tired cliches from this band of seattle wannabees. The lead singer thinks he's got attitude, when he's really a no talent smoker."
5,"AMAZING, HILARIOUS, CHARMING!!!","Autie Mame was introduced to me when I was only a child. It was a favorite of my mothers. I immediatley picked up on the humour and love it to this day. I am only 23 years old, so it may seem oddd that most 23 year olds are watching classics. The characters are cast perfectly. You must see this movie. It is sophisticated, yet down to earth, and very very funny. I use Mames' colloquialisms are classic, and use them daily. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and long for a flaming martini. I would reccommend it to anyone and everyone."
1,Rosalind Russel is not auntie mame !,"The movie version of Auntie Mame with Rosalind russel was just simply aweful. The acting was bad and the costumes were not accurate,Rosalind Russel was to much to watch.That only my opinion, But I wouldn't recommend this movie. Try lucille balls version of Mame [1974] its much better."
1,Rosalind Russel as Auntie Mame is a big let down!,"Rosalind Russel, is truly bad in this film she over acts and dosen't act classy. This is shameful piece of crap.I would chose lucille balls version its sooooo much better you'll enjoy lucys version alot."
1,Boring !!!,"Rosalind Russell, is overly acting and her timing is off in this movie if you want a good movie with her in try 'The Women'. The 1974 version of mame with Lucille Ball and Bea Arthur is wonderful.Lucille Balls comic talents shine in that movie.Thats alot more than I can say for Rosalind Russell! boring performance!!"
5,I love this movie,This movie is hilarious from start to finish. Rosalind Russell is the perfect person for this role. I have seen this several times and will probably watch it several more yet! This is one of my all-time favorites!
5,Won best costume and set design for a reason,"Check out this hilareous and warm movie. The set design and costumes are incredible. Rosilind Russel is outstanding in this roll. Difficult to find, buy it as soon as you find it. My personal favorite movie of all time. Anyone who loves to entertain will have tons of laughs from this."
5,Simply the Best,"Auntie Mame is the quintessential feel good movie. The story of a flambuoyant Mame Dennis, who takes in her ""little love,"" her nephew Patrick. Rosiland Russell is positively perfect in the role of Mame Dennis. No one could ever do this role as well as she could. Lucille Ball doesn't even come close. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who just wants to find a film with a happy ending."
2,Not as good as Mame,"I watched Mame with Lucille Ball and enjoyed it very much. Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell was such a let down that it has been a struggle to watch the whole film. Perhaps it is because Miss Russell looks like she is acting and Miss Ball IS Mame. Or it could be that there is no music or singing in Auntie Mame, the singing in Mame made it a joy to watch over and over. I doubt that I will watch Auntie Mame a second time."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I just don't get it. I had heard so much about this movie, that I just had to have it. Boy was I disappointed. Not funny. Not entertaining. Just a lot of ""dahling"" this, and ""dahling"" that with no substance. Rent it, but don't buy it. I already gave my copy away."
5,Glorious Auntie Mame,"Auntie Mame is the aunty every child dreams of; she's zany, loveable & outrageous. My kids love it."
5,Auntie Mame,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. Whenever my sister and I get together it is our tradition to watch this movie. Rosalind Russell is Auntie Mame! Everyone should see this movie at least once, preferably many times, in their lives. Auntie Mame is a CLASSIC!"
5,Favorite old movie,All I can say is that this movie is my favorite. Who wouldn't want an auntie like her? You have to see it and then cheer for it. Tell me I'm wrong.
5,one of the best classics around!,"Absolutely hilarious! Amazing costumes, colors and themes! This film is a must see."
5,A classic now available on disc!,Aren't we all glad this one is now available in a format that won't warp in the heat?
5,Fantastic Movie,"Fantastic Movie, it should be in every classic collection. It is so over the top. Rosalind Russell was perfect for this movie"
5,Pickled Rattlesnake?,I absolutely LOVE this movie! It's timeless and classic. I can never get enough of this film! It's just wonderful.
5,Goodtimes,"Remember sitting arround black & white TV and movie when it was in color. In color , movie is as funny as black & white"
5,I brought this with me,"When I learned I was about to be sent to S. Korea for a year of overseas duty, I knew my entertainment options would be few. And as I was allowed a limited amount of personal items I had to judiciously choose what to bring. ""Auntie Mame"" was a definite 'to take' item. No matter how many times I see this movie, I am always thrilled to watch it again. It makes me laugh, lightens my mood, and evokes a bit of the drama queen, or should I say a bit of ""Lady Iris"" in me. It's a masterpiece."
3,"Funny, fun, also a heart grabber at times.","Auntie Mame is a fun movie to watch predominantly, but it will tug at your heartstrings too. There are scenes which are downright hilarious, and scenes that make you just want to cry. I sure don't regret the time, nor the money I spent on the movie Auntie Mame."
3,My how times have changed ... sorta,This movie would have been a great experience for me except for that horribly racist representation of Asian men as protrayed by the characther Ito. Yikes~
4,Auntie Mame,"This entertainment was indeed magic, great humour and acting, withexcellent creativity, colourful and bobmbastic (""Life is a banquet"")and the whole story had GREAT HEART! Would have prefered full screen."
5,Hughes' Masterful Church History,"In an era when curious Catholics must contend with dissident Hans Kung's poor summation of Church history via the Modern Library Chronicles, it's refreshing to know that Philip Hughes' masterful compendium of his three volume work is available on Amazon.com's marketplace.Though unfortunately out of print, the recent success of H.W. Crocker's similarly respectful Chuch history, ""Triumph"", gives hope that some publisher will reissue Hughes' essential book."
1,Lots of static noise,Due to static interference these phones can only be used for AM radio - I would rather use wired headphones than wireless with so much of static.
2,Quality,"Love this item. Exception,,quality. first battery charge failed after only two hours. Now have to use a separate battery charger."
4,Acoustic Research Wireless Headphones,The headphones produce a decent quality when the tuning is set properly. For the money it is a very good buy. The headphones are also comfortable and easy to use.
1,Waste of money,"The Acoustic Research AW-771 gave out when I replaced different rechargeable batteries. I used the headphones just for TV and the 771 was an ok product but experienced long start up times. I purchased the 772 and hate them. Cheap plastic, no range, louding hissing sound, strap above top of head causes discomfort and difficult to insert in rechargeable cradle. Bought the Sennheiser RS12 and most pleased. Returned the junky 772 which is a deplorable product and should be avoided at any price."
5,We disagree with the negative review on these!,"We've used these for several months now and still like them. We have an expensive set we use with our main TV, which we've had for about ten years now. And THESE headphones are comparable to those. They are not $100 headphones, so don't expect them to perform as such. But they are easy to use and have exceptional sound and volume quality.The only negative thing I can say is that they don't always charge the batteries like they're supposed to when the headset is resting in the cradle. That was no biggie to us, because we keep rechargables on hand at all times anyway. But one of sets charges like it's suppose to. We love these headphones and they are very comfortable.We initially only bought one set and tried it out, then returned for two more sets."
1,***HORRIBLE PRODUCT-Will not last more than 2 years,"This unit would fail randomly. Over the past 2 years of owning them, I've had to exchange them twice and it may be a third. The headphones would just quit working without any indication. I've never dropped them or abused in anyway. The components are just poorly built. The headphones are just not worth the money or trouble.Acoustic Research is owned by AudioVox corp. which when it comes down to support; there is none. I've had to replace these headphones twice by swapping out with Amazon already as AudioVox did not respond. AudioVox has won the battle.AudioVox will not back up their work on the headset.Very poorly made, will not last more than 2 years of use."
2,"amazon is great, headphones just OK","These have lots of background noise and cut out. They are fairly comfortable, though do not adjust to a small head. We need them, so they are OK, but I am not impressed. They did arrive very quickly, Amazon was great as usual and cheaper than the store."
1,Lemons,"I have to admit, I purchased these through Amazon for a really good price (less than $30), much less than retail. However, these things suck. They have no range, the sound quality decreases as the batteries drain. They don't go through walls and I have to keep adjusting the channel even sitting right in front of the TV. In all fairness I also have a pair of AW771's that have none of the above problems. Maybe I got a pair of lemons in these AW772's."
3,Teenage pacifier,My 14 year old son bought the headphones and basically has not taken them off. He loves them and walks all over the house and basement listening to his music.
1,Acoustic Research Sux...,There is no way to directly contact Acoustic Research Repair for the wireless headphones very shaddy company. I would be very impressed if anyone can find the number I tried for hours phone and internet..
1,Acoustic Researh Headphones model # AW772,"In July 2006 I purchased a set of aw771 headphones. After using them for 3 weeks I had to return them as the charger would not charge the batteries that came with the headphones. On August 20, 2006, I returned the AW771 headphones and purchased AW772 headphones. I used the new headphones until October 10th. I removed the batteries and unplugged the set as I did not have a need for them until early December. When I was ready to use the headphones again I plugged them in, recharged the batteries and sat down to use them only they wouldn't work. I tried 3 other sets of rechargable batteries to no avail. For both sets of headphones I had to turn my TV volume to maximum to get them to work. I have tried contacting Acoustic Research via Email but have not received an answer. Based on my experience with two different sets of headphones I could not recommend them."
4,SOLID PRODUCTS,"These are the best wireless headphones I found during the time I was shopping (late 06/early 07). I tested Sony wireless headphones and they're mediocre compared to Acoustic Research. The only flaw in these headphones is the bulky over the head strap, it could be slimmer and less funny looking. Other than that, the product does what it says it does."
1,Cannot recommend,"These Model AW772 headphones work OK on a few TV channels most of the time, but they fail to pull in some channels altogether. Automatic tuning is very fast for a few channels, but very slow for others. They sometimes lock onto an unknown channel or other source. The sound is very loud on some channels and very low on others for a given volume setting. Manual tuning is not available although a tuning label appears next to a false knob. Moreover, the instruction manual addresses manual tuning, which apparently was intended for the Model 722, which does feature manual tuning. Batteries never seem to have a full charge or reach full voltage even after 24-hour charging."
3,Good at the price,"Good: recent sound, reasonably comfortable (but I wear glasses, they pinch after a while), good price. Bad: somewhat cheap construction. But my biggest gripe is that it is VERY picky about how the phones must rest in the cradle in order to start recharging, and requires way too much of fussing to get them to sit right. Note: I use these to listen to internet radio via my Mac. When I turn the Mac's volume all the way up and then adjust the sound level with the phones control, hiss and static are greatly reduced. But I must say that after using these for a couple of years I'm starting to itch for a pair of top-notch Sennheisers."
1,Not impressed.,"I've been using these headphones for nearly two years now and am finally irritated enough to write a review. I had to return the first set a week after buying them due to the 'phones failing to charge (apparently a common problem based on reviews). I was hesitant to buy the same model again, but they were the only thing in the price-range. The manufacturer claims that the base will transmit up to 150 feet through walls and floors. In that case, why I am getting horrible static at 20 feet across a room with nothing in between? The auto-tune doesn't seem to make any difference, although tilting and moving my head will help for a bit. When the static clears, the quality of the sound is excellent, too bad the shoddy reception ruins it. I cannot recommend these headphones to anyone."
4,impressed,"This product allows complete comfort and sound. The batteries for the headphones last forever. Volume is completely at the control of the earphone, not the T.V. or other applicable appliance. The T.V. can even be put in the mute positiona and the earphones work independently.The only complaint is that the volume and tone control for the earphones are not easy to locate by touch, especially when the earphones are positioned on your head."
5,A great Song List,"Love lifted me, Face to face, Trust and obey, Just as I am, Holy is the lord medley, God hath provided the lamb, Jesus paid it all, All hail to the power, O for a thousand tongues to sing, When I survey the wondrous cross, Amazing grace, It is well with my soul, Love lifted me, Room at the cross, Great is thy faithfulness, Like a river glorious, All the way my savior leads me, I surrender all, The lord is my shepherd, My Jesus I love thee."
5,Fire & Ice,I've wanted this movie for some time and I was excited that I received it shortly after I ordered it.
4,Mixing elements from swedish folkmusic with symphonic rock,"This is one of the greatest debut albums from the 70's in Scandinavia. I love the sound and the arrangements here. The singer has a very pleasant high voice. Many of the songs have traces of swedish folkmusic here and there. Being a swede I also understand the lyrics, which btw are written in english in the booklet. All of the tracks are favourites here. I only give 4 stars and not five because 1)The next album would be even more tastefully arranged and more explorative 2)There are some silly stuff going on in the last track which i never seem to get passed. Stuff shouted in italian or something...? =P Otherwise, I recommend this and the following album ""Inget nytt under solen""."
4,A good -- not great -- kids' Christmas album,"includes mostly standard favorites, religious and secular, and a few distinctive songs."
4,Raffi wins again,Nice variety of songs. Very upbeat and fun for little ears. Great for sing along. A good teaching tool. Little hands clap along with the music.
3,"Average Raffi, Average Christmas song","There are plenty of better Raffi CDs out there. There are plenty of better Christmas CDs out there. While nothing on this CD was really bad, nothing on it was especially distinctive. While not obnoxious, his style just doesn't seem to fit for most of the Christmas songs."
4,Great for the holidays!,"This has some great holiday songs, but I think Raffi should have a Chanukah album or a Kwanzaa album for people who don't even celebrate Christmas. And the song, ""Comin' Down the Chimney"" should have been on this album as opposed to the More Singable Songs album because the song is obviously about Santa Claus."
5,best kids Christmas CD,"We don't actually love everything Raffi. But we do love this CD. After checking it out from the library, I knew we had to buy this one. My 9 year old still loves it. This is our only Raffi CD, as my kids are mostly out of that stage, but we will keep this one forever."
5,A Must-Have,"I grew up playing this CD along with The Time-Life Treasury Of Christmas albums. This CD also means so much to me is because my dad plays guitar and always played songs for me and my siblings on it. Some of which were Raffi's songs. So, in short, this album reminds me of my father.I find this album great because it's easy to sing along to, it's upbeat, and the songs are original. Nothing over-the-top fancy. It makes it nice because some songs sound like a well prepared Christmas show that you'd hear in a school (lead by the music teacher and accompanied by more than a piano).I recommend this CD to those with kids to those who like folk music. Not all the songs have the kids singing; and there's even a song that's instrumental with some humming (Silent Night/Away In A Manger). So the album by itself doesn't feel like the same song is repeating... and if it does, I recommend to stop playing the album 30 times in a row. ;)"
5,GOOD BOOK,THIS BOOK GAVE ME A GOOD TASTE OF THE S.A.T. IT HELPED ME BECOME USED TO THE TEST SO I WASN'T SO SUPRISED. I ENJOYED IT A LOT
5,ONLY BRAND FOR ME!,"Very warm and comfortable!! Inside and outside in VT snow storms! Fit is true to size! Sporto is EXCELLENT BRAND. I wear mine all day and night, everyday!1st pair I have had for 2yrs. This is the third pair/ STLYE I have boughten. THE ONLY BRAND I WILL EVER BUY AGAIN!! Thank you SPORTO!"
4,Very Pleased,I was very pleased to read this book. I was looking for a book that would accurately tell me the origin of valentines day and the way in which it has evolved. This book did it for me.
5,Flatlinerz - U.S.A. is great. Wow. Oh Wow.,"This cd is very much like the Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Myzery and rap groups like that. It's graphically lyric'd and it has killer beats. It's great for just like, rollin' down the road and hearin' some guy playing Country and just turning Flatlinerz up and makin' that guy roll up his window. I'm speakin' from experience. It's a Must buy for fans of Horror Rap."
3,Dr. Seuss Bulletin Board Set,Don't hang the pieces on white background. It will not stand out. Use a colored background bulletin board paper.
5,Perfect for our Seuss theme'd room!,"I bought this product and had the pieces laminated and they are now hanging up in my nephew's room! Colorful, engaging and the variation of sizes has brought life to his room. Great for kid's rooms and for schools."
5,A delicious meal in itself,"If you love food - and who doesn't? - if you love to try new dishes, go to new and different restaurants as well as your old favorites, if you love to think and talk about food, then you should meet the Gourmet Detective as he helps Hurlington Castle recreate medieval feasts for their guests, and incidentally stumbles across the murder of one of its jousting participants.Was the murder accidental? Or was it meant for the son of the lord of the castle? Was the arrow meant for the lord's daughter? Was the bullet meant for the lord's step daughter?The Gourmet Detective seeks to solve the castle's murders and attempted murders as he finds solutions to the Castle Hurlington's new medieval menus, and along the way we read about food, murders and near murders while being tempted by Peter King's skillful suspense and humor.This is a fun read full of good food, good humor, and a murder and a few near murders - a delicious meal in itself."
4,Give your E550 an 8X telephoto,"I'm using this adapter with the TL-FXE01, which changes my E550 from a 4X zoom to about 8X. Very nice to have when you can't get close enough for a good shot. The mount ring on the camera removes easily and the adaptor goes on with just a twist and a click. The AR/TL combo can really only be used at full zoom, or it's like looking down a dark tunnel with a bright spot at the end. The adapter is about 1.5"" long (the existing camera lense opens up inside it) and the TL is another 1.75"" on the end of that, so the E550 isn't going to fit in your pocket anymore with this on it. I only put it on when I really need it."
2,Belkin Case for Samsung T9,Not exactly what I expected. The fit is very tight. Lanyard broke within a week. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,great compilation,"What is not to like? Every band and every song is awesome! Great live version of James ""Ring the Bells"" like it better than the studio by far!!! I wish they made more like this one! I bought it because of Midnight Oil....but I hope to never lose this one!"
1,BEWARE!,I also love the scent of this fine German bath oil BUT mine was shipped by being put into a bubble wrap/paper mailer. It is a miracle that the glass bottle was not broken. Is that the best that could be done? Very poor....
2,Oooh white noise,"If you love the sound of white noise, this is the product for you! Simply plug into your ipod's headphone jack, tune the iTrip and enjoy! You will enjoy hours of your favorite songs garbled in a tangle of radio broadcasts and static. Spend the extra money and get a direct iPod input."
5,¡ESPECTACULAR!,"el mejor compilado de EXPLOITED ke ai, tienen ke comprarlo 18 temas de los mejores de la banda, aunke faltaron algunos no deja de ser un disco increible, COMPRENLO VIVA EXPLOITED"
4,barmy?!,"Well this is my first Exploited album well what ... can i say........from the First track i thought wow this is different!Its energetic and totally true bad ... punk(as im from scotland it sounds like ""ned punk"")Overall its pretty good every track is different and you just have to play it loudBuy it! its a great intro to the band as it contains some of their best songsTartan Punk rawks!"
1,"Promising concept, shame about the development","This book began with an interesting concept: to compare trends in the old USSR and modern America. The part dealing with the USSR was somewhat one dimensional but made some good points. When examining the USA however the author spoils some valid observations by creating people and situations that become excessive and left rather an unpleasant taste. Knocking down straw men is an easy pastime. The author's obvious point of view, with which I have a little sympathy, is totally negated by the charicatures he has created. This book tries to illuminate some complex and important issues, sadly it only deals with them at a simplistic and facile level."
3,A Different Angle,"This book was not what I had hoped for in that it didn't give the details of the fighting that I was expecting. It is more of an overview of the war with seemingly more emphasis on the pre-war portion. Still, It is an interesting read and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the entire time frame, both pre and post World War Two era."
5,Great Book,"The first hand telling of WWII by a retired 4 star general. Detailed battle discriptions and analysis, and amazing individual encounters. Possibly THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!"
4,More Tasteful Duets from Oscar and the Gray Lions,"If you enjoyed any of the Pablo mid-70's releases featuring some of the big band era's greatest trumpeters accompanied by Oscar Peterson and others, you'll enjoy this collection as well. But like most of these recordings, there are highs and lows. Terry and Edison are mostly superb and as history would bear out, these two had the most years left to treat us with their magic (not counting Faddis of course). Dizzy has some good solos as well but has just as many weak spots and Roy is struggling here to recapture the old magic. But it's still a wonderful collection and as always, no one knows how to make a duet happen like Peterson. Faddis's single solo shows a lot of technique and skill but not much originality. Yet who can really fault him this early in his career surrounded by the masters. Not a 5 star but worth adding to the collection."
3,a quick slapped together greatest hits from Mercury years,"This album shouda been longer and better, he only made 5 albums for Mercury and this is really just a sampler, but they left off so many of the better songs, all and all, not bad, if you like this, buy the rest of the Mercury albums, you'll love them."
2,Weak mixer!,"I was just mixing lemonade powder and water and the push down button mixer broke after the first use! So if you're going to use it, push very gently..."
2,Doesn't last long,"Bought this pitcher to replace an expensive Pampered Chef version that got warped in the dishwasher. For less than $10.00, it's an ok buy. The plunger/mixing mechanism broke after about 3 months, but it did get used almost every day. Just isn't durable enough."
3,Demasiado Bla Bla,El disco está aceptable. Pero en el DVD se nota un tipo poco humilde con un grupo de subditos.
4,"Fun to use and good at slicing, but you can't see what you're peeling!","I got several of these to give as gifts, and they were mostly well liked, but I can tell you a few caveats, too.This thing is very fun to use. It's quite satisfying to peel off a long, clean strip of peel with each stroke. However, you can't see what you're doing, and for certain applications, that matters. Still, this is a nice peeler for quickly making thin slices of cheese, onion, carrot, zucchini or even mango if I'm getting fancy. It would be great for slicing a potato to make your own chips!One other thing that's less than ideal is that a lot of times the peel ends up stuck between the blades, so between strokes I have to turn the veggie and remove the slice of peel. That's a little annoying, but it's still faster and more fun to use than the conventional peeler."
5,WOW!! Amazing Peeler!,"I purchased this for my husband (he's seen an ad for it and mentioned it) and it's wonderful! Easy to use, super sharp and it really cuts down on peeling time. We use it mostly for potatoes and it just couldn't be easier. It's so tiny, you wouldn't think it would work well... but it fits your hand perfectly, is lightweight and so much better than traditional peelers. Oh yeah, it has a nice safety strip you can replace when you store it in your drawer... no accidental cuttings that way!"
5,Kicker Solo Baric L5,Awsome Awsome Awsome. I don't know why they stopped making this sub but I'm sure glad I got one before they are all gone. At the price I paid I almost want to buy another one just to have it saved.
2,A book that i found hard to understand.,"I am fifteen and I don't want to die, written by Christine Arnothy, was an interesting yet very hard book to understand. The author did not give enough detail most of the time about the events that were happening in her life. It was very hard to follow. I found myself putting off reading this novel because my interest just wasn't there. I really would not recommend reading this novel in less you are into difficult reading."
3,Hard to get but Good,"Well i thought the book was hard to get right away. Alought i did eventually get it, I took me a little while to figure out some things. I did have to re-read some comsepts to get the whole picture. But i think this book was good and very well written. And the fact that it really happend to a young girl, amazes me."
3,Hard to Get but Good,"Well I thought the book was hard to get right away. Although I did eventually get the concept (because I re-read parts a lot) i found that it wasn't very entertaining. Now and then, there were good parts but there could be more. The book was short but and the the imput was not for me. I think the reason I didn't like it was, it wasn't of my usuall selection of books. But maybe that was just me.I think this book is for people that like to read stories that take place during wars. But compared to others, this was ok. It was well written but couldn't keep my attention."
4,Engaging,This book gives you a good look into what the people on our police forces go through every day of their lives. Its enough to make a person wonder why anyone would ever decide to do this job.
3,Easy reading true crime,"I guess this is why they say First prize is a week in Chicago, Second prize is two weeks in Chicago. I like this book because it gives a large cross section of a large and rough city's Police department. While there a million yarns about the NYPD, I do believe that for a long period of time Chicago was A LOT rougher than NYC. I believe it has something to do with grinding urban poverty coupled with the influx of all the rural, tiny and poort elements of the American heartland (Tennessee and Kentucky, etc.) coming together. This has always been true of Chicago's history, even from its gangland days, I believe. The stories in the book run the gamut, from dead children, wild shootouts, and bizzare and sadistic murders. This book would send any surbanite fleeing back out of a City. Now in this supposedly 'reduced urban crime epoch' the young should read this book when they head to a hip urban campus and always keep in mind what most U.S. metro areas degenerate to, RATHER QUICKLY."
1,330 pages of anecdotes,"In my opinion, this book is next to useless. The book is suppodded to tell ""what's it really like to be a cop"", but it doesn't deliver. There are lots of stories told by Chicago cops, but these stories are really just anecdotes; the shortest are just one or two sentences long. You just can't tell much in two sentences.Another problem is, the book is arranged in topics. In practice this means that a cop after cop is telling you that ""you don't forget your first corpse"", and this goes on page after page, until the author moves on to another topic. It would be much more interesting, if there were about two or thee dozen stories in the book, each 5-10 pages long that you could read like a short story. But the way this book is written, it simply is not interesting to read, and you don't get much from reading it."
2,Not especially notable.,"It's wonderful that this broad decided to work as a cop to lend her books authenticity, but I don't buy it."
4,The Stuff of Drama,"A few years ago I saw a theater version of this book at the Live Bait Theater in Chicago. I didn't know about the book and thought that the playwright had such a wonderful, creative ear to make the police scene come alive. Connie Fletcher has the gift of capturing the words of actual cops in a way that creates a consisent story and strong drama."
4,very unequal stories,"I gave this anthology a 4 star rating only because of Sherrilyn Kenyon's novella - the first of the three. It's a light hearted romp and had me smiling from beginning to end.I did not like Melanie George's story - too trite - and even Jaid Black, whom I usually like very much, seemed to have run out of ideas in her story. All considered, maybe this book is not worth buying, but I do recommend reading Kenyon if you can get it from your library"
2,Very Disappointing,"The title is very attention grabbing. And Sherrilyn Kenyon is a ""must buy"" for me, and will always remain so. While I usually stear clear of anthologies, with Kenyon's name on the book, I couldn't resist.Romantica, no. Fluff, yes."
1,Don't Bother,"I like all of these authors, but this book had very little to offer in the way of erotic romance. Don't bother"
3,More Pop than Dance,"I am a great fan, but this is not one of Donna Summer's more memorable albums. It is well produced by Michael Omartian but lacks the timeless songs that are found aplenty on her better works.There Goes My Baby is a pleasant ballad where her voice gets a chance to soar, but most of the tracks sound very similar. The style is a kind of 80's Pop/R&B; without the dance beat. The torch song Forgive Me has lovely piano and the title track is vaguely sensual, while the opening number Supernatural Love is embellished with impressive synth infusions.But overall, the album is rather tepid and lacks spark. It is with a measure of reluctance that I award it a third star. Perhaps it deserves only two and a half. I recommend the albums Bad Girls and Once Upon A Time to those wishing to hear Donna Summer at her peak."
3,Lukewarm,"I am a great Donna fan, but this is not one of Summer's more memorable works. The album is well produced by Michael Omartian but lacks the timeless songs and gripping melodies that are found aplenty on her better albums.There Goes My Baby is a pleasant ballad where her voice gets a chance to soar, but most of the tracks sound very similar. The style is a kind of 80's Pop/R&B; without the dance beat. The torch song Forgive Me has lovely piano and the title track is vaguely sensual, while the opening number Supernatural Love is embellished with impressive synth infusions.But overall, the album is rather tepid and lacks spark. It is with a measure of reluctance that I award it a third star. Perhaps it deserves only two and a half.

5,Works for iPhone 4S in Otterbox Defender,"This product works perfectly for an iPhone 4S in an Otterbox defender case. The one downside is the stand portion that ships replaces your current dock insert, and that part does not clip in correctly. This is not a big deal because the extender holds it down."
3,Does not charge the ipod,Adapter did not keep continuous contact even with the back stablizer. Also when using the adapter my ipod did not charge. Sent item back for refund.
3,"Able to use with case, but not too well.","Pros: for the most part, can dock ipod nano 2gen with case, though it's too fat and pushes the case halves apart to seat properly. This causes the extender to get pinched and stay with ipod when ipod removed from dock.Cons: Waaaaay too expensive for what it is, though without competition on the market... it's the only way to go.I had mine fall apart when I gently pulled on the housing to remove it from the white ipod cable. I had forgotten to press the sides of the oem white cable and the guts slipped right out of the plastic housing. This was my mistake, but I wasn't pulling that hard. Fortunately, I was able to bend the foil shilding back in place for the most part and put it back together. Glue would be a great idea.All in all, it does the job, but just barely."
1,Does not work with Lifeproof Iphone Case,I just received the dock extender and it does not work with the LifeProof case. Has anyone gotten it to work with the Lifeproof case? It does not seem to be long enough to reach the phone.
5,"expensive, but does the job","hated to spend this much money to do this job, but it does actually work. i did not want to remove the nice case from my iPhone every time i put in the charger (plus it was a pain to do), so I broke down and got this. it is really easy to us and the back rest prevents any damage to your iPhone or the connections."
5,gorgeous,Its great pleasure watching shannon tweed. Iam obsessed with shannon tweed. I feel happy watching her.
4,INCREDIBLE!,I think that this is the best movie that Streisand has ever made. Her acting was superb! If you want to see a great movie rent this one. END
1,Barbra's Worst,I love Barbra Streisand and I couldn't believe just how bad this movie was. I was very disappointed but would have bought it anyway to add to my collection.
3,a Compelling performance,I give this film 3 stars but I give Barbra Streisand 5 stars. Her performance is so incredibly touching and honest. It has to be the one Stresand movie where I actually forgot the star. She's just stunning. I'd love to have seen Streisand in more of these low-budget movies that deal with very real issues - such as the roll and importance of the American housewife. Streisand is a fantastic actress and this movie proves it.Joanne
4,Wow,"This movie came as a total surprise to me. I've seen every Streisand movie and this one is the one that stands out the most. Not because it's the best but it's the most...strange? ...unique? Barbra fits the role perfectly. It shocks me how beautiful she was at that age. She looked amazing! She does such a broad range of acting in this movie. A tiny bit of action, some comedy, drama, romance. She can do it all. My favorite scene is the one where she fights with her mother. That scene is hilarious! This movie is all over the place and it probably would be better if it chose one path to follow but it still works. My biggest complaint is the editing. There's a lot of footage that should have been cut out like the family film scene. That was just boring."
1,...... I only have 1 thing to say...,"seriously what are you doing?!!!!!! you have distroyed music for me get a LIFE!!! When bullets fly what where you smoking when you wrote this i have never heard so much drivle like omg dance of kavala, when bullets fly sounds as if a mentally retarded hick wrote it in 10 mins you sir are a discrace to the music industry!"
3,A Biased Viewpoint,"Michael and I have known each other since I was 5 years old, so it is impossible not to be biased on his work. He is a long term friend and former band mate. He also taught me alot about playing the guitar and writing guitar solos. I would compare this work to Santana's ""Supernatural"" album. It is creative and goes in many directions. You can sample his influence on PT & The Ghost Notes album, ""I Know What I Want"" on the ghostnotes web site."
3,The Gold Rush,"This is a question for Amazon and reviewers. I love City Lights. I also like The Kid, The Gold Rush and The Great Dictator. Those are the only movies by Charlie Chaplin which I have seen and I suppose if I saw others I would like them too.Here is the question: I saw the original versions of City Lights and The Gold Rush on the Internet for free. Why should I buy DVDs? What is the point of giving a DVD as a gift if the person to whom you give the gift could see the original version on the Internet?Thank you for your consideration.Stevensross@whitecase.com"
5,The Gold Rush,"I agree with one of the reviews above. Go right to the second disc and see the film as it originally appeared. Fantastic! (The first disc with the narration is very nice, but the narration is totally unnecessary). The film still holds up beautifully and the prints of this whole collection are amazing. Particulary if you've never seen this film, the best one to watch is the second disc original release. You won't be sorry!!!"
5,"After eating a boot, giant chicken shoots bear from cabin....","Definitely Chaplin at his peak (more like plateau, which lasted through The Great Dictator), especially the '42 version which trims it down some with Chaplin doing the narration and some dialog. The print looks better than ever (on blu-ray) and the extras are about as good as it gets....great special effects for the time period, great score, great story.... Criterion is the way to go with this one--no need to know what it's about--just get it....very few films are at this level of quality....everything works perfectly....then see his silent talkies, City Lights and Modern Times...."
5,Eternal,"This film contains so many timeless skits it isn't even funny!(I mean this film is, it's - well, you know!)C'mon, you dream about being in a log cabin and the guy next to you turns into a chicken!You dream about eating your leather shoes and you imitate the dance of the dinner rolls when nobodys looking!What im trying to say is that this is one of those films that no matter how many viewings, the lighthearted humor and charming sountrack never die.You can't kill Charlie Chaplin, he's already dead."
2,Give us the original !,"I was really looking forward to getting this, my favorite Chaplin movie, on DVD, but now I think have to get rid of it again, I'm afraid. The picture quality is nice enough for such an old film (hence the 2 stars), but unfortunately this is not the original version but the lame one Chaplin re-released. Here's what's wrong with it: Chaplin un-necessarily narrates the story, the ending is different, the titlecards are removed, or rather, it looks more like the picture was blown-up cropping the sides of the picture !. This is not the movie I love. Somebody apparently thought: ""well, if Charlie himself changed it this must be the director's cut, therefore we'll release this version"". How wrong they were. We want the superior, and longer, original silent version !. Chaplin fans rebel !."
5,Won't drive you to the brink of psychosis,"Unlike most other children's music, Raffi is actually fairly tolerable for adults who have to hear each album over 40,000 times. It will not drive you to a psychotic state as will other kiddie favorites like a large purple thing which will remain nameless. Raffi's singing and playing are quite good--from an adult standpoint, he's a pleasant folksinger who sings children's material. He has a charm about him which really appeals to the children, which is lacking in something like the Jerry Garcia/David Grisman album for children. Raffi's sort of charm is not corny or overbearing, so adults will not want to run into the street screaming. All in all, he's the ideal artist if you have children under five and hope to keep a shred of your sanity, music--wise. For that I say, Thank God for Raffi!"
5,Simple Fun,"My 2-old-son, who isn't much of a TV watcher, is enthralled with this video. The video proves that even in today's animation climate an artist doesn't need to resort to a lot of ""bells and whistles"" to capture a child's attention. A simple stage and few props, make Raffi and his songs centerstage. It's so nice to see the kids in the audience having a good time -- it doesn't even matter that the video is somewhat ""dated."" All in all, a nice way to let a child (and a parent) relax and unwind."
5,Raffi Charms Babies,"This is a terrific CD for riding in a car with infants and toddlers. Raffi is very soothing and seems to be on the wave length of babies and young childern. He has the same effect as Mr. Rogers did except Raffi sings catchy kids songs with a guitar background. The songs may bore adults after awhile but the babies never seem to tire of them no matter how many repetitions. He worked for our kids and hasn't lost any effectivenenss on our 9-month old granddaughter. I highly recommend him for day or night time, long trips, or just running around town."
1,Don't buy it.,"I got this player because I really wanted to play some of my parent's old records, but I have been VERY disappointed with my purchase. It looks fantastic, and if that's all you're going for, then you should buy it immediately. If you want to play anything on it, then go for another player. The record player is made of the cheapest plastic possible. Mine broke after about a month and a half (of light use!). The radio worked well for about 2 months, but now it's 50% static, 50% music. I don't know if I just bought a ""lemon"" or what, but if you really want to buy this, I would definitely suggest keeping all of the boxes, wrapping paper, and receipts, because if you get one similar to mine, you're going to want to get your money back."
5,Great CD/Record player,"I got this for my husband as a gift about 2 years ago, and it's still going strong.The stackable part is kind of fun, but we are afraid that our records might be damaged being stacked like that, so we don't use it.The record player also replays your record so there's no silence.CD player works great, radio works. Looks very authentic, even though it's definitely not an antique. Overall, pleasantly surprised."
4,Good but heavily US slanted,"Dennis Kux gives a very good history of diplomatic relations between the US and Pakistan, including analysis of the bigger global politics picture. However, this is mostly from the US point of view. Not as dry as many similar books."
5,Yellowjackets is a Winner!,"In this gripping account of the exploits of the 361st Fighter Group, Paul Cora has capture the danger and excitement of the air war over Europe. This is a ""must read"" for anyone who loves P 51s. The pictures alone are worth the price of the book."
4,unit history,"I needed this history for the museum I work at, this satisfied that requirement.This unit has been part of the Michigan Air Guard for 65 years"
4,always good,its Reba and Reba is always good.This is one that i had not heard of so i got it and some of the songs had not heard her do before there are other cd's Reba has out that i would say are better she has alot of really great ones but this is all reba too so works great for a Reba collection
4,Historically fascinating,"The attrractions of this set are 1) it is a fine example of the four-square approach to Verdi still prevalent in the '50's, in many ways rendered here at its best; and 2) splendid singing by the main characters, the soprano Anita Cerquetti and tenor Pier Miranda Ferraro. Judged by this performance, they could hold their own with most of their contemporaries. The sound, for a live recording made fifty years ago, is not bad, only occasionally does one have the feeling that the soloists are singing into a half full rain barrel and sometimes the relative miking of the performers is bothersome. The producers obviously do not expect this to be one's main recording of La Forza. The booklet contains the cast and the list of tracks and virtually nothing else, though the box does mention the exact date of the performance. Overall, an enlightening version of the opera which is artistically more than a match for many others still prominent in the catalogue."
2,Intriguing for the selections if not the execution...,"Titled after one of Cat Stevens more obscure cuts, Simon commits a solid vocal effort to arrangements that are so ethereal they might float away into space; much less grab your attention. It's an intriguing mix of traditionals like ""Oh, Susanna"" and ""Scarborough Fait"" with covers of James Taylor, the aforementioned Stevens and The Beatles, but the execution is just not compelling. All the songs are set against such a delicate sound that only Simon's vocals are left to interest the listener and after awhile that is not enough and by the time I got To ""I gave my Love A Cherry,"" I know why Bluto broke that guitar. It's pretty, but also instantly forgettable."
1,Song Selection,"I bought this CD because I like Carly's voice but was dissapointed with the song selection, it seemed like I was listenning to a CD of nursery rhymmes. However the music arrangements were good.Very dissapointed and threw the CD in the bin."
4,"One star short of wonderful due to the awkward mixture of song styles, BUT...","if you are a long-time fan, like me, and you appreciate Simon's sensuous side, her mom side, her folky side, and her Great American Songbook side, this one will please you. To place ""Oh, Susanna"" and ""I Gave My Love a Cherry"" alongside ""Over the Rainbow"" took guts. Simon's voice, however, is wonderful in all the genres here, and the help from her adult children comes off well also. ""You Are My Sunshine"" judging by titles alone, ought to fit with ""Rainbow"" but I doubt anyone ever tried that before. I do most of my listening while driving around a city of 130,000 people with just enough traffic to be annoying and to require attention, so having CD's playing that can be ignored every few moments is essential to my sanity. This one qualifies, and I'll play it quite a bit during my workday. This is an album that will grow on you if you give it a chance."
1,A horrible disappointment,"Fortunately, I took advantage of auditioning the public library's copy of this before I placed an order for it. I looked forward to listening to this CD after having really enjoyed her earlier ""Moonlight Serenade"" CD. My first impression of this was that it was for playing in a baby's nursery. Perhaps that was the point, but the library's copy didn't have any of the liner notes to offer any explanation of the song choices. I didn't find anything here that I even found remotely interesting. Only recommended for ages 3 and under."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZ,Carly couldn't have selected a worse bunch of songs to cover. Oh Suzanna...come on now! Same dull monotone throughout the cd. One redeeming feature it may get your youngsters so bored they will fall asleep quickly at bedtime.
3,"Not Carly's best, but still good","Carly Simon and her family sing some old favorites. Not her best effort, but still entertaining. Nice music with some unique touches to some oldies."
2,M. Georges,I expected much better from Carli Simon . She sounds like a singer that should have taken a bit of rest instead of winging it on the strengh of her reputation.
2,Sorry but it's SO BORING,"I'm not too much younger than Carly and have been a fan for years. Her voice still sounds lovely but this album is a real yawner - and not because it's supposedly a collection of lullabies (Oh Susanna as a lullaby??? Please!). There's no energy here, no creative arrangments - just a monotonous collection of covers. The prettiest song by far is Quiet Evenin' because there's a little originality there. Then there's the problem of who this album is aimed at. Adults? Kids? I wish she had just made a nice collection of sweet songs for children which would have made far more sense then this disappointment."
1,How The Mighty Have Fallen....,"A friend at work let me listen to her copy of this disc. Oh My! Where to start? The choice of songs was poor and the performance was maudlin. Each song sounds basically the same. There is hardly any emotion being conveyed here. Bringing her children into the mix wasn't a wise choice either. The song, ""You Can Close Your Eyes"", by her ex-husband is a case in point. Someone is singing off-key in the backround. Sorry, the son and daughter don't have their parent's talent. I could picture James Taylor singing his own version of the song. There is just no comparison of his singing this tune to this mess of an album. I gave Carly one star because of what she has done in the past. This really deserved a big, fat zero."
1,Dissappointing,"There is only one song on this CD worth listening to : ""You can close your eyes"". All other songs make Carly's voice sound sad, crackly, out of tone, and emotionless. She should avoid solo performances and stick to harmony with her children."
1,pathetic!,This is an album that Carly Simon seems to have put together just to have something to make an album out of. Unbeliveable. Bought it and gave it away. Does not do the name Carly Simon justice. Her other music is so well written and beautiful. Also can't figure out when I would play this due to the large range of music included.
1,Disappointed to the Max,"When I heard Carly had a new CD called Into White, I ordered 3 of them because I always loved her voice. When I listened to the CD, I was truly disappointed. My wife hated it, and so did everyone else that I tried to give the CD to. I sent the two unopened CDs back to Amazon and threw the other one in the trash. Two weeks later, I read an article in Business Week and the author of the piece was talking about how wonderful Into White was. I disliked the CD so much, I had to write a rebuttal to his story. Don't order this CD, IT IS AWFUL."
2,Into White Carly Simon A LETDOWN,"Voice is the same it always was-- The standards are not well served by her rendition of them. The musical score on these tracks tries to hard to feature her voice and much is lost inn the meaning of the song. Some of the new songs are pleasant to listen too, but are not that outstanding."
3,"Hmm, a little disappointed??","Carly's new CD is, to put it generously, listenable! However, I was expecting a little more from her latest CD. I loved listening to Moonlight Serenade, her previous CD, which is a collection of classic love songs. I must have worn out that DVD/CD for I played it non-stop since February of last year.This CD is OK but it's not great. At least, from me. I wish I could have been more generous with my review because Carly Simon is one of the great singers of our time. However, I have listened to the CD 3 times and it never got better!"
1,"WARNING,DO NOT PLAY IN YOUR CAR","I ADORE Carly Simon.I will to the end of my life.She has given me great pleasure over the years with her wonderfull music,and I know she is one of the the nices artist out there,and I have met her in person,and she was.""Into White"" is so boring,except for the first track,""Into White.""This is the only song I play Over and Over again.Its BEUTIFULL.The rest fo the record takes alot of patience to listen to .(Wait untill you get to the ""LaLa"" cut.Thats the entire track}There are a couple of songs I enjoy,but they would be the cuts you would have for fillers on a regular album.The voice is still beutifull,but ""Into White""is probally the least of my favorite records from this GREAT ARTIST."
4,Great Covers for Many Songwriters,"Carly Simon is one of those artists I wait for. This one does not disappoint. I'm sure there will be some who would prefer a louder album, but this one is great because it mixes really old songs with covers for our contemporaries with a few surprises also in store. I especially enjoyed her duets with her son Ben."
5,Soothing sweet Carly,"After getting the soundtrack for Piglets Big Movie, I thought for sure we would also enjoy this album and we do. This is another I add to our ""go to sleep"" selections. Carly's remakes of some of the oldies are really special. My children love singing along and it makes them feel peaceful and sound before slumbering."
5,Sweet and gorgeousl,"Carly!!!!!!!!!!You are unique and sweet!My god! My ears cannot believe the soothing beauty of this work.It is so wholesome yet diverse.Just allow yourself to inmerse into MANHA DE CARNAVAL and JAMAICA FAREWELL which can transport you to faraway lands in an ethereal and jazzy guise.Carly!!!and then you have the version of YOU CAN CLOSE YOUR EYES with the children.You listen to OH,SUSANNAH.....just keep on singing ,Carly!"
4,Is it 1972 Again?,"It feels like it, after taking a first listen through ""Into White."" As a longtime Carly Simon fan, I was initially attracted to songs like ""Julie Through The Glass,"" ""Anticipation,"" and ""That's The Way I've Always Heard it Should Be."" And after many detours trying to stay relevant and sell records, Carly has returned to exactly the kind of introspective and ethereal music she made her name with early on. I don't think there's a track on this cd that I don't love. Where ""Moonlight Serenade"" felt like the marketing departments' idea, this record is hearfelt, and a great showcase for a really great interpreter of popular music. If you're a fan of Carly Simon, buy this cd. For those writing about how boring it is, did you look at the song list before you bought it??"
4,Enjoyable treatment of old favourites,Carly puts her unique stamp on these songs. Worth adding to your collection.
4,"""Wings Over America"" shows the band could really rock","For Christmas 1976, Wings released the triple live set of their most triumphant tour. Most of the material is from ""Band On The Run"", ""Venus And Mars"", and ""Wings At The Speed Of Sound"", as well as a few Beatle hits. The band here comes off rocking harder than their studio albums would lead you to believe, and you often can't help but remember what the excitement was all about then. A great show."
4,McCartney's Best Live Album,"Paul's best live album back when he was still rocking. Unlike any of the live albums that followed, Paul and the band sound fresh and spontaneous and less like a tribute band playing old songs. The best lineup of musicians that he has ever played with makes this the live McCartney album to get."
5,Remaster CD Coming Fall 2011?,"this original 3 lp set was one of the best live albums released in the 70's and to date. i recently listened again to a mp3 downland of it and realized after listening to it for the first time since scrapping my turn table years ago just how good it is. more distorted guitars than on the studio releases of the songs (beware my love etc) and jimmy McCullough on guitar (medicine jar was always a wings favorite of mine) this album had it all. this being said the album is supposedly set for a 2011 remaster release according to sources as part of the ""Archive Collection"". rumors have it releasing some type of dvd(s) along with it, whether it is of the full concert or not is not known."
4,A Classic Record,"I wanted to see this tour so bad. Being only 10, I could not go. I listend to this album so much. I just gave it a listen after a long time, and it stands up to time. If you are a Paul McCartney fan, this is a must to own."
4,Not really Paul at his best live...,"the opening medley of Venus and Mars/Rock Show/Jet and the 4 song encore of Letting Go, Band On the Run, Hi Hi Hi & Soily, are the only real highlights of this recording.TRIPPING THE LIVE FANTASTIC captures Paul live much better. If only for the killer live version of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.So, if you want to hear Paul really good live get TRIPPING first. Then get this. And forget about the other live releases. Especially PAUL IS LIVE. This and TRIPPING are the only 2 live recordings by Paul you'll ever need.GREG"
2,Why is this not available for download?,This is one of the best Wings recording - I especially like Picasso's Last Words - Richard Cory. But all I have is the original scratched up album my sister bought in '77. Why can't I purchase the mp3s from Amazon. C'mon!
5,wonderful. As I remembered it.,This is a hard to find album. Wonderful album. Just as I remembered it. Not available on iTunes. Thanks for making it available.
5,Love this show!,"I love this show. It is really great, they really do try their best to help people whether the issue ends up being paranormal or not. This show is so much more worthy than Ghost Hunters. I would love to see more and more from this group!"
2,Uhhh...,"Ok, I took my chances on buying this movie without seeing it first because I am an Elijah Wood fan and was interested to see him in a role that's not Frodo. He played off his awkward character quite well, but it was almost painful to watch because I was embarrassed for the kid. Actually, most of the characters were awkward. Maybe that was the intention, but there were some VERY strange moments that I didn't expect. I just expected more from the movie, and after watching it, it seemed empty."
2,All I want is to return this movie,"I have to admit, I bought this movie because I am an Eli fan. And he was good in this but his character was very weird and frankly disturbed. The movie has very little plot or point and far too many daydream sequences. It is rather stupid and very boring. Rent it before you buy it!"
4,Cool,I loved this movie. I really don't know why. I just saw it and all my friends thought it was stupid but I liked it. This was a movie about love that just kinda played with your mind. The end of the movie left a lot of questions to be asked but I like movies like that. All and all the story was good and the acting was ok (they could have gotten better actors but hey no movie is perfect.)
2,No Point,"I watched All I want, and it was all I wanted. It's a film with weird characters, the weirdest was Wood's fantasy imagination. The movie goes nowhere and is a 93 minute mess."
2,"eh, it was ok","to be honest, i rented this movie about a year ago and don't remember anything except that it was just okay. actually, i don't remember it being that great at all - maybe even trying a little too hard to be artsy-fartsy. but i'll tell you what, that frodo is a cute little guy!"
4,very entertaining,"What initially drew me to this movie was that I saw the trailer that was included on the ""Raising Victor Vargas"" DVD (another good coming of age story-check it out if you already haven't). I was intrigued by Jane, the character portrayed by Franka Potente. I loved her in ""Run Lola Run"" and ""the Princess in the Warrior"", but I didn't know she had done English speaking roles as well, like Johnny Depp's girlfriend in ""Blow"". I'm really looking forward to whatever she happens to do next. I liked the scenes between her and Elijah Wood. Mandy Moore shows potential of developing into a serious actress. It was also nice to see Deborah Harry turn an interesting perfomance as well. I might have to order another copy being that I've watched it over and over again."
2,Frodo finally gets some,"This is a pretty poor romantic comedy/coming of age film, with all the conventions that you would expect: broken home, overly sensitive boy, wise older woman friend, rampant fantasies, etc etc. I really didn't find anything about it very interesting, with the exception of how his relationship with his mom evolves. But the silliness and frivolous ticks throughout the film never worked for me. All in all, I felt like it was a waste of time.Not recommended."
4,Reading too much into it...,"I think people read too much into this movie. I don't see it as a coming of age story or a teeny bopper flick. I mean let's face it, the only teeny bopper is Moore and she plays one of the older women. Granted the story line isn't the best, but the characters are amazing. You got a young dreamer played by Wood who is not satisfied with what the world is handing him and finally does something about it. There is a striving actress who is not good at all and it shows in her all around character. Then there is the mysterious photographer/artist who is a little freaky, but then a door opens into her life and we see her for what she really is. I really don't think the fact that Wood plays a seventeen year old should be relevant. It only says that seventeen is usually the age where your life makes its first drastic changes. I for one loved the change that Dillon and his mom had towards one another throughout the movie."
2,Don't waste your time...,"All I Want looked like a promising movie with fresh bright actors, but instead was a ""Teen"" plot with the same mindless drivel as many other teen movies. The seventeen year old Jones is a similar character to Igby in the movie Igby Goes Down, the only difference being Jones stays a virgin. Don't waste your time or your money on All I Want."
3,All I Want,""" All I Want"" is okay for a movie about a young college student just starting his first year.It is not my favorite Elijah Wood movie.It is a big change from ""Lord of the Rings"". I suppose it was his first roll as a romantic lead. I would recommend it more I think for younger people than myself, like teens and early twenties."
1,one of Mandys worst movies,"This movie was one of Mandy Moores earliest movies. Her acting was good, she looked real good, and she gets turned down, get real directors, not likely to happen in real life. Franka Potente looks too old and too hard for this movie. The story is weak and unrealistic, Elija is ok, but plays the part of a stupid dude. Don't waste your money, unless you just want to see how a bad script is made into a bad movie."
5,Classic tale of witchcraft ..,"I really enjoyed this play even though it was a class assignment. It gives you a feel of this huge chunk of our worlds history that no one can fully understand. I wasn't really into ready anything of this sort, but it was really cool. I liked it a lot :)"
2,"Good condition, but already written in","The product itself comes nicely, but there is alraedy writing and highlighting in the novel, which is a major bother when reading it"
2,Hard to understand,I bought this so my learning disabled students could read along in class with the play. However the sound is so low and the actors speak way too quickly for them to understand.
3,it is ok,"I read this book a long time ago, however I still remember this book and the impact it had on me. It was difficult for me to get through this book. I did not like the concept of other people being able to call other witches for their own profit. I thought the main character in the book was vengeful."
3,Boring\Interesting,It is interesting in some parts like the beginning and the end because it has to do with witchcraft and hocus-pocus. Some parts in the middle are also interesting. All the dialogue parts were so boring. I only like this book because of the mystery.
5,Best play I've read in years!,"I absolutley loved this play. I recently re-read it and it was incredible. It's not very long, and it is definitly something everyone should read. You feel like your at the trials, and you can just see the wretched abigail..Buy it, borrow it, get it from the library. just read the play."
2,The Play and Joe McCarthy have Nothing in Common,"Have not read the book or seen the play. However, in reviewing the item in light of the fact that the local High School is putting on the play, I am struck by a common theme many of the other reviewers have touched upon. That being some common thread between witch trials and Joe McCarthy. McCarthy was many things, many of them bad. However, the substance of his claims were far more right than wrong. America, including many high offices in the government, of the 1940's and into the early 1950's was substantially infiltrated by Communists. That fact is provable by records opened to the public after the fall of the USSR."
2,An unsatisfying read.,"""The Crucible"" is about a fascinating time in America's early history: The Salem Witch Trials. I found that Miller portrayed everyone as being naive and at times childish, and I found myself focusing on the utter stupidity of events, rather than the complexity of the characters. Until the fourth act, I found myself bored and frustrated. But, the pace picked up by the last act, and true drama surfaced. With very little stage direction, I cannot be fully taken with this play. I think it would have been better as a novel, as that is how it currently reads. You could write a good character analysis, once you get past the yearning to scream at the characters about how wrong they are. But other than that, this play is somewhat of a letdown. I do not recommend."
4,"say no ""what"" you fool!","The whole movie and book were a wondiful discription to what itwas in real life but whoever says that this was a bad and wastful book is very disturbed in the mind and sould get my and ""Miss Cleos"" profestional help! also if you even thought this was a great book but have troubl with family friends or mates please call me!"
3,Review on the Crucible,"The Crucible is great step into the past. the hardships that the people of salem, massachusetts endured, which were due to witchcraft must have been horrifying. everyday, people were accused of being the devil's advocate. the book itself lets the people of today know that we have to use common sense and not get caught up in the mass histeria. we should be able to realize that mass histeria is highly overrated and never gets anyone, anywhere. if people would actually stop and think about what they are doing, mostly all the misfortunate things that happened in or to this country would have never happened in the first place. it all comes down to using the brain we have and how well we use it without jumping to conclusions."
3,a review of The Crucible,"The play The Crucible is a good play to read in a class room setting, but not fun reading on your own. It is made like this because of it's play written format, which makes it difficult to read, and comprehend by tour self. However, in a class room setting, The Crucible is better then most assignments. In the play, there is the ever present theme of the accused putting the blame on others. By the end of the play, a Massachusetts judge is brought in too make an attempt to secure the justice brought upon the many accused witches. Even though this play is decent, the whole thing can be summed up by a skit performed by Monty Python in the movie The Holy Grail."
4,the review,"I think that ""The Crucible"" is a good book. It was a bit hard for me to follow because of the type of text used (middle english). I really got into the book though because of the suspence and all of the surprises and twists that Miller wrote."
2,Better for Drama Students,"This book is an alright book to read, if you were acting it out in Drama. If the book was written in regular form, then it would be good for the classrooms. This book was interesting to read but hard to understand. You had to some what jump back and forth between people talking. I feel for the people who had to be put in the concentration camps, and were forced to work against their will just to keep their family members alive. I do not think that people have a right to degrade other humans beings of their own kind or culture."
4,political witchcraft...not unlike today,"As relevent today as in Miller's time. Human nature doesn't change, no matter how we try. Power corrupts, and young women can always find a man to manipulate. Overall a good read."
4,the movie was grest and i enjoed it.,the crucible was very intersting. abigail is quite an interesting charaacter.
3,Lost in Mail,"This item was lost in the mail; however the dealer did refund my money, so I'll call it even. Can't really give any rating though."
3,Just an Okay play....,"Having just read The Scarlet Letter before The Crucible, I found The Crucible less mature and more of anarchic play. It was difficult to follow at times when there are many characters in one scene.I thought the twist in the plot at the end very surprising and it reveals that not just women are prejudiced for witchcraftery, but men too. Miller's organization of character importance was slightly off balance as he considered some of the more innocent characters such as Abby more important than John Proctor (although he does appear often in the play but the urgency to keep him the spotlight just wasn't there)"
1,Hard to Understand...too confusing!!,This book didn't help me in the least bit. I tried and triedto see if I could understand this book but it just wasn't enough. Theplot is basically the same throughout the story with people justaccusing each other of witches which I thought was pretty lame. I didhowever like the ending but the ending won't make my rating go up to 2stars. This book is harder to understand than a Shakespeare novelwhich to me is extremely hard. I wouldn't recommend this book toanybody.
1,Please don't co-mingle different readings,All of these reviews appear to apply to the L.A. Theater Works reading of The Crucible. I wanted to read reviews about the Lincoln Center version. Co-mingling can be confusing. The Lincoln Center is unabridged and the reviews for the L.A. Theater Works make it sound abridged. I wonder if this review will end up in the L.A. Theater Works version reviews as well.
4,"Bart is a vampire, Abigal is a witch....","this play was really well constructed. It portrayed the characters well back then. It had the radical people that accused left and right. It also had the priests, the judges, the weird suspects and the one noble person. It kept my attention through the whole time. It had very good description of the characters personality that made me keep on reading. The end has a weird twist that makes you wonder if it was a joke or just spooky. overall a good rating of four out of five stars."
4,Assumption the Ultimate Deceit,"After reading ""The Crucible"" by Arthur Miller I've begun to realize the importance of children's actions. Assumptions can lead to anything, even death. In ""The Crucible"" Abigail a young beautiful girl terrorizes a peaceful town in Salem, MA. She accuses her fellow residents of witchcraft, which sparks a fire of assumptions made by the high and mighty factions of the town. These factions are thirsty for greed and land. They'll do anything to acquire land, leaving even the holiest in the community to trepidation. Abigail brings upon an accusation upon John Proctor her one-time lover. He provails morally in his quest to save his family name."
5,A modern classic,"This is a truly great play, and what is even better - it is an easy to read great play. I know that it is held up as an allegory for McCarthyism, and that it is studied for that, but as a play it is powerful and emotive without the symbolism. The fact that it refers to real events gives it more of a punch. It is well written, the characters are wonderful, and all in all it is a very worthwhile read."
3,"Good message, a little slow","I had to read this book for my English class. The book would be much better if we lived in the time that it was supposed to satirize, the 1950's. Arthur Miller depicts the McCarthy era by using the Salem witch trails which is a very effective way of showing the the insaness of McCarthy's ways. The Salem ""Witches"" portray McCarthy's ""communists."" It is a good book, but at times it is a little slow and you must trudge on through the book. Overall pretty decent book."
2,Ok Book,"It was an ok book. Some parts were interesting, but some parts were left to be desired. It was a bit complicated too, too many characters, kind of hard to follow along. But other than that, it was pretty good."
4,On the subject of symbolism in 'The Crucible',"I enjoyed this play very much. Although historically relevant to the salem witch trials in my opinion this play's meaning had little to do with them. What I see Miller focusing on is more the symbolism of the events transpiring within and their relation to modern events (e.g. The Mcarthy Trials). While portraying what happened in Salem during that era, what Miller is focusing on and what he try's to inform you he is focusing on is how he feels it relates to the times in which he lived. Not as a historical account, but dealing with the act's of propoganda, lie's, and how gullible people are to be drawn into a web of deceit such as portrayed within the play"
1,Hard to follow along,"I bought this cd set to read the play along with my students. It's very theatrical and there are a lot of sound effects. The actors go so fast, that it's hard to follow along if you're reading the play. There's a lot of mumbling, sighing, heavy-breathing. Anyway, if you are wanting to just listen to it, this is a great purchase. If you want to read along, I would try a different cd set."
4,A great read of the play by professionals,"The L.A. Theatre Works' rendition of Miller's _The Crucible_ is an excellent demonstration of the actor's craft, as the tenor, pitch and emotive power of the play bring the characters to life. On the recommendation of Amazon reviewers, I used this for my English class (in addition to the Daniel Day-Lewis / Winona Rider DVD and a class read-around) to get a feel for the play and the various theatrical interpretations of the work.As a previous reviewer noted, there are some differences between the audio version and Miller's script, but they are minor, and if one is not using the entire CD, a moot point. The performances are fantastic, and, as others have mentioned, it certainly gives life to the written word. Outside of a classroom, I couldn't recommend it, but as a teaching tool, it is first-rate."
1,"Stop breathing into the mic, please.","I was hoping to use this in my 11th grade class to go along with the text of The Crucible, but there's just no way. The readers certainly do express the emotions in the scenes, but it's pretty overstated. Did they record this whole thing in a sauna, or something? Enough with the heavy breathing! If you just want to listen to it for your own purposes, it's great, but in a classroom, expect your students to feel awkward and make jokes about how some parts sound like a bad porno."
2,I Respect Miller's Motives Most of All,"I understand that ""The Crucible"" serves as an allegorical attack on McCarthyism and Black Listing and I praise Arthur Miller for his wonderful use of allegory in the Salem Witch Trials. I personally, had a hard time reading this piece of drama. It was forced reading for English class and I may have found it more interesting if we, as a class, read it aloud with different students reading different parts, etc. However, my English teacher felt it best to assign an act a night leaving me confused and tired. I didn't find the story that interesting."
1,no thanks,I never received this product. I was told it was mine and that it was shipped. Then I was told it was not mine and then it never came. I had to purchase the book somewhere else. So I am probably not going to order anything from amazon again. Time will tell
5,ONE OF THE BEST PLAYS OUT THERE!!!!!!,"The Crucible is one of the most powerful plays I've ever read . I'm only 14, but that still says a lot. Right from the beginning , I was addicted and couldn't get away from it. Arthur Miller is incredible.READ THIS & you will thank me!!!"
4,"It was kind of confusing at first, but then it was real good","This play I read was confusing at first but it was real good in the second act. I read this play in class in Petersburg, Va, at Petersburg High School. When we read it in class and my teacher explained it, then I knew what it meant, but when we had to read it at home, it was very confusing. But overall, it was very good!"
2,School...,I was forced to read this for school. So I did not enjoy it as much but it was a well written play and if you like to read Puritan English this is a good one to read.
2,shipping time is somewhat long,shipping time is longer than other book seller. i received the books after 3 weeks i ordered. Typically i receive books from other seller in a week.
3,School,I did'n receive that product The Crucible in my address about in the date 7/4/09. I hope so you delivered that book .
2,The Crucible,"The printing is of poor quality, some pages are genuinely difficult to read. Since I was unable to view pages on the website I was unaware of the print quality. I would choose a different edition, if I had it to do again."
4,it's great.,"I have finished reading the Crucible - it is simply great. The text is wonderful, full of ironies and dramatic scenes - for example, the scene where Elizabeth lies for the first time in her life to save Proctor's reputation, only to realise that her good intentions have unwittingly helped Abigail. Land wars, revenge and a host of other reasons show us the repressed state Salem was in in those days. The relationships between the main characters : Proctor, Parris, Abigail, etc, were understandable and one could actually feel himself or herself praying that a particular character would survive the madness, or feel sympathy for even the villains. The Crucible was a great experience for me, and I hope that via this review many of you out there will go and buy this book to see what I mean."
5,Thought provoking,"Arthur Miller's The Crucible provides a great parallelism between the witch haunt from the seventeenth century and the contemporary political issues. Apart from this, the book is a captivating story that is well worth the time reading."
2,Hard to follow,"I bought this to use with my basic 11th English class. It goes too fast, skips and rearranges lines, and is too hard to follow. At the end of one reading, several students left the class saying that they had no idea what the play was about so far."
2,NOT the unabridged version,"While this version is a fine audio production, it is labeled incorrectly as the unabridged version. There are several parts that are edited out. I purchased this one as a supplement to the unabridged version in my classroom. However, it simply is no the unabridged version. If you do want this version, you could download this version from itunes in a matter of minutes rather than waiting for it to ship."
4,The Crucible-a moving story,"I have recently read 'The Crucible' by Arthur Miller. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it to everyone. This was a moving and rather depressing story of the Salem witch trials but I loved it. Abigail is a young girl who, with other girls in the town, claims to be tortured by spectors (spirits) in the village of Salem, but really just makes these accusations up. But these aren't just friendly accusattions. If you are accused of being a witch you can confess and ""come back to God"" and be fogiven, or you can deny the accusation all together and be hanged.This is an intense story of love, courage, and tragedy and how the peculiar town of Salem reacts to all of these.If you can handle this great tear-jerker, then I highly recommend it."
5,very interesting,"If you were accused of being a witch back in the 17 century in Massachusetts then you were one. Very good film about pointing fingers, lying, religion, and cheating. I am actually quite happy I was forced to read this book."
2,my crucible reveiw,I thought this book was an interesting peice. It showed the emence superstition that the people in salem had during these times. I thiught it was good except fot the fact that the judges believed the girls over the rest of the people accused.over all it was a good read
4,The Crucible,This book is typically easy to read however the first act is a little har to get though because of the format. the author will stop every once in a while to talk about the history of the town or the charcters backround. Once you get to the second act the book begins to pick up and get a lot better. i am in high school and had to read this for a summer reading assignment. Once u get to the second act the author is past the exposition of the plot and it is easier to understand what is going on.
3,Learning About the Past,"Showing affliction in almost every character, this play shows you the consequences that many people faced for their beliefs. The Crucible was a very well written play. Arthur Miller chose an excellent topic to write about. Learning about the Salem witch trials and the ways of that time period was interesting and very informative. While getting boring at times with the same scene, I enjoyed reading it."
3,"Not my favorite, but a classic.","I had to read this in high school and again recently in grad school. I am not convinced the actual writing is great, but the story and the characters are fully developed and crucial. The story is a very important one to grasp and fully understand. Depicts how real life ""witch hunts"" began and are able to reach dangerous heights when laced with irrational people, ignorance, and narrow minded outdated beliefs. Scary part is, this is still happening on smaller scales all over the world. Again, not my favorite piece of literature because I enjoy old gothic romance (Wuthering Heights etc.) but I would highly recommend as a piece of writing any reader should take in at least once. Also, it's a piece of cake to read and takes no time."
2,Struggling,So far hasn't been able to keep my attention. Bought it because our high school is doing a play about this book and wanted to get scoop on story. Hope the play keeps my attention better than the book has.
4,It is great!,"I have been buying used books from Amazon.com for almost a year now. I really love the low prices and how accurate their description of product is. It helps a lot when picking out a book. I prefer buying books here now than in the local store especially if it is for school. Though the shipping took a bit longer than expected, everything else is good."
3,Assumption is the mother of all screw ups,"Have you ever been accused of something you didn't do? Have you ever been penalized for it? The book the crucible is a book about a disturbed young lady trying to have a little fun with her gullible town. She claims that the townspeople are doing witchcraft and making their spirits rise out of their bodies to cause her and her friends grief. Abigail, the leader, has one goal, she has her eye on one of the towns married men, and she causes all sorts of harm trying to gain him as her own. If you were accused, this wont necessarily make you feel better, it'll just make you glad you weren't alive in this era of time."
4,Great example of the Massachusetts witch trials,Shows the retalliation of a group of children whose parents place consticting restraints on them.You see what happens when power goes to the head of people not mature enough to handle it.
3,3rd in Line,This is my fifth on my list of favorite books. I was shopping and bought a copy. When I opened it I instantly felt like I was back in highschool again.
5,In Case of Bears,"The poems in this volume are a delight for all ages. Grizzly to Teddy, to poems ""bearing"" the soul- this book journeys through a rich landscape of language. In Case of Bears is a treasure!"
5,cool,this is so cool im getting it today with my grandma i have 20 dollars and this is only 14 so im gonna get this for my bratz i have punkz dylan pretty and punk yasmin sportz sasha and flash back fever yasmin and for hollywood cloe theyll love it
1,Good food bad equietment,My Wild life sarfi Yasmin and Cade is dating. Cade took her to the sushi louge an she said it wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better than the party spot
1,Sporadic performance,"There seem like many reasons to like this CD player, which can play .mp3 data discs as well as conventional CDs. Additionally, both the user interface and the appearance are quite nice. My major complaint is that the unit I was shipped often exhibits playback punctuated with short periods of silence or refuses to play discs at all. This behavior seems independent of whether the disc is .mp3 or conventional."
5,Great value,Very well designed CD changer that works. It's design also makes it easier to use. The best I've had.
4,Sounds great,"I purchaesd this cd player about a year ago and i really enjoy it. The sound of my cd's played on this unit sound fantastic. I hear so much detail and clarity coming form my cd's and they all sound so smooth. It's a pleasure to sit back and play my cd's on this component. It also looks very nice with the soft blue light right above the tray. It has a nice high quality look to it. I must admit though, this is my second unit as the first one i ordered from an unknown co. did not last very long. After only a few months, it began to take control of itself rejecting all commands from the remote or direct input; it just went crazy! But this second unit has worked beautifully."
3,Some minor performance problems,Occasionally shuts down for no reason. The more I use it the less frequently this seems to occur. Too lazy to send it back.
1,so sorry I bought this !,"I supposedly upgraded my system 4 months ago ~ I enjoy having a disc changer so I can shuffle my music ~ I had an old 5-disc Panasonic which worked for years like a faithful friend ~ I was so excited to get a 6-disc changer and gave away my old one ~ but, now, I fight with this Onkyo to get it to play random continously ~ sometimes it will, sometimes it will not ~ I clear it over & over, clean the CD's, however, this player seems to have a mind of it's own ~ PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS if you like to shuffle your music & who doesn't !"
1,disc player,"random play sometimes plays all discs, sometimes does not. I always clean my discs, but sometimes they skip on this player. I've owned a Pioneer cd player for 25 years and never have had a problem with it.. Not very pleased with the unit that I just purchased. Thanks"
1,Random doesn't work,"Beware of this product. Mine didn't work correctly out of the box; random wouldn't work at all and even sequential play would not always find tracks. After conversing with the manufacturer it was determined the unit was defective and to send it back at my cost, which was $50. I would not purchase this unit again. Too bad as the sound of the unit was very good, much better than I expected."
1,I should have listened to the reviews,"Bought this unit brand new in early January. Worked fine, no problems. Now not even 3 months later it appears to be dead. Frozen up. Can not open the tray which I have 6 cd's in.I just cant believe a brand new cd player would last less than 3 months.UNBELIEVABLE."
2,Okay for a year.,"The unit worked fine for a little over a year. Then it started showing ""no disk"" even though a disk was inserted.I took it to the local Onkyo repair shop. It would have cost $161 to repair it, when I only paid $147.99 in the first place."
1,Don't Buy Refurbished,"I bought the refurb version of this player, and am sorry that I did. The tray on the first one wouldn't close all the way. The second one (yea, silly me...)wouldn't play, and the turntable wouldn't turn. Both times, this was right out of the box. I'm out $30 for having to ship these back. I guess that I'll have to repair my 15 year old Sony."
2,there's better players out there...!,"My Onkyo only lasted about 18 months before dying(i.e not playing cds correctly). 18 months! sheesh!The one best feature is that it plays mp3s.It's drawbacks:1. It takes about 20 seconds to power up before you can insert a cd.2. The rewind/ fastforward ONLY works by using the REMOTE ,and not on the machine itself, and works poorly.When this thing finally started dying, it would play 10 seconds of a cd, then skip to the next, play 10 seconds of THAT cd, move on,,etcI was happier with my old Sony."
2,Not impressed at all,"I'm not impressed with Onkyo, this is my second multi CD player from them and both have proved to be very frustrating. If I load up the carousel I can guarantee that at least one of the CD's will not be recognized and the player will skip to the next CD. There is no rhyme or reason to this. I can take out the offending CD and replace it without doing anything to it and it will play OK. I will be moving on to possibly a Marantz CC-4001 very soon."
1,Only one year,"Everything was going fine until we hit the one year mark. Now, it doesn't work at all. I turn to the Onkyo support site to learn that all but two of their products carry and two-year parts and service warranty - and this is one of those two. Why? I guess my story is the reason.One year ain't long for this kind of money..."
1,Good Sound If Working,"I purchased this unit 2 years ago. You would expect a product from Onkyo to be reliable for a long time. I had to repeatedly take the unit in for repair during the warranty period. It lasted one year after the warranty ended with very little use. From this point on, I will only purchase receivers made by Onkyo."
1,Do NOT BUY ONKYO DXC390,"I would not purchase the Onkyo model DXC390 disc changer. I received mine last night and hooked it right up and it wont read not one cd. A complete waste of time, energy and money. I have had Onkyo products since 1980 and never have had a problem. Well, they wont get a second chance with me. I cant even give it one star because it doesnt work period."
1,Stopped working after 1 year,Bought this based on friends referrals and written reviews and it quit working after 1 year. Very disappointed.
1,Can't recommend this CD player.,"The unit failed after around 9 months of light use. It basically froze up and wouldn't play, eject or respond to any commands. Sent it back for repair under warranty and didn't receive it back for 3 months. Worked ok for maybe 10 hours of use, now failed again. Won't even power on. I give up and will order a Marantz CC4001."
2,Noisy and Starts on Its Own,"I purchased this item in May of 2006 and found it to be a good CD player. However, in the third year of its life, the DX-C390 began to turn itself on its own. I would turn off the CD changer only to find, minutes later, that it would again turn itself on without human intervention.When I returned from a week vacation, I found the CD changer in the play mode. It played constantly 24/7 for the entire week and the player was hot to the touch. I feel this is a definite fire safety hazard and will report this to the Consumer Product Safety Commission."
2,Solid single disc player but poor functioning disc changer,"While I like Onkyo and I think the products are made to last, I'm baffled by how poorly the DX_C390 6-disc CD changer operates. It is incredibly slow as it cycles from song to song (it feels like it take about 30 seconds per track), and it's especially frustrating when the changer sticks on a track that doesn't exist: it's common that the changer stalls out on what will read ""track 99"" on the display (when obviously such a track does not exist). As one other reviewer noted, this isn't due to the poor condition of the disc or a burned copy -- it does this with new, store bought discs.I'd recommend going with a different brand and model if you're looking for a hassle-free disc changer for at home listening."
2,Very Badly Designed,"I was very annoyed to discover that there is no memory button on the front.To program the play list you have to use the remote-very fiddley.Don't loose the remote!Going through a cdrom and programing is clunky , hit and miss.Never let an engineer design the user interface--as usual.Why by a 6 cd changer thats a pain the in A to program.No memory for the programed input either , so dont turn off the machine.The housing is very deep-a couple of feet.Since its 6cd it cant be helped.2 stars for such an egregious error in the programing interface."
2,did not last,"We bought this in March 2008 -- it only lasted until mid-2010, about two years, with very light usage. I would not recommend this player."
1,Bad Product,"I bought the DX-390 about 1.5 years ago. My use has been minimal. Recently, it started to turn itself on and the changer will not eject. You have to disconnect the power source to get the unit to shut off. I was going to try to get it serviced, then I read the reviews - many people are experiencing the same issue. I think that I would be letting myself in for a load of pain with no positive resolution. Anyone have suggestion on a good 5 or 6 cd unit ???"
2,Player Limitations,"I like the display ( Artist, Album, Song title, Folder Title) It plays the cd's that it will play fine, however I found the following limitations: 1. It will not play cd's burned with a lightscribe burner all the way through. 2. There are some mp3 downloads (from amazon) that it will not play) I asked amazon agents to at least advise their customers of this, but no luck. 3. it doesn't seem to recognize sub-folders. If you knew these limitations it would not be so frustrating."
1,"Junk, Less than 2 yrs. old and died.","Jan, 3 2008 Purchased from Amazon........DEC. 5, 2009. The stand by light stays on but theres nobody home. Does not do anything. Guess it's target practice now......"
1,didnt even work,got this cd player and hooked it up and the thing could not read any disc very disappionted with it.!!!! sent it back for a refund.
1,"Had two units, neither worked","Had gone through two units, both powering up, and skipping over disks, showing no CD's. Tried different CD's, same problem."
5,Love this cd player,More than what I expected excellent choice excellent quality and service will recomend to any one to buy this CD Player system.
3,cd replacement,"I purchased the unit as a replacement for a Yamaha unit that I had purchased years ago . The unit had begun to skip. The Onkyo CD changer is an exact clone, with the exception of the remote, only it cost 1/2 as much. So far it has performed flawlessly. Its tough being a Troglodyte."
4,Onkyo DX-C390,"I was looking for a stand alone CD player for my home entertainment center with a reputation of quality, quality sound, reliability and affordable. Looks like I found one according to reviews and listening to this great little product. Seems robust and sounds great! I like having a 6 CD selection when entertaining guests, cleaning house to what ever and don't to have to keep listening to same CD over and over again. This needs to be looked into further if your in the market for a stand alone CD player. Glad I did!"
2,Performance problems,"Our complaint is that it started having serious problems about 6 months after we got it. It will suddenly stop playing, or, will pause for 2 or 3 seconds then continue. We like the 'random' feature, but that has completely stopped working."
1,Onkyo DX-C390 CD Changer - Poor Quality Unit,"After purchasing this changer I will never buy another Onkyo component again. Approximately 20% of my CD's will not play in the random (shuffling)mode, those that do play will frequently stop playing, the display timer does not work, and Onkyo's customer service is non existent.When I contacted Onkyo about the problems the only recourse I was offered was to return it to the point of purchase for an exchange. I did not consider this a fair solution since J&R; is 3,000 miles and 2-3 weeks away via UPS. There is an authorized Onkyo repair shop a couple of blocks away from me, but Onkyo refused to assist me by dealing through them. I have decided to just cut my losses, just go buy another brand of CD changer.and tell anyone who asks what I think of Onkyo products."
4,"Good value, but at least 1 annoying feature","I'm happy with the sound and quality of this unit, but it has one ""feature"" that I feel is a bug. If I load discs in bays 1 - 6 and then start playing on disc 3, after reaching disc 6 the unit stops -- it won't play discs 1 and 2. Onkyo says this is normal -- the unit only plays forward and won't ""wrap"" back to disc 1. The workaround is to put the unit in Repeat mode, but that makes it play all discs endlessly. I've owned CD changers from several other manufacturers and none behaved this way.If you own one of these machines, please call Onkyo and complain -- they said if enough people complain they will issue a firmware update.One other issue: my wife thinks this machine is louder when switching discs than our old Sony changer. This is most apparent in Shuffle mode. I don't think the difference is significant, though."
5,Unexpected value and performance,"A lot better than expected in quality, function, and enjoyable features. Big sound, convenience, and ease of operation are hallmarks of this suprising value."
1,Looks are deceiving,"It looks good on the surface but looks are deceiving. This wasn't very heavily used in our household but the first part we had to replace six months after purchase was the imaging module. That took the player out for more than a month while we waited for a part and then the repair person could not exactly match the original manufacturer's part. Now it's stopping in the middle of songs, turning off and on by itself and has once reported some kind of error code on the front pannel though after a short wait started working again.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk IMHO. Your experience may varry."
2,Onkyo DXC390 6 Disc CD Player--Doesn't Work as Promised,"My first Onkyo 6 Disc CD Changer died in March of 2011. It had played music without interruption for 19 years. What a great piece of equipment! Since then, I have ordered two new CD changers in the past month (March 2011)and neither one of them compares to the first. There are a number of issues with the new version. They do a poor job of playing CDs that are copies of original CDs. They stop in mid song and quit playing. Then mysteriously moves to the last song on the CD. We have no clue what makes the machine do this. It must be possessed! Finally, on some CDs, when the last song has played, the changer will not switch to the next CD. We are totally bummed out by this. The overall machine doesn't have the same quality as the old model and appears to be of cheaper materials."
4,solid multi-disc player,"Although love my mp3 players and music, roots go back to vinyl and then of course cd.(i.e., listening to music through quality headphones or in front of my large JBL's) My trusty old pioneer muti-disc finally died. Researched a replacement, and selected the Onkyo due to the positive reviews, and the 6 (over typical 5) disc capability. Have always respected the Onkyo name (although never owned a product), and appears unlike many other 70's or so brands, remains a 'Hi-Fi' company.Performance of player has been flawless, and build quality high (blue light over disc tray cool too! (and can be turned off if desired). As many others have said, it is BIG!. However not an issue in my case, and slid into my little component tower (barely!).Highly recommend if looking for a quality multi-disc player!"
1,Same problems as everyone else,Stay Away from this one. This is my first review on Amazon and I just wanted to let people know that my unit froze up at the first year mark as other people have posted. Obviously there is a design flaw and I would stay away from this machine. It stopped working and will not open. I am not even going to try to get it fixed or repaired. Very disappointed in Onkyo.
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","After having this CD player for about 11 months, it started switching itself on at random times. I changed the surge protector/power bar it was connected to and made sure none of my remote control devices was creating the problem. Once the surge protector was changed the program disappeared for about a week or two, only to resurface. Now the device won't even switch on. No other device connected to the surge protector (ADM tuner, Yamaha cassette player, Acurus amp, Teac turntable, Terk antenna) has developed any problems over the same period. A Lemon."
1,Very poor quality,"This CD player initially seemed perfect for us. We liked the ability to load multiple CDs, and loved the sound quality. After several weeks however, it would power on randomly with a flashing blue light. We would turn it off, but a few minutes later it would come on again. Some CDs wouldn't play at all. Often it would start playing in the middle of a CD that was no longer in the player. Unfortunately, although it was a good idea, we would never buy this one again. It had so many issues it wasn't worth trying to repair so it was put out with our E-waste less than a year after we bought it."
1,This is the worst CD player I've ever had,"I love Onkyo products.... They work and sound great and do everything that you could ask for.... Except this one. After a little over a year, I was noticing that the CD player would turn itself on. Soemtimes it would start playing the CD, others it would start and pause it. There were even times where I couldn't control anything. I did some online research and it seems that there are a good amount of consumers having issues with this CD player. It was great before the issues started, but for $200 I shouldn't have issues."
1,This product does not work in random shuffle!,"The random shuffle feature does not work. It stops to play CDs randomly and you have to manually restart to carry on playing. If you want to use the random play - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The help from the support center is so bad that you might as well toss this in the garbage. In any case, how much trouble do you want to go through with on a product that costs $130? So save yourself all the hassle and buy something that works."
3,I own it,Onkyo DXC390 6 Disc CD PlayerI just purchased this one. I needed a second CD player but did not have a lot of $ to do so. I installed this unit and it worked without pause.It is a little noisy on tray opening and disc change but for the price its forgivable.
3,Excellent sound,Excellent quality on sound reproduction. Price is in range with unit. The disc try is a little confusing and not easy to load. Too early to give it a better score.
2,No service in Brazil and product does not work,"Product does not work (CDs are not read) and I do not see any service listed in Brazil for Onkyo. It was sold as new, not as refurbished, but it had a bump on the side. What action can I take?Onkyo DXC390 6 Disc CD Player"
4,Good Choice,"Bought this product based on other reviews and to replace an older Onkyo CD player that was 20 years old. As stated in other reviews, the only negative that I have experienced is the time delay between songs on the random play mode. Other than that it is a perfect replacement for my old player. I would highly recommend this unit."
1,Don't by this Player,I bought this new less than a year ago. It had problems reading certain CD's right off the bat. It always had issues with the 6-disk random shuffle. It would often skip two or three of the disks completely when fully loaded in the random shuffle mode. It now will not read or play any CD. Spend a $100 more and buy a better player. This did not even last 1-year.
2,Surprisingly big but has some good features,"First, I was surpriesed of how big the player is.But it still can fit on my TV stand. The height is a bit to long though.I hooked up with Onkyo TX805 and it sounds amazing. Also it has good features as blue light on when the Cd is playing, random play, track selection and so on.I bought this because my Philips DVD (Upscaling and Region free) has a major fault playing CDs which is it makes a small noise when playing CDS.But this Onkyo CD changer can contains 6 CDs and sounds great so I am happy to have this.After using it for a couple of months, it begins to avoid playing a lot of CDs.Lense problem starts."
1,Great while/if it lasts,"I bought this [new] from Amazon not quite 1 year ago and now it's dead. The sound quality seemed great (but then again I do have a 70's Marantz receiver and big JBL speakers), but now the on/off gets stuck on standby, then the tray won't open, and when I can finally try to play a CD, it starts skipping then stops playing. I even bought a CD-brush cleaner but the problem wasn't as simple as a little dust.Why are stereo components nowadays made so crappy that you have to keep replacing them? Is everything made in China? Too bad they didn't make CD players back in the 70s when stereo electronics were made in the USA and Japan with QUALITY. I certainly can't recommend something that falls apart in less than a year."
2,good sound but poor carousel,Cds do not stay in position. Drawer often opens with cds scattered about.In random the cds randomly stop playing. I expected more from onkyo.
1,DO read reviews for this item!~!!!!,"The sound on this when i hooked it up was great. I have an Onkyo reciever so I ignored the large amount of bad reviews. I am an onkyo fan and do remain one. THis is not the CD player you are looking for. AS I said it worked, looked and sounded great; for a day. Then the tray stopped opening and closing correctly. Specifically, it stopped closing and playing CD's. Back to amazon immediatey...which by the way, with UPS pick up, is five stars for amazon!! Great return service. I am going to try the Yamaha, i know they make a good product!! And for the record; For those of you that think single function CD players are obsolete due to DVD players; think again!! I will get back to you on the Yamaha. I have a feeling I will be very happy!!"
5,Great Product,"Like a few other buyers I've seen, I had problems with a Sony CD changer that I bought. Surprsing to me, because I generally really like Sony products. So I bit the bullet, gave the Sony to a thrift shop, went online and checked other reviews, and decided on this Onkyo CD changer. I could not be more satisfied. Simple enough, inexpensive enough, but works like a charm. I would highly recommend it."
5,works great,I have one and it works great have had no problems would recommend it to anyone looking for a easy to use cd changer
1,"poor excuse for a cd player ,i hate it","i took this out of the box after a room was remodeled,unfortunately, this was beyond the 30 day return window,,i am attempting to play new and nearly new cd's, all commercially made,,the player will pick up 2 out of six discs, i have tried this with different cd's , same results,,forget about shuffling,,,after the first disk is loaded,it plays one track, then it goes into an infinite shuffle mode, never finds another disk,i am not going to get stuck on a phone for hours trying to reach some customer service rep like other discouraged buyers, this will go back to amazon,and even if i get a $10 partial refund i will be happier than having this piece of junk taking up space. this should go to the local dump"
1,Had player for 3 years and died,I bought this player based on the reviews found on Amazon. It worked well for about 3 years and then just stopped playing CDs. Nothing happened to the unit and has been in the same spot for 3 years. It just up and died.
3,3 Stars,"BTNHResurrection is full of feel good tracks, it's one of my favorite Bone Thugs albums, but overall it's AVERAGE."
2,This Aint Tha Thuggish bone thugs i know,Im a big fan of bone thugs there the best besides tupac & eazy but this is not good a t all.Its To Peacful where the hard beats and thugged out lyrics.If u wana hear good bone thugs hear these songs1.No surrender2.Thuggish ruggish bone3.For the love of money4.1st of da month5.look into my eyesIf you like the thugged out bone thugs dont get this but i still have it in respect for Bone thugs
2,VERY AVERAGE FORMULA,Once Upon a TIme Bone THugs-N- Harmony had something fresh going on.but after a while Like Everything else in The Biz their Style was Ripped by COuntless others&they themselves are Playing the Formula Game here.I Guess After Working With MAriah Has Mellowed them down? The Music Is Pretty Flat&Formula Felt.While I still Respect their Flow it seems more Business than any New Ideas Going into this.
2,SELLOUTS!,"Please dont waste your cash on this go buy Creepin on a comeup I dont know what happened to these cats, but i guess they decided they wanted more play on MTV or sumthin. Oh yeah if you get a chance you can see them in concert w/christina aguillera and destinys child! now you tell me if thats selling out!"
2,GOOD CD,"I wrote a review before, and i take back what i said about this cd, Resurection is a great album , after i started listening to it i changed my mind, all the songs are off the hook, and the lyrical flow of all the member, krazy, lazy, bizzy, wish and flesh are the bomb. 2 glocks is the best song off the album, and change the world is awsome to. I have the Bone thugs n harmony Vo.2 DVD, and it shows them in the studuio makeing this album, and it looks like they worked really hard on it, it wasent there come back or anything but it was a really well done cd, so bone thugs n harmony....KEEP IT UNDERGROUND, AND THUGUSH RUGISH"
1,Bone Thugs Fell Off,"I just want to help somebody out thats about to get this cd. Straight up, dont get this its weak. Most of the lyrics...[poor] the same goes for the beats. Bone needs to spend some more time on their future songs, so they can come out with another East 1999 cd, and make some green. Bone's first two cds were their best."
5,Bone is back.,Bone Thugs N Harmony have returned with anouther great CD. This maybe their last together considering rumors that Bizzy left the group last week for good.
4,Good album only 1 break out track to me though.,Bone Thugs-N-Harmony is my fav rap group so mainly if they make a album i'll check it out. But the only song on the album that is amazing(Bone has a rep for having a few of these on each album) is change the world which can be another tha crossroads.
4,Good CD but not their best,"A lot of groups have been changing along with the times it seems. And thats kind of what Bone has been doing as well. its kind of unfortunate because their classic style as seen in E1999 is now slightly different.But its not all bad, as I still enjoyed this album. Ecstacy is still one of their better songs. But I feel as if this album had a ""filler"" songs which is a little disappointing. But all in all, it is still a nice CD, and any fan of Bone should definitely pick it up."
5,holdin it down!,"Bone is still holdin' it down. This CD has shown that they are still gangsta'd out but they know that it's more going on than the everday stuff. They are definitely holdin' it. If you want to hear music about what's real, listen to this. If you want to see that gangsta'd out shorties still got something to hope for, check it out. I am especially feeling CHANGE THE WORLD featuring BIG B. The lyrics are tight the arrangement is tight everything is just on point. I want to know more about this artist and see him out there doing his own thing. CHECK OUT BIG B---CHANGE THE WORLD. This CD is definitely one that I'm glad I bought.STAY MYSTERIOUS BONE!"
5,Listen to my battlecry,"THIS CD IS BONE'S BEST YET. YES, IT'S BETTER THAN E1999 ETERNAL. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE TIGHT AND BONE SEEMS TO HAVE SPED UP THEIR RAPPING EVEN MORE. GLOCKS, THE RIGHTEOUS ONES, BATTLEZONE, WEED SONG, AND PAPER, PAPER RANK AMONG BONE'S BEST SONGS TO DATE. THE ONLY BONE CD THAT IS EVEN CLOSE TO THIS ONE IS KRAYZIE BONE'S THUG MENTALITY 1999. DEFINATELY CHECK THIS ONE OUT."
5,Best CD I've Ever Heard!,I bought this CD and I play it (believe it or not) about 4 times a day! I've had it for about a month and it is still the one I love! I just cannot get sick of this! BUY THIS!
4,Sure to be overlooked - Bone Thugs rise again,"Bone Thugs-n-Harmony are back with a new album that is sure to be overlooked by the mainstream. These days, if you're not white and think you're black, or you're not DMX or Jay-Z, you can pretty much forget about exposure. Bone has put together a top-notch album for 2000, and I've listened to it and it only since I got it a few days ago. I can't put it down, its that good. Its lacking in a few areas and a few songs (namely Weed Song) had me wishing they had put more thought into it, but songs like Resurrection, Ecstacy, No Way Out, One Night Stand, etc. are perfect. This cd left me MUCH more satifsfied than Art of War after the first listen, and it grows on you fast. Forget all that sound-alike $h!t out there on the radio and especially Mtv, and pick this up. After listening to it a few times you'll have a hard time turning it off."
5,Bone does it again,This CD is a classic if you liked E.1999 then you'll love this one cus everysong is tight. The beats are awesome and they flow to every song. This is a must buy!
2,Bone,"I used to be Bone's biggest fan, but I stopped liking them after they made ""Art of War""(an ok album). Ok, how many times can you rap about Cleveland and St.Clair? We know thery're from Cleveland, they don't need to keep saying the same thing over and over and over again. My advice to Bone is, to start rapping about different topics, I'm tired of hearing about cops, Cleveland and St. Clair. And for pete sake, slow down the rapping, I can't even understand what thery're saying . The reason why I gave this two stars is because, I did like the songs ""Ecstasy"" & ""Resurrection (Paper, Paper)"" If you like Bone then buy this album, but in opinion, ""E.1999 Eternal"" was the best album they ever did. Peace Out..."
2,Not The Same Bone,"What happened to Bone Thugs N' Harmony? These talented, gritty, street rappers from Cleveland have turned into soft pretty boys. I respect this album, espcially tracks 2 and 5 (The Righteous Ones and Ectacsy respectively), but I find myself searching hard for other top songs. Especially after song 10, this album becomes down right soft. I would only suggest this to diehard fans, but then again, you would already have this album."
5,Next best bone after East 1999,"okay...not many cds can beat the bone classic E. 1999. but this one comes pretty close. almost every song here is excellent the only two songs i dont like on this cd are ""Weed song"" (unfortunately) and ""Can't Give It Up"" the first 6 songs are amazing with tight lyrics and awesome beats...then comes ""resurrection"" and ""change the world"" all these songs are extremely good...if you want to download some mp3's to try out what the cd is like, i recommend getting ""2 glocks"", ""resurrection"", ""change the world"", and ""the righteous ones"". if you are a true bone fan this cd will not let you down..."
4,CLOSE ENOUGH,"Yo,wassup I recently listened to tha new Bone album,and I was cool wit it.First off let me say,comparing any bone album to ""E.1999 eternal"",is like comparing any Nas album to ""ILLMATIC"" ,just hope you get something close to it.I mean tha album aint bad by any means,but it aint a classic either.I mean some songs they could have left off aka ""Weed Song"" ,but its all good.bottom line its a must have 4 any Bone fans,and I speak on tha behalf of all Bone fans.when I say,Bone we hope this time you don't make us wait 3 years 4 tha next one."
5,ETERNAL BONE,"Bone Thugs n Harmony come tight. Bizzy ripz the tracks blazin. This album is the caliber of East 1999. Always good rollin to, ya feel. Buy it, get deep and listen to tracks 5 and 11. Peace"
3,MORE MELLOWED OUT!,"THIS ALBUM IS MORE MELLOW.THE BEST ALBUM B.O.N.E. EVER RELEASED TO ME IS ""CREEPIN ON AH COME UP"" I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE GET OLDER AND WISER AND NOT ON THAT GANGSTA LEVEL BUT B.O.N.E. WAS THE CREATORS OF GANGSTA RAP AND NOW THEY AIN'T EVEN IN THE GANGSTA RAP CATAGORY ANT MORE.HERE'S THE GOOD TRACKS 2,3,6,7,9,10,12,13.8-16. $MIGHTY$"
3,BTNHResurrection,"I liked this album, but it was in no comparison to E.1999Eternal or Creepin. The songs were tight my favorite being #14. Thesong brings up alot of memories of their old Stuff. Made me think of my high school days rollin w' my friends in my cadillac. My opinion if you are a bone fan buy it."
3,A Great Hip Hop Effort,"I really give this CD a 3.5, but Amazon won't let you do half stars.As far as Bone Thugs discography, this one my not stand up as their best effort, but after listening, you'll agree it's definitely a great CD.""Cant give it up"" has been one of my favorite songs by BTNH since the release of this album. Some other notbales are:""Ecstacy""""Resurrection (Paper, Paper)""""One Night Stand [Bonus Track]""""Servin' Tha Fiends"" Sounds more like earlier cuts"
4,Kings of rap,"The resurrection album is impressive, If you are a flesh n bone fan you will like this one, flesh features on most if not all of these songs. Ecstasy, Change the world, don't worry and One night stand (Bizzy Bone) are ones to listen too. If you dont have this one get it quik!"
2,REserection,"First and Formost, I woul like to say that the only songs that I thought were off the heezy were Ecstacy & Resserection(Paper,Paper)After buying their fist, Creepin On A Come Up, I said to myself, this is tight as hell. Although their best ws East.1999, this is stlill worth a shot"
4,mediocre album from btnh..[ 3.5 to be exact ],"considering the quality of the previous albums, e.99 and the blazin' Art of War..this album is a let down. but then again, diversity is what they produced in btnhresurrection. this album is very different among the previous...the best beats are lacking. though it has some good points on the songs Battlezone, Change The World, Can't Give It Up, and Weed song. this album i should say is an average btnh album....but the songs i mentioned above is worth giving a listen. they are all tight!"
5,BONE THUGS N HARMONY BEST RAPERS OF THE WORLD,"BONE THUGS N HARMONY ALWAYS IS GONNA BE THE BEST RAPERS,AND YOU WILL KNOW IT WHEN YOU LISTEN AT THIS NEW ALBUM RESURRECTION,THERE NO COMPETITION FOR THEY,THEY ARE THE BEST .SORRY RAPERS GET ALL THE HELL OUT OF THE COMPETITION BECAUSE BONE THUGS CAME ONCE AGAIN AND UNITED FOR EVER! BUY IT INCLUDES THE VERY HIT SINGLE OF RESURRECTION (PAPER PAPER)! I HAVE ALL THEY RECORDS I HAVE TOO THE VERY RARE CD IS FACES OF DEATH ! BUT CHECK THIS CD OUT ! BUY IT FAST YOU CAN !"
2,THEY MIGHT NEVER LIVE UP TO E.1999 ETERNAL,"With this new album, I was expecting Bone to go back to the lyrics of E.1999 Eternal(A classic, one of the best rap albums). Unfortunately, like Art of War, the songs that are good can be counted with less than all my fingers. Each album after e.1999 has fallen short of it. This album is alright but too many slow songs, SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM BONE. Their gangsta style is what got everyone, and Easy-E, on their new redifining rap flows. After the Crossroads, their songs turned more pop for money. 2 Stars cause there is much better stuff out there right now like Chronic 2001, Alkaholiks, etc."
5,BONE THUGS N HARMONY,"Bone Thugs should be named the masters of rap. Their CD is the best and I would recommend it to people who are 12 and older.The song ""Change the World,"" is my favorite song because it's about changing the world into something better."
3,What Happened?,"Now I'm a hella big Bone fan but this album was very disappointing! I went & got this the day it came out just to find about 5 good songs on the entire album! It's worth listening to but it's NOWHERE NEAR their previous albums! But if you like Bone, buy this anyway. There are a few good songs like Ecstacy, Resurrection, Servin Tha Fiends, and Mind On Our Money. The rest is good but not great. Buy it if U like Bone!"
3,hmmmm.....,"this is the story of the whiteoak family and their voyage to quebec,canada(circa1850s)to start their new life and build the ""dream house"" that they want so much.the character development was so-so. i never found myself really caring about any ofthese people.the most interesting part of the book was during the journey to canadaand all the other people that adeline and philip whiteoak met on the ship. i read it through just to see what happened in the end. there is nothing racy or scary inthis book. i think other readers might enjoy this series,especially readers wholike very light reading and no emotional involvement. this is homespun,cheerfulentertainment."
1,Ewww... HANSON WANNA-BE's!!!,"These guys are SUCH Hanson wanna-be's, and they're doing a rather bad job of it. There's one difference- Hanson has a little thing called TALENT. If anyone disagrees about Hanson, feel free to email me, as I'm a huge fan. Taylor's such a cutie. Bye all! :o) PS- HANSON RULES!!!"
1,I hate this.,"I hope these weirdos never record again. I want to send these freaks to Mars. Yucky, yucky album."
1,What is this?,Are these people guys or girls? I'm serious. I don't know. This sounds like Reba McEntyre all messed up. I hate it. Who made this CD have an average of 5 stars? This is retarded.
1,NEVER AGAIN,"ALTHOUGH I WAS BILLED PROMPTLY FOR THE CD WHICH WAS TO BE A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER, I NEVER RECEIVED THE CD. WHEN CALLING TO CHECK ON THE SHIPMENT I WAS ADVISED IT HAD SHIPPED AND THEY WOULD NOT RE-SHIP THE ITEM AND TAKE A LOSS ON THE SALE AND IN ADDITION THE CD WAS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. DUE TO THE LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM I WOULD NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN. LESSON LEARNED!"
1,The worst creatures in the world.,"Yuck! How can they do that, so incredible and disgrace. I've never heard this kind of songs before. And they call it songs? And their looks, oh gosh, some black hair, some blond hair, what are they doing? Their look is soooooooooo disgusting. And make me want to vomit too. How can u guys have such bad taste? Really make me wonder, they must be God's mistake. PITY."
4,cute,"I became a Moffatts fan just a few weeks ago (yes, yes, I know) and I was intrigued to learn that they had a country album still available. I remember when they were out a couple years back here in the states . . . I wasn't that interested, but I am now! The album is cute and has some nice songs on it. I'm not that much of a country fan, but this album's a MUST for any Moffatts fan! It really takes you back and you can see just how far they've come. :)"
4,Quite Surprising,"I was looking through some music shops while on Holiday in Spain, when I stumbled along Chapter I: A new beginning. Looking at the front cover, I passed it by, but later in the holiday, I had the good fortune to see it on a listening post, so I tried, and inevitably buyed!. Having that CD, I also got the Moffatts debut album, which I also thought was brilliant. Being 20 years old, I feel a little silly listening to the Moffs, but I really do like them. This CD is definitely worth buying.It really is Quite Surprising."
5,Wow.....,"my friend came up to me and went ' You have to get the moffats cd Chapter one' and I was like who are the Moffatts?.. well Needless to say i went out and bought it, it blew me away totally. I loved it.. every song .. then i found out they've been around for a WHILE.. i was thinking 'Where was I when this was happening?' i think the only place i remember seeing that name was on the single ""Let the Music Heal Your Soul"" but their was SO manny artists on that song i didn't know who sang what.. (i loved that song too hehe) So here i am trying to get their Younger cd... i cant find it ANYWHERE i check here and its sold out =( Oh well i'm still goning to try! Bye bye from Jersey"
4,The Moffatts have proved their talent with this recent CD.,"The Moffatt brothers proved their talent to the world a long time ago. This recent US release, Chapter1: A New Begining, reinforces that and expands on it. They have added a few hidden tracks also, which in my opinion are even better than the rest of the already commendable tracks. The Moffatts are showing their true colors. Let it shine guys!"
5,Get over it already...,"Guys, listen. The Moffatts didn't copy Hanson, and Hanson didn't copy The Moffatts. Hanson is to the US as The Moffatts are to Canada, okay? Both bands have been around for a long time, and they both rock, period! I hope that stops some arguing over these silly matters..."
5,a great cd for the ultimate Moffatt fan !!,"Thsi is a great cd that the moffatts have done. althought I personally don't like country, this is a great cd for such young boys !! A great cd for any Moffatt fan to own !"
5,amazing sonics,"I am no Mahler expert and not even a big fan, but IMHO here Bertini strikes the perfect balance: he sounds always full of life and energy and yet he is never in a rush. Speaking of sound, I don't think I have ever heard a recorded orchestra sounding so true, so ""there"". Kudos to the WDR engineers for an outstanding job. As Classics Today's David Hurtz said: get this set before it disappears!"
5,My favorite childhood book,"I remember looking at this book for hours as a kid. The illustrations are so densely packed that wherever you look something interesting is going on. I love the underwater ship, so creepy. I came looking for a new copy but I see its going to be harder than I thought to get my hands on one.The thing is I still have my childhood copy, but unfortunatly it got a bit of water damage in storage. I pulled it out last night to show my 2 year old for his bedtime story and he would not let my close it! He wanted me to flip though it so many times!"
5,Great French Gore Romp,"THE LIVING DEAD GIRL is easily my favorite of the 7 Jean Rollin DVD's released thus far by IMAGE on DVD and it's the only one in my permanent collection. If you like your euro-horror a little sexier, a lot GORIER, and even quite humorous, you cannot go wrong here. From the opening scene with the graverobbers being disfigured by toxic vapors (hilariously fake) to later ultra-gory scenes as our tragic zombie-female-vamp dispatches one victim after another with her long sharp fingernails or devours their necks in extra-long munching scenes, this one DELIVERS the goods! It has a very euro-horror feel to it and is not as esoteric and heady as some of the other Rollin films. Although french, it easily would appeal to fans of italian horror as well...so if you're not a big Rollin fan, you may want to give this one a chance anyway. The DVD looks great and includes a trailer with ALL the highlights of the film in it (so watch the movie first). Check it out!"
4,so bad its good,"this is one of my favourite zombies movies of all time. its definitely a ""b-movie"" so dont expect anything more and you wont be disappointed"
2,tedious,"I was very disappointed with this movie.....i expected much more.It was painfully slow.....yes some good gore scenes....but too few and too much dead air inbetween!Unless you want to sit down and really watch a ""movie"" , as if its some drama...then this is notfor you......there are so many better horrors out there......Atmospheric yes......cute girls..yes......some sex ..yes....some blood..yesbut sadly in a rather boring drawn out package....You are better off going for ""Inside"" its a well paced gory French movie....hardly a dull momentfrom start to finish....and tons of blood!....That was a unique concept and worth every penny!Good luck..gore fans!!!"
4,You didn't tell me you were dead,"This is the first French horror movie I have seen and I must say ..wow. Director Jean Rollin really captures you with this film It begins with some guys going down a shaft to drop off some chemical waste (ilegally) when we see 2 coffins. Well these are mother and daughter, these guys then proceed to rob the corpses of their jewelry. All at once this poor shcmuk gets his eyes gouged out while the other one nearly **** his pants. Katherine (living dead girl) is supposed to have been dead 2 yrsshe looked quite beautiful to be dead that long. She then wanders around,thru this field where this busybody photographer starts snapping pix of her. (Wait till you see what happens to her!) Katherine's childhood friend Helene discovers her to be alive what happens next in the movie is bloodcurdling definitely a must see for all us horror fans topnotch enjoy! oh yeah The movie is French speaking but with English subtitles"
3,i love the movie but hate the english subtitles,"ok,i bought the movie thinking it would be english dubbed and it turned out to only be english subtitles.i like the movie but i hate reading subtitles .i even tried to sell it to a french guy at a yad sale and he wouldent take it.so if u hate movies that are not in english dont buy it."
3,Basie Big Band & Small-Group Studio Recordings,"A good sampling of the early 80's Basie Big Band in fine form on 5 tracks and a taste of the Basie small-group jazz ensemble on a couple of tracks. The smaller jazz ensemble affords the listener greater exposure to the Count on piano solos and his wonderful way of ""comping"" the other soloists. Good listening!"
5,"Raffi, Your Kids Will Love Him and So Will You!","As a retired teacher, my own children and many of my students are now grown, but we all still love Raffi. His Six Little Ducks and Going to the Zoo (both on the Singable Songs Collection) are favorites that still replay themselves in my mind often, even though it must be 20 years since I first heard them. This is not just kid music but good honest folk music. A very pleasant relief from today's overly techno children's pablum that is so common. These tunes would be great for any parent or primary teacher who wants to add music and singing to a part of the day. I have used them with the lyrics for a fun reading exercise. Give Raffi a listen. You gotta love him!"
5,Worth every penny!,I love listening to these songs and my 17-month-old son gives me a huge smile every time I play these songs. The songs are great for adults as well as kids. I love the kid friendly lyrics to Goodnight Irene. I know that we will be listening to these cds for years and that my son will be singing them to his children. A must have for every parent.
5,This is my favourite CD,"I am writing because I think this CD is really good. Even though I am only a month old, I really like it. I stop whatever I am doing to sit and listen. Later I'll be able to sing along. My mum's friend sent it as a gift, and she likes listening to it too. I really recommend it, and so does she."
3,raffi dvd,"very happy with these cds. glad we were able to find them on amazon and much more reasonable than in canada.. yours sincerely, satisfied buyer"
3,Cute but not the Wiggles!,I had been listening to the Wiggles first but had heard of Raffi and wanted to give it a try. I like the songs but compared to the Wiggles it isn't as much fun or as creative.
2,Ok CD,"As a father of two I try to find educational music with a good beat and i'll enjoy too. I couldn't find anything like that until I found Crazy Curt and the fireballs ""kidz go crazy"" My kids really did go crazy when they heard it!!! dont get me wrong, this CD is good but i would recomend going with Crazy Curt."
1,Incredibly dull,"There are so many better kid's artists. Raffi is so cheesy and boring. I don't know who is worse, Raffi or Barney."
1,Yawn.....,"I can't believe people still go for this artist. Even if his work was ""ground-breaking"" in the 70's, he can't hold a candle to Laurie Berkner (see her videos on Noggin Channel) I thought if this guy can still sell albums and they are this ho-hum, then anyone with recording equipment and a decent voice could do as well."
3,Not My Favorite But Still Very Inspiring,"This was still a very good story because it is involved with the famous classic Chronicles of Prydain, but the main reason why I did not like this as much as the other books mainly was like the reason for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In the story line, there was just too much traveling for one person to contain, as Taran looks around the entire realm to find out who he really is and who his parents were. This was altogether a good story, but not as much action to keep me in suspense. But I still recommend this if you can tolerate long traveling chapters."
3,Change of pace.,"Things slowed down a bit here from his last book. I would have liked to see more of the conflict with Morda...it just seemed to get resolved too easily. No Eilonwy, either, but I guess she would have hindered the story that Mr. Alexander was trying to tell here. It was more a story of growth for Taran. We'll see what happens in Book 5, The High King."
3,Beard Mafia's review,"We're about half way through the book. So far, the first half of the book my wife and I weren't as impressed as we were with the previous books in the series. However, the book is beginning to pick up a bit, and I'm sure we'll ultimately be happy we read it so that we can watch Taran grow."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Pig boy has status envy and the horn.So, not thinking he can do a princess he goes off instead, and has some magical animal stuff happen again, this time, in the form of a cow. The useful crow also happens along.A bit of training is also had by said pig boy in the art of magical weapon wielding. Magic potions, friend saving and wizard waxing are also to be found here."
2,Not the best,"Loydd Alexander is a wonderful writer, however this book is by far the worst in the series. The main charactor Tarran looks for his realatives to find if he is of noble birth. All in all this book was strange and had little plot developement and action."
5,"On time, good condition, great story",This is a replacement. I don't remember if it was used or new when it arrived. Lloyd Alexander books get snapped up and passed around in our house. It doesn't look new any more.
5,Great books,I read the Prydain Chronicles as a child and still find them enjoyable today. I look forward to one day sharing these tales with my children.
5,A great book,"This book contains a great lesson not only for Taran, but for us as well. The worth of a man doesn't hinge on his rank; both a good king and a good commoner have something to give to the world, and who's to say one is more important than the other. In this book Taran goes out in search of his past, hoping to find he is of noble birth in order to ask for the hand of the Lady Eilonwy. In the proccess he meets many new friends that teach him many lessons of life, and in the end, although he failed in his quest he gained more than he could ever realize. I recommend this book to all fantasy fans."
4,Classic fantasy fiction,"In Taran Wanderer, Taran sets out to find out exactly who he is. It has less action than the earlier three books (or the fifth book), but it's still fun to adventure through Prydain and let Taran develop into a man."
4,"""Rice Anyone?""","Have you ever paid the price for being a little too nice? ""The King's Chessboard"" was about a proud king in Deccan, India who paid the price for rewarding a wise man that didn't want to be rewarded. The King asked the wise man what would his reward be. The wise man said serving the King was his reward, but the King insisted on rewarding the servant. So, the wise man asked for one grain of rice. Then, each day for 64 days the wise man would recieve twice as much than the day before for each square on his chessboard. Things soon got out of hand because they were now giving the wise man tons of rice. By the end of the period they would have given out 274,877,906,944 tons of rice. The King had to stop the wise man from recieving these huge amounts of rice. In the end, the king would learn how easy it is for pride to make a fool of someone, even a king."
3,The book was informative but I feel it left out vital info,It was a good all around book(if you own various types of finches)and it was somewhat informative but vary vauge in the information that it did include. It is not a very good investment if you are looking for more of an educated outlook on the care and breeding of a certain group or type of finch.I would only recomend this book to the beginer because the more experienced bird keepers/breeders should already know all of this information.
2,"An ""Okay"" Finch Introduction Book with Nice Photos",The information is quite a general introduction to finches. But it is well worth the small price for the nice glossy embossed photographs of several species. Worthwhile to have as a handy photo reference on the shelf.
3,Ok for an adult hand,"I'm a 25 years old woman. My hands are small and it fits perfectly (let's remember that it's a child glove...). Only one problem, the size of the arms is too big, we must stuff it with something to fill it completely (a sleeve is not enough). Maybe put a bandage around the arms would do too. Anyway, I'm almost satisfied with the product as an ADULT but I highly do not recommend it for a child."
3,Anakin Skywalker Glove Gauntlet too big for a kid,"Nice glove, but it's supposed to be child-sized and it fits me; it's possible to get two 5-year-old arms in it up to the shoulder."
5,The richness of simplicity,"The more I read Swami Rama the more I have to recognize the power of simplicity and its richness. I am one of those who like to intellectualize a bit, but when I get confused enough all there is to do is go back to this very simple book. This book does not requiered any esoteric knowledge of yoga but just openess and sincerity from the reader. If you haven't read it, I almost envy you for the sweet pleasure waiting for you. Once you will have tasted Swami Rama's teachings I suggest you visit www.swamij.com , a treasure chest of informations and guidance by one of (if not the) closest disciple of Swami Rama."
5,Some real depth,"Also Sprach became famous because of its use in the movie ""2001"".Since that famous movie came out, it has been recorded more times than the music really deserves. It is a masterpiece but I would rank it behind most of the other Strauss tone poems. It is just a tad on the shallow side. But this recording by the great conductor Klaus Tennstedt, gives the music much more depth than it usually gets. He really takes the music seriously and I really enjoyed this performance. Don Juan also gets an outstanding performance. And what more can you say about Lucia Popp? She was simply a magnificent singer and a real artist. Her performance of the Four Last Songs is just breathtaking. If you reprogram this CD to play Don Juan first and Also Sprach last, you have a real concert program, soloist and all. At the budget price, this CD is a steal. A must for every classical music lover."
4,One of Turbo Grafx16's classic games!,"Vigilante is a game that is for the Turbo Grafx16 (which came out in 1987). It is a side-scrolling beat'em up type of game (like: Renegade,Kung Fu,Double Dragon). Your girlfrined (Madonna) is kidnapped by some punk a** skinheads. You must go through several levels/stages & fight them to get back your girl! As you go through the game, you can grab items such as nunchucks. It was a great game & had great graphics for it's time! It's a simple button game that can be somewhat repetetive, yet fun & replayable. I recommend this game to those that have a Turbo Grafx16, those that love old school games & fighters."
3,Not Fused together like Fused together.,"I listened to this cd today and I was actually anticipating it to come out. When i heard it, I thought it sounded like tough guy metal (ie throwdown, hatebreed) After listening to an amazing album like there first release you would think it could only get better. Oh well I was a Red Chord fan."
2,What the F*** is this?,"This is by far one of the worst cds I have ever heard. This singer is terrible and should be shot with a very heavy animal tranquilizer. I never was a big fan of grindcore or hardcore so I guess this isn't my cup of tea at all. The drummer is damn good though. He should start another band and leave these guys to play a half empty venue the rest of their lives with the likes of Blood Has Been Shed, Hatebreed, Bleeding through.Don't buy it because it sucks."
1,Sleeping Beauty,"Well, I purchased this Blu ray for my fiancee as a gift and was very happy that i got it for such a great price. But after sitting on the shelf for a few months we picked it up last week to watch it and it wouldn't load. I took the disc out of my player and cleaned it and it began to play but then skipped throughout the entire movie. I suppose I have learned my lesson about buying used Blurays. I love amazon, and will continue giving them my business, but wont buy from anyone but amazon from now on."
3,WHYYYYYYYYYYYY,"All I really have to say about this is that Sleeping Beauty should have been put in the Platinum Collection and not just a ""Special Edition"" dvd. Just like Mulan. They say the ""Platinum Editions"" are for the best disney films. These two movies and many more should be a part of it. Thank God The Little Mermaid is becoming one, they should have released The Little Mermaid Platinum Edition after Snow White and Before Beauty and the Beast, seeing as though The Little Mermaid was the movie that started the best of disney through Beauty and the Beast-The Lion King."
1,Sleeping Beauty Platinum Edition,"I'd love to be able to write a review regarding this product. However, it has been over a month since it was ordered but I have yet to receive it!I gave it one star but I'm sure, as a Disney product, once I actually GET IT, I'd rate it much higher.I don't believe I will purchase from this dealer in the future.Thank You"
1,poor quality,"I had a suspicion when I saw this product that it was a pirated version, and once I received it, I'm pretty sure it is. The quality of the dvd is poor...after the first viewing, it pixelates constantly in the beginning or just doesn't play at all. I should have trusted my first instinct and not purchased this dvd, especially considering how much it cost."
1,1 star for violince,"This movie was great but when i saw the dragon with the sword in her i wanted to cry I LOVE DRAGONS and the line ""now sword of truth fly swift and shure that evil die and good indure"" makes me freak out every time i watch it. It's really the three good faries faults because they helped the prince kill the poor drag-drag I WANT TO TEACH THOSE FAIRIES AND THE PRINCE A LESSON! [ONE THAT THE WILL NEVER FORGET] I somtimes feel like cussing at the prince for killing her they should make a seccond movie where they relive the dragon KISS YOUR BUT GOODBYE DRAGONSLAYERS!From the violince monotor"
1,THE STAR FOR MUSIC ONLY...,"This - in thirty year retrospect - is a dismally poor production.The script, so to speak, is laughable and way below Disney's norm.The artwork is terribly disappointing. Worse than CGI graphics today. Everything two-dimensional and static - like watching bad reruns of Clutch Cargo cartoons. Even the backgrounds lack depth and interest.Yes, there are colorful displays of fireworks, at times. An easy feat to accomplish.Overall - avoid this at all cost in favor his earlier works - any of them. This production shames Disney from beginning to end - and the 'extras' are a joke."
1,Ment for 4 and under year old girls.,"Thios movie is not a good adult movie. Trust me, it's for 4 year old GIRLS. 4 year old guys wuld say it's icky-poo-picky. And then get beat up by the 3-year-old."
4,thank you,"It looks great and will is going to make for a great gift, thanks again and have a great day"
4,Sleeping Beauty (Platinum Edition + Standard DVD and BD Live) Blu-Ray,"This is probably my favorite of the classic princess stories produced by Disney because Prince Philip is actually a character and doesn't just ride up at the end to sweep the girl off her feet. He has his own trials to get through before all ends happily ever after.This is a beautiful edition on blu-ray and the aspect ratio is a big part of that. It just looks more sweeping than prior editions. Color is spot-on throughout, and the audio is lovely. The fight with the dragon is gorgeous. I haven't had a chance to go through all the extras or the bd-live yet, but I hope to in the near future.I am also happy to have the standard DVD included so I can watch the movie on other DVD players or let relatives without blu-ray machines borrow it. I wish more blu-rays included this option instead of just digital copies.All in all, a beautiful addition to your blu-ray collection."
5,As good as I remembered!,"My whole family enjoys watching it together. It brings back a lot of memories. Being in Blu-Ray makes it even better for viewing. Highly recommended for big and small kids, young and old adults."
5,One of the best movies I have seen from Disney.,"A great adaptation of Tachovisty's opera! Disney knows how to pick the actors and actoress's that really fit the parts(especially this movie). This movie sticks to the story without lots of fabrication like some movies do,although this story is so great that you do not need to do anything to make it a masterpiece!"
5,A classic that lives on.,"This one's a great one. There's a mythology behind this and I think all women are to some extent, sleeping beauty's to be reawaked by thier personal prince with but a kiss. This film touches the soul of every woman out there and we men should step up to the plate and give great kisses to our girlfriends to wake her up from the evil spell of time."
5,Happy with the movie,This movie came in a timely manner. It was exactly what I wanted. Very good company to work with.
3,ANOTHER DVD?,"I was one of the fools who bought the 2-disc DVD of Sleeping Beauty a few years ago. Now, of course, Disney is bringing YET ANOTHER one out, claiming it is ""better."" How stupid do they think we are?It's just like what Lucas just did with the three Indiana Jones movies. Those were released five years ago in what we thought were the ""Ultimate"" version. Of course, they weren't.I'm sick and tired of being treated as a chump by Hollywood. Everyone should boycott these ""re-releases."""
3,Sleeping Beauty- DVD,"""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of my grandchildren's favorite Disney movies. I have had it on VHS for years, but decided to replace it with a DVD. The color is wonderful on the DVD and the sound is better by far. As everyone knows, it's a classic."
5,Great Movie,"I love this film, it's even better now that it's on Blu-Ray. I would have liked this video to have come with a digital copy, but the bonus DVD is okay too. I tried to put the DVD on my computer so I could add it to my iPhone, but it wouldn't work. :( Still, it's a great movie and I can't complain about the picture quality, even on the regular DVD. I'm really very happy with this purchase."
5,A Disney Classic!,"Grand kids LOVED IT! As always, Amazon ROCKS! FREE! Shipping, EXCELLENT QUALITY! And BEST PRICES! It just doesn't get any better than Amazon!"
5,Fond Childhood Memory,"This has to be the sweetest, most enchanting fairytale of all. How could I have ever forgotten this captivating fairytale? The three fairies that help protect the Princess Aurora, the mean, evil witch, Prince Phillip, the dragon, all spun together to make a tale that boys, girls, young & old would enjoy. I saw the beauty of this movie thru my eyes as a child, now my grand-daughters eyes.This timeless movie is a must for all children to see. Its a remembrance of a time when life was magical and beautiful, full of the things sweet dreams are made of."
4,The DVD lacks of something...,"The title has just been released in Mexico in DVD and I bought it as soon as I knew it was available. This is my favourite classic Disney movie and was expecting that all the extras would be treated in the same way as in Snow White or Beauty and the Beast, but was very dissapointed. Most of the ""Extras"" are just plain text and the menu in the second disc is very plain, nothing to talk about.The images are very clear and the sound very good, that's the least Disney could do for its very first movie in stereo."
5,Little girls love it,Sleeping Beauty is a favorite of little girls and our granddaughters will love. it. Delivery was prompt.
5,Sleeping Beauty Platinum Edition,"Color is fantastic, movie, still enchanting. A real WINNER! And Must Have for your DVD collection."
1,poor quality,"I ordered two copies of the DVD for Sleeping Beauty, one for each of my three year old granddaughters. The DVDs do not play correctly they skip a big chunk of the video and the color is off!! I will not order another DVD from amazon when the DVDs came -- on the back of the DVDs it says made in Mexico. These are not worth the money that I paid for them --- expected more from an Amazon product."
3,Not one of my fave Disney films,"For some reason, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'm really not into Sleeping Beauty. I adore Disney movies and have seen pretty much every one, with the exception of a couple. This does not rank high on my list. The story never really interested me, the music was just OK. It came as a bit old fashioned for me.That said, It's certainly not a bad movie by any means, just not as enjoyable as some of the other brilliant ones out there."
5,a classic,"This product arrived on time, was delivered as described, and completely met my expectations. No surprises, just a product that is as you would expect."
4,sleeping beauty,Loved it watched it as soon as I opened it . And then one week later .I plan to keep it and pass it down to my kids.
1,The Blue Ray disc was scratched and will not play.,"I understand I bought a set of used discs, but I don't feel a disc that is scratched so badly it wouldn't play, is not acceptable. I know the scratch was there when we received it because it was visible when we went to play it. Very disappointing.We didnt send it back because the other disc worked fine and returning it would have been very time consuming and would have cost more in gas than the DVD was worth."
5,Another classic Disney movie!,I purchased this for my daughters 3rd birthday and she loves it! It is wonderful to be able to share memories from my childhood with her!
5,Sleeping Beauty (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)DVD,"This is THE 2nd of our most TERRIFIC purchases via Amazon.com for our little princess lovers!!! They have SOOOO enjoyed our original video til its almost WORN OUT, so we were super happy to purchase the DVD version which they beg to watch EVERDAY! REALLY GREAT ITEM!"
3,Dysfunctional menus,"For those not familiar with how Blu-rays work, they have what is called a ""pop-up"" menu which is a menu that you can bring up without exiting the movie. Sometimes though, the pop-up menu and other features don't work as they should and in this case the pop-up menu doesn't always come up when I hit the button, and it requires bringing up the ""top menu"" which is like the menu on a standard DVD. But every time I do this, it goes back to the beginning of the movie and I have to navigate back to where I was and there are also loading screens between the menu and the movie."
2,DVD unreadable,"I bought the DVD/Blu-ray combo. I never played the Blu-ray, but the DVD was unreadable on my PC and DVD player. I returned the item."
5,TOTAL CLASSIC FROM 59!!!!,"Is it true? SLEEPING BEAUTY is from 1959??? It's just incredible!!! The graphics, the colors, the animation...in a time without computers and high techniques...THIS IS A PIECE OF ART!!!! The story is a remarkable fairy tale that most people can recognize, but DISNEY turns this thing in to a eternal masterpiece!!!"
5,A Magical Restoration,"It wasn't until a friend of mine showed me the restored version of this particular Disney classic that I realized what wonders it really does for an older animated film.Sleeping Beauty is brought back to life in this platinum edition with fully restored color and special features disc.A great investment for sure, and nothing beats having the ability to watch the classic magic of Disney at your fingertips."
5,Good movie to be the first Disney classic released on Blu-ray!,"The richness of the backgrounds, full of details, and the screen format make this film a good beginning for Disney classics in Blu-ray.Who collects Disney classics, or animated movies in general, must buy this BD."
3,Disney,This was one of those movies my niece watched all the time and I myself saw it in theaters when I was a kid. An evil sorceress puts a spell on a lovely girl and only a kiss by a handsome prince can awake her. In the end the witch turns into a dragon in a showdown at the end. And of course it has a happy ending. One of the best Disney movies along with Show White.
5,outstanding rendition of a classic,"ever since i was a child, sleeping beauty was my all time favorite disney animated motion picture. as soon as i saw it was available on blu ray, it was a dream come true. brilliant picture and sound make this timeless treasure just that much more special to watch. highly recommend for fans of this and other similar disney classics."
5,Hail Aurora and this Edition of Sleeping Beauty,"To be very honest, I debated on whether or not to purchase this edition of Sleeping Beauty because I have the 2003 version. I was skeptical because I was afraid that the bonus features on this new edition would excluded the Grand Canyon featurette and the Story of Peter Tchaikovsky until lo and behold, it was included. I have yet to have seen all of the bonus features of the DVD but the film looks and sounds greater than the 2003 version I noticed more detail and the sound was outstanding. The Disneyland Walk-Through feature was just breathtaking as this was the version I never saw.I strongly recommend this for any Disney fan!"
4,Sleeping Beauty,"It took really long for delivery, however, it's a great classic and worth it! I'm glad that even though it was sent back into the Disney Vault, I was still able to get it on Amazon!"
3,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!,"Oh! Sorry, I've just woken up. That name. Now, do you want a funny-bunny Snow White or Bambi? Well this IS NOT Bambi! As far as Disney fairy tales go, this is dark. Unfortunately, the film drags on. Queen Snoozy is a bit damsel in distress. However, some things in it good. Not one of Disney's best, but worth a watch."
2,Disappointing...,"I was so psyched to see this movie again--I LOVED this when I was a little girl! Sadly, it just isn't all that I remembered it to be--we (the hubby, my 2 year-old and my 5 year-old) almost fell asleep on this movie. It is slow-paced and uninteresting. The music is lame; the premise is lame. The fairies are still as fun as I remembered, but not good enough to carry an entire movie. Lest you think I am too picky, I do want to say that we all enjoyed Snow White, & Cinderella and both of these movies were made before my mother was born (I am 35 years-old). It is NOT that this movie is old--it's just boring."
2,Okay Film - Poor Extras,"This was sneaked out onto release on region 2 disc ages ago in England (minus commentary). Although the film is visually stunning and has some nice set pieces it lacks warmth and, with some small exceptions, has no compelling characters. The extras are as dry as sticks and smack of the pompous. If you want a special edition Disney disc stick to 'The Lion King' or 'Beauty and the Beast'."
3,"Well...not as bad as Snow White, but still...","This movie ranks with the films about the floaty princess who has to get rescued by a handsome prince she's only met once and, of course, fell madly in love with just because he was cute. Blah, blah, blah. Still, I'll give this movie three stars due to the good comedy the three good fairies provided, and the totally awesome villain--one of the best Disney's every created.Like Snow White, young girls will like this movie. If you're older, then you'll probably start yawning after a little while. Still, I can understand why a lot of people like it. It's colorful, and has a good amount of adventure. The music's not all that great, and nobody really learns anything...but oh well. It's a fairy tale. Go figure. An enjoyable thing for young kids to watch or to just pass the time if there's nothing else to do, but it's not amoung my top favorite Disney films."
2,"A ""Beauty"" of a DVD",Sleeping Beauty has been a classic story for centuries and now it's special edidtion release on DVD means more people can see this tale the way it was meant to be told and although it's a great story with brillient animation and an excellent plot it doesn't quite match up to some Disney classics like The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Sorry folks but this tale ain't gettin' a high vote fae me.
2,Another twisted Disneyfication of a classic fairy tale...,"This is another Disney ""classic"" in which almost all sense of the original fairy tale has been removed. In this case, things like rape, adultery, cannibalism and more. In place of the original story line Disney adds annoying soprano's trilling away, an evil witch that turns into a dragon, and a 16 year slumber party at the good fairies house!?! To experience the real Sleeping Beauty I suggest reading Giambattista Basile's ""Sole, Luna, E Talia"", Charles Perrault's ""The Sleeping Beauty In The Wood"", or even the Grimm's ""Brier Rose"". Disney destroys real classic fairy tales and controls the minds of your children."
1,a Kid's review,"It gives me nightmares, this is the most worst movie I've ever seen. My mother didn't like this movie because of the 3 fairies in it, we don't believe in good witches. of course the second fairy who had a blue dress was a very mean one. and the movie gave me nightmares because their is a scary fairy but that's not the scariest part the most scariest part of this is the music. The music was so scary I got terrified. So please don't buy this movie your children might get scared like I did also."
5,GREAT,"GREAT FLICK FOR THE LITTLE PRINCESS IN YOUR LIFE, A CLASSIC, IT WILL NEVER LOSE IT'S VALUE OR POPULARITY"
5,kid at heart,"I'm old enough to remember this movie when it was first released. Loved it then, love it now. One of Disney's best."
4,Music,"I have a 16 month old son who loves this movie. He is really into the music. When the songs start he dances and really lights up. I have even seen him kiss the TV. Its a great kids movie. It seems like all little kids like the movies with the babys in them. Its a great way to catch there attention right at the begining, and then the way it flows with the music and the farries it realy keeps there attention the hole way throug."
5,Probably Disney's best movie.,"Sleeping Beauty, even though it is an animated film, it's one of the best Disney films, if not the best. I really enjoyed watching it...very entertaining for the kids and enjoyable to watch again and again. You should go and see it if you haven't already and if you have, see it again and again, preferrably with some young ones."
3,Not As Good As It Could've Been!,"I actually rate this 3.5 stars. I remember seeing this as a kid and noticing that the characters were drawn flat and there didn't seem to be as much attention to detail as in previous Disney films! A lot of the townspeople and palace guards are drawn VERY cartoonish! The color is gorgeous though and this was the first Disney animated film to use the widescreen process with stereophonic sound, but the beautiful Tchaikovsky score isn't used to it's best advantage... in my opinion! The only meeting we have with Aurora, (Sleeping Beauty), is in a long song with her and the forest animals, and that's not long enough to get to know her. The focus is more on the good fairy's... Also, this is one of the few films that a ""Prince Charming"" has a lot more screen time than the heroine in a Disney film! Nevertheless, this film has enough to recommend it, although the evil Maleficent would be too scary for very little kids."
1,Is this Legal?,"All packaging says it's Sleeping Beauty, 50th Anniversary, Platinum Edition. DVD says the same, but it's the Aladdin movie! Needless to say, my daughter was very disappointed. How can this happen?! How nice the seller was to let me know I can return it, but I pay for the shipping. Will NOT be using this seller again."
3,"I agree with ""Summersweet""...",But I do give it more credit because of the beautiful backgrounds and classic animation.
5,What a great deal!,"Since I own a Blu-ray player (PS3,) I prefer to buy mostly Blu-ray discs. However, the added cost of Blu-ray discs forces me to buy DVDs where it makes sense. For instance, big special effects movies are always great for Blu-ray... comedies or dramas, not so much.Since this edition comes with a standard DVD in addition to the Blu-ray content, this was a no-brainer. If my 5-year-old wishes to watch this movie, the DVD it is. For my wife and I, it's the Blu-ray."
4,Disney Sleeping Beauty movie,"It's a classic Disney movie. My 3 year old son loves Maleificent, the Dragon at the end of the movie. It's a good movie overall."
5,Keep the Grandkids occupied,They love it.....and you will love a little dowm time while they enjoy it ! A MUST for any grandparent !
5,A Classic,"This is a must for the kids library of movies. It's a wonderful story, it beautiful to watch. It's great for kids and adults who are really a kid at heart."
5,Very Happy,I bought this movie for my 3 yr old and we got it right away. The quality was exactly what we expected. I couldn't be happier with this purchase
4,Good for the price :),"It worked great for the first several months, but now for some odd reason it won't play towards the end. It just skips and won't play the last 10 minutes. I cleaned it, looked for scratches and there were not any, so I have no idea if its just my DVD player (although all other movies play fine) or if its just because the movie is just very well used/loved and needs to be replaced now. Either way, I am still happy it got here in time for Christmas and my kids loved it while it lasted."
4,A classic,"I remember watching this movie as a little girl and falling in love with it. Now that I have 2 little girls of my own, I had to get it for them. Truth be told, they didn't really enjoy it very much. It was pretty boring for them in the beginning, but paid attention towards the end. I just think they're more into the Disney movies with lots of action and songs(Toy Story, Tangled, Princess and the frog). Overall, it's a beautiful movie."
5,Disney Has Done It Again!,I collect the Disney Classics and this new Blu-Ray did not dissapoint. It was beautifully remastered in both picture quality and audio. The colors are so amazing in this upgrade and the characters we fell in love with as children are just as grand as they once were. This is a wonderful gift idea for anyone. Highly recommend!
4,good transaction,"this transaction went very well, i got my DVD in a timely manner and have already enjoyed watching it."
2,Disappointed...,"I was more than thrilled to pay the $70 dollars to own this timeless classic, as it is one of my faves.The reason why I didn't rate my purchase 5 stars are for a few reasons. First it arrived a day later than what I was was predicted. I didn't think too much of it, however, the problem was it arrived with scuffs and scratches on the plastic housing the cover art. The case had a crack on the upper corner of the blu ray case. I was under the impression that I would be receiving something that looks new as it was deemed on the packaging. It was also just the blu ray case with the dvd sleeve taped over the case. Was it not supposed to be in some sort of box-set? Overall, I love this movie but I'm extremely disappointed at the condition the film arrived in. I feel as though I paid more money for something that may not have been as much as I spent. Oh well..."
5,Satisfied Customer,"I order Sleeping Beauty and it can in less time than expected. Movie plays great, so i am very satisfied with service and movie."
5,sleeping beauty dvd,This movie was in like new codition ! It was delivered in less then a week ! What a great deal a disney movie in great condition and less then $10 !
5,Best Disney Movie Ever,"Well, those who are looking into buying this probably know what a wonderful amalgam of breathtaking artwork, beautiful songs and scores it all is..."
3,Don't expect the disney movie rewards code,"It seem's like they repackage it I thought I was buying a brand new blu-ray, before they repackage it they took away the only reason I buy disney movies is for the rewards code, but is expected coming from a third party"
3,Loved Olga hated the DVD .....,It doesn't get much better than Olga ... She is hot hot hot and her voice just seems to keep on giving ....What I didn't like as the quality of the DVD .... even though they are videos of some of her latest releases most of them are older than dirt and so is the quality of the sound ....Sorry I sure had better hopes
2,Maybe they changed the ingredients recently.....,"I really have no idea how this product has so many positive reviews. It tastes like cardboard. I've tried fruit, nuts, poppyseeds and even chocolate. Nothing makes these taste better. I've very thankful that I got these on the clearnace rack at the grocery store (although now I know why they were on clearance!)"
5,One of the Best GF Produts I have had,Haven't made them myself but I had them at a function I went to today. They were one of the best gluten free pastries I have tasted and my 4 year old daughter agreed. They looked exactly like the picture on the box.
4,Great Product !,"I do not like alot of sugar, as little as possible, as a matter of fact. This product does not have alot of sugar. It tastes wonderful, is easy to prepare and agrees with me because it is Gluten-free as opposed to all the other boxed products on the market. I love this product and recommend it to all my friends.Amazon is incredible.....they make it easy - they make it even easier than easy...it comes to your door step in 2 days, never a hassle.....Amazon is the greatest there is.....I use Amazon all the time.Gluten-Free Pantry Muffin & Scone mix is first rate !."
5,i love this book!,"the author is my dad so naturally i love it but it was informative as well as fun to read and the climax, plot and characters were so well described! good job dad!"
5,You Gotta Hear This!,"I dug this out of my archives recently and was reminded how great an album that it was ... and still is. Very underrated work. Some deep and devastating tunes on here; inspired and passionate music, real creativity at work, elevated by the singing and those lovely harmonies. Just when you think it couldn't get any better, along comes the closing medley --- clever covers of Prince's ""1999,"" ""Once in a Lifetime"" by Talking Heads, and Harry Nilsson's ""Coconut"". What a delight! Listening to that medley always has me smiling in appreciation --- and pleasure --- that they could merge such a seemingly crazy trio of songs into one seemless piece of music. Great work."
4,Amazing music.,"I bought this CD 5 years ago, have since misplaced it thru hurricane or human mishap, and it's a piece of music I genuinely miss. The sweet emotive synchronicity of vocals and melody keep this group in rare company ( Stevie Wonder, Julie Miller, Pieta Brown come to mind). Add to it some genuinely thoughtful philosophizing and you have a CD that lingers in the mind long after listening.I just read of PM Dawn's dramatic mishaps over the past few years, which explains why I haven't heard more of their original sound. Here's my well-knowing for Prince Be and his future artistic endeavors."
2,The thrill is gone,"It pains me to say this, but I didn't like this album as much as the first two. There's no edge, no bounce, no rap! Prince Be is a great rapper (when most rap sucks), but we don't get to see it on this album. No killer beats or hooks. (The one exception is probably ""Sometimes I Miss You So Much"" that has a sample of Al B. Sure's ""Night and Day"" in it.) It's good for background ambiance on a lazy day, but it doesn't demand my attention, and I couldn't lose myself in it."
4,'Sample Nirvana',"If you like The Bliss Album, you should like this one as well. Once again P.M. Dawn combine some smart sampling with cool beats and deep lyrics. It is quite flowing. There are a lot of memorable songs, I especially like some of the slower ones. They are peaceful, which is refreshing. This is perfect music to mellow out too...Some of my favorites are: ""I'll Be Waiting For You""/""Apathy...Superstar? ""/""Why God Loves You""/""Sonchyenne""/""A Lifetime."""
4,Works well maybe not worth the price,I live in an apartment and the size of the HVAC is weird. We got this filter to help with some of the odors in the air. It works a little better than a regular 3M one but I do not think it is worth the premium.
4,Such Great Music!!!!!,Each song flows and the content of it has a message that u don't hear in alot of music today. The arrangement of the music and vocals is clever and a pleasure to listen to.
4,"Smooth, quality music!","Never heard of this dude, but he surprised me and now I'm a fan. What a delicious album! All songs are of high quality and so smooth and you can call it a mixture neo-soul, jazzy, r&b, soul, but no matter what you call it. There's no question, this is easy listening and very beautiful. My favorites are ""Honeydew"" and ""Really do"". You should definitly check this one out!"
3,THE TITAN SLEEP WALKS,THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.MEHTA IS UNINSPIRED AND SPINELESS IN THIS INTERPRETATION.THE ORCHESTRA PLAYS FINE BUT IT ALL SOUNDS TOTALLY CONTRIVED AND SELF CONSCIOUS.THE FIRST MOVEMENT LACKS THE OMINOUS MYSTERY AND THE SPARKLE OF DISCOVERY.THE SECOND MOVEMENT LACKS THE GUSTO AND THRUST THAT MAKES IT IGNITE.THE THIRD MOVEMENT LACKS VISION AND CREATIVE STYLISH PHRASING TO MAKE THE GHOULISH DREAM COME ALIVE.THE FOURTH MOVEMENT LACKS A REAL EXPLOSIVE MOMENTUM. IT KICKS BUT ITS SELF CONSCIOUS AND IT SOUNDS FORCED INSTEAD OF NATURAL.IRONICALLY THE ONLY MOVEMENT THAT SOUNDS SPONATANEOUS AND FREE OF INTELLECTUAL BINDING IS THE BLUMINE MOVEMENT THAT MAHLER DROPPED BEFORE THE PREMIERE...TO SUM IT UP...YOU GET A WELL EXECUTED PERFORMANCE LACKING VISION AND SPONTANTEOUS CREATION.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY IF YOU KNOW BETTER.TRY TENNSTEDT ON EMI OR WALTER ON SONY FOR A REAL TITAN MAHLER 1.LONG LIVE MAHLER!O.F.
4,"lp2/3 very"" respectively...extreme leftfield talented prog. rock us band...","don't forget lp1 either-on here, ice, the 1st song i heard on wtul college radio, after first seeing CTS on back of one's t-shirt in e. jeff. high school n.o.,la, then got it at an lp store. sadly unknown rock group but a great discovered rock jem from our own country-baltimore, md. as far as i know, they've only still been jammin in that town. their songs are in the classic, prog., altn., rock genre with wonderfully balanced rhythum/time changes w/ classical music style compositions creating wonderfull rock ballad concepts -(mostsongs). their ""best lps, in order"" i know so far are: crackthesky, animalnotes, safetyinnumbers and worldinmotion. they sound like a number of rock groups/styles. LETS GIVE EM 5 STARS HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,All The Reviewers Are Right!!,"I had ""Staircase of a Thousand Steps"" on my night table, about three books down. Seeing the great editorial and customer reviews here, I was skeptical. Could a book be That Good? Yes, I just finished it (in a marathon reading session). It is: That Good. I agree with what all the reviewers, both professional and customers, have said. It has been one of the great reading experiences this year. I teach Middle East Studies here in Vermont and so must read a great deal about the area. But this transcends anything I've read to date because it is true fiction that also gives readers a window onto a distant time and place. Ms. Hamilton is, without question, a superior novelist. Her characters are perfectly created--they come fully alive on the page. Her book is: fascinating, captivating and most of all, intensely moving."
5,Unforgettable!,"I've never read anything like this, never been to a place like this, never met characters like this. By the time I was a third of the way in, I became thoroughly lost in the story - one that is both timeless and modern. And the characters have found a place in my heart - Harif and Jammana, Rafa and Khalah, and especially Faridah, the fiery and free-spirited midwife. This is a book I will pull off the shelf and read over and over."
4,Just finished this good novel,"It takes a little patience to find your way here. The author has great talent and my main critique is that her characters are related in confusing ways and that the first half of the book is not as flowing as the second. But do not give up because once Ms. Hamilton finds her flow, she'll grab you. Just a little confusing at the outset."
2,Deceptively surprising,"The many good customer reviews encouraged me to buy this book, with one eye pointing at women stories and one pointing at knowledge of other cultures and different realities. Although the book is well written and the story engaging, its placement in the desert seems arbitrary and not faithfull to geographical and gender reality = I did not learn anything new about the desert and Islam, nor about women. It was a nice, easy to consume fuilleton."
4,i try so hard not to like it,"-it doesn't represent early club culture in the least-its more like a representation of the dying electroclash fad of the late 90s/early 00s-but i love it anywaythis is fun music from a fun movie. its not classic in any shape or form, but if you missed out on buying any of the electroclash comps, then pick this up as a tiny piece of history."
3,Party Monster,Dies anyone know the name of the song playing when the rat tells James about the murder? It was catchy and I downloaded everything by pm I could find
4,perfect night out on the town,"hmm....well, what can i say. i simply adore this soundtrack. it has everything i love about modern dance (felix, ladytron) and eighties dance (stacey q, shannon). plus it has what is in my opinion the best band out there right now, SCISSOR SISTERS!!!! seriously, if you like to dance to GOOD music go out and pick this up. it is quite amazing."
4,great stuff....,"...as a reviewer below, I leave this in my player and listen to it over and over. Not for the techno-challenged, though."
1,A complete waste of Money--a total ripoff,You could retrieve the same info from any search engine. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. To the customer from Rhode Island that was looking for wine on the internet this book does not even mention Winebid.com or WineAuction.com the two largest internet wine auction houses.
1,Nothing more than a print-out of a web search.,"This book was nothing more than a print-out of a web search. It contains no useful information in addition to a listing of auction sites. Since the auction picture is changing every day, it is even outdated. This is a good example of someone trying to make a quick buck off the internet."
5,Roger the Jolly Pirate,My children loved this book and laughed histarically. The art is fantastic.The book arrived before it was due and was in great condition.
5,"Roger, the Jolly Pirate","Roger has a problem. He is too jolly and kind. Whenever there is a fight, the other pirates send him below and out of the way. Just before one fight was to begin, Jolly was again sent down below. He was sad that the other pirates didn't like him. He got a great idea! He would make them a cake. He found what looked like a big pot to bake the cake in. He put in any ingredients he could find. He stirred the ingredients. Jolly found a place to light the pot so that he could bake his cake. What a surprise! (You'll have to get the book to find out what it was.) All of the men they were fighting fled from fright. The other pirates thought Jolly was GREAT! They even made a flag to honor him. Most pirate ships fly this flag; they call it the Jolly Roger.This is a delightful pirate story. The illustrations are vivid and alive with action. The text is just the right length for preschool and above. One of my favorite pirate books!"
1,Do not buy this lamp!!!!!,"The part of this lamp that holds the light bulb, broke off fromthe main frame of this lamp.A piece of junk!!!!!! I can no longer adjust the light part of this lamp, it just hangs down from the lamp's arm frame."
3,Swing Arm 75 Watt Desk Lamp,"The lamp was functional and appeared as shown in the illustration. The assembly was simple. The on/off switch was poor, it was difficult to switch the light on but easy to switch it off. It is a less than optimum on/off switch."
4,Catalina Lighting Fixture,"The lighting fixture is nice. However, it would have been even nicer if it also came in white."
3,"Leo, get Real!","Again, enjoyable in the true sense of the Lethal Weapon movies, this one has our 2 heroes bullying innocents and laughing about it (oh, those loveable cops); Leo Getz going places no civilian could go and getting slapped like a 3 Stooges foil, except his vulgarity increases (wait until LW 4). Now Riggs is not crazy at all, that's all gone, but he's in LUV.... with a dog and a female alter ego. The bad guys are a little trite, and unreal, but this IS a fiction.Watch out for LW 4, it gets hypocritical. Every police department respects and depends on the NRA for their training and gun handling, only this one has anti-NRA posters on the wall. Yeah, right! The ""Holly-weenies"" came out in force in that one. And the ""F"" word must cover half the script for ""LW 4"". Thanks, I'll take my wife and kids just for laughs."
2,Worst of the series!,"Not even LW4 can compare to the stench reeking of of this turkey. While LW4 was stupid, This picture is boring and stupid. And at least the fourth entry had Jet Li playing a villan. This picture has an empty-headed brainless and boring dirty-cop played by the terribly mediocre Stuart Wilson. There is not an ounce of imagination in this whole movie. It's like an episode of ""Hunter"" with a bigger budget. Mel is not even a lethal weapon anymore. A better title for Martin Riggs would be ""Mildly Eccentric Weapon"""
2,This weapon is unloaded!,"The worst entry in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, (the first will always be the best), ""Lethal Weapon 3"" suffers from too much comedy and a very uninteresting story. Richard Donner, who throws a ridiculously stupid left-wing temper tantrum throughout the film by inserting little hidden messages in scenes and dialogue, directs this film with a lack of concern for quality. It's like he was thinking, ""Oh what the hell! People come to see Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Forget about an interesting story. Just make some things blow up real good and put in a couple of car chases!"" The action is only so-so and the comedy, well...it really isn't comedy. The story involves Mel and Danny trying to stop a criminal from putting guns in the hands of local gang members. There are other plot points as well but nothing of great interest or amusement. We also get an additional member of the team played by Rene Russo who seems to hold her own fairly well. Just rent the original."
2,Russo Makes This One Two Stars,"They add Rene Russo to this movie to help us remember that Mullet Gibson is hetero sexual or at least to make us forget that the homoerotic love fest between he and Glover is strictly buddy buddy (yeah right). Mullet still hams it up with his tongue in cheek, wink wink, obnoxious Three Stooges gimmick and then they add Joe Pesci as a motormouth obnoxious cartoon character who actually gets on Mullets nerves though he can't see that his own stOOpid antics might make everybody else hate him as much as Pesci. This takes the Lethal Weapon franchise even further into funny book land and the movie suffers for it. It is more like Pesci, Gibson and Glover having a cutesy cutesy good time and letting the fans in on it than it is a good movie."
5,Lethal Weapon 3,Mel Gibson's zany character contiues to interact well with his partner to present another fine episode in the Lethal Weapons series.
4,the boys are back and a girl,"Lethal Weapon 3 comes fast and furious but mostly importantly it delights everyone with wisecracks,action, and camaderie. So if you want to continue with the buddy cops watch Lethal Weapon 3"
3,"3 stars for ""Lethal 3""","""Lethal Weapon 3"" should have been called ""Lethal Weapon Lite"". This film is ""lite"" on story and suspense which the first two films excelled at. At the same time though ""Lethal 3"" is a fun film. While the first two movies mixed action and drama with the comedy, this film is almost all comedy with occasional action conveniently place to keep the audience from getting too restless.Watching this film is a lot like watching outtakes. There are many scenes which have no relation to each other. The film is filled with gags and jokes which feel like they're made up on the spot. A lot of it is fun but it just fills in where the story is weak. The plotline this time is the weakest in the series and focuses on Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo Getz trying to stop an ex-cop who has become an arms dealer.Most of the action takes place at the end and is appropriately ""Lethal Weaponish"". The film is not a total loss, it's mostly good fun."
3,"Not the best, but it holds it's own.","If you like the other Lethal Weapon movies, then you will at least find this one entertaining. True, it is the weakest of the entire ""quadrilogy"", but it holds its own as a Lethal Weapon movie. The ""director's cut"" is especially interesting."
2,Audio mastering problems damage otherwise great movie,"There seems to be a problem with the 5.1 audio mastering of the disc. The score oftentimes overwhelms the dialog and in some instances sounds out of focus and is distracting. In addition, the dialog sounds muddy and is difficult to listen to at times. This probably will only be evident on a Dolby Digital home theater system with the volume turned up....."
1,"A waste of time, space and life.","How far the mighty fell. The first film in this series was an amazing take on the tired cop genre, finally giving the world a protagonist cop who was not some boring stoic or wise-cracking good guy. Riggs was dark, disturbed and suicidal. By the third installment the whole tone of the films changed to this mindless dreck. If only one could excise the last two Lethal Weapon movies."
5,the best in the series,"in my opinion this is the best one in the series. why because just the way the scenes were done. they were outstanding. don't get me wrong all the films in the series are great i just happen to think this one is the best. rated r for strong violence,and language"
5,One of Gino's Best,"Yonder Tree is simply the highlight of Gino's creative works. I love it!How can you beat the late, fabulous Gregory Hines tap dancing in and out of ""Fallin in Love?"" It's pure genius! My favorite song is ""Jehovah and All That Jazz."" It's such a jazzy, happy song I can't help smilin' and dancin' to it. This song really showcases Gino's vocal ability--a FINE piece of work in every way, as is ""Walter Whitman Where Are You?""What can you say about ""Come to the Well""--except, it's a fabulous musical picture of intimacy. Man, how does he do it?I don't understand why this CD hasn't been more successful because it seems more ""Gino"" than anything else he's done. Every serious Gino fan MUST have this CD in their collection."
3,GINO AND ALL THAT JAZZ,"Gino Vannelli's music has always possessed strong jazz influence, melded with pop, rock and blues. Y0NDER TREE is essentially a straight ahead jazz effort, with the excepti0n 0f the album's final track.Despite the sheer brilliance of the musicianship and Gino's powerful vocals, this is one of my least favorite Vannelli albums. I must also note that I'm not a jazz devotee, so that certainly affects my critique.However, love that final track--MOON OVER MADNESS. It's theatrical allusion to a vampire is creative genius, reminding me why I like Mr. Vannelli anyway!"
2,Oh well........had to end.,"Oh well, I guess artists have to grow. Unfortunately, Gino grew into something that I did not like. This album kinda sucks. It must be a Canadian thing because Rush moved from one (terrific) style to a good style too.I am not saying this album totally blows, it is just that I wanted more from one of my favorite artists. Looks like the gino-boat has left the dock without me. Still, there are lots of earlier fantastic albums from GV to fall back on and they are timeless and tireless."
3,Should have been a short story,"""The Port Wine Sea"" starts out well, with a laugh-per-paragraph for O'Brian fans (the first sentence is, as parody, dead-center perfect), but for me, the joke wears thin quickly. There's just not enough to fill out an entire book."
4,Great fun if you have the background,"To enjoy this great little parody to the utmost, you need certain qualifications. One, you have to have read (and loved) the POB Aubrey/Maturin series. Secondly, you have to have a sense of fun. Thirdly, to have to enjoy someone having a real ball playing with words (and music). With those qualifications, you will have a wonderful time, for there is no joke like the ""in-joke"" -- and this is what this fun with ""Captain Audibly"" and ""Stephen Natterling"" (who needs his daily pint of opium to function on three cylinders) is all about (they even get to meet with Horatio Hornbearer, with predictably hilarious results. This is a great little book for a rainy day or a long, tedious flight -- except that it would be nice to have a like-minded friend beside you, so you could read out delicious tidbits every now and then. Brava, Susan Wenger!"
4,Simultaneously raucous and deep.,"Ms Wenger's re-working of Patrick O'Brian is simultaneously raucous and deep, as perhaps only a truly affectionate parody can be. Port-Wine Sea pokes cheerful fun at our devotion to O'Brian and his characters rather than at the books or - Heaven forfend! - the author himself."
2,"Slow, forced, weak parody. Disappointing.","Its a shame, but i'm only up to chapter four and I'm having trouble keeping awake. The author is perhaps a bit too proper to write a good parody. This O'brian series is a delight but it is also plump and ripe for a rollicking, wicked, down-and-dirty lampooning. Mrs Wegner just isn't up to it (as if you couldn't tell she's just too nice of a lady from her picture). So far the jokes are tedious, thin, and lacking in depth. I really really wanted this to be good, but its not, which is a shame after all the work I had to go to to locate a copy.Don't waste your time, this would do better as fan fiction on a web page. Me...I'm going to reread Bored of the Rings to remind myseld of what a parody is supposed to be. (To be fair parody is tough...the harvard lampoon failed pretty badly on their 2nd try, Doon.)"
2,An enervating parody,"A parody neither particularly inspired nor artful which, like most works of this type, grows tiresome when the novelty wears off after the first few pages. I can't recommend it unless you're a die-hard Patrick O'Brian fan who's devoured the whole series (and similar works by other writers) and is at a complete loss for something to read."
4,Very Good CD by Todays Standards,"Most Rap CD's only have one or two good tracks on them but The B. Coming will pleasantly surprise you with 8 out of 15. ""Feel It In The Air"", ""Tales Of A Hustler Pt.2"" and ""It's On feat. Jay-Z"" are 3 of the strongest. Another nice surprise on this CD is that there are NO LAME, TIME WASTING, IGNORANT SKITS in between songs. The only downside to this CD is that there may be too many guess rappers for my taste but considering Beanie Sigel's current situation, I can understand the need for callabos. I strongly recommend this CD to any fan of Rap."
3,Beanie Sigel - The B. Coming,"Pretty good album. I was feeling most of it, but some of it I wasnt feeling. As of today, this is the first album that I have heard from Beanie. I liked it. The production was on point most of the time, some of the tracks I felt as if the beat didnt match well with the lyrics and style he was putting into it. But none the less, Beanie did spit some real lyrics on most of the tracks. Good thing he wasnt mostly on a bubblegum tip or I wouldnt have felt it at all. I respect him for spittin that real stuff. ""Feel It In The Air"" is a HOTT joint. Love that track. If you want a pretty good rap album to check out, get this, youll like it. Overall I give this album about a 3.5/5. Beanie can rap, I like his style, I heard his older stuff is better so im going to check that next.My Top 5 Songs1.Feel It In The Air2.I Cant Go On This Way3.Purple Rain4.Change5.Lord Have Mercy"
3,"Ok, but NOT his best.","this album is ok but i expected something much better. the b.coming sounds like the ""chain gang"" album and the song one shot deal sounds like a beat that has been used for the Young Gunz."
3,Beanie sigel,"beanie sigel's new album is out. he got another one came out in april. this one gets 3 out of 5. Good tracks are One Shot Deal - Redman, I Can't Go On This Way Freeway and Look at Me Now."
4,Beans is Back,"Some people hate on this album because its not commercial, but comercial aint Beanies style he is street. finishing this album right before being incarcerated Beans comes hard with the best lyrics of his career. spitting like he is hungry on all tracks. the single ""Feel It In The Air"" is a classic. this CD is not one to bang with yo homies, its one to bump on ur headphones and actually listen to. Cop this CD one of the best of the year."
3,Quick read,"It probably took the writer less time to write this than it will for you to read it. It's one of those pulp books that get churned out quickly, in case the pop sensation it's about fades before the book hits the shelves. But if you know nothing about this band, this a decent place to start. I went to the same high school (Corona del Mar High School) as Mark McGrath and Stan, so, aside from loving their music, I have a sentimental feeling for the band. (I graduated just before their freshman year, so missed them by a year, so never got to pass them in the school halls). It's funny to read, though, that Rodney played Shaka in ""Land of the Lost"" for 5 episodes because I knew in high school the guy who replaced him as Shaka: Philip Paley! Which means, too, I'm afraid, that Rodney is older than he lets on! I don't care. I love Sugar Ray!"
5,Great Book!,I got this book at my local bookstore and it is really good. It's very informative if you are not a huge fan. I am and it still had things I didn't know and I enjoyed. Everyone should get this book!!! MARK'S HOT!!!
2,Not what I expected.,I am disappointed in the quality. Poles for mop heads are very flimsy and mop/broom don't stay on pole very well. Kids love the set but I don't feel it will last long under constant use. I am surprised that the little Tikes brand would not have better quality. I would not recommend this product based on the brand name or quality of construction for the price paid.
3,Okay book,The book was good but hard to follow at times. Very interesting to read and leaves you thinking about the world and photography.
3,On Photography is Recanted in Regarding the Pain of Others,Susan recants many of the things she says in On Photography in her book Regarding the Pain of Others published in 2003.
4,Recommended for serious photographers,"Before I read this book I heard from my photography master ""I wouldn't buy it. I'm afraid it's too loaded with all that artistic talking we hear everywhere around. You know, I would start photographing stones, bushes and claim it as a great fine art. I would stop seeing photography"".Well, I didn't start photographing bushes, after all, so stop worrying ;)This is not a book one can read at one sitting, nevertheless, it's worth recommending. Susan wrote about many things aspiring photographers think about - despite she wasn't photographer herself.I'm convinced that for reading this book one has to know a little bit about Photography Masters, their work and Photography at all. It's not a book for beginners, but worth trying. To encourage you, here is what Susan wrote in it:""The ultimate wisdom of the photographic image is to say, 'There is the surface. Now think - or rather feel, intuit - what is beyond it, what the reality must be like if it looks that way."""
5,Still pertinent and thoughtful,"Ms. Sontag's collection of texts (which I believe were originally published as separate newspaper articles) still offer food for thought despite their age. Her thoughts on history, current events, and the modified perception of both through the medium of photography continue to be pertinent. This is an interesting read for those unaquainted with theoretical texts, and an important reference for those with more experience."
1,"Self-enclosed, all-too-verbal critique divorced from subject...","Sonntag's gift for language is explanation enough for why she probably took few pictures and certainly not enough to justify cramming image-making into the worn categories of reproduction, oppression, and escapism. If you've got nonverbal photographic friends all too assured of the purity of their craft, this book should play counterpoint nicely. Otherwise, consider this text another example of theory uncomfortably distanced from the object of its gaze."
3,Its a good thing...,"It is a great thing I had my pocket dictionary with me when I read this book. A photographer my self I understand what she is arguing, but could she have used bigger words??? It was torture to read some times."
1,so very boring and arrogant,"I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it.If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor."
3,GIFT,"I have no idea what the book is about nor do I care, it was a gift and it was delivered to me in a relatively timely fashion (by this I mean mediocre; please keep in mind I am overseas with a military address/APO, AP). The end. Rating based on delivery only."
1,"Pompous, elitist crap","What a load of garbage. Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed. She has no idea waht she is talking about."
4,"We flirt ,therefore we speak",Who knew we learned to speak so we could flirt with one another and foil each others romantic schemes!? A fascinating read for non-scientists and genuine evolutionary psycologists alike.Robin Dunbar supports the idea with thoroughness that prompts other sciences to site the work.
5,Another Treasure!,"This is another beautiful story from the magical pen of Judith Lansdowne. As with her other wonderful Regencies, this story is told with fluid style and grace. It is quite unusual as the hero spends a great deal of his time bedridden and it is through the other charming and loveable characters that you get to know and dearly love our hero, the Earl of Wright (Jocelyn). This is a touching novel filled with humour, wit, and stunning characterizations. You will want to read this one over and over.. A real keeper! (I don't think Judith Lansdowne could write a bad novel even if she tried! What a wonderful storyteller!"
5,Best country ever,This is one of the best cd's I have heard in a long time. I have rarely heard a voice like Wesley's. His voice is pure and he sings straight from the heart. He is one of those rarities that can make you feel every emotion he pours out. Every song on this cd is excellent. We are all awaiting more from Wesley as I know anything he does will be outstanding.
5,"It isn't ""My Imagination"" that this song is HOT!","What an awesome song, and what a voice! She sounds so mature on this track. The lyrics in this song are really cool, and the breaks/beats are even better. I have not heard any more from SK8 since this single was released. I guess this just could not be topped. It was huge in the clubs for quite a while, for good reason. There have been some really awesome remixes of this song done by other DJ's. An excellent pick-up if you can get it! If you liked my review, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
3,SK8's MUSIC IS JUST FOR CLUBS..,"20-YEAR-OLD SK8 FIRST SINGLE""MY IMAGINATION"" SEEMS LIKE A RADIO FRIENDLY SONG BUT IT IS NOT.THIS IS FOR DANCE CLUB MUSIC. THE VIDEO IS KINDA OF WERID BUT IT IS COOL IT HAS LFO'S BRAD.SK8 WILL NOT BE AS BIG AS BRITNEY OR CHRISTINA BUT MAYBE YOU WILL HERE OF HER ONE IN A WHILE."
2,VHS version-Vs. Another Tupac Documentary,"Another 2pac Documentary basically. same research,same matters, some things not on other dvds/vhs. it's worth renting first to check out. I have the vhs. Ok if your a tupac fan."
2,Too Many........,"Good footage of Pac with hair from Prison, BUT you will not learn or get anything about Pac from this Documentary. If you have seen Thug Angel and Before I Wake, that should complete your Tupac library. The parts of the script seems to be directly lifted from both Documentaries. You are really not going to miss anything with this one. It is not the worst I have every seen, but it is damn sure not one of the best.Signed Tupac Biggest Fan......"
2,Contains no actual works by Chaucer,"Um, I guess this is interesting if you're a scholar, but the poems are not actually in here. It's all scholarly apparatus about how to read middle English. This book should be sold under a different title."
1,bad judgement,"This product was much larger than the picture showed. Also, It only would have fit a man's finger. It was almost scary looking and not represented well on line."
4,A staple of classical music and a must have for any classical music collection,"Mendelssohn's 3rd and 4th symphonies, the ""Italian"" and the ""Scottish"" symphonies respectively, are some of his best symphonies and are staples of a classical music CD collection. While it isn't Karajan at the helm here, you really can't go wrong with the Berlin Philharmonic's performance, especially at this price. Recommended to anyone who has yet to add these symphonies to their collection."
3,"Excelente cartel, encomiable intención, pésimo resultado","***This movie IS NOT DUBBED in Spanish. It was originally filmed in Spanish.***Esta película no está doblada al español. Fue filmada en español.Melodrama sobreextendido. Pudo haber sido (y tengo entendido que fue) un gran cortometraje. De todos modos, vale la pena verla, siendo el único largometraje sobre los puertorriqueños en la guerra de Vietnam.This is an overextended melodrama. It could have been (and I believe it was) an excellent short. Nevertheless, it is worth watching, given that this is the only feature-length film about Puerto Ricans in Vietnam."
3,Ignorance,"Far from having an agenda, this is a thoughtful film. I resent the ignorant comment tying the movie to the independent movement in Puerto Rico, which by the way, means independence from the United Stated. Anyway, this film is about those who fight for a country that's not truly their own. It is based on a moment in our (and the world's) history that affected EVERYONE, not just those from one political party or another. True, film arts have a long way to go in Puerto Rico, but this is certainly NOT a movie about which we should be ashamed or that we should cast aside."
1,Clumsy pro-independence propaganda,"Even though The independence movement in Puerto Rico is small (5%)...they are dominant in the arts. So here you have a movie that uses the Vietnam war to push it's pro-independence , anti-american agenda.Aside from that , the movie is clumsily directed, badly acted and the dialogue is contrived, to say the least.All in all, a complete waste of time."
5,* * SHOUT IT OUT! THIS BOOK IS FOR REAL * *,I finished this book in less than a day. It sure does not leave anything at ALL to the imagination and lays the story out for all those who would care to read it! I also recommend PSEUDO COOL for another powerful and mostly different read about the lives of African Americans! Goines' novels are about the toughness of life--and this one presents it in no uncertain terms!
3,PIMPING BACK IN THE DAY,"This book shows the lifestyle as glamourous as it can be viewed. It was pretty similar to PIMP by Iceberg Slim both stories were about pimps cut from the same 'pimp or die' cloth. I will admit that I had a problem with his name throughout the whole book but I'm sure there is a reason for this title. It was quite a vicious cycle back in the 50s and 60s of hos breeding pimps and pimps breeding hos. Add a jail sentence or two, a couple of slick 'con' ideas, a diamond in the back, sunroof top and dig in the scene with a gangsta lean!!"
5,an amazing author is an understatement!,Man What can I say After the first 3 pages I was hooked The tell of a misguided youth that turned into a pimp. Yes he had some hardships and obsticals to over come but in the end he overcame them all.Mr goines Rep the D right.I close by saying Pimipin ain't for everyone.
2,Not what I expected!,"I have read two other books of goines ""Never Die Alone"" and ""Dopfiend"" both of which are totally out of my eliment but had me hooked to the unkown world the minute I started reading. Because I enjoyed them both so much I decided to try Whoreson which came highly recommended to me by my sister who got me started on Goines to begin with. I ordered the book and couldn't wait to get into it.It started out very interesting and got pretty mundane and predictable after some time. Needless to say I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as the others. I did push threw and finish it since I bought it and started it but certainly didnt' keep my interest like the other two."
5,Best Book I've ever read,"I don't like to read but my frat brother gave me this book and i read it in less than 3 days. Easy to read, very enjoyable and the best book I've ever read. Pick it up you will not be disappointed."
3,"Artful, Realistic, but degrading",This is another book by a great author. It is artfully written and I identified with it to a point. My problem with this book is that it harshly degrades pimps. Unfortunately I fear this book is based on real observations.
3,Solid work from Mr Haynes.,"Roy Haynes, a living legend of jazz, cut this trio album in 1960. It features Haynes at the drums, Richard Wyands on piano, and Eddie De Haas on bass. This is a good record of straight ahead jazz, there are no exceptional moments, but it is never boring or predictable. Wyands and De Haas are workmanlike in their efforts, Haynes drumming and soloing is characteristically powerful and lyrical (for drums). Overall this is simply a record that will appeal to fans of Haynes, or straight ahead jazz."
4,Nice British 1950's SciFi Flick,"Length:: 8:27 MinsThis video contains several clips from the 1954 British movie to show the quality of the dialogue, story, direction, and special effects. The film features characters with a bit more depth than usual for a 1950s alien invasion movie."
4,A BLAST from the past!!!!!,"This is the first time I have seen this move since it was on TV in the late 50s. Looking at it ""retro-spectively"" it was a joy to behold. It was 1959 and I was 9 years old again. I was surprised at how much of it I remembered. Don't be too critical on this film...remember the era and times in which it was produced."
3,"or 2.75, cool goyle frm mar","good enough alien, robot-uh, and spaceship and some fx i think, it kept me watchin pretty much in 1 sitting. almost unknown film"
4,Nearly perfect example of the genre!!,"That is, cheesy '50s sci-fi flicks featuring women in skimpy outfits. This has pretty much everything the disbelieving guy, the sexy alien who underestimates us earth folk, the other girl that also falls for the disbelieving guy; the older couple, and the kindly boss. Everythng, that is, except a logical plot, and who needs that? Buy this right now!!"
3,"A surreal, entertaining cheapie","A few years ago I stumbled across this gem on VHS -- what a delight! It does get off to a slow start (okay, it's pretty slow all the way through) but oh, my friends, when the devil girl arrives in her black leatherette costume, preening and bragging about her advanced civilization, and reveals her refrigerator-box robot! And all done so earnestly! A masterpiece of unintentional comedy."
3,Strictly for 50's-60's Sci Fi Buffs,It's a great film if you like that type of movie.It's particularly interesting because it's a British production and they seem to take their science fiction like everything else a little more seriuosly.But for me it's just plain fun and nostalgia.I used to watch this movie in the theater as a kid when it would scare me to death.But it's certainly not for any and everyone.But as I said in the beginning for the true science fiction lover it is a classic of the genre.
2,Great Sci-Fi British Camp Film,"I saw this film in the theater as a kid and never forgot it.As far as I'm concerned it's a classic and a must see for any sci-fi buff.It starts out a little slow in the beginning but once the ""Devil Girl"" makes the scene the movie really gets rolling.This movie in my opinion is grossly overlooked and should be ranked right up there with the original Godzilla and Forbidden Planet."
4,a thinker's movie,"I saw in the opening credits that this screenplay was originally a play. keeping that in mind i watched the movie thinking ""now how did they do this scene on stage?"" This attitude helped keep me amused.Perhaps because it once was a play, the characters spoke like people in a play--a lot more clever than in real-life.The premise of the story gets lost at times. Like when the ""devil girl"" marched the hero off to her ship I was saying to myself--""He's going to Mars to impregnate thousands of Martian women--tall statuesque women in black leather So what's the problem?"""
3,Devil Girl?,This is an old movie but was okay for a night just wasting time. It was an okay movie for the time in which it was done.
1,Grade c?,Just a simple pulp scifi from long ago. Didn't even finish watching it. I guess if you love old campy stuff you might like it??
1,"Great Movie, Pathetic DVD-R < Westlake","This is a great film, but this is the worst most pitiful grainy shaky out of focus DVD-R it's really unwatchable, and mine arrived completely scratched up swell"
5,"Another wierd item from Amazon,,,,","Amazon is great, I got this obscure little shifter knob cheaper than many catalogs AND I got it shipped free and received in two days. AWESOME!"
5,A must buy for principals!,"This book is a must for the beginning as well as for the veteran principal. Great words of wisdom, experience and quotations which will inspire all principals. Many ideas can be immediately put to use in any school setting. Every topic affecting teachers and students is addressed. Teachers need all the help they can get and this book offers a great menu of ideas!"
5,If you don't feed the teachers they eat the students,easy readinggreat pointsgreat formatappetizing sub-titlesEnjoyable way to gain adminstrative knowledgeWritten in a way that you want to reread it
2,"Just an Appetizer, Not a Full-Course Meal","Although the author had some useful suggestions, they were nothing that I have not heard before. The information in this book would be better suited to an ed journal article rather than 140 pages of the same recommendations repeated ad infinitum. As a veteran teacher, I found the format to be quite simplistic. Page after page of bulleted cliches and alliterative lists of how to motivate the faculty. Kind of demeaning to teachers, in my opinion. Do professionals really need ""Hug Coupons"" or ""Partnering with a Massage Therapist"" to be motivated to do their jobs?"
4,This book is a winner,This book gives the administrator and anyone who supports the teachers in a school some great things to think about and ways to help the teachers on a day to day basis.
5,absolutely wonderful,This book was definitely not only my style of philosophy but also writing. For a quick read for an aspiring administrator it was great. Could be a pick-me-up for an experienced administrator. Simplistic but great. I have shared exerpts with staff and students.
5,Must Have for ANYONE in Eduction,"This book is an excellent resource for anyone in the field of edcuation. It is fun and easy to read, plus there are specific strategies to use to keep both you and your students stress free. It will be an outstanding resource for me!"
3,NOT MY FAVORITE,"Although this product works okay, the fact it is a gel left my skin somewhat sticky. I had ordered Banana Boat LOTION and prefer it over the gel. Probably would not order the gel again."

4,Wow,"This book follows the destruction of Goddess worship in ancient Crete. How refreshing it is to see the past through a woman's eyes. The story is moving and sad, but well worth the read."
2,"Interesting concept, but...","The basic concept behind this book, that dinosaurs survived to the present and willfully evolved to be able to live among humans is original and clever, but the book focuses way to heavily on how they live as humans and ignores the story to a large extent until nearly the end when the author seems to suddenly realize he'll need to end the book and so everything comes together. Much too much time is spent buckling and unbuckling 'guises' and too little on the plot."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Dino meatsuit down and out PI disguise.No, really. In a humorous private investigator novel the main character is actually a dinosaur. Apparently they didn't die out and they live hidden among us, basically human sized.They stuff themselves into disguises, use scent etc. so no-one works it out.Once you can get past that basically Douglas Adams level of farce, you have a pretty fun book."
4,"Boy, THAT was weird!","I picked this book up because I thought that NOTHING could be as strange as this cover description sounded. Apparently, I was wrong. As an English teacher, I thought I'd read it all, but this is about a 9.5 on the odd-o-meter. A fun pastiche, guilty pleasure, and social commentary all in one!Take it to the pool and enjoy, enjoy."
2,Don't bother,"It seemed like a good idea, a ball to fetch/chew and ropes to chew and tug. After less then 10 minutes with this toy our 14 lb, 4 month old puppy had already tore off a piece of the rope that we had to fish out of his mouth to avoid him from swallowing it.The ends of the 'ropes' are sealed as if in a glue that comes off as the puppy chews. The rope then came apart in chunks. Not for a teething puppy!"
3,Heavy chewer destroyed ball in less than 20 minutes,"My dog, Jack, is not big on chewing the ropes, but managed to chew a huge hole in the ball within less than 20 minutes. He's a 6 yr old german shepherd/ lab mix. But he did love it though! Especially carrying it around by the ropes before he set down to chewing."
2,Ropes are easily destroyed and fray,"Please don't leave your dog alone with this toy if your dog is a chewer. After a few minutes, my dog had frayed the ends of all the ropes. This is the second (and final) purchase I will make of Stages products. They are overpriced, poorly thought out, , constructed from weak materials, and at worse...dangerousI am giving it 2 stars because at least the ball in the middle is durable."
3,almost made the cut,this dent puller is good but the baby dents it doesn't get out. i actually had gotten the pullet stuck on the car for a while. but it got out the huge dents i had.
1,Terrible,This thing didn't do anything. I had two small dents in my car and neither were affected by it. At least it didn't chip my paint or anything!
2,A waste,"It didn't work at all, the suction cup is too big, and it can only get suction on a flat surface. It probably won't do anything for dents smaller than a softball."
4,"Give it 12 - 15 tries, and it might work","So I got hit in a parking lot by an old man and saw the big dent in my car, but felt bad for him so I let him go. Dent was sizable, maybe the size of my hand or so. I bought this suction cup about 5 days later at my local autoparts store, and used it the first time.... nothing. I would finally get a suction (difficult on a curved surface) and get a good pull, then it would just pop off without the dent moving.I must have done that 12 or 15 times before finally...POP! 85% of my dent came out on that pull. After that, I still had a small dent dead center that I don't think I'm getting anytime soon. I will need something smaller, like Pops-A-Dent for that one. But in general, if you have the patience (and the finger strength!) then this may work for you."
1,Actually vix bits?,"It is not clear that these are vix bits. Vix is the name of a manufacturer that makes/made self-centering hinge bits. If you want made in USA products consider Starrett's self-centering hinge punch sold by Lee Valley and not currently available on Amazon. I think you need to be careful buying from people who are loose with words. If the bits are not made be Vix, they need to admit it. Vix bits are stamped with the name; if you want to make your own name, start with quality not copying. The quality of these bits could be better or worse, and a better or worse value, you can't tell by pictures and since they apparently are not made by Vix, you can't tell by name either."
2,Clasp keeps opening,I really like the bracelet but the clasp won't stay closed. I have lost is two times and have found it both times. I have worn copper bracelets for years and they really work for arthritis. I am very disappointed in the clasp and would like a solution for this problem. Help!
1,Too small...,This product advertised as 'one size fits all' was too small. I returned it and they send me another. Also too small.
2,Not satisfactory,The tape was in bad condition. Mainly the first part was very difficult to watch. I hope that I will be able ta rate better other tapes.Umbert
4,A must read for anybody considering a joint venture in China,"Bill Purves writes a clear and concise review of life in an old fashioned Chinese work unit. The real strength of the book lies in his descriptions of the lives of the Chinese workers of the factory. If you've ever been there and wondered why things happen the way they do, this book will go a long way towards answering your questions."
4,With a Twist,I truly liked it! It was a little different from other I have seen! Icame to ejoy the way it was presented and it had a little twist of difference when she looking for the boy she befriended. Many differnt travels than otheers I seen. It is a Keeper!
3,DIFFERENT VERSION FROM THE ONE I REMEMBER AS A GIRL,I bought this movie because my daughter was in a very controlling relationship. I tried to explain to her how the ice splinter got into the little boys eye and he fell under the Snow Queens spell. This is not the version I remember as a child. This one is long and drawn out. It somehow seems to lose the message. But I did find the other version and will be doing a review on that.Thanks Amazon
1,"Beautiful Imagery, but Incredibly Hokey!","The only thing good about this movie is how beautiful it LOOKS! It looks like a moving painting, but it is a disapointment with the acting! Fairy tales, at their best, are able to draw in both the young and the old, but this production failed to do that. I could see how childhood innocence was apart of the spirit of the movie, but there was something sooooooo cheesy about the acting, that I'm afraid only preschoolers would find no fault with this film!"
1,The Snow Queen,I'm glad we didn't pay much for this because it is really awful!! My kids didn't even manage to get through it one time...
3,dissapointing,"don't get me wrong, i love this band, DZ blew me away with Silent Night Fever, they sounded a lot like soilwork but much heavier and overall an awesome band. i was really excited to finally find This is Hell, and i bought it immediately. i must say that i'm not all blown away by it. i dont know how to touch my finger on it, but there are a few reasons. the melodies, while there are still plenty, they just arent nearly as memorable as they were on SNF, everything on this album seems toned down. the instruments aren't as loud and in your face, they're much more laid back, even the vocals seem a little soft at times. i have a hard time getting past #5 because most of the songs sound the same.i really want to like this cd, DZ have become one of my favorites, but i just can't get into it, i suggest you get Silent Night Fever first if you're new to DZ. i think its a matter of opinion, but i think that SNF is lightyears beyond TIH."
4,Excellent death metal!,"""This is Hell"" represents fast death metal with hints of thrash and melodic-black metal.The production is very good and guitar riffs are crushing and catchy in the same time. The drumming is mostly fast and a bit monotonous , but it fits the brutal riffs and screams they incorporate into the music.The only weak place is not enough guitar solos. In my opinion solos would bring more charm to their music. However track ""Amugdala"",for example, has brutal catchy riffs and they also incorporate cute guitar solo in the middle, which sounds perfect!But fans of swedish death metal bands, as well as American death metal bands should know about Dimension Zero !So, headbangers should know Dimension Zero!!!"
4,Works well,"Works as advertised. I do unplug when the unit goes into warming mode (as recommended by a couple of reviewers), and haven't had any problems with burning or drying out."
2,Okay,"This is a review for the 1st volume of the Samurai Champloo manga. It's starts out quite similar to the anime, but branches off from there.The stories are okay; they may seem too silly and outrageous. The complaint I have is the art. The art looks like it had been done either lazily or in a hurry. Most of the time the artist didn't care to use a straight edge to draw buildings, giving it a sloppy look.Also, the anime could incorporate music during the amazing fight scenes. The manga can just have numerous samurai getting their heads lopped off or getting cut in half.If you're a Champloo fan, you might want to pick it up, but if you don't you're not missing much. I'd stick with the anime."
4,Toddler toys,My daughter loves Dora and needed these toys to add to her collection. They fit perfectly in my wife's purse or diaper bag. That makes them easy to take anywhere to keep a 2 yr old occupied.
5,EXCELLENT,Great source of consistent learning for both of my children. They love learning and this series and method of learning is excellent. As a mother and teacher I would recommend SAXON to all.
3,Saxon Math,I would not say it is a bad book. It may be good book for 4thgrader. My daughter is in 5th grade and it is too easy for her. I bought this book thinking it would be a good book for my 5th grader daughter...
4,Great Service,I was very happy to receive this book as quickly as I did. I was able to help my daughter prepare for the CAT 6 more effectively at home.
2,A time to kill,"This is not a full sized book. It was a little more worn than what was noted. I did received it before the arrival date and I would order from this company again, but I will make sure the book is a regular sized book and not a book club sized book."
3,Digital at Montreux 1980,"I bought this record mainly after I heard it at an audio dealer. Dramatic direct recordings, but after a few times I got bored, so I gave it away to a friend of mine."
5,"If you like to dance, you will groove to Chgo Summer Stepper","The instrumentals on this album are fabulous. His style is utterly contemporary, urban jazz. Chicago's new style for the new millenium. Steppin cowboy is the favorite. The simplicity is what makes it appealing."
5,Had me off my feet and dancing!,"Loved the music! Especially liked the Steppin Cowboy with that Southwestern flair! The CD is a great collection of varying themes in the Steppers beat. Great to dance to, great to listen to anytime you need a lift. You're the best, Aaron! Record companies, pay heed!"
2,"Nice album, poor sound quality","Pulp's This is Hardcore is a great record. My review is not about the album, but about this vinyl pressing of Plain Records. The sound quality is awful; it does not have the sound quality you expect from any vinyl copy. It sounds compressed and you don't even notice that you are listening to it on a vinyl format. In my opinion, it's not worthy to get this copy other for the artwork that we all know it's great."
3,Not mint at all,"I'm really disappointed by the vinyl quality. Description says it is new, but i found one of the envelop teared and the record halted few times during listing.Of course, 'This is hardcore' is great and additional tracks on thee D-side are wonderful."
2,Came Bent,"I was excited to get this to put on the wall in my playroom for magnets for the kids. But the item came bent so i had to send it back. I know that what I wanted to use it for was not the intended use for this item, but I imagine it would need to not be bent for most usage."
4,Lovely and haunting,"I don't know much more about Francis than when I started reading this book--not a lot. So, if you are looking for information on him do not look here. However, if you are looking for a quick, lovely and haunting spiritual biography of anyone--look here first. The passages could apply to anyone on a spiritual quest. If you find yourself at a spiritual impasse, this is an amazing little book to give you an uncanny, introspective kickstart you are not likely to get anywhere else among the mainstream self-help offerings or other high-minded theology that are out there. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it lasted longer!"
4,Good & Evil in the Egyptian Alley East of Eden,"Not sure if I read the politically correct translation but I was impressed by this book. The story is very strikingly told as a simple and hauntingly familiar fable. Historical references are fused with a miasma of religious inferences that manage to seem both biblical, Pharoanic, historical and modern at the same time. We are smitten with the book's stark similarities to Old Testament religious texts. One is then reminded of the vast amount of fabled material each of today's religions has pilfered from the papyri of the Pharaohs.A good read in English, but it is a book you can put down and pick up without chagrin.I am sad to hear of the death of the Author and wish him a good rest in the Heaven of his choice."
3,Fascinating work marred by a sub-par translation,"Mahfouz weaves a really lovely parable of the three abrahamic religions and the rise of reason. And he does an excellent job of showing how violence, pain, and thuggery manage to adapt to any system of beliefs. The prose has this really serene, gently contemplative aura about it. That being said, the translation I read of this kind of sucks. A lot of the sentences have this klunky, often stilted quality, and the dialogue is riddled with very contemporary American colloquialisms, most of which seem completely out of place in an Arab language novel written in the 1950's about religious history. There are plenty of beautiful passages in it, but you have to grind your teeth on the messy bits to get to them. Try and find the older translation of it if you can"
4,"Enlightening, but not my favourite Mahfouz","""Children of the Alley"" is an elegant parable inspired by the histories of the prophets found within Egypt's monotheistic faiths. I liked this one, but found more enjoyment reading the Cairo trilogy."
4,Enough space for MacBook cables,"This pouch has enough space to carry my (late 2008) MacBook's power adapter and cables, two video adapters (DVI and VGA) and maybe a couple of thumb drives.Neoprene is fine and zipper and stitches seem durable."
3,a bit too big,"I got this to go with the cover for the macbook to keep the cords organized when I'm on the go. However, I think it is too big for the cables- but it can also hold your ipod in there as well. Since its too big, the contents move around too much."
2,Okay but annoying issue,"On paper this was the perfect thing for my purposes. A small cushioned case with 2 sections to put a small hard drive, cables, iphone and laptop chargers. Unfortunately it isn't really the best designed thing. The two mesh 'pouches' inside are very loose and as such anything you store in them tends to slip out into the middle crease of the folded case when you unzip and open it. Ideally there should be some sort of elastication of these mesh areas (especially the opening) to hold in whatever they contain. This probably wasn't done due to the case being very soft overall meaning any elastic would pull it into an odd shape when not full.Nice idea, poor design. It isn't a very complicated item so how difficult can it be to get this right?"
4,Very usefull,"This is an great idea, because you can potect the laptop, but if you dont look after the cables you're screw."
1,Bait & switch,"I ordered a branded product, Griptex, made in the USA. We've used the product for years and still have wrapping from some of it. The ad says, ""Griptex"" but what we got says ""wonderliner"", made in china. The name Griptex does not appear on the product or it's packaging. We consider this to be a bait & switch. Bad Amazon! This is the second time this kind of thing has happened. Some people don't mind sending their money to a communist country; we're not part of that crowd. Truth in advertising is essential in successful business."
4,"5 stars if polarized, but best shades for price","Having lost, stepped on, sat on, dropped, thrown, scratched the heck out of, and/or otherwise come to part with many, many pairs of sunglasses, I now have one rule: nothing over $100.Unfortunately, this doesn't leave many options between the mall kiosk knock-offs and the high-(over-)priced Maui Jims, et al. Fortunately, Wiley X fills that void quite nicely.The 120s have quality (ANSI-rated) glass, hinged temple pieces (another must for me), and great styling. Wiley X also makes a number of similarly-priced models with different shapes/lens colors. My one complaint is that they aren't polarized.I bought my first pair at an optometrist's and over-paid compared to on-line prices. In spite of that, I still think they're a great buy, and as soon as I finish this review, I will be buying (another) replacement pair."
3,Filler Galore,"This volume of Negima! has to be the weakest yet; hopefully the frequent mid-series slump won't last much past this set of four episodes. While there are a few cute happinings in the course of events, all would easily fall into the category of so much filler, as absolutely NO plot or character development occurrs. The closest to it is a rather amusing misunderstanding common in ""Harem"" anime, as to why Negi and Konoka are spending the day together - could it be a DATE? - which serves mainly to reenforce the setup between him and some of the other girls. Even the cute Yui, given prominence on the cover and title and menu pages, gets precious little in the way of actual screen time. The fanservice Ken Akamatsu's work is famous for somewhat reappears here in a satirical tale of duelling fanboy ""net"" sites, featuring an unlikely ""idol"". All are essentially stand-alone episodes that are mainly so much mindless fluff."
5,forgotten & Ignored American History,"Having grown up with a grandfather that still knew some of the language, I was additionally enlightened on reading this book.The theme of the depth of influence of Eastern woodland Indians on the American sub-culture in South has been severely neglected. So much of what is held to be Anglo or ""African"" factors seem more & more to be native. Food, words, family residential & migration patterns, attutudes of self-preservation & family loyalities all seem to be in part drawn form our mixed-blood heritage. Even with those who are unaware of it.excellent book."
5,"A ""must read"" for any serious ""social change activist""!","This book shares triumphs, as well as failures, in bringing about grassroots social change. It gives valuable incites into methods that work, as well as ones that don't. It is a historical document of the past 3-4 decades of ""the people"" bringing about change in society (or trying too). As a social change activist myself, it is very valuable tool!"
4,Great Box Set,I was very please with the item purchased. It was in great condition and was packaged in a way to avoid damage. I am very excited about receiving this item and I would recommend this dealer to others.Thanks
3,No bonus videos as printed on box and disc.,Well I enjoyed the Cd's but was disappointed because the bonus Videos and tracks that a to come with the set is not on the fourth disc as printed on the box and Cd. I call Amazon and they replace my set but still no bonus anything. Did anyone get what the paid for?
4,Great Box Set,"As a long-time hip hop fan and a budding jazz fan, this box set is a perfect melding of the two genres. This is the perfect soundtrack for a casual get-together of 30-somethings. Great chill music at a great price."
4,The Unwrapped Ultimate CD Collection Review,"I simply LOVE this 4 disc collection of music! It gives you a great, smooth blend of hiphop, R & B and jazz infused together. You get hours of bumpin' music ranging from artists like 50 Cents to Barry White!I played the CD's as background music for my 40th birthday party and everyone enjoyed it and wanted to know where I got it.It's also good music to play while driving on long road trips and when you want to kickback and unwind. If you're a music lover, you need to add the Unwrapped CD's to your collection."
5,Must have!!,Excellent! Ingenius mix of rap and jazz (my favorite genres). Must buy for all collections.........
4,Good,"Not what I expected, but I like this very much. Jazz and hip-hop is a winning combination. Could expand more, because there is more to hip-hop than 50cent."
5,So relaxing,"This CD is awesome. If you love and know hip-hop but at the same time enjoy jazz, then this cd is for you. All the songs are done so well, that you would think these were the original ones. The jazz is very relaxing and not overdone, so it's perfect to study or sleep to."
4,Unwrapped the ultimate box set -CD,"Worthwhile CD, entertaining and sets the mood I was looking for when purchased. Glad to have added this one to my collection"
4,Pretty good scandal,"I love TC books where a woman goes crazy with the shopping and then guns her husband down to cover it up before the bills can arrive. This book is so reminiscent of Barbara Stager who shot two different husbands to cover up her wild spending. Lee Orsini (or one of her other many pseudonyms) makes a perfect black widow. $20,000 at Nordstroms? A $1,000 per month mortgage? All this on her husband's $13,000 a year salary? Then there is the issue of the $40,000 she misplaced. I love how in these stories the femme fatale is never that good looking. This one is described with a weak chin and a huge behind. What is it about these women that keep successful men (a vet, a lawyer) coming back for more? Give me some of your secrets, girl!"
4,Understand the City,"Living in Little Rock, and being familiar with the underlying story, I have to admit that the author's depiction of both is (no pun intended) dead-on. Moreover, it adds depth to a chilling story. You come away from the read with a better understanding of Ms. Orsini--for better or for worse."
1,Cannot recommend,The blue tint made these bulbs dangerously dim on my 2003 BMW 530i. Don't know if it was the bulbs or my lamps. But I changed them out to the Silverstar Ultra by Sylvania and they are much better!
5,school resource,I purchased this book for homeschool learning at a high school level. I love Norton books. They are well written and provide a lot of information. The transaction with the seller was great.
4,longer version,"this book is packed with info.. it's the longer version of ""a brief history"" and how your prof. has so much info..that's not showing up in your shorter text (if you're getting the brief version) it has a lot of pics..and maps..and is easy to read.. very informative ..text book"
2,Started off great....then it broke.,"Ok, I'm going to start off with the GOOD things first...excellent amount of space for the price...radio on it...etc. Bad things...it stops working like 4 months into using it. Yeah, so this is my SECOND mp3 player this year...I'm actually thinking about getting a good ole' fashion disk player to save myself the money.Simply put, you get what you pay for."
4,Audivox MP6610FM 1GB - solid performer,"For the money and for it's size, this is a good value. I use it primarily hooked up to my car radio and I can listen either to music or to the spoken word. I was impressed with the sound quality, too."
1,used twice,not happy with this product. used it twice. went to add music and it completely froze up and would not work.
2,Langrishe a Bust,"This movie may be worth watching for its two stars, Judi Dench and Jeremy Irons. The story was slow and difficult to understand, though. Scenes appeared disconnected and the audience was given far too much responsibility to figure out the connection. I never did."
5,Still a hit at our house after 2 years,My 3 and 5 year old children are going into their second year listening to this gem. I'm glad it's a CD and not an LP because it would have been worn out long ago. The Dino Rock folks also perform live with puppets (mainly in the D.C. area) and are wonderful.
4,Dinomite musical,"Great variety of music styles and songs interspersed between dino facts. Great for my Pre-K schooler, who listens and sings to perfect synch after the 3rd go - around. Not bad for parents listening too. It is rather like a musical about dinosaur so do not expect music in every track (check sampler) but the whole CD creates a fun story for the kids to listen and learn. Some songs have fun with foreign accents, which may be hard for younger kids to understand all the lyrics. But is a great musical with a dinosaur theme."
5,Brilliant book about a brilliant man,"This is a book that really let you know Richard Nixon, one of the most fascinating politicans of this century. Stephen Ambrose's biography of president Nixon is the best of all the books I've read about this brilliant statesman. It's fair and it's written with a true feeling."
4,This true HIPHOP!!,"Remembrance of my teenage and early young adult years. Russell Simmons CD remind me that I miss the real true HIPHOP and the fun I and my friends had in the 80's. I recommend this CD to the NEW GENERATION that has been cheated from REAL hiphop music.It's not about profanity nor the cars and women! It's about life. Life in the hood. NEW GENERATION learn from your history, it defines your future."
4,Bayreuth Vicariously,"I tried to tell my husband it would be easier to start watching opera by Mozart or Bizet, but when we received Gotterdamerung as a gift he was hooked (surprise to me). I knew I'd have to get the whole set and start at the beginning. My mother & I used to see the Met. when it came to town in the spring. I grew to appreciate many types of opera, with Verdi and Wagner being my favorites. This is an interesting stage/costume setting; I'm getting used to it. The voices are spectacular and I appreciate information in the booklets and Bonus features. Well done."
3,Where eagles dare DVD,After playing the movie twice it would come to a spot about a third of the way in and stop playing. Cleaned the DVD player and the DVD and the same thing happens.
4,EXCITING,"A movie with adventure and excitement, it about an American officer who is held captive Germany. Burton and his team plan a rescue. This DVD edition is very clear for the visual part of it and not a bad sound mix. This is the digitally remastered edition. Clever cinematography and terrific acting by Burton and Eastwood. A must for any DVD collector."
5,Where Eagles Soar!,"I remember watching this movie on television back in 1970. At age nine I was just amazed. I couldn't wait to see it again and since VCR, DVD or Beta for that matter didn't exist, you'd have to wait til the programmers put it back on the air the following year and hope you caught it.This is simply one of the top 3 war movies of all time. I own both the VHS and DVD and the transfer to DVD is well done. The ""Making of"" video log is a wonderful little trek through the Austrian Alps describing the realism used to produce this masterpiece.Few movies have a life long affect on the movie goer. Where Eagles Dare is a must have for all movie fans and collectors because it has that affect."
3,I thought I was watching the Invisible Man,"As much as these guys snuck around in plain sight and nobody saw them, even when they weren't trying to blend in as German soldiers... It was OK for a rainy afternoon."
5,great digital version of a classic movie.,I have seen the VHS version of this movie many times as a kid and this was a great digital version. Our whole family was waiting for it to come and we had a great family movie night!
5,A Classic WWII Adventure,"Sure, it's fiction. Sure the scenario is absurd. Sure the action is all one sided. The only problem is that folks like me love those kinds of movies when the acting is good, there are plot twists, and the cast is top rate.Where Eagles Dare is one of the all time great WWII movies with a great sound track, especially at the beginning, and it delivers on high octane action from beginning to end. It is always great to see a younger Clint Eastwood paired with a veteran Richard Burton to remind us of what acting used to be like.From the initial parachute drop into enemy territory to the daring rescue by plane at the end, this film keeps you on the edge of your seat with some excellent videography in a stunningly visual landscape. The stunts are first rate if a bit over the top on believeabilty, but they do leave you with moist palms.No doubt real military veterans will laugh their way through this one, but keep it in perspective - it is all entertainment."
5,thanks i liked this item it is very useful to me and i plan to use it every day thanks,thanks i liked this item it is very useful to me and i plan to use it every day thanks
4,Great Movie for War Movie Buffs,Where Eagles Dare is a great action movie set during WWII. Quite suspenseful. I great addition to all War Movie Buff collections.
5,where eagles dare,Produce recieved was sent promptly and arrived in excellent condition.A welcome addition to my collection.
1,quit half way,"really bad video, chopped up picture and then sound.sound would work and then the picture would freeze.been a customer for years and the steaming video just doesn't work up to your normal standards"
4,where eagles dare,"this is a war time movie, set during world war two.actually this film is very adventurous and dangerous and quite disgusting the way they kill people in many points throughout , but at least the people being killed are nazis, and they are the enemy, and shown to be brutal killers themselves which may make it worthy.Music rated five stars to destroy the opposition at the start of the film.Film designed for the ultimate military attack on the castle.an experience like no other. Guaranteed to fascinate from the first scene."
4,Great Movie!,This is a classic war movie in every sense. Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood star as two commando's who parachute into a German castle to rescue a captured American General. Burton's sophisticated British manner and Eastwood's gruff American demeanor really play off one another throughout the movie. Not a movie with a lot of dialogue but that does not detract from the entertainment factor. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Simply watch it one time and you will agree this movie is great.
4,Blink and Youll Miss It,"From start to finish you will be on the edge of your seat in this WW2 thriller as Burton and Eastwood create havoc in one of the most nail biting WW2 flicks ever made.The location is breath taking, the plot suprising and the action plentiful.If you are going to make a fictional war movie this is the way you do it - Brilliant!"
3,Could this have taken any longer?,"I hope the DVD is cleaner than the VHS. I'll probably buy it anyway though, I just love this movie."
3,The Book is Better,"MacLean's amusing heroes, who killed maybe three people in the whole book, turn into grim-faced terminators here as things get way, way out of hand after a promising first hour. One might even think of this as the forerunner of all those Stallone and Schwarzenegger 1980's action pictures, because of the enormous bodycount and bulletproof heroes. I mean, if you know anything about submachine guns, you'd know the barrels would literally melt if you fired them that much. Even the producers thought the endless violence excessive, cutting a bridge-blowing sequence at the end for the initial release (later restored to the TV versions.) You almost start to feel sorry for the Germans and wonder if any of them can shoot straight. It is fun, but certainly no classic like Guns of Navarone. Read the book FIRST."
2,Where Eagles Dare,"Did not like this movie. It might have some juvenile appeal but certainly not for someone in touch with reality. lol,lol,lol!"
2,A rotten film that really is a lot of fun,"Where Eagles Dare is preposterous and stupid (like so many Aleister Maclean works), but it is a great deal of fun if you have a few beers and get into a light-headed mood. Burton is pretty good in his role, but Clint surprisingly doesn't register much. He just doesn't seem to play that well off of Burton. They are from two different words.On the positive side, Clint must kill more Germans in the last 45 minutes of this movie than Patton's entire Third Army did during the entire war. That and a memorable struggle aboard an aerial cable car are two reasons to watch this mindless festival of violence."
3,WHERE AGLES DARE on Blu-ray,Warner Bros. will celebrate Clint Eastwood's 80th birthday on May 31 by releasing a Blu-ray double feature of WHERE EAGLES DARE and KELLY'S HEROES on June 1. Both movies were directed by Brian Hutton.
4,Ditch the Chopper,"I loved this movie. It has commandoes, action, suspense, everything. I'm not very good at reviews unless I have a complaint. Here it is. The helicopter. It may not bother some people, but it bothers me, just because I take an interest in various types of aircraft. Anyone who knows anything about helicopters will recognize it as an American helicopter, not German, and totally wrong for the period. But that's the only mosquito on the camping trip. It's no reason not to pitch the tent. Buy the film, and enjoy!"
5,Where Eagles Dare 1968,"The mission is clear . Get in, Get the general , Get Out. Commandos charged with freeing a U.S. General from an Alpine fortress should also be told to trust nothing -including the search-and rescue orders just issued . Richard Burton (1925-1984) and Clint Eastwood (1930-) go WHERE EAGLES DARE and directed by Brian G. Hutton (1935- ) in this twisty World War II thriller written by Alistair MaClean (1922-1987). Film Music Composer Ron Goodwin (1925-2003) perform one of his best scores in this movie . Burton ventures into the realm of movie Pyrotechnics with Dynamic efficiency . And Eastwood cool-fire presence heightens one searing acrion sequence after another . The Film became Eastwoods then-largest hit and studio One moneymaker of the year . High Quality digital transfer . Recommended"
5,Excellent Movie.,I absolutely love every moment of this wonderful Movie. The acting is superb and the scenery spectacular. The story is also interesting and makes for a couple of very very enjoyable hours.
3,Great shootem up set in Austria,"A lot of fun to watch. Burton and Eastwood are superb. It has its flaws, none of our heros gets much more than a nick from all the bullets flying. The germans are like the gang that can't shoot straight and there are some errors, like an helicopter right out of 'whirly birds', a car scene that only kills the germans but leaves our heros intact and the notion of taking the bad guys back to England when it would have been so much easier to shoot em, but be that as it may its great fun to watch. The actors playing the germans make you believe that there was a castle of the eagles and the alpine corps is nearby, it is no more unrealistic than The Guns of Navarone. It has beautiful women. It is filled with wonderful subplots, exploding castles, a great bridge explosion scene and a lot of wrecked airplanes. It is well crafted and for me has stood the test of time"
2,"Good premise, terrible acting,","When I was a kid I thought I really liked this movie. But in today's standards and acting quality, the premise is good but I realize the acting and dialogue are just terrible. Why in the world is Richard Burton's face always clean and made up? Terrible acting, lack of expression especially the women. Too much left to the imagination. On a scale of 10, I would rate it a 3. Such a waste of resources considering the location of the film shooting. They should remake this movie."
4,Where Eagles Dare,Classic war movie with Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton how can it possibly suck.
3,a rollercoaster ride with highs and lows,"let's be objective. a great film in many respects, superb action sequences with glaring unforgivable errors. why on earth do the germans speak english with such an accent, it would have made a lot more sense to have had subtitles. Secondly, where on earth does a state of the art helicopter appear in WW2?!?. We need to redefine the patent for the helicopter, in fact i almost died laughing!. The most stupid thing was that they were chatting with each other and blowing off germans at random without needing to reload, i mean give me a break. If they were ninepins, WW2 would have been over just like that! The creators should have been more realistic. I also did'nt agree with the part where these two guys are on top of the cable car and make their way so smoothly into the castle without a single german lookout spotting them. But these deficencies apart, it's still a great film in many ways."
5,the baddest live group ever,"i've seen ewf in concert in person and it is a must to see.this group gives you so many styles and real good feelings it's incredible.i've seen many different artist live but bar none this is the ultimate group to see.and this video gives you a glimpse of what an ewf show is like.they are still the best though i miss Larry dunn,Al mckay,and the phoenix horns etc but they are still tight."
2,Cheap and worth it,"After reading the other reviews, I bought this CD. I wish I hadn't. The Franck D Minor is one of my favorite symphonies, but this is my least favorite recording of it. Muti seems to think that excessive dynamic variation (ranging from pppppp to fffff) is a substitute for emotional engagement. The performance is stiff and uninteresting. Franck needs to be performed romantically, not robotically.Oh well, at least it was inexpensive."
5,Excellent,"The CD was exactly what I wanted. It was shipped promptly and I received befor expected date. All in all, I am a very satisfied customer"
2,So-So,"Overall the movie had a bit of a cheesy quality, but the banter between Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson is pretty good. Don't go out of your way to rent this unless you are a diehard fan of either star. I went out of my way to see it simply because I can't resist the boyish, irresistable charm of Robert Downey Jr. In that respect, I wasn't disappointed."
4,Great Film,"Air America is funny action film about how the CIA and a secret war they were running out of Laos. Mel Gibson does a fantastic job in this film, like he does in any other film that he is in. Robert Downey Jr. does a terrific job as well. Truly a good movie. The soundtrack to this movie is good also."
4,Movieaholic,"This movie was pretty good. Seemed short and like the story line movied fast, but deff worth watching!"
4,don't bother me while im colorin!!!,"Air America was the United States ""airforce"" stationed in Laosduring the Vietnam war aiding our allies (amongst other things)Mel Gibson plays veteran air american Gene Ryback and Robert Downey plays Billy Covington the FNG to the outfit.(He ends up being recruited in the states by a fast talking agent of the CIA after he (Downey) is grounded for being an...in the air.The Film explores the adventures and antics..or hi-jinks as the pencil necked air america geek notes of t he pilots. Which includes drunken whorehouse parties, target practice with silencers on a miniature golf course and my favorite, gun running and landing an aircraft on a mountain.A serio-comic movie it delivers the goods and was is enjoyable to watchThumbs up^"
2,Monotone,"Great movie, unfortunatly it only plays in monotone not stereo Dolby like it says on the case. I played it on 3 different DVD players with the same result. Rather distracting."
2,Messy Air,"It starts off pretty well, then decides it doesn't want to be a Mash type of film but wants to be a big buddy buddy action flick. Yet it's not that either.It winds up being a mess of uninspired satire, that has Mel Gibson spouting off a series of trying too hard to be funny one liners .The story is about the CIA's secret drug smuggling for cooperation and arms in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war. It can never decide if it's just a glib buddy buddy action film or satire with an edge and winds up being a crass over-produced failure. Robert Downey Jr. is enjoyable for a while but no one is given anything resembling a real character to play. And the parade of stereotypical characters, ethnic insults and missed opportunities becomes numbing after a while.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder Available End of January 2001...."
3,Funny but uneven,"Mel is very good in this film about CIA guys doing illegal things while trying to enrich themselves.Definitely some good moments, but this movie is very uneven, meaning that every once in a while, I just crinkle my nose and grimace."
1,Ehh,Not the best movie. I am a movie fanatic and this played no high role in the cinema recommendations. Thanks.
3,Forget the 7.1,"I bought this to check out the 7.1 sound track. In reality, it's just 5.1 Picture quality is better than the DVD, but I thought the DVD had better sound quality."
4,Air America,"Great movie, the photography was excellent and the actors played believable rolls. I think the story line was true in many ways.I rate this as a must see for everyone late teens and older!"
5,Fantastic Blu-Ray Movie,"Seven dollar Blu-Ray movies motivated me to buy a Blu-Ray player and wow!!! I'm glad I did. Just wonderfull entertainment watching this movie in Blu-Ray and listening to the fabulous Blue-Ray enhanced sound track too. Lots of vivid explosive scenes and 7.1 sound. Even ""Tricky Dicky"" looked good. Go crank it up, you'll love it and laughs galore."
3,Hollywood - Not historical fact,"As a child I lived in Laos. My father worked for Continental Airways and I have a particular interest in this part of our history. Air America is entertaining but grossly misrepresents the drug situation. My father hates this movie. The drug focus is all wrong and misrepresents history. The public knows so little about the Secret War in Laos so it is a shame that the producers made the focus of the movie about profiteers and drugs. This was far from the truth. Air America does have a good special feature called ""Return Flight-revisiting Air America"" that discusses the controversy of the film. They discuss both view points on the drug issue. This is worth watching along with some of the other special feature segments."
3,Nice shots of Thailand - Uneven Story,"I have to admit that I bought this once on VHS, once on DVD and now on Blu-Ray, so I obviously feel compelled to keep buying it. I like the beginning of the movie as I find it is energetic with good mixes of action and sound. However about 1/2 way through, it starts bogging down. I frequently watch the first half and then stop before the second part.Although this film is supposed to take place in Laos, a lot of it was shot in Thailand looking at the street signs and the dress of the locals. It's most likely northern Thailand, but still nice to see all of the scenery. Also my Thai wife gets a laugh out of hearing Mel Gibson speak Thai to the monks and she has identified several actresses as being Thai as well as saying Mel's home is actually a known landmark.So I would say rent it first and if you like it, buy it later."
2,No big deal,"I ordered the wrong one - this one can only be written on the one side. Pay a little more and get one that you can write on both sides. The other side is just an ad and isn't even blank to use the dry erase marker on and if you do try to write on the other side, it smudges and won't come completely off.SO....spend a little more and get a double sided one."
2,not what i expected,"This clipboard is smaller than I had thought it would be. Either I didn't read the description well enough, or it was not what was published. Had to give it away."
5,Very Nice,"This is a nice clipboard. It is bigger then I thought it was, but I like it, erasers easy. Would recommend this to anyone!"
5,McLaren's Camp,"Bozanstven album koji vas vodi direktno u Paris.Jezz susrece pop-art. Velicanstveno.Omaz za Paris i svim velikim umetnicima. Da li treba napomenuti da na albumu gostuju i tri velika Francuska imena? O da, tu su Amina, Francoise Hardy i velicanstvena Catherine Deneuve u pesmi Paris, Paris.Remek delo!Obavezno za svaku ozbiljniju kolekciju"
1,*sigh*,That voice! Who can stand that lisp? The lyrics are so idiotic. Too bad the whole cd wasn't instrumental!
5,Oh la la!,"J'adore Cette disque! Tres Parisienne! This is by far one of the chic-est and most seductive CDs ever made. It's so effortlessly cool and stylish! And yes, la musique is amazing too! Mclaren puts the pop in jazz!"
4,Very nice women's watch.,"Very pretty watch, although the face was slightly smaller than I'd expected. Arrived in very timely fashion, in plenty of time for Christmas! Overall a good purchase, and certainly a good deal on a Skagen."
3,Almost enough,"If you can find the driver files to be able to use this item it works perfectly, good luck on finding the files!"
4,Live Prog Fusion Rock Jazz,"these guys were the bomb on college radio back in the day (late 70's early 80's) and this was the fuse. we played this record (that's right my young friends, record) all the time on the air along with Alan Holdsworth, Gong, Brand X, Bill Bruford, Tony Williams Lifetime, RTF, Happy the Man, etc. Incredible guitar hooks and great, intelligible and intelligent lyrics."
2,Poor printing,"The Publisher has reprint Thompson's classic The Land and the Book. However, the reprint is shorten version, including only Southern Palestain and Jerusalem. At least in my copy the printing is very poor, it lacks pages, one page is printed two times and the book is partly copied by dark pages hard to read. I most warmly recommend The Land and The Book by Thomson for all those who love their Bibles and love to study the culture behind it, but not this shorten reprinting."
3,Biased collection of Gloria's legacy,"This is a great collection of her Spanish material, but I must express my dissapointment in the fact that it is mostly her 3 solo tropical albums that are featured. There are only FIVE songs on this CD that are not from this CD.It would have been a great collection if they featured some of her early Miami Sound Machine hits like ""A Toda Maquina"" or even the Spanish versions of ""Conga"" and ""Words Get In The Way"". They didn't even include her huge duet with Alejandro Fernandez ""El Jardin"".It's still a good CD. But if you're a real fan, there's really nothing on this CD that will really stand out for you, only the fact that now ""Santo Santo"" and the Spanish version of ""Steal Your Heart"" (No Pretendo) is finally available on a Gloria CD."
2,Miami Sound Machine hits are missing...,"First Gloria's Hits with Miami Sound Machine are missing. I wonder why, considering they were recorded then with the same label.Which one's I miss here? Let's see...Otra Vez (1981): Me Enamoré, Sola, Haz Logrado Olvidar, Atiéndeme, Baila Conmigo, Quedemos Como Amigos.Rio (1982): Dingui-Li-Bangue, No Será Fácil, Yo Tambien Quiero Bailar, No Miraré, Tu Sabes Quererme.A Toda Máquina (1984): A Toda Máquina, Lucharé, Dr. Beat, Si Me Contaras, Que Triste Es Volver a Empezar.I hope someday we can enjoy this recordings in a CD format..."
3,Rating for the book,"As my review states, this rating has noithing to do with the writer. I would never say a thing about his brilliant works, which I admire and adore. I feel the book is low quality, and there is a lack of foot notes. I own other volumes of his works and I've never seen something as this before. Shocked yes I am."
5,A bargain at twice the price!,"Quite simply the greatest writer of all time, Shakespeare belongs on every bookshelf. I have this, and it is a treasure. For those of you who sweated through Shakespeare in high school, give it a try. You might be surprised by some of the stories you never knew. I would gladly have paid fifty bucks for one of these, and was thrilled to get it for twenty in hardcover. If you have kids, this is a must-have. If you don't, get it anyway. Although there are no footnotes, or any attempt to 'translate' King's English into American, I think these things are basically unnecessary. The sonnets also deserve a perusal, but I like the tragedies the best, particularly Julius Caesar and Titus Andronicus."
4,There are no words to describe Shakespear,"Shakespear was a brilliant playwrite. This perticular book's only flaw is the format in which it is written. But don't let that stop you! It is a wonderful book, but I would expect nothing less from a book with William Shakespear in it~"
1,Kindle edition does not fit description,"Bleak. No annotations, no notes, no commentary.No table of contents.Lines are not typeset as they are in the print edition.Characters identified in abbreviation.Prose lines and poetry lines set in center of page.Do not bother with kindle edition."
3,Book for Shelf - Not Terribly Accessible Shakespeare,"I originally bought this book used and later discovered that this was the ideal situation. It is handy to have all of Shakespeare's works (plays and sonnets) under one cover, but there are several drawbacks. Each page is split into two columns, causing the plays to be read like a newspaper. Since linebreaks are important in Shakespeare (remember the iambic pentameter), some lines are too long for the margins, causing the remaining words to hover like ghosts away from the sentence.Also, this book contains no footnotes. This is mainly how buying the individual play is superior to the collected works. Olde English isn't always intuitive, and this particular book leaves you to find out a word's meaning for yourself.But this book certainly looks pretty on your shelf. :)"
2,"Looks good on the shelf, but. . .","There are, obviously, pros and cons to buying any book. This edition of the complete works of Shakespeare is no different. Of course, Shakespeare is great no matter what the binding of the book looks like, but I would really hesitate to purchase a single book containing the complete works, if you're buying for everyday reading. I find that such large volumes are awkward, hard to hold and really thick. My personal collection of Shakespeare's works consists of single-work paperback volumes, not lovely to look at, but functional. Someday I hope to buy a set of the complete works in hardcover, but when I do, I'll look for a set, not a single book. However, if you're looking for the complete works in a compact package, this book is for you."
4,Customer service,"I was not happy witht he listing of the book I ordered being very good, I felt it should have been listed as good or OK condition. I emailed loopteck and Bob got back to me the following day. Though he could not change the condition of the book, he understood my not being happy and provided the proper customer service to compenesate. I was originally convinced that I would not order from this service again, but now I would consider ordering from them again.Thank you Bob for standing behind your product."
3,A good and cheap collection.,"The way that long lines end is a little confusing at first, and makes reading with a group somewhat awkward, but for the price this is a great book."
2,Extra-condensed and unnaproachable,"Brian Kendig's previous review says it all, but I wanted to add a caveat to a still-potential buyer: the text is so incredibly condensed that the endings of some of the longer lines are scrunched up in awkward brackets in the white space above, making for a disjointed reading of an already unapproachable edition. (Please read the previous review--it's quite helpful.)"
1,not as good as arden,"This book is empty and useless. If you want to read and understand what Shakespeare wrote buy the Arden Complete Shakespeare, it is much better.This book is a waste of money"
1,"Invest in Norton, not this","I was given this edition of Shakespeare for a Christmas one year when I was young. Once I began to appreciate Shakespeare, I did some readings in this work. It was okay.Then it became painfully obvious: with no line numbers, no margin space for notes, abridged names, no footnotes nor any research, it became rather difficult to closely study Shakespeare with this edition.That is when I purchased the Norton edition of Shakespeare. Although there are still abridged names, it has a very clear layout, notes, and enough margin to make anybody happy."
5,Terrific bargain,"I purchased this book for a dear friends birthday. It not only is a very attractive volume, it is a real bargain. All were very pleased"
4,Outstanding !!,"I have always wanted to read William Shakespeare but several of my friends who were English majors in college told me I was crazy. They even had trouble with it. I love it. I cant get enough. I read Hamlet first thing after I opened the package. I recommend it for anyone who wants to deversify and defy the tight boundry that people try to fit us all into. Buy...Its a ""must have."""
3,There are some problems about the book,"Well, the book contents are strictly what the cover tells, there are no kind of studies or comments about Shakespeare's works, you will find only the pure texts of each story.Other negative point of the book is its huge size, what makes the reading feasible probably only inside your house; and the tiny letters, what really handicaps the reading.If you are not going to read every Shakespeare's work don't buy this book, prefer another one."
1,Booo-ring!,"Hello Shakespeare, is anyone home? Most people will say that I didn't understand this, but I totally did and it still stinks. It cannot equal the feeling I got from reading abou Frodo and Sam climbing mount doom. And the fight scenes were totally unrealistic. I'm into suspending disbelief and all, but Hamlet? Hello? Like, a ghost living? Give me Mount Doom anyday."
1,Don't be fooled.,There are NO ANNOTATIONS - I wish Amazon would clean up its act and start posting accurate descriptions especially on the works of Shakespeare. WHERE ARE FOOTNOTED/ANNOTATED EDITIONS OF SHAKESPEARE FOR THE KINDLE??
3,An Excellent Text in a less than satisfactory format,"The Peter Alexander Text of the Complete Works of William Shakespeare is a great addition to any personaly library of the student of Shakespeare. However, the format is not satisfactory, with very limited margins and the typesetting is a bit small. This edition would be a great one if the format is improved."
4,"Has em all, high quality book.",Everything Shakespeaere is in here as far as I know. The pages and binding are high quality. Definite must have for any collection.
2,""" Betterness""",I think this book should be more about William Shakespeaere and have many more things about him i wasted a few minutes looking trying to figure out if this was a book about William Shakespeare ? When I started to read the inside i found out that this book is nothing but a book about his plays . i was very upset and sorry i had to write such a horriable book review .
2,too many words,Too many words for not enough pictures. As a teacher I would have it out for reading time..or on my shelf but it is definately not a read aloud book...I hate picture books with too many words!
1,Maybe Palumbo should kill himself,"I bought this record after reading Dave's review. I too long for the old Crack The Sky. The guitar lines, the expressiveness of Joe Macre's bass lines, right out front as part of the melody, and the drums and bass working almost as if they were one instrument...But unfortunately, those days are gone. I was really hoping this album would mark the return. But it did not. And after having been a huge early CTS fan, I can now conclude that John Palumbo is, and always has been the least interesting, and least skilled member of the band. Bring back the Safety in Numbers line up..."
5,Excellent book,"I purchased this book for my son (nearly 6) and liked it so much that I bought another copy for my nieces. This is not an in-depth book about any particular topic, but provides just enough detail to keep a kid interested and get them introduced to a huge array of scientific topics - ecological, biological, meteorological, geological, linguistic and too many more to mention! Friendly, casual tone, well written, and accurate."
3,Outstanding action on the high seas!,"Roger Moore in a good quality performance playing the exact oppisite of his james bond personna he plays a gruff navel hero(who despises women but loves cats!?)is out to stop a band of terroists who have taken over a supply ship. Anthony Perkins just relishs in the role as the leader of the terroist group, quite a departure from his infamous Norman Bates role in the ""PSYCHO"" Films. The original Die Hard if you ask me."
3,Fine Action Movie With A Great Performance From Moore,"This film took me off guard. Being a big Bond fan, I watched it only for Moore. Not only was this one of his best performances ever, this film was a damn good action movie. James Mason and Anthony Perkins add great support. How could you not like a guy who loves cats and hates women? Ffolkes is the man!"
2,Moore Shines in Mediocre Action Thriller,"Released as ""ffolkes"" outside the United Kingdom, ""North Sea Hijack"" (1979) provides Roger Moore with a surprisingly good character role. However, one wishes this action thriller was more effective. Director Andrew V. McLaglen cannot salvage a formulaic script and lackluster production values. The solid cast (including James Mason and Anthony Perkins) makes for an OK time-filler. McLaglen and Moore fared better with ""The Wild Geese"" (1978)."
2,Oil rig saboteur,"In ffolkes, Roger Moore plays a James Bond-type of role. He is the head of a specialized, anti-terror type group that is contracted by the British government to rescue a massive oil rig platform that is being held for a hefty, king's ransom. The head of the crew holding the platform for ransom, played by Anthony Perkins, is probably miscast. I still just see him as Tony Perkins from PSYCHO.A mild-adventure film directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, who did a superb job with Moore, Richard Burton and Richard Harris in THE WILD GEESE(A DEFINITE must-see and must-have for any video collection), ffolkes is a race against the clock for his crack underwater demolitions crew to find the explosives and then conduct their assault on the oil derrick before it gets blown to pieces. Moore's character as ffolkes does not like women or rewards or medals, but has a big fondness for cats."
4,"Good entertainment ""like ye good ole days.""","This movie is a small gem: great characters, unusual scenario, and a Roger Moore absolutely in top shape going against his classic debonaire role. The plot wants a group of no-good guys hijack an oil rig and to planet bombs on a second one... Heck, it doesn't really matter: just watch this movie for Roger Moore, Anthony Perkins and James Mason. You won't be disappointed."
1,Great film but a unviewable copy,"The VHS copy was less than 1/3 the quality of the copy I made from TV. It is a great film, but the copy being distributed must be a pirate copy."
4,A very underappreciated political-thriller,"This 1980 Roger Moore film shows that he could act outside of his James Bond persona. His role as the as Ffolkes --- leader of a band of private anti-terrorist firm --- is as anti-Bond as anything he has ever done. Anthony Perkin's as the main villain is adequate and sometimes his Norman Bates persona seeps through the facade, but not enough to distract.This film is all Roger Moore. His woman-bashing, cat-loving, cold-blooded, bearded anti-terrorist expert is one of the better characters I have seen on film. All the traits shown initially in Moore's character should make him unlikable, but in the end his character becomes the most intriguing and likable of the bunch. The scenes concerning the negotiations with the terrorists and the plan to retake the off-shore refineries is handle ably and there's not too much unnecessary plot threads to clutter the story. A very good film and very underappreciated as the years go by"
5,One of the best action adventures finally comes to DVD,"I first saw this movie on British television (under its overseas title of ""North Sea Hijack"") and it ranks for me personally as my favorite Roger Moore movie. When I learned it was finally going to make its way onto DVD I was ecstatic.In this fun action-adventure Roger Moore leads a commando team that must come to the rescue of two oil rigs in the North Sea and a Norwegian cargo vessel that have been targeted with booby trapped bombs. Playing very much against type Moore's eccentric character ""Ffolkes"" doesn't like women and instead enjoys the company of cats.The supporting cast of this movie is also extraordinary. James Mason plays a naval commander, David Hedison is the executive for the oil company and Anthony Perkins is the head of the terrorists. It is a tense, suspenseful adventure with the occassional light touch of humor and I highly recommend it."
2,cheaper video equals cheaper quality,"Always a favorite, albiet obscure, film for action lovers, Ffolkes delivers great action with the wit and charm of Roger Moore. Anthony Perkins is spectacular as a psychopath (no suprise here). Rated simply on the merits of content, Ffolkes is a five star film all the way! However, if you're wondering about the massive price differential between the two offered versions of the film, here is some insight. I purchased the less expensive version and recieved what amounted to a terrible quality pirated video. I expect you could get the same quality by setting up the camcorder in front of your TV."
3,Different Ffolks,"An edge of your seat thriller this is not. Something like a Bond film, though the ""Bond"" in this movie hates women, loves cats and is quirky but suave at the same time. I liked the character of Ffolks.Takes a while to get used to Anthony Perkins as anyone other than Norman Bates; but he does play a nut in this movie as well (granted a more rational minded one than in Psycho - he's sane enough to want a huge ransome in exchange for not blowing up an oil rig).The movie moves along at times, though often, has the feeling of different parts being quickly taped together, like in most low budget films. Ffolks is a low budget film, not terrible, though three stars is probably being generous."
2,One of the worst moderately high budget movies ever,"I am not in the habit of giving bad reviews, but this one deserves it. Watching the movie made me wonder if Roger Moore was going to actually say ""I'm only doing this for the money"".There are better action movies, better thrillers, and better political commentaries.Catch this some late night on an obscure cable channel, save your money."
2,edited version,I remember this movie from the early '80's and loved it them. The edition which I received was an edited version and was not as good as I remember.
5,Great story,Fun and lots of action. Remember this was made years ago and it even a better movie now. so Get it
4,An entertaining thriller,"Roger Moore stars here as an unofficial Scots marine commando (Rufus Escalibur Ffolkes) who trains an elite squad of half-a-dozen other ex-servicemen to combat underwater terrorism, should the need arise - and it does! Anthony Perkins (as Kramer) leads a team of villains to hijack a North Sea oil rig for a 25 million ransom. David Hedison is the captain of the oil rig. James Mason stars as Admiral Brindsen, the navy's man on the scene and Faith Brook is our decisive lady Prime Minister. The story was written by Jack Davies; Elliott Kasner was the Producer, and Andrew V. McLaglen the Director of the movie. It's a gripping thriller, though it would have been even more exciting with some of the stunts we have now become used to in James Bond movies."
1,super sonic speedway,"This is the worst thing i have ever bought, they should be paying people to take these off their hands, or better yet recycle some to make trashcans so you can throw the rest of them away. I am very unhappy with the quality of this ""toy"" and i use the word toy loosley , because all its good for is to push the cars around the track by hand using the mechanism to pust the cars around dosnt work well at all, your lucky if you can even get the cars started.I can believe you would actally even seel souch a piece of ... let alone put you name on it. I will return this ""toy"" and for their sake i hope they dont ask whats wrong with it............."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Made the mistake of buying this set from Toysrus as they were out of complete race tracks other than this one. It is powered by a catapult type system that I had trouble with, much less my five year old and three year old. Why is it so hard just to find a Hot Wheels race track that is powered by a battery and makes the cars go around the track. This thing is a waste of money and my kids were discouraged in about two minutes. I tried a little longer to make it work properly but gave up. It will be going back to the store."
5,Hip Hop Brilliance,"X-CLAN represents a height in hip hop. In their music they created worlds, mythologies, languages. I cannot think of another artist in the genre who's voice is so much like a musical instrument as that of Brother J. His poetry, the way he rides the rhythm, the power in his inflections are unparalleled in hip hop. I heard about this record when it came out but only recently purchased a used copy. I cannot overstate the mind boggling genius of this album. The beats here are sicker than ANYTHING you've heard on the radio today or even in the past decade. The rhymes Brother J. slams you with are like pyramids compared to the house-of-cards disposability of todays so called ""talents."" If you are a true hip hop lover, and not just some trend-following, party-music lovin' dope head, I cannot recommend the DARK SUN RIDERS enough. This record was made over ten years ago, but I swear to you, nothing can touch this. Come diddy dum...It's time to build!"
5,Great resource. Basic but very Useful.,"Excellent resource for all ASP.NET AND C# beginners. as well as a quick reference for C# and some ASP.NET basic configuration. These guys did a great job in putting together a logical sequence of chapters that will help the reader successfully learn to code basic ASP.NET web pages using C#. I especially like the general overview of the C# language and Object Oriented programming.Know what you are buying, because some readers commented it was ""A bit too basic"" and that is probably a technically correct statement however relative to your level of expectation.I used it to first phase into ASP.NET for which it was extremely helpful. Later in the development cycle of my initial application the book lost its use but I keep coming back to it for quick reference.A must for anyone coming from a classic ASP development environment into ASP.NET, C# and Object Oriented Programming. Worth every penny."
3,A bit too basic...,"Excellent book for a beginner, but I think this book has a big focus on ""never touched a computer"" type beginner. If you are a tad familiar with what IIS is and the concept of a web server, you will need to skip about 100 pages. It is a good book for an intermediate programmer, since this book does cover all the bases of what you should know about ASP.NET. What I didn't like about this book is that it gives a basic explaination, but never builds it up to something difficult. It explains something basic and keeps the example basic. It should build up to examples that are a little more real world and difficult. If you are a newbie however, I would give this book 5 stars. But, I think most ""beginners"" have some idea with what this web stuff is all about."
5,Teatime in the Northwest,"Sharon and Ken Foster-Lewis do a wonderful job describing the atmosphere, decor and foods at various tea establishments within Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and even Hawaii. Their write-ups on each tea room are so thorough that you will be able to determine where to partake in the delights of sipping tea and tasting treats. ""Teatime in the Northwest"" goes beyond just listing tea rooms in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, it gives some tea history, describes various types of tea and most importantly, how to prepare the perfect cup of tea. Approximately 100 pages of the book are filled with mouthwatering recipes for tea sandwiches, scones, biscuits, breads, cookies, cakes, tarts and so on. Scattered throughout the book are whimsical or tranquil quotes from famous people sharing their teatime experiences. I'm looking forward to Ken and Sharon's newest edition of ""Teatime in the Northwest"" which I hear is currently in print and will be available soon."
3,At Least This Edition Made Sense,"This review concerns the revised 1964 edition. Mr. Hardy gets Frank and Joe to help him track down a gang of jewel thieves. The trail leads Frank and Joe to the old Perth mansion on the outskirts of Bayport and into another mystery: what caused the death of Clarence Perth, who died in the mansion shortly after inheriting it from his uncle. This book wasn't bad, but with its appealing title and spooky mansion, I expected it to be better than what it was; although, most often, the books with the very appealing sounding titles don't live up to my expectations. This book is average; the mystery is interesting enough, there is a moderate amount of action and at least this edition wasn't confusing, unlike the original edition which was hard to follow at times. Some fans, like myself, might feel that this book wasn't as good as they had expected, but I don't think that any Hardy Boys fans would be bored reading the book."
5,Use on your face,"Great smell and the tingle is cool. It makes hair soft, but seems to strip too much oil out, though my hair is never oily (even after camping for a week). I only use it as shampoo twice a week.Five stars for use on skin, though. I used Nuetregena (sp?) before and it was ok. The shampoo calmed my face down the first time I used it though. Acne is now gone completly. Don't pick though, acne looks more ready to leave but it will go away without your help (that's gross anyway).Maybe I've got unique skin, but my wife tried it too, and we're frankly shocked. She had some acne from newly cut bangs, but it's gone. It is almost a miracle facewash (for us two anyway). If it goes off the market, I think we'll stockpile it."
4,Automatic Watch Rewinder,Excellent. Gentle with even the most expensive watches. Very easy to load and unload.
2,Inexpensive but be careful,"The previous reviews are all correct. Inexpensive, silent and easy to load watches. However, I have had this unit overwind two watches. These are $200 Japan automatic movements so I wasn't very happy. Might be better on a swiss movement, but why would you want to risk a more expensive watch on this winder."
3,Work nice when it work,It works good for about a month and now the top has stop working...So now I can only put 1 watch in
4,Great,"Keeps my watch on time. A little loud when winding watches, but okay . Price was good for the item"
2,"Good while it works, bot not long enough even for the price","I bought this product a little over six months ago and it worked great until 3 weeks ago. I tried to contact the seller about a fix or replacement and have heard nothing from them leading me to write this review. The product is good while it lasts, but the failure in about half a year combined with poor customer service lead me to rate this product with 2 stars."
5,well worth the money,winder is well worth the money. You can spend a lot more money and get a lot less. Reasonably quiet. Good way to keep watches wound. It seems to work very well. I will buy another one as I get more watches.
4,My first winder,"I was hesitant to order such a low price winder, after seeing much more expensive items around...This winder is cool looking, it fits two large case size watches (42- 46mm with thick rubber bands). It is quiet, and in 4 weeks of use, so far, my two automatics are still keeping time correctly, with the programmable winding set for 30 minutes every 3 hours. I can see buying another as soon as I find another 2 automatics I want."
1,Unreliable,"The first one didn't work when I received it & the replacement worked about 8 weeks & then quit. On top of that, I had to pay the return shipping for the replacement. Too cheaply made!Tom"
2,new multi setting smart ic timer,"loved how quiet it runs, have one double the price and twice the noise! only one problem, the bottom turn table stopped within the first week!! yet the top turn table kept working. contacted amazon and they secured a return. only problem cost $11.00 to return. seems the quality control needs improving!"
3,Not unreasonable for the price paid,"Plasticky, but robust. Does becomes noisy at times. Intermittent. But at the price, what can you complain about ? <grin>"
4,A great buy !,"I searched for a low cost watch winder as I have a number of automatic watch's and I wanted a winder that did not go all the time. This one works for an hour and rests for three which is great. It is value for money but I had to by a voltage converter for Australian use but I knew that before purchasing.It has been used continously and I am pleased, however it has become a bit noisy and ""clunks"" a lot as the watch in one bay revoves. It does even when no watch's are in the winder. I find that dissapointing. But compered to a lot of winders for sale this one has value."
4,Watch Winder,The winder works well with my Tissot watch. The only complaint I have is that it is kind of loud when I am in bed. I turn it off before I go to bed and cut it back on when I get up in the morning. It doesn't hurt the effectiveness of the winder. You can't beat the price either.
2,Not for your bedroom,I am not a watch collector but have some atomatic watches. I've been shopping for reasonably priced watch winders for months.I purchased this product. It was very cheap so I had to try.Two major major problems.1. Too noisy. I had to turn it off at night. Maybe I am too sensitive?2. one hour winding is not enouh. my watchs' power reserve level goes down little by little.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
1,Not worth 2 cents,"This item did not keep my Breitling automatic watch from stopping. It was also NOT silent, as a matter of fact it is noisy.You get what you pay for."
1,"Quits after two months, manufacturer does not respond to emails for help","I'm really disappointed by this product and the manufacturer.The top winder of the device quit after two months of ownership. Garinin does not respond to my emails for support.I disassembled the device to determine what's wrong and possibly repair it myself. It turns out the gears are cheap plastic and deteriorate rapidly. Yes, this is the ""new improved"" model I bought.For as long as I have it, I found that the winder DOES NOT increase the charge of a SEIKO KINETIC, probably because it runs too slow (about 4 RPM). It does fine at keeping a mechanical automatic ticking, but it doesn't provide enough energy to a electric Kinetic even at the highest setting.I highly recommend looking at another manufacturer."
2,Works - But - Noisy,This device works but it is very noisy. The part that secures the watch to the system is not well designed. If all you need is a device for keeping your watch wound then this machine does the job and the price is right.
4,Just received and one problem noted,"Compared to the price for any other auto-winder, if it works at all it is a bargain. The description notes size adjustment. Actually there are two different sized blocks the watchband wraps around. These just pull straight up and off to get at the smaller version. No instructions to tell you this. The watch itself is intended to fit into a recess which is about 33mm long. My watch is 38mm diameter and thus will not fit into the device as it is designed. It is working with a bit of fiddling and with the cover left open.The operational problems others have noted I would guess are related to individual variance and typical Chineese quality control. Those problems would probably be there for the similar but much more expensive auto-winders, unless they come from Europe or are backed by an expensive Swiss watch brand.April 25, 2011. Now it is years later and it still works just fine. I leave it plugged in and running about two days a weeks."
2,not for kinetic,Double Automatic Vertical Watch Winder Box with Built in Multi Setting Smart IC Timer Will not wind automatic kinetic watches. Restocking fee and shipping charges make it impractical to return. This nonfunction for kinetic automatics not listed in item's description.
4,Sleek and Stylish,"Nicely designed, works well. The plastic fittings do not quite fit the feel of fine watches, but what the heck!"
1,watch winder,"Very cheaply made. Subpar quality. The one I received did not work properly. Also, it took numerous emails and calls and approx. 1 month to get a refund. DO NOT PURCHASE."
5,Outstanding auto winder...,"This Garinin autowinder does exactly what it is supposed to do. Keeps both my autos running and ready for use. It is quiet, smooth, and looks pretty good sitting atop my computer desk. It has a variety of settings that will meet the needs of almost any auto watch on the market. It is well built, and works as described."
1,Watch Winder,This watch winder only worked one day and has not worked since - I do not recommend at all.
1,Temporary solution,"My boyfriend purchased this to house his two nice watches (one Tag and one B&M;). It worked fine, was a little noisy, but kept his watches in order. The unit died about seven months in... I'm looking for a replacement now.At best, a temporary solution. I would recommend spending more to get a better product."
4,Auto watch winder,"The product was shipped quickly and well packaged. Instructions are simple and since connecting and placing my watches in the winder the winder has worked very well. It is fairly quiet ( a slight hum) and and relieves the burden of resetting my automatic watches. Only complaint is that the power cord is a bit short, if you want to place it on high dresser you will need an extension. I would recommend this product."
4,"Resonable price , silent motor","Has been using it for few weeks, so far so good. Am really surprised this winder's motor silent performance. Will consider buying another in future if it works well. It will be best to include a 220-240V AC adapter for Asia countries usage. Or, provide the consumer with a choice to select either 110 or 220-240 AC adapter."
1,But it should wind the watchs too!,"I did recieve my watch winder in perfect condition!. Loaded my two automatics in it. Its been 2 days and the winder does work...starting and stopping as per the timer and it operates silently too! However, it does not wind! Both my watches, an Omega men's Speedmaster and a women's Constellation...have now stopped after sitting in it for 2 days!As far as I am concerned the product does not meet its purpose."
1,Save your money,"I had this winder for approximately one month before it died completely. It's made in China and it's not even UL listed, which is something you should consider if you leave it plugged-in when you are not home."
2,good value,"THE PRODUCT TOOK 8 DAYS TO DELIVER,(A LITTLE LONG, I THOUGHT) PRODUCT WAS PACKED CORRECTLY AND ARRIVED INTACK. THREE PROBLEMS FOR ME. ONE, THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONS AND IT TOOK ME A LITTLE WHILE TO POSITION WATCH, TWO WATCH IS A HEAVY ROLEX-TYPE AND MOVED AROUND WHILE THE MACHINE IS IN OPERATION ( A LITTLE FOAM UNDER WATCH, FIXED THIS PROBLEM) AND FINALLY, THE DAMM THING IS NOSEY BUT OTHER THEN THAT IT WORKS CORRECLTY WITH 1 HOUR IN OPERATION, AND 3 HR AT REST. AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE PRICE, ALL IN ALL A GOOD VALUE."
3,Good for the money,The watch winder is adequate but probably won't last over a year due to past experience with this type. Good construction but the belts look like rubber bands.
1,Didn't work,Product didn't work...no reply from the seller (AA store) on returning it. It looks like it may have been nice though...
1,New and Improved!!,I don't understand they said this was a new and improved product. Well it quit work after about a month. I wanted to contact the seller but have not had time to.
3,Did I buy a grinder?,"It started out just fine. It was very quiet at first, but after 3 weeks has started to make a slight grinding noise when running. Not sure what the noise is but I'm sure I would rather not have it.The winder mount is spring loaded so that it will push against the band and hold the watch tight, but for bands 8.5"" and larger it will not hold without adding some padding between the mount and watch. It simply doesn't push out far enough to hold such a large band tight.I can live with it as long as it doesn't strip a gear. I need to find out what the noise is and get that fixed."
3,It works very reliably,"Overall, I am pretty happy with this unit because it works reliably. I tried one other brand of watch winder and it did not work as it was supposed to. This Tech Swiss unit will wind your watch and not overwind it.There are two things I do not like about this unit. First, it is big. I would have liked it if they managed to make it a bit smaller. Secondly, the insert that you attach the watch band around has a very powerful spring. I managed to actually damage the band on my Seiko watch while fiddling with it. I now know how to do it without causing this damage, but a kinder, gentler insert spring would have prevented my klutziness from allowing this to happen. (The watch was easily and cheaply repaired.)Overall, this is a good unit, especially for the money, but be careful when you work that spring."
1,I would not buy it again,"At first, I thought this was a pretty good deal. I figured I could tolerate the somewhat cheap, plastic appearance because of the favorable price. However, the winder lasted only six months before dying. At a rate of two per year, the price starts to look a lot less favorable!"
5,Great Product and great value,For the money this product works great. I have a Stauer in it right now and for about a month it has kept perfect time. It looks contemporary and not as sophisticated as the wooden ones but in serves the purpose. If I ever need another winder I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.
1,watchwinder,"I bought this to save time. It does not spin long enough to keep the watchs to keep accurate time after 3 days. After three days the watches require you to reset them. This was the case with two different watches from two different companies. It was supposed to save me time and in the long run it does not. So, it is worthless."
1,POOR QUALITY WATCH WINDER,"Received this unit in nonworking condition. Had been already sent to another buyer, and had been returned with a note saying (Doesn't Work!). It was then sent to me. I've sent two emails with no response from either the seller or Amazon. Have filed for a nonpayment claim with Master Card. My Advice--don't buy this watch winder!"
2,Works well.. but not for long,"I have owned two of these winders, formerly under the name SwissTech or TechSwiss or something like that. Like most cheapskates, I bought them because of the price. Both worked well for about six months and then they up and died. I will not buy another. My wife says bite the bullet and buy a more expensive and therefore (???) reliable one. But which one?!"
1,DoD - Dead on Delivery,"Unit looks good ""thus 1 Star"". However it was DoD! emailed 6/23/08 WATCHPAVILION for RMA. Will see how this RMA process goes... Second review awaiting...Second Review: WATCHPAVILION responded (same day) will ship out new unit. 3 star rating.Third review awaiting..."
3,Good Economy Wider,"I've had this winder for a few weeks now and so far I am pleased with it's operation. It is very quiet, and the four (4) timing adjustments will keep most automatics running properly. Make no mistake, it is all plastic, and if you get a couple of years out of it, count yourself lucky. The watch holding system is OK, but again, it is plastic and does not scream ""quality"". It takes up very little desk space, and seems to work properly.Would I keep my high end automatics in it? So far, no. I'm testing it on a few SEIKO's, etc. and keeping track of the winder performance. One plus besides the very quiet operation is the very low RPM of the winder. Mine runs at 6 RPM, which is nice and gentle.For the price I paid, this is a good deal. It is not an ORBITA winder by any stretch, but again, in this price range, you could do a lot worse."
2,Tree Spirit Salt & Herb Box w/Lid,"The wood is very dry, even after applying oil treatment it was rough on the hands. Also the magnet that keeps the lid in place is constantly falling out of position."
2,SMALL,"Purchased this box from my daughters Amazon Wish List, so I have no one but myself to blame. It is so small that not much salt can be stored. She was happy with receiving this item but would not buy again."
4,Great MMO Game if you have the setup,"This game is better than the first, I've been in the beta for just under a week now and love the game a lot. It's really easy to get into and the graphics look amazing even on balanced settings.I look forward to this game should be great. Don't listen to the WoW fanboys this game is going to be just as good as the last. Don't get me wrong WoW is a good game too, I was in the stress test for that. Sadly I won't be picking it up because I already have a subscription to SWG and I just couldn't get into WoW until the very end of the stress test"
5,You have to understand,"You have to understandf that SoE has come a LONG way from the begining. EQ 2 looks amazing and after all the beta reveiw I have to take the players word for it, Qoute ""If you liked EQ you will love EQ 2, if you hated EQ you will still love EQ 2"" This game is going to be a huge hit and will lead to other competition between other games. Besides I am sure that we have all wasted away 50 bucks before why not try it and if it doesnt work out then O Well."
4,Pricey but quality,"I've been playing MMORPGs (beta and released games) for over 5 years now, and I keep coming back to Sony Online Entertainment games. Both EverQuest and it seems now EverQuest II have staying power with me. I am finding the graphics and complexity of the world in EQ2 amazing, sometimes breathtaking. I will definitely find it hard deciding how to divide my game time between the two.The Collector's Edition adds things that chiefly make you have a nicer ""home"" in game. The art book is nice to look at, but not full-sized like most collectable art books tend to be. The other items found inside the box also tend to be things you'll look at once or twice and then put away in a drawer. If you can do without owning a baby dragon, which just is something cute inside your house, you can get by with a standard edition (DVD or CD-ROM)."
5,Amazing,Been in Beta from Day one. This game is amazing. I dont see how anyone could not like it. It does require a decent system but not overboard. 5 stars and if I could give it more I would. Buy the game you will love it. Also ... EVERQUEST 2 5 stars ++++++
3,Very slow,"The grafics are really good but the game is a little bit slow how the move and how the game goes, I really didn't like the game, you spect more of the game but you get dissapointed when you play it."
3,older publishment,This book does have some good information in it but it was published in 1998. If I had known that I would have looked for a more recent publicatioin.
1,Bad News,"At one time I had ALL of ""Hammond's"" lp's on Prestige, New Jazz and Riverside. They were the best collection of jazz organists anywhere bar none. I picked up this album and it really sucked. It is the only ""Hammond"" album I ever tossed in the garbage can."
1,at least its last one.,"Yes, I bought this flick because of other named ""La Marge""--what a huge gap. Title is misleading as word love could be interpreted in numerous ways and in this opus the producer just put together pieces to make something. I have to admit we see Paris, streets, subway and people at specific moments but so what. I need movie, ideas, imagination and if title says love give me love. Some skin but no private parts, female actors below average looking.For no reason I remember ""Seven beauties"" where females are really ugly but it didnt stop me from considering said movie to be best.Avoid."
2,why did i buy it,"make sure you have an air pump that works on this product before you buy it. this sofa may be okay for makeshift use, but not for permanent. isnt perfectly balanced or comfortable. in fact i dont use mine anymore because there was a hole (a puncture) in the seat, in one corner, so that it is difficult to patch with duct tape. i remember the sofa used to tip slightly forward when i sat on it, so wasnt perfect. but it looks pretty decent when you're not sitting on it."
1,"Book is terrible, movie is great","I watched the movie Talk of Angels several times before I knew that it was based on a book. I watched it primarily because I think that Polly Walker is a great actress, but then I got hooked on the story. The story in the movie involves the historical context (precursor to the Spanish civil war) and better explains the characters' motivations. The book is lacking this context and reads like a cheap romance novel at times. I was very disappointed."
3,"INGMAR BERGMAN, OPUS 4","*** 1948. Based on a novel by Dagmar Edqvist, this film was written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. A blind pianist tries to find his place in the society but loses little by little his social rank by accepting cheap jobs. A former peasant girl who managed to get educated through hard work will help him to give up the idea of suicide. One of Bergman's first efforts that could appeal to Bergman's completists or to curious ones. Some scenes like the initial dream of the pianist, filled with symbols, or Mai Zetterling's performance were a sufficient reward for me. If you try hard enough, you'll be able to find a zone 2 DVD of this film, titled MUSIC IN DARKNESS, released by U.K. based Tartan Video. The copy is superb, the sound rather bad. With English subtitles."
1,Night Is My Future,"Another melodrama, which seemed to be a typical requirement of the era. It's too sweet at times, too artificially tragic and too non-believable, all leading to a happy-end. Still a ""watchable"" film, but one won't miss much by skipping it. For completists only."
1,NIGHT IS MY FUTURE,"I HAVE RETURNED THIS OVER A WEEK AGO. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS THE ORINGINAL JANUS FILMS RELEASE IN VHS, BUT THIS IS A KNOCK OFF VERY POOR, EXTEMELY POOR COPY MADE FROM WHAT LOOKS LIKE POINTING A CONSMER VHS CAMERA AT A SCREEN USING AN OLD 16MM PRINT OF SUCH VERY POOR QUALITY THAT IT IS HAD TO SEE THAT IS WHY IT WAS RETURNED FOR FULL REFUND. IF FOR SOME REASON THAT THE REFUND DOES NOT COME I WILL MAKE A CLAIM WITH MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY. DENNIS PIES"
2,beyond evil,"A friend told me about this movie and sugested I watch it ,but in all honesty I didnt enjoy the movie what so everdidnt find it any good :("
1,Beyond stupid.,"Beyond Evil (Herb Freed, 1980)Wow-- what a thoroughly awful movie this is. It's got some interesting ideas, but they are completely buried under an awful script, bad acting, and some of the worst special effects imaginable-- this is another of those no-budget Z-grade pics where green beams actually shoot out of the bad guy's eyes. Yes, literally. It should be some sort of rule that green beams shooting out of the bad guy's eyes means you're guaranteed an awful movie. On top of that, you can pile bad new age-y philosophical crap, some really bad stuntwork, and, oh, did I mention the bad acting and awful script already? *"
1,Bored,"While your watching the movie,just keep repeating to yourself: I will be bored, I will be bored."
5,Kira's legend continues,"These four episodes continue the excellent script/casts, which makes Death Note one of my favorite anime movies/series of all time (others include Cowboy Bebop, Witch Hunter Robin, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell). Light Yagami continues his role as the 2nd L in charge of the Japanese Task Force investigation. He continues to manipulate the police force investigation and at the same time carries out his plan as Kira. He does this by enlisting a very capable prosecutor, Teru, to carry out Kira's will. In addition Light has to continue to deal with Near, the true L successor and Mello, Near's lifelong competitor."
3,interesting flick-,"If you are a Stephanie Zimbalist fan, you probably would want to at least see this movie if not add it to your collection.While not as good as Remington Steele, it at least doesn't have a negative story line as some of her other films and does have some closeups and interesting shots of her."
5,Pleasant surprise,"Such a tight horn section. It's true people are reluctant to ever give up their copies of it because there are so many awesome players on it along with Monk himself, such as Jerome Richardson on also and Keter Betts on bass, both of whom have passed away since the recording was made."
4,"Matured, well thought out, guitar pop.","Having spent years writing angry-young-man, angst filled loud, pop rock, David Gedge brings us up to a coming of age. The songs are so well written and executed, this is the Wedding Present's answer to dismiss any doubts from rough period of releasing a single-per-month and losing some of the core members of the band. I believe this is also the first album in which the Wedding Present started to write songs as a band, as opposed to David Gedge writing everything himself. The extra song writing influences increase the durability of this album and the evolution of Wedding Present into one of UK's finest rock bands."
2,Picture is not correct,"I was in a rush, and bought based on the picture...and the word ""crowbar."" But the lens shipped is not the one in the picture. And will not fit in my crowbar goggles. So I returned. But they did ship quickly, and the lens looked fine. Just the wrong one."
3,Good Lens,"This was as I expected, original Oakley Lens, even though the picture of the lens is not the correct one (This is a regular lens and the pics show a double lens for greater anti-fog)Shipment as usual was great!"
4,Oakley,There super sick!!! They make everything an awesome color. And its the best lense I've ever skied/snowboarded with!!!! You should deffinently get them!
5,AWESOME - Have ordered 3 and Iam ordering more today!,"My son received one of these from his beloved grandmother many years ago.. He treasuered it-put it on his key chain. He recieved so many comments he ordered one for a friend at Christmas. The friend and his wife liked it so much they ordered 2 for their family members. Sadly, the husband and wife passed away tragically before the bird calls arrived, however, they were given to the family members when they came in. They were thrilled to have something from their passed family members My son finally wore his out and was not happy, so I am ordering him one today!They work great, are a great conversation piece and are inexpensive. They arrived quickly as well."
4,IT JUST WORKS!,Finally something that actually does what it claims and doesn't break the first time or comes with a bunch of defects and glitches. This is a great product. You can make different kind of sounds with it as you gain more experience. I would recommend this product!
1,Product did not function as intended.,"I contacted audubon support with no help and no response from them. The product seems to be as simple as open the package, pour some rosin powder on it and start whistling away.After hours at various locations I did not see one bird, To me this is a waste of money. I just wanted some birds to hang with and apparently that ain't going to happen.The product seems costly with the rosin needed to be applied every so often. On top of that the rosin pill that came with it was smashed and half of the powder was gone.Bad customer service, Damaged item upon arrival, If this was ebay I would have my money back.Save your funds and buy the cheaper one on amazon, or don't buy it at all and learn how to whistle... I would love to know where all these reviews tested this bird call because It did not work for me."
4,rim of the prairie,another great story by miss aldrich. this one captures the heart of the pioneers as so many of her books do.
5,A masterpiece of contemporary artists!,"As you all know, Sir Daniel Johnston is the best singer/songwriter of our era. He makes the most beautiful songs and lyrics, however we all know his limitations as far as recording and performing goes. This CD has the best of both worlds. I'm a sucker for covers, I simply love them, and these are all unbelievable covers of some of the best songs ever written. On one side, you've got the covers - it's worth mentioning the mind-blowing True Love Will Find you by Beck and the beautiful Living Life by Eels - and on the other side you have the originals for some nostalgic walkabouts and rainy days. Everyone who's a fan of music should own this. I wish they had a vinyl version.-"
3,A sensible compilation,"Not a great one. As an introduction to Johnston, it is adequate. True Love Will Find You In The End makes this cd a must have."
3,Good watch but there's no light.........,"The watch in itself is a good one, however, do not try to depend on it in the dark. Personally, the light function on a watch is very important to me so that's why I gave this 3 stars. Everything else on the watch works great especially for the price: $12.00. If not having a light doesnt bother you, this is a major steal at this price. For me, its rather disappointing. I never knew how often I used the light until I got one that didnt have it."
3,cheap but not as good as past years,This is a very inexpensive sport watch. I travel a lot so the dual time and alarm mode are very helpful. I also find uses for the stop watch function. It is easy to set and use as I move across time zones. The combination of analog and digital gives you two watches in one.I set the analog of the location where I am at and the digital function remembers my home time zone.I had this model watch several years ago and am glad that I have gotten around to replacing it. My last one lasted over ten years. I do not use it for every day. It is for swimming and vacations.Highly recommended.I wish it had a lighted dial but that is the only shortfall.UPDATE: It died. the waterproof seal failed and it got waterlogged.This one was inferior to the quality I got in past years from Casio
1,How to DON'T it.,"This slightly interesting book is advice from an older person to youngsters. The book is VERY incomplete, and only the first chapters are included. It is repetitive, and the language is arcane. These things are to be expected, but with the lack of content I cannot recommend you try it even for free."
4,Superb music for a rainy day,This album is pure atmosphere. Dark and dreary but at the same time hauntingly familiar. Not familiar in the sense that it sounds like anything else. Not even close. More like music that would be played in the background of your dreaming. Light some candles and dream away.
2,Urgh! Ruined by an Americanisation!,"This book is beautifully illustrated, however it is RUINED by the fact that the wombat at the end calls his Mum ""Mom"" (it would get 5 stars otherwise, the Wombat is my favourite ""native""). If you're going to write a book on an Australian native mammal, at least give it a sense of authenticity and an Australian ""accent"". I picked it up at a local bookshop and almost flung it out of my hands when I saw that."
2,Fun but no room,"My daughter is on the short side and she sits in this just fine. At 20 months she loves to watch the balls come down. However, as I see her play in it and now read the reviews I'm not the only one that agrees the play area is too small and her being a small girl, could probably play with this for a while but when she gets bigger it wont be much fun. She tries to jump in them but hits the sides and the middle is in the way. I was going to buy the one that has an open pit with a doggy head they can crawl through and mistakenly bought this thinking it was cheaper. Tag was wrongly priced. If I hadnt spent the time blowing it up and adding extra balls I would have returned it.I recommend anyone that is looking to get one that is open more so they can roll, play and jump in them."
5,Great fun,My 18 month old son loves this toy. He gets excited just sitting in it. I recommend buying the extra 100 balls to add to the toy. We have had many laughs watching him get in it and he is so happy while he is playing.
3,Nice but not deep enough,"My son LOVES this toy, more like taking all the balls OUT of this ""pit"" that is not quite deep enough to even jump into, because then all the balls come out. He likes the fact that the top, he can SHOOT the balls into it but instead of the balls easily coming down the spiral, they get stuck and we have to stick our hands up it and pull the balls down. We also bought more balls then came with it so they would actually cover the bottom part."
5,Very insightful book for girls & women with ADD!,"This is one of the best books about ADD that I've read. It is also very specific as to how ADD presents in girls and women. Historically, the majority of books and criteria for diagnosing ADD/ADHD have been based on the symptoms that present in boys. For girls and women, we get a bad rap by being blamed for our behaviors (which often turns to self-blame, and wondering ""what's wrong with me?""). I would strongly recommend this book. It was a total eye-opener."
1,F*ck these men!,"I'm angry to hear so much good thingz about them...I hate them now!They sucks, they insult the rap!Don't buy the CRAP CDS OF Aftermath records...F*ck these 5 cents cds, the D(isappointed)12 and the G-G-GAY UNIT!Listen the real rap like Snoop, 2Pac, DPG, D.H.P, No Limit, Ca$h Money, Swisha Hou$e, Straight Profit, Xzibit, LL Cool J, Ja & NaS!!!"
1,Poorly made,"First the pros:It's heavy enough with the suction feet to prevent the slicer moving around the counter.Simple to operate.Now the cons:The blade is so close to the metal surround it actually touches it and dulls the blade. I was not able to adjust this even by loosening the center screw and trying to move the blade.To clean the blade means getting a screwdriver of the right size to undo the blade assembly - I would have thought that a metal 'key' would have made this easier.The inner washers and belt assembly fall out very easily, so be careful not to lose them.The cutting is pretty slow even for home use.The inner gears are plastic - not sure how long this thing would last.The size is really only meant for small cheeses, fruits, and meat, if you wanted to slice a bigger piece of meat, you are out of luck as the sliding holder does not move to the left far enough to do this.Overall, poorly designed and poorly made, am returning for a refund."
4,OK So far,So far this Slicer is pretty good. A lot of the slicers in this price range have trouble with plastic gears internally going bad and do not hold up very long. (For Example my Edgecraft 610 got 12 uses out of it over 15 months. I called the company 800 number and got a leave a message.)I have not dismantled this one to see what the gears are made of but it's made in China so I assume plastic.It does a fine enough cut for thin sliced lunch meat and the whole tray slides as one. Cleans easy enough.The only problem I have with it is the top part that sets the cut width will push out if you press too hard. I press too hard because I am a guy and it's in my nature but I just slice with one hand supporting it and the other slicing.Let's hope this holds up.
3,For the price it works,It would be nice if it came with extra blade screws and a product catch tray. Juices run all over the place.
2,Cleaning Up,You can not disassemble for proper cleaning.The slide does not come apart from the base.You can only remove the blade.
3,Get By for a Wile,I just recieved this slicer. I found the blade a bit dull and had to use a very smooth stone to sharpen. It dose a satisfactory job sliceing Rye bread and turkey breast. To all beware the stated watts of 150 are at a peak output. The specks in the included manuel state only 80 watts. Thats almost one half what you think your getting. It does work but is a belt drive thats known to fail.I gave it a three star because it did work on cooked meat and bread so far. For me it was no trouble to clean. You will need a key to take off the blade. One must be made and remember turn counter clock wise only.
3,make sure you understand...,"that this is window blinds version 5. Version 6 is priced the same everywhere is much better. Its not made clear that this is an out-of-date version and I hope they change the description eventually. I just thought Id leave a review to warn everybody because I wasted my money and would rather die that go through shipping this back... If for some reason you actually want version 5, thats what you'll get and it works fine."
3,Add a little excitement to windows,"Tons of options to customize your desktop, although the customizations don't include matching wallpaper, which is disapppinting."
4,Read Before The Nightly News,After reading this book you will watch illegals crossing the border on the nightly news with a much deeper understanding. The author follows both the immigrants and the border patrol and does his best to give the most accurate and balanced view possible. A very good story and one that you will never forget.
4,The Devil's Highway,The conflict of the story is there are 26 Mexicans from different parts of Mexico that cross the boarder illegally. They cross the boarder into a desert they call hell. The desert is the Sonoran desert and is part of southern Arizona. In this desert there is no water also there are deadly animals and spirits. Some are left behind waiting for the return of others.I liked the book because its real and I could never picture myself going threw the desert with no food or water. I also liked the book because it described the surrounding and face to face things in that Arizona desert. I didn't like it because it made me think about people starving in the desert. I would recommend this book to people that like reading long stories. I also recommend this to people that like the setting of a harsh place.
2,WTMI,I found The Devils Highway nearly impossible to slog through. Not to make light of the level of human suffering the author was attempting to expose but I found it repetitive and exasperating. The author felt it necessary to wallow in the details and belabor the point by taking each individual involved and describe their role in the account or suffering separately and in meticulous detail. I wanted to shout at the author “I got it already” now get on with the story or as my daughter is fond of saying “WTMI” (Way too much information)
4,Mandatory reading for those against the 14th Amendment,"This story about the 26 men who attempted to cross The Devil's Highway, a section of the Arizona desert, in early 2001 should be required reading for any politician attempting to repeal the 14th amendment. This non-linear narrative explores the various reasons people choose to come across - from those in need of a job, to those who are trying to make a quick buck, each has a story to tell. This is a worthy addition the the discussion. It places blame equally on the US and Mexican governments, greed, poverty, ignorance, and coyotes, among others."
2,"Interesting story, poorly written","This story of the Yuma 14 had the potential to be one helluva of a story, as it does read as though it is fictitious. The fact that it's true is the driving force behind the story, only to be marred by the author's sloppy and at time irreverent writing style. He uses repetition of words and phrases in extremis, and he for some reason feels compelled to stick one-liners at the close of all his sections. The material is interesting enough without the reader having to be bludgeoned by tongue-in-cheek punchline passages. It really got annoying and detracted from the larger story of struggle."
3,The Devil's Highway,The book did not deal with what I thought it would. A little boring to read. It was very repetitive in chapters.
5,Haunting truth of the desert,Urrea sheds light on the numbers and figures we hear about by not only reliving their passage but also by naming them and making the victims matter. That to be too extreme in either side is unproductive and fruitless in this debate of Immigration reform. I will never forget the Yuma victims.
1,"Dry, hard to get in to, poorly written.","I was not fond of the way the first 20-30 pages of the book were written. Not great, dry and hard to get in to. Some of the short stories were good but I felt like I had to just plow through the book to get anywhere with it. Not my kind of read."
4,No Free Ride to the US,"Gives you a look at the immigration problems on both sides of the border, including economic, terrain, corruption onboth sides of the border (i.e.. coyotes)and having to deal with the ever-vigilant border patrol."
5,The Devil's Highway: A True Story,"An excellent book about the passage of citizens of Mexico, from Mexico to seek a better life for themself or families they leave behind in Mexico. It explains how the people who live in Mexico are exploited back in Mexico, and then how they are in the United States. The book describes the facts, the realities, and is very un-bias in stating those facts. It is not for the weak of heart, some descriptions are very graphic in details. A must read if you want to know the real story about what goes on between be border of Mexico and the United States."
5,Major Kudos for an Outstanding Resource,"I've read many books on Windows NT and Windows 2000 security. Most did not live up to my expectations. They were difficult to read and you needed a Computer Science/Engineering degree to understand them. In my opinion, this book is THE best book on Windows 2000 Security. Mr Cox and Mr Sheldon wrote a very easy to read, easy to understand, and most importantly, an easy to follow recipe for securing your Win2K systems. This book should be in every adminstrator's library. If you don't have this book, you deserve to be hacked! I teach system security, and this book is a valuable tool and resource, not just for me, but for my students. This is money well spent!..."
3,Good reading,"This is a book about drugs and traffickers. Desmond Bagley brings his own unique perspective into the picture. Totally different from the legalistic ""Snow Tiger"", this books pumps adrenaline all the way. But since the book was first published some 20 years ago, it does not have the social ambience to grip the reader in a vice hold. A good read anyway"
2,Old hat actioner,"Old-fashioned action thriller with one redeeming feature - a character sharing the same name as me! Pure co-incidence, of course. The Nick Warren in this book is a top British drug expert who finds himself on the trail of Iranian smugglers after an entertainment impressario's daughter is found dead in her own apartment after a heroin overdose, and vows revenge for her death. An oft-told tale unfortunately still set in the past with an old fashioned narrative and dialogue(does anyone really say OLD CHAP these days? Maybe in a Colin Forbes book . . .) which does not quite work now in print, but would certainly make a decent movie."
5,Awesome CD,"Wow, this cd kicks. This band is a great Christian alternative for the bands Fear Factory, Slipknot, and Sevendust. And they dont even sound Christian. Either way, the lyrics are solid, and AWESOME GUITARS! Get this CD."
2,DISAPPOINTED - It's a challenge accessing the Trackwheel,"The Krusell Classic Multidatp case for Blackberry 7130e looks good. However, it is seriously lacking in what is the most important feature - access to the trackwheel. The cutout which allows access to the trackwheel is entirely too small - and I am a female with very small fingers. I plan to return this case and instead invest in screen guards and carrying case."
3,Not bad!,I am a guy with big fingers and I had no problem with the cutout for the trackwheel but I did have to adjust the case (move a little to the right)to get a good fit. My only complaint is it needs the swivel adapter otherwise when the phone rings you must unclip from your belt unlike the pushbutton releases I am used to!
4,A Happy (Chinese) New Year romp!,"Dragons Forever is a typical Chinese New Year movie with Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao delivering the required mix of comedy and action in a formulaic, forgettably plotted but highly enjoyable number that showcases them at the height of their powers and agility amid much Three Stooges style tomfoolery. A villain who looks like Gary Numan after particularly bad plastic surgery and some dubious sexual politics make it look its age (vintage 1988), and it does have the single most obvious piece of stunt doubling ever for Chan (a high kick repeated from two different angles, and all too clearly looking like someone completely different each take), but it's infectiously enjoyable enough to let that slide.Hong Kong Legends' 2-disc UK PAL DVD boasts a great transfer with both subtitled Cantonese and dubbed English soundtrack options and a good selection of extras including featurettes, two deleted scenes, outtakes and trailers."
4,"Satire Reminiscent of ""the Wolfman""","When the movie started I was immediately reminded of the old Wolfman movie, right down to the clubbing of the wolf. As it went on I got some laughs as the political and racial satire came out, and the werewolf's mannerisms became more comically exaggerated as time went on as well. All in all, an enjoyable flick. If you're looking to come out honestly scared, you lose, but if you're looking for a halfway decent werewolf, something tolerable, or something funny, then this is a good watch. Considering the rent prices nowadays, go ahead and buy it."
2,Elvira is back!!!!!,"I could give a care for the movie. I remember it as a lame piece of dribble that was made watchable only because Elvira hosted it. All of the movies that were featured on her show were awful and I'm glad. All the better to make fun of.Elvira's Movie Macabre is the draw here. This show was not to be missed weekends here in the Los Angeles area in the eighties.I for one will happily purchase every volume that is released as long as it comes with Elvira's great one liners, hysterical bits and dead on comic timing. Great to see Elvira back in the limelight were she belongs! You go Cassie!"
5,It is the best CD ever by Dru Hill!!,"I feel that this is the best CD ever made by Dru Hill! The group is just the BOMB!!! They are really awesome, and I espically love their song These Are The Times! That is one of the best songs that I have ever heard in a really long time! Its the best ever, I think that everyone should buy this CD, even if they dont like R&B or Rap!"
3,not worth the money,"I Love Dru Hill, don't get me wrong. but there's nothing more frustrating than seeing one of their videos for the first time and when you get the cd the song(s) you like the most don't sound like the one you saw on t.v.. no you have to go out and purchase the single with the music exactly like the video separately. there were a few songs that I liked on there new cd, but for the most part the cd is somewhat decent. If I had to do it all over again would I buy the cd.... no"
4,good relaxing hip hop,well not being much of a fan of hip hop and r&b. i bought this abulm because of how deep is your love. the rest of the ablum jsut backed it up with very good songs. they are all different to the last one and you can dance away to them all. if are any kind of a dru hill fan go out and buy it. i am now a dru hill fan too. thanks guys for a record.
2,2 star cause only 2 or 3 good songs,"Man i thought dru hill would make way betta music then what they put out luckly i got the album by a dub cd , 2 maybe 3 good songs tops , they made to much junk and put out weak to many weak songs with no meaning now isint dru hill post to be a r&b group so why they try to take it to a dance pop joint of half there tracks best track on there easily these are the times"
4,"Da Bomb, baby!!!","Dru Hill pumped out another great CD! This album showcases a slightly new Dru Hill, with more bumpin' beats than slow jams - a definite plus. With the rhythm that will keep a dance floor jammin and the tunes that will keep the ladies happy, Enter the Dru is a phenomenal success."
2,Thought it would be better,Mostly girls like it. But for guys this album is very boring. The song with Method Man is sweet. But this album is not a keeper in my book. I heard their first album is better. Get the first album instead.
4,This is the BOMB !,"If your are a big DRU HILL fan, than you need this CD. I especially like the song ""Beauty"" because it's a great song and for personal reasons. YOU NEED TO BUY THIS CD NOW !"
3,Thay can do much better- Tasha,"I like Dru Hill but this album wasn't all that good, I just want to say that cicso is too much, he thinks that he is all of that when he is not. I think that Jazz can sing better then he can, he sound just like K-C OF K-C and JOJO, which JOJO can sing better he him. Pleaseon yall not album let Jazz sing ahole lot more."
5,'98 was a great year,"Bought this album in '98 when i first moved to Lawrence, Kansas. I have so many memories with this c.d. It's an excellent album and i recommend it to anyone willing to give it a listen. Check It Out!"
5,Excellent Sophmore CD,"First of all, I know I am writing this review about 7 years after the release of the CD. This CD has always been one of my favorites. However, after listening to the CD in my mp3 player on Friday. I had to write a review. Secondly, this CD should have won a GRAMMY- Best R&B; Album. This album contained an unforgettable mixture of ballads and uptempo songs.""The Love We Had Stays on My Mind"" is one of the top 3 best remakes of all time. Other favorites are - What Do I Do with the Love, One Good Reason, How Deep is Your Love, These are the Times, and I""ll be the One."
5,I have really entered the dru.,"Since the day my girlfriend introduced this group to me, my heart has never been the same. It has ""given me one more reason"" to love her the more. Sisquo is really talented. Woody has real soul. Nokio is the man and Jazz be fine. I can hardly wait for a new release from these guys. Let's hear it for dru hill. Drufans show them more love. Psst whatever happened to their official website?"
5,THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE!!!!!!!,There back again with their secomd album. Dru Hill has done it again.they have taken u to another level with their sweet voices. As u can see Dru Hill has matured a lot more in their voices and their bodies and is hitting the number one charts with How Deep Is Your Love and These Are The Times. This group has a lot going on for them. We hope to hear more from their new album Enter The Dru.
5,A very good album,"Dru hill's ability to sing and produce various tracks makes them one of the best comptemporary r and b groups. Not only production and vocal skills, but the ability for each member to play the instruments they do is amazing. I have always been critical of Woody's vocals which are not exploited as much in this album thant the previous but when listening to the albums again, I found that woody's voice is reminiscent of stevie wonders at times. But throw in Sisqo and jazz with the Nokio who appears to be the man behind the production, and you have a tight group. This album evolves from the uptempo freak me style to ballads that hooks the listener. The remake of ""The Love we Had"" is excellent."
4,Sisqo makes Dru Hill,"I absolutely love this album. Every song is good and very catchy. Stand-outs are Beauty, Real Freak, This is What We Do, and Holding You. It's a good thing that Sisqo tried his hand at a solo career because he has the most amazing voice, reminiscent of Jodeci's K-Ci. I think for a fan of R&B and lite rap, this album is definitely a great buy."
5,Still da bomb,"First,I am so proud of Dru Hill. They have done it again. It's really hard for me to pick my favorite song because they all kinda hit home, but if I had to pick one, it would be These Are The Times. I like to break the words of a song down and get the true meaning and the first time I heard that song it brought tears to my eyes. Again, keep making good music and you have a loyal fan forever. And to the reviewer who tried to dog Dru Hill, stop hating and give the brothers a chance."
5,This made my Christmas when I received it.,"I love this CD. I listen to it everyday. I'm so glad that Woody told us that he does sing. ""April Showers"" from their debut album was lovely. This CD makes me want to fall in love."
2,Wasn't that great...,"Well, I suppose if you like all the slow songs then go buy this CD. For me The first 4 were the only good ones. So basically I blew 17 dollars on a not so good cd. Sure it has a lot of songs, and maybe it is worth the money to some people, but my opinion is that it was a sad and boring cd."
2,A weak album.,"That's all you can say. The album is weak. There are only two good songs on the whole album, which are These Are The Times & The Love We Had (Stays On My Mind). My advice to you is not get this weak album."
2,Wasnt really feelin this one,"I keep hearing people say this CD is so good, but I guess maybe I'm not listening to it enough. I like a few songs on it, but the whole thing isn't worth putting on repeat--you better shuffle it with another CD."
2,Just one word folks : Disappointment,"After a perfect first album , I was waiting for a new Bomb , but this sophomore album from the Dru really disappoint me . Where are the solid smooth songs like ""Tell me"" or the funky sounds? . Two mediocre mid-tempo songs and too many ballads without any feeling . Let my give you an advice Dru : Learn and listen to Mr.R.Kelly !"
4,This album is the shit!,"Dru Hill really comes out in this album. Their harmonies in the songs are off the hook, they're so smooth! Woody gets a chance to show himself off in ""Angel"", and does a good job at it. The only problem I have with the album is the general flow of songs. At first, they got bass-pumpin' hits that'll rock you straight outta your ride, but then about halfway through the CD, they take a turn to slow, mellow love songs. To me, they could have made the transition flow better, rather than just snapping into another flow like that. Anyway, I think you should buy this album, 'cause you probably won't have the inclination to turn it off once you turn it on."
5,You can't beat it!!,"The best album on the market, by far. Their first, self-titled album was really good, but ""Enter the Dru"" blows it out of the water. Good rhythm, easy to listen to. If I could, I would give it a thousand stars!!"
5,Its the best album thats been released in a long time.,this album its class its a number one tribute to dru hill keep the songs pumping guys ya withit your the kings of R'n'B
1,when jodeci comes back,this group needs to quit with the straight up biting of jodeci.this group doesn't know the word originality.wack and boring cd.them and 112 can put you asleep real fast.
2,Down- hill for Dru Hill,"Jeez...when I first got this CD, I was conviced it would have at least ten good songs out of the seventeen. It turns out, the only good songs happen to be ""How Deep Is Your Love?"" ""Real Freak"" and ""Holding You"". I thought that the song with Method Man would be a tight track. Though it's catchy and is probably the fastest song on the album it just doesn't cut the string. I don't hate the album yet I just don't think it's Dru Hill at their beast. I don't have their first album, but I'm sure it's better than this one.Another thing is the terrible beats. Ginuwine was smart to get Timabaland to help him with his album. The only tracks with tight beats are the ones I talked about earlier plus ""This Is What We Do"".Lyrically, they are fine. The best singer of the whole group is Sisqo. I'm glad he tried a solo.If you liked Dru Hill's first album then get this one. If you don't have Dru's first album, forget it.-_-I HOPE THE NEXT ALBUM IS BETTER-_-"
2,Borderline,"Borderline second album featuring Sisqo and the boys from Baltimore. Lots of attitude and sass, but the songs never graduate from the predictable. Even the Babyface-penned ""These Are the Times"" is a bit of a snooze. This record isn't a disaster, but it comes VERY close."
4,Don't pass this up!,"I've enjoyed this one since '75, and still listen to it often. This is not groundbreaking stuff. Just great melodies played by great musicians. Laid back bossa nova, best enjoyed after dinner. For this $6.99 price, you can't go wrong!"
4,"According to our dog, these are great","Our Aussie chews bones up in no time, but these actually last him a while. The assorted flavors are good for variety. I give these to him to chew out in the backyard because I don't want him to stain the carpet inside."
3,Simplify...,"This is the prime example of a anime series being too complex for no good reason. The Dirty Pair are two special agents codenamed the Lovely Angels. The team consists of Kei the redhead with the short temper and Yuri the pretty one with the short temper. Kei and Yuri are always at each others throats but when it comes down to taking care of business they usually pull together. There are two major plotlines in this story arc: the first one consists of an assasin named Lady Flair,who outguns the girls and Kei becomes obssessed with bringing her down. The second storyline is a convoluted mess, it concerns Waldess a business man with plans to take over the universe,it's generic, poorly done and complicated for no good reason, the story is dragged down because of this. The animation is decent nothing spectacular but not bad either. Overall the interaction between Kei and Yuri is the reason to watch this dvd i guess i was just dissapointed about the plot."
4,this is not a sex anime guys,"It's interesting to see an anime show named ""Dirty Pair"" to get more guys to buy the dvd having them think they'll see some naughty girls, this show does have brief nudity but nothing sexually. It's just two special agent girls name Kei & Yuri who can't never get along like any childish dram queen little girl but anyway when it come to business they always work together. This collection has 3 dics the third dics I guess the Japanese back then were inspired by our American cartoon ""Inspecture Gadget""."
4,2 great heroines.,"Yuri and Kei are trouble consultants, aka detectives. They travel the galaxy solving all sorts of crimes. They are both very entertaining characters. Kei is a tomboy and she's actually a pretty competent detective for the most part. Yuri however is a fluff-head who's more concerned about getting a date than working. This anime is an action/comedy with plenty of fan service.Dirty pair was one of the first anime series I bought back in the late 90's and even tough it's quite dated, it's a whole lot of fun. There's nothing deep about this anime, but the fun factor is high enough to not require much of a story. I think this anime is a good price and would recommend it to any serious anime fan. If you're not an otaku you may want to watch it on youtube or something before u buy. There are plenty of way better animes out there, but Dirty Pair is a lot of fun. There was also a movie called Project Eden. I would avoid it."
4,One of the '90s most overlooked bands,"Simply put, dEUS was one of the most talented, challenging, and uncompromising bands of the second half of the 1990s. When the radio was filled with people still riffing off of Nirvana and embarrassing themselves as post-punk sound-a-likes, dEUS was doing their own unique thing with few people taking notice. The band has three full-length releases, all of which are beautiful, dense, and challenging. Their first album, W.C.S. is the perfect introduction to what is soon to be your new favorite band."
5,dEUS rules,"dEUS rules! just like Zita Swoon (with ex-member of dEUS: Stef Kamil Carlens) Suds&soda is a fantastic song. I like their 3 cd's: Worst case scenario, In a bar under the sea, The ideal crash (out from '99) I should say to everybody who appreciate alternative/rock music: buy al their cd's! They are musts!"
3,Real Estate Beginning...,Great book for those who want to know what real estate investing with no money really is. But just the very beginning. You will need much more than just reading a book to actually do real estate deals...
1,This Clip is not for the V60i phone,"This is an Amazon scam! The clip is not for the V60 or V60i phones. There is no way you can mount your phone on the clip.The box claims the clip is for the L7082, L7089 and 120 phones.So Amazon gets your money, you get a usless clip that would cost you more to return, than it cost to buy. Nice little scam.I wonder do they ever read these reviews. I wish I had, I took them at their word."
1,Not compatible,"Unfortunately, I did not read the other review prior to ordering this item. This DOES NOT WORK and it isn't worth the postage or effort to send back to Amazon."
5,A favorite...,"This book gave me the refreshing feeling of having a deep conversation with a kindred soul. When finished, I had numerous pages marked to reread, as profound thoughts are interspersed between interesting anecdotes from the author's own life...much in the same way that we all experience our everyday lives with unexpected moments of insight and clarity. For those who haven't read it, I also heartily recommend the author's earlier book ""Nothing Left Over: A Plain and Simple Life."""
4,Best I've Found So Far,"My four year old son will sit and watch this even though he insists he does not want to learn Chinese and prefers to watch cartoons. It moves pretty slowly, but it does have entertaining features, such as real animal photos, funny masks, and video of kids playing on the beach. The speakers are not native, but they seem to be taking care to speak clearly and use correct inflections. There is a decent amount of repetition. Even though my son refuses to repeat any of the words, I think it is training his ear to pick up Chinese more easily later. I find the pin ying subtitles helpful and wish they were provided throughout, instead of just the first time each word is introduced and during the recap at the end."
5,"""Chilly Scenes of Winter?"" A perfect book.","In ""Chilly Scenes of Winter,"" Beattie creates a crisp, objective (except for the subjective parts) snapshot of a life. Main character Charles (never Charlie!) yearns for what he doesn't have and believes he wants -- but maybe he doesn't. These are a few days in the life of Charles, his best friend Sam, sister Susan, love-of-his-life Laura, the ghost of Janis Joplin, and step-dad Pete (the dancing, Turtle Wax devotee) and Charles' crazy mother. And these days are at once funny,poignant, sardonic and absolutely riveting. Although it takes place in the mid 1970's, the references are a snap for any pop culture fan and the story is timeless. This is Beattie's first and best book. A must!"
5,Cowboy Story Telling!!,"If your an affectionado of real ""Cowboy Music"" this is a must have album.Each song is a short story of a period in time in the life a cowboy.The writers are cowboy wordsmiths, saying all the things you have ever thought or dreamed and wished you could have painted on to a canvas for time to judge.The lead singer tells the stories with heart as big as what he sings of.............the West! The background harmonies are nothing less then impeccable and it certainly is what you would have expected from a collaboration such as this.Whether you tapping your toe to an upbeat tune or closing your eyes and listening to the heart felt renderings of cowboy life you won't be sorry you made this part of you cowboy music library.Get it..............you won't be sorry."
5,A GREAT SINGLE FOR STEPS!,"STEPS 2ND SINGLE OFF""STEP ONE"" IS ""TRAGEDY"" . THIS IS A GREAT SONG.I LOVE THE DANCE MOVES AND YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE ALBUM.IT HAS GREAT SONGS LIKE ""TRAGEDY"",""SAY YOU'LL BE MINE"" AND ""LOVE'S GOT A HOLD ON MY HEART"".I LOVE STEPS THEY ROCK."
3,...weird...just plain weird...,"This is definately Danny Elfman. I enjoyed some of his soundtracks, so I looked foreward to Serenada Schizophrana. Yes, I throughly enjoyed the music, but it is weird...just plain weird... The artwork inside the CD case was weirder than the music, if possible."
4,Danny Elfman turns the music world on it's ear.,"Mr. Elfman is always traveling new roads in discovering what he can accomplish. ""Serenada Schizophrana"" is a good example of starting at square one and producing a whole new world for our ears to digest. In a musical landscape as far away from mainstream, one would expect no less than ears that could digest. Mr. Elfman is always flexing his artistic muscles, we can expect more greatness in his career."
5,Smooth ordering,Everyghing went just perfect!Even to Austria there was no delay and everything including payment and transactions were the way the are supposed to be. Thank you and have a nice day.
3,Definitely not what I expected.,"I knew Stereo Deluxx toured with Skillet a few years back, so when I found this CD in the bargain bin I thought I'd give it a shot. It must be rock, right, since they toured with Skillet? Nope. As someone put it earlier, pure CHR. I personally don't care for the pop genre, so I didn't like this album too well. Granted, for a pop record this isn't too bad, but if you're into rock and agressive stuff, don't buy this. I don't care if they toured with Skillet. They're still a pop group."
4,The Carter tops summer album,I love Lil wayne rap and Mannie beats on this album. The senior album is better than his last. let go to my rating of the album.Walk in 4/5*GO DJ 5/5*This is the Carter 5/5*BM Jr. 4/5.*I Miss My Dawgs 5/5 great song talks about time with the Hot Boys*We Don't 4/5On My own 3/5The Heat 3/5*Cash Money Millionaire 5/5*Bring it Back 5/5*Who wanna 5/5Get Down 4/5Snitch 5/5*Hoes 5/5Only way 3/5Earth Quake 4/5Ain't that a B****t 5/5* Favorites songsLil Wayne is one fo the best rappers alive
5,This this this this this.....This is Tha Carter.,"Wow. I'm a female second-year college student at the University of Maryland, and as an avid rap and hip-hop fan (and a fan of all music period), I was really surprised at how amazing this album is. The production is top quality and Mannie Fresh continues to live up to his rep as a hot producer...I'm big on beats and this one not only serves up fresh beats but also defiant, often freestyled lyrical quality. Nowadays you buy a CD with like 20 tracks on it and half of them are skits and only three tracks are good (and then you feel like you would have been better off flushing those sixteen dollars down the nearest toilet). But with Tha Carter, Lil' Wayne's best yet, if you are a true rap fan then you are sure to not be disappointed.And yes, a warning: After buying this album, you WILL experience random moments of walking down the street and the first thought that comes into your head is ""So hold on to your teenage daughter""."
2,"He Needs Beats Man, Beats!","It's probably Lil Wayne's best album, but he needs some way better beats and this album wasn't as good as say, Coo Coo Cal's ""Disturbed."" I'll give Weezy credit though, he can rap without having to bust out a pen and a pad. But that line about being the best rapper alive since the best rapper retired is extremely overboard. I'm surprised he's not hunted down by the hip hop community because busting out a line like that is like saying you're better than Meth, Luda, Eminem, Royce Da 5'9,"" Mystikal, 3 6, Dre, Daz, Kurupt, Ice Cube, Xzibit, Krayzie Bone, Twista, Run DMC, Too Short, Lil Jon, Gangsta Boo, MC Lyte, Da Brat, LL Cool J, Jermaine Dupri, Pharoahe Monch, G-Unit, Rappin 4-Tay, Master P, Eve, and all the other dope MCs in hip hop."
5,"""Best Rapper There ever will be"".","Lil Wayne is the best rapper there ever will be. There isn't a rapper that is near his level. Tha Carter is a classic. Tha Carter 2 will even be better.

1,Hush,Lil'Wayne is wack he sucks. Sorry but birdman and cashmoney they all suck. They have never been able to come out with a single that would at least be number one in Mtv or Bet. Lil'wayne doesn't have nothing he sucks. I rather hear trash then hear this crab. Lil'Wayne is wack. Birdman has never been able to come out with a hit. Birdman only took out a hit with what happened to that boy.He didn't even make that track. Clipse and Pharrell took that beat to the next level. You people dump even my grandma sings better than him.
1,lil wayne sucks monkey balls,"lil wayne is a piece of trash.. you cash money lovers need to understand one thing. lil wayne sucks monkey balls.. lyrically he competes with freeway, who is a piece of trash rapper that doesnt ryhme. Honestly, I have read a bunch of reviewers claiming that he is a lyrical genuis, I am not sure if this is a joke or are you people just that ignorant. The fact that he claims he is the ""hottest nigga under the sun"" is understandable because he is probably on a diet of cocaine and monkey balls but for people to belive this is absolutlety absurd. Expand your horizons people and stop smoking the crack and sucking the monkey balls. Listen to shady, g unit, and diplomats.Take my word of advise and don't give this pathetic excuse of a rapper anymore money."
1,sweda God man!,"Southern rappaz man aint got no talent. they all rap bout money n hoes. no skills son! Not like tha north wit talented rappaz like Nas,Jada,styles,fat joe,mos def , n tha whole Def jam north. yo son if south went up against tha north, yo son tha north will KILL THA SOUTH!"
3,i expect more,lil wayne has better talent than this.i recommend the new afroman disc. every beat be banging hard. join the streetteam on his website.
5,"5 Stars""Tha Carter"" Lil' Wayne has out done his self again!","Tha carter is a very important album in Weezy's career, I think that he did put alot of effort into it. He has came back with even fresher lyrics that twist up and become something that is into one with two meanings.I know he took this album all the way to the top and he will be having lots of support for it."
5,This is BirdmanJrJr from da CHI,"""That What Good Man""This is tha hottest album on tha market. Weezy, my favorite rapper, never lets me down. I put so many people on 500 Degreez where im from and they loved that so a lot of them went and bought ""Tha Carter."" Lil' Wayne just keeps gettin better and it's unbelievable. It's like I feel everything that Wayne say's, but that's probably because I'm his son BirdmanJrJrWayne you're a genious, these n*gg*s in tha game ain't got no choice but to respect you now. I don't care if u sell only 20 copies, keep doin' yo thang cause u got loyal fans out here that's just dying to hear what u comin wit nextDAFAMBROWN BOY'ZBIRDMANJRJR"
5,The Realest,"Lil'wayne is back with The Carter the realest album he ever put out lil'wayne can be gansta at one point and change his whole style and be low tone and serious the album has Mannie Fresh,Reel,& Baby Aka ""The Birdman""Hot Songs1.Walk In2.Go DJ3.This is the carter6.I miss my dawgs10.Cash Money Millionaires12.Bring It Back13.Who Wanna16.Snitch17.Hoes20.Ain't That A Bi**H21.Walk Out"
5,Top of the Line Entertainment,"I brought the Carter , and I just can't get enough of it . This album is talking about real life events and is very blunt and entertaining . A typical cd starts off ok and gets better as you get to the end . I was afraid that he only had about 2 good songs on it since it started off good but the whole cd is banging . Lil Wayne did excellent this time , and the beats are awesome as well . I won't keep bragging and spoil the suprise , JUST GO GET THAT !!!"
4,"""Tha Carter"" Rules!","i love this cd! i rarely find myself skipping tracks like i do with other cds, because all of the songs are cool. especially track 12! this is lil wayne's best work!"
4,Always like Wayne,I really like this CD esp. Go Dj...Miss my Dawg...Bring it back...and Earthquake....the club always sings along to that joint!
5,Blazin CD,"This cd is right up there with lloyd banks, weezy is back and he's bringing all what he has to this album, it's hot and you all need to get this, especially if you're a weezy fan!"
5,tight,This Cd along with Lloyd Banks are the two best of the year. Lil Wayne is the real king of the south. T.I better watch out because the eal king is back. This should hold me down until the new Nas cd drops.
4,weezy off tha heezy,"great album, first lil wayne album i heard, hes rap style is different but effective,hes a very good lyricist with a sick flow.him and mannie combine well.fav tunes:2many , there all good"
3,lil wayne still sound like he's 6 years old,I bought this album thinking wayne would have hit puberty but no.he has a few good tracks but most sound the same.The best track is Hoes feat-manny fresh it makes me fiend for his new solo album.Wayne sould have worked with soulja slim or Silkk or some new orleans cats!By the way where is the track GET SOMETHING His first video that was said to be on tha carter.step your gane up baby
4,Cash Money 4 Life,This album is crazy. wanye and mannie fresh do it again. Could have been a five but juvie is nowhere on there. but still itz hot
4,For Real G's Only!,"If you don't like gangsta rap and would rather listen to some Chingy and Ying Yang twins because they're ""cool,"" don't buy this album. Wayne blazes every track. His subject matter doesn't run deep, but if you're from New Orleans, you see where he's coming from. ""I Miss my Dawgs"" is one of the deepest songs to come out in 2004. The interludes allude to New Jack City's ""Carter"" building and they all add a cinematic element to the disc. Apparently, some reviewers don't understand allusions. Some may argue his self-proclaimed title ""Best Rapper Alive,"" but with the rap game as weak as it is, he is definitely in the top 5. Also, check out his new mixtapes, ""DJ Drama Presents: Lil Wayne ""Dedication,"" and his Young Money Entertainment mixtape that is a free double-disc download off of youngmoneyent.com. Get this if you need dope beats and a heron' flow to ride to."
3,about like 3.5 stars,"its a pretty good CD, the beats is sick, thats the main reason why this CD is tight. Lil Wayne got some koo flows but some of it just retarted like ""I sp sp sp....spit out shrimp"" or some junk like that NO!!! I use to be a big cash money fan and I hadnt listened to them in a while so i went to see what they got and its not bad. If you bought it, you wouldnt be disappointed. play it in the car and the bass will tear it up, ay and dont forget that TUPAC CD peace!!!"
5,Best Rapper Alive,"The Carter, Lil Wayne's newest album, is hot. He spits the truth. The tracks are just soooo hot you need to go and get it. It will be worth your money. Lil wayne got the South on lock!!!!!"
5,Off the Chain!,"Lil' Wayne put his foot down when he made this CD. It's the best yet. I like how he uses ""Walk In"", ""Inside"", and ""Walk Out"" as if the listener was really there. In ""I Miss My Dawgs"" Weezy lets the world know how he feels about the break-up of the Hot Boys and gives a verse to B.G., Juvenile, and Turk. My favorite song has to be 'Tha Carter because the beat that makes you want to move everytime it plays and the lyrics make you wlk around in public saying ""Hold on to ya teenage daughter"". This is definitely his best album yet."
4,Holding things down for New Orleans,"Lil wayne is definitly holding things down for New Orleans. With his new CD ""The Carter"" lil wayne is letting everybody in the rap game to step thier game up. This is one CD that is letting people know that artists from New Orleans will represent in the rap game. Lil Wayne keep up the good work, and continue to keep putting other rappers on thier toes. If yall do not have the CD, yall better go cope it before their isn't anymore left. Then again, you're being missing a classic cd from your CD collection."
2,LIL'WAYNE DIDN'T DO SO GOOD,HE COULD HAVE CAME HARDER LIKE DA BLOCK IS HOT AND LIGHTS OUT DEM WAS HIS BEST CD'S YET 500 DEGREES SUCKED ALL DA WAYMan I MISS MY DOG - 10 OUT OF 10Earthquake - 9 out of 10Birdman Jr. - 9 out of 103 best songs off cd
3,AN OK ALBUM,"THIS ALBUM IS GOOD ON LIL WAYNE PART. SONGS I LIKE IS THIS IS THE CARTER,SNITCH,THA HEAT,CASH MONEY MILLIONAIRES,WE DON'T, OFCOURSE BRING IT BACK.HOWEVER I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO GO COP THAT NEW BG LIFE AFTER CASH MONEY"
4,Very Good,"This cd is extra ill. Lil Wayne spits fire on every track. The beats i dont think are as good as 500 degreez but his rhymes make up for it. HOWEVER, with that said, I cant give THA Carter a 5 cuz Weezy changed up his flow waaaaaaaay too much. With all his pauses and tempo changes, he sounds too much like hes trying to rap like Jay-z. Dont get me wrong, Jay-z is my favorite rapper, but everybody needs their own style and it seems like Lil Birdman Jr. is losing his own."
4,This is the BOMB,Lil' Wayne has grown in to a superstar and his music and lyrics show it....I am diggin this as the best cd of 04 so far....
5,"HOT, HOT(...), THA CARTER IS OFF THE CHAIN!!",Lil Wayne surprised me on this album.I have never been a real fan of Cash Money only because I listen to a lot of Down South rap but this album has been successful in reeling me in. Lil Waynes's lyrics are amazing and the beats will keep you pushing repeat after every song. There is not one song on this album that I can say I don't like and that's a lot in the era of cd's with maybe three songs overall. LIL WAYNE THIS S*** is OFF THE CHAIN AND BRUCE BANTER QUIT HATINNNN(...)!!!!!!!!!
4,In All Honesty....,"I'll be the 1st to tell u, i'm not even a Wayne fan. But this album is good, trust me. It just so happened i was chilling at a relative's house and the only CD i could find to listen to was Tha Carter, which i'd never completely heard before, only some of it. I was bored and there weren't any other CD's around so i figured, why not?I decided to put it in and I listened to the whole thing and I was surprised that I actually did really like it, even though I thought I would hate it. It really is good, it has some catchy songs on here, and some feel good/living life type songs. Aint That A Bitch is one of my favorites. I am not a big Wayne fan like I said before but as a man I always give props when they're due, and Wayne deserves them for this album."
4,His best album next to Lights Out,"Standout tracks:THIS IS THE CARTER, B.M.JR(the hardest song on here), I MISS MY DAWGS(dope even though you and I know that he is full of s***), ON MY OWN, BRING IT BACK, WHO WANNA, SNITCH, EARTHQUAKE, AINT THAT A B***H, WE DONT etc. Filler: Go dj(crappy beat sleep inducing lyrics), Cash money millionaires, Get down(SNORE!), Hoes(Screams filler) and Only way. Bottom Line: Lil wayne's fourth album stands out as his best album next to his second solid work Light Out. What makes this album better than The carter2 is that the production is (for most of the songs) is not bad and he doesnt sound like an up north emcee clone. He is just being himself on this one."
5,"very consistant, it deserves 5 stars, maybe more.","tha carter will take lil wayne all the way to the top. this is probably one of the most consistant cds ive heard since notorious big's ready to die or master p's ghetto d. every track on it is very good exept earthquake, number 19. it gets a little annoying after awhile. but other than that, this cd is one of the best cds of the new centery. it brings the cash money type of beats so it makes it even better. dont listen to the other critics, they dont have a good taste of rap music, this cd is great if your a fan of juvenile or the other members of cash money."
4,Very Good Album,"This is a very good album. Lil' Wayne has greatly matured and proves himself as one of the best rappers. Basically, all of the songs on this album are great especially ""Go DJ."" and ""This is the Carter"". His lyrical skills are magnificient and if you are a cash money fan I recommend that you buy this album. It is definitely a must have album."
5,You Should get This CD,The cd is hype from the beginning to the end. If you havent gotten it I suggest you pick up. All his songs are hype. So go cop it.
4,LiL Wayne has been my baby since the Hot Boys!,This cd is hot I have always been down with lil wayne and because of me my boyfriend is all on his D**K and took over my cd's. The intro and the outro are outstanding I don't think I ever heard lil wayne like this but I'm liking this a little more than my boyfriend lil wayne if I ever meet you in person it's on and poppin. But I know that will never happen! On the real cop this one it's not a disappointment but don't forget the carter.
5,The best album this year,"The Carter is hot, and you don't own it you should go out the record store and get it. You can really relate to some of the things he talks about in his songs. His songs talks about everyday things, if you feeling down and out it can get you hype, u forget what your upset about. The album is just hot. Like I said if u don't have it you should go get it. Out in stores June 29th, go get it!!"
1,Lil Wayne is a Lil Wack!,"this guy is a pathetic excuse for a rapper, i dislike lil wayne alot and he cant rap and he is no good n his face is really just there for u 2 knock him out. this guy sux and i cant believe he is famous and selling records, its embarrassing and i hate him very much, his album would be just as bad as himself.----------- DO NOT SUPPORT LIL WAYNE ---------------"
1,Keep it in New Orleans !,I can't take his or Cash Money Records music serious.On the other hand Juvenile is a good rapper.I'm just tired of hearing about all the lute they have.Yeah Cash Money made it in the game and became millionares but it's getting old listening to them.Keep this gahbage in New Orleans.
2,"no, no, no","5 stars?!? not even close. 500 degrees was better than this and i hated that album. the first single released was ""get something"" which was a decent track and had the familiar wheezy flow, and i thought good his style hasnt changed at all. i waited months for this album and after hearing it i tossed it on the floor and spit on it. his new flow is aight but he doesnt lace tracks like he used 2, mannie was sleepin on the production....dont waste ur money, i only spent 9 and i want my money back."
4,ITS THA CARTER MUTHAF*CKERS!!!!!,I love this cd!!!!! Everybody is playing the carter in their car!!!!! I have all of lil wayne's cds but on this cd he has definitely grew into dwayne carter. He is definitely the heat in the blaze!!! This man gets much repect for being able to open up on I miss my doggs. Anyways much repect to Wayne for giving me something I can put on repeat in my cd player.
3,Review of Lil Wayne's Tha Carter,"I bought this CD a couple days after Christmas, it's pretty good.+I will rate the songs on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the best+1. Walk In - 1/52. Go DJ - 5/53. This Is the Carter - 3/54. BM J.R. - 3.5/56. I Miss My Dawgs - 4/57. We Don't - 3/58. On My Own - 2/59. Tha Heat - 3/510. Cash Money Millionaires - 4.5/511. Inside - 1.5/512. Bring It Back - 4.5/513. Who Wanna - 2.5/515. Get Down - 5/516. Snitch - 3/517. Hoes - 4/518. Only Way - 3/519. Earthquake - 3.5/520. Ain't That a Bi**h - 3.5/521. Walk Out - 3/5+This CD recieved 56.5/95 points, which is 3 stars+"
2,Nothing new!,This book does not have any new or orignal concepts. The book is filled with NLP concepts that have been in many other books. I was very disappointed!
5,Informative & Powerful,"This is an incredible work by Christopher Howard. He has taken his life's work and put it into a easy to read practical guide to make powerful change in your life. You can literally follow the steps in this book to, as the title illustrates, Turn Your Passions Into Profits. This is a must read for anyone who wants extraordinary results in their life."
5,For African-American alumni,"Schools in the book represent the spectrum of higher education in the United States, from large to small, Ivy League and liberal arts to state university to predominantly African-American. You'll find for each shool selected : the school's number of African-American students, faculty and administrators; scholarship and other aid programs for minorities; admission requirements, particularly standardized test scores; and provisions for remedial training and the availability of counseling and tutoring services."
4,Derringer the band at their peak,"A good CD I'll listen to a lot. Not as polished as '77's Derringer live. Unfortunately marred slightly with some Van Halen licks, apart form that a fantastic record that shows the band true to form. Get it before they discontinue it like so many other great rock CD's"
5,This is what you call LIVE!,"Have you ever wondered what a great rock concert would sould like captured on CD? Well pick this up and you will find out in spades!!!!!!!!The wild guitar rock never stops on this album.It opens with a Derringer standard Let Me In. Eventually you are led to Midnight Road,one of Rick's best songs and it sounds even better here live than it did on the studio album.Plus check out Roll With Me.The intensity is so hot you'll be calling the fire dept.!!!!!!!"
3,Derringer Rocks,"Taken during one of Derringer's best periods. This performance is not with one of his best lineups, but is definately one of his best song lists. If you appreciate ""If I weren't so romantic..."", You'll love the rare live versions from that Album here. Would rate the overall CD higher, but the other tunes are better on other compilations."
3,Review of Hurst 6-Speed Shift Knob,"Wasnt exactly what I was looking for, but it is still a nice item. I would expect a Hurst Item to have the Hurst logo etched in the side, this may be a replica. Works fine however."
4,ATI Radeon 9000,"I picked up one of these used for fairly short money, to put in a 2001 Quicksilver Mac.It dropped in and works well.It is only incrementally better than the Nvidia GeForce 4mx that I had in there before, but has twice the ram on board, which does seem to make Leopard run somewhat smoother and with a couple more features.Not the newest or best, but a capable solid display card for an aging machine with new software."
5,(Sick) a cultural history of snowboarding,"For anyone who started snowboarding after 1993 this book is a must read. No way..this is a must read for all snowboarders. I grew up in New England snowboarding on Burton Backcountry boards in my back yard. This books goes back and tells the stories of what snowboarding was all about. Back when you went riding for the fun of it...not to look cool. This book rocks and Susanna did a great job. Loved reading about the good old Jake Burton, Brushie, Roach, and Kelly days.. Man I miss those guys. Grab this book and head to the backcountry.."
2,This book was ok but she got some of the facts wrong,"I enjoyed some of this book however, some of the information presented in this book as factual, in fact was not. Also her historical section was deviod of reference to many of the true pioneers of the sport. As entertainment it is ok as a giuide to snowboarding and it's cultural history, it falls far short. It's as if it was written by someone who really doesn't know much about snowboarding and just asked people for their opinions, taking them at face value."
1,Lame,"Fake, pretentious, and totally dumb if you know anything about snowboarding. If snowboarders were like bands, this writer would be the cheesy a&r rep trying to be cool while making money off the peeps."
5,Review for Straight Freak Ticket,"Amazing album from an incredibly amazing (and underrated) band. Surely, the best or one of the best albums from this guys. Definitely a worthing purchase, as we don't have too many bands like them nowadays."
3,Disappointing major label release from one of the great bands of early 90s Seattle scene,"This album lacks the energy and sharpness that defined Love Battery's first three excellent records, Between the Eyes, DayGlo, and the murkily produced, but still great Far Gone. Has a couple of high points here, like Fuzz Factory and Harold's Pink Room, but mostly a lifeless set from an otherwise great, great band."
3,"Ok showerhead, but made of plastic.","I was looking for what doesn't seem to exist anymore. A handleld showerhead that wasn't all plastic. I figured at this price and being a Grohe, this would be a well built handled unit. I was wrong. This thing is made of plastic like most every other showerhead on the market these days. Save your money."
4,GROHE HAND SHOWER,NEEDS MORE POWER AND EASIER TO CLEAN. WILL JUST BUY A NEW ONE WHEN THE WATER STAINS BECOME A PROBLEM
5,Grohe,"Same reason given for rest of product., looks great works well, will see if hard water effects the water flow. Had good ratings"
1,shower head nightmare,"this shower head schould be taken off the market, one would be better off standing out in a very light rain.I would have returned it but it would have become someone elese's trouble.DO NOT BUY"
2,Looks Tough,"Looks are deceiving. I haven't taken this item out on any serious adventure yet but out of the box it feels rather flimsy. The light in the back that swivels is tough to maneuver and I think it will probably break off sometime. The front light is kind of dim. The radio and flasher are OK. Everything works as supposed to, I just wish I shopped around before I picked this one up."
5,"Detective Series, Quality of a well made movie","Helen Mirren is the best. I wish I had ""discovered"" her and this series a long time ago. Great stories without all the trappings of plastic Hollywood series."
3,Prime Suspect 2,"This DVD was disappointing given that I am a HUGE fan of Helen Mirren - I had seen it originally on TV long ago and even allowing for the fact that the English Cockney accent is very hard to understand, the volume on my TV had to be turned way up to even hear the dialogue............. I had previously gotten Prime Suspect 1 and that was much the same, so I am not going to be in the market for the following episodes which I had originally looked forward to purchasing."
5,Society's Finest is Awesome.,"Dude i love Society's Finest, though they just broke up they will all ways be awesome. Anyway, they are an awesome christian metal band, with awesome break downs and words. If you like this check out anybody at www.solidstaterecords.com that is also a christian label.Later man"
5,The Fantastic Wynton Kelly !,"I Heard a track of Wynton Kelly playing on Radio here in the U.K. and instantly fell in love with his playing. As one who loves jazz , especially piano jazz , he is a great new find for me . As For the review by ""douglasnegley"".. I am astounded that he can find any track Terrible . Clearly he has different taste to me ! I find them all so inventive and Wonderful . Cheers , Hugh"
3,"Great looking set, not so great to watch","This set is the part of the last two pieces to the entire He-Man collection. When they are all placed side by side, they create an amazing mural of castle Grayskull and of a ship flying off. And the artwork on the cards that come with these sets are great. A lot of care was given to how these sets look and you can tell. I wish Thundercats got the same treatment. But that's about where what's great about this set ends. This reincarnation of the show was pretty awful and not really that much fun to watch. If you need to complete your set to have the full mural, then by all means, buy this. But if you're looking for good, classic cartoons, I'd stick with the original series."
2,He-man done Anime-style...,"...that's the best way to describe this series. This is one of those, if it hadn't been associated with the He-man universe, the concept could have stood alone as its own series. I will admit, the animation is good and the writing is ok, but the bottom line that will always hurt this series is that it's not He-man and should never have carried the title."
5,Whispers Through time,"Great story. Didn't realize I had read the sequel first, but didn't matter.Both books were great. I love time travel books!"
2,Beyond the scope of most restorers.,"This book is good for a highly experienced restorer who has a TR4 in very poor condition and needs to do a lot of rust repair. It is not for your average hobby restorer, or anyone doing a restoration on a solid car. It provides absolutely no information on finish work and original TR4 details. I feel the restoration work this book focuses on is beyond the scope everyone except the top 10 percent of those in the hobby."
3,Basic fix up information,"This was a great book to start with, and helped me get under way with my TR4a. However, I felt the book didn't get in to enough detail to actually help with the issues one comes across during a complete restoration. Many of the obscure details were overlooked and left me having to scour message boards and piece together disparate information. I wish there was a book written by someone who has restored a Triumph and who documented the difficult details..."
3,Embryonic Tubes,"Just picked this up the other day. If you're a big Tubes fan you'll want to buy this, but be warned, these are very early recordings from the band's beginnings and is not their best stuff. Early versions of WPOD, Mondo Bondage and Brighter Day are interesting to listen to but the real reason to buy this CD would be to hear the songs that have never before been available. A lot of the subject matter in the lyrics can be found in later Tubes songs (ex. Whiz Quiz/What Do You Want From Life). Musically, these equate with early Tubes albums but lyrically, these songs are strictly the novelty type."
4,If you only own one...,"I own the VHS tape version, and must say that it is quite wonderful. I wish one could uniformly find good, solid, traditional productions of all of the standard operas on video, but this has become quite the exception rather than the rule. Later, we can check out the productions from the directors who can't keep their egos in check. I might buy a ticket to see their shenanigans once, but for the long haul, give me this. A relatively young Haitink keeps it moving along, and everyone sings well.If you only know the piece from CDs go for this one.Oh, and the Leonore #3 would have been played after the climax, before the last scene, when we've already heard the trumpet calls. Gustav Mahler may have thought it released the tension, and made the jump to the finale less abrupt. Playing in the opera was his idea."
3,Misplaced reviews.,Most of these reviews are misplaced here--they do not deal with the Valencia production. They should be removed from this listing.
3,A Warning to Readers,"Although I appreciate Amazon.com for providing a forum for customer reviews, it needs to be pointed out that the review of my book DEATH MAKES A HOLIDAY by ""Zaine Ridling"" is an unattributed cut-and-paste of a piece actually written by USA TODAY reporter David Colton and published by USA TODAY last week. While the review is very favorable, I hope that Amazon.com will nonetheless take appropriate steps to give a correct attribution to this copyrighted work. As an author, I am sensitive to issues of copyright law. USA TODAY deserves an attribution, if not an apology.In order to post this message, I am required to ""rate"" my own work. I will dodge the issue by going for the neutral middle ground -- a ""3."" (The system doesn't allow me to chose 2.5.)"
4,Fun and Insightful,"An overview of the history and changing perceptions of All Hallow's Eve and related (sometimes assimilated) holidays. The focus is primarily on Halloween in the 20th Century, with chapters on Halloween and Holywood, Halloween after 9/11, and Halloween and the gay rights movement.Enjoyable and educational, the author's personal love of this holiday clearly shines through. A refreshing look at an uniquely American holiday (however loosely related to ancient Celtic festivals)."
4,Farscape Rules... save it from cancellation!,"Vol 2.2 is a mixed bag; on one hand it has the moving, visceral episode ""The Way We Weren't"" one of the best of season 2, and on the other it has the sub-par ""Dream a Little Dream"" which was canned as the s2 premiere and re-worked to little effect. Still, Farscape deserves its accolades and is the best sci-fi show on TV. BUT SCI FI IS CANCELLING THE SHOW PREMATURELY! Search the web, fans, and join the massive fan effort to save FS from a series-ending season 4 cliffhanger!"
5,Essential farscape,"This volume posses what is in my opinion the best episodes of the series. ""The Way we weren't"" is crucial to the development on Aeryn's relationship with Crihton. It is also one of the most effective episodes in showing what Aeryn was before Moya. It lets us know that Aeryn's transformation is not spontaneous, despite her betrayal. We see peace keepers as something other than space nazi's and learn they are far more human than given credit."
5,33 years old and still fresh,I bought this when it came out in 1977. At the time I thought it was one of the best jazz albums I had ever heard and 33 years later I still feel the same way every time I listen to it. Dizzy plays with a restrained ferocity that perfectly compliments Count Basie's sparse piano style. Take the essence of jazz and record it - this is what you end up with.
5,Good stuff,"Despite everyone talking about the bad sound quality, it really isn't that bad. It sounded fine to me"
3,Ho Hum,"I LOVE Coldplay! But this isn't all that incredible. The two new songs are great and might be worth the price of admission if you're a die hard fan. Otherwise steer clear if you've got the two studio albums. The LIVE versions are really no great shakes. I remember when they came around on this tour and I DELIBERATELY didn't go because I KNEW they'd just repeat the stuff LIVE as is. The ticket price was waaaaaay overblown and mostly because the show was at a corporate, elitist BS venue, but I wasn't paying it. Not for Coldplay. Not now. This LIVE package proves my intuition correct.They're going to get a LOT better as time goes on. I can feel it. They've got a lot of songwriting to do and they're a GREAT band! The LIVE release is just a little too soon. Let them develop fully with a back catalog to pull from before releasing this. There are much more horrible purchases you can make, but I wouldn't put this at the top of my list."
5,Unbelievable Performance,"This DVD is unbelievable. The song, ""In My Place"" blew me away, which really involves the crowd. This DVD is a must-have for any music lover."
4,I like their albums better but........,Overall their albums are better. I want to see this band live but I have a feeling their more of an album band instead of a live act. Its very mellow. Sometimes too mellow. However each song is great.
2,A Yawner,"Coldplay just isn't a band that needs a live album. No surprises here. Every song is the same as it was recorded in the studio. The DVD has great quality as far as picture and sound go, but the songs are a yawner...that makes the audio cd very boring."
2,Yawner,"The DVD is great in quality for picture and sound. The CD does not have near as good quality. There are no suprises here and a live cd should not be made by Coldplay...why? because the songs are the exact same as they are on the album. All of their songs follow the same structure, same chord progression, same repetative beat. Yellow is to Politik as The Scientist is to Amsterdam. The worst song on the album would have to be In My Place, where he clearly doesn't want to sing the chorus because he probably is scared of going flat and allows the crowd to do it for him. The song is not as powerful as it is on the album. Just buy a Rush of Blood to the Head and you'll be more satisfied. A reviewer referenced Oasis copying the Beatles...well Coldplay copies U2."
4,Coldplay live 2003,"i really love this cd and dvd, my favorite songs on it are A Rush of Blood to the Head, Amsterdam, and Everythings Not Lost."
2,You have got to be kidding me!,"I loved Coldplay's other two albums, but I have never heard such crap! I am ashamed to say that it is not worth the money. He sings out of tune and can't harmonize for crap! Five stars come on people...rate the CD not the Band!"
3,Director got in the way of a great performance,"Coldplay is my favorite band and I've seen them live 2 times recently. I just recently rewatched this dvd and could barely get thru it. As has been previously stated by other reviewers, its like watching a 90 minute music video. Most of the concert is in black and white. Most of the camera shots are out of focus, very close up and not focused on anything for more than 2-3 seconds. In the beginning of Politik, when the guitars and drums are heavy, it looks like the camera is vomiting. Its pretty much unwatchable. Its like watching a strobelight with a different image every second. Hopefully if Coldplay decided to release another concert dvd (and i hope they do) they can get the director of U2's Vertigo tour dvd to produce it."
3,"Decent, but not nearly as good as other concerts","I am very picky about the concert CDs I buy, and this was no exception. I was a bit disappointed after having downloaded a handful of prior Coldplay concerts (as well as attending one). The songs add a little variety to the recorded versions, but not really enough to justify buying this set. Other groups (Dave Matthews comes to mind) have set the bar very high on producing variations on the originals, and Coldplay tends to stick to the studio formulas pretty closely. If you can ever find a recording of their 2002 concert at The Forum in London, it is a fine example of what this album should have been. The band is capable of a lot more, I'm just not sure why the label decided to use these particular tracks."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I was looking forward to Coldplay live, popped in the DVD, and took it out after 10 minutes because the sound quality was so poor. This wouldn't be such a problem if all of the same songs were on the CD, but not all the DVD songs are on the CD. I thought it was two audio discs when I picked it up... talk about misleading advertising. Why do I want to be near my TV to listen to it? Although I love Coldplay, I'm very disappointed in this release and would have avoided it had I known how shoddy the quality is, and that I was really buying a DVD with bonus CD."
3,Coldplay music is not very good 'live',"I loved both ""Parachute"" and ""Rush of Blood..."" and they've seen some heavy rotation in my CD player for the longest time. Nonetheless, I've never had a chance to catch the band at a concert and I thought that this would be a great way to make up for the lost opportunities. It was not.To me, the strength of their music is in the tight composition of the songs and achieving the right balance between emotion and virtuosity -- the topics in their songs are always pretty sober, but the reason why they sound beautiful instead of dragging and depressing is because of this. In live, however, this balance is totally thrown off and the songs do not sound as 'put together' as they do on the albums.In my opinion, music from bands such as Dave Mathews Band are inducive to improvisations and live concerts; music from Coldplay, however, is not. Fans will still appreciate this album, but I would not recommend this."
4,Love Coldplay - But the DVD isn't that great,"First, this is a great price for what you will be getting.-A concert-A Music live CD-Behind the Scenes tour.Bad:The concert DVD isn't made very well. It's a lot like their music videos, with quick cuts from one angle to another. Hard to enjoy the concert, its more like watching a music video.Good:You do get different angle viewing if your dvd player has such capabilities.You pay 5 bucks more than you would for a regular cd and you get the concert and live recording of the concert.Get to hear two unreleased songs - ""Moses"" and ""See you soon""Overall, very worth it, but be prepared to be disappointed in the concert dvd."
4,Very enjoyable,"Starting 2 years ago I found out about this group named Coldplay. The first song I heard was Fix You and it had so much meaning for me I started to follow there music. I've never been to concert outside of R & B music, but there music sounds so nice I wanted to attend a Coldplay concert. I found this CD on pandora and feel in love with the Aulbum. The music was great ( band, singing, crowd, and how professional the sound was). I bought the combo box (CD, and DVD) I must say the DVD on a nice size T.V. give you the affect as if you were there in the crowd with a floor seat.Amazon was the only place that I could find the CD & DVD combo. No walk in store had this must hear and see collection."
3,From the producers of Blair Witch Project......,"Musically the concert was great, and if you're the type that enjoys music videos as opposed to concerts you may enjoy this. I'm the type that enjoys live musical performances, and that's what I look for in DVD concerts. This was a letdown from that aspect.Bottom line: TOO MANY CAMERA CUTS.The recording is ok played through a Denon DVD2200, Anthem AVM20, Studio 100's, Servo 15 and AVM50.The selection of songs is great.The cinematography simply distracts one from the music.Here's to Coldplay getting a newer concert out filmed in such a way that the viewer feels like they are part of the audience and not simply watching a music video on MTV."
5,bought this for my son,I would asume this is a great performance by coldplay but i haven't seen it yet. I would buy this again for myself if i had too.
3,Must have for Coldplay fans,"OK, I like ColdPlay. I thought this ""Live"" CD and DVD combination would be worth listening to, and it is. One of the things I like about CP is the high quality of their recordings. This one just doesn't measure up to that, and the songs are performed very much like the studio versions. Not much variety here."
2,pale,"Coldplay, like most English bands, doesn't really deviate from the studio version when playing live. This makes for a predictably likable set. With only two CDs it's too early for Coldplay to release a live recording. In the documentary (included on the DVD) you get the feeling that Chris Martin doesn't think his band will last. The U2 influence is undeniable especially considering how far the band has come in America in such a short time. It's also a testament to how bad the music scene is today.The bonus CD is tracks from the same concert as the DVD and offers noting new.For completists only.[DW]"
4,"Great Sound, Just Not Enough Of It","In a short amount of time with just two albums, Coldplay has formed itself into one of the world's best bands. They are Radiohead for the masses (not a criticism). Their live shows are amazing, and so comes this live CD and DVD package.The DVD portion features some of the better concert footage you'll find. The plethora of camera angles provides a variety of viewpoints, from the middle of the crowd to the mic.The show transfers well to the CD, which is mixed nicely and gives the listener a full experience, from crowd noise to the energized music.The only problem, really, is the CD's length. It lacks some of the tracks included on the DVD, like ""Daylight"" and ""Trouble,"" which are no more or less highlights.Still, for any fan of Coldplay's albums, especially ""Rush of Blood,"" this live offereing is a worthwhile buy."
2,DVD Problem,"The rate would be a good 4,5... but the DVD doesn't play in Europe... So don't buy it if not American... otherwise music is neat, enjoy it, America.Marko Smolej, Slovenia"
5,"If you weren't there, this is the next best thing","Shut up the two before me, Coldplay is the greatest band in the world, and the fact that Chris is going out with gwyneth paltrow makes no difference to the music. A must buy for any Coldplay fan."
3,Hey get off the Cranksters case.,I aint bought this yet but will do because old cranky has the opposite views to me. What he says is bad is good as far as I am concerned. Most of his reviews are getting repetitive though. Any chance of a another review similar to the blender review? Another thing this bloke or blokess must be an unemployed millionair. He reviews 4-10 cd's a day. I wish I had the spare time and the cash to splash like he does! Anyway Cranster keep up the work but lets have a little variation of the theme.
3,"Great band, bad editting","Coldplay is one of the best bands out on the scene today, however the director of this concert should never be allowed to film another live performance again.The video editting of the concert is really bad. The director does not allow one camera to hold a shot for more than 4 seconds; it quickly blasts from camera-shot to camera-shot. You can't even focus on a particular member of the band for more than 4 seconds because of the quick camera changes, odd zoom and camera angles, and the constant ""arty"" out-of-focus shots. I want to be able to peacefully watch Chris Martin play the piano, but I barely can because of the weird camera angles and constant switch of cameras.Coldplay is a great band, but I would have loved to have a concert that was filmed as a basic/ordinary production and not having the director trying to be all ""arty"" and do neat camera tricks, it's annoying.In any case, the band is great, they played great."
2,Awful sound quality,"For the sake of avoiding getting this review tagged as unhelpful, my comments are geared specifically towards ""audiophile""-types who are very concerned with the quality of sound reproduction. If that isn't your thing, feel free to ignore my comments.I really enjoy Coldplay, but the sound quality here is unforgivable. I couldn't bring myself to listen to much of it on my high-end system. For Coldplay fans who are also audio freaks, this album is not for you."
5,Amazingly well done DVD & CD,"First off I wasn't a huge fan of Coldplay until I saw them live in September of last year in Boston. They put on an incredible, energetic show that blew me away. When this DVD came out I had heard Moses, the new single and was impressed so I bought it. I have to say I ended up stay up WAY too late the night I bought it watching the whole concert and the Tour Diary. I actually got goose bumps watching it. This DVD/CD is worth every penny."
5,"Music excellent as usual, just one niggling thing...","Coldplay makes for a brilliant live band, with no fuss and no unecessary flash. They might be a bit dull compared to others but they offer what many dont, the pure uncommercialised soul of what music should be.Now we get to the dvd (which is frankly, probably more than half of what you pay for). I had to experiment with about 7 dvd players (wouldnt work with ever-so-efficient microsoft windows media player.. something to do with copyright protection apparently *rolls*eyes*) before i could get it to play. i'm just wondering whether it's to do with different region codes (region 1 on my computer). anyone else have this problem?nonetheless, very much worth the money for anyone who apprecites coldplay."
4,almost perfect...,"First off, I love coldplay from there album ""Parachutes""... So of course I was eager to see what the live album was about... So I did some research before buying it, and finally bought it yesterday... The sound quality is excellent, the bonus dvd is awesome to say the least... Almost like you were actually at the concert... A awesome experience... The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is cuz the cd is missing songs from the dvd concert... On the dvd you have 17 songs, and on the live cd, 12 songs... I know, I know, they couldn't put them all on the cd cuz otherwise it would be a 90mins cd which doesn't exist yet... Oh well... Great work anyways Coldplay ! Can't wait for new material..."
3,Not Worth Purchasing,"I like Coldplay, I really do. However, a DVD which showcases them live, in a large venue ruins the experience. Coldplay is much better in an imtimate setting and watching them play to masses is unsettling . My biggest problem with the DVD is the choppy editing; the picture can't seem to focus on one moment. Nine video cameras being used for filming is far too excessive.Another problem is that they are trying to transform their beautiful, simple songs into epics. Check out the version of ""Yellow"" in this set and you'll see what I mean.So I guess what I'm trying to convey is to spend your money elsewhere. If you want to watch Coldplay in person, try to catch them on a club tour(if they still do that). Their songs just aren't fit for arenas."
3,delay delivery,"i bought it in october 18, its november 22, and im still waiting for it. where is it?????????"
5,This blade cuts wood fast!,"There is a difference between tree saws. I've used three of these. They are very sharp and very hard and zip through wet wood. For a three inch branch, I would rather cut with this blade than a chain saw. Very good product!"
3,Very Good but ...,"A good book but not as good as others in her Witch World series. An easier read than many of the books in the series and is true to her style of good conquering evil but the stories are a little too mellow from the Norton I first read years ago. The suspense is much shorter lived than in many of her earlier works. Evil never really seems on the verge of triumphing as it always did, you just seem to know that everything is going to be all right in the end. Add to this the fact that there are too many characters instead of the concentration on one or two that was characteristic of the Norton of old and you have a very tame book. There is no empathy because you never really get to know the players in the game. Still, a lesser book by Andre Norton is better than many an author's best effor"
1,I cried....,"because of boredom. This book, my opinion, is the stuipdest thing ever to be put on the printed page. Andre Norton is a terrible writer. I read about 75% of the book andit was one of the least enjoyable times of my life. Andre Norton sucks!!!!!!"
5,Two negatives make a positive...,"Angry? Check this one out. Soon, you'll be feeling better. Lonely? Ditto. Lost? Ditto. All I can say is ""Times Square""."
4,sch-a850,I received the wrong battery within 2 days. Then I e-mailed DLN and received the correct batter 2 days later. It has worked well.
1,this is NOT a new battery,"It was fully charged when it arrived, which told me it wasn't fresh and new. It works, but loses its charge after a day or so - much faster than a brand-new battery."
5,Great shipment.,The product was shipped in a timely manner and arrived as described. I would purchase from this seller again.
4,Great covers!,"Some of Overkill's finest playing can be heard on this album!I was really dissapointed with Necroshine,but when this album was released,I thought""AHH!What a refreshing album!""My favorite covers on this album are Space Truckin',Never Say Die,Death Tone,and Tyrant(I was always a good Judas Priest fan)Thanks,Overkill!"
2,"ITS WORTH THE $,","I have been a overkill fan for many, many, yrs. now. And I gotta tell ya, outta all there albums this would be the one I like the least. Don't get me wrong I like it its worth the $ it has some good song's. But it wasn't at wreck neck speed! But,if I had to buy it again I would."
5,Great Book,I have fully enjoyed this book and would recommend it. I have found many diverse recipes for morning to night and use it a lot.
5,It works well,"The holster accessory for the VX4400 phone I've found is about the only thing that works to secure your phone. I've used neo and leather cases, which seem to always interfere with the phone's operation. Buttons or parts of the display seem to end up obscured.But the standard old plain holster seems to work best."
4,Lesser Known Comedian,"Russell Peters isn't a terribly well known comedian at this point, which is a crying shame. He has a varied range of humor, from the typical off the cuff conversations with his audience to the lead through jokes that carry through the entire act. I picked up this CD as a gift for someone who had never heard of him and there was nothing but laughter the whole way through listening. If that isn't a good recommendation then I am not really sure what is.Many of the jokes are racially based but they are not racist, and that makes it even better. He has some very accurate and funny observations to make, and even comedic advice. There is very little profanity and very little vulgarity which is a nice change from most comedians.The only people I can think of that wouldn't care for Russell Peters are those with an overabundance of body hair."
3,Looking in the Wrong Place?,"The first (and only) review I see was ""helpful"". I wouldn't buy a Roy Drusky album without ""Three Hearts in a Tangle"" (his best) on it. Roy Drusky died this year having put out a number of albums, few of which are shown in this venue. He was the kind of singer you might expect to hear/see on the Grand Ole Opry for his entire career but going nowhere else. He did produce some other singers' albums along the way and might have been a bigger star with some better material. He made ""I Can't Tell My Heart That"" with country legend Kitty Wells and recorded also with Priscilla Mitchell who I think is largely forgotten. You might want to give ""Anymore with Roy Drusky"" (or something to that effect) a try. At least it has ""Three Hearts in a Tangle"" from 1961.And there are Greatest HIts albums by this man, just not in this venue. YOU decide if they're great."
5,The album that broke these guys nationally. great stuff,"I first saw these guys back in 1995 when they just released this album as their 4th independent release. They are a Madison/milwaukee area favorite group, and have a unique sound once heard its hard to miss. This album was out approximately 4 months when they signed with Atlantic records and in april 1996 released ""The Gufs"", which took many songs from this album, but replaced other. The replaced songs were later re-issued by Red submarine as ""the collide sessions"". This is a must get album for gufs collectors, and is rare since it had such a short sales life. Also, check out the band's web site, the just released a new album ""a different sea"", first new album in 7 years, but the same old gufs."
3,"Pretty, but generic floral perfume","I like this scent but I don't love it. This is a light, floral perfume, with some sweet notes that are verging on fruity, but aren't especially juicy. This is a dry, airy, sunshiney scent, but it's a bit too generic for me to buy it again. I enjoy wearing it, but there's lots of other perfumes that give this effect too. I wish I could give half-stars because ideally I'd rate this a 3.5- nice enough, but absolutely nothing special about it."
2,Not Riley's Complete Works,"I could not find some of Riley's most beloved and well-known poems, such as ""The Raggedy Man"" and ""Little Orphant Annie,"" in this ebook. This does not seem to be a complete collection of this author's works at all. The illustrations were nice, but overall I was very disappointed with this selection and would not recommend it to anyone looking for a complete collection of Riley's poems."
4,Love Poems by Nikki Giovanni,"I've never really been into poetry, but decided to ""broaden my horizons."" I enjoyed this work very much. It was so real; so fresh; so true to me. I had always heard about Nikki Giovanni's writing, and now I'm sold...on her and on poetry."
5,An excellent primer,"Gail Fairfield has written an excellent primer which covers the basics of chart interpretation in a thorough, easy-to-follow, and humanistic way. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to read a chart without giving in to fatalistic thinking."
4,good book,"I didn't think I was going to enjoy this at first. Just glimpsing through it, looking at the interpretations, I thought it was just another book that takes the tired formula of keyword 1 + keyword 2 to get its interpretations. In a way it is, and the result is sometimes clumsy such as the Neptune in 9th house interpretations ""act out vicimization through selling or advertising"" and ""show trust through knowledge"". Huh? Were these thrown together or is it just me?Well, that is why the book gets four stars instead of five. The actual text and information is great. I've consumed countless astrology books and the author still provided me with something new, even an Ah-hah moment. In all, I loved this book and know I will come back to it. I will just have to skip the formulas."
4,Am I the only one giving this book a critical review?,"I have found this book useful... the tutorials are pretty good and there is alot of information, but like someone else here has said, it is a little wordy. I think that this book would have been better if there were more tutorials and less description as I tend to fall asleep after a page or two of descriptive text (web design jargon has the ability to make my mind wander to beaches with girls in high cut bikini's etc etc).Maybe I am being critical because I have tried to read this book from start to finish, and failed miserably. As a reference guide this is great though, and like I said before the tutorials are very useful (just wish there were more of them as I learn more through practical usage)."
4,Good Book,"Better than Dreamweaver MX 2004 ""Training From the Source"". This is a step by step book for beginners thru experts. I found it easy to follow and understand. It is also a good reference book for the experienced, which I am not. Why Macromedia could not furnish a book like this with there software I will never understand. The same goes for the new Dreamweaver 8. They want you to buy there product but not show you how to use it. This is a good buy."
5,Great,"You can't ask for more out of a software manual than this book gives. Easy to follow, as a reference or a start-to-finish guide, and amusing at times. I would highly recommend this book for any novice or experienced Dreamweaver user."
3,So-So,This cornbread is not as sweet as I would like. I used paper muffin cups when I made it and half the muffin stuck to the paper so that was a bummer. I think I like my mom's homemade GF cornbread better.
3,Good,My daughter has eaten gluten free for quite awhile and showed me the best products and this corn bread mix was one of them....She adds cheedar cheese...green chiles and a can of corn and says it is delicious..but as all this type stuff..it is pricey...it makes one small pan of corn bread for the cost of about 4 dollars...you use buttermilk for this instead of regular milk...
5,"Used Almond Milk, Egg Replacement and Earth Balance Butter","This cornbread was very tasty, considering all of the modifications that I had to make to accomodate my son's food allergies (Wheat, Diary and Eggs). I made by own buttermilk by adding cider vinegar to unsweetend almond milk. I used Earth Balance's Olive Oil butter in place of the butter required. Lastly, I used Ener-G's egg replacer for the egg required. It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked so the next time I make it I will increase the sugar. It also was a tad dry. Notwithstanding, it still tasted very good. I will definately buy it again."
2,Tough to use,"Cuts twigs just fine, doesn't work to well on branches thicker then a half inch. Wouldn't recommend for the price,"
5,Crystal-Clear Writing on Sculling/The Elements of Style,"Boyne writes clearly and succinctly on all aspects of sculling.In a most illuminating way, he covers everything from the disciplines of form and motion (and mind) to the most technical matters regarding pitch, rigging and all manner of equipment. And yet this is not an intimidatingly thick tome. Nor does it feel like a manual. I see it as the Strunk & White of sculling--a pithy volume that answers all your questions and then some.Boyne has a gift for explaining the nuts-n-bolts of rowing, but he is just as illuminating when addressing the more abstract and intangible aspects of the sport.The drawings by Ellen Kennelly are also very helpful and well done.I would reccommend this book to any level of sculler and any athlete."
3,Good not great,"If you're only buying one book I'd recommend ""The Sculler at Ease"" by Frank Cunningham. Cunningham's book is more dated (with regard to equipment) and quirkier, but will teach you more about the sculling stroke."
3,A layman's guide,"This book is a limited information know-how of panic disorder (PD) for the common man. As I was looking for an in-depth information to use in my M. Phil. thesis, it did not help me much. However, if you are looking for a layman's guide, this work is expected to help. It contains concise and to the point answers to the patients' FAQs."
4,Great light but miss two features...,"Pros:Its very bright.Very secure.Various inserts that mounts it more forward or backwards for different handguns.Waterproof and shockproof.Cons.Not a True Quick Detach :( You have to loosen/ tighten the hand screw alittle or else it might fall off. I mean Whats the point of not having to put your hand in front of the handgun if you can no longer quickly attach/detach the light in a combat situation? I think it defeats the purpose. I am going to try to modify the spring to give it a stronger clamp so i may no longer have to tighten the screw, well see if it works.No kill switch to prevent it from accidentally turning on. Not a big deal when mounted on handguns, but on primary weapons the light can easily be bumped on."
4,TLR-1,For Tactical shooting it is great. I have had for a month and love it. Easy to install and move between weapons. Only product I would replace it with on my SR556 is the MVF-515 from Crimson Trace that would stay on that weapon. Huge difference in price between this cost effective unit and the MVF. Would buy again if needed. Service from AMAZON was great.
4,Good light.,Streamlight makes a good product. The only problem i have with this light is that the toggle switch on the back of it is a cheap plastic. My opinion streamlight needs to charge another dollar or two and put a good switch on it.
5,StreamLight TLR-1,Bought the StreamLight TLR-1 for my Sig 226R.Pro:-Good value-Easy to get on and off any rail.-Con:-not as tough as SurefireConclusion:Great value for civilian/normal condition usage.Sure. It is not as water proof as the Surefire ones but the price is way more attractive.
4,Quality Light and quick delivery. Another Satisfied customer of Amazon.,"This light went on my glock and another one went on the 12 gauge. Works great, Very Bright, and decently priced. I however did make a mistake because I thought this model had the strobe feature which it does not that feature comes on the TLR-1s which I didn't carefully read about I thought there was just the TLR-1, -2, -3. Didn't know that if you wanted strobe feature that would be extra and add a ""s"" to back of model number. Was going to go for the TLR-3, but for an extra 20 I would have a more solid built model made of metal rather than plastic. Ordered 2 of these on the 6th of February and recieved it in less than a week with FREE SHIPPING."
3,Read and Heed,"Just read a little deeper .... I was looking for a tactical light for one of my two primary handguns. My first weapon of choice is a Glock 22 (.40 cal). This light is marked to mount on all Glock handguns with factory rails. Once the light arrived, I realized that factory rails means factory rails. It doesn't mean you buy a standard Glock and the light fits. I own 2 Glocks, and have caried Glocks for 15-20 years with the military and police. This light will NOT mount on a regular off-the-shelf Glock. It is a great light. It does mount on my pic rails for one of my other weapons, but it did NOT meet the requirements for what I bought it for. (Maybe I should have researched it more. On the Streamlight website, under compatability, it clearly states that the Glock must have factory installed rails.) I will be saving my money once again and hunting up another tactical light for my Glock. Once again, the light itself is AWESOME, but be wary of the mounts."
4,Streamlight 69110,"Good product, very bright and compact. Only thing is that the light beam cannot be adjusted to concentrate the beam or dispersed."
4,Bump In The Night,"Great add-on for Glock platform for low light/no light use. The bulb is ""blinding"" and a must have accessory for duty or home defense applications. Very Impressed with this product by Streamlight ! I like the easy on and off use of the upper mount and the fact that it has Made in the USA."
5,TLR-1,Light is extremely bright and holds its value. Used on many missions and has been through some rough hits and weather and continues to hold up.
5,Great product !,"Excellent item ! Very bright, high quality construction. Great deal for the price. Holds up fine when shooting, mounted it on my glock 19 9mm. Put about 100 rounds through it didnt loosen, and the beam didnt flicker. Makes a room as bright as day. Highly recommended for anyone needing a taclight for a rail. Fits fine on my Ar-15 rail as well. The switch setup is very convient too, it has an on/off switch or a breif hold to stay on. The switch sits real close to the trigger for fast access. Swithc setup is for left or right hand. Also mounting is easy just need a coin or something to twist to tighten, dont even need to put your hand in front of the barrel. You get the quality of a taclight that costs twice as much for a fraction of the price."
4,Streamlight 69110 TLR-1 C4,"Received light in great condition. Had no trouble mounting to pistol after attaching a rail. Very bright beam, easy to turn on. A bit difficult to remove/install batts but not a real problem. Very well made."
5,great product,Best $100 I ever spent in my life. Great product for home protection. Tested this on my wife when she came home in the day time and it blinded her. Of course I only used the light it wasn't attached to my handgun. If a intruder comes in the night and this light is shined in his eye there is no question you will have the upper hand!
1,"Dear God, why can't they get it right?","You'd think that the author would be specific enough. Clearly he doesn't hate Penn (the Ivy League in Philadelphia that has an awful football team). He hates Penn STATE (the giant state school that is located in the middle of nowhere and belongs to the Big 10 -- you know, the ones that are good at sports).They are NOT synonymous... so why does the book have this title?"
1,What's the point?,"What is the point of this book? Penn Staters could easily write, ""I Hate Penn:304 Reasons Why You Should, Too.""Penn Staters certainly hate being confused with snooty-lousy-at-sports Penn just as much (if not more) as Penn grads.The author pokes fun at PSU throughout the book but I'd take a wide open, large beautiful campus (even if it is in ""the middle of nowhere"") any day over Penn which is smacked into a few blocks of Philadelphia in the midst of traffic, noise, pollution, litter, etc.My sister is a Penn grad and I did my master's at PSU. We couldn't care less. The author is a man that clearly is high on his Ivy education and has to make a point about it to everyone by declaring NOT PENN STATE! By the way, Penn doesn't even offer half of the programs Penn State does, including a degree in my profession.Plus, Penn stinks at sports. What do you think Penn students are doing during Bowl Game Season? Writing books like this since they can't cheer on their team!"
1,Penn State Rules,"I'm glad that you had to go to Penn to turn around and write a book about Penn State. If you are that obsessed with Penn state why didnt you save the 80,000 extra dollars you had to spend to get a degree from Penn and just go to PSU. There is a reason that everyeone who goes to PSU has great pride and it has the most active alumni in the world, because it is the best.WE ARE PENNSTATE."
3,Great for kids. Perfect for car rides. Good Buy for the money.,"I give this three stars because it met my needs well, but be careful if purchasing for anyone over about age 12, maybe 14. Content is somewhat outdated, but for kids who love jets, this was great. The audio itself is dated as well, as the narrator sounds as if he is speaking to a classroom around the year 1980, but again, I purchased it for kids and they love it. It is formatted much like a classroom learning tool, but is a very good buy for the price if you are buying for youths."
3,Watch You Don't Slip On The Groove,"As a UK Bananarama fan i thought it would be a good place and time to review this album.Firstly Bnanarama had hits in the UK from 1981-1993 they never had a #1 over here but in the US they hit the top with venus UK #8.In 2005 for the first time since 1993 Bnanarama released a new single in the UK it was Move In My Direction it peaked at #14 and was a huge club hit.The follow up Look On The Floor(Hypnotic Tango) was also a minor hit #26.A third single Lovebite was cancelled as the album only reached a dissapointing UK #169.They have had some success around the world and heres hoping that the album,which isnt brilliant but is fairly good for 2 forty-somethings that have been in the same group for 25 years,does well in the USA."
4,They're back!,"Sarah and Keren are back! Bananarama's 9th album DRAMA is easily their best. The singles ""Move In My Direction"" and ""Look On The Floor"" are infectuous and will have you hitting the repeat button and dancing away! The next single is rumored to be ""Feel For You"" which is definately a highlight. The music here is very dancey and disco sounding at some parts. They know how to write good pop songs! Other favorites include ""I Like The Way"", ""Your Love Is Like A Drug"", ""Rules of Attraction"", and more. Welcome back!!"
5,**********,"if america can turn their ears away from the crap they've been listening to, then this cd has a great shot at being succeccfull. the girls have come a hard rough way and they've succeeded. this album if full of modern dance music that is very addictive and fun. ""your love is like a drug', ""move in my direction"" and ""look on the floor"" are huge on sattelite radio and in the clubs. trouble is, no one knows it bananarama. i hope the record company pushes this release. it deserveds to go far. and as a longtime fan, this is the first album since true confessions from '86 that i can listen to ,from begining to end, without cringing."
5,LOVE THIS ALBUM!,"Like many 80's groups, I find that of the groups still recording in the new millenium, I really prefer and appreciate their newer stuff (ie-Erasure, Duran Duran, Boy George, Echo & The Bunnymen, Depeche Mode). Bananarama is no exception to this preference. I absolutely love this album ""Drama"". EVERY TRACK from start to finish and back again. It definately makes my ALL TIME TOP 10 ALBUM LIST. Gone is the bubble gum pop sound that made Bananarama famous in the 80's. In is a new, more sophisticated electronica sound that proves these ladies are all grown up and are making timeless good music (minus the big hair!)."
5,The Best of Bananarama is here,"I totally went out on a limb to purchase this album, as I hadn't heard any of the songs before, but I am very impressed, I made a good decision, probably the song I like least would be 'Middle of Nowhere', 'Your Love Is Like a Drug' would be my favourite song, the rest of the album is cool if you enjoy 80s retro/ pop/dance, so it is a good investment, worth your money. Even as a duo they sound great."
1,"A pretty bad book loaded with ""potty talk""","I usually write reviews on only very good or very bad books. This one is clearly the latter. Gorman is a pretty bad writer, with a plot with a Bates Motel-like ending that is dopey beyond belief. In addition, the two female leads (one is the narrator's sometimes lover) are two of the most obnoxious characters I have read in some time---totally unsympathetic!! Worse than all of that, frankly, is the fact that this author just loves ""potty talk"", in bed, out of bed, wherever!! Every bodily orifice is discussed in detail. The heroine(?) vomits on what seems every few pages. After making love she asks whether she farted all night while she slept, saying she had a flatulence problem. She also said she smelled at the beginning of her menstrual cycle. The narrator described every pee he took, etc., etc. These are not people I would invite over for dinner. What an offputting book Gorman has written!!"
3,I was hoping for a little more,"Being a fan of Clavell's Asian Saga, I looked forward to reading this companion, but it wasn't what I expected. I hoped it would go a little deeper into the stories behind the novels - the true historical events upon which Clavell based his works, his research, and more ""inside scoop"" in general. As it is, the companion is sort of a watered-down Clift-note. It's not bad - the chapter on the Author's life is informative, just not enough detail. Obviously, Macdonald can write and she knows a lot more about writing than I do (she talks about ""thematic issues,"" ""genre conventions,"" and ""deconsruction""), but I wanted to read more about Clavell and the history behind the stories."
