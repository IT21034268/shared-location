1,Disappointing Does Not Say It All,"I thought the book was contrived. It did not have the same charm or flow as the Sookie Stackhouse books. And there is nothing endearing about Aurora. I was pretty bored by page 22. So, I went to the end of the book to see how it ended. After reading the ending, I decided not to read anymore of the Aurora Teagarden books."
3,disappointed,"I enjoyed the book's plot, but I was disappointed to find many factual errors in this book. For example; on p. 160 there is a comment about the famous motives of Tennyson Jessie. F. Tennyson JESSE wrote ""Murder and Its Motives."" On p. 226 Miss Teagarden refers to the author Joe McGuinniss. Joe MCGINNISS wrote crime novels. On the final page Miss Teagarden is referring to intrafamilial poisonings in Croyden, England. That should be Croydon, England."
3,Sample too short,"I may have really enjoyed this book, but I will never know. The sample was less than 3 pages long-maybe 6 paragraphs!This was not enough to decide to buy the book."
3,Not predictable and flows easily,The story was well developed the characters all got a minute or two in the spotlight so you could learn enough about them. It was a quick read and left me satisfied. I immediatly had to go back to the library to get the next book. I rates this a 3 because I did not feel it was AS GOOD as the Harper Connelley or Lilly Bard series that Charlaine Harris writes.
4,Mystery Club,"This was a good mystery! New series for this author and I think it will improve as characters are developed. The star, Roe, was well suited for the story. It starts in a sleepy little town where everyone knows everyone...but then murders start and no one trusts anyone. I do recommend this book for mystery fans...I liked it!"
3,Real Murders,This was an easy read. Maybe the second book in the series will be more interesting than this one. I'm willing to read book 2 in the series and I'll let everyone know what I really think.
3,No sexy vamps here,"Like many other readers, I started reading this book only because I loved Sookie Stackhouse series and was looking to read something along those lines. If (like me) you enjoyed SS series only because of the whole supernatural story, this book is not for you. The rest is pretty much the same as in SS - very light, entertaining story, female main character living an ordinary life until something special happens, etc. If you like mysteries, it is a pleasant read. But for me, a big fan of vampires, it wasn't enough to keep me interested in the series."
3,Avant garde European houses,"The drawings are exactly like the ones in Detail magazine, which means Americans might have occasional trouble translating some of the terminology, but the presentation is top quality. Features cutting-edge designs that are the stuff of architectural journalism: shed roofs, floor-to-ceiling windows, natural wood slat siding, and, my favorite, a house built with two-foot-thick sand-lime brick cavity walls. Not your average homes; then again, no reason to compile them into a book if they were."
3,Liz & Todd,"I must say I love Todd and Liz. I hated Tom, and Sam was't much better. I won't give anything away but if you love Liz and Todd you'll like this book."
2,Elizabeth and Todd yet again? Get over it!,"As I stated in my last review of Sweet Valley University, I am starting to get tired of the series. This book seemed to have clinched it. Must we rehash Elizabeth and Todd again? I don't think so. Next thing you know, she will decide she likes Tom again! I am getting so, so tired of Elizabeth's confusion about her virginity. It seems that the university series is focusing only on her obsession with this. One second, she says she will give it up, the next, it's ""not the right time"". All you SVU readers understand what I am talking about. Can she please just get it over with so we don't have to get so bored with this topic, or stay a virgin, and not talk about it constantly? I have to ask, do these university students actually go to class and worry about important things besides relationships? I'm giving this book two stars, only because the wedding theme was enjoyable."
4,I enjoyed it!,"I liked this book a lot...it did confuse me a lot though, since she and Sam are still arguing and that the book ""Face It"" didn't happen at all. She is also best buds with Jessica again, and nothing seems wrong between the two of them. I really didn't understand where the ""Face It"" book takes place in it at all. Maybe it was more toward the beginning of the summer instead! I don't know, but it still is a good book. I didn't like the ending, grrr! lol! :) But it's worth reading, and I can't wait for the next diary with Jess, and with Sam's, since it'll explain more about the missing links in Liz's diary...hopefully!"
5,read it =),"Elizabeth is always my favorite character of Fracine Pascal's, and I think she belongs with Todd like peanut butter & jelly. Whenever Elizabeth gets with a bad boy like Devon or Conner (Conner's in SVH Senior Year), they just clash real bad. She needs to end up with a stable guy like Todd. =) Any ways, I love this book! Francine Pascal should do more Diaries for SVU. I'm sure Jessica's will be great, too."
2,IM CONFUSED!!!,"Ok... i didnt get this book. It totally changed the history. It said that after Liz and Todd broke up at the begininng of their college years (because she didnt want to lose her virginity), they stopped talking. HUH? Whatever happened to them going out again when Gin Yung was in London? I believe thats talking. They were friends after they broke up that time too. And whatever happened to Sam, Elizabeth, and Jessica? They're ""incident."" It didnt explain anything. Personally.. i thought this book was really dumb and confusing. And not to mention that i always thought Elizabeth and Tom should be together."
3,Liz and Todd Again?,"This book is not one of my more favorite books. The author gets way off track from the previous book. I wish the author would finish what she started with Liz, Jessica, and Sam on the road trip. This storyline was OK, although it was a bit boring."
2,Toddand Liz-Ugh!,I didn't read the whole book but if Todd and Liz end up together again I am going to scream. It's getting old if she just keeps running back to Todd. She needs someone the totally opposite of her.there should be one stable one in a realtionship and one non-stable one. I hope Jessica's diary is better than this one is so far. Jessica's diary should be interesting because they bring Devon Whitelaw back in the scenario.
2,Could have been better . . .,"This book wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I'm tired of the Elizabeth and Todd and Todd and Elizabeth saga. It's too much. I'd rather see Elizabeth go back to Tom or Sam, anyone except Todd. The book was also confusing. You couldn't tell if it was before or after Elizabeth went out with Sam. I also think that the author is focusing too much on Elizabeth losing her virginity. First she thinks Sam is the one (in Face It) now she thinks it's definitely Todd. She doesn't know what she wants. One minute she wants to lose it to Todd the next she doesn't. All I can say is I hope the next book is better."
3,"Boring, and Uneventful","Well this book is very boring, and confusing. This book didn't deal with the issues that happened with Sam, Jessica and Elizabeth. I didn't like the Elizabeth and Todd storyline at all, it was too redundant. The author also kind of changes the history or attitudes of some of the characters such as Jessica, if you read this book you will see what I mean. Another thing that I'm sick of in this series is Elizabeth's rush to lose her virginity. Why is it with every guy that she dates, that she feels that she needs to lose her virginity? Frankly I'm sick of Elizabeth's rush to lose her virginity, why not have her take her time with the relationships, until she becomes more mature? That's what I would prefer to see happen, instead of the constant storylines about her worrying about what guy she should lose it too."
1,Tiger Woods who?,I could not have been more disappointed with this game. I have played Links golf since about 1998 and it is way better than this one. I really expected the game format and graphics to be much better.I recommend you save your money for a real round of golf.
1,Won't fly here in the heart land,"I guess it is my own fault for not investigating the actual recipes in the book, but I thought there would be standard ""diet"" food fare utilized in a 1,200 calorie a day format. Not so much. The book DOES deliver 1,200 calorie a day recipes it's just that none of them seem appetizing or practical. I perused it and quickly relegated it to my yard sale box of books. I mean how practical is ""Wild Rice-Sausage Chowder and Fresh Tomato Slices""? There are 16 ingredients listed! Someone who can whip up a 16 ingredient dish doesn't need help putting together a 1,200 calorie day. Here is one that looks inviting...""Individual fruit platters with hot popovers"" Oh wait, I don't want to whip up popovers! I wanted something to help me get OUT of the kitchen and grocery store. Sort of like a do-it-yourself Jenny Craig plan. If anyone knows of such a thing, please post it for me."
3,1200 Calorie Menu,"I really like this concept, that no matter what you make it is a 1200 calorie day. That said, there is no room for snacks because all 3 meals are suppose to equal 1200 calories. Some of the breakfast and lunch were not feasible simply because of my work schedule. The recipes I have tried have been tasty and easy to make. I do wish that they were easier to cut down since I am only cooking for 1 and all the recipes are for 4."
1,Too complicated ...not what I was expecting.,"I was hoping to have a full menu but this book splits it up on different sections, etc. Also, the recipies are way too complicated, nothing you would cook every day, unless you don't work. Waste of money."
2,"Not ""Quick and Easy""","Don't buy this unless you have a lot of time available for meal prep and are okay with 15+ ingredients per recipe. Also, the nutritional info is skimpier than what's provided by some cookbooks; she gives you the calorie and fat-gram counts, but that's it - no saturated fat, trans fat, or sodium numbers. That said, there are some good 100-calorie dessert recipes, and a few of the others worked for me too. I guess I got my money's worth, but the cover says ""Quick and Easy Recipes,"" and that they are not."
3,"Nice, Ideas","Very good ideas for breakfast, but the other recipes take a lot of time and effort most people do not have. I did pick a few of the breakfasts out and tried them on my family, they loved them."
2,Food Substitutes,"In order to keep the meals low-calorie/low-fat I found that many of the recipes call for ingredients that are processed and artificial such as butter sprays and butter seasonings, light margarine, non-fat cheese and other diary, turkey ""meats"" and egg substitutes etc. These are ideas that I could have come up with on my own, just switching high-fat ingredients to low-fat alternatives in any regular recipe. I guess I was looking for more of an inspired attempt and a healthier way to cook low-calorie. Also, there are no photographs."
2,"Takes too many ingredients, too much time. No everyday meals","I was hoping to find a cookbook that would have quick, easy to fix recipes but what I found were recipes that require a lot of special ingredients and a lot of time to make them. They may be good recipes but I don't have the time or money to fix them so I'll never know."
4,Pretty nice idea,"I like the format of this cookbook, but I haven't gotten to try any of the recipes. I'm looking for simple recipes to use what I have on hand at the moment. It's layout is very well thought out and it's easy to understand the nutritional data."
5,Easy and delicious,"I love this cookbook. I've been using it for about a month and so far we've liked every recipe. Usually recipes in diet cookbooks are so boring. I like that you can pick any breakfast, lunch, dinner or dessert and still get 1200 calories without thinking about it."
3,Some different recipes,I am always looking for new low-calorie recipes and I found 4 additions to my collection in this book. Every new recipe and change in ingredients is most welcome.
2,"Seems Good, but Isn't...","I thought this cookbook was going to be great to help me eat 1200 calories a day. Unfortunately, the recipes in this book are so unusual for lunch and dinner that I didn't even attempt them. If you're cooking just for yourself, it's probably fine, but don't expect your family to like dappling in recipes such as rolled ham with cream cheese and sweet red poppy fruit-lettuce platter.I'm glad that I bought the American Heart Association Low-Calorie Cookbook: More than 200 Delicious Recipes for Healthy Eating. You can still manage your 1200 calorie diet using this book and the recipes are much more down to earth than this cookbook. You can read my review on that cookbook to get a better idea of what you can make for a meer 300-400 calories a meal. PLUS DESSERT!!!"
5,First rate drill.,"Boy this drill just takes what ever you can dish out to it and laughs. I have worked it hard over the time that I owned it and had no problems at all. The battey life is good, and in my opinion about the same as other drills of its size. You have one pack in the charger and the other in the drill and all will be fine. It is of solid construction and a high quality of finish (as most DeWalt tools). The keyless ratcheting chuck works well. While they do not give them away, I think for the money you get a very good quality item that will out perform others in its class."
5,Reliable powerhouse with great battery life,"I've had this drill for about 8 months now and used it in a variety of settings for all sorts of purposes. I am amazed at how long the batteries hold a charge, and how they seem to be immune from even subfreezing temperature. I left it outside on the porch after finishing a project; the temperature fluctuated between upper teens and low 30's for the week it went unfound. I brought it in, thinking the battery was dead, and went to get the other. Out of curiosity I pulled the trigger and it was immediately at full speed. Without changing batteries I took it to the shop and used it over the next several hours with not a whimper. I am impressed. The smaller size and lighter weight make it a dream to use. I'm not convinced that the lack of ""XRP"" on the batteries make any detectable difference at all. The price is steep at ""street list"" and I've seen them go for much less, so be patient."
5,Indestructable,"I have had one of these for several years and it is my most reliable possession! I dropped it off a roof and onto the driveway and I thought... oh ..., there goes ... down the drain. I picked it up, slapped the battery pack back in and to my suprise, went right back to work! --Bulletproof"
5,An Hour with a Master Teacher,"This DVD is like spending an hour with a master teacher looking at all the tiny mechanical details of Sanchin. You won't find a lot of gee-whiz martial arts here. What you will find are enough clearly described details to give you something to chew on for months. This is a dvd for people who strive for body control, mastery of every aspect of their kata. It's clear enough for beginners, but I've gotten several good insights from it, too, and I've been doing Sanchin for 17 years now.Kudos, by the way, to the production team. This is a nicely filmed, professional dvd with well-chosen camera angles and clear sound.Susan Lynn Petersonauthor of Western Herbs for Martial Artists and Contact Athletes"
4,an excellent instructional DVD,I really like this video. it's definitely the most technical kata video that I've ever watched and makes some very interesting points about generating power in Goju Ryu. I found the video to be very insightful and an excellent addition to my karate library.
4,Definitely worth Buying!,"Obviously different videos from different Master vary. This DVD was very intuitive, well thought out, and organized. The Material was excellent; and the formant made it very easy to digest. You can go back and select the specific areas that you want to review, and or work on. It should definitely be a part of any Classical Karate Practitioner's library. At this point I buy everything this Author produces."
4,It's All In Sanchin,"This DVD covers Sanchin literally from head to toe. The instructor teaches the Goju-ryu style but the concepts are universal to other styles. As anyone who practices Sanchin knows, Sanchin is the beginning and the end, it is all contained in this one kata. The detailed contained in this video is impressive. I enjoyed Sensei Wilder's introduction and history of Sanchin. My only minor complaint is that he didn't spend a few more minutes on the all important breathing even though the focus is really on the stance. I haven't read the companion book but maybe the breathing is explained there. Nonetheless, overall this is a quality production which merits repeated viewing. I would not hesitate in recommending this to any serious student of Okinawan karate."
1,Major Disappointment,"I picked this up for my Labradoodle since I like his hair shorter. It seemed like a good idea but the first time I used it the clipper overheated so much so that I burned myself. By taking breaks to let the buzzer cool down and by just dealing with the heat I got my dog's hair cut and it did a great job, but every time since it seems to work less and less efficiently. It was taking longer and longer to cut his hair and it was less and less even a cut. Not only that but it makes a popping noise that scares my dog when I am cutting his hair. I think I have only used it five times and it has totally stopped working. Don't buy this - it's a major waste of money."
5,Worth every penny!!,"I purchased this kit a few months ago for my 7lb Maltese. It has lots of power to get the job done and never heats up were I can't hold on to it. I agree, the DVD is out dated, but it has some good tips. The scissors are a plus too; I use them to trim around her paws, ears and chin.Overall, I love the money I'm saving doing it myself."
2,Not as good as it used to be.,I bought this product before and it was great. After several uses my dog knocked my first one out of my had and it broke into a thousand pieces on the cement floor. I was so happy with that one that I immediatly ordered another. Sorry to say that the second one was not near as good as the first.It took me 20 minutes just to cut my dogs head. I got so aggrivated that I went out in the pouring rain just to pick up another clipper at the local pet shop.
3,Just OKAY,It cut hair but wasnt easy. I have used top of the line animal clippers before and this is nothing compaired to those. You get what you pay for. These are just regular clippers that werent just made for animal grooming. The only difference from these and human clippers is the Paw Print on them....
1,Pet Grooming Kit,"I bought this item a few months ago, and have used it 3 times. I found it to be very disappointing. It is no better at cutting my dogs hair (I have two)than my personal clippers. It is painfully slow, and my animals get very impatient with the time it takes. I would not recommend this item, and I am sorry I bought it."
1,DVD appears to be amateur copy from VHS tape...,"Very bad quality DVD; Labels on CD and Package appear to be ""home made""; Returned product to Seller (""importcds"") and so far, did not hear from them nor was I reimbursed (nearly 2 months after product arrived returned at their facility).Regret that this otherwise positively ranked seller does not step up to the issue. The following note went to the seller.Dear Import CDs:I returned above mention DVD and still have not received the credit of ""$15.60"" to my credit card.I ordered via Amazon the DVD ""MEN"" as indicated in above order number. The DVD turned out to be a cheap bootleg, possibly taped directly from TV or VHS (judging from the picture quality) and voice synchronized by amateurs. I expected an original DVD. The DVD arrived as a return at your facility in Irvine, CA on 10/30/09 according to USPS tracking."
2,Poor quality DVD - still a great movie,"The movie itself is great. I saw it a long time ago on VHS. I was hoping that this just released DVD would give me a high quality version of my old VHS tape and was very disappointed. For one, it is only in English, there is no choice of selecting the original language. The quality is not any better than the VHS tape I have had for over 15 years. To be fair, nowhere did the product description state that it had been digitally remastered or that the original language was available, however, in this day and time, one expects that of just released DVD's, even if the product description does not mention it.That being said, the movie itself is still great, loved it, very funny."
1,"The story and film is great, the DVD quality is beyond poor","I returned this DVD, by importcds - this is not a commercially made product by DVD quality standards, but home made, and poor at that - I can do a better VHS transfer at home. But the film is wonderful."
1,NOT the screwball romantic comedy it claims,"This was a long, boring and tedious German movie. I can't figure out exactly what the deeper premise was, but it was not funny, not interesting, long-winded, and plain ole boring. Yes, sometime MEN can be boring! ...Rizzo"
2,ugh,"Contrary to what others have expressed, I found Men to be slow moving and rather dull, with the dialogue tending to be forced and overly random. While admirable performances by Uwe Ochsenknecht and Heiner Lauterbach save this flick from a 1-star, I must say that this Komödie lives up to the stereotypical opinion of German comedy...where's comedy?"
1,Not off to a good start,"Out of the twenty or so I've used so far, a large portion of them were so compressed that each glove is stuck fast together. Meaning you really have to work just to get them open so you can stick your hand in. It's time consuming and frustrating, to the point where I'm tossing stuck ones instead of using them. Those that do work, work fine; they seem fairly resistant to my pet peeve with these style gloves - the fingertips tearing off. I think if they had just packed them into a larger box, they wouldn't have had this problem and I would've rated them better. But my next box will not be these."
1,Quality failure,"This is the 3rd box of these gloves I've purchased. The quality has tanked!! I used nearly half the box replacing a water pump.I'll bet they make a lot more money, but the product now stinks!!!"
3,Good Glove Overall,"I,ve only used these glove once since my purchase, and they seem to indure a bit better than some of the other name brands.The Con: the size ""large"" actually fits like a size mediume."
5,Thicker than Advanced Tool Design gloves,"Comparing them side by side, the size large Gator Skin is thicker than the advanced tool design gloves. However, the size large runs a little smaller. I prefer the Gator Skin gloves."
1,"Weak, easily torn, waste of money","I bought these gloves to be used specifically for what they're made for: automotive work. Unfortunately, these gloves really don't live up to their claim of being strong or tear-resistant. These gloves tear so easily that in one full day's work of changing brakes and doing some other work on my car I went through 4 pairs. Look elsewhere if you plan to use these gloves for automotive work."
2,Maybe half were usable,"Gloves we ok once you get them on. Too many tore at the wrist when putting on, or were so compressed that you couldn't get the things on. I've had several boxes of Advanced Tool Design Model ATD-6998 and they are much better quality."
1,REALLY ROTTEN GLOVES,"This product is undoubtedly the WORST product ever received. The first three gloves tore when putting them on, the next got on by putting powder inside,but tore upon removal. Looking at the next one before even trying to put it on holes were obvious between the fingers. As these gloves are obviously rotten how are they supposed to protect my hands from anything? I don't suppose I can even return them as the box is opened, so will just have to eat the price and look elsewhere for a product that will hopefully give me some relief. 11-20-08"
1,"Poor quality, tear easily","These gloves are horrible. The fingertips tips split open after little use and several have split open on the side. It takes three or four pair to get though most tasks. They fit me properly and I'm using them for light duty work: cleaning guns; painting; sanding; etc. I have half of a box left and I'm going to toss them as soon as I get another brand. Avoid the GatorSkin nitrile gloves, they are a waste of money."
1,"UGH! Painful, Long and Boring","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie with Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock both attached to this project. Sadly, it is not was horrible movie was an annoying main character, Oskar, a spoiled brat who I in no way cared about or could relate with.The movie is long, boring and drags out with no redeeming moral at the end, which I was hoping for and pretty much the only reason I finished watching. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are not in the movie enough and the fact that 9/11 is a back drop for the plot doesn't save this story either. Don't waste two hours of your life watching this when there are so many other movies out there."
2,not a good movie,"my goodness! With such an aweful event tht occured in our country, you'd expect a real blockbuster quality movie.The kid had to act out his mental issues!!? Storyline really sucked. Give me a break about the kid doing a goodjob! acomplete over the top in his acting."
2,I quit half way through it,"It doesn't happen often but I decided to quit watching this movie halfway through it maybe one day I'll revisit it but I doubt it.(I stopped immediately after the scene at the lock manufacture which was suppose to be a very powerful moment). The young actor, Thomas Horn is excruciatingly terrible, yes I understand what he was attempting to capture, but it failed miserably and just destroyed any credibility of realism I have in this character. Sorry Thomas, and I think you know this already by the lack of work you had since 2010, acting is not your strong suit."
3,Not a fan of Tom Hanks but the boy was great,"The story brought back a lot of memories. It made you realize how alone people were after just one day of terror.This is a good story between a boy, father and mom that tells you people really are stronger than you think."
3,Pretty good,"Pretty good movie. It just didn't stick in my memory or change my life like the critics were saying in the previews. Lol. I actually forgot all about it until I was reminded that I saw it in a preview. It is a nice story, though, with really good and experienced actors and actresses."
2,Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close,"Plot: When Oskar's dad passes away in the 9/11 terrorest attack, oskar finds a key in his dad's closet and he sets out on a journey to find out what the key fits and is acompanyed by a mute old guy.My Oppinoin: The story is good but the movie is slow and boring and Oskar is annoying. this is just a horrible movie. tom hanks was the only actor outside sandra bullock that caught my attention. but all in all this movie is boring. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't"
2,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"I watched the movie on my flight to Washington, so it had all of my attention. I found it hard to follow and not at all what I thought it would be. I guess just like alot of movies the best parts are in arthe previews. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are hardly in the movie, I would have liked to see more of their characters."
5,Brilliant!,"I waited what seemed like forever to see this. It was well worth the rental. I couldn't believe that the kid had never been in a film before. His portrayal of a kid with mental health issues and the loss of a father was so intense to watch. At first I we so irritated by his behavior then when he stated what was happening in his head, it was obvious. Simple put a beautiful rendation on trauma and recovery. I hope students study this in college."
5,Beautiful Movie!,I rented this movie with some trepidation. I read the book several years ago and it was one of my all-time favorites. I was afraid (especially with the negative reviews here on Amazon) that it would not only fall below my expectations but it would ruin the beautiful story I remember from the book. I was so wrong. This was a great movie!
1,The worst movie I ever seen,When I saw this movie I had no idea how bad this movie is but boy I was wrong very wrong and all I could say this movie is extremely bad on every level and mainly goes to the little kid who is very disturbing and somewhat of a sociopath plus to add insult the father and the grandfather played by Tom hanks and Max Von Sydow should be ashamed for starring in rotten turd of a movie. Don't buy this movie in other words.
1,"Love the Cast, Hate the Movie","If you've had the unfortunate experience of sitting through the 9/11 sapfest ELAIC, I'm sorry. It's the film that proves that if you add Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock to anything, you will get an Oscar nomination. I expect next year there will be a two-hour movie where Meryl Streep simply reads from the phone book with a foreign accent and the Academy will honor that too. It's utterly disgusting, but reinforces the old saying ""it's not about what you know, but who you know.""Telling a story of a child on an unrealistic journey through the streets of NYC, bad parenting is really the only impression I was left with during this overlong exercise in patience. Using 9/11 is disgusting, and was used as a way to sell tickets. Maybe the book is better, I didn't read it - and now I have no plan to. This is the worst movie to ever get nominated for best picture - but if you like it, watch the equally awful (and similar)Grace Is Gone."
1,Great cast-HORRIBLE movie!,I saw this in the Theater and I wanted my money back in the 1st 20 minutes. It is so weird and odd. They trick ya into seeing it by having Hanks and Bullock in the film. It makes you cry over and over. I usually enjoy and fall in love with movies that make me cry and feel. This movie made me fell like going to the manager and asking for my money back! =(
1,Extremely S***ty and Incredibly Manipulative,"What did 9/11 have to do with anything in this movie? What if the dad died in a car accident, wouldn't the plot be the same exact thing? The fact that Danny Leigh said that people should watch the Human Centipede 2 over this shows just how blatantly manipulative this tripe is."
3,it was okay,It wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be.The ending was a surprise. Was another surprise too.The boy did a very nice job in his first acting appearance.
2,Not what I expected,"I was so looking forward to this movie, but it was not at all what I expected! Taught me to wait to order until I can pre-view it on cable if I am not sure. Great cast, but VERY disjointed."
2,Hard movie to get into.,Didn't expect this type of movie. My husband was completely bored.It was a hard movie to follow and not fall asleep.
1,Incredibly long and boring,Saw this in the theatre. Never saw an audience stunned into silence by a bad movie. And Sandra Bullock & Tom Hanks have a total of 20 minutes in it. Don't waste your time.
1,Absolute garbage,"With such an important event in history, I would have expected something much, much better than this. By far and large the worst movie I have ever watched, if you can call it a movie. I can't understand Sandra Bullock and Tom hanks putting their names to this albeit for the money they were paid. If anyone remotely likes this ""movie"" I can only suggest you must be related to the director or so called story line writer. It doesn't get any sort of rating from me apart from it actually being worse than The New World. Maybe being Australian I have missed something or I'm not a certain part of the ""field"". I mean, I dislike Red Dog which is an Aussie movie and supposed to be a smash hit. For me, the three worst movies I have seen this year and in order are Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, The New World and Red Dog.I have at least learnt now to see the movie first before buying it.They're kidding.Stewart,Australia. 17-08-12"
2,Ok,I personally thought that it was not that great. I thought it was too long. I just watched this movie last night was very mad. being a child that lost hid dad in 9/11 I naturally wanted to see it. But was disappointed that it wasnt about 9/11 at all. The kid that acted in this movie is one of the best actors I've ever seen though.
1,Not worth your time,"Awful movie! Goes nowhere fast, every opportunity to make this a good movie is squandered! A complete waste of my time!"
2,The only good ting about this movie is Sandra Bullock,"Sandra Bullock and tom Hanks out act the rest of the cast. This makes you watch the movie yearning for more Sandra and Tom. Besides the kid is written just way too weird!Don't waste your time, buy Flight 93, it is the best made regarding that September day."
4,Worth having - and certainly worth renting,"I truly enjoyed this. While scared away from the book that the movie was based on, I thought the movie was nicely done and very moving."
3,Sad but Irritating at the same time,"I found the little boys character to be a little hard to believe. This is coming from someone who is compulsive and struggles with anxiety and panic. Even then, I thought it was a little stressful to watch. The movie is very touching, but be prepared to be very sad. The ending just left me feeling MORE sad. So it wasn't really a feel good kind of movie :) Which I doubt you are expecting it to be."
2,Not for me,"I didnt hate this movie. I just thought it was going to be very different. Terribly sad. The acting is excellent, but I just felt like its not a movie for me. Maybe its too deep or whatever, but its not for me."
3,"Well Done, but Not Great","In many ways this movie succeeds. It creates a sophisticated and often moving portrayal of a precocious and anxious boy, whose dad's died during 9/11. The problems come in more at the margins. For instance, the Dad is a bit too perfect and the adventures/quest he takes on is largely implausible--or at least unrealistic. That said, those can be lived with; this is fiction after all. But I think my biggest problems came from the child actor. Overall, he was very impressive. His performance was nuanced and sophisticated, but there were still times when it didn't quite work. When his acting felt wooden. And those moments combined with the other two issues just mentioned, detracted a bit too much for me. That said, I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it."
1,Extremely Loud & and Incredibly Close,Long and boring pretty much sums it up. It was a rip off exploiting big star names and a national tragedy to entice viewers into watching a movie that was LONG AND BORING. Do Sandra and Tom need money that much?
2,Good enough story...ruined by a boy...,"Could they SERIOUSLY not have gotten a real actor to play the lead boy in this film?Is there someone in the movie company this kid is related to?HOW did he get this job? I've never been more annoyed by a child in my entire life except for the baby in Morton's the other night whose parents would not take him out while he cried and cried over our one quiet night my wife and I get out together perhaps in every 3-6 months...Back to the movie: IF and only IF the right casting had been done, the rest of the ensemble was good to near perfect, especially Bullock.But, because of the poor choice of lead, it is near unwatchable...I made it through, but I was suffering all the way and I'll never do it again."
2,The young boy,"So much expectation for this potentially heart-felt theme, but even bigger let down when this young boy carries the adult theme that is not very engaging. Then there's the narration. Too much talking by this boy becomes overwrought. As usual, Viola Davis is superb."
5,Loved this movie! Period. .,Great acting from all actors; Original screenplay with meaningful story line-nice development of plot. Plus the special features are also relevant & interesting.
3,Extremely Emotional,"I just got through watching ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"". It was an extremely well done movie, that was definitely moving, occasionally funny, and left me with a gut wrenching depression that does not want to go away. I still remember 9/11, vividly, and perhaps I will never be able to watch a movie that brings up the horror of that day as well as this one did!"
4,Very Good,"This movie was very interesting. It was also very sad. I cried several times at the horror of what this family (and all the others) went through. But it was an intriguing tale of a young boy trying to reconcile the death of his father, his own grief and knowledge of the events, and his new relationship with his mother. The boy is smart and unique and the parents are also very creative and caring. The tale is quite beautiful and ends on a high note. It was a little slow moving, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would suggest this to others as well."
3,Great Acting but Painful to Watch,"Since others have reviewed the storyline and content, I will omit most of that here. I thought 10 years would be enough time for me to watch a movie about the 9/11 attacks...but it wasn't. To explain, the young actor is exceptional, which makes his heartache and despair very painful to watch, especially in the last 30 minutes of this movie. If you were too young to remember 9/11, this may be a good movie to see and understand the emotions of those who lost a parent or loved one in the 9/11 attack. But because I wish my wounds to stay healed, and the fact that I wish I had never watched it, I can't recommend it."
2,maudlin maudlin.... maudlin,using 911 as the only premise. the screenwriter had nothing more to add after the opening description of hanks and the good young actor.would he really knock on all those black surname doors?just such an abuse of credulity in the screenplay. bad choice by Mr. Hanks.
3,"Not sure why, but a let down.","While this has all the aspects of a great movie, for some reason it's just not. It's boring and slow to develop. When the story does develop it is a bit of a let down."
3,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,It was a very interesting movie about a young child and his reaction to 9/11. This is the first I had seen about how a child reacted to this tragedy.
3,Love the actors,"I rarely like the movie better than the book, but this was one of those times. It was easier to follow and while the performances of all involved was good, I guess the subject matter made it difficult for me to enjoy it. I didn't know 9/11 has impacted me that much."
3,Good but not great.,"I found that this movie was entertaining enough to watch all the way through. It was even touching at times but overall it felt contrived, not quite believable."
3,Poor reception and as a result found it dull.,I found this film hard to follow. It could be that the reception from Amazon streaming was poor so I had pauses intermittantly. I may watch it again to see if I like it but will wait until it is on a premimum channel.
4,really good film,"if you like the shows ""touch"" or ""six degrees"" then this movie shouldn't disappoint you. if you have no idea, but like real life with a twist, this is a winner."
2,the story is not even interesting,"YuckI kept waiting for something interesting to happen.Well, it didn't.Not such an interesting story.i wanted to know about Dresden, the grandfather and grandmother's relationship."
3,Two huge actors with limited roles,I liked the movie but wish Tom was more involved. the boys search was quite interesting to say the least.
3,Good and Bad,"The acting by the boy in this movie is excellent. He should have been nominated for an Academy Award...he was that good. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock have rather small roles...but they did a great job.I think the obvious tragedy of this movie is the father dying in the 9/11 attacks. I think, the other tragedy was this boy needed help and a TEAM of professionals to ease his life.I found it incredible that at any hour of the day or night he would just go where he wanted to go and do what he wanted to do.Towards the end...we see a new side to the story but still to allow this to go on...in this world...is bad parenting.It was a sad movie about a sad story. The young boy saves the movie from a 1 star rating."
3,Not that great,The story was long and mostly boring. I like Sandra so that was the only reason I watched it at all.
4,Extremely Lound and Incredibly Close,I took a while to warm up to this film. But it was and enjoyable film with a surprise ending. Well worth the watch
1,Rough to Watch,"Had I not rented this movie in a hotel room, for a ridiculous price, I would have walked out. This was simply painful to watch. A story that revolved around a truly disturbed, precocious, rude, neurotic child who also happened to be grieving due to his loss of his father 9/11. The ending was the most watchable part. Horrible flick. (and I love Tom Hanks!)"
1,Extremely Long & Incredibly Boring!!,"Love Tom Hanks, but I nodded out a few times, I could not finish the movie and after watching the trailer wanted to like it but was extremely disappointed."
1,UGH,"I had high hopes for this movie because of the back story of the twin towers but oh my goodness....the son who is the main focus was obnoxious. I am so glad my children are not like that! He had special needs, having a borderline autism diagnosis but my child with special needs never behaved so selfishly and annoying. The poor mother...so sad because she lost her spouse and to top it off she is abused by her son. Watch TOUCH with Keifer Sutherland instead....so much better!! The only thing that made this movie good was Max von Sydow and Viola Davis.Touch: Season One"
3,Good or Bad? Listen and Choose!,"Punk Debutante could be best described as really cheesy dance music. I first heard Cooler Kids' ""All Around The World"" while listening to a net radio station. The song was catchy so I just had to buy the album. None of the other songs stood out as AATW, but they weren't that bad. I personally would not recommend this album to anyone. I mean, I listen to it on occassion but only when I want something to dance to or just to have something playing while driving. The music's fun but not to be taken seriously."
1,What a rip off!,I can't believe I just spent $5.95 to read 4 short paragraphs! Less information than I've already read in the Times. Save your money
3,Something i want to add,"It si amezing that this particular music ixists yet, i never imaginete that i could find anything like this in a unknow web page, but the matter of fact is that here are the best of best what is consern in music in a high level."
5,Beautiful Cookbook,"This is a great cookbook, the recipes are wonderful and I love the variations from different countries. Not only a well organized, practical vegetarian cookbook but a history lesson as well"
5,A vegetarian world cuisine cookbook & history lesson,"This is the best cookbook I've ever read or owned! The recipes are straightforward and delicious - with few hard-to-find ingredients or very labor-intensive processes. And while I've tried and enjoyed several of the recipes Rabbi Gil Marks includes, every time I open the book, I feel I am learning more about the ways ethnic cuisines morph as they are carried from one region or culture into another, and hugely fascinating background information about Jewish diaspora history as well."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time On This One,"This should barely be considered a documentary. Its more a series of trailers put together as some sort of a give away promo video from low-rent video label Front Row Entertainment. Probably a loose video from a Horror genre box set. Front Row is a company notorious for putting out some of the worst movies in a really cheap quality releases. This is a EP mode video that doesn't even run 30mins if I remember correctly. One might expect from the title that this is some sort of tribute compilation video like the ones that Hammer Horrors studios had done for them on each specific genre. However, this is nothing of the sort. You'll get some scenes from Steven King movies haphazardly strung together and shown in really poor quality. There are no interviews with Stephen King nor any narration. If you're looking for something on Stephen King definitely look elsewhere"
3,Handy Bits,"This product was purchased for casual use in a non-industrial environment.Though this product bears the Dewalt name, the quality of the package is lacking. Small Phillips bits round easily and large ones shattered with as low as setting 8-9 into pine & fir.This set would be better offering a snap in chuck to use professional grade drill bits, rather than the 'instant-dull' bits included with this set."
2,"Cute, but questionable quality.","The bits are lubricated, making me believe they will get rusty with use.Believe it or not, the set is made of 30 pieces, but 9 of them are the same #2 Philips bit. Why? Maybe because the dubious quality.The hex base of the drils are poorly finished.The box is great although the quick loader chuck doesn't fit inside it. Maybe the best part of this Set."
3,the rapid load is not the 1/4 adapter for driver set,"I'm disappointed that the rapid load adapter is not the 1/4 end where I can use it for my driver/impact set from Dewalt.Also, the rapid load adapter can't fit in the case. That was not too smart to create a case that does not fit the adapter as shown in the picture. I have to find another place to store it now :("
3,"Good Set, Lame Case","Ok, items in the set are a good to have around the shop and working around the house. However, I was quite miffed when the set arrived and I couldn't fit the Rapid Load chuck into the case the comes with the kit. Dewalt seems to have missed the KISS boat when it came to this product. Why doesn't the integral piece of gear(Rapid Load chuck) fit into the kit? I guess the engineers designed this one early on a Monday morning!"
5,great value,"this set offers many of the bits that u need for the around the house tasks, probably wouldnt suit the contracter, but for the handyman it is great."
4,A nice one,"Doungeon Keeper 2 is a major improvement from the first one. For those who are not familiar with this series, you play an evil Dungeon Master, building a dungeon and sponsoring the monsters who come and settle, create traps and fill it with treasures. Then, you wait for the unlucky adventurers who come and try to rob the dungeon and kill the monsters. If you did your work right, they will die in the process and you will get their treasures.Dungeon Master 2 implements better graphics from it's prequel. It also offers many more options to the player in the fields of monsters, traps, dungeon rooms, etc.The only fault I was able to find in this game is the fact that it's a bit old today.Overall, 4 stars for most gamers. 5 stars for classical gamers."
3,Grainy Video,It would be better if Blueray is available. Audio is acceptable. Packaging not to my expectation. It could have been better.
3,A decent beginner's book on the subject,"This was the first book I bought on Moringa. I found it to have some decent information and photos. I found that if your looking for a bunch of Moringa Leaf recipes this book has many, at the same time it has too many."
4,Comments on Moringa book,"Good information, but would like to see a bit more detail about research. It did provide good basic information about Moringa."
3,"Moringa, Nature's Medicine Cabinet","A quick read, could have contained more in-depth info on the benifits of consuming moringa products. I would recommend this book."
3,Work better on larger babies,"Update: we've had more success as baby grows. I'd say these are best for about 15lbs.I didn't look at the dates on these reviews, but wish I had. Kushies aren't bad, but they don't even compare to the latest diapering systems.Pros:All in one. No folding, stuffing, etc.Relatively inexpensive for a cloth diaper.Cons:Poor fit. Very very narrow in the crotch, very long. (my 11 week old is about 11lbs & the crotch is barely big enough to cover her. The front comes up past her navel.)Because of the fit, lots of leaks--straight out the sides.Takes FOREVER to dry--in the dryer, over an hour & still damp in the center. 80deg sunny day outside longer than a bath towel on the line. Inside drying rack, don't bother--12 hrs still damp."
1,Too heavy and thick,"I purchased a package after reading all the reviews. However, I was very disappointed after receiving the package. The diapers are very heavy, thick, and inflexible. My baby hated putting them on. He screams while trying to take them off. (He is only 7 months old). He calmed down right after I took off the diaper. We are living in a very humid environment and this diaper doesn't fit the weather at all. Also it is so bulky and difficult to dry. Buy some light ones...I tried the Thirsties...and my baby seems like it better."
3,OK as back-up diapers,"I have been cloth diapering my 9 month old son since the day he was born. I did a lot of research on cloth diapers and have spent a lot of money on them... my son hit some serious growth spurts and we went through four sets of diapers by the time he was five months! During one of these growth spurts, I realized that I really didn't have enough diapers (and I dreaded spending any more money) so I purchased a pack of the Kushies All In Ones. They are definitely cost effective, which is great. The All In One feature is nice for laundering but I found them too bulky (I had difficulty fitting his clothes over them) and they never fit properly around my son's waist and legs causing leaks. They aren't terribly absorbant... one good pee and then they're done!In my experience, they are OK diapers. If you want something more absobant that keeps the moisture off of your baby's skin, look for Fuzzi Bunz with hemp inserts - they are awesome!"
3,Diapers Kinda Bulky: There Are Better Cloth Diapers,"While it's nice to have an all-in-one diaper, these kind of diapers are the reason people think of cloth diapers as bulky. It's just like the old days: heavy cotton with a plastic-y covering. I had some on my registry just because they were the only ones offered at Babies R Us. I wouldn't buy them again. I received Fuzzi Bunz in the mail a few days later, and they're HEAVEN in comparison. (Soft, light, and only $4 more per diaper: I'm willing to do that for my baby!)"
3,not my favorite cloth diaper,"These were the first all-in-ones I got, and I only registered for them because they were easy to buy for the less web-savvy. But, I have since gotten Bumkins aio's and LOVE them. The Kushies' covers break down way too quickly and they are really bulky in the crotch area. After 5 months of use in rotation with second-hand Bumkins aio's and snugglebottoms contours (in other words, they aren't even taking the full brunt of the washing and drying) all ten of my brand-new Kushies have tears in the cover. One thing I can say for these and all of my cloth diapers, though: no diaper rash."
3,OK product,"I got these for my newborn. They work fairly well. I like not having to use a diaper cover, but it really needs more absorbant layers in it. The soaker pad doesn't really do any good, but the flannel works pretty well. If you use a insert pad it really beefs up the absorbancy. I would buy these again, but I definatly prefer bumkins all in ones."
2,Very bulky diaper,"This diaper is so bulky that most of my one year old's pants do not fit over them. They also seem to make her walk funny. I was sold on the great price and good reviews, but I feel like I wasted money and now I still have to go and buy the more expensive diapers.On a positive note, they do hold a lot of wetness and seem to dry faster in the dryer than other AIO's."
5,Product takes the fear out of cloth diapers,"We started using cloth since the baby was developing a diaper rash (at about 3 months). The first ones we tried were the Kushies prefolds and diaper wrap combo. It worked great and he's not had a rash since. Then we bought the all-in-ones and it's been better!! It is easy to wash and the all-in-one is so easy to put on the baby. None of our friends used cloth diapers but we've discovered that using cloth diapers is not that more complicated than having to pack everyone in the car and go to Costco or the grocery store and buy disposable diapers. I recently returned to work, the baby started using disposable diapers at daycare - but in the evenings and weekends, we continue to use the kushies diapers. This is still helping us save money and we're very satisfied with the product."
3,Not crazy about these,"I haven't washed them yet, but they seem really bulky for my slender little guy. They're very stiff, too, which I hope will change when I've prepped them, but I'm not very hopeful.Update:So I've added two stars, now that I've finally washed and used these a couple times. They did soften up a bit, and now that my baby is in the middle of the weight range (10-22lbs, if I remember correctly) they aren't so bulky. He wore one for naptime, and I was pleased to find afterward that no leaks had sprung. Still not my favorite, and still stiffer than other cloth all-in-ones and pocket diapers I have."
2,Not a good option for an AIO diaper,"These diapers are a lot of trouble when it comes laundry time. They have to be fastened inside out in order to really get them clean, it takes forever to get them dry at least an hour maybe more, and when they are dry you have to work them back into shape before using them again. They are the least expensive AIO diaper, but I would definitely recommend paying more for a better diaper."
1,Poop Leaks,"Our baby is 8 weeks old, and every time we've had a poop leak, it's been with these diapers. All our other cloth diapers are separate diaper and cover, so I can't say whether the problem is the Kushies AIOs, or AIOs in general. But, whichever it is, a poop leak is a poop leak, and I do NOT recommend these diapers. We've stopped using ours completely. We've been happy with Kissaluvs diapers with Bummis wraps."
1,ugh...just ugh!!,"no diapers seem to work for my baby toby! I have tried everything imaginible to the point where I was just about to give up on diapers for him, ya know? just let him go naked. Well I brought these home and they gave my baby toby these terrible rash's all over his face even though I didn't even put them on his face and I had rubbed plants all over his face to feed him...but ya know what I give UP!!!"
1,Never Dry,"I hate these. The ""all-in-one"" thing sounds great, but because they are so thick I have to run them through the dryer at least twice on the normal heat setting. (The instructions recommend using the low heat setting, but they never dry that way!) For this reason they are not cost effective at all. The disposables hold MUCH more without leaking. I use cloth diapers, liners and covers that will wash and dry separately. It's just as easy to use as these, and they dry much better."
1,Very Leaky,"We got these at a recommendation from a couple in our birthing class. We only bought one pack. For the price, we wanted to see if we liked them before making a large investment. Our son was premature, so our newborn Kushies were too large for him until he reached about 6 and 1/2 pounds, despite the fact that they were sized 4 to 10 pounds. I found that though well made and wash friendly, they are very leaky. I much prefer the used velcro wraps and cloth diapers we got from a friend. They NEVER leak. At night, because we don't change our son as frequently, to keep away diaper rash we use disposables, which are also leaky. The covers we got from a friend, can be used around the disposables, which keeps our son's clothing and sheets dry all night. I have since found another cloth diapering system that is virtually leak proof. I recommend buying several types before investing heavily into one CD system."
4,simple and easy to use,"I got these for my daughter. I like this product alot because I don't have to use diaper cover and velcro closures eliminate danger of pins and fits perfectly. For overnight usage, I would recommend using extra liners to prevent leakage."
2,"Inexpensive, easy, and LEAKY","We bought some of these in the newborn and infant sizes before our first daughter was born. We quickly found that the newborn ones are useless, as no matter what combination of liner and diaper you use, the poop will get out of the diaper. Later, the infant ones became part of our cloth diaper rotation only as back-ups and only for use at home. The reason is that the legs lack proper gussets, so urine leeches directly from the lining of the diaper onto whatever clothing the little one is wearing. If your baby is still in the liquid poop stage, the legs completely fail to keep it in. The most absorbent, leak-proof, inexpensive, and eco-friendly option we've found is a combination of bamboo terry squares (fastened with Snappies), Kushies cotton liners, and Little Beetle one-size wool covers. If you want an all-in-one that won't turn you off cloth diapers forever, spend more money to get something good. (I've heard great things about Bum Genius, for example.)"
2,Not pleased with this cloth diaper,"I bought this diaper on a reference from a friend, I thought ""what a deal"" but it really is ""to good to be true"". I was not pleased at first with how tight I had to make it on my daughter just to make it snug around her leg, we often have leaks in that area. After she grew a little more they became better. After only having and using them for four months they are begining to have holes in them near the legs and waist. the velcro is curling and I must change her with in 3 hours other wise her clothes get wet at the waist. I have taken care of them as the maker suggests. I find it upsetting and disappointing that choosing to make a change from disposable to cloth for many reasons including cost and this is not a cost effective diaper, I don't see it lasting one child or even many more months. I am just very unhappy with this purchase. I only use them at home so if I need I have whatever I need here at my finger tips, extra clothes, etc."
2,"Leaky or bulky, is that really a choice I have to make?","I was really hoping these would work as they are pretty cheap as far as cloth goes. Unfortunately they leak like crazy, little bits seeped out on a lot of my daughter's jammies right off the bat and major leaks as soon as she started having good size bm's, within two weeks or so it was really bad.So I decided to just use an additional cover and they are HUGE on a little newborn body, and my baby is not that small. I did try the technique that one reviewer specified on how to fit the diaper, which helped but did not stop the leaks. I had an 8 1/2 pound baby and with this diaper and the cover she actually won't fit in most newborn size pajamas! Very disappointed."
2,not for babies with runny stools,"The Kushies All-in-ones don't contain runny stools well, nor are they very absorbant. A DSQ pre-fold held with pins or a snappi works better. The Kushies Classic diaper is less likely to leak and more absorbant fitted diaper."
2,"Ok for the novice cloth diaperer, easy learning curve","I started out diapering my son with Kushies Ultra AIOs when he was about three weeks old. I didn't like them because:1. They took EONS to dry.2. They leaked out of the legs. My son has fat little thighs and they still gaped.3. My son got horrible diaper rash from the cold, clammy wet cotton being up against his bum.The only thing I like about Kushies is that they are easily accessible to people who might be interested in cloth diapering but really have no idea where to start.Long story short, I ebayed them and bought Fuzzi Bunz. We are both so much happier! Fuzzi Bunz are more adjustable, not much more expensive, and dry in just a few hours of hanging indoors. And the pesky diaper rash went away with the Kushies!"
2,Don't like them much,"Before my baby was born I thought I'd love these, but it turns out that I really, really don't. First of all they are extremely bulky which isn't very conducive to a baby learning to crawl and develop their muscles well because it forces their legs so far apart.My baby pees a lot and I just don't see it worth putting these great big things into the wash after she just peed. I go through 17 diapers a day (because I change her immediately). At this price this is WAY too expensive. I've found using liners and just five covers works great for me. And seventeen of these wouldn't even fit in my washer every day.If your baby is a frequent pee-er you might want to consider using something else."
2,Get the Bum Genius 4.0 instead...,"Read the reviews and thought this would be a good value since the Bum Genius 4.0 2pack is 35.99 for 2. For that, it deserves 2 stars. However, in this case, we got what we paid for. The velcro straps are too firm and scratchy, and rides up on the baby if she's sitting up straight. The diaper is also very clunky, even for a re-usable. The outside material feels like a cheap swim suit and is not as soft as it should be for a baby's skin. The insert also leaked on the first use. I have had 2 pairs of the bum genius diapers and they have not leaked since our baby was a newborn, and still do not leak to this day. The inserts are much more absorbent and the material overall is much softer. The packaging says it's for 10-25lbs but I honestly don't think this product would be appropriate for any baby under 15 lbs. It's bigger, yet less absorbent than the Bum Genius. I would not recommend this product to other parents."
1,they fell apart during the first washing!,"I was set on using cloth diapers for our first baby, and was pleased to find that the highly rated Kooshies were available at Babies 'R Us. I bought two packages of the infant sized all-in-ones, and each one unravelled or frayed during the first washing! Fortunately, I did not have a problem returning them for store credit. I purchased Bumkins all-in-ones at another online store, and have been thoroughly satisfied with them. I recommend to those who choose cloth diapers, to pay the extra $ and get Bumkins which will last. I also have found the Bumkins to be extremely absorbent and have yet to experience leaks during the 8 weeks I've been using them."
1,Diapers,"I don't like anything about these diapers. My baby always had a rash due to the urine touching the skin. They don't wick the moisture away from the babies skin. The diaper is so bulking, my baby couldn't wear pants. Touching the inside of the soiled diaper could not be avoided. The bowel movements don't stay in the diaper. I had to throw them away."
3,"Cute diapers, but bulky","We have been using these diapers for about a week and so far we haven't had any leaks. I like that they are very easy to use and wash. The following are what I do not like:1) Bulkiness - I can't get my son's clothes on over the diaper2) The material of the outer part of the diaper - it rubs my son's skin and leaves red marks if he is sitting and his belly rolls over the top of the diaper3) It's difficult to get a good fit around my son's waist4) I'm not sure how long the velcro will last - from other reviews I have seen, many people prefer the snap closures because the velcro doesn't last long"
1,very pretty but do not do the job,We got these and almost did not use after a few leeks with them. They do not absorb and do not stay around the baby legs at all.Otherwise are very pretty looking.
3,Depends on the age group,"I used them on my 2 year old at night for a week, they fit, and he is now completely potty trained.I picked this brand because of the claim that they grow with the child. I can barely get them on my small-waisted 38 pound 4 year old, and they leak if he doesn't stay dry.I highly recommend fastening them and turning them inside out to wash. Great idea to whoever posted that!"
3,Very BIG,"I bought the 10-22 pound size for my 20 pound tall thinnish one year old and they are HUGE on her, like ridiculously big. My almost-walker cannot even sit up in these because they're enormous. I'll repost when she gains about 15 pounds and we try them again."
3,"Good for Toddlers at bedtime, but probably not infants.",I bought these for my 4 year old who occassionally wets the bed at night. They are great for this light-duty purpose. My dauther loves the fun designs and they are easy for her to put on/off like panties or she can pretend to be a baby and mom can put it on like a diaper.I used cloth diapers from the time she was born. I wouldn't recommend these for infants or toddlers who are not yet potty trained. They are not very absorbant (but work well enough to contain any night-time messes)and they are very bulky to wash and take a long time to dry. For those just starting out with cloth diapers I would recommend gDiapers.
5,Millie,"I did enjoy reading Millie, it told the story of the Holliway Oklahoma family before they moved to Boggy Creek, which was rhe first book I read in 6th grade and also have now."
3,"not a set, must order two.","This is not a set, like you would expect, you must order two to do both calipers.Rubber seemed a bit thinner than OE. Seems kind of high priced for what you get."
3,Disappointing but Fun,"Okay, I love to play computer soccer games and couldn't wait to get this game. It was a little disappointing because I wanted to do a season with an MLS team but I found out you couldn't. The graphics are pretty good and the controls are easy if you use a gamepad but it's strange that the only personal stats the game keeps track of are the goals and cards a person gets. Where are the assist? Saves? Are goals the only important stat in soccer? I don't think so. But overall the game was fun and I really can't stop playing it."
4,"A Good, Unique Biological Perspective on History","This would be an excellent book for the hardcore historian or the equally enthusiastic biologist, because it builds a neat and entertaining bridge between the two. Historically, Crosby does an excellent job in expounding upon the consequences of Europeon contact with the New World and accomplishes something quite unique. Most authors bog down in the details, but Crosby brings out the big picture, and neatly places the cause and effects of biological exchange between the once separated ""worlds."" This book changed the way I look at discovery and its consequences. This study examines the far reaching effects from syphillis to potatoes and makes for an eye-opening and distinctly different read.The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is I wanted more!"
5,Historical Writing at its finest,"Mr. Crosby's book is the finest examination of the inter-relations of history and biology that exist today. While it is a work of serious historical research, it is also a great read and Mr. Crosby has been able to blend a lot of facts with an entertaining story. It should be read by anyone who is interested in American history."
4,Must Read for World History Students,"I am currently in an AP World History class and for an extra credit assignment over our quarter break we could read this book and write an essay on it.Having not studied much about the Columbian Exchange before, reading this book was definitely an educational experience for me. I have also heard that on the AP test it is extremely helpful to have background knowledge on this topic.The only negative aspects of this book were that it could sometimes become repetitive, and since the book was published in the early 70's relations to this time period were at times incorrect.Overall I give this book 4/5 stars."
3,The mixing of cultures and biological interchange,"Good informative book. It contains many facts about the exchange of cultures and bio-life. Consequences, for-against, and a review of what colombus started: the mixing of 2 new worlds."
3,required reading,My daughter needed this book for class reading. The book was in pretty good shape but had a lot of writing and highlighting throughout.
3,Good But Not Her Best!,"I have always been a big Nancy Sinatra fan and was very anxious to hear this album when it came out a few years ago. Needless to say, I was pleased and not pleased. ""Crocodile Tears"",""Right Track, Wrong Train"", ""Are You On the Road To Loving Me Again"" are a few that really ARE vintage Nancy, but some of the others, ""For Me It's You"", ""One More For the Road"" just don't cut it. ""The Devil In Disguise"" is just AWFUL. She is off key and frankly is too old to be singing these types of songs. (Kind of like ""California Man"" off her her California Girl album.) Again, I am a huge Nancy fan, but this album left me cold."
4,Great for halloween or for dress up.,"I got the dress for my almost 2 year old to wear as a Halloween costume. It is very well made and she continues to wear it when she plays dress up. My only concern is the size. I bought a toddler size thinking tht it will be good for a 21 month old who is tall, but had to hemm it as it was too long. Other than the size issue, we are very happy with it and would definitely recommend it."
2,move along people,Night Stalker is the only good song on here.The rest arent even worth writing about.So dont waste your money.
1,Pretentious trash,"I find this book rates right up there with some of Norman Mailer's more incomprehensible books...boring and tiresome. It does, however, might good bedside reading. A page or two and you'll be sound asleep."
5,That Beautiful Book,"Ann Cowart Lutzky's evocative ""Those Beautiful Eyes"" transports the reader on a magic carpet ride from ancient Mesopotamia to the turbulent and transformational days of San Francisco in the 1960's. A student of ancient cultures, Lutzky demonstrates skillful and bold storytelling drawing upon primordial themes and archetypes. One of the primary threads reveals how the profound power of women - something understood by the ancients - has been corrupted and confused in the wake of our modern times. Her characters carry echoes of the ancients within their psyches and, possibly their very DNA. Those Beautiful Eyes is a kind of coming of age story for the ages, bringing the reader to a deep understanding about history, human nature and our evolutionary experience."
4,it's like a car accident,"I must say this is a pretty cool book although not for the squeamish. Graphic full color photographs that read like crime scene photographs or stills from a horror movie.There's the sexy display between two praying mantis before the male becomes a post-coitus snack. Another praying mantis dances merrily on the head of a fat shiny toad before meeting its inevitable end. Caterpillars greedily gorge themselves on tomatoes only to be sucked dry by more ever present praying mantis.The most graphic scenes though are the ones with the pinkies. Pinkies being born amongst a white blood smeared backdrop only to be gobbled up by another fat toad.It's sick to look at and even a bit morbid at times, but it's Mother Nature and a testament to the circle of life and the survival of the fittest."
4,camera purchase,Good cameras but did not expect them to be made in china as the camera label states.Thought they were made in usa.
3,"Camera does what it claims, but is not white in color","This camera is what it claims to be, however, the image is not accurate. You will receive a black camera, not a white one. Further, please note that the lux rating of this camera means that it REQUIRES a great deal of light to see anything at all. You cannot use this camera in low-light conditions, even ones often found in your typical home. If you want to use this camera in any condition except full sunlight, you will need an external light source. Good news, however, is that this camera IS sensitive to infrared and therefore an external infrared light source, (visible 800nm or non-visible 900nm), will suffice to add extra lighting needed. For the price, this camera is great. If you are looking for something that can handle lighting conditions other than bright daylight, direct sun, you will need to look elsewhere."
3,good little camera,"This is a little good camera, decent wide angle view, with good color, for the price, dont expect to get anything at night without additional lighting, I would have liked if the power/video cord could have ran through the housing bracket insted of the outside."
3,Limited range but otherwise good,"From a few close encounters I have had, I would guess this thing has a range of about 500ft (when cops were pointing the radar straight at me), which is near the same range of radar's, so don't put too much faith in it. The one concern I do have with this, there were two times I forgot to unplug it from the car it drained out my battery. Now maybe that's just my car, but maybe it's the detector... Beware and be aware."
4,Good unit most of the time,"I've had this unit for just over two years now and although I only use it on the highway, I have to say it works pretty well. Detects Ka band well in advance, even on small hills and around curves. Only problem I've had with the unit is the speaker broke. Since it's out of warranty Beltronics wants $80 to fix it. A bit much for such a minor repair."
4,fresh,"lemar breathes new life into the uk rnb scene , his voice is a cross between luther vandross and jaheim.His debut album dedicated has a nice mix of styles from old school soul to mainstream rnb pop.he does a great cover version of al greens lets stay together other highlights is the beautiful acoustic track ""all i ever"" do the funky sounding ""fresh"" of as lice of vintage Rnb with ""sweet love"" There are many other memorable moments on dedicated however there are a few misteps such as the uninspiring ""lullaby"" on the whole a very promising debut im sure as the years role by his song writing will grow to match his unmatchable vocal talents"
3,Okay,This is a great toy to look at. My 9 years old son played with it and the front immediately broke off. It is not durable. I don't recommend this car as a toy.
5,One of the greats,"I got such a good deal on this, I bought two. It is a tribute to one of the greatest and most recognizable TV show cars in the world. One will stay in storage. The other will go on display. Its no fun if you can't actually play with it. Buy two and use your imagination for the sounds and stunts like we did back in the days when I was a kid!"
2,Decent replica for the price,"I'd been waiting for the release of the 1966 TV Batmobile for quite a while. This was the basic version of the car - I believe there is an elite and prestige version. The proportions and detail on the car is quite good. Only criticism I have is the amount of flaws in the finish. A good polishing, buffing and wax improved the model's appearance. Considering quality diecast cars in this scale can easily be $100 or more, the $50 I paid for this probably limited run model is very reasonable."
2,If Batman & Robin figures are missing... IT'S WORTHLESS!!!!!,"It's a complete nonsense paying more than 50 Bucks, for a die-cast Batmobile model car missing Batman & Robin figures.Back in the 1960s, AURORA toys issued a plastic Batmobile assembling set, with all parts and decals included in the box (Batman & Robin figures were also included).Almost simultaneously, British company CORGI TOYS released a smaller die-cast toy Batmobile that included both figures, with some mechanical working parts (the turbine flame moved when the car was rolling, the chromed mortar tubes launched bright red plastic bombs, and it had even a spring-activated brass chain-breaker blade in the front).The success of such models was instantaneous!!!Today, the same CORGI toy car is worth some hundred Dollars, if you still can find it.Check it out at eBay..."
4,Thee One And Only Batmobile,"A great model. The big size is fun to look at. I collect this size model car, and this one floors them every time, have some fun and buy one The price is good too I saw one at toys r us for more money! That makes a person feel good these days"
3,Not quite good enough.,"If you are looking for information on how do playful spanking, domination, etc., this is not a very good source. It does not give enough information for someone just trying it for the first time. You could probably do much better on your own without this video.If you like the spanking/whipping/domination genre, this will not be very entertaining. It is too mild with no real plot.If you like the typical Nina Hartley's sex video's, you should like this one. It is about the same as the others. I would only recommend it if you are interested in her regular sex videos, not if you are looking into mild s/m."
1,Great if you are looking for Porn,Not helpful at all if you are looking for help with your BDSM relationship.
5,Just a good now as then,"I remember vividly watching Gary Cooper explain the ""Real West"" in Black and White as a very young boy. I like to think his story telling style is one of the reasons I became a history teacher. When I saw this great tale was available on CD-rom, I had to have it and did it bring back memories. I am so glad I bought this program."
3,Beware the historical omissions,"This is visually an interesting video on the West, but I feel sad that it reflects more of the prejudice of the time period it was made in. The photos are all of white people in the west. It's missing the pictures of the Chinese in California, the black and Hispanic cowboys, and the Hispanics in California in the late 1800's. Gary Cooper does a nice job narrating and there is humor in describing the Old West."
5,NHL 2000,"This game I thing, has the best graphics out of any game. It's so cool you even get to pick what jersey you want your team wearing."
3,Nice but a few problems,"Overall I like this drill but there are 2 problems that would make me consider buying another DeWalt drill. First after about 3 years of very minimal use both batteries have died, and of course the price of one battery is close to half the price of the entire drill purchased new. The second problem is the terrible balance of the drill, It can stand up on its own, but add quick change chuck and it cant even stand on its own. So...........In hindsight I wish I had bought th Makita.Peter G"
3,Loyd Newman,"I bought this drill to replace an older 12 volt DeWalt 945 drill. The older one still works, but batteries are very hard to find. This one's batteries are a joke. There is no trigger guard. This makes putting it in a nail belt interesting. To do any screw driving both batteries are needed to last almost as long as the one in the older DeWalt.This is a very bad replacement for the 945. You will have to go to 18 or 24 volt to get the same performance.In my opinion this is a toy designed for tightening screws around the house."
3,"Great Drill, Bad Battery Performance","I love the balance, torque (and adjustability), low and high speed settings...but the battery life (both the length they hold a charge and the number of charges they take before end of life) pales in comparison to my old (non XR) DeWalt 12 V cordless."
4,It's nice to go back...,"It's funny what ten years of technology can do to an idea. I know people are tired of new versions of Myst (Masterpiece Edition, Special Edition, DVD, sequels, etc.) but this one really the best. If your computer can push the pixels the game really moves ahead of the pack. It looks great, even compared with the more recent rerendered versions. It gives you a genuine sense of place that was missing from previous attempts, and it runs on my old G3 Mac."
2,Not For Me!,"I'm not the sort who likes FPS or violent, gore filed games. I'm attracted to games that make you think. RealMyst ran very well on my 1.25 ghz G4 PowerMac on 10.2.6, the graphics were great. But I found the story to be very dark and creepy. Most of the time I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do next. Within a few days it was off my hard drive.I really wanted to like RealMyst, but it just wasn't for me. YMMV."
5,A Soulful Journey,"This book is a soulful journey into the heart and mind of a man committed to his craft. It is the most well-researched book on the topic I've ever read.It is an education in the science of vegitarianism, as well as a good read for those who are vegan-wannabees. The recipies are wonderful.I wish I could send a copy to every member of Congress. Reading it would convince them to repeal the anti-cannabis laws of the '50s.I anxiously await a sequel."
4,Herbal Inspiration,"I am highly pleased with this Corelle product. When I first saw this pattern a few years ago, I was inspired to embrace the ""herbal"" design and ""look"" for my dream kitchen. The soft sage green, ivory/cream along with the lavender and yellow add ""punch"" to the color scheme. Corelle lives up to its durability and I highly recommend its products for either that everyday or special occasion use."
4,Good Book on the Korean War,The author hits home with a war that most have forgotten but we must never. It is also an excellent book on the growing up from a small town to the war to the politics of Washington. It is a nice showing of a man beating the politics to save himself.
5,Very helpful to the new parent,"As new parents, our first child had colic, which is very tough. This book helped us tremendously. First, it helped us to understand what was going on with our child and not to feel like failures because we could not solve it. Second, the book gave us very practical and very loving guidelines as to how to each our little girl to sleep. Of course we adapted what we read, but the book gave us a very important structure on a topic that is very tough for the new parent."
5,"How your baby can come to ""sleep like a baby""","This book is wonderful. Our son had trouble taking naps and going to sleep at night until we tried Weissbluth's methods. Readers should note that all negative reviews of this book are based on discredited ideology (e.g., the slanderous suggestion that Dr. Weissbluth must hate children because he counsels firmness) rather than on experience (i.e., the critics don't seem to have actually tried Dr. Weissbluth's methods). Positive reviews are by readers who tried the methods (and had tried others as well) and found them to work. Set aside your ideology and try it, for your child's, and your family's, sake."
4,My husband even read this book!,"Continuous lack of sleep for parents and your baby is terrible! This book explains how important both daytime and nighttime sleep is for a baby. You may not be comfortable letting your baby cry, which this book does recommend. My husband and I were not advocates of crying it out, but based on the book we came up with a variation that worked for us. (Crying it out only for daytime naps (when we KNEW the baby needed to nap)). Getting the daytime sleep in order helped the nighttime sleep get much better! The book points out that parents don't let protest cries sway them when the child wants something that is unsafe, so protest cries for avoiding naps can be heard guilt-free. All chapters have experiences of parents that share the same concerns and love for their children as we did. While we didn't take the every piece of advice verbatum, this book really helped us"
4,"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child-Really Happy Parents!","After 8 weeks of getting up twice a night and seldom napping, our son was sleeping through the night and taking regular naps within a week. Dr. Weissbluth's research and suggestions are 100% on target. Our son is now 18 months old and tells us with a simple ""Night-Night"" when he wants to take a nap or go to bed. He loves being in his crib and enjoys going to sleep. Those that criticize the book either didn't read it thoroughly or gave up before the end of the magical ""3 days"". Letting our son learn to put himself to sleep was not easy, (does ANYONE like to hear a baby crying?) but it is probably one of the wisest things we have done. And it certainly is easier than many of the things we will have to teach him over the next several years. While Dr. Weissbluth's advice was tremendously helpful, it is sometimes difficult to discern exactly what recommendation he makes for which age group."
2,"Great for some people maybe, but not all parents!","The scientific studies are interesting, but any book which doesn't consider the individual child should be read with caution. Dr. Weissbluth seems to think that there is one way to work with a child around sleeping habits. At first, I actually tried his recommendations and only ended up crying and frustrated. I actually almost burned the book, but am against book burning. I was much more relaxed when I realized that books can never tell you how to work with a child. You must use parental instinct. My daughter still does not sleep through the night at 6 months old, and yes, I'm exhausted, but I am going to keep trying to figure out her own needs and patterns and not be binded by one book's strict recommendations."
4,It Worked for Me,"I discovered this book when my daughter was 3 months old, and started using the techniques described. My daughter is now nearly 3 years old, and she has superb sleeping and self-soothing habits. I would recommend this book to all new parents."
3,"not as helpful as Babywise, or Ferber's sleep book","I found the book helpful in some areas such as learning to recognize signs of fatigue. However, the program got my sons off of their schedule. As time progressed, they slept worse and worse during the day. Once I had them back on a schedule, using Babywise and Ferber's method, my sons started sleeping very well. Again, the book is a good resource for some problems, but using a schedule was much more helpful for me."
1,Advocates Cruelty and Abuse,"Here is yet another example of a parenting text incorrectly assuming that what is best for the parents is best for the child. The author attempts to frighten parents into letting their babies ""cry it out"" claiming that their brains require a certain type and amount of sleep. These assumptions are not based on any valid research. Ignored by the author is the question of your child's psyche that will be damaged because he feels rejected by the people he is genetically programmed to trust. Every parent must be free to make his/her own choices about how their baby should sleep and not be dictated to by self-proclaimed experts. Read this book if you are curious, but read something else too that offers another approach and let your instincts decide"
4,Educational,"I'm learning as much as I can about my father's World War II outfit the 445th BG. The book taught much about the aircraft, the men, and the thought process during the war."
5,A charming heroine,"Maggie Listen is one of the most delightful heroines you'll ever meet. She's completely natural and loves to dance.Everett Dulanis is wrong for her. He's in love with another woman, cannot appreciate Maggie--and, worst, has no desire to dance.But Carolyn Brown brings them together in this wonderfully written and thoroughly enjoyable novel. Both Maggie and Everett change and grow and finally fall in love. Will they find out before it's too late? Well, this is a romance so of course they do, but not before a lot of fun takes place."
3,"Delta Force, lacking some important stuff.","Delta Force is overall an acceptable game to my standards, but it has some low points to it.PROS: -There are about 40 missions in Delta Force that take place all over the world- Huge environments to move your soldier around in.-Fun missions that include hostage rescue, raiding terrorist bases, finding a bomb, ambushing a convoy of vehicles and many others.CONS: -Only about 5 or 6 total weapons which [stinks]badly.-Cheesy and cartoony moans that enemies make when they are shot.-The guns dont move around when u walk, no idle animations-When u scope with a rifle, it doesnt go full screen, just a circle that pops up with crosshairs.-Graphics engine is showing age bigtime.OVERALL: DF is pretty good, but needs some work. Buy it, play it, forget about it. 3 stars total -Patrick (Remeber its just an opinion so dont get mad if u disagree.)"
3,ABOUT A THIRD IS WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING.......,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A DIFFERENT TYPE MUSIC THAN I GOT. I DON'T CARE FOR PIANO AND GUITAR SOLOS VERY MUCH. BUT THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE THIS FORM OF MUSIC WILL LIKE THIS CD.
2,Alfandega,"Music does not come up to the premium price of this CD. ""Celie's Blues"" is better than the rest."
3,Adjust,Should have had Denise Reis in person performing on the video and not the awful background colours.Spoilt the video
1,Corny Corny Corny,"This movie was SO not worth my time.. I love David Spade on Just Shoot Me, so of course i rented it.. but the story is dumb, unbelievable and not original... I suggest you spend your time on a better Spade movie, Tommy Boy or something that is actually funny!!!! so... my advice to you... DON'T RENT IT!!!!!"
2,"Semi--Funny, unrealistic, and stupidly predictible.","David Spade was funny in Tommy Boy and even funnier in Black Sheep, but without Chris Farley at his site he fails in this. The movie is about a loser who falls inlove with his new neighbor and kidnaps her dog to get her attention. The sick and unrealistic thing is that they actually get closer from this, you can see jokes coming from a mile away in this lame unrealastic plotHow can any say this is a romantic comedy? Whats romantic about stealing a womens puppy? And another thing, why don't the two actors playing the french people speak french in the scenes where they are alone? I never saw the end of this but I already knew what was gonna hap... he gets the girl. David Spade and Artie Lange have some real funny parts, but they can't save this miserably script (which Spade co-wrote) This just missed getting pne star because its so terrible its almost funny, but almost is the key word."
5,Lost& Found is a hit!,"I have a very pickey taste about movies in general, but when i decided to take a chance with Lost & Found, i was stunned. Not only did i laugh so hard i cried, but i could sit and watch the lovely and talented Sohpie Marceau grace my television for hours. David Spade was hilarious as usualle and Sophie Marceau gave it splash of life and fun. All in all i think Lost & Found was a great movie and that you should really give it a chance because David Spade puts on a great show and as i have said twice now, Sophie Marceau is a complete knock out. It's movie bliss!"
1,Never has a celebrity begged more to be slapped,"David Spade is the single-most irritating celebrity ever to emerge from the Hollywood toilet. How can a man with so little to offer be so damned pleased with himself? This movie is definitive proof of his infinite insufferability. The fact that he worked with the immensely talented (if materially-challenged) Chris Farley is the only reason I even saw his other films. Do yourself a favor and avoid this guy like the plague. He won't mind, he's too arrogant to notice."
3,Better than expected,"I never really cared for David Spade, but had to see this movie because I'm a Sophie Marceau fan. Turned out that Spade was very funny, his character very likable, the story a little stale but enough laughs to make up for it. Very cute movie."
4,Lost & Found,"Great film. If you liked Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, or any of the other mindless comedies this one is for you. Plot, cast, story, all about the same. The star always comes out on top in the end. Just good hearted fun, gotta love it! PLUR - iKON"
5,great,"One Word people: Great. This movie is a collection of some of the best acting, dialogue, and one-liners ever. It is unoriginal, but i place this movie OVER There's Something About Mary. We continue going to see @Quentin Tarantino films, thought they aren't original. Come on people, this is one of the funniest movies of all time, it is on my top 10 list. Email me for the other 9. Thanks, Jonathan"
2,THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT SPADE!,"OK, I happen to like David Spade and this film is dangerously close to stealing the plot of 'There's Something About Mary' with nowhere near the wit or charm, but I have to say I was able to watch this so-so romantic comedy and laugh a few times. This is not an original film by any stretch, but fans of Spade or the beautiful Sophie Marceau should enjoy this lighthearted romp. Most of the jokes fall flat, but there is enough going for this one to give it a look when there's nothing else on the tube!"
1,This was the worst movie I've ever seen.,"In case nobody noticed, David Spade has never been funny. He was only tolerable in other movies because of Chris Farley. This movie was the absolute worst peice of garbage I've ever seen in my life."
2,Not a great instructional DVD,"I was hoping for a DVD that broke-down Rockabilly guitar styles but what I got was a two DVD set watching Jim Weider play guitar and wondering, how the heck did he do that?1) This DVD is NOT for beginners. If you are not an accomplished finger-picker, don't bother with this DVD, you aren't ready for it yet..which I am not.2) The only really instructional parts of this DVD set are the two booklets that come with each of the DVDs showing the TAB for the various licks.On a positive note, Jim is a fine player and it if this DVD was $10, I wouldn't mind watching him play so much."
5,Buy This Now,"If you want to learn about rockabilly, buy this DVD set above all others. Wieder takes you through the rockabilly greats in detail - explaining not only the licks and rhythm figures, but also the gear these guys used. You get great material on Scotty Moore, Eddie Cochran, Paul Burleson, etc. Very different styles, but all covered very well.I have wasted a lot of money on so-so rockabilly DVDs, but this set I will keep forever."
5,Great video to watch alone,"What I liked about the video is the original equipment used. Jim Weider is not only a great guitar player but very knowledgeable about the equipment, sound techniques Scotty Moore, Duane Eddy, Chuck Berry and Eddie Cochran used. He assumes an intermediate level of playing. He breaks down the licks well. On the ""bad"" side, there are no accompaniment tracks to practice on. His teaching is not very systematic and moves all over the place quite a bit. However watching him play all the classic guitars and amps with the band is worth the price alone. I wish he would also include Cliff Gallup (Gene Vincent's guitarist). Highly recommend this to all the rockabilly fans."
1,"Awful, terrible- BEWARE",I have two SHORT HAIR Chihuahuas and it broke before I was even done with the first one.
1,what a bummer,I should have spent the money to buy a clipper set that would actually cut hair. The only thing that works from this set is the handheld scissors. Wish I could get my money back.
1,Great clippers fo a chihuahua,These clippers are fine if you have a small dog with fine hair. They were useless on my Australian shepherd. I returned them and took her to the groomers.
2,Andis Clippers,The clippers are very quiet and seem to cut well. The only trouble I have is the lever on the side catches on the seam of the clippers. It is difficult to move the lever forward to move the cutting blade forward.
2,Doesn't cut my Shih-Tzu's hair,"This product is working as a soothing massager right now....my Shih-Tzu likes it when I try to cut his hair but it doesn't cut off his hair as quickly or as much. My dog's hair (1"" long) jams up the teeth/edges every 2-3 strokes. I've tried on 2 separate occasions, and he looks the same. I was only able to shed maybe 10% of his hair...not recommended for a Shih-Tzu. jennifer"
3,Good but not enough as I though,"I purchased one of this on a store, got good deal but when I use it with my Poodles, the machine heats so much after 10 minutes that you can't keep it in your hand, you end up grooming your dog like in 2 or 3 days. I use it now only to cut feet hair and tail, maybe a little on the face. So think twice before getting yours."
1,bad choice,"Item looked good and packaged well, but has inferior power and cutting blades. Unit cut about 14 inches and became so dull that it would not cut any more and started pulling my dog's clean and brushed coat. Left me in quite a perdiciment."
3,Good to know,"This item includes all the pieces you should need to do a nice job. I think it fails making the high mark because it offers a dvd with it but the dvd doesn't work. That leaves no written instructions or working dvd to guide you through the use of the product, making the use a bit scary considering it will be used on a dearly loved pet that doesn't need to be scared by your lack of education."
2,Dissapointed,I have a cocker spaniel so his ears have tons of fur on it. The clippers could not handle that much hair so I had to make numerous passes to ensure that the hair was all cut the same length. I also had to take off the attachment comb every 5 minutes to get the hair out of the blade. The hair gets stuck on the bottom crevice of the blade causing the blade to stop moving.The clippers worked fine on the rest of his body since the fur isn't as thick. Also another issue with the clippers is heat. After using the clippers for about 45minutes--the blade gets really hot.These clippers aren't for dogs with thick fur.
5,EXcelent Clippers,"Clippers are the best I ever had. They are very quiet, so they don,t scar our dog. They cut through our Goldens hair with ease. I would highly recommend these."
1,Won't cut my shih tzu's hair,"I didn't know better so I bought the cheapest kit I could find figuring what difference did it make because I wasn't a professional. Well these clippers don't cut my shih tzus hair. I have to press really hard to get it to cut, the plastic combs are useless as well. She ended up looking awful because I had to press so hard to get a little bit off. I ended up having to spend $109 to buy the Andis Professional Animal Clipper. That's much better and I'm able to cut my dog's hair without a problem. It cost almost $100 to get a dog groomed in NYC, plus all the time it takes to pick up and drop them off as well. It makes much more sense to just give your dog a haircut after you bathe it."
2,NOT for chows,i bought this to try and trim my red chow. not a chance. it might work on small dogs with fine hair but this was like trying to empty the ocean with a teacup. with a hole in the cup. it just couldn't do the job.olan
2,Weak motor,"Not worth the money for a thick haired animal, Need more Power. Takes me 2 hours with numerous breaks to let the motor cool & multiple passes to get it somewhat good."
1,Not worth the money,"I have a Cairn Terrier, the first time I used the clippers they worked ok (just okay), it took me hours to trim him.The next time they didn't do anything, so I had him groomed professionally. 3 months after a pro. grooming he was just a getting a little bit fluffy, I figured the trimmers might work better now that his fur isn't full grown, again they did nothing! I got as much fur off him as I would brushing him. These clippers are useless, I don't know if they are only made for poodle fur or if the blade is only good for one use. I wish I could get my money back, what a waste, they weren't super expensive but they were definitely not cheap either."
2,not that great,"blades went dull fast, and even when they weren't dull wouldn't cut through my yorkie's hair"
1,Cheap Junk,"I have a Bichon with *short* hair that I keep that way, and I do not use a clipper on his head. The combs melted, and without them, the blades dulled, and they go out of line really easily. They are frustrating to put back on after cleaning, too.Spend a few more bucks and get a better brand. Just because there's a paw print on it doesn't mean they're meant to clip a dog."
3,Pet Clipper didn't clip,"In all fairness to the product - this might be because our Australian Shepherds have such thick, yet very fine hair. We watched the video and tried to do it just like they did - but with poor results. Maybe this is why those grooming salons charge so much. That - and being in danger of being bitten all the time!"
2,Horrible product,"DO NOT (seriously) buy this product for trimming cats. It is just as bad as the $10 Oster hair trimmer i once bought at a thrift store. On my cat, it just combed her hair with only cutting little tiny bit, hardly anything. It would probably take about 2-1/2 hours to finish a small cat w/ this machine, like w/ the $10 Oster. Buy another one that mentions cats in the review."
3,Beware! Contents are USA-focused.,"Mainly a telephone directory of over 2500 organizations (with brief descriptions) in USA. Non-USA buyers, like me, should have known this before buying."
5,Beautiful#!,"Deborah Camps stories just keep getting better and better! There is so much white- Indian hate, but also suspense adventure and knowledge. But the beautiful love that is between Ted's and Storm-In-his-Eyes is so heart filling it just makes you want to cry. It makes you wish to find a deep and passionate love just like theirs!! The passion literally jumps right off the page. What hot sizzle!! Too much to delete, just noticed I wrote Ted (oh wow) meaning TESS This is without doubt a man-woman affair!! And oh thank goodness it is! This is a must read, you-all!"
3,Mixed,"I came across this book many many years after it was published, and was eager to read it since I knew the author personally. I just loved the first few chapters, I thought they were full of suspense and good tension and detail. After the heroine got in with the Blackfeet tribe though, her character seemed to change to someone who seemed to think she was entitled and she had an attitude with the people in the tribe, and she was just annoying. I wanted the hero to put her on a horse and send her on her way back home to her brother. So my review is mixed, it's part great and part disappointing."
5,Excelent Deal!,This was a good deal the item arrived on time and in the conditions described. Thank You!
3,Artistic fever,"Well this one is for ""artists"". At least that's what the writer says. I got bored of phrases like ""We artists this..."", and ""We artists that..."". Being a computer scientist interested in computer graphics I wonder where these guys would be without computers. The book includes indeed some good tips that can be applied with any graphics package or language but the content in general is very 3DS oriented. The reference on VRML is vague and generic. If you are looking for a scientific computer graphics reference look elsewhere.If you consider yourself a ""serious artist..."" then this may be for you."
3,"Good for another writer, not much for Stephenson","An odd book. The technological premise isn't really pursued or fully explored, and in fact its working is left somewhat obscure. There are bits of plot hinted at but never developed. Maybe over-zealous editing. There are occasional bursts of Stephenson's wit and flare mixed with rather flat, pondersome spells. It edges into Tom Clancy's turf a little. The ending is disappointing: it simply unravels and stops. Maybe four stars for a lesser author but three for Stephenson who, by now anyway, is a much finer, tighter author."
4,Good enough,"Interface is not what I expected of a Stephenson book. I equate him with darker hard-SF and expect him to expand my mind about future-tech like he did with Diamond Age and Crytonomicon. Instead, this book is less about technology and more about the characters and an interesting premise. Stephenson seems to be consistently good at character development in his books, and Interface is no exception. I really felt like I knew all of the characters by the end. A worthy read for Stephenson fans, but not one of my favorite."
3,lost me at the end,"When I first picked up this book I thought it was great! I love Selena, but when I got to the end and saw pictures of her in her coffin I was really put off. Maybe it is just a personal preference but I disagreed with the inclusion of such a private thing."
4,I LIKED IT!,I LIKED THE BOOK. I WAS ACCURATE AND WAS NOT DISRESPECTFUL OF SELENAS MEMORY! I STILL HD THE SCENSE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE MONEY OF OF SELENA.
4,A must to have to all Selena fans!,"This book is written so well.The book goes through Selena`s life and career.And it of course includes inside informations and pictures about Selena and her dear and loving husband Chris.I wish there`ll be more information and pictures about the life of the two lovebirds.Because despite the ugly and mean rumours about Selena and Chris ,i truly and deeply believe that they were very happy together and very much in love.They were planning their future very seriously,a new house and kids.She wanted to have 5 kids.There are also very sad pictures of her funeral and her coffin.The pictures make you feel very sad and frustrated.I mean the big question in my mind was and is, WHY? Why she has to die?What was the meaning of this?But i really think that this book is very useful and brilliant to all Selena fans out there. The pictures of the book are generally awesome and great!"
3,Did the authors get their degrees in public relations?,"Remembering Selena/Recordando a Selena is a must-have for Selena's fans. It is filled with page after page of glossy photos of the fallen star. However, the superficiality of the book destins it to become a dust-collector on coffee tables everywhere. I haven't opened my copy of the book in a few years. Simply stated, there's nothing in it to capture my interest -- no fascinating stories or new information regarding the singer. Selena's story ran deeper than this glossy P.R. tool would allow one to believe. Buy it for the pictures, but don't buy it if you want to know more about Selena. Selena - Como la Flor, by Joe Nick Patoski; and Selena's Secret, by Maria Celest Arraras, are more interesting reads if you want more than just a shallow look into the life of one of Tejano music's greatest performers."
3,"Powerful, but battery life seems short","Consumer Reports warns that this model's battery life is only fair, and I've found that to be true. It only sank about four dozen screws before a battery that had charged for five hours gave out. The screws were long, and they were drilled into dense wood, but I was still disappointed.Otherwise, it is a very impressive drill, with lots of torque."
1,Decent tool but you'll spend a fortune in batteries,"Dewalt Cordless tools are decent enough but they seem to be trying to make extra profits by selling more batteries. Battery life is so poor that in a few years you'll spend more than the tool cost on batteries. Everyone that I know that has purchased Dewalt is switching to Porter Cable, Rigid, Bosch and even Ryobi."
2,Battery is a big let down,"The drill is fine and does what I want, but I cannot finish a job before both batteries are drained. When fully charged they drill fine in to a solid tree stump. But after drilling three 1/2 inch wide 12 inch deep holes the battery gives out and has to be swapped.Now Dewault has come out with longer life batteries, I wonder why, but for those of us who already have the drill maybe they should offer an upgrade program to make buying the new batteries cheaper so we get the most out of an otherwise decent drill."
1,Buy a P*C or Bosch,"Piece of S**T! Dewalt used to make very reliable tools. That's why I bought this one, my old 12v finally died. From the very beginning I could tell qulity was no longer an issue. Out of the case the clutch didn't work (2 settings 1 and drill). The speed range slips anytime it runs for more then 5 screws, and on long jobs batteries only last about 15mins and require 45mins to charge.On top of all this DeWalts' customer service sucks!!!"
5,Addictive.................!,"Ashwave is creating a distinctive and emotionally resonant electro-organic fusion of music from the roots of Brian Eno with a flavor of Progressive Rock ala Pink Floyd from dark side of the moon days and Steve Wilson's No-man and have a real knack for gorgeous, catchy and dreamy melodies.This is a must have CD that you must grab right now before it becomes a rarity, highly recommended ."
1,Are they still selling this?,"I bought one of these for about twice the price years ago and it worked about 3-star range but then totally stopped working. I couldn't find anywhere online to seek redress at that time so I dumped it. Pay attention to the review that mentions problems -- maybe that was my situation, I don't know. I'm not taking another chance on this. It did help remove some stains, but no more than other products."
3,Refillable?,"I am wondering if the little tide containers are refillable? We do not use tide and don't want to start, but I would love a product like this.Portable would be awesome also. Why be tied down to a power cord? Rechargeable batteries are awesome!"
1,Amazing claim does not work!,I read the manufacturers claims and purchased this product on-line. I thought I could clean the white edges of my natural cotton bedspread that touch the carpet in my bedroom and turned a little dark over time. I followed the instructions precisely and this product DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to remove any of the stain/discoloration. I am very disappointed and feel totally ripped off.
1,The Prince and the Pauper,"I don't know how to review this as I have never received this item. The latest date it was to be received was January 6,2011 and here it is January 15th and I have still not received it. Have written several times and no answer. This does not speak well for Direct USA"
1,waste of time,"It's plot has almost nothing in common with Twain's masterpiece, which could be made into brilliant film without any alternations.I wonder if people who wrote those positive reviews ever read the book. This is not common book for children, but the one you can read and enjoy at any age(unlike Dumas and Jules Verne). It's language is rich and convincing.This movie looks like adaptation of another book with the same title and written by some 3-rd rate author. All that is good in the book is NOT here and apart from a few scenes (those rare ones that resemble Mark Twain)it is full of most predictable and shallow cliches. It was total waste of time (2 hours, mind you!) but at least it made me reread this great book."
4,"Oldie, but goodie","Ifyou love old movies, you're gonna love the orginal Prince and the Pauper film with Errol Flyn and the Mauch twins. I watched it as a kid and find, as an old man, I still enjoy it. The quality of the reproduction in DVD format is excellent. I recommend it highly."
4,Canon 40/41 ink,"1. Items arrived promptly and as advertised.2. No invoice with dollar amount of sale included [just product invoice] -- I had to go back to original email confirmation -- needed for tax records.3. California sales tax included [ink ordered June 30, 2011]. There was a notice about the ""possibility"" of a state tax with three or four states listed [not including California], but no indication at all that the vendor was located in Sacramento, CA. I found this out from the return address label."
2,arrived incomplete,i recieved the order in good time but only got the ink cartridges. i never got the photo paper that was also included in the ad. i will probably just buy it at staples next time.
5,Does what it's supposed to,"I got the canon ink twin pack and i think it is the best bang for your buck as HGTV would call it. I haven't had any problem with it, and the delivery was superb."
4,Great deal!,This is the cheapest way to buy this ink I could find. Cheaper than Walmart! With an added bonus of paper!
2,"Looks good, but","Haven't had a chance to install one of the ink cartridges, but the glossy paper is mediocre at best, lighter stock and extremely difficult to get proper color qirh my usual settings. Very disappointed as contrasted (no pun) with Epson premium glossy. As a result, if you need paper for throw away snapshots, this is your choice. Otherwise, you may want to reconsider. This is another lesson that one gets what one pays for . . ."
4,Canon PG-40 / CLI-41 Cartridges and Glossy Photo Paper Combo Pack,"Assuming your printer uses these cartridges these are a decent value compared to buying them seperately and you get bonus free glossy photo 4x6s. You cannot find a better deal or package on canon inks for this printer than this. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that canon ink is expensive and not a ""great"" value; but these cartridges have the print heads inside them and for that reason alone I feel that I had better buy the genuine product. Go for it!"
4,"canon pg-40,cli-41 & glos",price and prompt shipment very good. ink cartridges do not have a large amount of ink. this is the only negative.
3,Prefer a change in the product offered,"I don't need the photo pack along with the cartridges. I know I can get the cartridges individually, but couldn't there be some cost savings if both PG-40 and -41 are bought together without the photo pack?Thank you."
1,Not what I wanted,"Probably because my printer is an older one, it's harder and harder to get correct color cartridges for it. This time, I had to buy the cartridges and paper as a bundle, which I did not want. And then, the cartridges were not even the right kind, although the web site matched it with my printer."
3,Too Expensive.,"This is, of course, where the manufactures make the money. I wonder what it ""REALLY"" costs to manufacture this stuff. Hey, common, it's just ink."
5,Inks at a very great price,"These are regular retailer quality ink, at a cheaper price, buy!! I have saves quite some money buying this combo."
5,Hard To Find Cartridges,I have had a hard time finding the Canon PG-40 and CL-41 Ink Cartridges at my local WalMart. They are almost constantly sold out. This Canon Ink and Paper Combo Pack is a great deal. It is far cheaper than WalMart's regular price for individual cartridges. The direct mailing to my residence is also a plus because I don't have the inconvenience of leaving my home only to be disappointed with the out-of-stock item.
1,Wrong item,"Unfortunately, I used Amazon's ink selection tool to make sure this item would work with my printer. It didn't, so I wasted both time and money on this item."
3,"Canon PG-40, CLI-41","It has very good color, but, I would have given it 4 or 5 star if it wasn't SO expensive, and don't get very much output from them, especially the CLI-41"
4,Happy,I am very happy with this ink package! I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't checked out to many others!
5,I hate buying ink.,"Will there ever be enough value for your money when it comes to buying ink? Product was as described; new ink, best price I could find and it was delivered fast."
2,Panasonic 9.4GB DVR double sided Disc,"Unfortunately this is a purchase I made in error - I thought I was purchasing a smaller diameter disc for my camcorder. I called the supplier and informed them of the error I had made. The supplier requested I send the disc back for a refund, I sent back the disc and I am waiting for a reply."
3,Storage DVD Ram,"My husband wanted this DVD Ram to use as storage for children's pictures, and add to it later. Not sure that he can, because it needed to be finalized, then will only play on one VCR, not the others. So time will tell if he'll be able to add more pictures. Directions weren't very explicit, as I recall."
2,"Well done, but just too violent for me","This game has many positive aspects as detailed by other reviewers, but was just too violent for me. I found the images of severed heads and limbs disturbing. While the game does have some good strategy elements and character development, in the end it is a first person shooter and your main activity is killing. The plot was very good and kept my going long enough to finish the game. I guess I should stick with Lucas Arts titles."
5,Definately a classic,a classic game.a lot of fun.it is seriously frightening.its a role playing game.you build up your skills as the story progresses.
3,It's toooooooo hard....,"I can't get through it. The bad guys constantly respawn. There is an extrememly meager supply of weapons. When you happen to luck upon a weapon laying around, count on it being shoddy. The medical supply is almost as bad. Going back and forth between your inventory is cumbersome.I think the only way I could ever get through this game is to play it through by cheating in god mode several times and then trying to play it without cheats. The makers didn't allow for an effective god mode cheat though. It something to have to go into the game files and text edit, which didn't work for me at all.This has all the makings of a great game, but it's way too frustrating for me."
3,Finally a sequel for a great game,"SS2 finally gives us what we wanted most: more of the great game that SS1 was. Unfortunately, from there on out we don't see much that is actually creative. Cyberspace (which added another dimension to the original) was sadly not to be found in the sequel. Neither was the cool hacker protagonist from the original. What we get in its place is a very out-of-place skill/upgrade system. My guess is the game developer wanted to make an RPG but somehow got saddled with a FPS instead. Another sad removal from the original were the repair puzzles. These were actually puzzles in that you had to use your brain a little to solve them. In SS2 we're left only with puzzles where your character's skill (and NOT the player's) really matters. On the plus side, the SS series have the best stories of any FPS-style games hands down. This is basically a mediocre shooter with a great storyline and well-done creepiness."
4,Good fitted diapers,"I used these on my daughter who had very sensitive skin. I also used my own home-made fitted diapers and I have to say, that between those two choices, mine were more absorbent. I do like the fact that you can leave these un-covered sometimes. The exception would be heavy-wetting babies and sleep-times. I gave these four stars because, eventhough I do like these and would recomend them to anybody, I don't think they are very durable. Mine fell apart after about 1 year of using them. I know that mine probably didn't last as long because I didn't have that many of them(about a dozen) and washed them more often, (about 2 or 3 times a week). I used these as a over-night diaper w/ a doubler and covered with an Aristocrate (wool diaper cover). In over 2 years, I never had a leak."
5,A great diaper,I love these diapers! During the day you hardly need a cover and at night I use them with a Diaper Liner and the Happy Pants on the outside. I found the Happy Pants at diapersafari.com - they also carry the Kushies (at a better price)! Also look at the other products from Diaper Safari - they have an awesome selection plus fantastic customer service!
3,Not my favorite,"I've used a variety of cloth diapers in the past, and these were by far my least favorite. The main problem I had with them is that the elastic around the legs doesn't offer any support for holding accidents in. They never soaked through on the outside, but they always leaked around the legs. Which also causes some major skin irritation. I have found many other better brands of cloth diapers (for a cheaper price) that hold accidents in."
4,Nice cloth diapers,"I like these diapers because I think they are great for people who don't want to buy online and want something fitted. I would recommend a separate cover for them though. For the reviews that say the cloth diaper doesn't hold the diaper mess in around the legs. Eww! I have cloth diapered since child #2 and I frankly don't understand the desire to hold a diaper mess in the diaper for an extended period of time.With cloth diapers, you really do have to change the diapers a lot more. Disposables are more forgiving and keep a mess in but keeping the mess in is not good for baby's bottom. So cloth diapers, including Kushies, kind of force you to change the diapers frequently as you are supposed to do to keep baby's bottom rash free.Perhaps, I am in the minority, but I've had more of an issue with disposable diaper blowouts than with blowouts from the Kushies cloth diapers."
1,unhappy with kushies,"loved cloth,nice patterns, cost good, leaked urine. The fit was fine but found them to leak urine onto cloyhing and bedding even after short periods of wearing. Felt like they still needed rubber pants."
1,Terrible!,"I bought a 5-pack of these, in addition to the disposable liners and the extra-absorbing liners that were supposed to work overnight.I tried them on my daughter one day, when she was 3 months old. I put an extra absorbing liner in, two disposable liners, then even added some rubber pants on the outside. Not only was the diaper so big and bulky that, if she were able to crawl, I doubt she could have, but within 2 hours she was soaking wet even through the rubber pants. And she didn't even poop!Now that she's eating solid foods and drinking less milk, they may be more effective (I have no desire to try them again to see...), but they're supposed to be useful from birth.I felt it was a complete waste of $75 (the diapers plus all the liner costs). I'm all for saving the environment, but if I used these I'd have to change her every hour. It may help the environment, but doing all that laundry would create a drought where I live."
4,"OK, but not as pictured","The item we received was indeed a Bismarck tube, but folks not familiar with the item would be misled by the photo accompanying this product. Here's a link that better shows what this item is: [...]"
1,Cheaply made and the narrow tip fell apart after using it 3 times,It looks professional but its cheaply made and the narrow tip fell apart after using it 3 times.The Nordic Ware Cupcake Frosting Decorator Press works much better.
3,Thin frosting/filling required,Nice for making a small hole in your cupcakes or donuts however the filling should be pretty thin or jellied.If you are filling with frosting it is very hard to squeeze it through the small opening.
4,Holiday music,Really great CD if you like your Christmas music sung by the originals. Don't buy it if you like newer stuff...this CD has the oldies like Bing Crosby and Elvis...and no remixes!
3,Song list shown is not what you get,"As another buyer mentioned my CD does not match the song lists given here. The song by Charles Brown Please Be Home For Christmas was replaced by Merry Christmas, Baby by Charles Brown. Also the one I really wanted Winter Wonderland by Anne Murray was instead replaced by I Believe in Father Christmas by Greg Lake. So I was not too happy about that! Also the songs are not in the same order on the CD as that they are listed on the song list shown on Amazon. Other than that it does have some other great classic Christmas songs and my kids love it."
5,If You Want Classic & Traditional Christmas......,"If you want classic & traditional Christmas music, order this CD. It has all of the classics that brings back so many memories like Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, Fred Astaire, Frank Sinantra, Burl Ives and so many more. No wonder why it's calls 'Treasury of Christmas - Holiday Memories.'"
2,Budget item sold at premium price,"The packaging was substandard. The jewel cae didn't open properly and i had to put the cds in new jewel boxes. The paper insert was printed on high grade newsprint.I have bought better for less. Look around before buying this. I found better items at amazon for better prices.The sound quality was bad enough on my mono computer playback, on an actual sound systems it must be grating on the ears.I should return it. it just is a hassles at this price.I am returning it. Quality is garbage."
5,Still Amazing after all this time.,I listen to this CD all year round and needed a new one. It was priced right and ships free.
2,Not what I wanted,"The CD - Treasury, from Time-Life was not the one I wanted. I wanted the first Time Life Christmas collection."
1,Two of the same disc,"I would imagine the discs are good. i was very excited to listen to it on christmas morning. Disc Two seems good, I wouldn't know about disc one as I opened this on Christmas day to find two of disc 2. Nice."
1,Boring,"I am 38 years old and this CD bores me to tears. I really didn't hear many of these songs growing up. I guess from the reviews some people really like it, but none of the singers are from my era."
5,Every collection needs this one!,"I am 36 and my sister is 41 and we absolutely ADORE this one. We remember all of these from our childhood and it brought back so may wonderful memories. Bing Crosby, Dean Martin - we played my parents' ""albums"" over and over at Christmas and are so happy to each have this in our homes. I am so glad these songs were a part of my childhood. Definitely a must have!"
5,Fast service!!!,"Received my Time-Life Treasury of Christmas Holiday Memories CD this morning, 5Nov11. Excellent service.CD is exactly as advertised. Won't hesitate to order in the same manner again. Thanks for the greatproduct and service."
3,Not as good as the original,"A great Christmas CD but in terms of comparing it to the original, it falls short; I grew up listening to the original compilation and thought that by buying this new one, the best songs would be on it but I was wrong. I know that ""favorites"" are subjective so I will only be so bold as to say that I prefer the former version. In short this CD is still a festive and fun one at that!"
5,Essential for Mondern Managers,"Dr. Charles Ehin was one of my professors in the MBA program at Westminster College in Salt Lake City. I enjoyed his classes because he was enlightened and creative. His lectures were both fascinating and entertaining. He was concerned about getting the most from employees by motivating them in positive ways.This book was not required reading in his classes, but I read it anyway to improve my management style. It's a great reference book."
5,Something special,"Fans of Billy Crockett know all about his amazing guitar skills. This album once again demonstrates his guitar virtuosity, vocal talent and songwriting skills. There is always something in Billy's albums that touches my heart with poignancy and also a lot that makes me tap my feet. His music is unlike any other and it truly is God-given talent. I would actually rate this album 4.5 stars as it could have been a song or so shorter, but it is definitely worth the purchase price. As always, the quality of the recording is excellent. The album really is fun and ministers to the heart. A good one!"
5,another CD to be cherished,What a gift this man has for songwriting. His lyrics are meaningful and moving. His music is beautiful...melodies and harmonies that stay with you.
4,Well made and good deal but,"The Bostitch appears well made and it is a good deal with the included stapler. It will drive 1 3/4 nails easily although in cold weather it is necessary to increase the pressure to 100 psi. So far I have only nailed one square of shingles, but it has already misfired once - not a good sign. The misfire was due to a misfeed but did not seem to be a nail problem since I was using Bostitch brand 1 1/4 nails (not generics)."
1,Outdoor oscilating Fan,"I have returned 1 fan already because it was missing parts. There is no Packing material between much of the sections, so many parts are scratched. Sorry I bought it. So now I am fan #2 which arrived with the base all scratched due to the parts moving around in the box. I thought OK, I will just respray the base and call it good. I foolishly threw out the box. Now the fan will not oscillated after 2 days of partial use.Also the adjustable height rod is jammed . So now I have this giant fan 4 feet off the ground blows everything off the tables. Will have to order a 3rd fan and see if it will work any better. Buy something else with all the initial defects I wonder how long this fan is going to last."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"The parts to fan were not clearly marked so it made assembly hard. After assembly the fan only ran for a total of five minutes and then stopped. Needless to say, I had to return it for a refund."
3,when will the ORIGINAL greatest hits be available???,"I believe the most beautiful song (both words and vocals) I ever heard was his original ""After All"" but that version is only available in his original greatest hits CD. Does anyone know when that CD will ever be re-released ???? I am heartbroken that I can not get that song today! What is going on?? The version offered now does not have that great, slowly increased vibrato, that he used in the original and the timing of the song is different. I was so excited until I heard the change...I pray Ed will re-release those original ""Gems"" for those of us that love his music.Max"
3,Surpise!,"I ordered this CD from Ed Bruce's website, excited to get a CD of the songs I loved so long ago. The CD came signed by Ed Bruce which was very nice, but when I was playing the CD I was so surprised that the songs just didn't sound the same. Turns out these are just rerecordings of his greatest hits! The quality of the rerecordings is just not the same as the originals. Ed Bruce's voice is beautiful on the CD, but with the background music and cheap acoustics, the whole thing sounds like karaoke. It appears that his truly original hits aren't being printed anymore. To get a true recording of his greatest hits, you can either pay 80 dollars for some used tape, or you can pirate his music. I've never seen a better reason to start pirating!"
1,Bleck...,"The subject matter was very interesting, but I noticed so many obvious mistakes. It was so distracting. There was one section that was missing the last half of a descriptive paragraph. I have never seen a book like this before. It was like they published the book with out copy writing it. If you can get past that I'm sure you'll love it."
2,Tedious and meandering,"Years ago, Saberhagen published a series of short stories on berserkers which collectively became classics. Since then, his productivity on this idea has slowed. But he recently released this book.Sadly disappointing compared to his earlier work. Part of the reason may have been that his short stories intrinsically had to have tighter focus. Here, the plot meanders over a zany unearthly landscape. Perhaps Saberhagen was trying to show his ability in fashioning a truly bizarre arena. But it was hard to identify with any of the characters.Though the main character shows some potential. Akin to the Stainless Steel Rat, Slippy Jim diGriz, in Harry Harrison's novels.More to the point, people who read Berserker novels want to see descriptions of actions against the Berserkers. Not the tedious shilly shallying of this book.Saberhagen is capable of far better than this sloppy rendition."
3,Not the best in the Berserker series,"Fred Saberhagen is widely acknowledged as one of science fiction's foremost masters of military science fiction, especially with his acclaimed ""Berserker"" series. However, ""Berserker's Star"" is the worst installment I have seen so far, coming across as a poorly written ""Star Trek"" novel, than another exciting tome in Saberhagen's series. His two protagonists, Harry, the irascible merchant ship captain, and Lily, his passenger, didn't garner much enthusiasm or interest in either character from me. If you are a fan of Saberhagen's work, I would recommend skipping this novel and reading instead, his earlier, critically acclaimed works."
4,Awesome!,Simply the coolest Hiking book I've seen. Has all the info you need and is very well organized (by distance etc). VERY GOOD VALUE!
5,wonders of nature,"The author of this guide has put together a sensory smorgasbord for anyone who loves the outdoors. She details the flowers and plants you'll see (no more do you have to wonder what that fuzzy gray-green plant is, she tells you!), birds and other wildlife, challenges of the terrain, and where to find a spectacular view. Cross-referenced lists help you choose which hike to do (or helps you prioritize--I want to do all of them!) Best of all, she covers the damage from the 2003 wildfires around San Diego, so the book is way ahead of other guides right now. This guide took this New Englander from ""Man, southern California is so dry"" to amazement at the variety the San Diego area has to offer, from coastline to forest to mountains."
3,No False Signals,"Good and easy setup, No false signals in downtown or near storesGood performance on highway"
5,Excellent translations on sexual alchemy.,"This is a compendium of translations of over 20 classic Chinese texts on Taoist esoteric sexual practice. For those with this particular interest, I highly recommend it. There's no other book like it.This is not a `new-age relationships' book, nor a `light-reading sex-tips' book; it's a scholarly and faithful set of translations of Taoist texts originating from the second century B.C. through the early 1700's.These might be rather heady for the beginner, but if you've studied alchemical Taoism (especially the sexual aspect) from more modern sources - and would like to peruse some of the classics (from the 1000's of years that the Chinese have been studying this stuff), then this is THE book. It's extremely well written; the introduction alone is worth the price of the book."
5,Very complete. documented and Annotated,"This is a work of scholorship and not simply a book about the ancient Chinese view of sex. It's very complete and contains both usuful material for moderns and very interesting historical material regarding alchemy, Qi Gong and Chinese medicine as they relate to sex."
3,A Historical Resource,"I found this book to be in mildly poor taste.It says a lot about sources, morality, and translation fallibility. It also says a lot about ""orientalism"" and ""occidentalism.""My interest started as a bad Jack Nicholson joke. The interest grew when a middle age Chinese American computer programmer smugly commented on the superiority of Chinese distinctions of love and lust.There is a time and a place for pressure points, tantra, and domestic order.The book is well sourced - and is thus a good historical resource - much in the same way as an old phrenology book or a 18th century barber's manual.Historians might enjoy - but there is so much other literature available.I would have preferred to read ""The Three Kingdoms"" a Lu Hsun anthology, a treaty by Wang Chung or ""The Art of Love"" again if I had my time back."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I think it needs to profundize more on the analytical methods, after all it is supposed to be experimental, right?"
3,"Good Price, Fast Shipping, but...","...I would have liked to have known it was not a genuine Lennox brand replacement filter. I'm sure Aprilaire is a fine filter brand (and it fits perfectly), but more info in the product description would be helpful."
5,Karin: the lovable vampire,"Do you like vampires? If so, you may like this dvd. This dvd is all about a life of a vampire who is not your normal vampire. Karin (who's the main character) is a vampire who likes: garlic, and the sun, which are normal vampires worst nightmares.What is there to say about this dvd? well, there is alot of comedy, romance, and oh yeah, vampires. This dvd includes extra content of the textless main theme song and it has trailers which are very intresting. I don't want to tell what the main plot line is so if you are intrested at all go and get this dvd. All I can say is it has comedy and romance in it which makes this dvd very entertaining."
5,This book was awsome!,"I am 9 years old and love to draw. This book tells you how to draw a lot of famous cartoons. Some of the ones I like the best are PopEye, Flintstones and Scooby Doo. If you like to draw, you will enjoy this book."
4,Cartoon stars,"The Lee Ames series of books are good if you already have the basics of drawing down and some minor artist skills. They show how to take your basic skills and make some neat stuff. But this book is basically 1 page to a cartoon star, and about 6 drawings on the page to get a completed look. For some simple ones it works but on others it gets a little tricky. No text instructions here, just the drawings which you are just copying. If you want to LEARN how to draw and get the basic skills first whether you are kid or an adult, the books by Jack Hamm and Ed Emberly are the best place to start. They can make anyone an artist. Then come back to books like Ames."
5,One glaring omission,"This book is great fun! I have enjoyed all the different characters covered in the book. Some have been flashbacks to a misspent youth watching too many Saturday morning cartoons. Others are completely new and alien to me. The one criticism I would have of this book is no Betty Rubble. The have Fred and Wilma, Barney and Dino, freakin' Dino! but no Betty. Otherwise I have had a blast with this book and expect a lot more enjoyable time working on the material in it."
2,Don't chime at all.,"These bells are well made and look nice, but they don't chime even in a very strong wind. I think the clapper is too heavy for the wind catcher, so it can't work up enough momentum to swing it enough to hit the bell. I moved them around to try to find a windier spot, but even in 30mph gusts it didn't ring at all."
2,The chimes do not function even with strong wind.,"This item is terribly designed. The bells in the middle are fully separate from the dragonflies so that they will never collide (unless you're in heavy gale force winds, but hey, if you're trying to listen to soothing chimes in the middle of a hurricane, you have some other issues).Furthermore, the bell at the bottom is very heavy, and the wind catcher below it (which is supposed to catch the wind and make the bell chime) is extremely light and made of plastic. The heavy bell reduces the momentum of the string, which makes it impossible for the collision to occur, so the chime will never happen (unless, again, you're in hurricane-force wind scenario).It's a beautiful look, but it just doesn't do what it was intended to do. This bell will never chime."
2,Nice but small,Windbell is very nice quality but the picture posted makes it look much larger than it's actual size. Difficult to see the windbell from only 10-ft away.
3,Cheap Plastic,"This was a beautiful wind chime, but the bottom piece is made of plastic making the whole wind chime seem cheap. It was going to be a gift for my mother. I hope they will except the return even though it has been opened."
2,not much to it...too lightweiight and cheaply made to make much noise,This windchime is really not much to look at...and especially nothing to 'listen' to. Occasionally...in higher winds...you may hear a slight 'tink' sound...but on a regular basis...with normal breezes; 'nothing'. It gives the appearance of something you can buy at a dollar store.
1,Travels to the Interior by M. Basho,"The book is a classic. The one I received was well used and underlined. The seller was not prompt in sending it, but did so after I wrote a query to Amazon."
4,"Many Ideas, good visuals",I found the first pages with what was needed helpful for a beginner to get started. There are many ideas to choose from and use of things around the house or easily purchased. Only criticism is the font is too small which makes reading the text very tedious.
2,pants press,"Years ago these presses were great. Now after short use they fail to do their job. The pants have irregular wrinkles and do not press well. Called the new company that imports them and found that there are no replacement parts for this. The price is steep for an irregular press. Suggest that you look for a different brand, or just send the pants to the cleaners. lglass"
2,Doesn't press,"Pants did not come out very well. It presses, but leaves many unwanted creases despite laying the pants flat on the board as instructed."
5,Replacing after 30 years!,I am replacing my Corby press after 30 years! I use it often - 4 or 5 times a week for suit pants and casual slacks. It does a fine job. I hope the newer one will be as good and last at least half as long as my original one!
2,good reference source but,my library has it in print and I Can use It online from home for free. So why should I or others with library cards pay?
5,Simply Amazing,"The Odds of Winning from the Churchills is an very refreshingly original rock album. It has been awhile since the release of Big Ideas, but the Odds Of Winning was well worth wait. This is truly an record that you can play over and over again falling in love with evey song more and more each time you hear them. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is tired of the same old sounds and wants to hear the very unique amazing sound that the Churchills bring!"
4,"Twelve mellow, melodic, and emotional `date' songs","The Good""Sometimes Your Best Isn't Good Enough"" is a mid-tempo track about tough break-ups. The chorus is layered with melodic multi-part harmonies. ""I'm a Sucker for a Girl in Uniform"" pays homage to the girls in blue and the ones in camouflage. No joking here, these guys are dead serious. Watery guitar tones and soft vocals portray the emotional pain of ""Do You Want Me to Go Away."" Broken promises and heartbreak seem to be a recurring theme for The Churchills' music, and ""It Only Hurts When I Breathe"" is no different. The chorus hook is sure to elicit plenty of powerful feelings. ""There Never Going to Find Me"" is where the group really rocks out by kicking up the tempo and guitar fuzz.The BadThese songs are great for poignant dramatic scenes on television, but when they're run back to back, they get a little repetitive.The VerdictTwelve mellow, melodic, and emotional `date' songs wrapped up into convenient three-minute packages."
4,The Summer of Prophet,"This CD hasn't left my player (well, not much, anyway) since I got it. The only way I can describe this fellow is: Chuck Prophet is the musical love child of a triangle involving Lucinda Williams, Jim Morrison and Bobbie Gentry. (In fact, save Jim, they should all go on tour together) But, I digress...the lyrics are chewy and profuse, the tunes are simple and catchy (just right for rolling around the streets of summer with the windows rolled down), and sexy vibes drip from Chuck's vocals. To this woman, this man is one of the most appealing singers around right now. His songs, voice and guitar work pull at my heart (and places below that). Tell me you don't think so too."
5,Brilliant,"This album was my introduction to CP and wow, I was blown away. I'm typically a twitchy listener and begin hitting skip buttons way too fast but this time there was no need. The entire album was enthralling, his songs have grace and lyrical substance but are infused with a healthy dose of humour and irony they capture moods, fleeting emotions and bittersweet moments brilliantly.I would have no hesitation in recommending this album to anyone!"
3,why the hype?,"I bought this disc specifically because of ""Summertime Thing"". Love this song...well written, great hooks....one of those timeless gems. Having read other reviews, was expecting more. And while it's still a solid CD, it, at least in my mind, doesn't live up to the hype piled on it in other reviews. I think Danny O'Keefe's - ""The Day Today"", or Joe Henry's ""Trampoline"", or maybe even more obscure, James Reyne's ""Any Day Above Ground"", and not to go on and on, Indio's ""Big Harvest"". All of the afore mentione discs are far stronger than ""No Greater Love"". Everyone's entitled to their opinion, this was mine."
4,Wow,"CD is definitely solid. I just saw him here in Dallas and I was very impressed. He has a great voice and the band is a very good suppporting cast. I'd recommend this and go see him live for sure...you won't be disappointed! Try tracks #5,#9,and #11.It's very difficult to put him in one certain genre. I am not sure about the alt-country label. He plays a tele with some twang but he's got so much more...great range. He's getting bigger and bigger with the ""Summertime Thing""...hopefully he'll get the atttention he deserves."
3,Thinking outside of the box,"I am a experienced security officer. I felt that the authors touched on many good ideas for security,the public,police agencies,and corporate America. The book as I see it was written to promote discussion,debates and brainstorming about the possibilities of the ideas in this book.I believe this book should be read to start all people thinking outside the box on these issues.Dan"
5,This Book will help Shopping Malls prevent Crime!,"I really beleave if people read this new book, our Shopping malls, Hospitals and schools will be much more safe and secure! Crime Prevention, and terrorist Attacks prevention will not happen in these places folks unless we all read this easy to understand book! I recommend this book to everyone that sees it!"
3,A slice of Hippie life,"Shiva's head band is venerable Hippie band from the greater Austin Texas region. These guys are the real thing. Spenser Perskin is the violinist and spiritual leader of the band. He is brilliant on this recording. His playing covers the gamut from blues, to jazz and a little bluegrass thrown in for style. If you have nostalgia for the 60's or if wonder what was really like buy this recording. If you like really original hyper-creative music you will also enjoy this recording. It defies catagorizaton."
3,No Adapter Yet!,I took my chance on gettings these radios hopeing that theywould surely have the problem fixed buy now. I received them today and had forgot about the reviews about the missing adapters until I tried to charge them. Sure hope they get the problem fixed.
2,super sweet,The delivery was prompt. The product is attractively packaged. My students found the strawberry taste to be overpowered by the sweetness. The candy was too sweet for their liking. Recommend this for the novelty not necessarily for the taste.
1,Fraud!,"Watch out! this is an imitation of Chinese Good luck strawberry candy. Its not strawberry, its some clear strange smelling candy."
1,Not what product is advertised as...,"I bought these candies, and they were not what they are suppose to be. I got hooked on these here local from my accupuncturist and these were not the candies that she had. These were green, (suppose to be strawberry flavored) and an awful taste, could not tell what they tasted like to be honest. If I could give it no stars I would!"
4,When I see these.. It must be Chinese New Years!,"The only times we ever eat these is when it's Chinese new years. Our family buys a bunch of Chinese New Years candies and puts it in a big bowl for us (kids). These as I recall are real sweet and has a slight strawberry flavor. Usually Asians prefer candies that aren't too sweet.. But these I loved, maybe it's because the same day I eat these, I get money from my relatives!"

4,Good lens,This is a good lens. I tried it both at the widest and the longest. The performance is good. It is a very handly lens as it covers most of the range that one faces during normal photography.
3,"Detector is very good, but the light indicators were faded/gone","Every feature is very good, but but the light indicators were faded/gone within one month. I don't know whether I got the defect item or the poor quality of indicators. So I decided to request the replacement for Amazon.com"
2,Cruzer Micro Disappointment,"I got my Cruzer Micro in Sept. of 2004. It worked beautifully until 6 months later, then half of my files became corrupted on the disk. I did some research on this and found out that it has also happenend with other 128mb cruzer micro flash drives. I have also read that San Disk will charge you a $40 fee for a program that is supposely supposed to reformat the drive. This is going into the garbage and I am sticking with a new brand."
2,"Okay, but get more for your money","I bought this unit at Wal-Mart because I wanted something simple without having to wait for shipping to get it. I was moderatley disappointed with it.For the most part it was the small stuff, the range was less then I wanted and the voice comes in the earlier 1750 model and it doesn't pick up L2 and L3 lasers. I used it for about two days and took it back. I ordered a Uniden 987, and I must say that I have been quite pleased with that product, and I highly recomend it."
3,good for cash.. :),well...i bought the whisler de 1765c and the cobra 9210 ..so guess which is better..?? well the whislter detects the signal far more earlier than the cobra....the whisler includes a compass .. the cobra doesnt...although its usless ...whisler has 3 city modes and highway....the cobra has only city and highway....the cobra is silver colored which reflects on the windshield.....well my words... go for it...its good for its price performance and options... but i am sure it will be like all other detectors ..fails to detect the laser guns before its too late....it should detect it from refracted and reflected signals from other cars infront of u ...any way.... i beleive its a good one... go for it..for any question i'm always avaliable... e-mail me.....@....com
3,Good entry-level model at low price,"Whistler is a respected vendor in the radar detector market. This is a model that won a few awards when it was first introduced in 2002. The low price is because it is being closed out, although you can still find it available online in the 60-100 dollar range.I don't think you can find a better detector for under 100 dollars, so unless you are willing to spend 150 or more this is a good entry-level model with the following features:* A digital compass* High-visibility text* Loud audio alerts* Highway and dual city modes* Quiet and auto-quiet modes* All BandTM protection including VG-2 which will conceal your detector from police* Battery saver that automatically shuts off your detector if you forgetBe aware that this model does not detect or offer protection against the most up to date POP technology, but if you want it be prepared to spend 3-4 times more."
4,Whistler DE1765C Radar,"This unit has exceeded my expectations for what I considered a VERY REASONABLE price. I have always been reluctant to purchase a mid-priced detector, but I couldn't resist the ""close out"" price of this unit. Very satisfied!"
5,Whistler DE1765C Radar Detector,Extremely good ratio money / quality. Easy to install and set up. Very sensitive and accurate device. Lots of functions.
1,Complete garbage,"First off, this unit is HUGE. My 1991 uniden was smaller. The overall quality of this detector is poor. During a hot summer, the unit actually separated at the seam and warped, which made it impossible to turn on or off without significant effort. To turn it on/off I actually had to smack it against my leg so the warped button could contact the leads. On top of that, the fine piece of engineering that is supposed to keep it on the windshield doesn't work. Since it warped in the sun, every time I turned or hit a bump, the unit would fall of the mount and come flying at me or my passenger.Performance wise, it worked marginal. I received many false readings. The compass is a nice feature. Again, the unit is huge and the display screen is quite small and difficult to read. The dot matrix red is very 80s.Avoid. This is Whistler's piece of junk model."
4,Good Value,I've had this product for about a month and I am pleased with it.For the price it is a very good value. Yes their are better ones out there if your willing to pay twice as much or more.
4,Just what I needed,"There are other, more expensive detectors out there that will do more, but this detector accomplishes just was I need.It has saved me plenty of times, the range is good too.The only drawback is the display is hard to see when its bright out."
5,The Murderers Are Among Us,"Made in crumbling, bomb-scarred East Berlin in 1946, ""Murderers"" is not only Germany's first postwar production, but a haunting film of disillusionment and atonement. The film's stark power comes from the unlikely bond that develops between Susanne, a camp survivor who craves normalcy, and hard-drinking, guilt-ridden Hans, who cannot return to his practice because he no longer believes humanity is worth the effort of sparing. Filmed in an expressionistic style, ""Murderers"" powerfully dramatizes the rebirth of hope amid literal ruins, human and otherwise."
1,This book [is bad],"This book is a compilation of 8 short stories, some based on traditional Jewish tales.I'd give this book a 1 star rating out of five. Some of the stories are mildly interesting, but most of them are too old( take place in Middle Ages or before) for my liking. There isn't much description either, so you can't envision the picture in your mind the author wants you to. Some of the stories do not have a plot and those that do have unusual endings or don't provide a solution to the problem encountered in the story. I really cannot his book even got a slight chance at possibly maybe being a Newberry Medal nominee."
2,A blast from the Past,"I hadn't realized how long ago and how young I was when Crusader Rabbit was on TV. I had forgotten that it was in black and white! I think I will give it to my grandson and granddaughter, in hopes that they might enjoy it. It was fun to take a trip back to my youth for a little while.I was gratified to learn that the two main writers of this (and ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"") were alumni of my alma mater, Cal Berkeley. It made me more of a fan."
3,pet clippers,"The clippers themselves seem to work well enough, but the trimming guards are nearly impossible to keep on, to the extent that my wife was in favor of returning it."
1,terrible clippers,These clippers are terrible.The plastic hair guides keep falling off when trying to clip my dogs hair.I tried all of the guides with the same result.I would not recommend these clippers to anybody.Going to return these clippers after just one use.
3,For Light Duty Only,"If you have only one dog and groom him two or three times a year, this is a good product. However, I have two dogs that need trimming 2-3x a year. The product is too noisy, in my opinion. Plus, the motor burned out after 2-3 years, which, considering its light usage, I think is unacceptable. Light duty, ok. Medium duty, keep looking."
5,Highly recommended for home clipping,"I had never clipped either dog or human before, but decided to try doing my Standard Schnauzer at home. He is the terror of all local groomers: they complain that he struggles the entire time, so it's been a headache for them and expensive for me. After researching home-use clippers at the Groomers BBS, I decided on this Andis clipper set and I am delighted. It is so quiet that my dog all but ignored it (except around his ears) and it cut through his very shaggy coat like butter. This clipper made easy a job that I had feared would be disastrous.The comb attachments help to blend in the short and long coat areas on the Schnauzer. I followed the advice of the pros and bought an extra blade so that I could quickly swap them as they grew hot."
3,wrong voltage.,it did not state what voltage it was. Australia is 240v. if you post to Australia you need to send the correct voltage.
2,ok,"these seem ok. not great, NOT worth $60. we have yet to find any clippers which cut our cocker's hair to our liking. good luck"
2,Andis 21420 clipper,Expected this expensive clipper to handle any dog hair. It rejected my cocker-poo hair with all attachments or none. I had to hold the hair between my fingers and move the blade through it to get it to cut the hair at all. I used to cut my cocker with a cheap clipper that came with cissors and comb plus attachments. I would not recommend this clipper for a long hair dog. It might work on a rat terrier or fox terrier short haired dog. I'll use scissors from now on.
3,Pretty good clippers,"These clippers did a pretty good job, considering we were new to this grooming process. We had trouble with our cocker spaniel's thick hair. The clippers just wouldn't cut properly through, and we ended up using scissors on a lot of it. Having said that, they were really great at grooming her short hair, the smaller blade, that is. She ended up looking really beautiful, and we were amazed! The clippers stayed relatively cool, weren't loud, and our cocker was OK with the whole process. For the price, a pretty good deal. We suspect we need a different a size blade for her thicker hair."
2,Great while it works,"I have a Shi Tzu and I was spending more on hair cuts for the dog than me. While I may be willing to do that, my dog was too happy to leave the groomer and spent a day or so very sad from what appeared to be a high-stress encounter. I got thisAndis 21420 Pro-Animal Detachable Ceramic Blade Clipper Kitand gave my dog a haircut and immediately noticed the happy mood (relieved perhaps) right after. Now after several haircuts my dog is so relaxed that falls asleep while I groom, which may be attributed to the low noise of this clipper. My dog is happy and I am saving a ton.-Update-Eleven months later and this trimmer no longer works. It was about four times on a single very small dog."
3,Okay for the money,"It was my first clipper actually labeled for ""animals"" but I've actually cut my dog's fur for years. I've had human clippers work comparable to this and not near as heavy nor unwieldy and they were cheaper. It cut my shih tzu pretty well but not like I expected. I expected the cutter to make it quick and easy compared to the cheap clippers I'd been using and it was only somewhat better and still took way too long to completely finish the dog so all fur was even. Some places I had to go over several times to get the clipper to trim, not sure why it wouldn't catch the hair in places but I only rate it as average. It did get quite warm but didn't overheat. I'll keep an eye out if the clipper gets worse in the next several clippings and change my review if necessary. There has to be ones out there that A. don't cost a small fortune, and B. make it easy to keep my dog groomed. This will do for now but I'm still searching."
4,Works great on my Blue Heeler mix.,"These are the first clippers I've ever bought/used on my dog, who has a thick coat. I was happy after using them. They got the job done easily and hopefully many more times to come. They did get very hot, but that might be normal, I don't know."
1,Not worth it (I'm returning it),"I recently purchased the Andis 21420 clippers from Amazon. Unfortunately, after one use I am going to return it.None of the four supplied clipper guards stay on. They are supposed to clip on or snap into place, but they don't. Not even close to staying on. I could turn the clippers over, shake it once and it would fall off. We tried to bend one of the attachment clips to get it to stay on well enough to use. It did not work and kept falling off.I ended up going back to my old $30 clippers from Target to finish the job.As far as cutting power goes, there is nothing outstanding about it when compared to my old $30 clippers.However, there are two good things about it. It has a long electrical cord and it is quiet.I would not recomend at all. Perhaps it was a defective item, but I am returning this item immediately."
1,did not cut hair at all,"I bought this mostly from the reviews so I thought I would warn anyone with a dog who has any kind of a thicker coat that this did not cut my dog's hair at all, not even a little bit. I tried adjusting the blades, etc. Nothing. super disappointed."
4,Works fine on my terriers,We were looking for a good quality dog clipper that would work well on our terrier's very fine hair. This one works great.
4,Great for Cocker Spaniel,I bought this less then a month ago and used it on my two dogs. It worked great on the Cocker Spaniel. She looks like we got her proffessionally groomed. Then we used it on our Bischon/king charles spaniel mix. His hair is softer and just different and it was a little more difficult. The trimmer never got hot or clogged. Both dogs got groomed and the first haircut session for them basically paid for the trimmer and shipping. I look forward to using them again in 6 weeks.
2,Not Impressed,"We had issues with the blade clogging and it simply did not perform very well. It was considerably loud and the quality belies the ""Pro"" designation.Item was returned."
3,Cricket,"I used this clipper on a Miniature Schnauser and it worked ok. I previously had another type of clipper that finally wore out, however, that clipper did a better and faster job, it was an Oster. I was hoping this would be just as good, but it is not heavy duty enough. I would say for the price it is fine."
3,Cuts but not as good as I had hoped!,Andis 21420 Pro-Animal Detachable Ceramic Blade Clipper. --> Well I was surprised that this Andis model did not cut very well for me. My dog is small to medium. She is a Tibetan Spaniel and her overcoat is about 4 inches in length. The clippers get bogged down on her hair and it just could not do the job.
3,not overly impressed,"Previous to this purchase, I was using a human hair clipeer on my labradoodle. It worked great for about 5 or 6 haircuts, then it jammed up. I did some research and decided on this model...seemed like it had decent reviews and a decent price. I've used it once on my dog. My first impression is that I'm not very impressed. I don't feel like it cut as cleanly as my old clipper. I went over and over the same area, but it still seemed to leave ""tracks"". After I was done I took the blade off, as instructed, to clean it out. It was easy to remove, but for the life of me, I couldn't get that blade back on the clipper. Frustrated, I put everything away with the blade stuck in the box. I will have to enlist a more technical helper to get the blade back on before the next cut. I will give it another try, but I'm left wondering if the cheaper brand at the big box pet stores would do just as well or better. To be continued..."
1,Not what I expected,"Bought this based on all the reviews, and it was not at all what we expected, it was loud, the blade was palstic, and it did not cut very well. I would not recomend this prodcut at all. Amazon return service was quick, easy and painless, the reason why I will continue to purchase items from amazon.com"
2,Too noisy,"I wanted a good brand so I bought this one. It was to shave matts from my cats fur. It is so noisy, it scares the cat and there is no way to use unless you have someone hold her down. I try it once and it stress my cat out terribly."
2,It didnt work as expected,"I used this on my dog and used the smallest blade attachment. I had to go over the same spot on his hair multiple times to get it to the desired length. The blade that cuts is plastic and looks cheap. The only good thing is it comes in a nice little case. I would rather have a nice trimmer and keep it in a plastic bag. If I could do it again, I would just buy a wahl trimmer used for humans. I think that would work much better because they are known for making nice quality hair trimmers."
2,butter cutters,I was greatly disappointed in these shears. I have two persian cats and two manx cats. these shears would not cut the matted manx fur and they grabbed the persian fur intermittently and pulled it. It did cut the top of cat ok but wasn't good on belly or legs.
2,Not for thick coats,I have a Wheaten Terrier and a cheap pair of human clippers work better on her than these. I bought these due to the fast blade change feature which is great. The blades get very hot and are extremely loud - which is protested when trying to trim near the ears. I have to very slowly to get them to cut. The blades make an aweful racket when in use - almost like they are not inserted correctly and are loose. I missed the window for returns or I would have sent them back.
5,Awesome.,This clipper works realy well and the blades come off nicely also it is easy to clean. It came on time and undamaged also it looks great and is a cute purple. So far I have only shaved two dogs with it but one of the dogs had really long and thick fur. It clipped through it really well but you have to take off the gaurd blade. But as long as you purchase a #5 blade it will be the perfect length. It comes with a #10 blade but that cuts the hair really short. To sum it all up this is a great clippers and I am lovin it!
4,Good for my little Pom mix.,These clippers get the job done. It is all about the blades when it comes to a good cut. Good blades make for a good cut. I like that these clippers can switch to different size blades easy. Don't think you can use the stupid plastics Comb things to make a good cut. For the price these are ok I would not want to use these to clip bigger dogs. For my 12lb Pom these work well.
5,Great clipper for home use,"I have two Australian shepherds I take to the groomer at the beginning of summer. Tired of spending $100 a month, I decided to buy the Andis Pro. I used a Wahl I'd gotton at Walmart but it just was'nt doing the job. Since my dogs had already clipped short for the summer, the Andis clipper worked great. It's quiet and cut through their coats like butter. I did'nt have any problem with overheating. I don't know how well it would work if they had'nt already been clipped considering the thick undercaot of Aussies. I intend to keep them short all year round here in Texas since they are inside dogs and love being cool. A once monthly clipping is perfect and the Andis does what I want. I would buy it again. I'm sure a professional groomer would want something in the $200 range, but for home use it's ideal for me!"
2,not good for thick coats,"i bought these clippers at petsmart. i even bought extra andis ceramic blades. unfortunately these clippers work great for very fine hair, but are useless on thicker, wiry or curly coats. you can forget about shaving mats with these. i'm in the market for better clippers."
1,Couldn't cut hot butter.,"Sorry but no matter what I tried this would not cut the coat on my Giant German Spitz or my standard Pomeranian. Trimming the outer coat was okay but the undercoat on both bogged the cutter down to a standstill. It's not a total loss. I use it to give myself a ""high and tight"" haircut. Semper Fi."
1,"Sluggish performance, Broke in just over a year","I used these clippers to groom one miniature poodle. After 6 months I noticed a marked decrease in performance, and just after a year the motor wouldn't turn on anymore. I replaced it with the Oster Golden A5 single-speed clippers and immediately noticed a huge difference. It now takes half the time to trim my dog because the Oster clippers cut more quickly and smoothly than the Andis (even when the Andis was new, it never worked as well as the Oster does). Spend the extra money for a much better product."
2,Warning - Product Picture and Description does not match the model number,"I purchased this product (Andis 21420)and the product that was shipped to me is not the same as what's shown in the picture. Also, the description is different. I called Andis Headquarters and they confirmed that the image displayed on Amazon does not match the product number and the description is wrong as well. If you order this product you will be shipped the product displayed if you look up ""B00063MRN4"" on Amazon.com - it's a different color and the switch is even different on the clippers. Also, the clippers you will receive will be ""Pro Animal"" clippers, not ""Pro Pet"" clippers, and there is a difference. Please call Andis Headquarters before you make your purchase. I haven't had a lot of experience with these clippers yet, but I am disappointed that I did not receive the clippers I was expecting (the black one displayed in the picture). The Amazon advertisement is very confusing/misleading."
2,Very disgruntled customer having purchased an inferior made item,"The Andis 21420 Pro-animal Detachable Ceramic Blade Clipper Kit was purchased 2/13/2012, and was not used for the first time until today, 4/29/2012, due to the warmer weather conditions. Three short strokes were made with the clippers; it stopped, and that was the end of the Andis 21420. I am disgusted with having paid $63.83 for this item, only to find something of such poor quality. I was under the impression 'Andis' was a good product, and even more disgusted with Amazon's return policy!! By the way 'hate the item' seems an inappropriate rating question!Don Miguez"
5,Great Clippers,I have been using a cheaper cordless set up clippers for the last few years. When they finally died I decided to look around for a better and more powerful set. After looking at several different sets and reading other reviews I decided on the Andis 21420. I am not disappointed. I have used them twice and I have a dog with thick hair. The work much better than what I had before and they are relatively quite. My dog is a bit sensitive the sounds around him but this did not bother him. I worked with him for quite a while and I did not feel the clippers really get heated up like the previous set. It was a bit of a challenge to get use the the cord but well worth the trade off. Give these a try I you will not be disappointed and I found Amazon had the best price on these as well after looking around.
5,"Wonderful product, great price!","We've been trying to groom our dogs ourselves but needed a nice, quiet trimmer. This one is great! And it cost less than one trip to the groomer for our two mini schnauzers!"
5,Clippers,"Very good, as advertized and well worth the cost. I will recommend this style of clippers to anyone that is wishing to groom there pets at home. We have not tried these on cats, only dogs."
3,Cuts Okay,"I'm a licensed beautician here in Michigan and have always wanted a set of clippers for my dogs. Well, I splurged and finally bought the Andis 21420. I didn't waste anytime in giving my Peek-a-poo COCO a trim. I was surprised at first to notice that the kit DID NOT contain any oil. Fortunately, I already had some on hand. The clippers cut okay, but for the price, you can't ask for any better-trust me!Marcia G"
4,"Great product, even for my hairy 70 lb dog!","My dog has very long, thick hair and I was able to shave him to a quarter of an inch long, maybe shorter, with ease and completely painless. Yes, it took awhile, maybe an hour to an hour and a half, but it never burnt out on me. I'm quite pleased with this product and so is my dog!"
2,Its OK...but not as good as i hoped!,"I was very excited about these clippers after reading all the great reviews, but was somewhat disappointed by the performance. I shave my chow mix and pappillon regularly and recently broke the clippers i have used forever (a walmart brand) and needed a new pair. I read all the instructions before getting started, and was excited to see how they worked. Well, they got extremely hot to touch within just a few minutes and they were very nosy. A little disapointed by this product. They did, however, cut very well and even, they just get TOO HOT TOO QUICK! I know others have had luck with these clippers...and perhaps i just received a bad pair."
5,Great for Cats,"Thankfully the reviews I read helped me choose this clipper for my mainecoon kitty who frequently gets matts and I cant always brush them out. I decided to clip her for the summer months and get her all cleaned up and cooled off and this clipper never got hot, it didnt pull her hair or cut her very delicate thin skin (of course I was very careful when getting close to her skin). I am very pleased how beautiful it goes through her fine hair with the #10 it comes with. She looks great, feels great and I recommend this because of the ceramic blade and how wonderful it cuts."
4,Fantastic Product,"My female Wheaten Terrier has a VERY thick coat. While I can scissor cut my male Wheaten, my girl just looks horrible and uneven. Not to mention, the bad scissor cut takes forever with her coat. With the Andis Clippers, I had her trimmed down in no time and she looks worlds better. I have had difficulty with her legs, hence the 4 stars. It is likely ""user error"" and with time I'll get it figured out.As an added bonus, the Andis Clippers are made in the USA."
2,Not for long haired cats,"Bought this product and the 7fc blade based on talking to Andis directly. Do not buy these for long haired thick coat cats. They do no better than your average clippers. Im sure they work great for course coats, but not for thick fine hair. Im basically just disappointed with the information Andis gave me about their product."
4,awesome clippers,"these clippers are great, i had bought 3 different ones before this purchase. wish i would of find these sooner, i would of saved quite a bit of money. this was my first purchase on amazon, i am very happy."
4,Good so far,I used it to trim my Cocker Spanial and over all it did a great job. I give it 4 stars because hair does get stuck between the plastic and the clipper (much to the discomfort of my dog)even though I bathed her and brushed her before trimming.
2,NOT HAPPY,"After having used an Oster 5 Turbo for 3 years, I purchased this Andis Pro-Animal Detachable Ceramic Blade Clipper Kit, mainly because the Oster is a little unwieldy. The Andis is quieter, possibly because the rpm's are slower, and it's lighter, but it also doesn't cut very well. I shouldn't need to make several swipes over my miniature poodles' faces in order to get a nice smooth look, but it takes 4 to 7 swipes before I can move on to the next line.A phone call to the company met with a rather unsympathetic and indifferent customer service rep. She made a perfunctory apology laced with a hint of cynicism. Chilly... Too bad. This has chilled me toward Andis in general.Anybody wanna buy a used one? Have I got a deal for you! Call me."
2,Didn't like,"I was not impressed by this one. It starts with Kami's dance. There was very little Bollywood/Indian movements in it and not good instructions. This type of teaching is ""I'll show you the moves and you should just be able to do it"".Moria's section is better she explains the story behind her dance. Her facial expressions don't work for this type of dance though. I have watched a lot of Indian dancing and she just doesn't have it yet. I realize it's a melding of the two types of dance and maybe this is how she wants it to look. But to me it just looks like she's scared or struggling with the facial expressions. FYI - facial expressions are a HUGE part of Indian dance."
3,The Right Wrong Turn,"The 3 movies in this series are overall very good but as they progressed they got worse. 1 was definitely the best, 2 was really good and 3 lost something. It could have been the overall plot which was a little lame but it is watchable. I bought all 3 just to have the complete series so if that doesn't matter to you, get the first 2 only. Hopefully, there will be a number 4."
4,A mixed collection of movie music,"For the price, this CD is a great bargain. The musical selections, as you might expect, are mixed in quality ranging from extraordinary to so so, the balance being worthwhile and interesting. Sonically the CD is excellent."
1,Needs a new title,This book was a waste of trees. It should be called how the United States sucks and anyone else's international politics are better. Rourke hates the United States and has been lucky enough to have some American University professors agree with his ridiculous way of thinking. A book on international politics should at least attempt to give examples of politics going on throughout the world instead of concentrating on Rourke's obvious problems with the United States and it's foreign policy etc. I am glad I will have graduated and not have to look at the 13th edition's love fest with the Obama administrations attempt at foreign policy. I don't know where this guy is from but if he's not from Europe he should move there...the U.S. is much too good for you.
1,Cannot believe I was required to buy this book,"This book is terrible. Every chapter begins with at least one Shakespeare quote which leads one to wonder whether this man spends more time considering politics or indulging in sonnets. The book is structured to make international relations appear as Shakespearean dramas which becomes extremely annoying after the first five pages. The references are vague, many terms left undefined, and somehow beyond the condescending tone of the book he finds a way to make every sentence that actually contains important information structurally unbearable. If I did not have really smart friends who are majoring in International Affairs this book would convince me that such majors are a joke."
2,High Beam,"I'm not a user of these headlamp bulbs, but as another driver encountering these headlamps on the road, they are like piercing laser beams. If you want to see better, use the standard headlamps, save $$, and USE HIGH BEAMS only when necessary. ThanX."
2,SYLVANIA has reached a new low!,"Having grown up in a gas stations, service shops and the race tracks in the Midwest and west coast I have never seen anything as crude, unprofessional and amateurish as these head lights. Never in over 40 years as an active car enthusiast have I seen the low quality that was used to produce these lights. I have probably changed 500 headlights in my life time and never once did I see one with glue all around the lens. It looks like they were recycled and poorly at that. There are buff scars all over the lenses, glue globs all over the lenses and as questionable as the manufacturing I have no faith in performance or duty life. It these were $2.00 lights on one of the auction sites I would expect the workmanship, not full price, name brand and a reputable brand at that. Not impressed, bet they don't last a month...."
4,Great for baking if you have food allergies!,"This product is great when used in baking. I've been using this for the past 3 years and have made numerous batches of cupcakes, muffins, coffee cakes, birthday cakes, etc. My son has had severe food allergies for the past 8 years; none of his classmates even know that the baked goods I take to class are egg and dairy free! I do usually double the amount for each egg (2 tsp/2 Tablespoon of water) and I only use recipes that call for 1 or 2 eggs. You also need to use a whisk and whip the ""no egg"" with the water thoroughly until it is frothy and thickened, then mix it with the oil and other liquid then add to the dry ingredients. It works great; people are always asking me for my recipes using this stuff. :)"
3,no egg,"I believe this works better for cooking in recipes. If you try and make it as an egg dish, it does not taste good, in fact it's really bad."
1,does this stuff really work??,This review is based on only using this product once according to the directions. I used it in a brownie recipe in place of real eggs. The brownies didn't fully cook after 25 minutes and I wasn't going to bake them any longer. They were ruined. I may take the other reviewers suggestion and use twice as much next time. Kinda disappointed as I bought this for my nephew who is allergic to milk and egg.
3,Huh? What Happened?,"I'm a huge fan of the series, and I was very happy to hear that the Grand Championship dvd was being released (since I missed all those episodes on the WB). Unfortunately, this collection had way TOO much talking instead of dueling (which, I thought was the main purpose of Yu-Gi-Oh!). I was disappointed that the other competing 'world-best' duelists had very little screen-time (we didn't even get to see their duels!) The only good thing about this dvd collection is that it included 14 episodes onto 2 dvds, which is worth the price."
1,Piece of Junk,I bought what I thought was a RETAIL DVD-RW external enclosure but what I got was a BenQ internal drive put in an external encloser that even BenQ wont support ................. Watchout for this guy he's a rippoff artist
1,Very slow and bad support,"I bought it from staples and used it to burn K-media 4*DVD-R. I set the write speed to 4*, but the actual speed is below 1.5. I spent more than one hour to burn one DVD-R. Really slow!! Trying to call their surpport, no body pickup the phone. Sending email but no reply. I am not going to buy their product anymore.Edit: after I used memorex 8*DVD+R, it seems perform better, but the speed is never higher than 4*."
4,Trouble free installation ... works just as expected,Happy with the PNY Laptop DDR2 memory ... I upgraded my 5 years old Dell Inspiron from 1 GB to 2 GB RAM. I can see the expected improvements in the performance of the machine.It took me less than 5 minutes to upgrade the memory and get started with the upgraded configuration.
1,"Didn't work, but at least I got my money back.","I freely admit that my laptop is a bit screwy, but even the IT guys at work couldn't get either of these memory sticks to work in any of the computers they tried them in. But, as I mentioned, it was good to get my money back."
1,Go for other brands,"I bought this one and as mentioned by other reviewer, vista home premium recognized only 3 gb RAM. Then I herad from one of my friend that CORSAIR's VS4GSDSKIT667D2 is optimized for vista. I bought that one (Corsair 2gb*2) and now my laptop's OS (Vista home premium) recognized full 4Gb and is working fine."
1,"Does not work in Macbook 4,1","First set I ordered, neither worked. I returned them and received a replacement set, but only one worked this time. I have read that these work well in other computers, but not mine."
3,Will NOT work for mid '07 iMac (and most other Macs),"This will not work for my mid '07 iMac 2.4GHz, and will not work with many others as well as mac books. Stick with Crucial."
5,As It Should Be,Removed my 2GB RAM that was factory installed into my Inspiron E1505 with MS Vista OS. Swapped out the old for this new memory and the computer recognizes all 4GB of memory. It works as it should. You can't ask for much better than that. Amazon was one of the few places that I could actually find the 4GB available.
4,installed well on my 1720,I bought the item 2 years ago. I had no problems installing them on my dell 1720 replacing the 2x1gb memory. It still works!
2,Bought for white macbook. Did not work.,"Bought in October 2012 for white macbook. installed, screen would not turn on. Return window expired. I would not buy again"
5,Worth the money i spent and more.,"Ok so I have been told for years now that I needed to upgrade my ram. I finally bit the bullet and purchased this here on Amazon.com and it has blown me away. The first thing I noticed was how easy it was to install. I just clicked the old ones out and put in the new ones. Less than a 2 min job. Started back up and my load time was about the same as before but when it came time to load all the start up programs it normally took between 1 and 2 mins and it is now down to about 10 to 20 seconds. THAT BLEW MY MIND. Everything loads quicker and runs smoother. It is worth it just for the start up time on reboots. Just a note I did go from 1gb (2 sticks of 512mb) to 4gb (2 sticks of 2 gb) so it was a big jump but it was worth it. I had no problems on startup, it came right back online. My computer registers all 4gb so I don't know about the other reports but with my Toshiba Satellite A205-S4577 it works flawlessly."
1,1st generation aluminum iMac incompatible when replacing BOTH,"Really wanted to upgrade out first generation aluminum iMac (mid-2007), but wasn't happening. Installed and did not boot up. Fires up for a split second, then not recognized.Some are using just one stick, but not interested in just 3GB, paying for the 4GB, so will use another product. Great customer service with Amazon, really glad I purchased through them for easy returns.Not a computer whiz, so not sure why the issues, but those with more knowledge are free to comment. Thanks."
2,Not Good for a Mac,As many others have mentioned. This memory does not work alone in a Mac at all. Luckily I was able to use half of it in another computer that I have.
1,Incompatible with my MacBook,"Caveat emptor: despite what the description says, this memory DID NOT WORK in my late 2007 2.2 Ghz black MacBook. On the bright side, returning it was a very simple process."
4,does the job but older tech now,Great deal at this price for 4GB. But now DDR3 is on the market there is faster and better ram out there. But again look at the price! Did the job for me.
4,Fantastic,"I ordered the memory on a Wednesday, paid for 2 day shipping, and on Thursday around 5pm....it was at my doorstep! Product was packaged properly, and it installed and ran with no problems at all. Great buy, thanks Amazon."
2,Perfect,"These were a ""snap"" to replace the old memory in my Gateway laptop. I went from 1 to 4 GB, and my computer speed became better than when the computer was brand new. I did have to reset my paging file size to match the new memory size, but other than that, I didn't need to know anything about computers to make this modification to my laptop.I wish I'd done this upgrade 2 years ago!"
3,"Good seller, but issue with RAM","Not the sellers fault! I'll give 100% feed back to the seller! However, the RAM caused issues with my computer, but AMAZON's amazing customer service helped me resolve the issue."
4,Laptop RAM upgrade - YES!,Came in new packaging. Arrived promptly. Installed easily. Worked as advertised. I'm pleased with this purchase.
5,Wow! Incredible! Get It !,"I can't believe how fast my laptop is now that i installed this.I got my laptop in 2005, Its got an intel Centrino processor, and only had 512mb of ram in it.It was so slow, i had to turn it on and go do something else for 30min because i couldnt do anything.Now it is just as fast as my wifes new laptop running AMD premium vision processor, running windows 7.From the moment i push the power button. It only takes 45 seconds to be online and surfing the web !!It is incredible ! from 30min to seconds ! Get it !"
1,Buy Beware,"Just as some other reviewers have stated, this RAM did not work with my macbook. Currently have a white macbook with 2.4 and 2gbs, all that happened when I installed the RAM was a solid black screen.Hopefully others who use this will not experience my dilemma."
1,Would not work with my 2007 iMac.,Would not work with my 2007 iMac. IMac would not start up. I double checked the tech stats and this ram should work.
4,Good! Expensive!,I bought if for my old laptop. Delivery was OK. Quality and performance were good as expected.Price was so expensive for upgrading old equipment.
1,Won't work with my MacBook,"Tried to upgrade my Macbook (late 2007) with this memory but it wouldn't work. The product stated it supported Mac but in the end, I returned the chips back to Amazon."
1,DID NOT WORK WITH MACBOOK (LATE 2008) OR DESKTOP,"I was really looking forward to upgrading the memory on my macbook and matched the specifications for the RAM exactly. I installed the RAM and my macbook would not boot up, I replaced the original RAM and it worked fine. Tried three more time to install, did not work. Tried on my wife's computer would not work. I can only assume the product is defective. I will give them a chance to replace it and try again, if it doesn't work this time, I'm done. I'll bite the bullet and buy from Apple."
1,Does not work correctly with 2008 Macbook Pro,"If you buy this for a 17 inch MBP, you will only be able to use 1 module. Apparently there is some kind of compatibility problem. I haven't figured out how to fix it yet. I guess I'm stuck with it.Problem: The guide that came with my MBP says it can take up to 4GB of ram, so I ordered the 4 GB kit(part no MN4096KD2-667) I cannot get it to boot with both Modules in, but it will run if I just use one mixed with one of the original modules.I emailed PNY and their response was:I have heard of this problem before, but PNY doesn't have a solution. You will have to contact Apple to see if something has to be done on the motherboard to get it to recognize both chips.RegardsGregoryPNY TECHNICAL SUPPORT"
1,Should have read the reviews first,"I bought this thinking it would work for my old Macbook Pro. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of not reading the reviews first. As a result, I found that this RAM only worked when I paired it with my old 1 GB stick (read other reviews to find out why). Returned it for a brand by Crucial, and they WORK!"
2,Didn't work in a Mac,I have an early 08 MacBook and this memory didn't work. Bummer. The laptop turned on but the operating system would never load...
5,hasslefree and affordable,The reviews helped me make a decision. The specs were simple enough to understand which helped in my decision making. The price was comparatively lower than store prices. My laptop performs better. I have a toshiba satelite workhorse. Shiping costs were reasonable. Thank you for making the order easy.
1,NOT 5300 AND NOT FOR MAC,DONT buy for your mac. wont boot. Its not pc2 5300 memory but 6400 memory.Bought a pair and using with one old to work. PNY NEVER more. Misleading company!!!
3,Warning!,"Both sticks of ram put together in 4.1 Macbook will not work, but 1 stick with stock ram will work giving you 3gb of ram."
5,MAC READY!!,"I don't know why there are many bad reviews on this product saying that it wont work for mac but it was so easy to instal on my late 2007 white macbook model 2, 1. For all mac users that say it doesnt work just push it in a little harder and itll work. PLUS the package that the ram is in has the Mac finder logo on it which means its mac compatible."
1,DO NOT BUY,This is packaged as 667MHz but it is intentionally deceptive. It's actually 800MHz and will not run on certain macbooks.
1,i had to throw it away,"it wasn't for a mac,windows only,i had to throw it away,they should really be more informative with their products,bypass this product"
4,PNY 4 gig memory upgrade kit,"My Presario was dogging it when booting up or, running more than 1 application. Checked to make sure the upgrade would work (the correct memory boards) and that the computer would be able to access the 4 gigs. Uprated specs from Compaq advised that it would be able to access 3.3 gig.Followed the instructions to change the chips (2ea 512 Gig boards with the 2ea 2 gig boards) powered up and allowed the machine to boot up. about 3 times faster than prior. Maybe I can't use it all, but what the computer is accessing makes it work faster.Thanks Amazon for the price and the quick serviceDale O.PNY OPTIMA 4GB (2x2GB) Dual Channel Kit DDR2 667 MHz PC2-5300 Notebook / Laptop SODIMM Memory Modules MN4096KD2-667"
1,One of them is broken,"It is very rare that memory is broken, but one of mine is. I am very disappointment and the custom service is bad. It is very difficult to use the so called ""lifetime warranty""."
5,PNY Optima 4GB RAM,Easy to install and get my laptop running with windows 7 64 bit. Found a great deal and went with it! I would recommend PNY to other users because they are a well known company and produce a good product!
1,Not Compatible with My Compaq,"If I could give this RAM no stars, I would. It is not compatible at all with my Compaq, I installed it and it crashed my computer repeatedly. I would definitely go for another brand, but stay away from this one!"
5,Its ram...,"Not a lot goes wrong with RAM. It was packaged okay, and it got to me quickly. Nothing special about it, other than it being the cheapest I could find of this speed ram."
3,1 crapped out on me,"Discovered 1 of the 2 cards was causing serious issues with my laptop. But when first installed, I did notice a significant speed difference from before. Ended up returning the defective one with no issue from Amazon, the best shopping website in the world!"
2,"one works, the other one doesn't.","I just received them, but only one works. I tried three times, using both(doesn't work), using either one(one works, the other doesn't). I believe that not working one should be returned, or both."
1,False advertising,This product is labelled as PC2-5300 DDR2 but is actually PC2-6400. It does not work on my mac as advertised.
1,False Advertisement,"Says it'll work with my macbook, but like many others, I found out this is incorrect. After this many complaints, they should really fix that problem."
4,Horn Mute,"I live in a old house with no sound proof or dampening, so this it the perfect thing to help me practice."
4,"Great info, but dated.","This book was excellent when I first bought it 5-6 years ago. Very well written, very clear and precise. Is it, however, old information for the current times.I was looking for an updated version, but apparently there isn't one."
1,Cheaply Made,"Do not buy this frame if you want your print to look good. It is made of cheap plastic. I ordered 2 and 1 had all the glass broken; the other had edges of the frame broken off. Needless to say, I returned, went to Michaels, and got a nice wood frame for a little less than this cost!"
2,Not very good...,"Falls apart easily, especially the rubber part that is meant to hold the laptop.My laptop has fallen off it more than once.All in all, a big disappointment."
2,Fair Quality - Tiny Molds,The Norpro 6 Piece Cream Horn Case Set is only fair quality at best. They are very tiny and flimsy. I would recommend purchasing larger molds of higher quality.
3,Jr. toothbrush,for a tooth brush made out of recycled material it does the job. good size head that is age appropriate. nothing special.
5,elegant!,"The genius of Mozart is found in his unpretentiousness, which is rather rare among the so-called talented individuals. Maestro Jaap ter Linden doesn't need the expertise of a Bruno Walter or von Karajan to properly interpret these symphonies. His symphonic narrations of these pieces, especially the later symphonies, are not only competent but entirely elegant and-- certainly, joy to my ears! Also, the SACD format is a big plus."
5,right on,"these magnetic frames are exactly what we need to display our 4x6 photographs on the refrigerator without the clutter of different magnets to hold them onto the fridge. i am going to buy more! note that one seller sells a ""six pack"" so you can purchase twelve frames in one purchase."
5,A WONDERFUL GIFT!!!!,"Tell Me the Secrets is absolutely wonderful in that it pulls the reader in to these fascinating stories and gracefully and eloquently discusses God's guidance in each of our daily lives (through some somewhat difficult situations). Children, as well as adults, will visualize and stay captivated by these compelling stories (I read this book over several evenings to my eight year old and four year old and we all thoroughly enjoyed it). I also purchased additional copies and gave this book to my children's teachers as an end-of-year gift. I pray that God's hand remains on Mr. Lucado in his work. Thank you for your time."
5,Highly Recommended!,"I bought this book as a college student (which I still am) and absolutely loved it! I have read the sections on love and greatness to kids of all ages! It is definitely a book that can change your life or at least your perspective on life, if you take it to heart. If you only by one book to read to your kids, this is the one to buy!"
5,Beautiful and full of blessings.,"A lovely book with valuable truths, Tell Me the Secrets is a great family book, especially for children under the age of thirteen. It deals with many of the temptations and puzzles that face all believers, and tells its stories in an interesting, relateable manner. Highly recommended."
2,Unrealistic,"I'm going to keep this short, because most of it has been said in other reviews and I agree with the 2 star and 3 star reviewers. My biggest problem with this book was that there was great conflict between them, but then they would have sex 5 times every night!! And in the closet during a ball! It was just ridiculous. Nobody would walk after so much constant sex and it did not fit with them fighting all the time. She would be angry and hurt and at odds with him, and immediately go have sex with him like they were getting along famously. Just not realistic."
2,Predictable,"Briefly, Kat Martin's The Bride's Necklace is the story of Victoria Temple Whiting and her sister Claire, who are forced to flee from their wicked lecherous unattractive stepfather because he wants to rape Claire. Victoria bops him on the head with a handy bedwarmer, 'liberates' a valuable necklace that belonged to her mother, and, with Claire, heads for London.They end up in the home of lecherous - but handsome - Cord Easton, who hires Victoria as his housekeeper so that he can sleep with Claire.This is definitely a sex-driven novel. Will Cord force Claire? Will Cord seduce Victoria? Will Cord marry the sister he seduces? Will he believe that she's been faithful? Whose baby is it?Do we care?"
2,Shocked!!!,"I am a Kat Martin fan, but this book was a shock. This book had some interesting events, but Martin's abrupt ending to those scenes only made the book worse. The main man was not someone I would consider a hero, because of his mistrust of the main heroine. The main woman was constantly lying, which always made the situation worse... I mean, man she couldn't confide in someone she loved, and that only made him mistrust her more, making her lies annoying. My opinion would be to get this book at a local library, insteading of buying it if it is one that you really want to read."
3,Nice period piece,I liked it. I was impressed about the descriptions of the time period. I wonder how accurate it is. The story line was pretty predictable.
5,A sensitive portrait of the artist,Jill Bossert has captured the essence of this fascinating artist from his immigrant beginnings to his lavish life style at the height of his career. It's a captivating story of a time when illustrators lived the life of celebrity equal to today's most famous movie stars. Bossert's sensitive descriptions of John La Gatta's work shows she's knowledgable about the art of illustration and that she appreciates the fact that La Gatta's work is worthy of acclaim.
4,No JBL but the price is right,"Pros: Ok was surprised at how decent these speakers sounded for the price and the supported audio range. They will do fine for our chuch and my personal needs for now. Had no distortion as long as I kept it blow 125 watts. Be aware that the true power handling is 150 watts RMS. The 300 watt is peak. Amazon got them to me very fast even with the free shipping.The pair I bought have only single color carpet covering not two tone as stated.Cons: you do get what you pay for in way of the cabinet. No pole mount, plastic corner guards, very cheap handles, pulled one lose the first day. So make sure you always pick up with both handles."
4,awesome,i was impressed but im afraid for my dj bussiness i might get so loud anybody else think so? but they look nice and sound nice plus good bass!!!
4,No E.R. visits yet,"This is a decent mask for the price. I play puck and realize that this is not for that, but I figure it could take a few blows. So far so good. I adjusted my chest protector to almost touch my throat, as the throat extension is not that long. Also, the one in the picture has some vents along the chin, but mine doesnt have that."
4,mylec ultra pro II goalie mask,This goalie helment is very compfortable and shap looking. I wear glasses when a play goalie and its very easy to get the goalie helment on and off without messing up my glasses. It fits great around my face not to tight very happy with the peformance.
2,Not a great helmet,"I bought this hoping it would be an upgrade for my deck hockey league. It's not. No chin strap, your chin just rests up against the front bottom of the mask. Also the cage is thin and placement of the wires is horrible. Not the most stable helmet and very minimal padding. Should have gone by the old addage of ""you get what you pay for"". I bought myself a Bauer Ice Hockey goalie mask with Non-Cert Cat Eye opening and I'm very happy with it."
1,"Polite, safe and boring","The impression I get from reading this poetry is that underneath all of the poetic techniques and references to other poets there is very little. It is too safe, mediocre and polite. It is full of things like 'invisible and silent but the deep/ Foundation of ourselves, our cornerstone'. This attempt at quiet profundity doesn't work for me.Nothing is transformed in this poetry. The world would be the same place without it.His poem for the British victims of 9/11 was 3 stanzas and one sentence of musing on death, competently written and with poetic techniques used, but of no probity regarding the event.Likewise his poem against the war, the point of which seemed to be the 'irony' that the region is a place historically associated with civilisation and now is the site of a war. So what? That kind of comment can be found in any newspaper column."
3,Ultimately resolved,Ultimatley resolved but had a short period of anxiety where there were no response from the seller.
3,too long for me,"I am a petite woman, and this dug into my body at the top and bottom. Two mistakes I made - I wore it, for about 2 hours, and I didn't try to return it in under 30 days. I know, my bad.So if you are a petite woman this might not work for you. If you are thinking of of buying this, become familiar with the seller's return policy. They would not let me return it, so I am out $38. It's better than being out $100."
1,Disappointing,"Had the focus remained on the Mayo Clinic experience, this book would have been worthwhile. However, it quickly became evident that the author had been sent through the Mayo physical in search of a magazine article that never took shape. Thus, it became an even weaker storyline for a book then made up of the author's assorted rants to fill the final 2/3 of the book. Interestingly, the author seems to have little respect for the Mayo physical in light of the cost but cost then goes unmentioned when one of his children needs treatment for a serious injury."
1,"Obnoxious, Pretentious, & Rambling","Avoid this author's political soapboxing, circular logic, pop-culture references, and redundant rants. He grasped at straws to fill the final two thirds of the book and it is a painful read. McManus shows us that there's a clear difference between the terms ""Best-Seller"" and ""Best-Writer""."
4,Paul can sing,"Paul Rodgers is an amazing singer, with the sweetest yet powerful voice in rock music. This collection of songs is modernized with new versions. These versions of Bad Company and Feel Like Makin' Love should be played over and over again.The production work is excellent. Geoff Whitehorn is great on guitar as are the other bandmates. For me, the original version of Wishin' Well can never be bettered, though the version here is pretty good.The Hendrix set is great too, particularly Angel.If Paul had put some other less famous songs (I've had enough of Can't Get Enough and All Right Now), it might have been worth 5 stars."
4,Carpet cleaning detergent,"The Hoover ""deep cleansing carpet detergent"" is good for moderate dirty carpeting. However, the Oxy cleaner is great for all around wine and food stains and moderate cleaning. Easy to use with the Hoover Steam Vac All Terrain cleaner."
4,"Hoover 40321128 Deep Cleansing Carpet/Upholstery Detergent, 128-Ounce Hoover 40321128 Deep Cleansing Carpet/Upholstery Detergen","Seems to do a very good job when compared to some others I have tried, but them it could just be my preference. I purchased this item along with a Hoover steam vacuum. Combined together they do an excellent job."
4,My carpets are clean!,"I used the Hoover Deep Cleansing Carpet/Upholstery Detergent in my new Hoover steam cleaner. I had previously rented cleaners from Lowe's and Giant and bought whatever detergent went with the machine. My carpets were always pretty clean after using the rented units, but my new Hoover and this detergent definitely got them cleaner. The spots that had been in the carpet for years even came out. It also got out the pet odor from the two dogs in the house without creating a wet dog smell while the carpet was damp, as the rented unit and detergent had done."
4,Excellent,"Purchased in combo with the Hoover SteamVac Agility, this detergent cleans well, smells good and leaves little to no residue. Also, a great price compared to what you'll find at Walmart and Target."
4,"Dog bile, removal!","Bright yellow bile is the worst stain to get out of a carpet. However, after scrubbing with the smaller hand shampooer, and using this cleaner full strength, it finally came out. Harder than I though it would be, but worth the effort."
4,Works ok but is a little over priced...,the detergent is a little over priced but it did get the job done. I would recommend it for your carpet cleaners.
4,Carpet cleaner,"this is an easy product to use and effective at superficial to buried dirt in your carpet. Also easy to mix up, but be sure to use hot water."
5,Best cleaner ever,This cleaner really cleans. It is the BEST cleaner made. I did not have to use it twice before my carpet looked like new. I love it. Ordered it by the gallon.
3,OK for cleaning rugs,Product cleaned my carpets & furniture ok. I can't compare it to another one since it's the only one i have ever used. I can't wait to see how much dirt comes out the next time I use it.
3,Not the same product,The product works fine but we did not receive the same product as pictured. It was similar but not the same. I really needed it so I didn't return it but it was a bit frustrating ordering something and getting something else. I dont even know if what I got has the same reviews.
4,Pleasantly Pleased,I ordered this product with the Hoover Steam Cleaner. I am very pleased with how well they work together. I have lived in my apartment for four years and never cleaned the carpet. I used this product with the steam cleaner and the carpet looks like it did the day I moved in.
5,Deep Cleaner,Cleans very well. I can see why they recommend it with the Hoover carpet cleaner that I purchsed.
4,Robin wallet,"I bought for my grandson, who him & his are brother are really into Batman & Robin and it is really hard to find Robin stuff. The wallet is your typical tri fold style but the picture is colorful & vibrant. Shipping & handling was a little high but since the wallet was under $2.00 .. I didn't care.. He loved it!"
5,Thanks,My 5 yr old Grandson asked Santa for Teen Titan Toys and told us we did not need to worry about trying to find Teen Titan anymore cause Santa has his Toy Shop. So you was a Life Saver!!!!!!!!!
3,Not for 2002 RSX Type-S,"Amazon says this fits a 2002 Acura RSX Type-S, however it does not fit. The belt is too long and it only has 6-ribs instead of 7.It may fit other vehicles correctly, and it is a very good price.Bando does make belts for Honda/Acura and many other brands, and they are good quality."
5,"Concise, readable and useful","This book was perfect for me. I use GNU/Linux at home and work, and I wanted to learn more about a wide range of topics (bootup, networking, kernel, etc.). For each section, ""How Linux Works"" gives a concise explanation of how things work, and covers a few commands and command-line options.Brian Ward does a great job of choosing what to exclude, to keep the book technically useful but still readable. It's a very efficient way to move from beginner toward intermediate-level understanding.I will use this book as a starting point for experimenting and learning more about GNU/Linux. I can get much more from man pages now that I know more commands, for example.The title is a bit misleading. It covers much more than the Linux kernel, and would more aptly be named ""How GNU/Linux Works."" I also disagree that it's ""what every superuser should know"" - the discussion is aimed at intermediate-level users."
3,Missing important topics,"The book is worth having. Its first couple of chapters are very well written. However I do feel that some important topics should have been included such as RAID configuration, LVM, snapshots, clustering and high availability, /etc/sysconfig configuration, X server configuration. I still recommend this book to all techies involved with Linux."
5,Good way to go from basics to more in depth knowledge.,How Linux works is a good run down of the linux file systems and some key commands. I liked it.
3,Wrong Title,"I was misled by the many glowing reviews into buying this book. This book is n't really about how linux works. Its more like a reference or manual - with very barebones descriptions followed by instruction. It doesn't go into depth at all about the 'how' or the 'why' as the title claims. In fact its just a regurgitation of the standard linux docs and HOWTOs (some of which were written by this author), the only advantage being that here you have them collected here between a spine. But their are websites that do this for you and do it for free to boot. The intermediate and advanced lessons at Linux.org/lessons cover everything in this book and much more in a better organized fashion. I would go there instead of buying this book."
5,excellent addition to your linux library,"With a name like ""How Linux works,"" I was surprised to see how much I enjoyed this book. It filled in many holes in my Linux knowledge. I found myself saying: ""oh yea, I was wondering about that"" several times.Finally, it doesn't hurt that Mr. Ward doesn't come off as impressed by his Linux knowledge. This book feels like an ernest attempt to lay a solid foundation of Linux knowledge for the reader to build upon."
2,Good Book for Beginners new to Linux,"I would recommend this book for someone who is coming from another Operating System, and is not already familiar with doing Systems Administration on another type of UNIX such as Solaris or HP-UX. I find this book to be too rudimentary for someone who is already knowledgeable of doing Systems Administration tasks on another type of UNIX. However, someone who has only used Windows machines or Macintosh machines may gain general knowledge from this book."
3,A but dated at this point,"You should probably look for something more current unless you are doing research. Most of this stuff is valid, but its lacking a lot of the more current features, software and hardware.I have other books that have all of this and more. Look elsewhere at this point."
2,Not bad but not especially useful to me,"As a Linux user, How Linux Works is, I think, a ""nice to have"" technical book but certainly not an essential one.I began using Ubuntu Linux just less than one year ago as my primary operating system. In addition to myriad online resources, I have about nine different Linux books stacked up near my desk.However, only some of those books remain at or near the top of the pile. That is to say that one year later, a few of the books I've bought remain useful but most of them don't.How Linux Works went to the bottom of the pile very quickly after I bought it and has remained there pretty much continuously since then. In fact, I only recently pulled it out of the stack to see if, now that I know a bit more about Linux, there might be anything interesting or useful to me. There wasn't.So my take is that How Linux Works isn't a bad book, but it's one of the demonstrably least useful books I've ever owned..."
4,The Unit,I thoroughly enjoyed The Unit DVD's but had problems with the quality of a few episodes which had garbled speech or skipped frames.The series was riveting and lived up to most of my expectations. I just didn't like the series' final episode.
3,A couple skip,"While watching the DVDs, we found that 2 had some major skipping issues. The disc were straight out of the box and into the DVD player. Not able to watch one complete disc of season 2."
5,Sad it was canceled!!,This is one of the best shows I've watched. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes drama. It is well written and the cast really works well together. My only complaint is that it ended......like most shows worth taking the time to watch do!!
5,The Unit Complete Series,One of the best series to ever hit TV. It is a shame CBS kept moving the time slot. This is one series you do not want to miss!!!!
4,"The Unit, entire series",The unit was one of my favorite shows and was glad to get the series for future revciewing. Will defiinitely look to Amazon for future DVD purchases.
2,Poor quality,"I was thrilled to finally get this series - all four seasons. But the quality of the DVDs - Seasons 3 and 4 - was so horrible that I couldn't watch it. The DVDs stalled, no sound. I returned the set for a refund. Very disappointed."
5,Can't stop watching,"This is one TV show that should have gone into TV immortality. But either they ran out of ideas or their plots became too controversial. Either way, I enjoyed all 4 (3.5) seasons tremendously!"
4,An excelent series,"The story of our military doing what needs to be done when no one else can. It kind of lost it's way when the CIA took up arms against them. As it is true in our or any Government, there are good guys and bad guys. Sometimes the betrayal comes from someone very close to you, sometimes from a complete stranger. It is hard to know who you can count on, but the men of the unit have a bond, they know they can count on each other."
5,Great!!!,I purchased this right before Christmas as a gift to my boyfriend. It came before the expected delivery date. The box set is really nice and the quality and sound of the DVDs are great. I got this for my boyfriend but I love it more than he does!
5,Loved it!,One of the best shows in recent years. I'm so tired of the teenage drivel that dominates TV. This show was interesting and unlike anything else on. The least CBS could have done is allowed one more season to wrap up the story lines. I agree with another reviewer - the head of CBS that cancelled this is an idiot. What are they pushing now - Paula Abdul's dancing show?! Are you kidding me? Does anyone think that viewers from American Idol are missing Paula so much they'll watch this? All four seasons of The Unit are definitely worth buying.
5,One of the best,"This is an excellent series. For those who enjoy action, drama and intrigue, as well as dry humor, this series is fantastic. It will also appeal to those who enjoy military dramas."
4,Review,A couple of the DVDs were scratched but they were a gift to my husband and he did not want to return them .
3,Great Series/Giftset...Waiting for Blue Ray,"I won't bother going into why The Unit is one of the best made military television shows ever, because I'd be preaching to the choir. But I choose to wait until the giftset is ALL BLUE RAY. I see there is one season of BR,which means in time the others will be soon.Fortunately, my blockbuster account will keep me satisfied until then.One question: Does the giftset include the last and final Unit as well?J"
3,Great action and storyline pity about the Fox News political views,"I found the action sequences and the plot to this series extremely good. The sub plots involving the wives were also pretty watchable.As a non American it's hard to stomach the ultra patriotism, xenophobia and arrogance that all the main characters display. At times it seemed as if the storyline was a product of Fox News rather than Fox Entertainment.Overall it's a good watch though. It's just a pity Fox has a habit of cancelling their good shows before they've run their course."
4,Another Good Story,"The fourth installment in Bruce Alexander's murder mystery series about blind 18th-century London magistrate Sir John Fielding is another step up. The plot is built around a Jack the Ripper-style murders of a series of prostitutes. Alexander appears to have read liberally from Patricia Cornwell to Patrick O'Brien, for his stories introduce elements of early forensic criminology and O'Brien's careful historical pictures of English life. The stories are good, they are not great. They are fun and easy reads."
4,A ripping yarn,"With sympathetic characters and crisp dialogue, this tale mixes mystery with shrewd observation and vivid description. For fans of historical mystery, it's a great read that's a welcome addition to an excellent series."
3,"At times quite interesting, but often superficial","This is a story of one of the West's first police forces, London's Bow Street Runners. The force is directed by an (implausibly) blind magistrate, whose personality we never really penetrate. The magistrate investigates the brutal murder of Covent Garden prostitutes. The story skilfully employs contemporary vernacular, and exposes fascinating aspects of 18th Century life in London. But as a murder mystery, I found the book simplistic and one-dimensional."
1,Mystery Cheats and Nauseates Readers,"The Sir John Fielding series hits its nadir with this poorly constructed mystery. A ""solution"" that violates the basic rule of mystery writing, plus excessive and unpleasant gore, will leave most readers feeling cheated--and nauseated. Skip this one."
5,Great buy,"When you pay top dollar for something with the name Bentley on it, you get what you pay for!"
4,Standard Reference for BMW,"Price was good. Product came quickly in good packaging. This is considered the best manual for my car. Some confusion is caused by bouncing between models in the repair descriptions, but if you read carefully the information needed is available."
3,might work if u do your own work on the your car,took a long time to get it...ordered three times and finally had to call customer service - who were very helpful.
3,Bentley BMW 5 series Service Manual,"Manual is generally good and represents value for money but lacks some detailed information in regards to sunroof, a common source of 5 series faults. There also appears to be some discrepancies between the VIN information/explanations and the reality of Australian delivered cars. Novice DIY users will not find this a complete answer to repair concerns but it does seem to cover most of the major points. Details in regard to servicing are good."
5,DREAMRIDER,Purchasing these repair manuals is one of best decisions that I made after buying my 2002 BMW. The cost of the manuals was surprisingly low and the condition was as new. They will help me keep my BMW running great for many years. Thanks Amazon
4,Helpful,"This has been very helpful. It has great pictures and diagrams. We are beginners, so some terms were new to us, but we managed to change our own wiper motor with this book."
2,Does not work for vehicles equipped with Daytime Running Lights,Just installed these on my 2001 Jeep Cherokee that had factory equipped daytime running lights. These lights do not work in that mode. Already chucked my old lights so I guess I'm stuck with these ones.
2,"Slow, ordinary, nothing about it grabs you","I bought this show based on the great reviews I read on Amazon and my fondness for BBC/CBC crime shows. And I gave rave reviews for another Canadian TV cop show I recently bought called ""The Border"". But I didn't like this show much at all. The pacing was slow, the acting no better than a weak cop show you'd see late at night on cable, and the characters and cases just had no 'sizzle' in my view. The premise of this show is identical to the series that ran for 8 years on CBS, also called ""Cold Case"", starring Kethryn Morris. That is a great show but unfortunately not available on DVD and probably never will be. So I would not recommend this show to anyone who loves cop shows. Its not 'terrible', its just that their are SO many good cop series out there (The Wire, The Shield, Law & Order, to name a few)that I wouldn't waste my time watching it. I stopped after 3 episodes."
5,This is THE BEST BOOK EVER!,"""¿Dónde Está Spot?"" is the best book ever! Even though my friends and I are in eighth grade, we think the book is very educational and very fun to read. (And I just love those little flaps that you open!) This is such a good book, and you should read it!"
5,Great for bilingual Toddlers,My 2 yr. old daughter loves this book. She's able to understand the more I read it to her. Its simple and she loves the dog.
2,disappointing,I really looked forward to this book (it was highly recommended) but there is too little information about the really good artists like Venosa and Fuchs. This book seeks to list all the new visionary artists and so has become watered down by including many lesser artists.
4,daughter really is in to anime,Daughter has been buying loads of anime and manga and is very pleased with all of it.
5,Great anime,The artwork is beautiful as always for Suwabe's anime. The plot is interesting with action/drama and humor.
4,Facts regarding questions I had and anecdotes to consider,"This was very readable and offered clear and helpful statements of facts as known by medical literature from a few years ago. The anecdotes from various women helped me imagine what a particular result/situation would be like if I were faced with that, which was a helpful supplement to the statistics. Italso offers many practical tips, which while most of us know/may have read before regarding MS generally (keep cool) it was helpful to have them listed nonetheless. When I am in mother-martyr mode I will try to remember the recommendations to ask for help, accept help, and make time for yourself and to rest...and plan ahead for how to make these things possible. While it would be great if updated, it was still well worth buying and reading. I want to go into pregnancy having thought through as many issues as I can (or at least begun to think about them...), and this book helped me do that regarding having MS."
1,scared me to death!!,"This book has opinions of women who have ms and have had babies and some are very frightening. I wanted to know the facts of being pregnant with ms as well as what happened afterwards, but some of the stories had too much gloom and doom. One thing that I do know about ms is that everyones disease is different and it can change over time. I am one of the lucky ones who has no symptoms and after reading the majority of the book and crying while I read it, my husband asked me to throw it away."
5,"this cd is like todaly rad dude!, whoop whoop","i bought this cd way back, maybe two years ago. mine has a diffrent cover photo, of like swigly lights. Any way, i have allwaysed liked punk, mostly LA hard core punk from the 80`s. although this cd dosent sound anything like that ganra of mucsic the essence is still the same, it has a lot of energy you can todally vibe off of, and its diffrent from anything else i have herd in a long time, a releaf considering i have been listending to music made so many years ago. the music has a harsh metal riff, harsh vocals-comparable to darby crash, and the drums are fast: good stuff. and yes im dislexic!!!"
3,Interpreter's One-Volume Commentary,"This comentary is full of details and facts, but that is countered by its generally liberal/modernist bent, so it ought not be used as a primary research tool, unless that perspective is what is desired."
4,Got The Book,This reference book was received as promised. The seller was correct in his description and I'm happy to add the book to my collection. Domestic use of DHL is a poor choice these days because they no longer serve the U.S. market. Delivery time is lengthened when all domestic packages get routed to Kentucky where they are passed to the USPS. The tracking trail stops and you cross your fingers that your package will be dropped on your doorstep at some point by your postman .
4,Works great,"This thermometer does exactly what it says - works quick and is fairly accurate. The battery seems to last quite a long time, which is nice."
1,VERY UNRELIABLE,"This thermometer can be off 5 degrees.Sometimes it reads 97, sometimes 102.very unstable."
3,"Good, but could be much better.","I am very quick to grab any new book on backcountry camping and travel in the winter, so I had this book as soon as it hit the shelves. I have to say I was not really that impressed with it. Backcountry skis get all of one and a half pages, and traditional snowshoes (wood frame and web) are dismissed as not being modern. Wool gets scant mention, as the auuthor seems to favor synthetics, and native-style mukluks, arguably the warmest winter footwear available, are not even mentioned. This is a good book if your are just getting into winter camping, and want to do so safely, with newer types of gear. There are other books available, which do a better, more balanced job on the same topic."
5,Best of the best.,"I had a pair of copa's for 20 years, they just fell apart, hence this purchase. Now I don't have the heart to wear these, with the special box, and the anniversary status. Got them at a wonderful price, as well. Incredible, really."
1,HORRIBLE,"I have all name brand electronics... all of which were listed in the code number listing for this remote. Panasonic plasma TV, Panasonic audio receiver, Philips DVD Player, and Scientific Atlanta digital cable box. This remote wouldn't operate a single function on ANY of them. Wouldn't even power them on/off. Before you go assuming I just don't know what I'm doing, I've programmed several such remotes, and done extensive work with home, car, and office electronics. I ended up getting a philips remote for much less that controlled all of them with no problem at all."
2,limited support of new hardware,"this remote will work great if your equiptment is older, however be warned that it has limited to no functionality on some newer tvs and components."
3,"Ummm, would help if it had a ""program"" button for VCR","Nice remote for a cheap price, but it didn't work for me. I used all 5 codes for my brand of TV, and although most buttons worked, the ""sleep"" button didn't. That's something I use every night. There is a dedicated Sleep button on this remote, but didn't work for me. None of the 3 codes for my Sharp DVD player worked at all. Power button wouldn't work for my CD player, although it would play fine if CD was manually powered on.But the biggest problem is, there is no Program button on the remote anywhere for VCR mode. How are you supposed to program a VCR to record shows with no button to get into the program screen?"
2,Does not work with Satellite Rcvr/DVR combo!,"I purchased this remote to replace my lost Sony DVD remote control and to consolidate all my remote controls to one. It works with my DVD player and Sharp TV. I thought I could use it for my Direct TV/TIVO satellite receiver/DVR combo. There was no code available for any satellite receiver/DVR combo. I still have to use 2 remote controls. Had I known, I would not have purchased this remote."
2,Not all the buttons work.,"This seemed like a great universal for a great price, but after trying all the listed codes for my TV and cable box, I had to go through the longer procedure to search for codes. Then, the TV/Video button still didn't operate my Hitachi TV. Sony tech support says that there is no way to make it work. If the preset codes don't work, then there are bound to be some of the buttons that aren't going to function."
3,Average Remote,"This remote worked on an older Sylvania TV. I bought mine refurbished so I was a little concerned that it wouldn't work. Not the case. Works fine. Does what it's supposed. Doesn't come with batteries. The setup took 5 seconds, 10 if you count putting in AA batteries."
2,I have a Sony TV...and it sucks!,"My biggest complaint is the twinview button. It will get me into that mode, but there is no button to switch it off!!! I tried turning off the tv to get rid of twinview, nope. I tried going into the menu and looked for a reset function, nope. Maybe if I unplugged it and let it sit for awhile? Luckily I have the original remote, otherwise there doesn't seem to be a way to switch it off the twinview without it.Sony's implementation is terrible. They could have made a twinview on/off toggle button rather than having a dedicated off button on the original remote. This would have save them the cost of needing a dedicated ""off"" button---Actually, it might be a ""regular view"" button---well, they did save the cost of not having it on this remote and screwing those of us that need this button.So,my best option is to get a remote that has a learning/programable feature so that I can waste a button to make a dedicated button to button off the twinview button."
3,Doesn't work with Comcast cable box,"If you are using a Comcast cable box, forget this product. It doesn't work."
2,2 and a half stars at best =worth the 20 bucks,"if you are technically minded, you can handle the hurdles this presents. If you are not technically minded, you will throw this Sony remote against the wall in the first night.I think I got this delivered for $25 bucks and I got what I paid for. It works, sort of. I knew ahead of time my SAT box and my Blu-ray would not get automatic programming. I figured I would just do the teaching of each button route for those two devices. Still this is no denying that its sort of a pain to do the learning process with your old remotes and this sony remote. It will do until I convince myself I should pay more than a 100 bucks for a logitech remote, which I have not yet accomplished. my head still says ANY remote is NOT worth a cnote or better."
4,Great Remote Control,"All in all this is a great remote. Its built solid, designed well, and offers many options for a low price. My only problem with the remote would be the lack of two particular buttons that were on the OEM Sony remote that I lost. There was a button, called ""Picture Mode"" that allowed me to change the picture from Vivid, Standard, Movie, and Pro, very quickly. That is missing from this remote. Not sure why because this button seems common place to most OEM Sony Remotes. The other button this remote is missing is a button that allows me to also quickly adjust a sound speaker setting to Simulated, Surround, Stereo, or Mono.Again, all in all, I can't complain. This is a fantastic remote control for $15. Its worth much more!"
1,It doesn't work!,"Too bad... Unfortunately it does not work with my TV... I could not test the control in another TV, so I still do not know if it is some problem with one or the other..."
4,BRUT Oval Solix Deodorant for Men,"This BRUT scent is great~ My man has to have a deodorant only ~ NO antiperspirant ~ so I am glad there are still some mens deodorants out there. Love the BRUT, and this oval solid is what he prefers (to spray, etc.)."
3,Well written with some fictional composites but reads a lot like a history book,"Much more straight ahead history. great for someone who wants to know about this era but has tons of facts and gets pretty thick. for me it was kind of like historical overload. I absolutely love his other books that read more like novels with interesting characters, some real, some composite, but always following a narural progression thru time from the settling of the colonies to 100 years ago."
1,aims to please everyone but in the end pleases no one,"This is a great concept, and appeared to be perfect for my family, which includes both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. In practice, however, I could hardly find any recipes that were appealing. Lots of convenience-food style cooking and inauthentic ethnic recipes calling for unlikely combinations of ingredients, such as a lo mein recipe made from spaghetti, peanut butter, yoghurt and soy sauce. The meat versions are mostly derived by throwing in a bit of pre-cooked meat to the finished recipe. This is not likely to satisfy anyone, really - and I could have done as much on my own without a recipe."
5,Great variety of recipes!,"There's something for everyone in this book. Realistic recipes with useful non-vegetarian 'add-ins' if you need them. Tried about 6 recipes so far, and will definitely be making more. This will be one of our favorite ""go-to"" cook books for sure!"
4,Review from the Synthesis,"Josh Martinez gives the disclaimer that this album is ""summer music,"" the kind you put in the player, light up the grill and kick back with friends, and he's right. Midriff Music is a mix of mellow beats and fluffy lyrics, each song more upbeat than the last. The album includes the futuristic yet soulful sounding ""One More Sucka,"" the funky old school throwback ""Played Out"" featuring Kunga and ""Tranzar,"" which combines melodic humming with Spanish guitar. But it is the remix to ""Nightmare"" that, if a true look at what is to come from this Canadian born artist, is quite promising. The bottom line: it's summertime, and this is the perfect accent to lazy days of lying in the hammock with a beer in hand.- Katie PattersonSynthesis.net"
3,Hard to rate.,This product may work better for some people than others. I'm one of those people who did not feel any different using it.
5,First Class Piano Trio,"The quality of the playing and the quality of the sound is beyond great!!! Yes, there are no liner notes as Amazon has done a CD-R. The Japan CD of this would cost around $35-$40,and the notes could not be read, unless your from Japan. Bravo to Amazon for making these Venus Cd's at $13.00.The Eddie Higgins CD's are just as GREAT sounding. I now have a total of 6 of The New York Trio and 9 of Eddie Higgins Trio. I also love the Black & White Photos with that 1940's look and style.Jazzman65"
5,Outstanding work!,"This superb work is a scholarly piece, presenting 19th century contemporary accounts, even an article by Mark Twain, supported by a plethora of footnotes, that will make this the definitive work on the Chinese people who lived in the American western frontier during the late 1800s. Professor Dirlik's book is most welcome to this, until recently, little examined topic."
3,Suspenseful,"This book is very suspenseful, and keeps your attention throughout. A quick easy read. Do not like the foul language."
3,It's aight,"The only songs that I really like are song 4. Perpetuate and song 5. land of dreams.... other than that I'll try something different... Keoki's Jealousy cd, Altered Ego-Trip, Clash, and Kill the DJ are all PHAT but this I'm guessing is his oldschool.. i mean, not to say that oldschool is bad heh, and if you really like keoki then go ahead... but if not then get the other cds i mentioned earlier, they are better"
5,Very good for the price,"I got a bunch of these frames for my project after reading the reviews here and counting in the price.They worked just fine for me. These are pretty wide on the sides, meaning when you have them on the wall they don't just lay there flat but stick out a little bit.Please note that they are still a little bigger that 4 by 6"". I had about .5 mm free space on top/bottom and on the side. But since the format itself is small, it's not noticeable when they hang on the wall.This is probably the best you can find for the price.I also was pleasantly surprised to see that the seller shipped them via UPS, not USPS, and they were packed really good."
4,Very good value and fantastic look,I used to buy the L plexi frames for event pictures but now I buy these. They look better and don't cost that much more. A little explaining to the customers is all it takes for setting up the stand. I get lots of good feedback on these so I will keep buying them.
2,Very high shipping cost - beware!!,"I bought one of these without looking at the shipping cost - $7.65, for an item that weighs about an ounce!! Your total price will be $17.64. It's a nice cover, but.... Maybe you should lower that shipping charge, J-life??"
3,CLA Study Guide & Exam,"Cla Study Guide and Mock Examination (Paralegal Series)The tests and questions in this book are a good study and practice guide. However, my exam book came with the wrong answer pages in the back so checking my answers has become extremely difficult."
2,ummmm,Not scary... horrible screaming over and over . About the whole movie was fakey blood and screaming... Did not make it for me.. sorry...
1,Sucks BAAAAAAD!!,"This movie was not low budget, it was NO BUDGET. Filled with a homely cast and poor jokes it was not worth the money or time. Raine Brown is terrible as an actress, not to mention ugly as sin. The movie had gore but so what, the plot was weak, the cast was poor, the camera was shakey and overall this movie was a complete stinker! I was thoroughly disgusted by the price once I discovered how bad it really was. Don't buy it, don't even borrow it."
1,Doesn't work with bi-directional printers,"This print server may be good for simple printers that don't need to talk back to the computer, but it doesn't work at all for those that need a bi-directional interface. That includes most of the HP Deskjet models...."
2,Mac support requires PostScript printer,I bought this server to share a non-PostScript printer (HP 932C) on a mixed PC/Mac network. When connected to the DP-101 the printer always appears to the Macs as a PostScript printer even though it is not. An email exchange with D-Link technical support confirmed that the DP-101 cannot be used to share non-PostScript printers with Macs. To my knowledge this limitation is not mentioned anywhere in the pre-sales documentation.
4,D-Link Print Server (DP-101),"Decent print server. Standard protocols work well and are fairly easy to install and implement. Decent, inexpensive multi-protocol print server. The only downside that I have seen is the lack of documentation on Windows 98, ME, and 2000. These OS's are easy to implement, except I had difficulty making the TCP/IP work.Would I buy another one? Yup."
4,The only server that works with Macs and PCs,"The DP-101 is the only print server I have found that supports Appletalk. When I connected it to my home network, the chooser found the printer immediately. It took quite a bit longer for me to figure out how to configure my PC for TCP/IP printing. (TCP/IP printing was the only way I could configure my PC to print) And of course the price can't be beat.If you have both PCs and Macs, this is the only way to go."
2,You get what you pay for,"I wanted to use the DP-101 to put an HP LaserJet 6MP on a mixed Mac/PC network. Setup was easy enough, but about half the jobs from the Macs just vanish -- they go to the spooler, then go to the printer (at least the printer lights flash), but nothing comes out. This is especially so on multi-page jobs or those with complex PostScript graphics. I emailed D-Link for assistance but got back only an uninformative, boilerplate response. Reading another of the customer reviews, I guess the problem is that the printer can't ""talk back"" to the computer through the spooler.One other problem: this thing wouldn't hook directly to the 6MP. I needed to buy a cable. This is a quirk of the 6MP, which hides the cable connectors in a little bay; it's not specifically a problem with the DP-101. On the plus side, it's tiny, inexpensive, and works perfectly (so far) from the Windows side. Mac users get the short end of the stick again ..."
2,"Ok, but sloooooow","I liked it, the women are beautiful, but it's slooooooow. the free short movie before the main movie suckas. It seems as if the women are trying to add feeling and whatnot to a really lame story. But, that's only my opinion."
1,DOES NOT STAR MISTY MUNDAE,The only reason I had bought this DVD was for the beautiful Misty Mundae...but to my surprise this flick does not star Misty Mundae.If you are a Misty fan I suggest Mummy Raider or even the Lust in the Mummy's Tomb just for the Vibrating Maid featurette (she looks great nude but even better in stockings)
1,WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS FUNNY?,"what the heck does this have in common with carlito's angels. I told my boyfriend to buy me carlito's angels for Christmas and he got me this movie too, he said they came together. Who thought this was anything like that movie, Who thought this was anything like a comedy? who decides these things. ridiculous"
2,Not so good,"The hardware is like all the cheap products from China. The Vista performance test gave my PC an average rating of 3.0 and the lowest score was awarded to the Graphics sub system, so it's not very good."
4,g-force 7300,I bought a new pc with Vista and could not play some simple seek and find games and now I can.
3,good but not great....,"I bought this to replace the 128mb hyper memory I already had....I can tell a big difference in stream video but still a little laggy...the fan does have some noise but not really that bad...it depends on where you store your CPU....So the big problem with this card in Nvidia's control panel...its not real response when you want to be...it runs really slow...my computer has a pentium 4 and 2.5 Gbs of memory....I like the video card but really was expecting a real big difference but not impressed....if your an extreme gamer get the extreme card your searching for...I would buy this card again, I suppose.....let me use it for a while to see how dependable this card really is....use caution when buying video card...make sure your motherboard can handle the 256mb first....does have an option in the control panel to track the temprature of the card...it gives the exact temp of the card and my computer has been on for hours now and the temp stays around 61 degrees...."
4,Just enough,"I bought this card because I was in a particular jam. I had to tailor my video card purchase not to my bank account, but to my power supply. The eVGA card was one of the few decent cards that would work with a 250w power supply, which is what my Dell box has. I know the eVGA box says 300w minimum, but their website says 250w. The card works GREAT for Battlefield 2142, the reason I bought the card. I even have the details cranked up to medium and am now seeing things that I didn't see at the low setting. No lag induced by the eVGA video card and again, if you like Battlefield 2142, this is a GREAT, inexpensive way to get into the game"
2,Fan Noise is Very Loud & High Pitched,"CONS:- Fan noise is very loud & irritating, causing me to return the item to Amazon. (This problem was also noted by a reviewer at NewEgg, who returned the item for a video card with passive heating.)- Did not increase Vista rating for 3D gaming graphics. (I got a Vista rating of 3.0 for 3D graphics, which is the same rating I had before on the same system using the onboard ATI Radeon Xpress 200, which only has 128 MB of shared memory).PROS:- Increased Vista rating for Desktop Aero experience from 2.0 to 2.8."
4,Economical card to upgrade to Vista,I purchased this card simply to be able to use all the features in Vista. I'd never bothered with a video card before because I don't play video games so what came with the computer is usually enough for me. The card was easy to install and I've had no problems with it. If you are a power graphics/video user this probably won't meet your needs but if you're like me and just need a little more video power for Vista this is a good solution.
3,Works great except for the noise,"Worked great from the moment I installed this card to my system and is still running strong. Graphics are great for what the card can support (I'm not running too many graphic-intensive programs) but I've noticed the fan on the GPU is quite loud. I narrowed it down to the GPU cooler fan by keeping my case open and slowing the fan down with my finger. It appears to be a cheap 2"" fan that hangs up at times possibly due to the power regulator on the card (my power supply is 350W with only a few items drawing power). While this is not ideal, it will not cause me to return the card just yet. I do, however, worry about the fan possibly sticking because the noise leads me to believe there is something causing a hang up in the fan's wiring. More to follow as I use the card."
4,"Clever in places, surprising","Some amazing performances in this film and we really don't know what's going on until the last minute, but the senior actors and the children were terrific, the villain chillingly charming.The special effects could be a bit silly looking at times, and the boy we think is the villain gets redeemed. I came to this after Pan's Labyrinth, and liked them both for different reasons.The settings in both were remarkable, but the bleakness and desolation of the desert and mountains and the bomb in the middle of the courtyard was just perfect."
3,A Morbid... Yet Satisfying Picture,"Guillermo del Toro does a fantastic job of placing you in the small chaotic world of an orphanage on the brink of collapse. Carlos (Fernando Tielve), a young boy, is the newest addition to the orphanage. He is the outsider who begins to unravel the mysterious happenings going on behind the walls of the Spanish complex. There is a bit of a ghost story here, but the main plot revolves around Carlos, and how this one boy, affects the fate of everyone at the orphanage. I enjoyed the picture, and the atmosphere that del Toro presents to us. Some of the characters seem a bit wooden, but overall the movie is entertaining, and keeps you glued to the end (even though it was pretty easy to figure out the mystery)."
4,"""Like An Insect Trapped In Amber"" ~ A Spanish Ghost Story","Note: Spanish with English subtitles.`The Devil's Backbone released in '01 is an intelligent, stylish and atmospheric film set in a remote orphanage in 1939 during the Spanish Civil War. The story revolves around a new arrival at the orphanage named Carlos who is assigned the bed of a missing student. When Carlos begins to hear unidentified sighs in the night he becomes determined to discover the whereabouts of the missing child.The film begins with a short, profound narration which caught my attention immediately and got me excited about what was to follow. It didn't quite live up to my expectations. The storyline was a little slow in development and the ending was unoriginal and predictable. On the positive side, the production values are first rate and director Guillermo del Toro creates a wonderful ghostly atmosphere that will keep you watching to the end."
4,Think Cider House Rules...but GOOD!,"This is a truly remarkable film. I won't go into the plot as it has been dissected ad nauseum on this site already, I'm sure. Suffice to say that this movie succeeds on so many levels as to approach brilliance. It is an effectively creepy ghost tale. A coming of age story. A grand soap opera. It is worth the price alone for the smolderingly sexy Edward Noriega as Jacinto, the caretaker with a torpedo-sized chip on his shoulder. As for the young orphan boys, they make the doe-eyed sugary sweet moppets of Cider House Rules look like munchkins on Prozac. They are alive, human, wounded and all-too-believable as boys left orphans by a world they cannot even hope to understand yet. Check it out!"
4,"""An Insect Trapped In Amber""","THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is a well made Spanish language film with adequate English subtitles to tell this ghost/historical/war film to an American audience. The setting of the movie is a remote desert orphanage (totally unrelated to the setting of another Del Toro film titled THE ORPHANAGE) for boys during the Spanish Civil War. The acting is excellent all around with special kudos going to the child actors especially the young men playing Carlos and Jaime. And the film has one of the hunkiest villains ever in Eduardo Noriega II in the role of Jacinto. The movie is filled with atmosphere, gothic images and symbolism some of which are neatly tied in to the plot line and some of which are left dangling. This movie may not be as jump out of your seat scary as Del Toro's ghost story THE ORPHANAGE but overall THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is the better film of the two."
5,Simply Brilliant film,"I have found that, subtitled movies impact you more when you watch them. I have seen many movies, and subtitles usually make a movie for me. When I watched this movie, and read the dialogue/subtitles, I really understood the movie better. I don't know how to explain it, but the film seems much truer with subtitles, foreign films that is. Apart from the subtitles, This movie is absolutely brilliant. I absolutely loved every part of it and didn't want it to end.I highly recommend this movie. But, if you're looking for an extremely gory horror film, look someplace else. This is a movie with a great ghost story, and really just ""creepy"". A must have for everyone! But some people it won't fit to there interests."
5,Hidden in the rough,"Guillermo del Toro is becoming a favorite. This was much better than I expected, more along the lines of Orphanage or Pan's Labyrinth (without the crazy monsters) than his others. Great storyline and setting, definitely check it out."
5,Sleepless,"After watching this amazing film, I found it impossible to sleep. The special effects were simple, and superb. Not only the riveting cinematography, which completely captivated me, and what goes down in my book as the most petrifying ghost ever, but the story - it was moving, and political, and moral, and utterly enthralling. Truly a sublime film."
5,Stylish and thrilling!,"A beautifully told story that far exceeds the Kidman/Cruise film, The Others. Little Carlos arrives to the Santa Lucia School after losing his father during the Spanish Civil War. He stumbles upon a horrible secret of a murdered boy whose spirit haunts it's occupants. Wonderful performances abound; a must see for any movie lover."
4,Bonus Features,"The movie is thoroughly engrossing, unpredictable, and worthwhile, as most of the reviews here attest. But the bonus features on this edition are worth the price of admission as well. Like Kevin Smith and a handful of other active directors, Guillermo del Toro makes an admirable effort to add value to his DVD releases with thoughtful extras for fans and film buffs. Excerpts from the director's notebook, storyboards, even the ubiquitous Making Of documentary all add more substance than the usual PR filler material. Of particular interest here is del Toro's commentary, which goes beyond the usual behind-the-scenes anecdotes to delve into the artistic and historical roots of the creative decisions he made in the film. From the history and conventions of the gothic romance to fine art and architectural influences, del Toro is like an unusually entertaining and articulate college professor with near-encyclopedic knowledge. The extras enhance an already excellent film viewing experience."
5,how to hunt a mammoth,"The devil's backbone is a horror movie like you've never seen before - a good and intelligent one.. It really is not a horror movie, however, but a story which involves ghosts (or the past) and how they fuel our present actions and decisions.. It is a strange and memorable film from spain which will make you think as much as it scares you.. worth seeing.."
5,A damn fine ghost story.,A great film that shows where Guillermo was headed before Pan's Labyrinth. Very atmospheric and beautiful to watch.
4,What is a ghost?,"Life was hard during the Spanish Civil war, especailly for a group of orphans....food is scarce, bombs are dropping on the grounds of the orphanage, and there is a ghost amoung them who keeps saying ""many will die"".Jancinto is the brooding grounds keeper who resents the orphanage and his time spent there. What kind of secrets is he keeping? What is he looking for? Who is the ghost that roams the grounds? What is he trying to communicate to the young men?Visually this movie is stunning. The story is intense and holds your attention. It's definitely worth seeing."
5,Great Director,Guillermo del Toro is a fantastic director who deserves much more praise. People who enjoy beautiful directing and and intriguing plot lines over action sequences will enjoy this movie.
2,a boring ''horror'' movie,"but nice to look at. if i went in expecting a well done period piece drama, i might not have went to see this. i wasnt scared, grossed out, intrigued or interested. i am in the minority as many like their ''horror'' movies dripping with low/non existant body counts and fabulous photography. this ''horror'' movie dragged on and on. while mindless gore is just as bad, there is such a thing as a happy middle.anyway, in case you need one, heres the synopsis as i remember it; back in 1900's theres a boys school or orphanage thats haunted. theres also bad guy/s in search of buried treasure and a ghost. not much action or frights. but if youre a dp in training......!"
2,"one cool looking ghost, but the rest was subpar","Strangers wind up at a run down orphanage with a dark haunted past.The film is in Spanish with subtitles. It is extremely slow moving, but the ghost scenes made up for it, especially the first showing of the little boy. I like the name, but it seemed to have very little to do with the movie. That is, they do explain what the ""devil's backbone"" is (a malformation) but it just didn't seem to fit."
4,A Texan's Luck,"I love the author, Jodi Thomas. Her characters are always rich in personality. It's hard to believe that back in the day, you could just buy a bride, if you wanted one. The tension between the son and his purchased bride his dad bought him was sometimes really frustrating. The author sucks the reader in and has us all wrapped up in the characters as if we were family. The history of the old west and how people lived back then is fascinating. I read every book Jodi Thomas publishes as soon as they are available and I look forward to the next story."
4,the bride lottery,"The Texan's Luck was the third in an interesting series. I wanted to know about the personalities of the men and how the author would develop them. In most romances the men are everything that a woman wants. In these stories we get to ""hear"" the mans side also. I enjoyed the stories...all of them."
3,Not Jodi's Thomas's best....,"No one writes westerns like this author. And this book has the wonderful, stud hero, witty dialogue and all the makings of another great book. Unfortunately, I thought the heroine was a bit too naive and too goody too shoes. Storyline was a bit different and again, the dialogue is adorable and fun.Your call."
5,A note of interest,"Overall, the book is of high quality. All the pictures were well taken. The pieces included were exceptional good pieces from different Chinese Dynasties. It is a book for those who have profound interest in Chinese works of art.Readers should pay special attention to the Ruyao saucer which arouses lots of discussions among professional dealers and serious collectors. It is a very controversial piece which needs to be more thoroughly studied and examined; and compared to the existing samples in different museums and private collections around the world. Without seeing and examining the piece in person, one cannot say for sure if it is a well-sought-after Ru ware or just a later copy."
1,Don't buy this blender!,"I cook a lot, and use blenders often for various tasks: pureeing soups, making dips, making bread crumbs, and so on. I also make mango lassis and smoothies, using frozen fruit, liquids, etc--this blender could not make a smoothie even without ice, the chunks and liquid just stuck in place and nothin' doing. Don't buy it! I'll be returning it tomorrow."
3,Hmmm....,"I decided to pick up Marionette Generation because the artwork was good and the title was interesting- I'm a fan of anime/manga with lifelike marionettes. I admit, this is one of the first manga I have purchased without already knowing a little about it. I sat down to read it and within a few chapters, I was pretty confused. This book is definitely not for the weak of mind! It wasn't *awful* but it was definitely not a series I would continue purchasing. Out of the people I shared this with (all avid anime fans) they too were confused and not excited for another installment. The art is nice, and the characters are cute, but the plot...eh."
3,Better than a portable radio,"Well, i found this product very good for what i need to for. I basicaly use it for when i go for a ride. Although it is 16mb mp3 player, i found it good. This is because i would normally talk my walkman in my back pocket( only just fitted). This was too big and too heavy, and poor sound quality. The d-link 16mb player is light, small, and retains better sound quality. I didn't want to buy a $400 mp3 player for mountain biking, as i could easily damage it. so I went for the d-link, due to being fairly cheap. The only real problem is the 16mb of memory, but like i said it fair outways a walkman or discman...."
4,"Good for the price, for now","Six months ago this product had an awsome price to value raito (I paid 30.00 after the 60.00 mail in rebate), however times are changing. Memory prices are falling, and you can buy a player with 64 MB for 90.00 to 200.00 , and many of these include a radio and USB connection. The point, this is a good product, but I would suggest you consider another, more advanced product."
1,This book is typical Arthur material -- bratty.,"This is typical Arthur. DW is pretty negative about Baby Kate entering the household. At one point she proclaims ""Babies are boring"" Later she commiserates that everything seems to be about the baby and not about her anymore.While kids probably do have these emotions, I don't like the book putting words to them or validating them. Whenever I read this book I change the words to be more positive.Also, it has some nursery rhymes, one of which goes something like ""God bless the moon, God bless me"". Not something that fits my personal style so I have to change this, too, to ""The moon is special and so are you""Overall, I much prefer the ""I'm a Big Brother / Big Sister"" books to Arthur. That being said, my 2 year old liked both books and still asks for them now at 2 1/2 even though the baby is 6 months old."
5,Wendy Bradshaw's the Best!,"I have been waiting for a full length CD by Wendy Bradshaw for a very long time. ""Evening Interlude"" is a collection of wonderful old tunes that showcases her strong and sultry, yet sexy voice. This woman is multi-talented; she writes, sings, produces--you name it. I am a BIG FAN of this woman's music! I only hope there are more releases to come."
2,"Well, guess you get what you pay for","This isn't horrible but it's far from great.....or even good. This product does recharge but the indicator lights do not turn off. If you read the other reviews then you might have noticed this pattern. Since the lights do not turn off be careful not to over charge and get the batteries too hot. Not knowing when the battery is 100% means you just have to play the guessing game. 24 hour charge should do. I recommend forking up the extra two dollars and getting their better model, which I give a good four stars. The lights work and everything. Try to avoid this. You've been warned."
4,Works for me,"Works great for the price,Overnight charging is no problem for me and unlike a couple of reviews I read it fits the electrical outlet fine.I got the 2300 mAH batteries so they last pretty well in my camera"
1,Piece of CRAP,"What a waste of money. left on charge overnight, i thought my house was gonna burn down with the heat generated from this crappy charger.Lights come on but never turn off so its impossible to know when they are at full charge ( if they ever reach full charge).Battery life is woefully low, i used it for my Radio Controlled racing car and got about 3 mins of constant use then, zip ! batterys flat dead. charged them again overnight. woke up, same deal. batterys scorching hot to the touch and 3 or so minutes use in my RC car before dying out completley.This charger now rests comfortably in the bottom of my garbage bin, awaiting for the bin man to come and take it where it belongs, in a land fill.kept the actual batterys that came with it and now charge them in my brand new Duracell charger, works like a charm.very surprised and disapointed with Energizer ??? WTFDuracell Value Charger With 4AA Pre Charged Rechargeable Nimh Batteries, CEF14DX4N"
1,Bad product....,"First time I plugged it in, it wants to fall back out. The LED lights went on and never went off. When I used it the second time, the LED never went on. This is basically a POS."
1,Don't waste your time...,"At the risk of redundancy, given the other reviews...This is a charger which (A) requires you to remove the batteries after a specified time interval and (B) only charges in pairs. This wouldn't have been a disappointment in the late 1990s but, these days, it seems silly for the user or the batteries to suffer needlessly. Why not just purchase a decent charger? I certainly regret purchasing this one..."
1,don't purchase!,"I've had this charger set for about a year, and the only thing I've used it for is my digital camera. I use my camera less than the average person, but I use it even less now that this is my source of power for it. The batteries never held charge for very long (not time for me to take more than about 5 pictures)--I'm assuming that's because as other reviewers have said, the batteries get overcharged with this charger. After maybe one or two uses a month, my batteries don't hold any charge. Worthless product!"
1,Does not work after 3rd usage,It is not working now and i have used it 3 times before this. really bad. now i have to find a support location for this to repair.
1,THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK,"I'm surprised that a major brand like Energizer made such an extremely poor product. You can leave your batteries charging for a whole day, and they still won't be charged completely. I'm very sorry I wasted my money on this, so please don't waste yours!"
5,Energizer Rechargable AA Batteries plus charger,"Arrived very quick and I mean lightning quick. I ordered it one day, got it before 2pm the next day. That's how I like my 2 day shipping. Product was in a very secure package and is exactly what the seller described. I highly recommend getting Amazon Prime."
4,Overnight Nimh Aa/aaa Charger: It's OK,"The light comes on when it's charging, but never goes off, so you never know when it's done. Also, you have to charge 2 or 4 at a time, not one or three. Seems to work OK."
1,Does not stay in outlet,"Do not buy this product. It doesn't stay in the outlet (falls out) and therefore won't charge your batteries. I returned it back to Energizer and they wrote back saying ""thank you for bringing this to our attention"" and they didn't even have to fix anything. They knew that something was wrong with it.I'm sure some of the others from Energizer work, but not this one."
1,MISLEADING LISTING - YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE 2000 mAh batteries,"I purchased these batteries because they were listed as: 2000mAh AA Batteries.In reality, what I received was 1400 mAh batteries. May seem like a minor difference, but I assure you that 2000 mAh will perform longer and better. This listing is not true.I'm calling Amazon right now to request that they send me the batteries that they advertised and that they send them overnight. If they have fool you too, I suggest that you do the same thing."
2,fake title,"the title said With 2 2000mAh AA Batteries, the Product Features said with 2 1700mAh AA batteries, when i received just 2 1400mAh AA batteries."
3,"Honest, Intriguing True Adventure","My only real complaint about this book is that I wish it were longer and had more photos. The style is a combination of the authors' personal diaries they kept while on their month-long voyage down the wild Thelon River in far northern Canada where the open tundra dominates. Their writing was very honest, and I felt intrigued to be reading a firsthand account instead of a recollection that you feel was written and embellished after their trip. At the end of the book, one of the authors describes a portage in great detail and provides a play-by-play of the physical rigors and also the emotional state during this long and arduous portage. This is a wonderful and memorable piece of writing, and I wish that they had given that level of detail to the entire trip. Nonetheless, highly recommended for those who love true adventure stories and who have any interest in a long wilderness canoe trip."
4,This is a Hit!,"I run my own business and purchased this mold so that I would have something edible to put my other products in and sell for Valentine's Day.Everyone adores it!The only drawback I have about this product is that it states it is a ""large"" box. That's just not very true. I believe it does give you the measurements, though. If you map it out to see the dimensions, you won't be surprised when it arrives!I had just a little trouble getting the bottom part of the box out of the mold after the chocolate hardened. Just run the outside of the mold under a little hot water and it pops right out!"
3,Beautiful box cheap mold,"The end product is very beautiful, but with use the inside of the box warps and is difficult to get the end product out. I will say you can use it 2 tops 3 times before it breaks. Also you need an approximately 1 pound of chocolate."
3,Freez A Frame,These magnets have a very thin plasic cover but okay. A bit pricey for the quality and the amount for the cost.
5,Great product.,These are nice. The back is fully magnetic and lays flat on the fridge. They are better than the cheap ones from Walmart that only have two magnetic strips.
5,This book has been very helpful so far,"This book has been very helpful for me so far in practice. There are many different aspects of security in Java from JAAS to J2EE to JCE, etc. He goes through and gives a decent synopsis for all of these areas. This book is good to have for these overviews. If you're going to really dive into an area of Java security, you'll probably need more information but he does a decent job providing the starting point. I found the examples very helpful especially in the JCE sections. The thing I really like is that my project managers seem to be very interested in some newer items like JAAS and JSSE and this book provides information in those areas."
5,Love this,These inexpensive frames were perfect for family pictures hung on the wall. They enhance my pictures and people can't see the cardboard back
4,Front-loading,"It's a nice frame. Nothing fancy, but really good for the price. It is front-loading though (at least the ones I got), so has a bit of a gap in the black frame in the corners. Nothing dramatic though and easy to handle."
5,GREAT WE LOVE IT !,"I purchased 2 one for me and one for my granddaughter she loved it as did I. We are going to be using colored pencils, she has been using them with me since she was 2yr old , she is now 10 yr old and we color together when I have her. I am disabled so coloring is one thing we do together. If your girls any age like faries they will love this book .wendy"
5,Can't go wrong!,"True to form, this is another great book of Cicely's artwork. It's a favorite coloring book of my little girls!"
3,"Cute, but not worth the money","The book is cute enough, but it is extremely detailed. Pretty hard for my 3 year old to color on it. It also was fairly expensive for a cheap, thin coloring book that is printed on the same quality paper as in my printer. I would not purchase again."
3,Could have just bought an AUDIO cassette!,"This video is very ""skinny"" on actual video footage of Malcolm. It's well done as far as the quality of the footage (audio and video), however, you could buy an audio cassette and in some ways get much more for your money. I was hoping for a series of full speeches and interviews but what I got was short clips disbursed between audio played over civil rights movement footage.My suggestion: rent it from the library and decide for yourself whether it's worth buying."
2,"Not for the non ""bodybuilder""","This book is not broken into ""daily"" sections. Each page is dedicated to a specific exercise and you enter the dates for that exercise only. The cardio log is on a separate page entirely. This might be better for power-lifters or the occasional weightlifter but not for fitness fanatics who vary their routine or like to see an entire daily workout on one page. Most women seem to prefer a ""daily"" type of journal entry style workout log. I gave this book to my husband to use who exercises 2-3 times a week and is more interested in his ""strength progress""."
5,Bought it for myself!,"I really think this is a fun album! The songs are well-crafted and display a wide range of musical styles. I like how they teach things that kids need to know (such as hand-washing and exercising)...and also zany things just for fun! These are songs that adults really can enjoy, not just try to tolerate!"
2,"Good music, awfully PC lyrics","The music is as advertised: catchy and flavorful with world beats. The songs, however, are politically correct nutrition propaganda. Some of you might really like them; more likely, some people will think they are good for kids. I think that what is tiresome and tendentious for adults is BAD for kids--but hey, that's just me."
4,Product Works Well,"I have tried many remedies for grazing deer. They have destroyed countless shrubs and flowers. This is the only product that works. I even used a service that comes in and sprays, but in a week they are back. Be certain to use the product twice as often as suggested for those really stubborn &?X%$# (you know who)."
2,deers erat my hostas,deers enjoyed my hostas on the front yard even though i placed double the amount that was supposed to put on them. The product does not work with Iowa deers.
3,Jury is still out on this deterent,"The product was delivered on schedule but I'm not sure if it deters the prairie cottontail rabbits around us. Our property backs up the to an open space (prairie) where an abundant number of bunnies live. Although coyotes, hawks, and owls hunt in that area, the bunnies seem to like our lawn and just about any plant or bush. I have used the granular product we little success and then bought the powdered product thinking I could spray a huge area. Never got to that stage since I was unable to mix the powder with water successfully. It clogged several sprayers. Eventually I mixed the product in a large bucket using a power drill with a mixing bit. Then I just poured it over the plants. Still not sure if it works since I see traces of bunnies."
2,A short term solutions with lots of hassle,"It works till the next rain, or the sprinklers go on or at most about two weeks. I have found the cleanest way to dissolve it is to put some carefully in an empty 2 liters soft drink bottle, add water, and then shake it about. Then let it sit overnight and shake it some more. The problems is that unless you are willing to filter it, it can clog up the little holes in the sprayer nozzle. So using it continuously can be quite frustrating and time consuming. After 2 years, I still have most of my plantskydd remaining. The deer always win!"
3,Plantskyyd deer repellant,"When mixed with water the solution is brown, clogs a sprayer, and leaves brown spots on foliage. The best way to disperse it is by flinging a small broom dipped in it. It does seem to keep the deer away. Spots on stone or other material do not wash away."
1,Simply Overpriced Blood Meal,"I bought it - save your money and go buy some organic blood meal and use it because that is all this is. Blood meal with a tiny bit of vegetable oil, in a powder form.Blood meal runs about 10 bucks for 2-3 pounds. This Plantskydd is charging triple for the same exact product marketed as ""deer repellent"". There is absolutely no difference between this and bloodmeal."
2,UnMixed Blessing,"The product works mostly. Some of my blackberry plants did get nipped after application. However, it is virtually impossible to mix and clogs pump sprayers quickly. The manufacturer gives what it considers easy mixing instructions. they must have mixed something else."
3,A Fairly Pointless Story,"LADY L is a film about an octogenarian aristocrat (Sophia Loren) who reminisces about her steamy life as lover of an anarchist (Paul Newman) and wife of the sophisticated David Niven. The film has a lot of great scenery and a thoroughly competent cast but not much of a story.Loren's husband Carlo Ponti is the producer. Peter Ustibov is the director and screenwriter. The film is based on a novel by Romain Gary. The supporting cast includes Cecil Parker, Claude Dauphin, Philippe Noiret and Michel Piccoli."
5,Little Bean is a winner!,"Little Bean books have charmed the socks off of me and my two-year old daughter who identifies with Bean. Bean does many of the same things my daughter does daily and her Daddy works on the computer and reads her books. The book's pictures are lovely but simple. The story is complicated enough to move my daughter up from the pictures-only books but still keep her interest from cover to cover. Only two wishes: more Little Bean books and, please, show her mom too!"
4,A GOOD LOOK AT THE SPOILED SUPERSTAR,THIS BOOK GIVES YOU A GOOD LOOK AT THE TALENT OF ONE OF THE GREATS IN THE SPORT. MR BONDS IS A VERY UNIQUE TALENT WHO IS A VERY COMPLEX PERSON. HIS HISTORICAL SEASON IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND IT IS DONE WITH GREAT DETAIL AND EFFORT. I SEE MANY SIDES OF BARRY BONDS. THE ONE WHO IS TRYING TO BE MORE FRIENDLY AND AWARE OF OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES HIMSELF AND THE ARROGANT SELF CENTERED PERSON OF YEARS GONE BY. ONE OF THE BEST WRITTEN ABOUT THE HISTORIC SEASON OF THE RECORD SMASHING 73. WELL WORTH READING.
1,Trying to glorify and ego,"I felt the book was pretty laughable and contrived, making much more out of the issue that it warrented. There was no substantive discussion of the very dark side of Bonds at all. It's as if the author just plain ignored all of Barry's detrimental realities and tried to make the reader beleive that it's always someone else's fault when there is a problem. The book would almost be funny if the author didn't actually seem to beleive the drivel he wrote. Trying to make some sort of silk purse out of a jerks ear.Give this one a miss."
5,A Toast to the Baddest Player in the Game,what a Year Barry Bonds had last year&Continues to have this Season?? the Man no matter what folks say or think about Him His Talent&drive are out of this World.Last Year was Magic as far as I'm Concearned.He is my Favorite Baseball Player still a 5-Tool Player.I enjoyed what was stated.Barry Bonds is something else Hopefully One Day He can get a Ring.when it's all said&done there won't be much that Barry hasn't done in His Great Baseball Career.
3,"Great player, a few problems","I purchased this MP3 player cheap. It's a great deal. It has a voice recorder, good quality, large buttons, the EQ adjustment. There are only a few downsides to it.1. The parallel port connection. The downloads are a bit slow - maybe about 15 seconds for a normal song. Plus, you may have your printer hooked up to the parallel port. 2. On my songs, the lengths of the songs show up completely wrong. Some songs are reported to be ""00:00"" long, some are about ""15 minutes long."" But the playback is correct. 3. They need a backlight for the LCD display.Overall, the player is great and cheaper than most. If you're not too picky, go ahead and get it. You won't regret it."
1,Not a very good product,"We've had this player for about a year and it has begun to short out. We really didn't use it that often, the only reason we got this one was it was offered with a rebate which put it (at a good price) at the time. Should have waited and done more research."
3,Mediocre,"I purchased this book only because Nortons book was required for a Machine Elements class I'm taking. I am not particularly fond of the text though because I feel Norton in ineffective at explaining the material, so I would suggest another book if possible."
1,Ahhh,"If it wasn't for my professor this book would have been burned! The end chapter exercises are barely about the chapter they are in and the examples are at least 4 pages long and very hard to follow! Don't use the beam tables in the back either, just look them up online!"
2,not well organized,As a student trying to learn the art of machine design I found that this book was rather unorganized and it wasn't until I had read it and studied the pages time and time again that the principals really became clear.
4,"Excellent procedure, theory and examples.","The book has excellent procedure and theory development and explanation. The end of the chapter problems need extreme help. The questions are redundant, unclear, and are built upon from answers of previous chapter problems, sometimes requiring answering a question from chapters 2, 4, 5, and 6 to get a final answer in a chapter 7 question. Many answers in the back of the book are incorrect, about (50%). Looks like Norton had his TA do his problems."
2,The book you love to hate.,"First off, a little background. I'm a 3'd year technology student, this book was the forces (*cough *cough), assigned material for one of my classes.About the book. It covers many important topics related to the mechanical engineering field. As such it is a pretty handy source of reference, and can be used to quicky refresh one's memory in a particular subject.The writing style of this book however, is very poor. It is boring, hard to follow and the examples provided are repetitive and do not explain a lot of things. I once voiced my complaint about the book to our professor, to which i got the following response. ""Well, this book was written for the university level"". If following a university level book is supposed to take more effort than understanding the actual subject matter, then i guess Mr Norton has done his job!"
3,It's OK.,"The product came on time.It does not have all information I expected, but it has enough for a start."
3,"Good steering wheel, Bad ride-on.","This toy has a great detachable steering wheel, it is fun and has provided many hours of entertainment for my 2 kids. We keep it in the car so the kids can ""drive"" too. The ride-on part of this toy is total joke. Although it has wheels, they don't turn at all, and the base of the toy is so wide that it is hard for little ones to push along. The base would be okay if you are looking for a stationary toy, but I found it misleading that it had wheels and we were disappointed that it doesn't actually work as a ride-on. We ended up throwing the base away and keeping the only part we liked -the steering wheel."
3,"Great toy, not very safe for younger children though","I bought this for my sister's daughter who is 8+ months old. As soon as we installed the toy for her, we realized right away that there should be a higher back support with the side support. Otherwise the child can fall. She can sit properly but can't walk right now. So, we are scared that she can topple. I would have rated this item 5 stars if it had the back and side support to make it safer for the younger kids. I doubt that this toy can be safely used for the children under the age for 1+ years without the fear of them falling from the toy."
4,Fun!!!!,My 1 1/2 year old loves this toy. We always went to a friend's house and he always played with it until I finally got it for him. He loves it!! It is fun. It has 3 kind of music options and each option gives you several songs. Its lights and music are a lot of fun for little kids!! It is very sturdy. Highly recommmend it.
5,a baby/toddlerhit,"Got this when baby was only 6 months old. He played with the steering wheel part on the floor. IT kept him occupied for at least a half an hour or more. When he started to pull up, he then used the scooter part as a prop to start walking. He just reversed the wheels and used it as a push cart. Though not its intended use, he learned to walk with this toy. He would walk up and down the hall all day long! Now that he is an experienced walker, the steering wheel is attached to the scooter and he can sit on it and play with the dash. However, the wheels do not turn smoothly, and he does not use it as a ride on. He still pushes it around as a cart. When he has friends over, he will give them rides. Endless entertainment and educational value."
2,Broken after a month,"My baby played with the part that makes noise and has buttons for about a month (he was to little for the sitting part still) and it no longer works. We tried changing batteries but no such luck. It just beeps while the batteries are in it. It was fun (for him, I was miserable) while it lasted but it didn't last long enough to pay $50 for it. Luckily it was a gift or I would really be upset."
2,Good collector's item but a bad game,"I received this game as a present since it is known I am a fan of both the original movie and the graphic novel.As other reviewers have stated, the rules are confusing despite being contained on a single sheaf of paper (both sides).First, the good:The box is high quality and durable as are the game board, the pieces and the cards.It is easy to put everything back and no struggles with returning the pieces/cards to their respective spots.Now the bad:The rules don't make any sense. On one hand, they are written from the point of view that you'll be playing competitively with anyone else willing to play. However, they are also arranged so that you have to play cooperatively to ""defeat"" Top Dollar and end the game. No where in the rules does it create a need to compete, though. After two hours of playing we finally called it a day and the game has gone back in the box. If you do get this and want to play I would recommend some ""house rules"" to liven it up a bit."
3,Monroe Absorber,"After reading some of the reviews and knowing Monroe is a reputable company, I decided to buy the shocks for my 2007 Dodge Durango. For one the Durango is not a light vehicle, but these were considered replacements for the originals. They seem to do okay, fairly stiff, not totally uncomfortable. Not disappointed, but not overly enthused as well."
4,Too Short Overview of a Long Career,"This two-CD set only contains one real Battlefield Band CD - which contains one number for each of the 19 albums recorded by the Battlefield Band during their 25 year career - not including their latest, Time and Tide. (The other CD contains an overview of traditional Scottish recordings by Temple Records, including various current and past members of Battlefield Band). So this is way too short to cover their output. Still, everyone who likes the group will have favorites on this CD. Although there are differences depending on the particular lineup of the group at the time, it is still surprising that the group could manage such consistent quality throughout all their changes."
5,Great retrospective of one of Scotland's most enduring traditional music groups,"For those who know Battlefield Band, this is a wonderful compilationof some of their best music. For those who do not know the band, thisis a fabulous introduction, not only to Battlefield Band themselvesbut to Scottish traditional and traditional-style music. BattlefieldBand were pioneers in the use of the great highland bagpipe inensemble play and this compilation showcases the great pipers thathave played with the band over the years."
1,What a bunch of FREAKS.,"Traditional Irish folk music gets spazmolagized again.I long for the days of the 1970's and 80's when De Dannan, Planxty, The Bothy Band, The Furey Brothers (aka The Buskers), Boys of the Lough, Wolfe Tones, Davy Arthur, Danny Doyle, Tommy Makem and The Clancy Brothers, The Dubliners, etc. blessed the world with the most beautiful of traditional Irish folk music in its purest form.Anyone loony enough to have the unmitigated gall to refer to this pile of bandicoot barf and epileptic caterwauling as Irish music - much less even liking it - would have to be a freaking retard with an IQ of somewhere below -74 with a bib around their neck to catch the drool."
2,"OK, if you're not thinking pancake","Yes, these are gluten-free and allergen-free. So based on that, I tried to give them grace. They taste ok, but they don't feel like pancakes in your mouth and they don't cook like pancakes. If you look for the bubbles, you'll have hockey pucks. They work better, once cooked, like slices of bread. My sons liked jelly on them and I liked apple butter. My oldest even made a pbj. We'll finish them up, but won't buy them again."
1,This book is totally useless,"I had to buy this book for a class on Teaching for Academic Literacy. The class, like the book, was a waste of time and money. Basically, the book consists of modules, and each module is designed to teach you how to conduct a particular activity with your students, such as how to teach your students to classify things. Then each module ends with a rubric for assessing your understanding, and pages of space to allow you to reflect on your enjoyment of classifying. So basically, you only have to read the first couple of pages of any module. So go to the library, check out the book and read those pages, and don't waste your money."
5,The Last Hero,"This book is quite simply amazing. From the first page you are hooked and become an invisible member of the crew hacking your own way through the Ituri Forest. Stanley is brought to life along with many other real-life people, including Tipoo Tib, the slave dealer. Read this book and you will never forget it, the whole atmosphere of unexplored Africa and its hidden tribes will be with you always. The unknown beauty of the Congo River and its people take you into a new world with different standards, different morales and a very different slant on life. The actions of Emin Pasha will move you to tears and the whole experience of this book is one that every person should enjoy."
1,black august,this album was a big dissapointment compared to his first albumheavy mental he talks about women this women that whichis lame rap music is dead and it will never rise to greatness ever again because its not raw anymore and everyone wants tobe a player is this is what rap music has become music based soley on women sex and violence?
4,Natural Horsemanship Explained: From Heart to Hands,"I bought this book because of my long standing interest in natural horsemanship and because of the credibility of the author. The book is a follow up to Miller's previous book ""The Revolution in Horsemanship: And What It Means to Mankind"". In the current book Miller explains why the natural horsemanship techniques work and raises some interesting questions when there isn't a explanation for why something does work. Best of all besides providing a wealth of useful and interesting information, this book is an enjoyable read."
2,You Can Do So Much Better,"Spend a little more money and buy Equitation Science by Paul McGreevy. McGreevy is a vet and his book has top quality science based information with none of the Natural Horsemanship BS that this book contains. You can read Equitation Science and learn more important information about horses than if you read this book and all the other books on horses ever written along with watching all the DVDs marketed by Parelli, Anderson, and all ilk. Do you and your horses a favor and read McGreevy's books."
1,"Get off it, Doc!","The forward is more of a sermonette than an introduction to horsemanship. Imprinting, Pat Parelli, Doctor MIller should know better. If I want to ride my horse at a full gallup into the back of a moving horse trailer then Parelli is the man. Anyone, including the good doctor, who espouses his (Parelli's) techniques is more interested in selling books than making people and horses team and partner members. If you want to be safe and have your horse regard you as a companion and a ""predator"" that can be trusted, I suggest you attend a Clinton Anderson Tour and gudge for yourself. The notion of having a 1200 pound animal be ""your buddy"" is ludicrous...about the same as having your child who looks to his or her parents for direcition and safety as ""buddies"" is."
2,Frame arrived slightly broken!,"The plastic on the one of the corners was cracked when it arrived. :( However, I'm not framing anything super expensive-- they are just accent pieces for my college dorm wall, so as a college student with limited options, I'll take the risk! If you're looking for something sturdy or giftable, this would not be it."
3,One Arrived Damaged,"These frames are okay. I knew they were inexpensive, but I was hoping that wouldn't mean they would arrive already damaged. I ordered four 5x7 frames, and while three of them are fine, one is broken. Part of the frame edge had snapped right off in transit. Yes, three of the four items were intact, but the one broken frame left me feeling disappointed overall. Trying to decide if it's worth it to send back and exchange, or if we should just hang as is and hope no one notices...."
2,Bad packaging/broken parts,"I ordered 10 of these frames for our remembrance table at our wedding. 3 of them came already broken in pieces inside the packaging, and 2 of them broke into pieces as I pulled them out of the plastic. Very unhappy with this purchase and will not be purchasing again."
2,"Good Frame, but broken","I received the frame wrapped around with at least two layers of bubble wrap. Upon cutting it open, one of the edges was cracked. I was going to give this as a gift, but I can't give something that is broken. Doesn't cost enough to return it. I wonder how something so protected could be broken. Should have just bought a frame from the store, probably cheaper there also."
2,Lousy quality control - look closely at the glass,"We ordered a ton of these in various sizes to frame prints for sale. When I inspected the glass before putting in the pictures, I started finding scratches and dirty glass. I think we returned around 3/4 of them because we couldn't resell them with the defects. Also had a lot of chipped corners on the 5x7s, along with warped sides. Several of the 8.5x11s had fingerprints on them.They're easy to load, and mostly the glass stays in place, but they do look as cheap as they actual are. Just realize that you're getting what you pay for. If you won't have people looking closely at them, they're probably fine, but I wouldn't use these for any serious application - I won't even order any to display snapshots at home. The quality is too hit-or-miss."
4,What Happened To Karen?,I liked Frosty The Snowman and I liked this sequel which is much better than that horrible Frosty Returns but I noticed in this that Frosty has a reunion with some children who are very happy to see him but what happened to Karen who said Frosty was her best friend? They should have had the Karen character in this but besides that I did like the cartoon. If they ever make another Frosty cartoon I hope they include Karen even if they make her an adult with childern of her own.
5,Love it!,"Just like i remember when i was little. I had forgotten how short it was (about 20minutes) but my daughter absolutely loves it and it's the perfect amount of time to do a ""quick movie"" before bed. We purchased a used one and it was in great condition!"
2,Long hair? Don't bother.,"I should have listened to the review about not buying if your dog has long hair. I followed all the instructions, going from the longest comb to the smallest. It just kept getting stuck - had to keep taking the combs off and on. Finally, ended up grooming her with a scissors. All in all, not a good experience for me."
2,Old software--beware of the Netscape 4.72 issue,The software works--as long a you ensure that you use the cd's 4.72 netscape browser. It was only through much correspondence with a helpful tech person that I was able to work the software issues. Let me clarify this. The browser is what you use view the contents of the CD: OFFLINE. It has nothing to do with logging on to the Internet. The Taber CD doesn't seem to work with the IE browser that comes with it (version 5.0). Later versions of Netscape DO NOT WORK. This has something to do with the java plug-ins. Eventually they'll have to come up with a new CD for medical students that need this. Backwards compatibility eventually will not be possible. Too bad for the problems--obviously the Taber regular dictionary is a standard medical reference tool. The digital pronunciation software that goes with it--is helpful for knotty words--for both native and non-native speakers. Kudos for that.
1,why make bad movies???????,can any movie be worst than this.......... there where so many mistake. I thought that a movie mad out of such an amazing book. I can only say I was thoroughly disappointed!!!! :(
4,Smooth Jam!!,"This CD reminds me of my days in thr San Francisco Bay area as I drove down US 101 to the San Mateo Bridge. The vocals by Helen Rogers are excellent, especially on ""Blue Days"" and ""Body Heat"". But it's the tunes ""Lost Summer"" and Northern Lights"" that will have you moving. Though its repetative in it's musical rifs, it's still a very good listen!! Recommended!!"
5,GREAT MUSIC,I have been looking for music like this forever. Thank you Paul Hardcastle. Goes to show you that it's never to late to find not only great love songs but............GREAT LOVE MUSIC!!!
4,More impeccable musicianship,"The instrumentalist/producer behind '19' and 'Rainforest' came up with a winner in this 1993 set, released originally on the JVC label. The songs are well-polished adult dance music, easily amenable to fans of the 'smooth jazz' format.What separates this piece from the 'muzak jazz' pack are the clean production of Paul Hardcastle (who also shines on keys), the lilting, almost Lisa Lisa-like voice of Helen Rogers, and the soulful sax playing of Gary Barnacle (Level 42, Phil Collins etc).Highlights on this collection are 'Northern Lights' and 'Really Miss Your Love.'"
3,DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN,"If you have seen on Seagal film, you have basically seen them all. Steven Seagal, a student of the Arnold Schwarzenegger school of bad acting, plays a typical Steven Seagal in a picture with no plot twists and nothing to make us think. Early in film Seagal is double crossed by his partner (cop) who shoots Seagal. Forced into medical retirement he takes a job guarding the beautiful daughter of a wealthy business man and former police buddy.Bad guys want to kidnap said daughter. They succeed and Seagal goes ""walking tall"" to go get her back. No plot twists. Nothing unexpected. Just a plain action flick of one ""superhero"" ex-cop beating up the bad guys. The movie was in serious need of a writer, not only for plot, but a few clever lines.F-bombs, silicon nudity"
4,Great Seagal Movie,"Oh Yes , The Keeper is another great Steven Seagal action movie . Steven is gettin meaner and meaner . He rocks !!!"
2,Not Enough Action,"The Keeper, starring Steven Seagal, plays an ex-cop named Rolland, who goes to Texas to protect his friend's daughter. I have been a huge fan of Seagal and like his movies, but I was looking for more action. Obviously a retread of Man on Fire, I found the movie boring at times. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a horrible movie, like Mercenary for Justice, but it definitely isn't my cup of tea. If one thing is good about this movie, it's that he does his own fight scenes, but these entertaining fight scenes are so far and between I can't recommend this movie."
3,Not bad. Could have been better.,"Seagal plays Roland Sallinger, an ex-cop who's hired by his friend, Texas millionaire Conner Wells, who needs a bodyguard for his daughter Nikita after someone's tried to kidnap her.You never know what to expect from Seagal's direct-to-DVD movies. They've ranged from almost unwatchable to entertaining. The Keeper is not too bad. It has a coherent story and some good action, but it starts out slow and spends a bit too much time on dialogue trying to add depth to the characters. In the second half of the movie, it gets better and in the end it's a decent action movie, better than many recent Seagal movies, but could have been even better."
3,"more seagal,more weight",i always liked the early seagal movies in the 80's.but it's been downhill ever since.i didn't care too much for this movie at all.not his worse by any means but not that great.
4,Guilty Pleasures,"Really good Steven Seagal movie. I like them all. Maybe It's because I did some research into what the man has been about. His accomplishments as a human being 'blew me away' (ha ha). I like 'good' movies too. But sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch some good old fasioned macho alpha-male kick-ass fake violence. God knows, there's enough real violence in the world to run away from once in a while. And I pretty much know exactly what I'm getting and how it's going to end and who's gonna win! Bottom line - I don't know why I like him and I don't question it. I don't like all action stars or action movies, or action genres - zombie flicks and tons of blood don't do much for me. I don't review those movies 'cause I don't watch them. I don't understand why anyone would take the time to dis a Steven Seagal flick because they don't like him. If you don't like his stuff, why are you watching it? Duh."
4,Steven Seagal is getting back..,"I'm a big huge fan of Steven Seagal. I mean I had all his movies (maybe I have some that He does not have in his own collection). The plot in this movie is that some bad guys kidnapped a friend's daughter on his watch and now he needs to get her back. I enjoyed the movie at least is better than a few from the last movies he got out on DVD. This is not an masterpiece as Out for Justice or Above the Law ( ""Have you seen Nico?"") but is very enjoyable for any Steven Seagal fan. If you saw Man on Fire from Denzel Washington you may like this one. (But The Keeper is not as good as Man on Fire)."
3,this is preety good but.........,"I like how this product diminshied all my wrinkles, lines, and my uneven skin tone but it did NOTHING to firm my skin and it was too greasy. I put this moisturizer before I sleep and when I woke up in the morning , there's oil and shine ALL OVER my face. I was competeley grossed out and was quite dissapointed. Not recommened for people with oily skin."
3,A little heavier than what I need.,"I bought this because I thought I needed a heavier night cream, but its a little too heavy for my face as I have oily/combination skin. If you are dry/combination or dry and need that extra moisture, this would be an excellent product for you. I use it on my neck only and it works wonders for that, but when I use it on my face, I have a few whiteheads in the morning. Still a good product as most of the Olay line has proven to be."
5,Good Overall Night Cream,"Being 50, I want to take extra good care of my skin and face. I'm a fan of Olay products and have been for many years. Unfortunately, the highly-rated Regenerist line gave me a headache due to whatever fragrance or chemicals used. (I'm not saying Regenerist isn't a great product, just that I couldn't use it.) Based on other reviews, I tried this one. Happily, it does not cause any sensitivity or irritation and I've been using it for over a month. A little goes a long way. This size will probably last you almost two months. It has a great consistency and leaves my skin feeling really soft and well-moisturized. It's nice to be able to use it on both my face and neck and I am starting to see overall improvement in tone and firmness."
5,Wonderful smell....,"First of all I am in my early 20's so I haven't much experience in night creams. I just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after I decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness. I use ""moisture therapy cream"" by Olay in the morning before I put on my makeup, and then I use this at night. My skin always feels so soft, more soft than I think it ever did. I can't give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability, but I can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier. The scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to.I would recommend this product to anyone of any age. It has a good price compared to everything else on the market and I believe it is best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting until the signs of aging have already begun. Prevention is key!"
4,love the product...,I've been using Olay products for over 40 years and am very pleased with the results. I'd recommend it to anyone.
1,Have to say it's done nothing for me,Has not helped in any shape or form. I am currently also using Product 7 that does work. Tried using this along with it and it has done nothing. Doesn't work other than to get my face and neck soft.
1,Overwhelming cloying scent. YUK.,"I applied Olay Total Effects one time. I thought the scent was strong, but hoped that it would dissipate in a few minutes. Wrong. I had to wash my face and hands - twice - to get rid of the stink. And I do mean stink - overwhelming fake floral yukkiness. Like perfume that costs $1.99 for 16 oz. at Walmart.If artificial fragrances bother you, give this one a pass."
4,Night Magic,"I needed something to help firm my face and neck, so I use this every night and it's really working. Olay has always been a good product."
4,Have used this for a while,I've used Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for some time now and really like the way it makes my face feel as well as the price. I've tried various creams and this one I feel I can notice a difference.
2,Moisturizes well but didn't make my skin firmer,"I have been using the product for 4 months and have been applying it to my face every night before bed.PROS: Has a nice clean smell, moisturizes very well, makes my skin feel smooth, gets rid of dry spots. Also, a little goes a long way. I still have 1/3 of the product left after 4 months.CONS: Did not tighten/firm my skin whatsover. Did not prevent or smooth out any wrinkles as I noticed new wrinkles over time, and the smile wrinkles I have got worse and are more noticeable now. Lastly, this product made my skin look and feel VERY OILY. I don't like wearing the product around other people as the shininess is embarrassing.This cream is basically good as a moisturizer if you have dry skin, but isn't really good for anything else. I can't say I'd recommend it, but looking at how other people have rated this, there is still a good chance that it could work well for you."
5,Its like silk on my face!!!,This night cream is amazingly smooth. My face feels moisturized but not oily. It smells so good and I can honestly say that I have seen the wrinkles on my forehead smooth out. I love it!!!
3,Nice Cream,"This is a nice, light night cream. It has a pleasant fragrance, that is barely noticable and fades quickly. I like the way the cream feels when I apply it, like my skin is saying ""aahhh"". The cream soaks in quickly and is not oily or sticky at all.I can not give it a higher rating because I did not find it to be effective at firming. In fact it did not leave my skin as hydrated as other products I have used. I will finish my jar, but will not repurchase.I am nearly 60 years old with fairly dry skin and I must need a need a more emollient product. I think this one would work well for younger people."
3,Good moisturizer,I used to like this cream because it is a good moisturizer. I liked how my face felt after I put it on. But I can not attest to its firming capabilities.
3,No detectable difference,"I have used product for 6 weeks. The box that it is packaged in is at least two times the size of the small jar that's inside. I am in my early forties and have crows feet on the sides of my eyes and furrow lines across my forehead. I also have brown spots. This product has not reduced my wrinkles and has not diminished the brown spots, so it does not do what I was hoping it would."
2,Made me break out,"I'm in my mid 30's and I bought this for use only on my neck and jawline. I have combination skin, my neck isn't usually oily but this product made me break out. I gave it two stars instead of one because it works great on my hands! Obviously it's expensive for a hand cream but I didn't have to throw it in the trash because it didn't work the way I was hoping. If you have combination/oily skin try to get a sample of it first just to make sure it doesn't make you break out."
3,No complaints..works well,"Works well...my skin is usually rough from the day when I put the cream on at night. Overnight, my skin heals. It's great. The only annoying part is that it doesn't really ""soak"" into my skin. When I shower in the morning, I feel the cream sticky on my face. No big deal though..still a good product"
4,Pretty good,"I have very dry, sensitive skin, which is prone to break outs. Since I have been using this I have seen a reduction in break outs and a more healthy, pinkish glow to my face. I have ever been complemented on my skin looking better. It is not a miracle or anything but it is pretty darn nice for the money. I would say that this is better then Clinque's counterpart. I will probably reorder this when I use it all. A little goes a long way. I have read that people with different skin types don't have as much sucess with this so be sure to read the other reviews before you purchase."
1,Olay total Effects Anti-aging Night Firming Treatment,I don't like the way it dries into my skin and I have to really scrub in the morning to get it off.
1,Didn't like the smell,"I did not like the scent of this product. However, the thickness and texture of the cream is great. I don't think its a magical cream that will firm up your skin, but it moisturizes."
3,Good moisturising cream,"I have chosen becouse it was recomanded by my friend.I am satisfied, It is good but not perfect.Yes i would recomend the product if you cannot afford expencive one."
3,There are better products out there!,Bought this product based on the reviews by other shoppers. Can't say that I have been overwhelmed by the results. Product sinks in without any noticeable difference in the look of my skin. I don't expect miracles but do expect to notice some difference over a period of weeks.
4,Good but not Fantastic,"I bought from the 3 types of Olay total Effect, and I did try them after reading the instruction, There is no magical effect apeard after 1 month but there is diffrence, The company was very good in logistic maters"
3,Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream Purchase with HBC Depot,"Product ordered was the product delivered. This is product I use on a regular basis on my face, so I received what I wanted and needed, therefore my rating is on the service provided by HBC Depot, which was simply ""Ok"". There was nothing extraordinary or special required of HBC Depot other than simply taking product from their shelf, packaging it and mailing it. HBC Depot is not the manuafacturer of the product, just simply a supplier of the product. The ""Olay Total Effects"" product line I am extremely pleased with."
4,good night cream.,"I have good skin. Not acne prone, but i still have some acne scars, and discoloration. when i use this, it makes my face very soft, but at times it stings. (I guess i have sensitive skin)I haven't seen an improvement, but it moisturizes real well."
4,Great price!,Love it! I shopped around for weeks and found this inexpensive and most effective! Great for my sensitive skin too!
5,Night Firming Cream,I really like this night cream. My skin is dry and it hydrates it very nicely. I prefer Oil of Olay products. I have been using them for years
3,Not sure if I like this or not,"I received this product with no box and the jar was taped closed. I thought I was buying a brand new item, not used. The cream left my face greasy in the morning. My face turned red and itchy. It just was not what I expected."
1,john cena's underground,it is always on back order because it hasn't come out yet the release date is jan.25 that is not the real star because i havnt heard it
1,Folks...,"This album debuted on the Billboard charts at a pretty mediocre #15 and by week 2 plunged 35 freakin' spots to #50. The only reason this album even made it onto the top 100 chart in the first place was because of the ""name"" John Cena. Had this EXACT same album been put out by a newcomer to the music scene, I am willing to bet you it wouldn't have even sold 1 unit. How a record company even had the NERVE to put out this POS is beyond me..."
1,"0 Stars!!! Whack,Whack Album!!!",Go back to the OC where you belong and leave hip hop to Eminem and Paul Wall!!!!!!!He thinks he's a Bad Bad Man.More like Gay Gay Man to me!I don't care if you think I'm hatin' on this Wigger!!!!I can see you and your gay/white self!
1,lmfao....,"I cant believe some of you people are sayin this is real hip hop, this is one of the best albums out this year, praisin this guy about how good of a rapper he is. This guy is a joke. A little kid could spit better than this dude. A little kid could drop more knowledge and better lyrics than this dude. Haha yall are trippin if you think this is any good. Hes got nsync beats and backstreet boy beats haha. This is pathetic and a disgrace to hip hop. When do queers like this think they can rap? Is actin a fool and wrestling not enough for this dude? Do you have to drop a pathetic album disgracin hip hop? i think them steriods got to this dude, i mean hes makin rap albums, actin black. The only reason this album would sell is cuz this dude gets the publicity from the WWE which millions of people watch. Yo this album is trash... seriously, this guy needs to stick to grappling with men and stop rappin and actin black."
4,A pleasent surprise,I've never been much of a wrestling fan but my friend recommended this album so I checked it out. I didn't have high expectations but this was a pretty good album. John Cena is most certainly talented as a rapper and I hope he makes another album. He's not as good as Eminem and Lil Wyte but he's one of the better white rappers in the game. He's also a lot better than that dreadful Paul Wall. Pick this up if your a rap fan or a wrestling fan.
1,Pathetic Even for rap....,"John Cena sucks in every sence of the word. Now this lame, laughable excuse of a wrestler has an even worse more laughable album.....Cena is one of these people you want to punch in the face every time he open's his square mouth. So john we all wish we ""couldn't see you"" or hear you for that matter. Total garbage, don't insult yourself by listening to this tripe."
4,Great for Wrestlemaniacs,"Came quickly and my son plays it all the time. It's loud,has good rythum and he likes the lyrics. If you like hip hop and rap and Wrestling...This is for you! Not anymore R rated than Wrestlemania."
3,John Cena's CD,"The John Cena The Debut Album was Pushed back to May 10, 2005 for all who like to know when it comes out!! Well this CD I have its ok but it needs to be more then a single I give it a 3!!"
2,Nice rap.......NOT!!!!!,"Look, John Cena is a great wrestler. He needs to stay being a wrestler and quit trying to be someone he's not. I know too many people that would probably shoot him for the things he say. I mean, the rap ""Bad Bad man"" is ok. But I don't think he writes any of his raps. He needs to quit trying to be black and just be himself.I give the album 2 stars. But I'll be praying that he doesn't get hurt. SERIOUSLY, NO RACISM IS INVOLVED!!!!"
1,omg no,the only thing he is a bad man at is rapping i have this mate can bust the tune bad man good and fast john cena a no hope wannabe this album dont by you aint gangsta john cena
1,wack ass want to be rapper,"John Cena, please keep your daytime job,theres no more space for white rappers, and if their were,u wouldn't make.You're the lamest of them all,I'm a better mc and I'm a white guy."
1,WTF?!?!?,"THIS IS NOT MUSIC!!! It's just a bunch of wwe wrestlers' theme musik.THis sux, it's as fake as wrestling is. He has nothing to say, nothing to rap about."
5,cant mess wit this,1st of peeps who hatin on cena r jus fools like my freinds who obviously hav no taste in music like most peeps on ere i recommend this 2 ne hip hop fan
4,Better then T.V.,I love the WWE and have heard Cena rap on the pay-per-view's and t.v. I thought he was good at just putting one liners together. So when I heard he had a cd coming out I thought it would be just that. But I think he surprised a lot of people with his skills. What he does on t.v. ain't s**t to what he can do. One thing that is hurting him now is this is just what he does on the side. Once he puts out a couple more albums and gets a little better with his beats. The main stream won't be able to ignore him.
4,Good alternative,My son is 9 and really likes John Cena. I was so glad AMAZON had the clean verstion. It is difficult to find in stores. Its very appropriate for the younger fans.
5,u cant c him,"hes a wrestler and can rap.im suprised that it wouldnt be like shaq and be a piece of garbage but i was wrong.the best songs r1. chain gang is the click2.if it all ended tomorrow3.bad,bad man4.right now5.the time is nowthats just my opinion.go cop this album"
4,Much better than I expected,"Very impressed. Like the Fozzy album I expected this to be horrible. How can you take a gimmick album seriously. I'm not a Cena fan by any means.That said, I broke down and gave the album a listen this week. Steller use of hip hop to portray a message. ""The Time Is Now"" & ""Bad Bad Man"" are very fun energetic tracks that flow better than some of Dre or Snoops work.By far, the best song here is called ""Right Now"". It's one of the lighter R&B tracks on his album... One of those songs that just plain makes you feel good about who you are. A song with a deep message about being happy where you are and happy with who you've become. If you have a chance to see the music video for this song give it a look.Give this CD a chance... I opened my mind. You should too... You'll thank yourself for it."
5,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"What an album, great, with the exceptin of a lot of swearing this was very enjoyable.my fave track was make it loud, dunno if it was live, but it was a great track and remmeorable"
5,"a good album, the tradeamarc is awesome","i originaly thought that this cd would be pretty lame, because of the rhymes john cena had on smackdown and during wrestling, i never seemed to find them that good. but as a hip-hop/rap fan i must say i like this album a lot. john cena did pretty good throughout the whole album, but i would say the real star of this was trademarc. every verse trademarc spits is awesome, he is a great lyricist and i hope he become a platinum rapper."
5,THIS CD IS SO AWESOME.,THIS CD IS SO AWESOME. I JUST LOVE IT. I THINK JOHN CENA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRESTLERS. HE'S JUST SO AWESOME. AND I DON'T LIKE JBL. I Think He Is Such A P****. And I Hope John Cena Kick's His A** On Judgement Day This Sunday. So I Think This Cd Is So Awesome. And It's A Must Have For Any John Cena Fan.
5,Cena 's got Skillzzzzzzzzzzzz !!!!!!!!!!!!,"First off I want to give mad props to Cena and TradeMarc...the album is dope! I have been listening to hip hop for what seems like forever (I am 30 years old) The cd reminds me of a mix between the original LL Cool J and some Will Smith. This is OLD SCHOOL hip-hop...just flowin with thoughts. Nothing about gangs,violence....just the love of the game. Some tracks worthy of mentioning is:Make it Loud, Right Now (ladies track, hits the sensitive nerve, Just another day, Don't wanna f**k with us and What Would You Do. I stress this is not another athlete like Shaq trying to make it. Cena has pure talent...it is just an added perk seeing his fine ass in the ring every Thursday night. If you are a true hip-hop fan you MUST buy this cd...you will love it...!"
5,First wrestler with a rap CD,"At first I thought it was joke seeing John Cena making a cd but when I heard this ablum I love every song, one of them is his wrestling theme music when he walk down the wrestling ramp on RAW."
1,Its a Baaad Album Bad Bad Album,"To be honest this is a waste of a CD, John Cena!!!!! What are you thinking. he has no talent in the ring, so what in the blue hell made him think he could release an album. This album is so lame it cant be described John Cena must have co written this with a 2 year old cos he hasnt got that much intellegence! if you want to show your friends a talentess jabroni who cant wrestle and rap to save their life Cena is your man.Cena has already runied the wrestling business now he is ruining music. this album is worse than anything Mr Blobby came up with this album makes bob the builder seem like a lyrical genius this album is that BAD. cena is a Bad Bad man.John Cena You Cant See me ?? If only......."
3,punchlines dont make classic albums,"u ppl are dummys for saying this albums a classic. dood is a punchline rapper, nothing but one-liners. plus, every other line is a metaphor which shows his skills are limited. hes like a whiteboy jadakiss, good mixtapes, but cant hold an album. he dont have street cred, but hes got credibility tho. he worked with folks like 7L eso and i think hes down with hiero. most folks wont know those names but they big in the underground scene. not mike jones undeground, but that soft core, all lyrics underground, and that scene is nothing but whiteboys so ppl need to stop getting all shocked like him and eminem are the only whiteboy rappers. he just happened to be a famous wrestler so he brought that scene to the mainstream. -- dummys"
1,WAIT!!!,"Check John Cena's official site john-cena.com, in the forums, because the webmaster Erin gets news from John HIMSELF, and said that the album isn't released yet, and it's supposed to come out around November/December. THIS CD IS NOT OFFICIAL, IT IS EITHER FAKE/BOOTLEGGED WHICH MAKES IT ILLEGAL."
5,This is the sh*t,the album is dope on all factors ... if you like ne type of rap or hip hop you will definately wanna go out and get this...one of the best albums of the year this cd is definately a hit and not a miss it does stand out from others so go out and cop this (...) right now
1,you call this Hip Hop?,"I've benn listening to hip hop for about 10 yearsThe first time I heard this John Cena guy rapI was shocked. This guy is the worst rapper everMy ten year old brother likes him. This john Cena guy is fakeLook kids if you really want to hear some real hip hop listen tobinary star, visionaries, emanon, SOUL POSITION, RJD2 heiruspecs,no thats hip hop with heart. Everytime I hear something like this it hurts. Look I Luv Hip Hop, and is not just musicits the culture (emcees djs b-boy and graf artists)Evetime my brother would play it i would take the cd out and play underground.I know hes a kid but if hes gonna listen to Hip Hop it better be underground ....peace"
3,Decent,"I don't like Cena but I do not agree that this is the worst rap album out there. People are just not open minded enough to accept him as a rapper. Just like people were hating on Allen Iverson before the album was even released.Though I'm not saying he should quit his dayjob, Cena isn't that bad. He's better than half the platinum level rappers out right now."
3,Not Bad For A First Try,"I looked forward to hearing John Cena's first rap album. I was seriously hoping he wasn't going to turn into another Marky-Mark...you know, someone who will use hip hop for his own expense, then drop it and move on.Let's hope he comes out with a second album! It's pretty good for a first try. It has a great underground feel, and Cena has a good flow. PERFECT for someone like him--for if he would've came out with some sort of flash, top 40 music...I'm sure I would've threw it right in the trash...and a lot of peeps on the site would be breakin' on him. And he was SMART to keep wrestling out of his raps as well. I would've NEVER bought it if he was rappin' about beating Ric Flair's behind!His cuzz Trademarc keeps it tight...and Bumpy Knucles does his job with the hooks.Overall, a good CD. Keep at it Cena, keep it REAL most of all...and your hip hop will definitely get tighter!"
3,"Great Wrestler, Average Rapper...","I got John Cena's CD from a friend to listen to, and while I was skeptical, he did still give you an impression that he is in fact a rapper. Not like that M.O.M. or K-Kwik, John Cena does have skill; However, he's a standard rapper. Nothing impressive, he has a few decent punches, but from what I've seen of him on TV, he's said better lines on Smackdown then on the album. His buddy Trademarc is only good for a few tracks, but not impressive in the least overall. Bumpy Knuckles is a lame early 90's rap gimmick name, and he wasn't exactly impressive other then his verse on ""Flow Easy"" (I believe), which otherwise was a throw-away track.This is a decent CD, it isn't quite Vanilla Ice, and there's no ""Just Lose It"" tracks on here, but the lyrics on most of the album are average with a few good punches."
4,Very impressed,"I'm a true hip hop fan, I like Nas, a the way through Murs and Jean Grae. If you are a true hip hop fan you would have known that John Cena was on the MURS song called Hustler. This CD is good but not great, John Cena has some skills but tries a little hard on his punch lines, but overall this cd is very impressive through the lyrics and the production. He probably wouldn't sell to the NON-Wrestling fan though. But if you do not like wrestling you should pick this up and really listen to it."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was pleasantly suprised by this CD. I watch Raw and Smackdown and I have heard him rap but it doesn't compare to what is on this CD. Also tha Trademarc has a nice flow as well. The CD has an old school feel to it. I pretty much like the whole CD but if I had to choose one song it would be ""Right Now"". I would recommed this CD. So go ahead and get it."
5,STUPID HATERS!!,I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE HATING THIS WWE CHAMPION/RAPPER.I THINK HE IS REALLY TALENTED FOR A WHITE RAPPER.PEOPLE DON'T HATE THIS GUY BECAUSE WHITE RAPPER CAN RAP AND THIS GUY IS BETTER THAN EMINEM.JOHN CENA DESERVES A ROOKIE OF THE YEAR BEACAUSE HE CAN SPIT RHYMES AND KICK YO ASS IN THA RING!! SO GET THIS AMAZING ALBUM NO COMMENTS.YOU CAN'T SEE ME MOTHER FUCKER
1,why cant i get Zero stars,this sucks this is the kind of crap that is distroying hiphop right now any real fans of the art of hip hop will agree that is the worst hiphop album created this year and maybe even within the last 10 years just stick to wrestling and he's not even good at that!
1,sigh...,Alright i can see why 9 year olds like this. I mean nowadays they are the ones going around with bandanas and all that. But if you are above the age of 14 i doubt you will like this. These tracks just suck. almost all the people who bought it did only because john cena is the world champion in WWE (for some reason).i think- Just like his ring work. This CD is terrible.
4,Good reading,I got it for my b/friend who is military. He enjoyed reading this book as well as others by this author. One comment from him - it is a hard reading if you are not familiar with Russian politics and history of those times.
1,It would be nice if I could get this item.,I don't know why it's so hard to buy Wise potato chips. You can't get them at their own website and you now can't get them thru Amazon. What's up with that?
3,Worked great for awhile,"This item worked great for me for a month and then all of a sudden, it started smoking and burned the motor. I had been using it for 30 minutes in short, not to demanding weeds. I'll keeo my gas one, thanks............"
4,Weeds hate this product!,"Weeds watch out! This is a simple, yet effective, tool that easily spools additional thread. The unit is fairly light and is assembled in just minutes. No need to spend more."
2,arrived broken,"arrived broken (even had 3 small stones in box!) box looked like it had been run over by a sherman tank. had been shipped airbourne ground and delivered to my po box by usps. taped it togther with duct tape in 3 places, and it works. seems like a good product, but watch amazon's shipping. with the wierd shipping, I didnt even know where to go to file a claim!"
4,A NEW VOICE IN ROCK AND BLUES.,"I found this CD to be a great collection of songs. Alvarez' guitar playing is in the same vein as Stevie Ray Vaughn and Johnny Winter. His compositions range from the bouncy and lyrical ""Working at the Mint"" and ""The Balder I Go"" to solid blues-rockers like ""Long Way From Heaven"" and ""My Life"".My favorite has to be ""Sometimes I'm Down,"" which begins delicately and ends all too soon with a high energy burst that has me reaching for the replay button.CHECK IT OUT!"
2,"The sad thing is, this had a lot of potential...","There were some very good ideas here, and I suppose that theoretically the other (later and better!) books should have been written to be more consistent with this one, but...Ditto on what the previous reviewers said about inconsistencies, and another one I noticed - Regis is described as fairly short in World Wreckers, while in Heritage he's 5'10"" at 15 (and presumably expected to grow some more).The romance between David and Keral was written well enough and with enough sensitivity to keep this from being a one-star review, but damn, I wish this had been rewritten as The Bloody Sun was...."
1,Can I give it zero stars?,"""The World Wreckers"" is awful. Plain and simple. Now, I'm a die-hard Marion Zimmer Bradley fan, so this is not an easy thing to say. Take my word for it -- this is a BAD BOOK.Why? The plot is inane. Basically, some evil scum developers come to the invented planet of Darkover with the intention of exploiting its people and antural resources. The aristocracy of the planet jumps into action, and the author seems to forget their previous indifference to the well-being of the peons.Why else? The characters are better described as caricatures -- always seen by the reader as stereotypes and extremes. The writing itself is confusing, unstructured, and full of grammatical errors. The book lacks originality, and reads like every other science fiction pulp ever written. Even if you love the Darkover series, skip this one."
1,Another nonsensical thing,"Ditto what the previous reviewer said, I've got another thing that was wrong - the fact that in this book it was stated that all Comyn with laran were red haired and grey eyed when she previously described Dyan Ardais (who no one would doubt his telepathic power) as dark haired. Also, she made Danilo (among other things) red haired in this book, and in Heritage, he was dark haired. =] Just some additions to the previous reviewer's list!"
4,A GOOD DVD/VCR COMBO,"I had the Zenith XVB613 Combo and like it very much. At about 16 months a VCR Tape wouldn't eject. I called Customer Service and though the unit was out of Warranty, for a small fee, they sent me a New Unit. A more updated version with improvements. I mailed the old unit back, postage paid. In a week or so my tape was returned. I can't say enough about Zeniths'GOOD Customer Service,they were both curteous and prompt. The Zenith XVB813 has worked flawless since,along with my LCD TV and my Surround System.I like Zenith."
1,Review of used Zenith XBV613 DVD/VCR,"I bought this used DVD/VCR on line through Amazon. When I received it and tried it out, I found that when I played a VCR tape back the picture bounced around and sometimes the horizontal went out of sync. I returned the DVD/VCR for a prompt full refund."
4,Very very good read,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down,. The characters were welll defined and the storyline kept me really interested that I had to finish the book in one reading.I highly recommend this murder mystery and look forward to more of her books.. It really is a thriller and had my heart racingA lot of the time."
3,good but not macaframa,it was a good movie. it was way to short 27 minutes really come on guys you could have stetched it out a bit longer. but i did like it just not long enough for me as soon as it started it was over.
5,Works very well,"Mac setup flawless under 10.4.9 Tiger. Never could get windows driver to work until I assigned a static IP address to the printer. Run it off a D-Link DI-524 router.I'm a home user. Printer is fast enough for me and print quality is good. Printer seems to have 3 operating modes, namely 1)printing, 2)sitting ready in case you print again, and 3)standby. It's somewhat loud during printing, but not unreasonably so. There is fan noise when in mode 2 as decribed above, and it's completely silent in mode 3. It does dim the lights on startup (in my old mid-century home) so there's some current draw when the heater(?) starts up.Have had no paper path issues. Tray holds a generous amount of paper - we've not had to refill in a month (and that's during tax time...)Have not tried any of the fancy stuff. After fighting with my old HP 1610 for over a year, the reliability of this machine has been most pleasant."
5,Super saver choice!!,It's selling about $150 + tax in OfficeMax. I bought that in Amazone for under $90(tax included) with free shipping half year ago. I use it for print my handout and homework. I've printed more that 500 pages and I'm still using the 1st toner. The network feature is really work with my linksys router and very easy to setup. Great thing for student.
3,Driving me crazy at the moment,"Like all of you, I was up and running within minutes and found it to be quite the capable little printer. However, I have Windows XP and am finding MAJOR problems printing from Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0. Every time I try to print more than one page at a time from an Acrobat document (and I use many of them), the printer freezes up and I get error messages. Upon looking online for an answer, the troubleshooting is very primitive and I've already done everything it's suggested (with no improvement). VERY frustrating - I'm already regretting this purchase. I have the HL-1435 on a different computer in my home and it's been chugging along for years - I expected the same from this one - I hope that technical support can help me tomorrow (it's too late to call them now)."
1,Constant Paper Jams,"It is an appealing printer as it is priced less than $90, but it is not worth the money if you plan on printing out documents. The constant paper jams and paper curling make this printer unusable. I purchased a Dell Laser Printer 1700 for my office that works well and is under $200. I do not recommend this printer and believe it is worth a little extra money for another option."
5,Brother HL-2070N Network Monochrome Laser Printer,"Product was new, though the box appeared old and beat-up. Did not look like that happened during the shipping process."
1,Paper Curl Nightmare,I was skeptical of some of the reviews where people complained of paper curling but this printer does in fact severely curl paper. It is so bad that it is unusable if you intend to use it for business presentations or legal documents. The exception is if you own a good iron and have the time to press your documents before turning them in
4,"Fast, Easy, and a snap to network","I needed to upgrade my 4-yr old laser printer to something that was smaller, faster, and, most importantly, easy to network. Settled on the 2070N (even though the non-network model was selling for about $80 after rebate). Unpacked it, installed the driver (important hint: don't plug in the usb cable until *after* you install the software!) and it was off to the races. Speed is impressive: from off to ready to print: 10 seconds. 12 page web document (text) printed in about 20 seconds. Plugged it into my Linksys wireless hub, ran the software on my wireless-enabled laptop, and the software detected the network first time, installed the driver, and now the laptop can print from anywhere in the house. That easy. Only downside is some paper curling in the output tray, but easy to remedy by pressing the paper flat on a cooler surface. I'm quite happy with the printer, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a compact, easy to use, networkable medium-duty device."
4,Prints really fast but too noisy and paper curls,"I purchased this laser printer on amazon a few days ago and so I far I like it except it produces alot of noise when it starts printing, gets warm fast and produce paper curls. Aside from that, its a very good laser printer for the price, prints really fast compared to a regular inkjet printer and also will save you alot of $$ on replacement ink."
3,Speedy Inconvenience,"It prints beautifully and quickly. Noise level is a little high, though. I do a lot of duplex printing and the curl, insignificant for simplex work, is a nuisance. I have to stop to uncurl the paper for reliable second-side printing.The manual feed slot doesn't help align the paper. Diagonal feeds are too easy to get. So are failures to feed causing a paper error that needs to be cleared.The small radius turn of the paper path makes a mess of envelopes."
5,So Far Thumbs Up!,I've owned it two weeks and feel it was a good purchase. Now we will see about its longevity...
4,Excellent Printer,"Easy to install, right price and excellent print quality. Goes to sleep when not being used. My last printer had to be turned off manually. Not great with envelopes. Looks great."
4,Simple Network Printer (Windows and Mac),"Small form factor and compatibility with Windows and Mac are HUGE features. My wife has a Mac, and I have an Windows XP PC, they both had an easy time with this printer. The web interface is basic, but it gets the job done. Quiet and fast too!"
4,Great for the price,"I have had the printer for about 6 months and have had no problems so far. It prints fast and clean. It does exactly what I need for the right price.It does curl pages, but it's hardly noticeable. It also jams about once every 500pages (grabs two sheets of paper at a time). Both are minior flaws that are easy to fix. For the price this can't be beat!"
3,Nice but the network modules failed after three years.,"This laser printer is actually a workhouse. I work from home, and need to print out lots of documents every day. With OEM Or genuine cartridge, it can always meet my expectation. Resolution is good, speed is great. And, it does not so picky to paper type.Two major issues I have are:1. After the paper entering this printer, the output paper seems be heated like a scroll. That make it hard to collect all print-out in the output tray. That does not matter what brand of paper I use.2. The network module failed after three years. Now I can only connect it by USB. service fee can buy me another new machine. so bad.--"
3,Can crash - turn off and on to reboot,"Printer works fine for me -printing things. My only complaint is every few months print jobs don't do through, and I have to turn the printer off and on again. Then it will print my jobs. There aren't any firmware updates from what tech support told me. Using it with Mac OS 10.4.11"
4,Excellent basic networking laser printer,"This is a very simple machine to use. The only difficulty I had with it was setting up the network because it doesn't have an lcd with which you can program it. Otherwise, it prints quickly, it's not very loud, it doesn't take forever starting up, and you can load larger size sheets into it due to its expandable tray."
4,My first laser printer,"For my first black and white laser printer works very well. Gives good quality printed jobs. Fast when printing several pages. Paper is curled at ends when exits the printer,but set down for few minutes and paper flattens out. Very good product for the price."
1,Don't bother. This printer is fragile.,"I made the unfortunate mistake of buying two of these printers. Each lasted about year, just long enough to be out of warranty. Then, one failed (with the paper light constantly on) after we replaced the toner cartridge. After following all the possible solutions from Brother for that problem, we bought a new drum unit, the part that holds the toner cartridge. That cost $85 and didn't fix the problem. Then the second printer failed in the same way. I've had other laser printers (HP and NEC) that lasted for years and years. I'll never buy another Brother."
4,Ease to Install,Great printer at best price. Install fron CD was lots easier than stated on paperwork. Double side feed not that good. Better to insert 1st copy back in tray.
4,Great printer!!!,"I have a HP Photosmart 2710 wireless printer and it has been a world of problems -- especially the insane software that severly slows Windows systems. So, I was skeptical. But WOW! This printer was a breeze to set up and works very well. It slipped into my network without issue -- it almost seemed too easy. I would give it 5 stars, but it does cause your paper to curl. So, it is a good printer for most uses, but I wouldn't use it for business purposes where presentation is an issue."
5,"Excellent, affordable printer","I have had this printer for about a month now and have been extremely pleased. As other reviewers have mentioned, the pages due tend to come out a bit curled; however, the curled pages haven't bothered me too much since I use the printer for small home/home office jobs.The quality is excellent for a very reasonably priced laser printer. It is quiet, warms up quickly and prints very quickly compared to my old Lexmark ink jet.I highly recommend this printer for home/home office jobs and as a replacement for an ink jet printer (where you constantly have to replace ink cartridges!)."
4,Wicked,"Very fast printer, virtually no upkeep necessary. I've printed off more than 1,000 pages and I have had to problems at all. I'll be buying a new toner cartridge in about 1,500 pages so I'll have a backup. It is a bit noisy, for an office it would be fine, but for printing off homework in the middle of the night in your parent's room, you would get yelled at. Shut the door to your room, and no one will care about the noise (except you). Also, it looks cool for a printer. I use the network feature and it works superbly, very easy setup with XP/Vista."
5,Excellent bang for buck!,"I got tired of my ink jet cartridges drying up and becoming unusable, so I decided to go the laser printer route. The print quality of the HL-2070N is very good, as is the print speed. If you don't need color printing, this is the way to go."
1,Don't buy this printer!,My old ink jet was better than this printer. There are ghost images on the pages and envelopes always print crooked. I needed a printer and the one I wanted was on back order. I now wish that I had waited for the one with great reviews!
3,Disappointing,I gave up my beloved HP Laserjet 4L when I switched to Vista (that's another story). The good news is this printer is network ready and is fast. Bad news is you have to pay the devil to get it to print envelopes easily and with a lot of curl. Print density could be better.
3,"not bad, not great, but not bad","Ok, I read reviews here, then went out and bought, so i figured I would give back...I bought this because of the cheap price, good looks, lack of a ""stick out"" paper tray, and the network connectivity. I read the paper curling problem, and figured it wouldnt bother me, but its a pretty big thing. it must produce allot of heat, because not only does it curl the paper, but it also fuzes envelopes shut, and completley melts the window in the window envelopes.I not going to take this thing back, it does have great qualities, like - you can use a browser to modify the network settings (like a dsl router), it looks great, the printing speed is very nice, and the fuser is a nice 60 bucks, oh, and the fit and finnish are much nicer than any of the hp1000 series I have worked with, and being a network adminstrator, i have worked with a bunch, its just the curling, melting, and sealing of envelopes."
4,brother HL2070N,I looked for a home laser printer to co-exist with my hp ink jet. The brother HL2070 had more ram than an HP 1022 I was considering and was lower priced. The toner / drum cartridges are also lower cost. When the printer arrived I noticed the quality of assembly was better than the HP 1022 I saw in the local stores. The driver set up was extremely easy. The print speed is quick. Small or full sized text is extremely good. I really like the multiple operating system support. I run Mac OSX and some Mac OS 9 software.
1,"Terrible - constant paper jams after only 6mos. Noisy, curls paper etc.","I do not recommend this printer!Wasn't thrilled with it at first because it was a noisy. I can't use it for printing envelopes because it they come out sealed and if the envelope has a plastic window, the plastic is warped. I tried printing some invitations which was a heavier paper and they came out VERY curled. I've read elsewhere that the problem of sealed envelopes and curled paper is because the printer uses too much heat.The worst part is that after only 6 months I started having trouble with constant paper jams! I've heard other users with similar problems on other boards.I'm fed up with this printer and am going to buy a new one. This one was a waste of money!"
2,This one has a serious flaw,"I've been using these inexpensive Brother laser printers for about 15 years, this being my third one. They are basically bullet proof - cranking out good quality black and white printouts year after year. Brother has been tweaking the design, making each permutation a bit more reliable and substantially faster. Why they had to screw this one up is beyond me. The prior models had an adequate if slightly cumbersome envelope feeder. The 2070N envelope feeder is inadequate, too often allowing the envelope to turn and print at an unsightly if not unusable angle. I've had to throw away half my envelope printouts. If you don't want to print envelopes, this is an okay printer, otherwise, forget it."
3,Weird But Interesting!,I first watched Leprechaun's Christmas Gold when it was shown on the Family Channel and like another reviewer said it was kind of weird but it was good too especially if you have Irish ancestry! Though You don't have to be Irish to enjoy it! It's Weird but ineresting and should be on DVD!
5,Very Happy,"I am so happy that I was able to find this movie. This is one that I have been looking for, for over 3 years. My husband has had this movie on his wish list for a long time. Thank you!"
5,a Christmas Classic,I Just Love this Christmas movie I'm Irish too My favorite scene in the movie is when the witch starts crying the Banchie tears.
1,Not Really a Christmas Cartoon!,I know I will probably get all the over sensitive reviewers upset by typing that I don't like this Christmas cartoon but everyone is entitled to their opinions on if they like or dislike a product so if you are the type of person who gets angry when people don't like what you like or they like something you hate then perhaps you shouldn't be reading these reviews if you are intolorant of differences of opinions. In my opinion and I'm not saying that my opinion is the only opinion that matters but I'm just personally saying that I thought that Leprechaun's Christmas Gold was terrible. I'm Irish and I while I definitely liked the idea of an Irish Christmas cartoon I have to agree with the review that asked what the heck this has to do with Christmas except for a Christmas tree? What the heck does a Banshee have to do with Christmas?
3,Car washing brush,"The handle it very good but the brush it self a little to small. If I would order it again I would want a larger brush head on it !!Thank-you, Jimmy from Sdero Woolley, WA"
1,Poor poor quality,The threads that hold the head on to the handle were stripped and the head came off the first time I used this. It cannot be repaired. I'd return it but I'm not wasting any more of my time and money on this. I would not recommend.
4,Happy Dancing Music,Panamericana is a real family favorite CD of happy dancing music. These women have quite a vocal range and the variety of instruments add to the richness and depth. Lots of fun!I would have given the album 5 stars but two vocal selections by Olivier Conan are not easy to listen to-- he doesn't have the voice for it. Sorry. It is easier just to skip those songs and get on with the beautiful Blondes of North America.I look forward to the group's next CD.
3,Not as advertised,"I received a Rave MP2300 as a gift. Though Sennheisen earphones are advertised as included this is not the case. Cheap earbuds come with the product. Though I registered this product online immediately the support representative will not discuss the poorly functioning earbuds without proof of purchase. Since this was a gift, I do not have proof of purchase and I am stuck with this inferior product. If this is an example of customer support I am not recommending this product."
1,money up in smoke SIGH,i had this mp 3 for about 6 months worked great then poof like magic just kinda quit it will only read a few songs and skips all over on others or plays 10 seconds or so no customer support and i paid 130.00 to have this for 6 months or so what a piece of junk glad they went out of business sad people have to do business this way :(
2,nice but big and low sound,this a good mp3 but it is very big and ways more than my cd player. after a little time the clik disks get annoying because they dont hold that many songs each{about 9 each}so you have to get more and they r annoying to hold. also the volume cannot go high at all. the sound quality is very good and the files download on to it very fast.you also can see the song u r listin' to on the screen.i would noy recomend it for the sake of your $
5,JAZZMASTERS II,I FEEL THIS IS PAUL'S BEST CD YET OF HIS CURRENT TITLES. 90% OFTHE SONGS ARE EXCELLENT. I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING HIS SONGS SINCE THEVERY BEGINNING. HE JUST KEEPS IMPROVING.~WAITING FOR YOUR NEW CD PAUL!
1,This book was NOT new and it was sold as new.,"This book was not new, it had pen markings highlighted paragraphs . Very disappointed because I order a new b"
5,"Easy to read, informative, comprehendible.",The book is very easy reading. It has a good format and seems to have some good information. Good examples of analysis methods.
1,Another Fuse...,"It came with the stickers all peeling off. Used it for about a month and the item failed on me. Then the bad news, it blew the fuses in my car and all my electronics stopped working. Tried it on a friends car and I blew his fuses (car and person). Look for something else. Seems to be a common problem.UPDATE: Linksys replaced this product instantly. Works but a little worried it will fail again.UPDATE ON UPDATE: Died again..."
1,Not a quality item,"This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car. Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap."
1,Never worked,"About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling. It has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low -- well it sounded immediately . I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs. I hadn't tried to use it since. Now that I'm taking another trip, I thought I'd try it out in other cars. No luck. The thing is dead -- doesn't do a thing when I plug it in."
1,It is a horrible textbook,I am a graduate student. This book is a first horrible textbook I have had. It is very difficult to grasp the basic concepts from the book. And the content jumps all over the place. The author seems to have the ability to make simple things complicated.
4,Honda's first superbike.,"The book is very complete if you are a Honda's fan. You can enjoy and learn a lot about this Honda first superbike and about his creator. Also, you can read comments from the first pilot and its first race with a CB750. There some details about the construction and ideais around it that you may find only in this book. You can feel yourself being drawn back to the 60`s and the 70's."
4,Pretty good book,"I found this book to be a useful guide to the SOC Honda 750. It was not as detailed as to the year to year changes as I would have liked but none the less, it is an interesting and useful book."
5,Searchable Kinfolks on CD,"Great product. Great price for th CD. Not a scanned graphic version converted to a PDF but a searchable reproduction of Kinfolks. Great for locating a person when you know the Kinfolks index number or name. Don't wait, order your CD today."
2,light sensitive???,"It flashes when it moves all right, but not just in the dark when needed. It strobes in a well lit room. From the product description I thought I could leave it on the dog all the time, and it would only flash when in the dark. It is a distracting waste of batteries! A switch to shut it off would be great. You have to take the battery out or take it off the dog to shut it off. I keep mine near the door and only put it on the dog when we go out at night. ..........when I remember."
1,Guardian gear flashing light,not large enough for a big size dog as well as a dog with a lot of fur. Not recommendable for a Golden Retriever or larger dogs with lots of fur.Anne Marie Knudsen
2,did not receive,"Seller contacted me, as the edition date was wrong, it was too old a copy.order cancelled."
5,BRAWL: a Behind the Scenes Look at Mixed Martial Arts Compet,"I've been a huge fan of the Ultimate Fighting Championship since it first came out in 1994, and this book answered all my questions as to how the sport got started and why it was banned for a few years from cable. But along with describing the history of this contraversial sport, BRAWL also got deep into the lives of all my favorite fighters, such as Ken Samrock and Dan Severn. I always thought these guys were crazy for doing what they do, but after reading this book I realize there is much more behind the sport than just beating the tar out of each other: There is honor, pride, and tons of glory. This book is a must read for anyone who ever watched the UFC or wondered what went on behind the scenes of this brutal sport."
2,Boring Word for Word Summary of Fights,Formulaic book. Barely worth your time. The author purchased or borrowed DVDs of a bunch of big name fights and summarized what he saw. He supplements this with some interviews with the fighters themselves. It was not terrible but not very good.
4,Brawl - What I like about you.,"If you have any interest in martial arts especially the origins of U.F.C and Pride this book will be your cup of tea. Well written, though dated at this point in time, consider ""Brawl"" a history book of Mixed Martial Arts.The sport has evolved in a good way.The early days certainly focused on brutality as opposed to skill.Apparently the spirit of the Roman gladiators and the people who watched them lives on."
5,"Edgy, Crazy, Scary","I was mesmerized from the first few seconds: ""What IS this?!"" The fast editing, profanity, twists and turns of this movie are spellbinding. This is a flashback classic ""WhoDoneIt"" enveloped into a macabre comedic presentation. One of the best films I've seen to date."
2,Not like most vocal scores,"Most Piano/Vocal scores from Broadway and/or Hollywood include guitar chords in addition to the piano and vocal lines. Most of the songs within this songbook do NOT have the guitar chords published. For piano 'fakers', the chord designations are a must. This is a serious deficiency in this songbook.On the positive side, all the great music and songs expected were present, and as far as I can tell, with the original piano arrangements."
4,inexpensive and cute,"I got this Spongebob speaker system at KMart for $17.00. I didn't think the sound quality would be that great for that price, but it was all I could find for speakers. I was really surprised at how clear the sound is! It runs off 4 AA batteries, or there is an AC adapter. You can plug a cd player or an MP3 player into it. With a cd player you just separate the speakers and plug in the stereo audio cable, and with an ipod you can mount it on a shelf in between the speakers. Actually the directions say other mp3 players besides ipods will not fit on the shelf, but I have a Creative Zen Vision M and it fits perfectly! There are much better speakers out there obviously, but for the cheap price and the entertainment value of SpongeBob these are great:-)"
5,Great seat!,"We have been using this for the last 2 weeks and we love it...and so does our baby girl. The vibrate is pretty powerful, but it seems to do the trick. The music seems to be at a good volume, and this seat is so comfy I wish they made it in adult sizes. We highly recommend this seat."
2,"cozy, boring, BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU WASH THE COVER","I agree with many of the reviews that the seat is cozy and plush for a newborn. We registered for it because it doesn't look garish in our small condo, and because it looks so comfy for a newborn. My daughter was never really soothed by the vibration/music feature, but it's a good place to put her when I need to take a shower or prepare her bath. However, when we washed the cover, the padding MELTED in the dryer. There is no warning about this anywhere--only a weak mention of drying on low heat--and Fisher Price should be a little more explicit about the potential for this problem. Given the price for it and the short term use of it, I was hoping to pass it onto one of my several friends who are expecting, but now it's not in any shape to share."
3,great for newborns,My baby loved this as a newborn. It looks so comfy and he really seemed to enjoy it. He really did not like it once he became aware of things around him. There is nothing for him to look at and he gets bored quickly in it. I bought the Bobblin Band bouncer seat from Fisher Price and he LOVES that. He will sit in it for a long time and be happy. So this is really only good for very small babies. After that it is a waste.
3,Seat is fine except vibration turns off after 20 min.,"Comfy seat but when vibration turns off, our colicky kid woke up every time. Ended up buying linkadoos seat with vibration that only stopped if the batteries ran out."
4,Great night's sleep for baby & mom!,"I bought this baby seat for my son who is 5 weeks old b/c I thought it might help him sleep better at night(which would mean I sleep better too)...and thank goodness I was right!He doesn't like to be flat on his back and I was constantly having to hold him on my chest in bed with me to get him to fall asleep. Now I put the baby papasan in his pack n play next to our bed and he sleeps for 3-4 hour streches at a time. I guess he likes the way it cradles him. And it gives great support to floppy newborns. We have a normal bouncy seat and he was constantly slouching down in it.It's also very light and portable. I carried my son downstairs in one arm and the seat in the other.The only drawback of it is that it seems like he's going to outgrow it to soon. I already have the straps that hold him in loosened almost all the way, so there's not much room for growth."
3,Newborn to 5 months A-...older kids C+,"Mom of twins: I loved this seat for my son, who was mellow and a sleeper when we brought him home. The music and vibration were great and just long enough for him to fall asleep. My daughter never took to the seat since the seat curves too deeply on a shorter baby. My son's feet rested on the support bar at about 2 months, and he banged his feet on it when frustrated...made the house rumble. Would like to see more padding there. The mirror is neat during the ""identity"" phase, but is soon useless. Great pack-n-go ability. Last week (son is 6 months, 25 inches and 20 lbs.), I removed the inner support for newborns. Son is not as comfy and obviously bored. Manufacturers need to make a comfy seat like Papasan for supported sitters to 24 months. The foam/plastic seats only go to 22 lbs."
2,Absolutely Not Worth the Cost...,"This was not a very wise purchase on my part. I wish I'd done a little more research when looking for a bouncer (why this even comes up in a search for bouncers is beyond me...it doesn't bounce!). My son only used this a handful of times. The vibrating made him instantly upset, and while it's a nice feature that the music shuts off on it's own, there should be a setting to make it stay on for longer if you so choose. There was NO bouncing with this chair, so he just kind of sat there...bored. I used it more as a place to set him while I did a quick chore or two around the house. In the end I think this chair is WAY overpriced for what it is...basically a stationary seat with some very soft cushions and a little vibration and music. I say pass...you can find better for cheaper."
2,boring for my child,"I must say that every child is different so I am jufdging this product according to what I could experience with my newborn daughter. I chose this item thinking it was a bouncer but IT IS NOT. It doesn't bounce it vibrates which is different. Some babies love the vibrating sensation but my daughter did not. I tried a friends bouncer and she slept beautifully there. Unfortunately, you have to try it before you get it, and I say unfortunatelly because how are you going to try something unless you buy it or borrow it from someone."
3,"Good for resting/napping, but otherwise...","This infant seat has been useful, primarily to keep my newborn baby close by while I cook, clean, etc. For my son it has essentially served as a portable ""crib"" while he naps, or as a place for him to rest for 5-10 minutes at a time while he's awake. I do like that this seat offers an alternative to having him lie flat on his back...and it also offers a more relaxed body position for the baby compared to his regular car seat (where he is more upright). Unfortunately I was very disappointed to discover that the music & vibration do not calm, entertain, stimulate or otherwise appear to affect my baby at all! I thought the vibration mode would be more stimulating or bouncy, but it is SO subtle! Since this is my first baby - and my first vibrating infant seat - I don't know if all such seats offer the same (lack of) intensity, but if they do then I guess my baby is just immune to the ""magic"" vibrations (at least so far, and he is already 3+ months old)!"
2,Enh..,"I ordered this for my newborn and it's just ok. The biggest complaint I have is that it doesn't bounce at all. Which if I had read the description of the product better I would have noticed that. My child is two months now and I don't see him being able to fit in this two months from now. The leaf with the mirror hasn't been noticed by my baby. On the upside, he is pretty snug in the seat and it folds up nicely. I propbably wouldn't have bought this if I had it to do over again. I'd have looked for something else."
3,Helpful for a short time,"For a brand new baby, this chair really served a purpose. It gave us a secure and comfy place to put our daughter so that she could be up at the table with us. She liked pulling the little velcroed toy off the toy arm. She never got into the vibration, and this chair never helped her calm down. She never napped in it. It was just a really handy place to put her so that we could eat. She started trying to sit up pretty early, and we realized this chair wasn't safe anymore.In the end, I wish we'd gotten a bouncer for her. I think it would've lasted longer and done more to soothe her."
3,Great until you turn 3 months old.,"My folks had this at their house for when our baby visited. It is soft, comfy, and she loved it. Until she was 3 months old, and she was too tall for it! And she's only in the 40% for height! Your money will be much better spent on a more traditional bouncer that can accomodate a taller and bigger infant."
2,Not worth the money for me!,"It is only my opinion, but this seat was to expensive and my baby does not like it at all. I bought this for a means of having a place to put my baby to get some moments of free time, I know no baby is alike but mine will NOT sit in this for more than a minute, it really does nothing you can barely feel it move and the music only got his attention the very first time he sat in it. the mirror and rabbitt dont do anything for him, I wish I had saved the money and bought the swing in this collection."
3,Nice but....,This seat worked very nice for my newborn before she could start to focus with her eyes. It was very boring for her and she would cry. I went and got her the fisher price aquar. seat and she will sit for hours and watch the bubbles and fish. I would suggest buying a seat that has something in front of baby to watch.
5,Loved this! Lifesaver!,"I received this as a baby shower gift & loved it! We used it all the time until she was about 6 months and then loved crawling around. It was a lifesaver for me and husband. She loved sleeping in it, or falling asleep in it. Soft & comfortable. Easy to travel around with, easy to clean, vibrations not too strong, music not too loud. Definitely would recommend if you don't have money for a baby swing."
4,"I like it, but I bought it for cheaper.","I bought this directly from the Fisher Price website for I believe the $35- $40 range on sale. I like it just fine. It fits easily in my bathroom and I can put the baby in it while I take a shower. She can get by 15 minutes with no vibration or music until she gets bored. Then she will get by with 15 minutes of vibration and music before she gets bored again. By that time, I am showered and dressed. I wouldn't pay the regular price for it though."
3,My baby didn't like it...,"This looked like a nice seat, but my baby never seemed to like it much. He would always start crying after a few minutes in it. However, it seems comfortable and the vibration mode seems like it would be soothing. I did use the seat quite a bit for the first couple months when I would need to set my baby down, but he could only stay in for a few minutes. He never fell asleep in the chair."
3,Not a cure all...,"We bought this for our daughter but she didn't like it all too much. She could only stand it for about ten minutes at a time and after about a month, she was too big for it. Don't buy this and expect your baby to just sleep in it all the time. Not all babies will like it. Our daughter is most happy and content with a plain rocking chair or just being walked around in someone's arms the good old fashioned way, which is kind of a pain, but soon she won't want to be held all the time so I'll get some closeness while I can. =)"
5,Wonderful,"When my son wouldn't sleep, this was great because he had reflux so it propped his body up and the vibration relaxed him so that he could relax and sometimes even nap in this. We love this!"
2,THIS CHAIR IS VERY PRETTY BUT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING,THIS CHAIR DOES NOT BOUNCE IT IS VERY STIFF AND THE VIBRATING DIDN'T DO A THING FOR MY CHILD. I HAVE ANOTHER CHAIR SIMILIAR BUT IT BOUNCES AND HAS A LITTLE MASSAGER FOR THE BACK THAT ONE IS A LIFE SAVER HE GOES RIGHT TO SLEEP IN IT. THE ONE I LIKE IS FISHER PRICE.
1,$50 childs toy,"I wanted this papsan to match the cradle swing...I ended up getting both, my daughter liked the papsan until she was about 2 weeks old...never liked the vibrations or the music...but, once she got a taste of the swing, the papsan sat in the closet. I'm planning on letting her use it for her baby dolls when she is older. Not worth $50."
3,"OK, but they grow out of it quickly",Our 3 month old son used this chair since we brought him home. A nice reclined chair however it didn't seem to help his acid reflux. We also had problems with the plastic music box attached at the bottom of the chair. He kicks like crazy and there's very little padding around the box. One day he split open his heels while sitting in the chair and kicking the box.
3,Not a must have for all babies,In July 2005 I gave birth to 2 twin girls. Everyone told me that I HAD to have a bouncer chair. So I put 2 on my register thinking all babies love bouncer seats (and I only put one swing on my register since everyone said not all babies love swings)So my girls hated them. They used them really only when company came over so that people could look at them without really holding them all the time. So maybe 5 times.Now my swing I had to buy 3 more..one more for home and 2 more at work.So if you are having more then one only buy one of anything...no matter how many people tell you it is a must have for all.
4,papason,"We have not used this product yet, but everything seems to be in order. The product arrived in a very timely manner and was in excellent condition."
1,This Swing does not Swing,"This swing does not swing, it hardly moves when turned on. I am very unhappy with my purchase and wish I had not ordered this product online. It is impossible to get it back into the box once assembled and by the time I would get my money back for it my baby will have grown out of it."
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER,I am a first time parent and my sister told me that this was not a good product. I bought it anyway and I have regreted spending the money on it every time I have used it.
3,Hmmm....had some issues.,This was great but I had an issue with the fact that my child's legs were hanging off the edge...even as a newborn.I liked the little mirror and the bunny. The music and vibrations were obviously what we were looking for and this was fine for that. Just the length was an issue. I have tried others and didn't have the same problem.
3,I wish it was bigger,"Loved that the entire seat was washable and the music is enjoyable even for me, but we were only able to use the seat for two months before baby was too big for it. Her heels would rub against the metal frame when she kicked. Also found that baby would fall asleep to vibration but would wake up when it stops. Batteries didn't last long. Buy used!"
4,very nice seat,This is a great seat for a newborn. It's soft and the vibrations and music are wonderful. It would have been perfect if it was a bouncer too but still a wonderful seat to lay your baby in.
5,Better sleeper & great for transport,"While I also received a Bobby Cradle in Comfort seater and was very much considering returning this Fisher Price seater (who needs two?), I ended up keeping it and so glad that I did. This piece is actually very easy to transport (has the side handles and legs fold down), it fits trough our backdoor without having to tilt it - my daughter loves being outside and sleep - and it's good for sleeping. The Bobby seat is more reclined and better for sitting up for looking around and this Fisher Price one is more for sleeping and lying down, allowing room to stretch all the way."
5,Awsome...Awsome!! :),"We are on our second little one and this seat has come in handy BOTH times. I got it for my baby shower the first time around and my daughter slept and hung out with me in the kitchen in this. Now I have a second daughter and she is sleeping and hanging out it in. Great investment. As another person said, not very useful after the child begins to roll over and be more active, but it is fantastic for newborns. I would recommend this seat to any new mom! Most importantly, it gives you a place to put baby that is not in the car seat or crib. It is comfy, vibrates and plays music. What more could a baby want? And mom, you can have your hands free for other things."
4,Nice place for baby to sleep,I registered for the baby papasan bouncer before they updated it and I was upset because they had discontinued it and I had to take it off of my registry. Then while shopping at babies r us I found the new seat and my son loves it. He can sleep in it for hours! The leaf that is above the seat has a mirror for him to look at and a removable rabbit that is cute. I am glad that we have this one and not the older style. We also have the fisher price aquarium bouncer and find that our son will fall asleep in the papasan but seems more entertained in the aquarium seat. He is only 6 weeks old and I think that we will end up getting more use out of the aquarium bouncer as he gets older. Overall I think this is a great seat and would recommend it to anyone with a newborn.
4,PapaSan is great,"My son loved this seat from day one. He likes it much more than even his crib. The vibrating + music calms him most of the time and he sleeps in it for hours.The downside's the available music and amount of time that the unit runs. There is only 1 ""meddly"" available. The ""runtime"" before the vibrating/music stops is about 15 minutes. After that you have to cycle the power for it to start again. Three C batteries last about 2-3 weeks with moderate usage."
1,complete waste of money,"please do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this product. I love the swing and highly recommend the brand but this seat is a waste. I have twins and currently own 6 bouncy seats. These are by far the WORST product that I have come across from FP. I think as adults we look at it and think ""Hmmmm fluffy and comfy -- if I was a baby thats where I would want to be"". There are two main issues with this chair1. most babies (7 of the 8 I know) grow out of this in three months2. the vibration turns off after 15 minutes and most babies wake upbuy the Sensory Selections bouncer by FP. I am still using it 6 months later. Everyone that bought the papasan chair that I know is upset at the high cost and low functionality. Two other mommys subsequently bought the Sensory selections oneTry to find a used one if you really think that it is great. The whole thing is washable so you don't have to worry about cleaning another kids germs off"
4,Clear and Comprehensive guide,"This is an excellent manual in every respect. It is well written, with the owner-mechanic in mind, and the illustrations and diagrams are extremely clear and helpful. It provides detailed step by step instructions for testing components, which other manuals do not always give.The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that it only covers cars sold on the North American market. This means, for example, that it does not cover the L Jetronic fuel injection system fitted to many E28 BMWs sold in other markets (such as my own 1985 525i). For information on this system you will need to refer to either a specialist book on Bosch fuel injection systems, or the Haynes Manual covering all 3 & 5 series from 1983 to 1991 (Haynes manual 1948).If you own any E28 and can only afford one manual, the Bentley publication is far and away the best available."
4,E28 Manual,Very good manual. Carefully written and quite accurate. It is worth the money as it was well compiled.
5,"Great drawings practical detailed, easy to use & understand.",This is a great book. Well laid out with fabulous line drawings that actually let you understand the repair. Suitable even for relatively unskilled mechanics. Good tips and very easy to use. Contains more information than any other manual out there for these cars. I recommend it even if you never work on your car since it helps you understand it better and with its handy diagnostic tables will let you prediagnose problems and keep your mechanic honest. Buy it if you have an E28 5 series. It doesn't cover the M5 though.
4,Works with XP but takes some tinkering,"I read all the reviews so I was expecting some extra work to get this print server working with XP. The trick is using a static IP address, not DHCP. Go ahead and install the ""BI Admin"" utility because it allows you to configure the print server via a browser page, but use a static IP address. And just enter that same static IP when you configure your printer port (printer properties, add TCP/IP port). Linksys tech support can help - although this is yet another company that has outsourced tech support to the Phillipines and India. That's a big check mark against them in my book."
2,Not quite ready for Prime Time,"The combination of a switch with a print server would have been great. The switch worked prefectly, 3 ports and an uplink, or 4 ports. The print server is not smart enough to handle bi-directional printers. Mine is an Epson 870, the printserver driver was a problem to install both on NT and W2K (3 tries to get some funtionality) and then it would generate errors indicating the connection from the printer to the PC didn't work. Still looking ..."
4,Perfroms as advertised,"I have used this model with my cable modem (MediaOne, now AT&T) for the past 6 months. Currently running 1.37 version of firmware. Able to securely access (ftp) archival files from my home NT server from work (great for traveling consultants!).Would strongly consider 8 port model, which was introduced 6 weeks after my purchase, for additional QoS features and switching performance."
1,Linksys Etherfast 10/100 4 Port Switch with Print Server Mod,"I print large graphic images (about 10 meg) to a Epson Photo Ex. Using LPT1: parallel port these image complete in under 5 minutes. Recently I purchased a Linksys EFSP42 Printerserver. Printing the same image through the EFSP42 Printserver takes over an hour. I have isolated the problem to the Epson printer driver used. If I use a dumbed down Epson driver from Windows 98 disk (specifically Epson Stylus Color ESC/P2) then the speed through the Linksys EFSP42 PrintServer is comparable to parallel port LPT1-- however image quality is very poor. Linksys technical support first indicated I had a defective unit. I replaced the unit and had the same results. Now I'm told I should return the unit because it is incompatible with my Epson Photo Ex (sure, now tell me after I toss all the packing). Linksys documentation maintains compatibility with Epson but don't believe it!!"
5,Router/Print Server,"Purchased as a spare, but the old one just keeps on chugging along--and it's about 10-12 years old! This one is sitting on a shelf, waiting to be needed."
2,Doesn't work with older printers,"The print server works flawlessly with my Mac running OS X 10.1, however the Win98 Machines refuse to print. Printing to a Laserwriter Personal NTR (Apple printer, standard Cannon engine) the Windows machines get a ""printer not ready"" error. This may be to the fact the the printer only works if the PC's port is configured as ""ECP"", and (I believe) the port drivers use EPP. Any ideas? Drop me a note. mrattan@home.com"
1,Terrible with Win2000,"I purchased this unit May 2001 and am ready to take it back. It may work well on older networks, but with a pure Windows Network and Window 2000, it is a loss. It does have full documentation for Netware, DOS and such, but there is no mention of Windows 2000 anywhere in the documentation nor a support page on the website for w2k and this unit. I did find a w2k driver at the mfr website, but no other information. The 16bit bi-directional utility promptly hung my normally super-reliable server system. The manual says you have to install IPX/SPX also, but based on other information in the manual, that may not be true. Also, if used with (really great) the LinkSys DSL router, it appears that if the system is not started up in the right order the IP address will change and you may have to re-set everything."
3,Printer Server,"I purchased the Print server for a Macintosh network. I was looking to move my Epson 1520 to the server, so I could remove the printer from one of the mac actting as a server. It did not work at all as a Mac Print server, I wish apple would of left the local talk on the machines. I was able to get it to work from Virtual PC on my Mac, so the networking was setup correctly. I was also slow as a hub with the macs. They are all 100mb machines, and when connected they ran slower than the 10mb hub that they were connected to. This box is a good idea, I wish that you could setup with the Macs, because we need a way to connect these stupid parrallel printers that we use now, since lost the network printers."
4,Great all-in-one product,"I bought this because I needed a printer switch. Imagin my suprise when I found a 4 port switch and a print server, all in one unit, for a few dollars more than the printer switch I was looking to buy.As a network Administrator I will be looking forward to see what other products linksys will be producing."
1,Really Bad,I am still not able to set up the server with my simple network. My network works well with my Net gear router but can not find the print server.
2,Snooze Jazz,"I buy smooth jazz for incredible beats coupled with the typical covers of old R&B hits. This disk has neither. With the exception of ""Trippin' Rhythms"", this CD is a flop. Don't get me wrong here, I love ""Trippin' Rhythms"" and it is a 5 star ditty worthy of putting on ""repeat"" on your player or iPod, but a CD is more than one little song."
3,Okay wasn't the best,"Thought that this cd was rather disapointing. Too many different styles in this album. ""London in Springtime"" and ""London Chimes"" are exactly the same on has vocals the other doesn't. But anyway, it is still a good cd and you should put it in the collection."
2,WHAT A SHOCK..,"This cd was givin to me as a gift and I'm glad it was because it would have been a waste of money. There is only one good song on the whole cd, ""Lost In Space."" There is way to many vocal songs on a ""smooth jazz"" cd. Paul uses the same backround in many of the songs which makes you feel as if you are listening to one long, never ending,song. I despised the group until one day i heard and fell in love with their ""GREATEST HITS."" And thankfully ""Lost in Space"" is on there. I recommend buying that cd, it should be in every smooth jazz fans collection."
5,PAUL HARDCASTLE OUTDID HIMSELF AGAIN!!!,"If you are new to jazz or have not heard of many Jazz musicians Paul Hardcastle will truly make you a fan of jazz and also of his works. The combitation of vocals and instrumentials in this album are outstanding,what i consider a great piece of work and music. Paul Hardcastle can take you away from the stress of everyday living and let you relax and enjoy. I am truly thankful for Paul Hardcastle and his music it has made me a person that can appreciate and enjoy good music. Keep them coming Paul..."
2,"If I wanted singing, I'd buy Sade!","Oh, please!! It starts out promising... the first cut does capture your interest. However. EVERY OTHER SONG HAS SINGING FROM THAT POINT ON! This drove me crazy. Just as the listener gets into the groove (as much as you can with what sounds like synthesized music)the next track has that nauseating woman singing. Don't bother with this one."
2,Can 24 reviewers be wrong??,"After reading the reviews above, and in search of some great new smooth jazz, I bought this album and I am very disappointed. I wrote this review to balance the raves above, so that some of you might check twice before parting with your precious cash. This is not really jazz, but more soft electronic fusion soul. Many of the tracks, especially the second half of the album, are little more than programmed synth' beat with overdone bass. I found many of the tracks too monotonous even for background music, though did enjoy the rework of Steve Nicks', Dreams. Perhaps my expectation was too high, but I think there are much better examples of smooth jazz. Don't make the same mistake I made. Judge it for yourself, and don't be too influenced by the rave reviews above."
5,I bought it last week and I cant stop playing it. Great CD.,"Paul Hardcastle brought me back to music from talk radio. His melodies are unique and contagious. If you are looking for an alternative from the noise that passes for music today, please start with this CD. He has developed a style that is his alone. I heard the ""lost in space"" track on a smooth jazz station and knew immediately that Hardcastle has a new CD. You must try it."
4,Solid Debut,"Relapse Record's latest edition to their impressive metalcore catalouge is definitely worth checking out. Uphill Battle mixes metalcore with stonergrind very well. Their self titled debut might not be one for the record books, but it sure is making a dent on modern metalcore. Though losing the pure fury they had on their spilt with Anubis Rising (tracks like ""Crawl Space"" are just insane). With some fairly furious riffing and drum work; not to mention some decent vocals, Uphill Battle creates a decent grind atmophere with this release. Song wise, it is not very diverse, sticking to the same structure and sound for most of the album, never really vearing off course, allowing it to get old fairly quickly. Well songs like ""Forked Tounge"", ""The Stench is Spreading"", and ""Climax Control"" really sum up the album, they are all solid grind tracks with great riffing. This is great for fans of Benumb, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, or Shadows Fall. Definitely worth the cash."
3,Surrender,"This book has a different perspective from most self-help books that emphasize willpower. Written by a Mormon for other Mormons, it has many helpful points while framing the overall issue in terms of surrendering to God. This perspective may make the book not so useful for people with different belief systems."
2,"Description deceptive, no mention of LDS for LDS","Perhaps a great book for LDS, but unfortunately description is a long ways from transparent for what turns out to be constant reference of scripture, Joseph Smith and quotes of presidents of LDS church."
4,Worth Reading Once,"This book helped me to realize how unbalanced my life is what I can do to have a healthy emotional life.My only issue with the book is its length. Although the message is important, I think the message could have been given in 20 pages. The only reason it's longer is because publishers don't publish 20 page books.I would recommend taking notes while reading and then reselling the book when you're done."
1,Seller and shippings fault,The seller was the problem. All he had was junk. The first one never made it. The second 2 ports worked. Gave seller bad reveiw after giving back money. Unsatisfied.
4,Not for the weak at heart,"Unputdownable! A very intense, super-charged atmosphere!Recounts four months in the life of a married mother after her husband leaves her abruptly for the love of a 20-year-old girl. The severe depression ensuing from her husband's betrayal and abandonment hits rock bottom. She is left to fend by herself, to take care of two kids and a dog. As in similar cases of acute depression, she becomes, sleepy, lethargic, disoriented, clumsy and neglectful of her self and her kids. She is transformed into the nemesis of her true self: angry, vulgar, ugly, dirty and, in a failed attempt at getting back at her husband, almost prostitutes herself with a stranger.This is a roller-coaster of emotions, anger, childhood memories and soul searching episodes the reader feels suffocated and in desperate need of a breather. The characterization is superb and real, the protagonists are almost tangible.Take a deep breath and plunge in."
4,Tough going,Ferrante's depiction of what it is like for a young Italian woman with young children to be abandoned is so unstintingly honest that it is hard to believe that there could not be an autobiographical element to the story.
4,Compelling Read,Very basic and honest description of what it's like to be deserted by husband. Compelling read hard to put down.
5,difficult emotional read,Difficult emotional read. Not for someone who is divorcing or who has just divorced. The second book I have read of hers. I will read more of Elena Ferrante's books.
1,Just Awful,"I can't stand books where a dog suffers in disgusting detail. This book was so over the top that I couldn't feel any sympathy for this obsessed woman. The only thing ""stunning"" about it was how stunningly repetitive and tedious it quickly became."
1,Very irritating and upsetting book,"It's not very often that I hate a book, but I hated this one. At the beginning of the novel, I thought it seemed promising, however by a quarter of the way through, I grew increasingly irritated with the main character. At first she evoked sympathy, but she become a maddening idiot as the store unfolded.The main character is unable to use a cell phone or figure out how to repair her land line, or even open the front door to her apartment.She also displays unspeakable cruelty to a poor dog. If you are an animal lover, avoid this book. I wish someone had warned me."
4,The Underbelly of a Wife Discarded,"Interesting read. Talented writer. Dark narrative. Much of this story is in the form of internal angst. For this reason, it may not appeal to everyone. For myself I would have liked more external conflict. Also, I did not find this to be a ""...comic novel"" as reviewed. It is dark, troubling and potent."
5,Perfect Gallery Frame,"Take a lot of photos. I ordered 8 of these frames and couldn't be happier with the purchase. A simple, lightweight black frame is the perfect home for colour or B&W; photos and this one is a winner. I matched them up with white mats from the same seller and for fraction of the cost I have 8 beautifully professional looking framed photos on my walls.And to top it off they arrived 5 days ahead of the 'estimated delivery date'"
2,Picture Book,"This is just a picture book. It's best suited for my two year old boy who loves airplanes. Nothing inciteful, no in-depth history, no meat. Only a dozen pages of text. But I must admit, the photos are great. I purchased this book for my father (a 57/67 flight instructor). I was too embarrassed to give it to him. I found another book. He'll get a late Christmas gift."
2,Writer's Digest Usual Rip-Off,"I read this book when it first was published in 1988.The book is neither interesting nor useful. Dibell's main contribution is his ideas on cause and effect, but they are neither plentiful nor profound but only merely pertinent to an idea of plot which is the central topic for discussion.Dibell's writing is pedestrian and the examples he provides are either too general or technically too broad to be of use for specific, technical problems concerning plot or plot structure.This is a book that promises much but which doesn't deliver on its promises except for the mere basic threads without which one could not write a book on plot at all.There is a very good reason why mine is the only review on this book since it first came out 24 years ago. This book is a rip-off, as are most books pushed by Writer's Digest."
3,Surprise,"After viewing this DVD, I was quite surprised to notice that there were some parts missing. I guess that everything could not have been copied to make it look like the original which I saw on TV, but still for the price, it should have been complete and put into 5 discs instead of 4. Overall, the viewing was good, but I felt it was missing quite a bit......"
3,"OK but not great like ""Cuidado Con El Angel""","The story is not as romantic as the movie ""Cuidado Con El Angel"" which stars the same actress.Also, the story is not as romantic as the movie ""En Nombre Del Amor"" which stars the same actor."
4,Estuvo buena.,"La novela es buena, cuenta con todos los elementos de la típica telenovela. La edición está bien resumida, aunque al principio se aleja de la historia principal y llegando al final, una historia la dejaron inconclusa eso si, lo anterior no afecta el desenlace de la historia. Si le llama la atención, vale la pena comprarla. Y para descubrir en que termina la historia inconclusa se puede averiguar en la Red, no es algo trascendental para el fin de la telenovela pero si es rico saberlo."
5,"TriEssent, Inc is a good place to buy from","I ordered this card from TriEssent, Inc. Before shipping the card it was tested and found to be defective. TriEssent, Inc emailed me to inform me about the problem with the card and that my order was cancelled for me by TriEssent, Inc.I really appreciate this kind of honesty. Instead of sending me a bum product, TriEssent, Inc. saved me a lot of grief. I will feel confident ordering anything from this company in the future.I can't give the product 5 stars but I do give TriEssent, Inc. 5 stars.Rick MulchinSalt Lake City, Utah"
1,plug and no play,"I bought this unit to replace a 4 year old Linksys ethernet card that required a connecting adapter. That unit became unreliable because of intermittent contacts so I bought the ""integrated"" PCM 100 unit to (hopefully) solve my problems. It doesn't work at all. The ""plug and play"" instructions are a joke, and the backup Windows 98 instructions didn't get past step 1. No ""Wizard"" appears when it is connected.I called for tech help - which is not toll-free. It is provided 10 hours per day, 5 days per week. I was on hold 25 minutes and then was disconnected. I called again and was put on hold again. Finally, I got a person who could not diagnose the problem but said the unit may be defective. I have to return it. I can't get my money back. ..."
1,Doesn't work as well as rumored...,"I bought this card thinking it would work well with my computer--which, unfortunately, has Windows ME. Every time I tried to install the drivers (and I did follow the manual, thankyouverymuch), my computer would freeze. I went to Linksys's webiste and downloaded the new driver for ME (which didn't even come on the driver disk!). A computer-savvy friend and I tried everything, including reinstalling ME, to get the card to work, but eventually I ended up returning it and getting a (smaller and cooler) 3Com card instead."
1,Serious problems with WinMe,I've done everything I can think of short of paying the long distance charge to call tech support to get this card to work. I've decided to sell the card to a friend and get another one that will work with WinMe.
3,No picture,"What does the dongle look like? Is it secure, do you have to worry about it breaking? Is the plug integrated into the card, or is it merely a dongle cord that connects to the card? Does it fasten securely, or have you had problems with it coming loose? (Like the other Linksys cards)"
4,"A bit bulky, yet tight design","A pleasant and very welcome alternative to the 'dongle' type LAN adapter for the Laptop PC. It was a breeze in my Windows XP machine, and Windows 98 worked fine. Windows 95 required the setup disk, but a very good performer. Although hard to mess up, Good job still for led placement and usefulness Linksys.THE ONLY COMPLAINT -If you have a INSPIRON 5000 series, or similar form factor, you know that the power plug was ignorantly placed next to the PCMCIA slots. Therefore the size of this card's slightly oversized plug-in 'port' was uncomfortable. Hope this was helpful."
3,Presumptuous,"This book's layout looks very much like a family album (a plus). On the other hand, the children's portraits consist mainly of face-shots in a dark background with quotes and pseudo-poetry scattered throughout the book. I was looking for inspiration, but I came out disappointed. There isn't a single photo that I can point out as exceptional or unique.I also looked at Geddes work, but she is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Her work is too elaborate and contrived."
1,Absolute [..],"Undoubtedly, the worst cd of any kind (one positively cannot call it music) that I have ever purchased. I will not be as forgiving as others who might have rated it so. This cd is an exact example of someone, completely without talent, who happens to have clout enough to deliver a product. One song was played at the discotheque, one mediocre disco ditty. Unfortunately, some genius decided that the rest of the cd needed more of the same garbage. This recording takes redundancy to new levels of ad nauseam. All the audio on this cd is horrible, it is truly that bad.So, if you are interested in expanding your musical horizons and are looking for something unique, erotic, sensual, or sexual, search items such as; Erotic Rhythms From Earth--Govinda, Suck It and See--Various Artists, MCMXC A. D.--Enigma, or Karma--Delerium should do the trick for starters."
2,JUNK,The only thing good about the CD is the artwork. This group has no talent and it is not erotic at all. DO NOT waste your time & mney like i did.
5,Wonderful reference book...,"This book is a must for anyone who has read or is reading The Crying of Lot 49 and is somewhat confused by the allusions and references Pynchon makes throughout the book. From facts about Thurn and Taxis to an entry explaining who Ringo Star is (just in case you didn't know already), it is a wonderful reader to put amongst the Pynchon section of your bookshelf."
3,"Helpful, But Misses Some Key Points","Grant's companion was very helpful in explaining contexts and allusions. It seemed to, however, miss a lot about the novel, especially Pynchon's dealing with the drug culture of the 60's. Its a solid companion that explains most modern critical interpretations of Pynchon, but such a great novel deserves better"
1,Garbage,"I got one of these for Christmas 2005. It worked well for about five months and then the bottom drive made a loud cracking sound. After that it no longer recognized discs. I/O Magic replaced the machine with a different model that had a smaller, inferior LCD display. After only two days of use, the bottom drive started rejecting any blank CD I put into it. This duplicator is a piece of crap so I'd advise you to not buy anything from I/O Magic. Spend a little more money and get something that will work."
2,Mind of its own,"I bought the 2003 version for my son last week. It effectively blocks sites in the selected categories, but also blocks some benign sites even if I specify them to always be 'trusted sites'. The only way to get to these sites is to remove ALL restrictions, which defeats the purpose of the product. I had to uninstall and reinstall after W98 starting giving me a startup error msg which suggested that content Barrier wasn't loading. Email to Intego tech support has not been answered. Calling them only lets you leave a voice mail. Can't seem talk to a human. Sorry I bought it."
4,happy,"I loved this product, I do birthday parties, & the kids enjoyed them very much. Just one little problem they don't really stay closed."
4,"Wonderful, colorful, educational!",I choose this book to do a Read Aloud for my daughter's fifth grade class this past March. The students thoroughly enjoyed it. The colorful illustrations and the exciting tales had many of the students wanting to hear more of the stories. I read theAmerican Indian tales to correspond with their current classroom projects. This book is a fun way to learn about different cultures and beliefs.
3,"Awesome, but too narrow","My husband really liked this tie for Father's day, but the tie itself is a little narrow. We both wish it was even just a half inch thicker so you don't see the back of the tie. Delivery was on time and great."
3,Critical Thinking Level C Review,"I bought this book thinking it was something different, but was not completely disappointed. Since I was interested in a particular book with the same title by Steck-Vaughn that was comprised only of small paragraphs on various subjects, my review is somewhat biased because I wanted more 'stories', i.e., main-idea type paragraphs. The book only has a few, but the other exercises to practice prediction, inference, categories, etc., are good if you want quick exercises. Images are provided which are good. Some of the subject matter is repetitive and can be dialogue-heavy."
3,Mains Ignition - Turn On,"Funky stuff from Mains Ignition on their debut TURN ON. With plenty of psychedelia and a tongue firmly in cheek (how else are you supposed to react to like ""Swedish Girls""?), the tracks show a good amount of rock influence. Though it's not all the case: the beats and blips of ""Sega Mullett"" are planted firmly in the electronic world. But the syncopated drums, funk bass, and wailing vocals of ""Ching Ching Tuff Chaser"" definitely straddle both worlds successfully. ""Vampires"" isn't as successful, however, but the twangy Western of ""Ming Mong"" recoups what was lost. The final track, ""Mains, To Go,"" has some nice cinematic horns to round out a fun album."
5,Warning: addicts beware!!,"Okay, [...] if you are a mature artist you will probably benefit from the the techniques found in this book. I'd put it at an beginning to intermediate level."
3,ok but not what I wanted,This book has a section on front wheel drive cars which is what made me buy it in the first place. It basically states that the author doesn't know much about it and that the people who do are not going to share the info anytime soon. He states that the section provides more questions than answers and I agree. The rest of the book is ok except for the parts where he recommends other books like tune to win by carrol smith which is a good book. People who are lucky enough to be involved in rwd racing will like this book because its not bad at all it just didn't cover what I needed.
3,fair to middlin,"Certainly some astounding material here, but scattered through-out. The first three rather long tracks tend to drag a bit (though the title track Mirror Man has some amazing vocal passages). Things get a lot more interesting on the 'shorter' tracks. John French drums with frightning power and precision on Kandy Korn. Beatle Bones and Smoking Stones is a funny comment on two other then-current 60's bands, but track that gets me is Moody Liz- it starts off sounding like just another rock-jam when suddenly the guitars veer off into wildest chords i've ever heard! It's almost like experiencing an acid flashback -if there is such a thing, which i doubt. Gimme Dat Harp is a high powered blues stomp -great stuff. At this point in time it seemed that the captain and the magic band were switching gears from milk to trout so this cd makes for an interesting period piece."
5,no Psychadellic Bromo Selzter on herre!,"I was attending Art School when this originally came out. I thought Beefheart was the coolest thing happening at the time. I also saw and heard him live around that time (about'71). It was a fleeting moment in musicsoon his music changed radically a couple of times and then it was gone. The group lineups changed quite a bit along with the sound. I think this was earlier material released a couple of years later, and this band wasgone, except John""Drumbo"" French. If you are a Beefheart fan you will probably want to have this in your collection, although some of the cuts are on Strickly Personal they are different recordings, some are extended alsoan overall darker sound. Beefheart complained that Strickly Personal had ""Psychadellic Bromo Selzter"" added without his consent."

1,Poor service,"I purchased this card because the Linksys web site said this card (PCM200) worked in both 16-bit and 32-bit slots. It does not. I sent them email about the incorrect page and told them that, because of the error, I have to pay to ship the card back to Amazon. A person from Linksys replied with a two-word email: ""Thank You."" I'm not looking for perfection, but courtesy would not seem too much to expect.They have now updated the web page to say that a 32-bit slot is required. I'm giving the card one star based on the fact that it didn't perform as originally advertised."
3,"Good product, painful installation","The Linksys PCM200 is a good card. However, users with SystemSoft on their laptops should read the extra installation steps required to install the card available from Linksys' Knowledge Base.I'm running a Pentium 233 MHz with Win95b and SystemSoft (a 3rd party utility for managing PCMCIA cards). Before successfully installing the card, the PC would not recognize the drivers and crash. Customer Support (although helpful), could not rectify the situation. I stumbled on the KB article and it solved everything."
3,It was pretty good,"I thought it was a good show but could've been exceptional. Still, it had some twists and turns and provided a unique take on the ghost/zombie genre."
5,Fantastic Show,Its short but well worth the watch. If you are a fan of Sci-fi shows you will enjoy this and might just watch it in one go.
2,As Exciting as Watching Dryers at the Laundromat,"Heavy on the atmosphere, but fatally light on plot. This is a slow, boring trudge through a bunch of dark, abandoned buildings and a few thickets. They must've blown the budget on a makeup artist and a cameraman, because they certainly didn't invest in writers."
4,Really Enjoyed it,I really enjoyed the show - it kept me watching. A bit different than I expected. I just don't know why he always wore the same pants!
5,good British sitcom,I don't want to give away too much of the plot. But I'm starting to appreciate British humor sitcoms. I am a fan of this show but I don't think there will be more seasons.
2,No Favorite.,I couldn't get through a full episode of this series. Too much sci- fi and not enough story line for me. Not even good sci- fi either.
1,This review is of the Blu ray,This is possible the worst Blu ray movie I have ever seen. Unless I have a defected disc. It appears as if the Blu ray was copied from a computer by way of a DVD. The blacks flicker through out the disc. Has anyone else had this problem? Please let me know if this is part of the movie...created by the film maker. Horrorible blu ray quality! Will be returning ASAP. The show looks good through. Will have to wait for it on tv. I did find a solution. Playing this in 3d cuts down on the flickering and it looks alot better.
5,Great Show!,"I heard this show was a good watch on a spill.com review, so I checked it out and after watching the series I fell in love with it. Filled with Young British talent, it's a pretty great little supernatural-comedy. It's surprisingly dark and for once a T.V. show is not afraid to kill off characters. Well worth a watch and even if it doesn't get a second season, it is still worth the watch. CHECK IT OUT!"
2,slow-paced and vague,"I watched a couple of the first episodes as exercise videos just out of curiosity. I wasn't engaged enough to continue. The storyline takes forever to get off the ground and the episodes are very slow paced and rather confusing. I had no idea where the series was headed or what was going on, so I don't have any investment in watching more. Characters have already died but I can't care because I don't have a clue who they were and whether they're good guys or bad guys. I'd have to characterize this show as just ""faded,"" like an old photo left out in the sun."
5,Great show even if the network didn't follow through,"I started watching after I already knew BBC3 failed to renew it for a second season. Since I'm in the US and like British TV, I tend to see things a bit late. But I watched anyway. Brilliant show even on a single season. And all this time later I still think about the show periodically. Am I the demographic target audience? No, I'm a middle aged woman from the US. And I still liked not being bored with a series for a change. A good bit outside the box, this was, and all the better for it. Go ahead and dive in."
3,Tried this show based on other reviews...,Tried this show based on other reviews... I didn't like it but I will not provide a lower than average review. It just wasn't my style.
5,works great,Mold works great and pops out very easy. I used this often and love the hearts. Great find and buy
2,OVERPRICED!!!!!! Very elementary,"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK AND THEN START DAYTRADING!! While this book explains what daytrading is and some basic points about the trade, it does not, REPEAT...DOES NOT explain what will be displayed on Level 2 screen and how to interpret market maker moves..THIS IS CRITICAL or you will lose a lot of money fast.. I read Nassar's book and Friedfertag's first book first and the market maker movement is explained pretty well in both of them. None of this is detailed in this book. The information is good but not nearly sufficient to start trading....thus the book is priced about twice what it should be."
1,Disappointing,"This book seems to be outline for a course rather that an informative book. I found the structure and depth of the information presented to be weak. I would suggest Tony Oz's ""Stock Trading Wizard"" as a more thorough treatment of NASDAQ Level II."
1,Not worth the money,"i am starting as on OTC trader on Wall Street, and this book is absolutely juvenile. What the book had to offer was not even basic, and pointless... For example, in reading the level II screen section, they tell you to watch Goldman Sachs (GSCO), but to be careful, due to the fact the the GSCO market maker knows that many traders watch. And that basically summed up the Level II analysis. Bottom line, buy something else, ANYTHING else..."
2,Poorly Edited Not much new or helpful information,I have no real problem with the fact that this book reads as if it were writted by a high school student who failed grammer and english. And was printed in my garage. I found the Underground Level 2 book very helpful and worth the very high price and it had many of these same problems. However this book does not redeem itself with useful info. I do not think that anyone but thos with very little knowledge of day trading and level 2 would get much out of this book and even those who would there are better choices out there
1,"Current information, but poorly written and lacking details","The information in this book is fairly current, possibly due to its December 1998 copyright, however I found its content to be poorly written and lacking in detail. The book is full of poor grammar, misspellings and wrong words. In many cases it seems that no one bothered to proofread the text. The book covers many topics, though very few were explained in enough detail to be meaningful. As a professional futures and options trader for the past seven years, I think that this book shows good potential, however in its current form I would not recommend it."
4,cute,cute but kind of long (the medium) have to watch your pup when they go potty or you will have a mess
4,Does the job.,"It works with the latest Canon ETTL II like 60D, 5 D II, 7D, etc. The exp accuracy is good."
2,Entertaining but very weird,"Phil Jackson groupie and sometime ESPN.com writer Charley Rosen turns in a fun, but sometimes off-putting fictionalized account of minor league basketball life. He develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot. However, Rosen's personal oddities drag the book down. Rosen is absolutely obsessed with bodily functions and he repeatedly goes into way too much detail about farting, urination, defacation, etc. At times, the book reads like an immature third grader's delight. My roommates and I all read it and the general consensus was that the book was enjoyable, but Charley Rosen is a really weird guy."
3,Could have been better.,This product seemed to lose some of its flavor after awhile. I used it infrequently in baking. It didn't have as much zing that I initially expected.
5,Crystalized Ginger is better than candy!,The crystalized ginger was wonderful! Ginger helps with digestion and this product is perfect. Fast shipping and no problems. Would by from again. Thanks so much
3,"Good, not great","I found about 10 or 15 recipes that I would actually use, and have tried a few and they were very good. Maybe that is par for the course with cookbooks , and considering the reasonable cost I'm not complaining. I'm happy to find some interesting, low carb recipes, for a slow cooker."
3,Slow cooker recipies,I guess I expected more from the title. Haven't as of yet linked into any great recipes in the book
4,Excellent Companion Volume,"This is a great addition to the Carpender Low Carb Library. I have been trying to adapt slow cooker recipes for awhile and never really mastered it. After trying just 3 of Dana's recipes, I see she obviously has. The Simple Meatloaf is superb. Enjoy!"
1,oh my gosh this is horrible,"i gave it the benifit of the doubt after reading all the reviews and oh gosh what a waste of money! it was absolutly horrible, what a waste of paper"
1,This Book Sounds Like A Real Artery Clogger!,"The five-star reviews sound like biased raves from members of the Dana Carpender Fan Club, while other reviews helpfully warn that many of the recipes, while low-carb, use lots of butter and beef, which make them high cholesterol meaning they're most definitely NOT for me! Sounds like it's a cookbook for the Atkins crowd. (Does anyone even DO Atkins anymore?)"
2,Not too pleased,"I have prepared 3 recipes from this book, and have not liked a single one. I am a pretty good cook, and can't imagine what I did that may have messed the recipes up. I will try a few more, but at this time I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,slowcooker,The book arrived quick. I haven't had a chance to try out any of the recipes yet. my only complaint is that you need a lot of special ingredients that are hard to find...
2,Disappointing,I tried two recipes and I didn't like the taste of the meals. It had nothing to do with the technicalities of the recipe but it is the style of food - it was stodgey and tasted like canned food.
1,3 Strikes your Out,"I don't usually write reviews, but had to speak out about this book. I I really enjoy using my slow cooker (and use it a lot) and was very excited to try the recipes in this book. I made 3 recipes from this book, the kashmir lamb, the chicken in coconut milk and Hot Asian Pork Ribs. Not one of the recipes turned out well enough to say I would make them again. The taste just wasn't there in these recipes. The descriptions on how good they were was way off in my opinion. Word of warning on the lamp shanks, they smell awful when cooking on low which I was not aware of. We ended up throwing the whole dinner out because of the smell alone."
1,Way too many calories for weight loss,"Big mistake to purchase this book if you are trying to lose weight on the low glycemic diet. Calories have to be counted as well as carbs and the ""normal"" calorie range per meal is (for example) 595 to 983. I noticed based on that, I will use very few of these recipes and will most likely resell the book."
4,Still trying them out,I would give this a five star review but I am still trying out the recipes and I am not sure about all of them.The only downside is that she includes some repeats from previous books since I have the others I feel they are redundant but since they are great recipes I accept it.If you need to have low carb foods ready in a hurry then this is NOT for you but for slow cooker use all that I have tried have worked beautifully and don't require an inordinate ammount of preparation time.
3,Made out of plastic and not all metal!,"I have a ""Off the Wall"" narrow guitar hanger I bought years ago that I really love, it is 100% metal, it cost more than the other brands but I felt I got a good deal because it was metal and would last forever. The item I received was molded plastic, heavy gauge plastic but plastic none the less. This is really a great hanger, but it should be cheaper now that they are plastic, $19.99 is a lot for a piece of rubber covered plastic and three dry wall screws. The hanger seems to be just as functional as the metal one, I am just disappointed it is plastic and was so expensive."
2,painful to finish,This is the 2nd Heck book I read. The Connecticut Yankee in Criminal Court was decent around a 4 star. However this book dragged . The characters were bland and I found myself skimming just to find out the ending. I am going to hold off reading any more of his work.
4,"Great show, some minor technical glitches","I'm not saying anything new, but the dubbed version will drop to the Japanese version on occasion, usually at the beginning or end of an episode. I prefer the Japanese version, but I enjoy the subtitled version as well, the voice-over actors doing a superb job-it's like getting twice the content. There are inconsistancy problems with the printed titles and the on-screen titles, but they don't cause any real confusion. I found the quality to be very good over all. Another point is that there were no collectable cards included, no big deal for me, but if you're a card freak and that is why you are buying this-be forewarned. If you have any interest in Ultraman you need this set, technically it's not crafted perfectly, but to see these again after almost 40 years is a real treat."
1,THE BOTTOM LINE,"The Bottom Line is...This is worse than the Sandy Frank versions of the Gamera movies thatplayed on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. Now, you can't deny that that's true."
2,AN INSULT TO THE HERO,"Ultraman has finally been defeated. Not by the Zeton. But by poor audio/video presentation. I cannot believe this is a ligit release. Don't be fooledby the attractive box. This is a bottom of the barrol bootleg disc. Home made R-DVD's look better, and I couldn't get a disk to sound this bad if I tried to do it on purpose. Avoid Volume 2 like the plague. I can't believe Tsuburaya would do this to us.Is the english track missing or just defective?Why is the video so jumpy/artifacted ?Are these episodes ""Time compressed""?if I turn the english subtitles off, they will pop back on again sometimes. Why?Did the show always look/sound like this? (I was pretty young, not sure.)And Alex P's explanation is wrong. Most of the scenes presented only in japanese were definately intact in the original english versions."
1,"""Never looked Better""? Are you guys high?","The quality of this video stinks.I have thousands of DVDs and this is easily the worst. Remember that this is ""supposed"" to be a ligitimate release. It's not a fly by night company or R-DVD distributor like Beverly Wilshire. Tell me where you have ever seen a ligitimate company put out videos that flicker like this and have this much audio noise. The movement should be smooth.This is truly a first. Perhaps BCI should be given a special trophy for being the first at something.Incidently, I do not want to watch this in Japanese, because that is not the way I grew up with this show. Its the same reason I do not watch Lost In Space in french, or Speed Racer in Yiddish. I know Ultraman comes from Japan, but I do not speak Japanese.My god. THE END IS NEAR. It must be a sign. Congradulations BCI. You win a ""No Prize""."
1,"Awful DVD, Bad Presentation!!","This Dvd is the worst quality I have ever encountered. End of story.Why also, are all the bad reviews that panned this disk dissapearing from this site and being replaced with good ones. My first review and several others that agreed with me have been pulled.I wonder why that is?"
2,Very bad quality gives Japan SciFi a bad name!!!!!!,"Poor domestic releases like this are what gives japanese science fiction a bad name in america. Think about it people.Releasing a Dvd of this quality will have everyone in america, especially those too young to have seen this series in the 1970s, thinking that Ultraman always looked cheap.Is this really how you want people to think of Ultraman in the west."
4,Finally!,"Although I have not watched the entire DVD set, I am very happy with it so far. Unlike some reviews posted I think this release is great! The picture quality is very good. I noticed one spot where the english dub dropped out and the Japanese dialog kicked in. Perhaps I am not as picky as some ultimate fans out there. This set brings back a lot of good memories for me. Hopefully Johnny Sokko will be next in line."
5,Review of the DVDs,"If I could I'd give this 4 1/2 stars I'd do so to the sound quality (hiss, etc.) of the English dub and the missing sections of English that have been explained in an earlier post. Having mentioned that the picture quality is pretty decent for a 40 year old Japanese TV show. The packaging is nice with an episode synposis and a list of appearing Kaiju (monsters). If you grew up with Ultraman like me, this is a must own for you and something to share with the kids!"
3,ESTUPENDA SERIE PERO...,ESTA SERIE ES FANTASTICA Y ENTRETENIDA. PERO SU DOBLAJE EN INGLES ES PESIMO. UNA PENA QUE NUNCA PIENSEN EN EL MERCADO HISPANOABLANTE. EN ESPAÑOL ES MUCHO MEJOR; COMO CUANDO LA TRANSMITIAN EN TELEVISION EN LOS 70 EN PUERTO RICO.
3,"I LOVE Ultraman, but this DVD... not so much","Like many of the other reviewers, I grew up watching UM. Fans have been waiting far too long for a U.S. DVD release of this series to be let down like this. The episodes are all there. They look and sound ""fine"" for a low-budget, unpreserved, 40-year old TV series (could be better, could be worse). However, my real gripe is that the dialogue switches from the English dub to the original Japanese for no reason during certain episodes. I have these shows on video and the English dub is constant throughout, so this is an obvious, irritating and inexcusable oversight by the manufacturer.Nice job, BCI. Now FIX IT!"
1,"i like Ultraman very much, but the quality of this set is just BAD!","on a crappy TV, you might not be able to notice the horrible video quality of this set. but on a new world TV it looks really bad. i dont know why that is, but it's true. i've returned 5 copies to my local shop and each one had the same issues: tons of pixelation and squiggly lines when ever there is the least bit of motion on the screen. this has nothing to do with the original video given to the company by the license holder (well, that's another story) but this problem is only because of extremely poor encoding by the manufacturer. this BCI company has a track record of releasing really horrible quality releases, and this is no exception, unfortunately. i give Ultraman 5 stars, but BCI zero stars for such a poor quality effort. i'm hoping BCI doesn't make the same mistakes with the next sets. otherwise it will crush them."
2,Really Bad DVD I'm really angry about this. Who do I blame?,"Couldn't wait to see this show again. Popped in the disc and discoverd its half in Japanese. Not the excelent dubbing I remember. (To those not familiar with the series{ Ultraman is a japanese program dubbed into english. The dubbing was, perhaps, the best dubbing ever done on an imported Japanese film.) When this DVD does have parts in english, the sound is very out of synch with the movie. Also, the sound IS very very bad. And I agree that I cannot hear a word that Peter Fernandes and company are saying. So even the extras are bad. The U.S. version opening credits were lifted from episode four of the Expresions In Animation VHS that came out in 1996. It also sounds awfulI, but on the original tape it sounded great. I have never purchased a video, imported or otherwise, as bad as this one. Never.Who do I blame?"
1,Bulls***,"This is only the first two disks of the show, and the packaging is garbage. I'll be more wary from now on when buying products from mill creek..."
4,Good quality,"The video quality is pretty good, and the show is better in the original Japanese with English subtitles."
4,Sound advice to read before investing your money,"This book is easy reading and presents a healthy perspective on how to think before investing. I think this book and Johnson's ""A Random Walk and Beyond"" are very helpful resources, especially compared to Lynch's pablum."
2,Lip Plumping pencil,Was not very happy with this product. The pencil was to soft and I felt it didnt do anything to my lips. Would not purchase again
1,Totally misleading,"This is basically a wide pencil lip liner in a nice, neutral color. However, the ""plumping"" is 100% non-existent... not briefly, not even with very wishful thinking. It's a ripoff and the price for no more than a plain lipliner is exorbitant."
3,Check first . . .,"I have been using the LipFusion color tint for quite a while and was eager to try the liner. I found that on me, this was quite drying. Therefore, I use it sparingly. What I like is that it lasts and fills in your lips beautifully. I use it whenever I'm going to a special event."
5,good product,"Good product, easy to use, stay in place for sever hours, my lips are soft, the look is natural but sofisticate."
2,lip pencil,Lip pencil seems drier than before and the color is a little off from previous pencil which I still have. Would not buy again as very disappointed.
3,"I don't like this line, but this color is OK",This is a nice rose and makes your lips look natural. That's all I can say about it. You won't get a glossy effect and the color fades quickly. What else is there to say?
2,Too Expensive and Too Lightly Pigmented,"I know this line is glorified in women's magazines but frankly I think it's hype. You will get softer, smoother lips but we're talking about the pencils.The color was blah, it doesn't go on well and I think the color choices aren't that great.I wouldn't buy the product again."
3,Won't work with iPod,"The card installs quickly right out of the box and Windows 2000recognized it without loading any other drivers.Unfortunately, the TI chipset used in these cards seems to havesome issues identifying the iPod player. The exact error messageis that the device failed to start and I get a Code 10 error.So, even though this may be a great card, I'm sending mine back"
1,Does not work with W98 SE either,"I have windowns 98SE. After I install this card,the computer will not shutdown. Doing shutdown, will onlycause the computer to reboot, have to unplug cord to power off."
1,worthless card - basically no tech support,I bought this card with the assumption that it would be no problem. However when I installed it Windows XP detects it as a PRINTER!! I ran through the hardware wizard over and over using different drivers recommended by D-Link with no success. I emailed D-Link for help and all they could tell me was to contact Microsoft. ... What a waste!
1,should be called firestarter card,"This card fried 2 motherboards - the first, after I tried to install it myself, and the second after the computer shop technician tried. The tech actually noticed smoke coming out of the computer. A call to D-Linktech support revealed (surprise) that ""our card doesn't do that."" My next call is to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Stay away from this product!"
3,"It works, I guess....","I got this in hopes of turning my PC and digital camcorder into a movie studio. It was easy enough to install I suppose, and it actually works I think because some images from my camcorder DID actually make it to the monitor. However, I was never able to do more than that with this product. I don't think there is something inherently wrong with it, but PCs, at least not highly up to date ones, are just not very compatible with Firewire. I guess I could have spent more time on this and perhaps actually accomplished something. It was just too tedious and not worth it. My brothers IMAC works brilliantly with Firewire, and I would recommend you get a Mac if you want to make movies."
3,"It was pure [baloney], but I kinda liked it...","The plot was tired, but the acting was ok especially Ja Rule who seemed a natural to his role. Not a bad first outing Ja.Pras co-produced and I think he should stick to doing that. His character just seemed too disinterested, or perhaps it was just Pras.Props to Robert Adetuyi for writing and directing - Jolly good show mah men, but did the editing kill the flow?Keep up the work guys, hey everyone's a critic..."
3,TURN IT UP,"I GOOFED WHEN ORDERING THIS MOVIE, THINKING I WAS ORDERING A DIFFERENT ONE.IT WAS OK. NOT MY KIND OF MOVIE BUT MY SON LOVED IT"
1,Good God! What is this ...? Needs a zero star!,I gave it a chance and not suprisingly I was thoroughly sickened. This is one of the latest in a crop of Hip Hop crime dramas featuring the same horrible rappers that fuel the ... soundtracks in the acting roles. This movie left a foul taste in my mouth and quite a headache. This is further proof that Rap is ruining all forms of entertainment. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this incorrigible trash. Word Yo!
3,full effective,Product is not sutiable for minors but very interesitng for people who are into this genre
4,Crescent fresh...,"This album...umm...don't know quite what to say. These guys aren't really a band, per se, but they kick a$$ all the same. Perfect fun stuff, good music to play in a situation where not everybody's into emo/punk/blah blah blah, you know.just buy it. you (probably) won't be disappointed."
5,Diggin It,"I like how they can combine emo, hardcore and a little bit of techno all in one album... its great to finally have something that everyone and their mom can enjoy and listen to in peace!!!"
5,IN F-IN FULL EFFECT... yeah....,"Where to start. The demise of coalesce was a loss, but the gain of Reggie and the Full Effect was well worth it. This is the side project of James Deweez, former coalesce drummer and current keyboardist for the Get Up Kids, and he proves his talent extends far beyond those bands. Fun pop rock songs, skits, and break-beats is what Reggie is known for. Greatest Hits 84-87 is definatly one of my top 10 albums of all time."
4,"good product, but was out of date","This is an excellent face wash and the product shipped quickly. However, the company uses expiration dates and the product I received was about 2 months out of date."
4,"What it lacks, makes up for with suspense","I only have one problem with this author's writing. The romantic dialog seems forced and very fake. The suspense, the story line and every other aspect of the book is wonderfully written, but she has not quite mastered how to create sexual tension with her main characters to where it builds into something more. I also think they need to show more feeling to why they might be falling in love. It just seems unrealistic. Other than that little detail, the book was very good and I look forward to reading more of her works."
2,A Legal Thriller. Not Romantic Suspense like stated.,You will not like this book if you are looking for a romantic suspense novel. This book had little/none romance in it. The characters were unrealistic. The dating was unrealistic. The book didn't get interesting until page 200. So don't bother reading it. Or just read the back cover then start at page 200. The book will be a not more enjoyable.
1,The Investigaor's Little Black Book 3,"Overall I was not impressed. Information on the majority of subjects covered, is readily available in either the phone book, dial-up directory, or by doing a simple internet search. It appears the author is trying to turn a subject worthy of a pamphlet into a novel. With each turn of the page I felt more the chump for having purchased this book. I am left to believe, the appendices must have been included for the benefit of the simple minded - so ""elementary my dear, Watson"" they are almost an insult. If a P.I. needs a book like this I probably wouldn't hire him. A recommendaton for Black Book 4 would be to include some of the ways P.I.'s really get information for their clients."
2,Waste of money,This book is basically a phone book. You can google any of these agencies yourself. Most of the data in this book is outdated too.
