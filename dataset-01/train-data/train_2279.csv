1,Not even worth one star,"This is the worst example of poor construction, quality and materials I have ever seen in a product that was priced this high. I am ashamed for Kodak - and I will never buy a digital camera from them again. I love my Kodak DC280 and I'm going to keep it now instead of trading it in. This camera shouldn't be priced [that high]- It felt like it was going to break as soon as I put it to use. It was returned the same day I received it."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"Kodak has some nerve charging so much for a camera that does so little. I have a 3 yr old 1 meg Kodak camera that takes much better photos than this 3 meg. The photos are not crisp by any means. I expected a little more by stepping up 2 megs.Once I got over the fact that the 3900 didn't come with a rechargeable battery, I was irate by the fact that it doesn't come with streaming video like the much less expensive 3600. The 3900 is much more expensive than the 3600, yet the 3600 has more features. I compared both and the 3600 even takes better pictures with only 2 megs. Don't make my mistake. Stay away from this camera!!!"
4,Good camera,"I am very happy with this camera. The pictures turn out great. I only have two complaints - one is there is no neck strap, just a wrist strap and two, the batteries seem to drain quickly. If you get this camera, I'd suggest getting a larger memory card and the docking station. I leave it on my desk with the camera in it and my batteries are always charged. I also purchased a rapid charger from Kodak, which came with another set of batteries. Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera."
4,3900 converts film user,"My wife purchased teh 3900 for Christmas. I have used film cameras for the past 20 years including some very good SLR cameras. While not an expert, I take the hobby seriously and was skeptical of digital cameras.This has changed with the 3900. The photo resolution is excellent. I took a photo of my daughter's face from 10 feet. I was able to zoom in on teh face and did not get any grainy lines until I was looking at her eye lashes.The system is very easy to learn and use. The only thing I do not like is its light weight . . . I keep thinking I will break it if handled roughly.The software package is easy to use from my 2-year old DELL. Printing with a new CANON printer at 8x10 yields excellent photos."
1,very poor after service,"I have had this camera for about a year now--and suddenly the LCD screen that shows the pictures went blank.I tried calling kodak help--but only after multiple attempts was I able to speak to a live person--who quite frankly said ""it will cost you $150 to even get it looked at--you are better off buying a new one""!!I for one, did not shell out all that money on a camera that goes dead in 14 months.I will buy another camera--only it will definetly not be Kodak.very .... off."
3,Good Camara,This camera is really easy to use. It takes clear pictures with great detail when seen on the screen. It is not heavy and it has a perfect size to travel with. The software is great and easy to use too. The only problem is that when you print the pictures all the quality is gone. So this is a great camera but not if you primary use of it is to print the photos.
2,why is everything so red,"SO I have had this camera for a year and anything that has red in it is intensified, people look like drunks with splotchness and when I use it for work the products look much redder that they really are. The only way, I have found to get rid of it is to use ACDC to modify the photos what a time consuming affair. Other than that it is really simple to use."
5,Can't Get Better Pictures Any Easier!,"Great Camera! This is my first digital camera - I am very impressed. I was taking pictures right out of the box, without needing to read the manual. The menus are easy, intuitive and nice to look at. I did purchase the docking station along with it. It is great one touch and the photos are uploaded in seconds (along with easy battery charging). The pictures look great and print great.It would have been nice if it was packaged with a larger CF than 8mb. But that is my only complaint. I highly recommend this camera."
5,Fabulous digital camera!,"This is my first digital camera and it's wonderful. The picture quality is much better than I expected, definitely worth going with the 3 mega-pixel. Fine details are excellent. I did not bother to spend the extra money on the camera dock and I am glad I didn't. The USB connection is extremely simple to use. I did purchase the Viking 128mb flash card which will hold 126 non-compressed or 260 compressed pics. Definitely better than the 8mb card it comes with (which only holds 8-15 pics). This camera also has enough extra features that you won't feel cheated or the need to immediately upgrade once you've gotten the hang of using the camera. I was actually surprised at how many extras the camera did come with. The software was average, but does make transfering your pictures extremely easy.I absolutely feel I got my moneys worth."
4,"Great Value, compact, and easy to use.","For average home use this camera is great. It is compact, and super easy to use. However if you want a camera that will give crystal clear vibrant images you will need to get something a little more high end. Check out Kodak's sample images, to get an idea of the quality."
5,Quit screwin' around and take the picture!,"Thirty years ago, when I was in the service, I bought a 35mm SLR with all the bells and whistles. I spent a ton of money (for an enlisted man) on lenses, filters and other accessories. I would spend several minutes before every shot setting the f-stop, shutter speed, zoom and focus. I thought that was how photography was supposed to be done. When I was a child, I thought as a child...now as an adult, I just want the picture. This camera has the option of setting film speed, f-stop, zoom, etc., or, as I prefer, point and click. It's the Macintosh of digital cameras. The quality of pictures is excellent. And really, isn't that what you want? I got the docking station, extra memory and an extra battery. It sets up great for vacation. We can recharge the batteries at night and the extra 256 MB flash card holds all our pictures from vacation. This is a great camera ""for the masses."""
4,Everything I need,"Fantastic pictures, 3.1 megapixel comes out HUGE on the computer with beautiful quality. Easy to use also, only beef is with the battery indicator system. Low battery is indicated after 100 shots, I think it might be a bad battery though."
3,"Good Camera, but short life of battery ruins the fun","Excellent Camera, but short life rechargable battery has ruined the fun of using this camera. The battery does not last 5 minutes after recharge, recharge & recharge. The green lite turns on right after two minutes charge. It was charged according to the menu. It is quite frastrate. I love the camera feature and easy to use. Without battery the camera is useless."
4,Excellent Choice,"We bought this camera about 6 months ago when our daughter was born and are thrilled with the pictures. We use Shutterfly.com to get prints and people can not believe that they were taken with digital. The dock is a great accessory and one of the reason I bought the camera. We do not have to worry about hooking up cables and charging batteries. Just drop it in the dock and you never have to worry about it. The one knock I do have against this camera is the battery life. I have a 64 MB CompactFlash card, which give me a total of about 64 pictures. At around 25 - 30 pictures that battery is nearly dead. So, just cary some extra batteries. Highly recommend for picture quality and easy of use."
1,Poor long term performance,"When I first got my Kodak DX3900 camera, I was pretty happy. Yes, the memory card is too small, but otherwise it seemed to have all of the features I was looking for. The first few photos looked pretty good as well. However, with continued use, the camera simply doesn't perform. After taking only about 30 photos, the camera now refuses to take any more photos, and those last few photos were out of focus and either over or under exposed. Changing batteries helps for a short while, but even using CRV3 lithium batteries rather than AA's, after a very short while the camera refusues to perform other than to let you see the few photos you've already taken. I'm not aware of other cameras that consume battery power like this, so my plan is to get rid of this camera and buy a new one soon."
1,The most boring cocktail party more like.,"I only bought this book because I read on the BBC that the Gallagher brothers from Oasis were thinking of doing a film based on the book, I paid $25 dollars for it as it was a collectors item and it was in my opinion a big waste of money. The book is badly written and very dull, my advice don't bother with this one."
4,"Please, Movies and Books are seperate media types and",thus should not be compared. The movie is always changed from the book to appeal to visual.The book makes you use your brain and thus you can create it the way you want.This is a fine read and it will raise questions that you can discuss with your book chums.The only thing to discuss about the movie: Was the skating scene waaaayyyy to long?
5,exquisite crafter of words..,"Barbara Brown Taylor is the kind of preacher that those of us who are, would like to be. The book is dedicated to her mentor, Fred Craddock, who is also- like her- a poet first, and then a preacher. Taylor helps her listeners to anticipate, then embrace, God's silence, rather than lament it. She helps us all to understand that silence in such a way that we know we are looking over her shoulder, as she seeks to understand it herself.As long as God has Taylor, God is not silent.."
4,Powerful,"A powerful collection of three sermons directed at current and future pastors, Taylor discusses the role of a pastor in the church and society. She accurately describes the hot oil feeling of interpreting the Word of God for receptive and unreceptive ears. And she details the awkwardness of that relationship when the pastor feels the well of communication has dried. A must read for anyone who preaches or seeks a conversational relationship with God."
5,Well Researched and Presented,"Dr Taylor has obviously done her 'homework' and presented a well researched subject. It is a matter of interest to academia, clergy and laypersons alike. She writes in an easily, readable style, that is readily understood. I've recommended it to several of my clergy friends; and, will recommend it to lay people as well."
2,not for the seasoned teacher,"I read where the book's length was exaggerated since the information was only printed on one side. I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Turns out the blank pages were as disappointing as advertised. Every once in a while there is something to make the seasoned teacher pause and think, however most of it leaves one wondering where on earth ""that"" would be acceptable, much less allowed.After reading through it, letting a colleague do the same, and then discussing it, it strikes me as something a university dust bunny wrote who has no concept of what does (or can) go on in a real school setting. It might be tempting for a newbie to invest in, but don't waste your time (or $). Go find the folks that have a good reputation for classroom management and reaching kids (does not mean the ones the kids like). Listen to them, copy what you can, steal the rest."
5,Sounds awesome,"This product is everything I expected. I installed it on my 2.0 Jetta and it sounds awesome, and the extra pick up feels great. it was easy to install too, the hard part was getting the old exhaust off. Awesome deal on an awesome product"
2,Save your money,"This book is a perfect example of an OK idea presented in a bad medium. Had the author chosen to make this a web site or a magazine article, I don't think anyone would object to the rudimentary information provided within. Instead, the author presents 100 ""hacks"" comprised entirely of overviews on quickly-dating shareware and freeware downloads, as well as step by step instructions on how to use the intrinsic Windows dialogs to change properties and settings. Little presented here could not be as easily discovered by Googling ""Windows XP tips tricks"", browsing popular computer magazines, or using the internal Help."
2,Lots of errors,"It seems like no one edited or tech edited this book. From the start, where he talks about putting 'huskies' (they are wolves) as his boot screen to the bootvis problem already discussed, to numerous other technical errors, this book is not up to snuff to the rest of the hacks books.I didn't even try half the registry hacks because if he can't get some very basic information right, am I certain I want to trust someone with more detailed, specific information?Very poorly edited, very poorly researched book, and not worth the price."
2,Won't improve your skills much,"I bought the book even after reading previous reviews. Oh well. If you have any knowledge of Windows and it's functionality and want to improve on those skills, this book won't do it. It's all about tools and utilities you can download or purchase, and how to use those programs. Not much insite into Windows built in tools and better ways of using them. I did think the host files and DNS section could be helpful, but as a previous poster said, you can find tips like that on the internet."
5,Serving Beirut While in Danger,This is a remarkable book depicting the reality of marines in combat areas. It flows easy for the reader to ride along and experience the good and the bad of military operations. The dialog is timely and intriguing with unexpected revelations and twists that makes it a wonderful work throughout. Excellent reading for anyone!
5,Command Picture Hanging Strips. White - 2 sets of 4,"3M Command, the mounting solution that holds on strongly, comes off cleanly! 3M's patented stretch release technology offers strong holding power and damage-free removal. The innovation - forget about nails, screws, tacks or messy adhesives that damage your walls. Revolutionary Command Adhesive works great on painted surfaces, wood, tile and more. Comes off cleanly leaving no holes, marks, sticky residue or stains"
4,"a little outdated, but the best i've seen for soccer basics","This is one of the best instructional soccer videos that I have seen and used. The way the instructor gradually builds you up to learning basic soccer skills is not only very effective, but fun. The instructor has a very likeable personality and style of teaching and at times can actually be funny. His eastern european accent and humorous, yet rigid manner, give him an almost ""Colonel Klink"" like quality that is fun to watch. This video will definately take kids and adults that have never touched a soccer ball, and get them up to speed real fast."
4,Very cool sound at a good price,Offcourse there's cooler distortion unit out there (there's always something better somewhere)but for the price i think its a very good choice. Will definetly be keeping that one one my pedalboardfor a while.
5,Best distortion ever,This is the best sounding distortion of them all. he few controls it has enables a very broad range of sound.
3,Sauce dishes,I thought these would be a little bigger. Size was hard to tell before ordering. This is just big enough for soy sauce or dressing on the side.
2,Foreign Castles built in the Faculty Lounge,"Bruce Cumming's long campaign against American ""imperialism"" has led him to embrace the Kim dynasty in North Korea. It is, afterall, the most virulent opponent of U.S. policy (though Iran is vying for that title, having more resources available to play at that game and weaker neighbors to bully). Like other academics during the Cold War and Maoist eras, Cummings had built foreign castles fit only to be viewed in the faculty lounge. He, of course, prefers to live in the United States where he can enjoy all the comforts offered as chair of the History Department at the University of Chicago. It is the wealth of ""imperialist"" states like ours that make career postions like his sustainable. Nothing like biting the hands that feed him!"
3,Informative but a bit emotional,This a good book to gather information and historical trends of the countries it talks about however I think the justifiably liberal point of view looses a little creditability because it gets emotional at times- sort of like it is trying to persuade me too much. I can do without the slights and overly slanted remarks. Facts reflect fact: you don't have to spin up the truth too much to get your point across. I like the book but it makes me think the author(s) might have been insiders or closely related to but for some reason now have sharp teeth and snarls about the subject.
5,Political and Manly adventure,"I was introduced to this book by my brother, but I originally didn't want to read it. I thought it would be dull, and as some other non-fiction books I've read: boring. However, from the very first page the book captivated me. I found myself constantly wanting to return from my daily activities, and dive right back in. The author and Lt. Blenko themselves bring communist life to the front stage and put a face on it.This would be an excellent book for anyone looking for a quick manly adventure story, whether adult or youth, male or female, and would be a wonderful gift for any left-wing extremist trying to pervert society with communist ideals."
4,Entertaining but tragic history,"The violence in this book is so appalling that it becomes almost amusing after a while.There is far more emphasis on violence than on culture. Some of the anecdotes are interesting, and nearly mythical in their dimensions, particularly the ones occurring in the 14th century--but also the stories surrounding at least two 20th Century political assassinations, stories surrounding the figure of Ali Pasha(and of the legendary Albanians who would not submit to his rule), the incredible brutality of the Turks against the Greek Orthodox Church in Constantinople during the Greek Independence Rebellion,and also against the Armenians, the story of the occupation of Constantinople during the 4th Crusade, and the like. One regularly encounters decapitations, genocide, highway banditry, and irregular armies in this book. There is also some extensive discussion of the role of Europe (and Russia) in diplomatically resolving the conflicts in the region."
4,"Good, but","I can always judge how good a book is by how fast I read it. So, it gets four stars. I read it pretty fast, but not 5-star fast... I don't agree with the people that commented that the book was disjointed. Though at times the author digresses to future time periods, these digressions are always relevant to the time periods discussed.I learned a lot from this book about the Balkan/Ottoman history. It's not extremely extremely detailed, which was good for an introductory Balkan reader.What I was disappointed in was, for the description of the 1912-1913 Balkan wars, the author really needed to provide maps. He went into some detail in the army troop movements, naming cities and areas that I have no idea where they were."
3,Lost In The End,"The book does a good job of going over the Southern Balkans conflict with the Ottoman Empire from the Greek perspective. For 500 years the author gives us a good general overview. This is for most of the book. Suddenly he goes into great detail in the the short second to last chapter about the ""First"" and ""Second Balkan Wars"". The level of detail in this chapter does not match the previous chapters. In the last chapter he skips to a few thoughts on the conflict in the 90s but offers us only a few pages. Missing entirely is the WWII and Tito's arrival on the scene. 50% of the photos depict the damage caused by NATO in the 1999 conflict over Kosovo. No photos of what the Serbs did to the Albanians are shown. Considering that only a few pages of the book were dedicated to the 1999 conflict, why so many photos and why so one sided?"
4,Good quality piece of furniture,This piece is well constructed and worth the money. It's beautiful and my wife likes it.
4,Dual Mag Holster,"Well I'll start it out by saying love em..Fits my mags perfectly..There double stack Px4 .40S&W; 14 rounds..Easy to adjust tension..Keeps em in nice in tight but easy enough to pull out.Also I see some of the mag holsters out there you cant really set the mags both in the same direction,this one you can..No problem..That way it makes reloading super quick.Belt clip/Paddles a little tight but just needs some wearing in,plus its good to havve a tight fit.Good quality material doesnt seem cheap at all..A few speckles of speckled kydex(not perfect finish)But who cares..good price and best bang for your buck I'd say..Goes perfect with my Serpa Blackhawk CQC Holster"
5,"Good retention, easy to adjust","Bought these to carry 2 mags concealed. Magazines are nice and secure, but the holder is adjustable to allow you to tweak it just how you like it."
2,Dissapointed,Not how I really expected it. When I put it on for work it stays out a little it does not stay firm on my waist.
5,Great Game,"Awesome game. Highly recommended, though I kind of wish I'd gone with the single-DVD version of the box, rather than the multi-CD version."
3,Great Fun,[[ASIN:0761545174 Unreal Tournament 2004 You will have many great hours by yourself or playing online
3,Fun Game,"This is a little too futuristic for my taste, but my brother and I play it online and it's fun for that. It makes me miss 007 Golden Eye on N64."
2,UnrealTournament 2004,"Was too short for this type of game. Had issues with gameplay and not as good as GOTY or original in regards to being able to recognize the opponents. Hard to figure out what you're supposed to be doing at times and where you need to be. Opponents seem to be able to shoot you from a very long distance even when they aren't visible. Took away from enjoyment because of those problems. Control and friendly A.I. were also at times an issue. Seems someone forgot to relive the first ones before making this one. I don't play online because of cheats. Maybe it's better, i don't know."
2,Why so expensive?,There are lots of other crib mirrors on the market that cost much less. This one does not play music or have attachable toys. ...
4,Great Crib Mirror,"My son loves this mirror. He used to HATE tummy time, but now he loves to look at himself in the mirror. I swear he's absolutely vain about it. The only things I don't like about it are that it doesn't tie to the crib on the bottom, so he can lift it (he likes to chew on the corners). This corner chewing would be fine, but you can't take the plastic mirror out and put the cloth frame in the washing machine. The mirror also scratches easily. But these aren't really any big deal, and overall we're really happy with it."
3,this mirror is sooooooo cool !,this mirror is very cool because when your baby dosent know to look into a mirror they can look at the black and white picture on the back! those are the first colors they see also this mirror is cool to use in the carDirections:if you have an infant seat facing backwards slip it in the crack in between the carseat and the seat then your baby will be happy the whole ride!
3,Erotic and full of vampirism,"Embrace the Darkness 2 is nothing like the dvd cover, because the sex scenes are not explicit nor constant. There are at least 5 of them. Also the rated version has more of a plot, unlike the unrated, because the unrated features more sex scenes. Overall, the film is worth watching for people who like erotic horror."
4,PLEASE BITE ME,"More soft core erotica than horror, this is an excellent addition to the soft core genre. Attractive young woman submits to vampyrism and then has troubles with her boyfriend as you might expect.It's well produced and moderately well acted."
5,The Best Erotic-Vampire Film,"Quite simply the best erotic-vampire film ever (if you're wondering about what I mean by erotic-vampire... think the Vampire Lovers, Erotic Rites of Countes Dracula etc, ...), only this film's much better.This film manages to truly capture the eroticism that comes from a vampire film."
4,"Niu, Airframe Structural Design, 2nd Ed. - Review","Micahael Niu has filled a void that has existed since E.F. Bruhn last published his book thirty years ago. I recommend all of Niu's books, and this one is no exception. It is full of design details and recommendations that are difficult if not impossible to obtain without extensive experience in many companies. It is a book to be studied, however, not simply glanced at. The practicing designer should do well to periodically re-visit this book before undertaking a new assignment.Unlike his other books on stress analysis, this is a design reference only, with few examples of calculations that provide further insight into the reasons for the design recommendations provided. It is thus a complementary book, and a good addition to any aircraft reference library."
4,Airframe Structural Design,This book cover all aspects of airframe design with materials data for stress analysis. Should be on your book sshelf.
1,Absolutely Useless,"Poorly organized, without any useful details. Provides only the most basic overview. Wast of money in my opinion.*I'm an aerospace engineering student who purchased this book to work on the structural design of my senior project. Not once was it useful. I ended up using a number of other textbooks including Corke, etc."
1,This book creates a vacuum,Used this book in structures I. Might be a fair reference....students.......don't bother with this one.
1,Not As Good As Sample Packets,"My mom wanted this product after her friend gave her a sample of it. After using it, she said it wasn't as good as what her friend gave her."
2,Not very good,"This book is just rehashed material from many resources, It offers litle insight into the requirements of serious cruisers. This book exists mainly to push the designers own plans. One would be better sticking to the Pardeys books for indepth information. Likewise Hal Roths books"
3,Concerns Operation.....,"I actually received one like this from a friend, that said it did him no good....I tried it, and ON FULL, it kept re-adjusting itself, and would then just cover one side..... NOW to fix this, I set the dial where I wanted it to go, which was on FULL.....then in that position, I SUPERGLUED IT !!!Low and behold, it surely works now, and I have not had a problem with it since......FULL is where I wanted it.....BRUCE"
1,Absolute garbage,"Defective product doesn't oscillate unless on full pressure. Giving it a kick helps to restart the action but why bother just dont buy it,."
4,Nice combo for the money,"I hoped the battery would work in my U620 phone, but the phone says it's not supported. The info in the product listing didn't say it would work, I just took a chance, since some batteries listed for the models in the product description also say they work on a U620. Just a heads up for anybody else thinking the battery might work.Even so, it was still a good deal just on the two chargers that came in the package, so I can't complain. :-)"
3,"If you liked ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil""","You may be interested in this as well. It was my mother's favorite book growing up in Savannah in the 1930s and has been out of print for years. She just gave me the new edition. The style is very overwrought and florid, and the story of a girl from the wrong side of the tracks must have been quite racy for its time. Still, it's an accurate picture of Savannah society at that time and entertaining in its own way."
3,A potboiler with great local color,"Harry Hervey was a screenwriter for such classic movies as ""The Road to Singapore"" and other ""Road"" films with Hope and Crosby. Though not born in Savannah, he did live here for a long time, eventually penning this page-turner in 1939. It's far from high art or great literature, but ""TDDC"" does provide a glimpse at a Savannah down on her luck in the middle of the 20th century. If you want to dive into the seamier side of Savannah's past, this is a great place to start!"
4,a southern classic,"I can't believe I am just finding out about this book. A true southern classic.For 1939, it's pretty raunchy and I imagine this book created quite a controversy when it came out."
3,Rare rockabilly remembered,"Bear Family is famous for reissues in clean format, and they gave the full treatment to this compilation of North Texas inspired oldies. This collection of 4 CDs goes from Red River Hillbilly, to a facsimile of Buddy recording in New Mexico. The full story of my father's struggle to find new sounds is given in a great biography. Check it out if you are a collector."
4,Rockabilly Retrospective,"If you long for a return to the pre-glitz simple days of rockabilly, country, western (before Country Western), swing and pop, this collection is the answer. In addition to the CDs there is a printed history with photos telling the story of LIN and KLIFF records, all covering the l950s through 1960s.The musical themes are traditional: love, heartbreak and infidelity, plus a sprinkling of humor and tenderness for your listening pleasure. If you are familiar with and appreciate this genre, no further explanation is necessary. Just order it!"
4,Grrrr....ids,I thought Todd Dominey's review of this book was pretty well on the mark. There is some new information in Jute's book that I haven't seen elsewhere and information on the subject of grids is not easy to find. At the University of New South Wales this book is popular enough to rate a three day loan period.
3,"mint condition , but unreadible disk from 1988","The book is from 1988, and the disk included is not working (degraded) It's not possible to read it let alone copy it onto a Cd. Pity. I wish I knew. Besides that the book came as promised, on time in a mint condition."
4,"Not thier best, but very good","I have always been a big fan of the stranglers through all thier phases. This release is somewhat more uptempo than the previous release-Feline and contains many great songs. ""Skin Deep"", ""No Mercy"", and ""Laughing"" rank up there amongst thier best songs. As with any stranglers release there are a few throwaways (""North Winds Blowing"", ""Souls"") but overall excellent record."
3,rachel rachel,i really chose this movie because of the area in which it was filmed the scenes were well done and of course the actors were supurbe the story line was ok but left something in the end unfinished..
1,Seriously dull and outdated,"As a director, Paul Newman was a great actor. Here, because he was a big star at the time, they gave him the keys to make this now-dated mid-60s dud, starring his wife. A lonely 35-year-old spinster virgin has sex with her high school classmate who is back in small town New England for some ""action."" She thinks she gets preggy, but she doesn't. The rest is a lot of interior dialogue and flashbacks. The pace is glacial, the writing dated and the subject matter, while somewhat risque for 1968 Hollywood, is endlessly dull by today's standards. The soundtrack is hokey. This actually won four Oscars at the time! Weird. This has not stood up well at all. You'll be fidgeting if you watch."
2,"Excellent actress, awful script.","The story line was extremely dark and dismal though the acting was wonderful. The premise and flashbacks of a seemingly dysfunctional childhood and a built-in funeral parlour in the childhood home was eccentric and depressing. I could appreciate Ms. Woodward's performance, but the story line was just too creepy."
4,A First Rate Directorial Debut,"This is a great 1968 movie, making a long overdue debut on DVD. It stars Joanne Woodward as a single schoolteacher living in a small town.The film mainly follows her interactions with the other people in town.Joanne Woodward is terrific in a performance that brought her a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Barbra Streisand and Katharine Hepburn, ultimately, ended up sharing the award for""Funny Girl""and ""The Lion In Winter"",respectively. The movie marked the first time Paul Newman, Ms. Woodward's husband, had directed a film. He was as accomplished behind the camera as he was in front of it.Mr. Newman also had a first rate actress with his wife. The whole film is a well acted character study,with Estelle Parsons also being a standout. With the loss of Paul Newman in September 2008, this movie is a reminder of what a talent he was. It's a quiet,thoughtful,well made movie that I enjoyed and I hope you will too. Drew Levan"
5,I am so in love with harp music.,"I recently took an interest in listening to harp music, and so I ordered this CD from amazon. I am so glad I did!!! This CD has such beautiful and heavenly music, such healing and peace. I am listening to this cd now on my job. I never knew the harp is such a powerful instrument."
4,The best 360 Words I Know (Grades K - 2),I enjoyed this book a lot and hope any one to have a interest in books should read it. wonderful book
1,Really bad,"Johnny Gruelle wrote some enjoyable Raggedy Ann and Andy stories. This is not one of them. The plot wanders. I don't have the book in front of me (I got rid of it), so I can't remember the details, but I seem to recall that Raggedy Ann and Andy set out to discover something related to a tree with golden rings on it at the beginning of the story, and then that part of the book is seemlingly forgotten by the author. There are two very similar villains -- one repents of his evil ways part way through the book, so Gruelle replaces him with a villain who acts pretty much the same. The illustrator (another Gruelle, not Johnny) actually illustrates one character two different ways. Really, this is one of the worst children's books I've ever read. Gruelle must have been tired of the series, and the editor didn't care enough to do his or her job. Skip it."
5,My definitive guide to GoLive,I learned about 10 new and immensely helpful things in my first night reviewing only a few chapters of this book. I think I have just skimmed the surface.I know this will be my definitive guide to using and plumbing the depths of GoLive 5. I don't hesitate to recommend it.
1,Not a book for novices,"I had developed a web site using HTML 3.2 and a text editor and had no problem. But after buying GoLive5 and this book I was ready to chuck it all and go back to my text editor. The book will not show you how to create a website using GoLive. It will explain what everything does, but it doesn't show you how to use it. I found myself referring to the GoLive online help to understand the book. I finally gave up and purchased the SAMS Teach Yourself Adobe GoLive 5. A much better book for the beginning user and half the price. An experienced web designer might find Real World GoLive a good choice, but be prepared to wade through a lot of stuff to find what you need to know."
2,A good lesson of humility,"Well I must say that I was disappointed by this book. Maybe I thought that I would gather some secret knowledge about secret masters of the white lodge. But curiousity with no real good intentions never go far. So I found nothing in this book that is really hepful for the seeker since what can we know of them except that it is presumption to think we can know something about them. So this book is of no utility for a true seeker on my point of view, but that's mine!"
1,Terrible Product,"I bought some red sleeves for the handles of my cookware. They look like they were made for toy hands and toy cookware. I have no idea what they would be used for in the real world. Unfortunately the cost of return shipping is greater than the value of the products, so I get to take this one on the chin. I have had significant problems with 3rd party sellers and Amazon. Buy with caution."
4,Very Peaceful and Unique.,"I heard some of these songs from Waterfires Providence,RI.This kind of music gives you an artistic, uplifting, and spiritual thoughts. Beatiful music. Tourists, if you are into the arts and music such as this go to the Waterfires events at Providence,RI. you'll be very glad you went and the people, music, food, ballroom dancing, and waterfire on the rivers are all great and should give you great memories enjoying the romantic fires setted close to you. Check out http://www.waterfire.org/ to see the Waterfire schedule. Thanks."
4,a change from the norm...,"i am a union Carpenter i have always worn the good old set of bags and one day i was just tired of pulling up my pants and always sweating at my hips...i looked into these bags and thought why not try them,,,heck i can always send them back,,so i purchased them and when they came i tried them on ,,,wow what a nice set of bags air flows around you and the weight is distributed evenly ,,,lots of room for adjustment ""Im 6'-3"" 285lbs "" i loaded them up with tool more than i will ever carry at one time and they felt good no problems . when bending over ""_ ss and elbows"" they stay in place.. lots of pockets and the bags detach for that fine trim work ...so far i love them,,oh by the way the guys have tried them on and all seem to like them,,short and tall ....Thanks"
2,Not thrilled,These were not at all what I expected. The only one I liked remotely is the red one. The other two were virtually useless. I have not been able to open anything at all with the blue one.
5,New Orleans Brassssssssss,"This is New Orleans music today. It's chock full of big brass, dixie land, swing, soul, funk, reggae, hip-hop all rolled up into something much more. Buy it and see how long you sit still!"
4,Great replacement speaker,"I bought this to replace the original speaker that came in my GK150MB amp. Everything fit just fine but I couldn't use the little 'stop' that presses the back of the magnet in place. Other than that, the sound is every bit as good as the original speaker provided. I'm very happy with the Eminence Bass Speaker."
2,wrote my heart,"I am one of the writters of poetry whose poem was to be published in 94"" Treasured Poems of America and although I have yet to find and purchase the book in a bookstore I know that if the other poets are as good as I like to think I am to be it is a terrific book of poetry ful of imagination love hurt and all we can give as our poetry is our heart. I feel that sparrowgrass should have provided the first copy to the poets for free as it was our work and dedication that gave them a book. As we all live through life we learn it is yet to come and prosper into greatness. I am looking forward to getting a copy and reading it to feel and read the hearts of the other poets as Im sure theyr great."
4,Passion of Christ,"Many a classical composer has brought us to walk along the via dolorosa. Here an ambient stylist successfully moves solitude and withrawal into his arrangements. A dense fog of gloom rules the realm of Good Friday. Light is pervasive but muted. Despondence and paranoia squeeze one another into layed tones of measured rhythms and unusual space. Impotent to help we stand beside the way of the cross. Tragically isolated souls. Robbins' task to translate the mood of events unfolding into ambient terms measures up wonderfully. This is not just music, but an active ambient force that moves us from station to station. This musical reference to an historical event carries a heavy sence of loss which pervades the CD."
3,Decent for the price,"I don't think it's bad for the price. The flashlight and the vacuum are a complete waste. The screwdriver, pliers, wirecutter and everything else work just fine. Some of the stuff seems a bit silly (the Q tips), the IC extractor (maybe I'm alone on this, but when was the last time you extracted an IC with one of these?)"
3,Very Cheap Tool Kit,"This is like a toy, I am very disappointed with the quality of this product. I like belkin but this is not what belkin used to be."
5,Wonderful adding to the series!,"The One-Night Wife is the fifth book on The O'Conells series. I was expecting this book because in the past ones Sean seemed like the forever bachelor, and I was wondering who would finally get his heart.The wait was worth it, beautiful Savannah won his heart. She made him think of marriage, settling down, and giving up gambling. However, it was not an easy ride. Savannah had a painful past and present. Her protector is a devious man who kept blackmailing her with her sister's wellfare.Sean was a victim, and the something that came near the end was almost to jaw dropping to read it. I loved it! The suspense was great, the love scenes were fabuluous, and the qarrels, Oh my God.I truly recommend it!"
1,Don't Be Deceived!,"This is not the item that it claims to be. It is a sham. This album is not a ""lost classic"" from 1967. If someone today set out to create a bona fide knockoff of 60's psych and was convincing about it, I would enjoy it. However, nothing about this record sounds as though it is of the psychedelic era. It is empty contemporary corporate hard rock. A flourish of sitar is not enough convince a psych fan. The melodies are garbage, none of the sounds even bother to approximate actual psychedelia, and the vocals are bar-band tough guy, which isn't very trippy. I was sorely disappointed when I bought this by accident when I was trying to aquire work by the 70's psych/folk/rock band Unicorn (who was sometimes produced by David Gilmour). Unfortunately, I did not do enough research into that band to find out what their albums looked like and were titled, and ended up with this insult to my sensibilities."
3,Basically a Primer,"If you are absolutely brand-new to process improvement (I was), this book will be useful for you. It will teach you the basics of Goal-Question-Measurement (GQM), how to get some visibility to your efforts, etc. However, its shelf-life is rather short, and it does not lend itself well as a reference.If you've been through a process improvement initiative before, or if you're in an organization that takes this kind of stuff mildly seriously already, most of this will be review and self-evident."
3,Embroidery on Paper Erica Fortgens,A very good buy with countless patterns to use and adapt. I have bought this several times for family and friends who are all very impressed.
3,"Better options available, but not a bad purchase","The 256MB 2.0 Jump/Flash Drive from Lexar Media certainly gets the job done, however I wouldn't advise spending more than $60 on it. It has no password protect feature, and, depending on how old the model you are looking at is, some don't even have a write-protect feature. This model comes with drivers that automatically download when you first plug it in, however formatting is not automatic, plus, you will have to download seperate drivers off the internet if you are a Windows 98 user. The supplied drivers take up a little more than 11MB, so the capacity of the drive is actually in the range of 244MB, but that should suit most people fine. It's not a bad item, but I advise you to look around before making your purchase."
1,ONLY 15 MINUTES,"This tape is ONLY 15 MINUTES of just general information. Very simplistic overview comments. NOT worth $1.33/minute for just general info. Instead, Read research books (or CDs) by Dr Sally Shaywitz."
1,do not buy,"OK, this seems like a homemade video. Audio sounds tinny, picture quality is poor, footage not current....with all the other great dvds out there, don't make the mistake I did and buy this video."
5,"It's better than that ""Onion"" book (I forget the name).","By the time I got to the Punic wars, I couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard."
5,Nice overview of the Syndicate's mystery series,"""The Secret of the Stratemeyer Syndicate"" starts with a good, if brief, overview of the Stratemeyer Syndicate and its founder, Edward Stratemeyer.It then moves on to examine in detail four mystery series created by the Syndicate: Ruth Fielding, the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and the Happy Hollisters.Of the four, the Ruth Fielding chapter is the most detailed but all contain valuable information on their respective series.There are a few minor factual errors, such as the author's claim that Edward wrote the early Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books, among other minor gaffs.Despite this, this book remains a valuable resource to researchers of the Syndicate and is a good read for fans of the series mentioned."
5,Revealing the Secrets of Stratemeyer's Success,"What a great book. I agree with the former review, a very nice overview of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, including the bulkwarks of children's series, The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. I enjoyed especially learbing about the series I knew less of such as their predecessors the Rover Boys and Ruth Fielding. Great stuff and I wish all the series were still in perpetual print. It is also a good introduction to the entire world of children's adventure fiction before and during the Pulp Era.I got this book for some literary research, but I would recommend this to anyone, researcher to common reader. Fun, informative, and interesting."
1,Too large for shaker,"The dice were VERY LARGE, and VERY HEAVY....no way could you put them in a shaker and roll dice!! I had to return them. I play Farkle and we need 6 dice for the game and these very large dice would never work."
4,oster glass replacement jar,Good quality. Product a little shorter but slightly wider than original. Compatible however with base. Happy with overall quality of product.
5,Good as new,Works great. I was glad I didn't have to buy a whole new blender just because I broke the jar.
5,Great product,"This glass jar works great. My last one chipped at the bottom so when I blended anything it started to pour out once it was liquefied. This jar fit perfect and got here quickly. The lid is white, so it didn't match the black bottom I had for my old jar, but it does the job."
4,good quality jar,"This is a good quality glass jar and I like it better than the square style that I had before. The plastic lid is a bit too flimsy, and if you're not careful you can end pushing the center piece through."
1,Never followed through,I have been waiting 16 days and 4 phone calls for a mailing label to mail my item in (a MP3 Player). I even offered to send it to the service center myself but was told that I could not do that . Today I called and the woman stated that no mailing label was ever ordered. What is going on?Annemarie Murphy
1,NEW Repeatedly Doesn't Honor Their Plan,"I've twice had a Samsung 50"" DLP HDTV into the designated local service center covered by a NEW extended service plan. Both times, NEW dragged their heels and balked at approving the parts and service that the local service center needed to repair the set. It took threats of small claims lawsuits against the seller(not Amazon) and NEW to get them to approve the repairs. The second time, the set was in the shop over a month before the repairs were finally approved. I would never again buy a service plan backed by NEW. I would give them 0 stars if it was possible."
2,Difficult to put together and falls apart easily,"I am not happy with this purchase. I got it them for about $50 each, and I guess I got what I paid for. They were extremely difficult to put together.I bought 4 of them and the foot rests of 3 have broken. The legs have become wobbly after 6 months and the white seats are easily stained."
3,The Tabernacle:Shadows of the Messiah,"This is a good book. I only gave it 3 stars because I have read others that I personally liked better. However, this is written well and is very informative. If you are interested in The Tabernacle I would recommend this book."
5,The Tabernacle: Shadows of the Messiah,"Easy to read and understand. Material flows easily making the book hard to put down. Very informative and shows how every part of the tabernacle had a prophetic, redemptive and typical significance. A treasure to own and study over and over again."
2,Very little support for views...,"I was very interested in this book before it arrived, but was very disappointed with the actual text. While the historical information is good and seems solid, the applied symbolism lacks support or back up of any kind. I finally set the book down after 3 chapters. Too many times I would find a statement like, ""...and this symbolizes XYZ in Christianity."" No back up, so scriptural support, not even a historical claim. Anyone can say, ""this means that.""This could be great with some attention to detail."
5,Very good condition,Wow...this book is in very good condition. I am so happy with it and it came on time ( even before) and I would recommend this seller
3,A staple of university history of Science courses,"Good introduction to the history of early modern science. Historiographically a little dated and therefore lacking in the thorough treatment of the broader social and political origins of science in this time period. Still, it is a classic."
1,Jammin's OK for Music But Not For Shredders,Lousy product. Consistently jams and is impossible to clear out. Tried disassembling but is very difficult. Would not recommend.
2,Boring and needlessly confusing,"I am taking a VB 5 college course at night, and this is the textbook. It is quite boring, and the explainations are terribly unclear. The professor must go over EVERY SINGLE item in the text and explain what the author is trying to convey. Save your money. Don't buy this book."
3,Its too hard. reading material is bland and boring.,This book is best for someone who really knows about programming. Not the average beginner like I am. I gave up trying to learn visual basic after I reading this book. Now I need to go buy visual basic for dummies! :..((
3,VERY VERY Basic book!!!!!,"Great book for someone who has NEVER programmed before. If this is not your FIRST programming book/class, you will be bored to death. Definately NOT a reference book at all. As the title says, ""An INTRODUCTION to Programming"". It is on the level of a person who has just bought a first computer and wants to become a programmer."
1,Okay for teachers but not that great for students.,"I have used this book for a year and have come to the conclusion that I need a different book.While the book does a good job at explanations, its layout is bad. If you want to look up a particular reference you will have to dig for it, even if you were just looking at it. I think this book would be better if the author considered making two books. One a work book, and the other a reference book. This way finding what your looking for would be easier and less frustrating."
1,Below Average,"I've used this book in my class and found it unclear, unconsistent, and it does NOT take you step-by-step through the process. The CD-Rom that is included is good enough for student use. The book also has a look to it that makes you want to sleep. Overall, this is a boring book."
1,This is not a new Mick Taylor studio album-don't buy,"What deception, this is Mick playing studio guitar for this Sasha guy. Bad songs and voice. The 2nd disk you can get elsewhere and is not the best Mick live you can find. Mick only has 2 true studio albums and they are great-""Mick Taylor"" and ""A Stones Throw"" get those or the live ""Stranger in this Town"" if you can find them."
1,"Disc 1 is TOTAL crap! Shattered is ""Shitdoobie""","The first disc is total garbage, one stones song and it's discofied. (Shattered is not the Stones classic but one of Sacha's butt wipes.) MT does play well though. Disc 2 is an OK sounding bootleg from '95 with 50's R&B; great Joe Houston siting in (vocals)on ""Sweet Home Chicago"". He plays his legendary tenor sax on other tunes. Hum is a little bothersome on this disc. Never heard of these guys-local LA guys. ""Coastin' Home"" was written and originally recorded by the late bluesman Gerry Groom (with MT). Disc 1 deserves 1 star for some of MT's leads, Disc 2 gets 3 and a half stars (loses 1 star for background noise). I hope Taylor finds a good lawyer and sues this Sachet bum for whatever this crap earns. Great to hear two legends and the unfortunately unknown Groom together live.Check out Joe Houston's recordings here on Amazon-mostly honkin' R&B; instros.Blows Crazy!"
4,Good book,Recommended reading to help idiots who actually believe in evolution. Easy to read and not sophisticated. This is a good book
3,Poor translation hurt unusual memior,Unfortunately the Russian translator constantly confused the words shell and mine and really had a poor grasp of grammar. On the positive side the author tells a reasonably detailed story even though he was 80 years old when he wrote it. I hoped for more details about infantry combats etc... but I enjoyed this book especially since so few written by Russian soldiers have shown up here.
2,Lots of Mistakes,"I agree with the reviewer who complained about errors & contradictions. Although this is a fun book, it does have some silly mistakes. For example, the authors claim on page 342 that, at 26,000 species, crustaceans are the largest class of arthropods. Well, everbody knows that insects are arthropods. At 900,000+ species, insects are the largest class of arthropods and crustaceans are but a small fraction. Encyclopedia of the Sea by Richard Ellis is far Better."
2,The Handy Ocean Answer Book,"Sections of this very simply written book are just STUFFED with misinformation and inaccuracies! I wrote to the publisher regarding the contradictory and incorrect information in the sections on birds....and was ignored. Some of the information in this little tome may be just fine...but, read with caution and double-check the facts because the mistakes, although significant, aren't obvious and a naive reader might be easily misled."
5,Recommended for readers of all ages.,"A 'handy answer book' by Thomas Svarney & Patricia Barnes-Svarney using question-and-answer formats normally reserved for younger audiences to great effectiveness for adult readers, Ocean Answer Book surveys beaches, fish discoveries, and ocean exploration programs alike and is packed with facts, presented in a lively format for leisure browsing."
4,Flow with the Floyd,"Sublime, refined rendition of some Pink Floyd classics. If you're a Floyd completist, and after a slight change in pace and style from the admittedly already perfect originals, check this out. You wont be disappointed. Shine on Rick!"
3,Good stuff though some doesnt convert to the format,"This is to my knowledge the best classical album of Pink Floyd. Though most fans of classical music wont be that impressed of it, it is great to here songs like ""time"" and ""nobodys home"" in classical. The cello on ""nobodys home"" is some of the best stuff on the album, as the emotional symphony feel of ""us and them."" The only complaint is that some songs really dont carry when converted to a classical format. ""another brick in the wall"" is basically a few lines repeated over and over again. Sometimes things dont work as well witout lyrics."
5,See the true Beauty Behind The Music,I've always felt like Pink Floyd produced some of the most beautiful music ever. This CD proves my point. Listening to this CD will make fans appreciate the true beauty of the music. Any fan of classical music should also find this CD quite enjoyable and it may even convert a few to Pink Floyd fans.
3,Good and bad,"You would think the marriage of classic, mostly DSOTM Floyd and epic Classical interpretations would be a perfect fit, though rarely are both elements calibrated in a way that either one does not feel self conscious. When it works it works well. Occasionally the London Philharmonic add their own notations to accentuate these unforgettable melodies. For at least a third of the album however, many of the direct translations come across as either flaccid, pandering, or just plain awkward."
2,"Where is the ""Dark Sarcasm""?","Although this production highlights the depth and complexity of these pieces, I believe it looses all the emotion and passion that Waters and Gilmore put into it. Instead of the despair and hopelessness, we are given light and sunshine - it misses the true Pink Floyd feeling. If they had gone more Russion, with heavier and deeper emotions, they would have had much better results."
1,An album far below my expection,"I bought this album as I am a fan of Pink Floyd. After I listened to this CD for no more than two time, I thought I was a fool, a waste of money. The music lacks soul. Distorted the spirit of Rock and Roll!!!"
1,"Please, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","If you are looking for something truly original with great orchestration, stay away from this CD. If you want white-washed poor renditions of classic Floyd songs, THIS ONE IS FOR YOU! I had so much hope for this album and was so disappointed, that I gave it away. It is MUSAK...better left for elevators than your personal stereo."
2,Roger and David would shed a tear hearing this,"One of my worse purchase in Y2K. A poor presentation and arrangement of Pink Floyd's music. The orchestra sounded small and weak, arrangement is boring and at times repetitive. Pink Floyd is never like that?!! 1 star for effort and another for the cover art. Somehow, that's too generous. BTW, if you're into good symphonic music playing pop/rock - get hold of ""Mega Movies"" from Telrac. Excellent recording and arrangement. Now, that's music."
2,Sacrilege,"When I pretend this is really some unknown Bulgarian piece of music, it even sounds nice at times. But then come the all-too familiar and beloved Pink Floyd themes - watered down to fit a 'symphonic' style. Because of this, the CD constantly reminds us of its shortcomings; it simply is not Pink Floyd, and can in no way replace it. Give me some honestly Bulgarian music instead."
2,Diamond Accent Cross in Circle Pendant,"Ordered easily and received promptly.The pendant is cheap, flimsy and disappointing. This came the day before Christmas, if I'd had time to purchase something else, I would have. I was extremely disappointed in every aspect of the quality, and embarrassed to give it as a gift. $50. would have been overpaying."
5,It's about the writing .........,"I loved this book, from start to finish. These stories were about more or less average women who put themselves, or get put!, into some unusual circumstances. The authors are professional writers, so don't worry about getting a first-time newbie trying to develop a short story.I got mine on Kindle from my local library, which is obviously a good deal, and it was worth every penny! (I'm just seeing if you are paying attention here). I would finish one story, and then say to myself. just one more and then it was just one more, and then it was 130AM. Hated that part.Some reviewers complain about the audiobook, and that may be true, but the BOOK is really really good. Get it."
2,Horrible narration spoils good stories,"The horrible narration, particularly Henrieta's, spoiled otherwise good stories. Get the hard copy instead. I'm just glad that I didn't pay anything for this as it was a library loan."
5,5 stars for the Strings Serenade & 4 stars for the Winds,Dvorak is one of my favorite composers and his Serenade for Strings in E is one of my all-time favorites. It is superbly played on this CD. The Wind Serenade is played pretty well too...
5,"A complicated murder, deftly rendered","A lovely young woman is assassinated in a very un-Dutch manner-- shot in her apartment seven times with what seems like a machine gun:""Van der Valk got the point. Even one gunshot is a rarity in Holland. Seven is exaggerating.""Van der Valk quickly discovers that her life was not as simple as it seemed and the search for the killer brings him to France to search for her past and ultimately leads him deep into the still-painful memories of the French war in Vietnam.Vintage Van Der Valk-- up there with _King of the Rainy Country_ and _Death in Amsterdam_. This would be an excellent book for either Freeling fans or for people just getting acquainted with the series."
1,No Response,After having these knives for about a year they start to chip and crack on the blade edges. They have been very-well cared for and always hand washed. We have sent several emails and tried calling Calphalon with no response for them it appears they could just care less.I would strongly recommend staying away from any of their products!!!!!!
4,"Good music, not so wonderful product","The reason I say it's not such a wonderful product is because it can't be played on a computer CD player, nor can it be ripped. Or maybe I just got a faulty copy...As others have said, this is a different band than Opera IX, former band of Cadaveria and Marcelo Santos (f.k.a. Flegias). The lyrics are more rebellious and less satanic. Marcelo looks like a cross-dresser in the pictures and is almost as ugly as Paul Allender. Cadaveria is a great vocalist; I don't know whether or not she's using voice distorters (it doesn't sound like she is), but that girl has some of the freakiest vocals in all metal. Way better than other 'extreme' female vocalists, even Angela Gossow. Killer Bob is great on the guitars. Good product but don't expect to put it onto your computer. The new album is even better."
4,"LAIMA, une anecdote musicale","LAIMA a de jolis yeux bleus et un disque unique à sa discographie. Qui plus est ancien....Tango est la très belle mélodie de l'album éponyme. Laima y traine une voix chaude et sensuelle qui me rappelle un peu Carly Simon. Elle est servie par quelques synthés et des cuivres rutilants très astiqués qui donnent bon ton à l'ensemble. ""What""s forever"" et ""dream love"" sont les petites perles de ce collier ancien et passé incognito. Dommage. Une anecdote historique qui m'a bien séduit."
4,Mathematical puzzle.,"Harry Barnett, a bit of a down and outer,is shocked on two counts.The first is to discover that he has a son from a brief fling, many years ago and secondly to be told that his son, David, is lying in a diabetic coma. David is a brilliant mathematician, employed by a rather secretive forecasting institute who previously employed several other scientists who died in mysterious circumstances.It's a good, imaginative plot and, given that I'm mathematically challenged, one that I had to force myself to understand. Poor Harry is a bit of a sad sack so things don't magically solve themselves for him as for other literary heros, but it's a story which will hold your attention until the end."
4,A notch below Into the Blue,"The central character from ""Into the Blue"" reappears in this book. A good read, but not up to the usual standards of Goddard. I wish the publisher would reprint "" Past Caring"" my favorite."
1,Save your money,"I bought this item new from Costco. Since I sleep with earplugs and don't hear my alarm, I thought the Wake & Shake would be a great purchase, I could use the shaker under my pillow to jolt me up in the mornings. WRONG! Straight from the box, the shaker mechanism was broken, Neither a shake nor shimmy to be had from it. The volume on the alarm is plenty loud, the flash alarm blinks as it should, and yes, there is a snooze button. But with the overall shoddy feel of the clock and the obvious poor quality, I'm not going to ask for an exchange, I'll just get a refund."
3,No SNOOZE,"Overall, the product is good, however, I was disappointed that there was no SNOOZE button. I had assumed that ALL alarm clocks came with them and wish I had known this prior to purchasing. Also, due to the absence of a SNOOZE button, I feel the product is overpriced."
5,if i could i would give this cd 10 stars.,"living sacrifice are all great guys i know cause i go to church with them and they are all on fire for god and iam buying this cd the day its released cause its imposssible to find the original since they are re-releasing thier cds.i bought the first repressed one and its good if you like the old school heavy metal but this stuff non existent and inhabit are the heaviest they ever put out and its awsome cause of the old bass and lead singer dj's voice it will make your skin crawl and the way the music changes and the drumms..... o man lance is so quick it will blow your mind i swear youv never heard any quicker than him he blows every band ive heard out of the water. except mindrage justin thier new drummer is quick to if your not broke get their new cd to its so tight.welp thats about it all i can say is inhabit and non existent are the best metal by sacrifice you can buy.Wesley Little rock, ark."
3,Dissapointing.....,"but still, it's good. This is pure death-metal. void expression, nonexistent and enthroned are the best songs. I would have to say that the vocals on this album is pretty weak, the weakest ever by LS. And the sound quality is pretty pathetic. This cd was produced by a guy who hadn't worked with any ""hard"" music before. That says it all. But I have to give the guys in LS credit for their skill. They really are some awesome musicians. The songs aren't too bad either, even though they sound the same. At least this album isn't a slayer rip-off, like their first album. I'm not really into Death metal, i'm more into trash, so this review is based on my personal opinion. I'm sure this is a great cd for all Death fans, so go ahead and get it."
2,paintball?,"I play real paintball, a lot. if you want the real paintballing experiance, play paintball. if you are just in it for for fun with out getting welts or covered in paint buy this."
2,STUPID ME,"I gto this game thinking it would be cool. And I ignored the other reveiws, which was my mistake. This game is fun the first time you play, but gets repetative VERY fast. I reccomend other than a paintball game that is plug-in-and-play, a game for a consle, like Call of Duty, or 007, or Battlefield 1942. The price is very high. Don't buy this. It does not make a good present."
1,sucks bad,very irratated it sucks so much i went to plug and play it then as i got to the menu screen i shot like your supposed to and it was shooting somewhere else advice dont even think to waste your money on this present this christmas parents.
5,mission paintball is cool,"i love mission paintball and i have been glued to the tv for 3 hours when i first got it. The day after that i woke up and i played at 8:45 in the morning just to get a hold of that cool toy paintball gun. The money was worth it and now on the 2nd day since i had it, im on the 6th level and im almost done the game! Thanks Toys'r'us for this great product and i would recommend this product to all of my friends and family so they can get their hands on this product themselves!"
1,Should be called Mission Crap,"This thing hasn't worked from day one.Yes, all instuctions have been followed correctly, and several attempts to contact Tiger Electronics have been ignored.So far the most fun we have had with this game is when we imagine smashing it with a hammer."
2,"VERY FUN GAME, BUT NOT UP TO PAR","LOVE THE GAME, BUT THE ACCURACY OF THE GUN IS NOT GOOD & KEEPS GETTING WORSE. MATTER OF FACT, I THINK THE GAME IS GOING TO QUIT ANYTIME. THE COLOR IS OFF & SCREENS ARE SCRAMBLED, THE ACCURACY IS GETTING WORSE, AND THE GAME SHUTS OFF ON ITS OWN SOMETIMES. IT'S WORKING POORLY & IT'S ASHAME BECAUSE WE LOVE THE GAME. IT JUST NEEDS SOME IMPROVEMENT IN DURABILITY."
1,A heartbreak for my son,"Excitement was in the air! An early Christmas at the Grandparents netted my son this Hasbro Mission Paintball Game. Upon opening and plugging it in however it didn't work.The power was on, the screen came up and the gun would highlight a few things yellow, but to aim and click on them was impossible. Clicking on the letters ABCD to build your first player name would show on the screen YOUA or any other odd creation. Never what you were spelling.Trying to get it to click 'accept' also was a losing proposition. The Accept would highlight in yellow but go no further. Cancel, accept, letters. Nothing worked. From 5 feet away from the tv to 4 inches from the screen.I have a very disappointed son. And a husband that is going to try to return it today and get a new one, based on the other reviews... maybe we just got a lemon."
1,What a disappointing toy!!!!,"It is hard enough these days finding toy for my 9 year old son that is not a video game. I bought this game for his birthday and he was so excited that we set it up right away. 4 kids standing waiting for a turn and we could not even get it passed the name screen. After about 1/2 hour of aimlessly shooting at the screen trying to sign in my son said ""Thanks, but just bring it back"" So I can't tell you if the game was good or not because we could never get it started."
3,TV YOU GOT TO USE,I GOT THIS GAME BUT THE PROBLEM IS U CAN'T USE A LCD OR OTHER TV THE ONE YOU GOT TO USE IS Standred tv
1,Horrible waste of time,Im a paintball guru and this game sucks. Its almost as fun as licking sandpaper. This is only good for people who cant play the game. even then its unrealistic. since when do the enemies just stand in a field and shoot. how lame. I am truly angered that you made the awesome sport of paintball look so boring and dumb.
1,Works with standard glass screen TV's only,"We got this today and can't use it because we have LCD screens. It might be a great toy but we have no way of knowing. I gave it one star because I had to give it something but this is meaningless - sorry:)Unfortunately when we ordered this there was no mention of the basic requirements. So for the benefit of others here are the requirements copied from the instruction we downloaded from Harbro* TV or VCR with AV input. RF adapter required if TV has no AV input. Or, you may use the AV input on a VCR that's connected to your TV.* Standard glass screen TV only. Not for use with Projection, LCD, High Definition, or Flat Screen (Plasma) TV.IMPORTANT: You cannot play this game through a cable box or satellite hookup. Game must be connected directly to the TV or VCR.I hope others are having fun with this toy and that this ""review"" will prevent people with non-glass TV screen from making the same mistake we made."
5,paintbal mission,i got this game even after reading a few of the bad reviews some saying that they never could get it to work . i love my game it has worked from the beginning and even though the graphics are those from another day it is a very fun game to play regardless the graphics .. i would recommend it but my grandson who is six could not get into the game it is for those a little older than six i suppose but my three yeaar old loved shooting at the objects on the graphics and it kept him happily occupied . i showed it to my neighbor who really liked it as well and he is buying one for his family as we speak ..
2,Not too good.,I bought this for my 6 yr old son. He did not like it at all. He endedup cutting the cords off so he could use it as a pretend gun.Cheap game that doesnt play quite right. Definitely paid toomuch for this.
3,Arson,"Having read this book a few years ago along with the two follow ups Rattler and Silver Saddlesand somehow lent my copy of Arson I wished to re-purchase the first book in this very enjoyableseries , A very easy read , and a lot of fun . I have enjoyed all the titles in the series. I hadwaited for some time to aquire another copy of Arson and look forward to re-reading the series againLes Breen"
2,Miscellaneous Spanish Guitar Music,"Frankly, I was disappointed by this 2 disc audio CD product. Except for a very few lively popular pieces of music, the rest of the tracks on this CD seemed to be dreary and melancholic music. There are a few outstandingguitarist performers but their guitar music was drowned out by the orchestral accompaniment. Much of the music on the discs is however, and is fortunately, solo guitar."
1,Film was very poor quality,"I've always loved ordering from amazon and have always been pleased, however this was a huge disappointment. The film quality of this tape was worse than some 20 yr old home movie video. I don't know why the quality was so poor, maybe it was dubbed over alot, its a mystery. Songs were ok, but lighting and filmography were very poor. I also don't care for it when we don't know what songs are on a video either. This has been my one and only disappointment with any order from amazon. This tape appeared to be filmed in the late 70's or early 80's judging from the hairstyles of the fans, and also Merle looked pretty young. However, I doubt if this had anything to do with the quality, it simply was not a very well made tape."
4,Western swing for the new era,"Merle Haggard's style is very much a harback to the days of Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, Lefty Frizzell and Bob Wills. He can really capture their style and do it very convincingly. However, sometimes he over-tries to be some of his idols (as any Bob Wills cover Haggard does shows) and he thus doesn't have as original a style as a George Jones or a Jerry Lee Lewis. However, Haggard is above the law and this is 100% oldtime country entertainment at its best."
5,A Great Support of Relief,"I already purchased this brand of bra several years ago and am very familiar with the support that it gives. This purchase was even better. Because gravity plays a major role in the support of very large breast, this bra is a sustainer of support for the back, stomach, and shoulders."
3,book is okay,"The book was shipped fast, but it came with a strong smokey odor. Other than that, it was as described."
5,Service and Product UNDERrated,"I am new to making online purchases, and this is the 2nd time that I've ordered from Amazon. Not sure of how to pick a company for a used item, I took a chance and picked one based on description and reviews. I wasn't expecting to receive my book for at least 2-3 weeks...it came in the mail 3 days later!! The condition was wayyy better than described. This book is like brand new!! I love it, and will definately order again!!"
2,..... groan,"A predictable and not very polished piece of genre fluff. Not a sophisticated piece of writing and pretty silly, at best. I'd say a beach read in paperback but certainly not a highly rated novel. And the cute conceits (lobster newburg is his agent and a gimmick at the conclusion) are painful."
4,A good mystery book,"This is the first book that I have read by this author and it was anenjoyable one.The story was good, not cluttered with too many details. The characters are believable and interesting.It starts with a murder and the flawed main character has to try to work out why this person was murdered.Enjoyed reading the book, and fans of mysteries will probably enjoy reading it also.J. Robert Ewbank, author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"Not my favorite Russell Andrews, but still interesting","After having read the first two titles (Gideon/Icarus) by this author (actually Russell Andrews is a pen name) I was delighted to find that Aphrodite had hit the shelves. The first two titles had a mystical feel to the mystery found in the book. This one was more of a main stream tale, and the concepts presented were almost Michael Palmerish.The story is about a small town policeman, down on his luck, who stumbles onto a murder conspiracy involving the F.B.I., Persian War vets and ethics in medical development. The yarn moves quickly and it will certainly keep the reader's attention, just not to the extent that the previous works did."
3,Really only worth 2.5 stars,"For the type of book it is, it is quite well written, if a tad cliched. (How about we try the big city cop moves to small village because he's lazy?) Good characterization. Fast paced. BUT...work with me here. It takes place in the present day. The secret people are dying over has to do with stem cell research. And we find this out because some guy who should only be in his 80s is really 116. Well, by my calculation they must have started the secret treatments on him well over 40 years ago. Stem cells in 1966? I don't think so. Save this book for the beach."
3,First time reading this author,"I was really enthused when I started reading this book - the plot and characters were terribly interesting and I could not put the book down. But the last couple chapters just kind of fell apart, and as other reviewers have stated, it 'wrapped up TOO neatly' with no plausability at all. Left me feeling like the author lost interest and was just anxious to finish the book. How disappointing. I will try his other books but will certainly be wary this time. I read 2-3 books a week minimum so am always looking for good authors."
3,"Good Product, outragis price",This is a very good product that is a simple install. But for 2 ieces of plastic it is a 10.00 retail part at best.If priced more competive they would see more of these sell. And this is a adapter to use a air breather they sell. They would move more of the primary product if not for this high price! I have been in the automotive business for over 35 years. A GM Powertrain Consultant.I have a pulse on the aftermarket and this is a great item for the installation of the primary product they want to sell. Price makes it not worth the cost.IMO
4,Troubling but mostly brilliant,"This is an excellent, hilarious and often disturbing collection of short stories. My one criticism is that the penultimate story, an account of a protest against the Iraq war, is so tonally different from the other pieces that it rings false. The other stories have an almost Beckett-like abstraction and eternal quality, the penultimate story has already dated."
5,Affects your spatial and temporal awareness!,"Waves of spiritual delights combined with rhythms of sensuality. A unique and hard to find blend of hip-hop rhythms with ethereal sounds... Pilgrimage CAN affect your spatial and temporal awareness by transporting your mind to another time and place. Do you like Dead Can Dance? Then you will definitely enjoy Pilgrimage. In its own musical style it also profound, out-there and absolutely fabulous in its dreamlike and sensuous effect."
5,Must...have...more...PILGRIMAGE!,"This album has to be one of my all-time favorites, right up there with Adiemus and Deep Forest's first album. The combination of laid back grooves and the etherial vocals give this album a permanent spot in my all-nighter stack. And the first cut is definitely a great test for your subwoofer- if you're playing it on teensy speakers without a sub, you're missing the best part. I just hope they're going to do more!"
2,feedback on samples,"The best track on this album is by far Pilgrimage itself (track 3). I discovered this particular track on a double compilation called Euphoria (released 2001)which I would classify as just amazingly brilliant(stuff which I would call inspiring; well, you know, the kind of music that would get you to say 'so what?' when you've had a terribly miserable day). I was so taken by this particular track that I was too eager to check the rest of Pilgrimage on Amazon..Rather disappointing..The rest of the tracks are far from, should we say, mesmerising......."
1,run o' the mill boredom,"I should have knowned when it was compared favorably by someone to Enigma, but got fooled by others that likened it to Dead Can Dance. I'm right now listening to the fourth track and have had to skip through all of them so far as they all sound like different variations of the same wallpaper. Sorry I wasted my money, anyone want it?"
4,This book was never designed to be a bestseller!,"This is a great book for foodies that cook. I honestly don't think ""normal"" people would like this book at all. It contains methods and ingredients used in Italy. You don't learn to chop and the basic stuff in this book. So if you are familiar with French technique you can still gain a lot from this detailed book. You typically learn the techniques while following one of the many recipes in the book. However, note that we are talking classic Italian food. More complicated procedures have loads of black and white photos (the quality of reproduction is not great, but okay)."
2,"Not a brainship, not avenged","Set in McCaffrey's ""Brainship Universe"" the book starts off well, bringing onstage the now 23 year old, smart and pretty, blonde JOAT with her ship WYAL (not a brainship but with a likable AI). The first three quarters of the book move right along, not too many characters, neatly divided between the good and the bad, and a clear if somewhat simple plot. Then, when the story is set for a nice (if perhaps unimaginative) finish, suddenly a lot of complications are thrown in as if the writer forgot his 101 writing class (open story: main character suddenly in trouble and has to do something to get out of trouble, take it from there till main character is out of trouble). From then on there is to much trouble for JOAT to do anything about it, nothing makes sense, everybody does just the opposite of what they promised to do and JOAT is thrown back and forth like a rag dol, boom, fortunately she lands in the black, somehow (how?). End of book."
2,not up to snuff,"This is not a book about a brainship, it is a sequel to a brain space station book. While it was a little disappointing not to be about a brainship, it had great potential. In fact, it was really good until the end where it seems as if they suddenly realized they had to meet a deadline and quick wrote the last 10 pages, which of course made no sense. Bad endings are bad. It could have been a stellar book."
2,Fairly weak,"This book just isn't up to the standard of the other episodes in the BrainShip series. The plot and the characters show promise, but the polish and fun of the other books is missing. The main villian is absolutely flat and serves mainly as a blatent plot device. The various logic inconsistancies pile up until the plot collapses totally about 75% of the way into the story. I also noticed a large number of editing errors. ""ass"" instead of ""ask"", ""hum"" instead of ""him"", and so forth. Not recommended for anybody but a die-hard fan."
3,The Ship Avenged (although not really a brainship),"This is NOT a brain ship story.If you like McCaffrey, you'll read and like it well enough. However, when I first read it, I thought it was a CHEAT.All the previous brainships were human minds and the stories related to the ship as protagonist. This ship is simply an artificial intelligence used to fake a brain brawn story with Joat, a character introduced in an earlier book.Joat is the main character and the story is ok, but I'd have liked it better if this had been about some way of getting Joat into a real brain/brawn relationship in spite of impossible odds."
3,Don't buy the Hardback!,"I am a diehard Stirling fan, and this is the weakest of his books. ""The City who Fought"" was wonderful, and this is just uninspired. I conjecture that working out of his own universe took its toll. Go back and read any of his other books, and give this one a miss. Even Joat is toned down. When she confronts her Uncle, all she does is punch him in the nose!!. Not the old rip their eyes out Joat we knew and loved in ""City who Fought"""
4,Ra Material,"The Ra Material comes from a high spirit relm and is therefore difficult to understand. Eventhough Ra starts each session with ""love and light"", the actual material feels extremely objective; we are one giant experiment. Ra is also trying to correct problems it created in Egypt and elsewhere 10,000 years ago for it's own spiritual growth. Very valuable for origin of humankind."
5,Magnetizing and Powerful!!!,"THE LAW OF ONE: Book I, is by far the most profound, and awe inspiring piece of information I've ever come across. After buying it through a friend's strong recommendation...it actually sat on my dresser collecting dust for almost 2 years. Admitting I was, once again, guilty of judging a book by its cover; I had actually been putting off a life changing/enhancing experience.. of biblical proportions. This is coming from a former skeptic of channeled information, and also someone well aware of the hoards of government employed disinformation campaigns, that are working against the mind opening revelations of truth!"
4,Hang on you are in for a journey!,Hello all! It has been quite a while since i felt i needed to write a review. This book seems to ask most of the questions detailing the beliefs in the unknown in the UFO/Spiritual issue. If you are just beginning to take serious interests in this type genre then hang on because it is quite a bit to handle. Book II is tough to follow which I would recommend reading a second or third time since the page count is not to drawn out. As of this review i havent started Book III. Enjoy.
5,The RA Material explains everything about everything!,"The RA Material explains everything about everything and even more. In reading the full series of The Law of One Books, I discovered how little I knew about life, our perceived reality and its true purpose. The material contained within this set of books answers humanity's eternal questions; questions like ""Who am I?"" and ""Why am I here?"" The magnitude and brilliance of the truth revealed by The Law of One laid the foundation for the writing of my own book, ""Flying Between Heaven and Earth."" I wanted to offer another avenue for people to receive the messages brought to us by the RA Group through Don Elkins, Carla Rueckert, and Jim McCarty. If you really want answers, answers to questions that you could never think to ask, then you have come right place. You are in for the ride of your life with The RA Material!Gina E. JonesAuthor of ""Flying Between Heaven and Earth""Flying Between Heaven and Earth"
3,Yeah Ra-ight,This book IS entertaining to read but hard to swallow. I mean Genghis Khan is a shipping clerk on another planet in the Orion constellation? Yeah right...
2,Question and answer session,"In his preface, James explains that his reason for writing this book was to answer the ""many questions and of the kind that's been asked of me often."" Although packaged in the guise of a story, UNCLE BILL manages to be little more than a question and answer book-and only slightly more entertaining.The premise is simple: two city children, Scootie and Kip Powers, come west to visit their cattleman uncle for a summer. Their uncle, being busy with ranch affairs, turns the kids over to an old cowpuncher known as ""Uncle Bill"" (no relation). Uncle Bill hauls the kids all across the range, teaching them to ride, rope, and take care of themselves. Although a few of Uncle Bill's stories are amusing, his unending instructive speeches have a decidedly didactic feel.I rather doubt that even children would find this story entertaining."
2,finally finished it,"I received this book for x mas from my partner on a recommendation from the reviews on amazon. its now July .. and try as i might, i am still on chapter 3. i think the main problem is, Russell tried too hard with too many words to draw the charactersOK finally finished the book on august. This was one of the longest, dullest reads I have ever had. I didn't care about the characters in the slightest. I was looking forwards to this book, but I was greatly disappointed. Don't waste your money!"
2,"Pointless, obvious, 2-dimensional fairy tale...","I really TRIED to like this book, but in the end, it was impossible. I was hoping for a little depth, a little insight, a little of the sexual tension that's so clear in other classic prep-school novels to which The Coming Storm has inevitably been compared.There are a couple of promising relationships established here, but their potential is never realized. This book is characterized mostly by lost opportunity, as the potential for character and situational depth gives way to simplistic stereotyping that could just as easily have been composed by a homophobe as by one within the fold.Obviously, St Martin's Press (a/k/a Stonewall Inn Editions, their queer imprint) has no problem promoting mediocrity. I just hate to think of all the talented gay writers who are having a tough time breaking in while this ditzy author and his fluff novel gets all the glory.P.S. What dimwit picked this title? Did anyone else find it utterly telegraphic and inane???"
2,"Annoying, tiresome, and infuriating","I will not deny that Russell has talent with his words. However, just past the halfway mark through the novel I became so angered by the plot (extremely slow and ponderous up until mid-book) and the characters that I threw the book across the room and never opened it again. In fact, I tossed it. No recycling, no used book store. The trash heap. I felt he had created characters that he hoped we would care about and then, when it became clear he had grown bored with the story and their roles, made them into masochistic icons. If you are bothered by unsafe sex, especially with the notion of ""bug-chasers"" this book will hurt you."
4,Shcoking!,"Loved this book. It is filled with twists, and horrible revelations. Some of the implications and revelations that you read are never made aware to the characters they effect! I sometimes wanted to shout into the books screaming WAKE UP WAKE UP!It is a wonderful novel about choices and first loves and the painful process of coming out.I really recommend it to everyone!"
4,Carries you along to a stunning conclusion...,"The careful rendering of the main characters occurs in a surprisingly non-formulaic plot --- to a neat conclusion that begs for a sequel. The writing is mostly beautiful, at times lyrical, only rarely opaque. The jarring explicitness of the sex --- at first, off-putting --- turns out to be quite necessary to the task at hand. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!"
5,"Stunning, amazing, captivating, facinating - read it today!","Like many of the other reviewers here I was deeply moved by Paul Russell's earlier book The Sea of Tranquility. The Sea of Tranquility will remain one of my favorite books of all time.Since reading The Sea of Tranquility I have been waiting for a new book from Paul Russell and The Coming Store was sure worth the wait! The characters and events are astonishing. For me the book evoked memories of my own life. Often I had to put the book down and reflect on my own experiences for a while! As many have noted the writing is top notch, however what I found particularly amazing is how the events unfold in such a highly realistic manner. Paul knows exactly what he is writing about!If you purchase it I hope you don't need much sleep because from the first page to the last you will not be able to put it down. Like real life experiences the ending of this book may leave you smiling and wondering ""what if ..."""
3,last 150 pages,I enjoyed this. The last 150 pages are worth the read if you can just hang in on the first 200. Tracy is the kind of guy you would love as a friend.
2,The Coming Storm,"First off, let me say I loved Sea of Tranquility. So Iapproached this new novel as a fan, excited to read it. But once intoit, I was instantly bogged down in prose that seems tired, at best. Every scrap of dialogue, line by line most of the time, is glued down with reflections, reactions, ruminations, memories, allusions, wispy sexual fantasies, subplots, or (sometimes even ""and"") snide rejoinders. It takes pages and pages of overwrought, adjective-laden prose just to get there. I am not one for Grisham-style speed. But I would like the plot, hackneyed and tired as it is, to move a little faster. After all, from the start, we know where this thing's going. Sure, you can get on the interstate and go somewhere you've been before. You can even take some of the turn-offs. But why do you have to examine every single blade of grass along a route well-traveled?"
4,The Coming Storm,"I found this novel rather excellent. My only criticism is that theending seemed somewhat prosaic and perhaps just a bit ""rushed""."
1,These are NOT fine tip!,"These are touted as fine tip, which is what I bought them for, but I can get a THINNER line from the corner of my chisel tip ~ I am not pleased at all by these markers with their fat round tip ~ they need to rename these as a medium point = I will not be purchasing anything further from Quartet"
5,"Nice fine point, write upside down just fine, and good color","Very nice and bold. The colors are nice and loud and in two weeks use they haven't shown any sign of slowing down. They're also nice and stylish in case you care about that. I like that you can see the ink level in them too. And they don't smell much that I've noticed. So overall, 5-stars."
1,Poor Quality,"I was very disappointed by these markers. They must have been very old or something because minutes after taking them out of the plastic, the ink seemed so faint and weak. The colors were incredibly faded and I was going to return them but just didn't have the energy. Total waste of money. Not pleased at all."
3,"Yeah, they work",PARTY ROCKYEAWhoa!!!!LET'S GO!!Party rock is in the house tonightEverybody just have a good timeAnd we gonna make you lose your mindEverybody just have a good timeParty rock is in the house tonightEverybody just have a good timeAnd we gonna make you lose your mindEverybody just have a good timeWe just wanna see you!Shake that!
4,Excellent dry erase markers!,"These are definitely what you should be looking for in a dry erase marker. They are smooth writing and fairly priced. The one thing to note is that the ""ink"" dies go fast with them. If you were using them in a classroom environment each marker would likely last about two weeks."
4,Not really fine tip,"The pens write nicely, but the tip is not what I expected as ""fine""--like a pen. The tip seems more medium. The picture of the tip is actually smaller than actual size."
1,Hard to review a product I can't use...,"Now granted, a lot of this is my fault - this is the first Plantronics set I've bought, and I don't know the lingo or many details about headsets... BUT... it would have been nice at *some point* during the purchase if I'd been warned this just doesn't work without the separate modular adapter.I went back to the site to double check and the only place the adapter is mentioned is under the ""Accessories"" section. (Unlike Paris Hilton, I view ""Accessories"" as optional.)For ~$50, this seemed like a great deal - for the $120+ I'd *really* have to spend (to go back now and purchase the adapter as well)... hmmm... yeah, not so much."
3,The Good Side of 3/5,"I'm not quite sure what I Think about Blooming Origami but what I Feel is that the book is Ok. It's well done and the diagrams are clear. The models are interesting - complex but achievable. I've enjoyed most of it so far.The part that I don't like about the models are that a lot of them require scissors. I made a New Year's Resolution in 2009 to memorize a flower model so that I could fold one anywhere, anytime. And therein lies my problem with the book: I can't meet my resolution without scissors. I don't see a solution because complex models require complex bases that require scissors to form. I've got myself a Catch-22. I can't fault the models, but I can't quite celebrate them. I expect other books are the same.However, if you know-about and accept the scissors from Day 1, I think you'll love the book for some of the gems it contains."
2,Poorly executed,"The game was poor by any reasonable standard. The AI was horrible, and it was full of glitches. In one area the soldier nearby was about 8 ft off the ground and standing in a wall. The gameplay was exceptionally weak. There were times and I got stuck where no matter what I seemed to do the game ended saying I ""abandoned my post"" (this was following the compas waypoints) or ""scarpello was killed"". It just seemed poorly executed, as if enough time wasn't spent creating the game and working out the bugs. Save your money, even for $10 it's debatable if it's worth the frustration."
2,Not a good one,This game was very short. It seemed to have promise but the execution fell WAY short. Maybe next time guys.....
5,Death of a Colonial,"Another of the Sir John Fielding mysteries and just as good as the rest. Bruce Alexander takes you back to 18th century London, creating the feel of time and place. As I read, I can almost smell the streets where chamber pots were emptied out of windows and meat spoiled while hanging in butchers' stalls. The narrative pulls the reader along the course of an investigation of several home invasions which have, so far, resulted in two deaths. Sir John is unable to pursue the investigation so he has his ward, Jeremy, seek out clues and question witnesses in the great houses, the coffee shops and gin mills of Westminster,"
4,Very evocative of the period.,"One of Mr. Alexander's talents is bringing his historical period to life, and he does this extremely well in this book. The book is set in England in 1771, so we get a good glimpse of life in London at this time, but in this book we also get a glimpse of the vacation town of Bath and the university town of Oxford. The book is rich in detail of this period. It is also chock-full of English justice as it was in this time. There wasn't much mystery here because we know all along who the murderer is, but Sir John and his ward Jeremy must prove it. They are trying to solve an [...]case that seems eerily familiar with what is happening right now, and with the arrival of the villain from eight years ago into England. He is a rough individual from the American colonies. These books are totally entertaining, and I enjoy the look back at a much earlier time, especially since Mr. Alexander's prose is so evocative."
2,Fusion pioneer on autopilot,"Too much of this sounds (as another reviewer aptly describes it) like ""Fu-zak"": bland and hummable but ultimately unmemorable. (You know the kind of song you hear as the 'theme song' to cable public access talk shows? I was reminded of that several times while listening to this...)Only sporadically did songs from this one jump out at me (""Time Track"" and the title track are 2 of the better cuts) and several cuts (""Flamingo"" is a case in point) were downright yawners. There's no question these are fine players and that Corea himself was critical to the formation of jazz-rock fusion as a member of Return to Forever but this just doesn't excite me.BOTTOM LINE:I'm at a loss as to why I bought this one now that I listen to it years after purchase. Definitely one to skip. For a better look at Corea's fusion powers, try the self-titled CHICK COREA ELEKTRIC BAND (ASIN B0000001PW) or his former band Return to Forever's ROMANTIC WARRIOR (ASIN B00004HYLF)."
1,FICTION TRYING TO BE PASSED OFF AS TRUTH,"The author had four interviews with the late Joe Murphy of Occidental, California, a former member of the IWW and something of a ""professional"" Wobbly in his later years, and uses the groundwork to write a very misleading and false work.I knew Joe murphy, I too interviewed him, and you could take half of what he said and ignore it.You could then ignore the other half of this book."
2,Common Sense,"While Hendricks knows what it takes to teach effectively, I was disappointed with this book. If you are looking for a book to learn how to effectively communicate well with students, this book will be helpful. If you already have good communication skills and common sense in how to connect with students, you'll find this book to be mostly review without any exciting new insights. Please don't let this discredit Dr. Hendricks' other books. Make sure to purchase a copy of Living By the Book by Howard and William Hendricks."
2,Teaching-Change Lives,I had to return this book as the supplier did not ship it in time and I could not use it. I am disappointed as I thought it would be a good resource. I will not be using this supplier again.
2,Not sure,"I'm not really sure about this dvd. Don't get me wrong, I love David Phelps. I will say this, he is much better sticking with Bill Gaither type songs than what he tries to do on his own. He seems to try too hard. I don't know, I can't put my finger on it. The dvd is ok, not too impressed. I guess it just depends on what you like in personality."
5,Superb,"We are most pleased with this purchase, but ten words are a minimum requirement to submit this form and I have nothing more to say. David Phelps is the greatest tenor in the world."
2,Need watchmaker to change battery.,Beautiful watch but hard on battery and once you remove the back to change the battery you have to find a watchmaker to replace it with a specialized press.
3,nice looking watch,"watch looks nice I just thought it would come with a chain, it did not come with warranty information as stated in description"
3,A very good rendition,"I lost my previous version of the Brandenburg Concertos, and couldn't remember who did them, so thinking Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields is a safe choice (I almost always like how they perform anything), I bought this one. It's typical Marriner, orchestrated and performed as it should be. It just doesn't seem quite as exciting as I remembered my previous version was - but maybe that's just a trick of memory. I'm happy with it."
3,interesting find,"I came across this CD in a used record store for cheap, and being a fan of Bowie and Eno, as well as Phillip Glass's minimalist compositional style, I picked it up. It didn't blow me away per se, but I found it to be an extremely impressive and captivating work. The way the compositions build is incredibly well orchestrated, and, though numerous liberties were taken with the originals, Glass's reworkings still fit the originals well enough, and provide interesting new interpretations for old fans and new. The work also serves to expose Bowie and Eno to a classical audience, an interesting though in and of itself :-)"
3,Not as expected,"These spoons were not as heavy as I expected. They will bend more easily than other spoons, but are serviceable for my purposes."
5,For work...,These are sturdy spoons that can be used for anything. I actually brought them to work and eat my lunch with them because I like the long stem to reach into deep bowls and the small spoon for my small mouth:)
5,wonderful,I've been buying these for years and was delighted to find them on Amazon. Super value here.
4,Great Sticks; Packaging So-So,"I don't buy these Macy's Cheese Sticks often, but it seems as if there are changes to the packaging each time. The last time I had bought a supply, I was put off by the fact that the entire shipment was exceptionally dry and the ""Melting Parmesan"" was more like ""Crunchy Crackly Whatsit"". This shipment (and I trust that the other 11 boxes are the same) was truly what it claimed (a pleasure). On the other hand, the packaging wasn't up to par. Many products today use a laudable packaging technique which provides the buyer with a means of locking the package closed, and this package is no exception. Except that the Cheese Sticks package doesn't accomplish that which may have been intended. I'm compelled to use a paper clip or rubber band if I want the package to remain closed."
5,A poingnant look at the complexity of relationships,"What a gloriously sad novel ""What Girls Learn"" is! At once humorous, insightful, satisfying, and, above all, REAL, Karin Cook's first novel explores the complexity of mother-daughter and sister-sister relationships. But even if you have neither a mother nor a sister, this book is a great read. It is a book to be literally devoured, and be sure to leave yourself some time to cry and reflect when you finish it. Believe me, you will need to. The second I shut the book, I ran to my mom's room, crawled into bed with her, and simply breathed in her scent and aura. If you don't live with your mom, this book will definitely make you run to the phone and call her. I HIGHLY recommend buying a copy for yourself, and one for a good friend."
3,just another coming of age story,"..albeit a well-written one. You have the absent dad, the ""Anywhere But Here"" bonding, the tragic illness, the burgeoning sexuality. All the right ingredients for a coming of age story. (Maybe it's harder than I think to expand the blueprint.) The main characters managed to be more than just the stereotypes expected in this kind of book, and there were some great scenes, but overall, I would give it three stars. The TV-movie made a few years ago is worth catching, though."
3,Unsatisfactory ending,"I thought that What Girls's Learn was an entertaining book dealing serious issues like growing up and cancer. The only problem that I had with the book was the ending. I feel the the author did a diservice to readers by including two resolutions. Personally I believe that the author should have ended with the chapter entitled ""Memory"" because I feel that it desplays the true process of death, and it fits in more with the overall tone of the novel. Also I feel that ""Memory"" ties the main themes of the book together in a way that provides readers with a satisfying feeling."
2,The ending,"I feel that the ending of the book was well writen, but the last chapter of the book was unnecessary. I felt that the chapter Procession held enough closure to end the book with the reader felling satisfied. In Procession Elizabeth ends the rivaling sisterhood by explaining to Tilden that she doesn't really hate her. There is an unspoken understanding and settling peace between them now. The chapter ended the same way that the book started, with the two girls being together. However, in Memory, new issues are brought up about Tilden being depressed and not sure how she is going to handle her problems without her mom. It felt that after all their issues were resolved, Tilden regresses by restating that she was still upset. I think that the novel would have been better if the chapter Memory had been edited out."
3,a good young adult novel- quite predictable...,"I thought this novel had a nice story line, good character development but I also found it basic and boring at times.Though I appreciated the emotional aspect of such a work, it was very predictable for the avearge person. I think I would have enjoyed it more had I read it in highschool and not been so familiar with tragedy and real life situations. I thought it was pretty simplistic and didn't keep me very motivated to continue. It was a good quick and easy read though- it was easy to follow and did reach a somewhat emotional level. Given the subject matter I felt it would have been a bit deeper, I never got the raw emotion feeling that I was expecting."
4,"Beautiful novel for girls, boys, men, women","Deeply emotional, nuanced, a dead-on depiction of what it's like to be an adolescent girl, the dark and bright sides. The flap copy says mothers and daughtrs should read it together. Absolutely! And so should guys -- 'cause then they'll get it"
3,Decent novel,"This was an interesting book. It chronicles the changing lives of two sisters, Tilden and Elizabeth, their journey through adolescence and how they deal with their mom's cancer. There are two endings in the book, but I preferred the second one, Memory, because of the way it detailed the process of losing someone close and each person's reaction to the tragedy.Cook also does a good job of expressing the details of what each character is thinking or feeling at a particular time and presents universal themes in a unique and poignant storyline."
3,The conclusion to the book,"In my opinion, i thought the book was put together very well, but it lacked the correct storyline to make the book interesting. The end to the book was slightly emotional, and i felt the reader could relate to what the girls/mother were going through. I thought the book tried way to hard to create an excessive amount of sympathy within the reader. This became overcoming in the conclusion and made me feel like i didnt want to read the book any more. The ending of the book can be argued to be in 2 different chapters, memory and posession. I felt that the ending was most clearly expressed in the chapter entitled ""posession"". In this chapter the girls feelings were most clearly expressed, and they received the most closure also. Overall, this book had its good points and its bad point, but still remains a book that i would not read again."
3,Memory or Epilogue?,"The end of the book What Girls Learn concludes in the chapter called Memory. I feel that this chapter is best described by renaming it an epilogue. Because the chapter is a few years after the actual story takes place, it concludes the entire plot by showing the girls in the years after the story. In this section, the main character and narrator, Tilden, comes to terms with the tragedy of the story, her mother's death. It shows how she has dealt with the loss of a loved one and the way her life has turned out as a result of this. Even though Tilden says ""nothing could have prepared her for this"", she realizes that her mother may be physically gone from her life, but her spirit will live on forever in her heart."
2,Which chapter is the real end,"After reading this book I have realized that there is actually two different endings. The last two chapters could both be the ending to the book. The book would still have the same effect even if one of these chapter was cut out. I think that the chapter ""Procession"" is a better fit ending to this book. I think that it is a better ending because it ends with all three of them driving and being together. In the begining of the book we see how the three of them are very close and always together. So this chapter actually puts some closure to her death and the girls realize that they are going to be on their own. This chapter shows tham dealing with their mom's death and how they are going to have to go on with each other and without their mom. This ending is better than the chapter ""Memory"" because memory is almostr like an epilogue and it shows the girls a few years down the road. It doesn't put actual closure to their mom's death."
5,A must read for anyone who has ever struggled to become.,"This book is a must read for all women and girls, a mirror to so many experiences we all face growing up; the changes(or lack of changes) our bodies are going through, the pressue to shadow what our peers say and do. Our sexuality! The loss of the girls mother to breast cancer is quite possibily the most realistic depiction I have read yet. The emotions experienced by Elizabeth and Tilden were raw and heartwrenching, without seeming melodramatic or forced.These are characters that remain in your heart long after you put the book down. This is a story I shall never forget. Thank you Karin Cook, for your tremendous talent is a gift to those who experience it."
5,A social analysis of the computer's effects on life,"How do computers affect such diverse social issues as cultural diversity, educational quality and ecological systems? Let Them Eat Data provides a social analysis of the computer's effects on life, considering how computer-enforced cultural patterns contribute to global ecological problems. A unique, involving probe of some unusual effects of the new computer world."
2,"A good story, unevenly written.","Throughout the book, Stroud chooses to muddle first and third person. This is done only in the sections told from the perspective of Bartimaeus (the demon), who will speak as 'I' and then speak of 'the guinea pig' or 'the bat', Bartimeaeus _being_ (at that point in the narrative) the guinea pig or the rat. It is disconcerting, and repeatedly jolts the reader into full awareness that he or she is reading an awkwardly written piece of text. This makes it impossible to remain immersed in the story -- which is a pity, because Stroud's world is a fascinating one.Another thing that struck me as unfortunate is that Nathaniel, far from becoming more multidimensional as a character, is losing complexity. Bartimaeus, on the other hand, is being given new facets.I hold hope for the third book in the trilogy. Perhaps, by the time that one is written, Stroud will have found an editor who can help him to decide between first-person usage and third."
3,comparing to the first book ... this one is a disappointment!,"The first book was better than this one by far. The action and event sequence was much better than the second book, not to mention the plot. Here I knew the bad guy since the start; it was so obvious in many parts.I could hardly read the rest of the book; it was much more descriptive in a boring way. Oh and I don't want to remember Kitty's chapters, I fought with myself just to keep reading through them.I really missed the magic we got in the Amulet of Samarkand. I hope the last book is better than this one; well I can't miss it after all can I?"
4,Sarcastic humor at its finest,"As with The Amulet of Samarkand, the book's main demon, Bartimaeus, steals the show with his hilariously sarcastic humor. His sarcastic wit alone makes this book worth reading.Moreover, the complicated plot and use of a very sympathetic character, Kitty, made this book even more enjoyable than the first in the trilogy. As with the first book, the author's intertwining of real places and historical figures with fantasy - such as Golems in Prague and a demon whose essence is fused with the skeleton of William Gladstone - makes for very interesting reading."
5,a great read,"i greatly enjoyed the amulet of samarkand and was plesently suprised to find that the gollems eye was infact better then its predeseser.after the events in the last book nathaniel has florished into a great up and comming magition. he has been on the track of the ressistance for some time, and is optimistic that they will be caught and brought to justice, even though they seem to show some strange abilitys to see demons. however he is having great trouble to find a good demon to do his bidding. After many attempts he resummons his old djinn a sharp tounged demon named bartimaeus. but soon they realise that the ressistance is the least of there probolems.This is a great read and if you havent allready read it you should!"
3,DISAPOINTING!!!- not as good as the first!,"i greatly anticipated this book's release and grabbed it as soon as it came onto the shelf. unfortunately, it only got interesting until part 2 or 3. it was hard to get into, unlike the first one. NOw, the first one was something!!! interesting from the first word. This one,well, took some time. Bartimaeus is an absolute wonder. Nathaniel is an idiot!!! quite annoying. gosh sometimes you wanna shout SHUT THE... UP!!! at him! Kitty is really cool. you begin to see her side of the story and she's amazing. It begins to portray the Resistance as the 'good' side and begins to show all the evils of the magicians. What was a bit odd was that the highly feared and terrifying ""RESISTANCE"" was actually just a bunch of kids and adults... only 11 of them in fact! Anyway, this book was disapointing but it did have a sort of good storyline.... just hope that #3 is better!!!"
3,I like it but it can get a little boring at times.,It is interesting. I like the first book more thought. If your looking for a short read this book is not for you.
5,Loved this series!,"I absolutely love this series, all three books. I wish Bartimaeus was my friend :) I have read all 3 books twice.Now on to reading the prequel.."
2,The Golem's Eye,Kept waiting for something interesting to happen. If it did I didn't find it. Snow falling is more exciting or as my dad would say it would have been more fun watching paint dry.
1,Very disappointing,"I loved The Amulet of Samarkand, but was really disappointed with this book. Bartimaeous was featured far too little, and the other characters just weren't that interesting. I found Nathaniel to be downright unlikeable."
3,From a Bartimaeus fan,Bartimaeus is the reason I got hooked on this series. He is still as funny as he was in the first book but unfortunately he plays a much smaller part in this book. Nathaniel has become very unlikable which is obviously the intention of the author to show how easily power and fame can corrupt even good hearted people. Kitty figures in this book greatly. She is an interesting character with a lot of depth and adds a slightly darker tone to the series. I found myself wishing that Kitty/Bartimaeus and Nathaniel/Bartimaeus were separate trilogies. It is still a satisfying read and I am looking forward to the conclusion.
5,Terrific,"This book definitely ranks among the best I've read. The dialogue and plot are both easy to understand. The characters have life and act realistic, generally. There are people I actually like( rare). It was funny and is great to re-read. I loved this book! I can't wait for the third book to come out."
4,"Intelligent Fantasy, but not really for kids","Stroud's series is not for people who like their fantasy simple. He lays out a complex multi-tiered world with good guys who aren't good, and bad guys who aren't all bad. The magic acts in the books are performed by a variety of demons and imps who are forced to do so at magicians' bidding, lest they be killed in punishment.This is the 2nd in the trilogy, and holds its own very well. I plowed through this book in two days, and am eager to read the third one. Highly recommended, but really, I don't think it's for children."
3,Great!,This book has some working to do if it will get anywhere in the book world. The book is so *&^%$#%^ en bad I never want to see it again
5,WOW,"Wow. That's the only word to describe it. This book was AMAZING! The Golem's Eye is is 3xs better than #1! Nathaniel (John Mandrake) starts working at parliament, and is doing very well until he is assigned to track dow the Resistance. Also there is the fact that there is a giant clay golem roaming around London! This book is told by Bartimaeus, Nathaniel, and Kitty. With nexpected twists and turns, this book deserves more than the 5 stars I gave it!!!!!"
3,Withholding judgment...,"I enjoyed the first book of the Bartimaeus Trilogy, but I have to admit to being disappointed in the second installment. Mr. Stroud receives high marks for a well-conceived world with a believable history (except for the bit about the Americas...not sure I buy the 'uninhabited wasteland'). Where his story fails is in his lack of likable characters. I found little to admire in any of the characters in this book, even Kitty, who was far and away my favorite. As many others have said, there is little sense of urgency about any of the events in the book, and I found myself looking forward to the bits narrated by Bartimaeus (even if it meant I had to put up with Nathaniel as well) simply to relieve the humdrum of the plot. Having said all that, there are hints that things will turn around in the final installment, and I will most likely read it--once the library gets a copy, that is."
1,Golem's Eye - Audio abridged,This was very disapointing. It is true I've probably read this book outloud to my kid three times - so I know it pretty well - but the abridgement cut out the favorite bits (how can one leave out Prague?) and we kept getting lost but not in the story because we couldn't figure out why we'd gone to that part.My kid used her birthday money for this purchase - and she's so disappointed that here I am getting the first one on cd for her. Really not a good job.
4,Another good tale,"I had thought that the first book was okay, so I picked up the second book, even though I groaned when I saw all the chapters narrated by Kitty when I first picked it up. Contrary to what most people are saying, I loved wincing at Nathaninel's nastiness and I personally found Bartimaeus to be funnier than in the first book. I liked the plot much better and even found myself eventually enjoying Kitty's sections. Overall, a great book. I like Nathaniel and Bartimaeus's relationship and can't wait to see how it evolves. I also find Bartimaeus's fondness for his previous master Ptlomey touching."
5,ordered as part of a set,"I was happy to find When You and I Were Young, Whitefish by Dorothy Johnson as I was putting together a set of books by Montana authors for a gift. Book arrived timely and in good condition."
3,Misfits of Science,"This so reminds me of the old show Misfits of Science from mid-80s. And if you haven't heard of it, look it up to see the similarities. A writer for Misfits later became the creator for Heroes.I'm glad Amazon has the Instant Video so I could catch an episode and check it out. $2 isn't a bad price for an afternoon's entertainment when the weather drives you inside."
5,Great,"First episode or two was a bit predictable, but, Wow, when it gets going, it gets going!! Most def worth it."
4,Great show,I absolutely love this show. I downloaded this to my kindle and was so happy that amazon had the episode I was missing on my dvr!
4,Interesting,It took a while for me to get interested & thought it would be a series I could read while I was watching but soon realized it had more of my attention than at first thought. Strathmore is always interesting & the general topic reminded me of another series I have seen in the past but the characters & their inner conflicts kept me from reading!
5,Well worth your time.,"Great acting, nice effects, and very well written episodes. I will continue to watch this series until they jump the shark."
1,One day they'll do this idea right on tv... not today,It's not a crazy concept. Fun super hero-y people fighting crime after being assemble by a government agency. But this lacked charm or good effects. Only watched the one episode. But I did watch the whole episode. I tried to like it.
3,"Good show, Familiar ideas","I've never seen the tv show Heroes but I'm guessing it's something like that, it's definitely got something of the X-Men feel to it though, the difference being these Alphas (mutants) have trade offs for their skills. The guy who fails horribly if he's pressured, the guy who is socially inept, the guy who can rage for 2 seconds before getting wore out. The story is interesting and some of the ideas are great, but the story line is quite original for the mutant vs human."
5,Interesting Plots and Character Interaction,"Only 3 episodes in, but I'm enjoying what I've seen so far. The Alpha conditions that the characters have (both the team and the ""rouges"") have interesting implications and enough pseudo-scientific explanations to make them fairly plausible. It's still science fiction, but a superpower that features pheromone emission is easier to swallow than, say, a man who can move planets.The interaction between the characters seems pretty believable to me - maybe a tad dramatic (this is entertainment, after all) but still human. The pacing is pretty good too - what I'd imagine a group of people from very different social environments trying to work together and slowly bonding over time.So far the latest episode (""Anger Management"") was the best in my opinion."
5,Best episode yet,"This episode gave fans two things we've been waiting to see for a while: Bill and Hicks fighting togehter, and then Bill and Hicks fighting each other. Neither fight dissapoints. Oh, the rest of the episode is satisfying as well, if a bit predictable. -Gary Wilkens"
2,What on earth is David Strathairn doing in this mediocre rehash of Heros.,"A very underwhelming series. Story lines are passable but the acting with the exception of Strathairn and some of the guest actors is really below par. Moreover, the music and camera work seem to be striving to cover for their lack of talent by overdoing it."
2,Comic book tv,"I was looking for something to watch after finishingBattlestar Galactica. This wasn't it. If you want tosee a Marvell comic serialized into a sort of MissionImpossible - Charlie's Angels mold, you might like this."
1,a great excuse to turn off the TV.,"The story-line is predictable,ordinary people living most of them in 700.000$ houses(an extremely ordinary price) with special superpowers helping the government (sounds familiar????); the characters seem more interested in representing sociological stereotypes than in being people; and the location is not very original (New York, New York,,,,,, again)The rest of the world wonder:"" are there any other cities in America?"": A great show for those who still feel some nostalgia from the 80's:"
2,Really Average,I am a bit over this type of series this seems like a bit of a rehash of Heroes with a government twist as it is I would have preferred they keep making Eureka why do Syfy cancel really good series and bring out crap
4,future social impact?,"Green furnishes an eloquent survey of modern computing. Not from the technical standpoint. He leaves that to others. But instead he concentrates on explaining possible future trends, that could impact you.Such topics like data mining and users' personal agents and the rise of various virtual communities. For the latter, we see glimmerings already in economic-oriented websites like eBay, or more general websites like craigslist. Or even in the massive multiplayer role playing domains. The latter may in fact be currently the most comprehensive virtual communities on the net. So he discusses what they might look like, decades hence."
2,not so good,"It came in 3 small rolls...I was expecting 1 longer roll,not 3 shorter ones...but I tried using it anyway..Didn't really work."
2,Why must they make things so difficult?,"Bought a number of these during a remodel for use in plaster ceilings. The plaster ring/ clip combo is terrible. Nearly impossible to get the clips to hide under the trim, even when cutting the clips. The retainer springs that hold the baffles are the worst I've seen, and barely hold the trim snug when installed. Terrible remodel cans. Two stars because they actually look nice when you manage to get them into the ceiling."
3,IT'S ALL IN THE STARS,"good side:lots of energy,great DVD footage,a definite live bandbad side:song list could have been a lot better, no songs sung by drummer Tre Coolstandout tracks:american idiot; jesus of suburbia,boulevard of broken dreams"
5,Does it Play on UK PSP,"Quality UMD, but does anyone know if this will Play on UK Region 2 Sony PSP's. Or will I need software to get round it like with my Sony PS2.Quality just bought it in the UK at Virgin Megasore for ?16.99. States it's for Region 2,3,4,5"
4,Great,"Amazing show. Only 4 stars because the cd is short and not having the whole live show on the cd or dvd. Other then that, it is great!"
5,Great CD and Concert!,"Great CD and concert, love it, it's like actually being there in person. Any Green Day fan would love this!"
3,average at best,not much to say about this other than the fact that it's full of annoying cuts where they go to backstage shots of the band talking about things...that would be okay if you weren't expecting a concert dvd.Also the fact that songs are cut from the show..and a few songs are cut from the cd...adds up to failure for being an amazing product.Might be a must have for any hardcore green day fan but I still don't own it and have essentially everything else they have put out. I don't have it because of the aforementioned sloppy job of piecing it together...
3,Green Day,"No doubt this dvd was very entertaining, getting to see them play a live show and all the interviews and other stuff...it was pretty cool. But I am personally very disapointed in them. Like first of all, they are no longer a 3-piece...they now have like 6 members in their band. Another thing is how they dress the same at like every live show...that is kinda dumb...it's like they are like following a label or something. Another thing is how they kinda changed their style..they aren't really that raw punk rock like they used to, they kinda sound like every other new punk band that's out there. And yet another thing is how they are like all political in their music writing these days. I liked the earlier green day days when all they wrote about was being bored and stuff like that. So it might be me, but I am very disapointed in them....I miss the good old green days...."
1,documentation of green day's worst tour ever,"basically, this cd/dvd is documentation of green day's sloppiest, all time low, and over all worst tour ever. with the addition of so many band members onstage, why, i wonder, do billie mike and tre play sloppier? on this tour, mike misses many backing vocals, billie's guitar playing is at an all time sloppiness (embarassing for such an amazing guitarist). also, billie's guitar sounds are TERRIBLE, why can't he make his les paul juniors as powerful as they sound on the recordings? anyways, about this cd/dvd: it's nothing more than a handpicked selection of the most overplayed songs from the tour (their ""greatest hits"") with the banter completely cut out. it is very very dissapointing coming from a band who used to put on an amazing energetic live show. but.... if you are a new fan to the band or are young and stupid, then you will probably love this cd/dvd."
1,Yeah! This is great!,"Alright! Green Day! My favorite ambiguous emo-punk-pop disaster's still as popular as ever, luckily. I just love this live DVD. A jewel case? Man, that works so well with the faux-melancholic nature of ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" and others. This DVD is superb, I just cherish every moment of a grade school dropout strutting around in a king's crown. I've always dreamed of listening to guitar and vocal studio overdubs to compensate for lack of real talent. Green Day delivers!!An American guy bellowing ""ENGLAND!!"" every two seconds in a British accent? That proves Green Day aren't posers.Furthermore, Green Day's audience is a very open-minded and intelligent lot. As one reviewer proudly proclaimed, ""if u think this cd sucks then u suck.[sic]""Boy, Green Day fans can offer some real intellectual stimulation."
1,AWFUL LIVE CD,"This live album sucks! I mean what is all this singing by the audience? I mean it is a really bad Green Day compilation. And I've always never liked live because they scream, yell, & clap.If you want a good concert album...I recommend you to purchase Dire Straits On The Night. It has none of that!!!!!!!!!!! Plus it was probably the greatest show on EARTH! It will rock your talent great. Stay away from this junk. Buy the other albums by this great band insted."
1,OLDER,"Green Day Was My Favorite Band!!American Idiot wasn't that goodBullet in a bible is horrible...As Green Day gets older, They SUCK!!!Billie Joe Had A MUCH MUCH MUCH better voice when he was younger!UGH!!!"
1,Sound quality is terrible,Great band.The sound quality on this product is terrible.Sounds like they made it in a garage.Find another of their products to buy.
5,Just like being there,"I had the good fortune to attend the American Idiot concert in Houston. Believe me, this video makes you feel like you were there, only with a better close-up view of the band. The way they cut the video together is awesome, and makes it very sexy and flashy. The interviews with the band are fun, but there isn't very much time spent on that, and I would have liked to see more of the behind the stage action. Some of the interviews with the fans are hilarious. Mostly, this video is just great rocking music and well worth the investment."
4,very good collection of green day songs,"i love this CD and DVD. all the songs are great, and the director of the DVD is very talented. not only does it have the concert, but it also has interviews with people in the concert. because of this, it felt like i was actually at the concert! on the dvd, it even has a button to see a photo gallery! in all, green day is a great band and after watching this DVD/CD, it has increased my respect for them. the only thing i could say is that i wish they had more songs from their ""american idiot"" album, like give me novocaine, etc. Another one, from the International superhits CD that i wish they had was ""Good Riddance(Time of your Life"". if it had those songs, then it would be a perfect 5."
1,mtv trash,"Yeah, i don't see how anyone can like this garbage and it's really starting to get old. nasal vocals, weak rifts. at least they used to try."
5,very good,"When I read the reviews for this before I had a chance to get out, I was very nervous that I would be dissapointed. However, I was very happy with it. I, like many others, was dissapointed that they cut songs out (especially She). I did not find the interviews annoying. I thought they were interesting, and did not lose the rush. As soon as the next song started I was right back into it. One thing I did find slightly annoying was the filming from behind Green Day and a lot and switching to black and white. That, to me, took the momentum away more than the interviews...because it felt like you were falling out of the concert. They were making it obvious that you were not there by switching to black and white.The CD part is awesome. I love live versions of songs, because you get the feeling of how special the moment is. Billy lets the crowd sing a lot of parts and that sounds so awesome to meAll in all, it is great!"
3,"Go, Stop, Go, Stop","I felt so much energy when the concert started, but the in between interviews just did not allowed me to enjoy the concert.Audio sound is good , and the band is tight in this concert."
3,Don't Bite the Bullet cause the Bullet bites,"If you are a die-hard fan don't read this review... you've already bought the CD-DVD and will keep it no matter what. Plenty of other people have talked about the DVD but let's just focus on the CD here. I consider myself a Green Day fan. American Idiot, Nimrod, Dookie... genius, but this concert CD is pretty lousy. It's pretty much a regurgitation of American Idiot's best with plenty of extra f-bombs sprinkled in to get some big screams. That coupled with Billy Joe constantly yelling ""England"" and renouncing his US citizenship was pretty weak for audience interactment. They pull out only seven other songs from previous CDs. That's lame for a live album. I hoped this one would be one of those classic concert CDs like U2's ""Under a Blood Red Sky"", The Who's ""Live at Leeds"", or Peter Gabriel's ""Secret World Live"" but it's not. The studio albums have all of the energy you'll want so buy those before you buy this."
4,Pretty good overall,"This is a DVD of one of Green Day's first stadium shows ever, and it comes with a CD of all the songs too. Interspliced with the footage are interviews with all the dudes and some short clips of them doing funny stuff and touring a war museum.If you like Green Day's live show, you will like this DVD, and it definitely captures the essence/power/emotion of the event. They play the songs well, but Billie Joe runs around doing the whole rock star ""HEYYYY, HOOOOOO..."" thing. I'm not so into that. The interviews offer some pretty good insights, but then again, there is some more rock star posturing mixed in there.Anyway, I liked this DVD/CD combo, and I recommend it to Green Day fans. It's pretty good overall."
1,Green Day...You Don't Make Good Music Anymore...Quit It!,"You know, the fact that 95% of Green Day's fans these days are 9 year old girls is pretty disturbing, I can name so many bands that are better than Green Day, but the list would be so long it would take up a whole page. Green Day's new stuff in particular stuff, and they were never that good to begin with. Want punk, stick to Suicidal Tendencies?P.S.- Why has GD decided to go emo and wear eyeliner"
1,Don't Like.,"Only one song I liked, Wake Me Up When September Ends,Why you may ask? I acualy barrowed the CD from my friend. I hated it. Why do they use such lyrics? Is it really helpful? I dowright hate this CD beside the one song, and the title just hurts me even more."
1,bullet in a butt,I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think green day is a wannabe. I think he needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to paint glasses green and view the day green. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough
1,England!!!,"Okay whatever, shut the hell up.What a horrendous live album, more commercial crap from this so called ""band"". this is the death toll ringing for Green Days music and the beginning of more commercialised money making junk and scams.Total sellouts."
1,big fat loser drummer,i went to see green day about a month ago and the drummer tre cool threw a drum stick at me and it hit my eye now i have to wear this gay patch thingy on it and cream it once an hour. thanks alot tre cool you aren't cool. i spit in the face of people who don't like to be cool.
4,Great music!,"This is a good collection of classic big band swing music. If you're looking for some old-school Glenn Miller type music, this is it. If you want some more modern swing music, like Maynard Ferguson, then look at different albums. This is great old-fashioned big band music. Don't be confused by the title, Jungle Swing isn't like the 70s song 'Jungle Boogie'A good buy for good music.~C~"
2,"Literally, a literal translation of the Spiritual Exercises","This book, though good for one who is trying to make sense and meaning of the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola in contemporary language, is not for people who are seeking to gain knowledge about being directed or directing the Spiritual Exercises, or what they are, or how Scriptures could be prayed over imaginatively, or what ""dynamics"" mean in relation to the Spiritual Exercises. This book is literally a commentary of the Spiritual Exercises in modern language and is not general reading material to get ""technical"" know-how of how the Exercises are done. Buy this book if you want to do an academic study of the Exercises. A reference book I would call it."
4,"Good content, poor presentation","This is an excellent book on the basics of media training. If you want to learn the basic skills of getting your PR message, this book will teach you them. However, the ebook itself is a structural mess: the index is broken and it is virtually impossible to navigate effectively, other than simply page-to-page. Further, some individual pages have poor layout. These technical flaws don't detract from the content, but impair the book's total utility."
3,Cute Catholic Culture book,"Bill Dodds, a well-known American Catholic humorist, captures good Catholic satire with his book, ""How To Be a Catholic Mother."" It has been said that, in order to be well-adjusted, one must be able to laugh at one's self. That certainly is the case with this book. Many Catholics will see themselves in Dodds' pages, which give instruction on how to properly swear as a Catholic (with a list of permissable words), proper Catholic organizations, how to deal with parish personages (even if Jesus himself asked for the keys to get into the church, the parish secretary would insist on accompanying him to the door, and would ask him to please carry over that stack of next month's missalettes). And, who could forget the chapter, ""A good Catholic is a fat Catholic?"" Lighthearted humor and a must for all Catholic families."
5,"Swinging, melodic and inventive","Great work by Steve Herberman and group. Steve's playing is fresh and inventive, he sounds like himself, you don't hear cliches. Always swinging and melodic. I'm particularly fond of ""Laura"" and ""Thought Lines"", but the whole disc is very good."
3,Missing Track I Love So Much,"I Am So Please To Finally See That This is On CD. I've Been Longing For Modern Romance To Be Put On CD, But Was Dissapointed To See That ""Can You Move"" Was Not Included. I Have The Singles For It. WHY!!!!!!"
3,A nice collection of early 80s Brit pop for fans of Trevor Horn/ABC,"Nice to have all the DOLLAR pop hits on one low-price CD, including the sublime throwaway pop of MIRROR MORROR and HANDHELD IN BLACK & WHITE - aside from those two songs, there really isn't much to recommend, but the liner notes are insightful, and many tracks were produced by TREVOR HORN (ABC, BUGGLES, FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD, GRACE JONES, et al.) - in fact, it's rumored that MARTIN FRY of a very early ABC hear Trevor-produced hits by Dollar and flipped so much he asked him to produce their debut, LEXICON OF LOVE - the rest is history. Essentially, a one-hit wonder stretched out to ""best of"" length with rare extended mixes/demos, this is for completists only."
1,Not even close,"Would give it half a star. Sadly this and many ""GOLD"" releases never consider the true fans. It's Natures Way? We Walked In Love? Perhaps this is for people that have a 3.5 minute attention span."
3,Not as good as the first season,I was really disapointed with the golden girls second season because it wasen't as funny as the first also there are no special features.
4,Still solid gold,"Season Two may not have the snap that Season One did, but there are many golden episodes in this set. The ""Empty Nest"" pilot amazes me in that it even got sold! It was forced, unfunny and the chemistry just wasn't right with the cast of the pilot. The series worked however after major surgery -- and Richard Mulligan in the lead. The ""extras"" on ""The Golden Girls"" have been terrible. Volume One had Joan Rivers and her daughter. Those shrill, shallow hags are so annoying! And the trivia quiz on Volume Two was absolutely boring. What I wouldn't give for a blooper reel or unaired scenes!"
5,Season 2 - The Best There Is,"I think Season 2 of GG really hit its stride. Season 1 got us all accustomed to the characters and allowed the characters to develop. Seasons 3 & 4 really allow the characters to appear 'in the round', and the result is 3 more seasons of absolutely perfect sitcom hilarity. This series show us that shows like ""Cheers"", ""Maude"", ""Mama's Family"" and ""Designing Women"" are equivalent to ""Scooby-Doo"", when it comes to situation comedy and topics that should be addressed. First timers, check out ""Ladies Of The Evening"", ""Joust Between Friends"" & ""To Catch A Neighbor""."
5,Great Buy!!,"I bought Golden Girls. Season 2 used, I was kinda nervous about it buying used but I thought what the heck. It arrived right on time! Earlier than I expected! All discs looked new! Great buy!!!!!!"
5,Love the Golden Girls,I love the set I have finally watched the 1st season and the second season now and I am hoping to order the other 5 soon.
5,nakia,I love my golden Girls DVD and i will love the golden thank you thank thank you i am watch is right now
4,"Season 2, not the best of all 7 , but definately a gem","I bought season 1 of the Golden Girls in December and it was great! I watched it on TV a lot and now it's finally on DVD! Season 1 had to be one of the best seasons, in my opinion. Season 2 was great too, but there were more memorable episodes on the first season. I like every golden girls episode, and season 2 has some very entertaining episodes, no doubt. I can't wait till it comes out already. It's gonna be fun adding another twenty-something episodes to my collection. Can't wait for seasons 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It'll be forever until those come out! But at least I'll have 1 and 2 until the rest are released."
2,2 and a half stars at best,"sorry to say but this is not a 5 star show as most other people would have you believe. the humour is tired,the writing is weak and the mother is annoying. the saving grace of the show is of course Bea Arthur. when MAUDE is finally on DVD,then you will really see Arthur at her best.again Golden Girls is no classic but is good for a few chuckles."
5,Still GOLDEN!!!!,"I Am Thrilled To Have This Wonderfully Funny Second Season On Dvd!!! So Many Great Episodes...""End Of The Curse"", ""The Actor"", ""Ladies Of The Evening"" & ""To Catch A Neighbor""!!! The Only Drawback Is The LAME Trivia Challenge...Please If You Can't Do Better Than This...Don't Bother!!!!! The GIRLS Deserve Better & So Do Their Fans!!!!!"
5,Love This Show,"This ultimately became part of a gift to my sibling. I love this series also, so I was tempted to keep it for myself!"
5,Best Mother Daugher time!,I always watched this with my mother when i was younger and now that im across the country from her i sometimes like to watch it to feel like im closer to her.
5,It's About Time!!!,I have been waiting forever for the Golden Girls TV series to come out on DVD. I enjoyed watching Golden Girls when it originally aired and I enjoy watching reruns of Golden Girls but to be able to watch them anytime of day or night how awesome is that!!! I love all the great personalities of the Golden Girls and how they interacted and how they related to subjects that affected a lot of people and did it in a wonderful and tasteful manner. I can hardly wait for the remaining seasons to come out on DVD. I will definitely be buying the rest of the seasons.
2,Great show... poor quality DVD recording.,I'm a huge fan of the Golden Girls series. I ordered the entire series from Amazon and have been extremely disappointed with the poor quality of the DVD recording. The picture is not clear and seems to be either a pirated recording or copied with poor technology. I feel jipped that the show I love the most is not enjoyable to view with such poor quality recording.
5,Golden Girls second season,"I am a huge fan of the Golden Girls Show and so is my 83 year old Mother. I have the First & Second seasons on DVD now and looking forward to adding to them.We love watching these great shows and laughing over and over....they NEVER get ""old""."
2,"Long, Repetitive and Bland","I find this book, though filled with decent (not excellent) content to be very long and bland. The author continually repeats himself within chapters, extending the length and making it almost confusing to follow, not reinforcing. This is not exciting, neither in writing style nor content."
2,Remixed versions,"These are not the original classics. The producers have remixed to add extra percussion, a thumpa-thumpa/hip hop bass and slowed several of the songs down so the original Motown sound is lost with some songs sounding particularly heavy and dragging."
4,Motown Classics Gold,"I needed a Motown CD for a prize basket which was supposed to be focused on Michigan. The CD arrived quickly, within plenty of time for the event. This had been a concern as the idea of a Motown CD was a last minute suggestion. It was in great shape and the price was lower than comparable CDs."
3,Remastered?,"There's a great selection of tunes, but they sound the same as they did on the radio 40 years ago. I fiddled with my stereo's tuners to make sure they were set properly, but couldn't get a crisp, clean sound."
5,"UP, UP, & I'm Carried AWAY!","Shania is once again successful in entertaining her fans in this new DVD, UP! IT's a muct have for any Shania fan, and a must watch to anyone who is not familiar with her (where have you been?). Everyone will certainly come away a fan after reviewing this video. The video actually makes you feel you are one among the crowd at this her awe inspiring concert of her best hits. This one will definatly get you UP! and moving!"
5,SHANIA<SHANOZEL,"Shania is once again successful in entertaining her fans in this new DVD, UP! IT's a muct have for any Shania fan, and a must watch to anyone who is not familiar with her (where have you been?). Everyone will certainly come away a fan after reviewing this video. The video actually makes you feel you are one among the crowd at this her awe inspiring concert of her best hits. This one will definatly get you UP! and moving!"
5,Your Heart will Skip a Beat!,From the moment I turn on the dvd player I was in Shania Heaven. She starts off with Man I. Feel Like A. Woman! And your heart just skips a beat. The way Shania moves around stage and down into the crowd you know she's a woman who knows how to put on a show. No doubt in my mind once this dvd starts you will not be picking up that remote until the end of the show.
4,See what you are missing,This DVD is an absolute must for any Shania fan. Shania has had an impressive carreer so far and she is not slowing down. After watching this DVD you will run out to see Shania live next time she comes around. A lot of artists can make a decent CD but it takes real talent to put on a live show as awesome as Shania does. If you haven't then you HAVE to see what your missing!
5,Diva,"This is Shania at her best!!! Her music is energizing, and insprirational and it is always such a pleasure to watch her perform live!! I only wish that I could've been there to watch it myself, but having this DVD is the next best thing. ""She's not just a pretty face"" and Yes, Shania Twain has everything it takes!!! Enjoy a good time with one of country's greatest ""divas"" ... Shania Twain"
5,a winning package,on this dvd u have one of the most beautiful women with in my opinoin the greatest voice in country music today live in concert and unlike going to a live concert where you pay watch it 1 time you can watch it over andover and with shania in it youll want to watch it till u wear it out what ever this dvd cost its worth every penny and i give it 5 stars
5,Two Thumbs UP! for Shania !,THe DVD brings across the excitement & power of Shania's live performances ! A must have for any music fan - country or pop ! Shania brings mixure of her new hits & old favorites. Wonderful DVD !
5,UP UP & AWAY !,"Shania definately gives her all in this LIVE performance ! Filmed in the Windy City Shania takes the breath away from her wide fan base ! Mixing our favorites with songs from her 4th album, Shania makes everyone happy ! Would be a wonderful gift for any Shania fan !"
4,up! is awesome,first i want to say shania is amazing. second this dvd is awesome. anyone who wants to truely be entertained must get thisdvd. it has shania performing live all of her hits 22 in all. shania just keeps belting out hit after hit. she keeps you entertained the whole time .
4,Shania is UP,This dvd is amazing. She sings great on it and performs well. Everyone should go and get this dvd now. I love it and can't stop watching it since I got it!
5,Shania Twain - Up (Live in Chicago),"This is a excellant DVD, something like two hours of Shania Twain at her best, her counrty /pop style of music along with her charismatic stage presence, makes this DVD and concert a must have for any Shania Twain fan. 22 preformances along with some fan interaction surprizes, make the two hour or so showvery entertaining. Old Shania to new Shania you get it all herein a way that only Shaina can deliver it.I saw the ""UP"" tour here in St.Louis, it was in the round, this concert is on a large stage, so it will slightly different formthe offical tour, but a awesome concert none the less.I highly recommend this entertaining DVD."
5,Wonderful music!!,"I bought this on a whim after reading some reviews. I'd never listened to much of Shania Twain, but I must say I am a convert. I just finished listening to the DVD for the second time in 24 hours and am on my way to pick up additional titles. It's easy to see why she's so popular. So-so audio, but the quality of the video and music easily earns this DVD 5 stars. Like others, I also wish there were a Shania commentary.For anyone who likes Shania Twain, this is a must-have."
5,Awesome DVD,I purchased the DVD and it is great.If you have never seen Shania live this DVD will make you want to go to a concert.It makes you feel as if you're at the show.With Christmas UP this will make any Shania fan happy.
5,Awesome Shania DVD,"Shania DVD is awesome. If you like to watch Shania in concert, then this DVD is a must have. This is the concert special she had earlier this summer that was shown on tv. DVD includes several more songs that weren't included on that special. A must have for any Shania fan."
5,WOW! What a dvd!,Whether you were at the Chicago show or not what better way to experience this concert then on the dvd. Unlike some performers Shania doesn't lip-synch she sings every note herself. The energy of the band is incredible. The costume changes. Lots of audience shots. Definitely a dvd you want to add to your growing collection.
5,As amazing on screen as it was live!,This concert DVD brings you right into the action. It's just like being at the concert!
5,"Love it, Love it, did i say i loved it?","I just have to say that i love ths dvd!!! It shows how much energy she has and gives her all to the audience! I can't wait to see her in concert Dec. 13th. It will be so awesome, and all I have to do to get ready is watch this DVD and dance and sing along and I feel like I am already at the concert......oh did I mention I love this DVD???????"
4,Get UP Now,Go and get this DVD now. It is totally awesome. She is one of the best performers out there. She totally deserves all the awards she wins and this show proves that she can sure sing!
5,Like the flower,"Shania is like her favorite flower on stage the ""wild rose"". She changes from a quite person to one who is all over the stage. In this DVD you get to see the other side of Shania and that is the one of a women alive in her music and her voice is just outstanding. The new songs are fun and serious but done with only the excellent voice that Shania could bring to them."
5,A pleasure to see and hear,Shania Twain has reached the top of her profession and this DVD shows that she is at the very top. One of the most endearing trade marks about Shania that comes through in this DVD is her quailty of being a down to earth real person. One of us so to speak. She shows this in the DVD by the way she acts on stage and how she interacts with the fans. It adds a real friendly quialty that just makes this DVD that much better.
5,Shania sets the stage,With 22 hits Shania sets the stage. This is a high energy show like no other. At times to some it may appear like Shania would rather be somewhere else. I truly believe that what your seeing is a woman who is dtermined to put on a great show. Shania knew at the time this was going to be a special on NBC as well as sold on dvd. If you were at the show you'll probably see yourself. Definitely a must for any Shania fan!
5,Shania So Sexy In This DVD,Shania Twain is a beautiful and talented women who believes in herself and her ability. This DVD shows us all just how talented a women she is. The songs are great ones from the past and absolute blow outs for new songs. You add that with the beauty she has and her caring for her fans and you have the best female singer there is. This DVD is great and one for the books and your DVD collection
5,A Great Chirstmas Gift,"What could be better than rushing downstairs on Xmas morning and unwrapping your very own copy of Shania Twain's Up Live in Chicago DVD? This is the best gift anyone could hope to receive. So for those of you who have a Shania fan to shop for, don't disappoint, get them this DVD."
5,Shania Up in Chicago DVD,"This DVD is a must buy for yourself and a great gift for a friend. I was at the concert and the DVD really captures the spirit and energy of a live Shania show. 2+ hours of great music by a great singer/songwriter with the best back up band in music today. Not a dull moment nor a bad song, and the DVD includes several songs that were cut to fit the concert in the time slot they had when it aired on TV."
5,Shania Twain rocks Chicago!,Shania fans are going to enjoy this DVD! She sings all of her hits and some new songs from the UP album that she performs live in this Chicago concert only. The pyro technics are awesome. She is so interactive with her audience that she even invite a few fans to sing/dance on stage with her. A must have!
5,Non-stop Entertainment!,Non-stop entertainment from start to finish! Scenes of fans will have you eager to get concert tickets to go to a show and see first hand all the fun. Some of the best moments are on stage with Shania and the Fabulous Falls that's her bands name in case you didn't know. Extremely Entertaining! The pyro tech's are a delight! What a show! Get this dvd!
5,Must Have for the music fan,This is an super DVD. Shania is a great performer and I recommend this to any music fan!
5,Nowhere but UP for Shania!,"Being from San Diego, CA, I couldn't be there for Shania's Live in Chicago performance. However, this is the next best thing! Her performance was AWESOME! If you haven't already picked up a copy for yourself, I'm sure there's a Shania fan on your Christmas list that would love one! They won't be disappointed!"
5,UP live in chicago,"Shania sings all her hits in this explosive dvd that would be a great gift for the holidays. only 3 songs from her woman in me album though, but come on over and up she sings most all of the singles and more."
5,Up & Running,"After a brief hiatus of creating a family and working on new songs with her ellusive husband, Mutt, Shania has come back strong,both vocally and lyrically. And she hasn't skimped on the entertainment factor either. In fact, Shania seems to be almost basking in her newfound live show lights on this DVD, titled, UP! Respectively so titled UP! with it's upbeat attitude it certainly reflects on the listener/viewer as well. Watch and your attitude will be uplifted too. Enjoy!!"
5,Shania the one and only,Shania is the one and only person who can preform the songs and the interaction on this DVD. I know many others can and do sing and interact really well but Shania has reached a higher plain and has reached the place above a Diva or super star. If she continues to grow even her distracters will have to admit that she is one of if not the best singer preformer. This DVD is an excellent highlight of just how good she is. It brings to the front all of her talent and ability. She is a great singer preformer and like I said this DVD shows it.
5,Shania's DVD,Shania's sultry voice is enough reason to buy this dvd. The other reasons Shania's never ending energy. The way Shania interacts with her band and brings the crowd into each song she sings. One of the best moments is when for Thank You Baby! Shania brings in an orchestra to back her up. Just as Shania fans will say Shaniariffic!
5,Shania at her best!,"Shania Twain is at her absolute best during this performance! If you are a Shania Fan this dvd is a MUST have! I have not been fortunate enough yet to attend one of her shows, but You can bet, I will as soon as she makes her way to my area. Shania is so energentic, and boy is she singing from the bottom of her heart and soul! You can really tell her love for her fans, by her interactions with them! Can you imagine if you were there at this show, not only do you see one heck of a performance, but you also end up on her live DVD!"
2,Sound is horrible,"I bought this DVD because all of the previous reviews I read said this was one of the best of Shania Twain. The live concert is great, but the acoustics are horrible. I could hardly hear Shania singing. I wish it would have had better quality, & had been sound recorded a lot better."
4,Great music/Beautiful person,"I really enjoyed this concert. All of Shanias ""UP"" CD songs are on this. Good music. Plus I really dig how Shania gets in touch with her audience. It makes me want to go see her in concert."
5,Shania Twain UP Live in Chicago DVD,"Shania Twain is as good as it gets as a singer, writer and composer. This DVD of her concert in Chicago in 2003 is spectacular. She is at her best. Her energy is only surpassed by her beauty.This concert represented her first stage appearance in three years. If you are a Shania fan buy it; you will not be disappointed."
4,Shania,"I have liked Shania Twain's voice and ability since her Come On Over CD. I always find music more interesting when you can watch the singer or orchestra when they perform. I regret that I have not had the opportunity to be present at a live concert. She is also talented and puts on a very entertaining performance. I like her band, the huge stage and her interaction with the audience. I would have given this concert five stars but I have to agree with one of the other reviews that commented on the fact that the camera shots changed to rapidly and did not stay with any one person or instrument but just for a second of two. But that does not take away from her music, writing and performing. For those points I would give the DVD five stars."
3,"Great show, but...","First of all, I do like Shania Twains music - it's catchy & fun, but not too deep & meaningful.In this concert, Shania again proves that she can indeed sing (in case there were still any doubters), & both she & her band do a great job.Why then do I only give it 3 stars?The whole thing is just a little too slick & soulless. It's massively overproduced, & I'm left with the feeling that the whole thing was gone over with a magnifying glass to make sure that it fit the image that Twain & her team wanted to project.Nothing seems spontaneous, & even Shania's pulling kids out of the audience seems carefully staged. I was left with the feeing that I was watching an overly long music video, not a live performance."
4,Hot and Hotter,"She gets hot and hotter each time around. This time, she showcases her live performance in this great, amazing dvd. This is a must-have, so get your copy now!"
2,How can people be so biased?,"How can people be so biased thowasrds a star? I'm not questioning the quality of Shania's reppertoire and skill. No. I'm giving it two stars because of the appearance of a ""cheap"" and rushed product this DVD have.How can it be possible that, in the DVD era, Shania release a DVD with absolutely NONE extras, no bonus material, no backstage footage, no interviews, there is not even the names of the band members at the final credits. Incredible! THis, of course, its typical example of an artist (no, I mean a record company or manager) that knows that its artist reached a level of fidelity from his fans that he can release any kind of product and it will sell."
5,A Must-Have,"Shania Twain's Chicago DVD is a must-have for every Shania fan. Great music, fantastic performance and non-stop fun is what this DVD is all about. Anyone who considers themselves to be a Shania fan must add this to their collection."
4,Get it now,This dvd is so worth getting. Each song is great and the live performances are a killer. She nails each song and looks fantastic. Please buy this dvd and be a fan.
5,Go to a Show!,Non-stop entertainment from start to finish! Scenes of fans will have you eager to get concert tickets to go to a show and see first hand all the fun. Some of the best moments are on stage with shania and the fabulous falls. Extremely Entertaining! You'll want to go to a Shania show to see for yourself!
5,Shania knows how to ROCK this country!,Shania's Chicago DVD is her best work by far! She puts on an awesome performance and empowers her fans everywhere!
4,Xmas Present,You have to get this DVD for a family or a friend this Xmas. It is filled with great performances and Shania looks great! It is a good buy for any music lover!
5,Awesome!,This DVD is AWESOME! Dont hesitate to buy this DVD because its a must have for any Shania fan!
5,Shania Keeps Going Up!,This DVD is an absolute must for any Shania fan. Shania has had an impressive carreer so far and she is not slowing down. After watching this DVD you will run out to see Shania live next time she comes around. A lot of artists can make a decent CD but it takes real talent to put on a live show as awesome as Shania does. I usually don't bother with videos because I prefer to see an artist live but if you have already seen Shania live this DVD will revitalize those memories. If you haven't then you HAVE to see what your missing!
5,Shania's UP Live in Chicago DVD,I've been a Shania fan for quite some time now. I received her UP Live in Chicago DVD as a birthday gift this year and couldn't be happier! This would make a great Christmas gift for any Shania fan!
2,If You Have Seen One Shania Show...,"...you have seen it all. Shania has not grown as a recording artist and she has not grown as a live performer, either. Basically, she is doing the samething she did during her 98-99 tour. The only thing different is her outfits (which are uglier) and she added some new songs (from her UP! album). But other than that, nothing is different...nothing improved...nothing changed. I will give her credit for her energy and she sounds pretty good. But I expect an artist of her level to give me more (especially after selling 30 million off her last cd and taking a long vacation). This show was a BIG bore. Buy the Dixie Chicks's Top of the World dvd and cd instead."
1,Country ain't country no more,Shania delivers an all-pop performance that proves she no longer believes in country music!
1,Why is she a star?,"This critique doesn't allow minuses or this would be a huge one, minus infinity. Her music is bland. She is a twit. She is fake country and gives the genre a bad name. The music industry is in trouble because of so-called artists like Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, Brittany Spears and the like."
5,performer she is,Shania shines as she shows her skills and talents as an artist and performer. She radiates through the entirity of this DVD titled UP! A must for any Shania fan.
5,Shania is the Best,"Hi All,I had the pleasure of seeing Shania's concert live in Chicago. Even though my family and I had seats pretty far back, her stage presence was phenominal! (the huge screens helped a lot too!) I'm buying this DVD to watch and remember the fantastic time we had watching one of the best female country music singers~ever!A note about the music in the concert; she sang many of her songs from UP! and several of her past hits too. My 14 year old daughter was THRILLED when Shania sang several of her favorite songs, 'Rock this Country' and 'Honey I'm home'. I recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys great country music and a fantastic concert."
1,Not worth it!,The video and audio are horrible. Stick with Bonanza videos made by Republic Pictures for excellent quality video and the original theme song.
5,BONANZA--What Else Is There To Say?,You can't go wrong with any videos of Bonanza. It was a series that was decent (as opposed to anything on the TV these days!)with good values taught.
2,Disappointed,"Video and audio were not very good at all,picture was not clear and had alot of flucuation in the audio."
5,Fast Delivery,"Thanks for te fast delivery. I ordered them for my mother in law, who will be 86 in February."
2,poor sound quality,I listened to this disk twice before deciding to discard it due to extremely dull sound engineering.
5,Oh My Gawww,"Let me tell you. There is a space where the music fills our lives perfectly and speaks to us in ways we just can't fully comprehend. So well, in fact, our lives are changed. Maybe it's a small alteration or maybe a complete renovation, but regardless it's a matter not fully understood. Music encompasses all that we do. It's everywhere and in everything. This album does a great job of filling those gaps and instigating those changes. Real fresh clean melodies and harmonies to boot combined with strong simple lyrics make this album truly enjoyable. Nate & James get my vote."
5,"awsome, inspiring, great sound, love it!","Nate & Jame have a great sound, and even greater lyrics. I find their songs so worshipful, and a great way to start out the day. I have even used some of their songs & lyrics to challenge the young people I work with. These guys are great! (hi guys!)"
5,Word is Born!,"An overflow of props to Nate and James on this album. This junk is tight, no doubt. I use to hear them practicing in the stairwell next to my dormroom in college, and they haven't changed a bit. Quality guitar strumming from Sickle, and the Thrilla's harmonization is right on point. The best of all is the consistent praise they give to the Lord. It's the ultimate LIFT on the way to work. Thank You."
3,It was a good book but something is wrong about it.,This book was outstanding I give it a b+ it also had down falls. The book needed more charicters and Perry should have cut back on all those un need swares. There were alot of incomplete sentances. All in all it was great
2,While A great read the ending took the horror out.,"Berserker had what every good Alien story should, it will really pull any fan of the first two movies way in to the thick of the situations and have you grasping for breath. Ultimitly though it falls way short of bringing closure to the story."
1,What a dissapointment,"It's too bad that the alien series has to be disscraced by such an auful comic. No series or true aliens fan will buy this piece of trash. I'd give it 0 stars if I could, Nevermind that, negative 5 stars would be best."
5,Aliens Berserker,"Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. I have read all nine of the Alien side story books. How about volunteering to wear a Facehugger. That was an intense story. It pains me that Alien Resurrection did not draw more from these types of story lines. I would love it if there where more. If there are any more of these books, some one please let me know where."
3,A Good Alien Gone Bad,"The begining and middle of the book was good, but I found that the ending was disappointing. I also didnt like the fact that it only had about six characters in it. It had a good amount of action and horror, but wasnt as good as I had hoped, guess it was that ending."
1,Terrible,One of the worst movies Ive seen in a very long time. The acting was terrible (sorta expected that)but the fighting was bad also and far and few fighting scenes in between. It seemed more like a Chinese soap opera than a Kung Fu movie. I don't recommend this movie to any action fighting fan.
4,A soul-searching novel,"This first novel by July Brady is a wonderful surprise. From despair and hopelessness, we are taken hand to hand to hope and dreams that come true, but not win with a snap but with hard work. Nola is a young woman in the wrong relationship, that uses her dreams as a way to escape our dreadful reality. There she has an beautiful unisus (half unicorn, half pegasus) and a wonderful and understanding Prince Charming. But what she didn't know was that what she thought were just fancies, was as real as the world we live. But of course, there is a threat that only she and other people like her, the Creators, can stop.This is a novel to read and read again to get all different meanings. It is amazing also, that this novel comes from the writer own lucid dreaming.I really recommend it."
4,Nice inexpensive remote,"I got the remote as a Fathers' Day present. I had no difficulty setting it up using the Logitech Website. I have a fairly obscure DVD player (RJTech) but Logitech had it in their database. I did have a bit of a problem in tweaking it to work EXACTLY as I wanted but a quick call to Logitech's free tech support hotline and after a few tries the tech had my remote working just perfectly. It WAS a little cumbersome to work through but someone with fairly limited computer skills should have it up and working in a very short time. This $40 unit made me put aside a $100 Sony universal remote never (hopefully) to be used again. Now my wife can actually use my home entertainment system without my help. (I GUESS that's a good thing. ;)Buy it, but only if you can get it for under 50 bucks. You won't be disappointed!"
3,Having Fun with This one So Far,"I ended up with 4 of these units.My Mother In Law loves that she can now watch a DVD in her own home with out help and now at my house too.I like that I can do away with a collection of remotes.Customer service was able to help me figure out how to control 2 TiVo's in the same room with in 24 hours of sending them and e-mail.Nice feature is advanced set up...For us TiVo families this means with a one button push the TV is turned on and the list menu for the TiVo is shown, not live TV (important for the NASCAR fan who likes to watch behind time).I have had mine set up for a few days and I keep thinking of advanced things I want to do, my wife thinks I am a loon.At less than $[...] it was a steal.The fact that I cannot make it RF with the kit from Weaknees.com is what will keep it from being 5 stars, but I will investigate other wireless RF kits."
3,Fair,"This remote is OK; however, it is missing some of the basic buttons that are on other Harmoney 600 series remotes such as ""Exit"", ""Advance"", and ""Replay"" as well as the separate ""Sound"" & ""Pic"" menu buttons. I purchased it as a replacement for Harmony 620 that lost a button when my dog broke it and thought that it would be an easy swap out. I was wrong and had to do a complete reprogram. Other than that its OK"
5,"Great product, great pricing","This is an amazing product. It is so easy to setup. It knows the controls of 5 out of my 6 electronic components, and learns the 6th one easily. I just want to get few more of this.Just a small hickup; During the setup through the internet, in case of a remote control that is not in Logitech database, the personal firewall, on my computer, blocks the information that is sent to Logitech web site. Neither Logitech software nor the firewall warns the user about this. By guessing, I had it go through by disabling the firewall for a short period of time."
4,It works for all of my equipments.,"Yes, it can control all of my equipments. But there is one little thing that seems a bit of annoy. There are no buttons for next track or previous track. I have to rely on the soft buttons, and sometimes the limited displayed char. makes me wonder what these buttons are for. Overall, this is a very good one for $36 . I like it."
3,Reasonable multi remote replacement,"Pros:Easily replaced all the remotes I've tried.Once setup it makes it easier for non techy types to use the jungle of A/V equipment I have.Inexpensive enough to forgive many of it's sins.Still improving. So hopefully some of my gripes will go away in time.Cons:The web interface to configure the remote is somewhat painful to use and definitely more painful for advanced configuration.Doesn't put the most sensible items first for a given device. ex the Tivo button isn't on the first screen for my Tivo.Isn't very forgiving if your device isn't receptive. ex My syntax olevia often misses commands which is totally Syntax's fault but still it'd be nice if I didn't have to resort to ""help"" everytime the TV doesn't turn on."
4,A great extra controller,"Great controller, I bought it to be able to control my Sony Dream system after my dog had destroyed the original controller. Took awhile to get it functioning - I would say about 40 minutes, and I would consider myself an expert computer user. Getting all the systems (TV, sound system or DVD mode) to work together took some tinkering with; the help button on the remote makes this quite easy. Many of the system specific buttons on this remote are on the variable buttons which are shown on the LCD, gets very annoying scrolling through the screens to find a specific function for a specific device but it does work. The buttons also are not as comfortable as my bulky Sony controller and it does add to the number of controllers being set on my coffee table. Overall it is a good controller and I think it was a great deal, especially in comparison to the $100 models that Logitech offers."
4,Great Remote - Works with Tivo and Akai TV,"I purchased an AKAI CFTD2011 which would not work with my Tivo (Humax DVD) remote. I tried several universal remotes, including ""learning"" remotes and could get none of them to work with the AKAI TV. I purchased the Harmony 628 at a great price from Amazon. Initially, it would not work with the AKAI, but after spending a few minutes with Harmony's tech support, they should be how to get the Harmony to learn the AKAI's commands. With some more exploration of their web site, I have been able to set up the Harmony so that it works very well with both the AKAI and Tivo. The Harmony is very flexible and powerful (5 stars), but it requires some tweaking and experimentation to get it set up the way you want (3 stars). I plan to get a second one for my other system."
4,Remote Awesome - Setup DIFFICULT!,"Read the logitech.com forums before buying this one. Installing the application and establishing communication with the remote took over an hour! The USB connection software is buggy and kept lockig up the remote. This happened on TWO remotes I configured for two different people. In the forum you'll see hundreds have this same problem. After overcoming that, the remote is FANTASTIC!!! The only downfall is it is a very Macro specific remote. Don't dare turn off the TV by hand, that will throw everything off. Still, the best universal remote I've ever owned."
3,Its just ok,"The software installation was ok...not the greatest but logitech tries to make it easier for the novice user. I had to have it update the firmware first before any real progress was made.I have to be honest its not the remote for me...I prefer using my old sony touchscreen. If you have someone who has 5 remotes and doesnt know how to use any of them except to push ""power"" then this remote makes sense. Using ""activities"" you can specify..""Watch DVD""..then it cycles through your devices for you; first turn on the tv, switch to input 2, then turn on dvd and or receiver. (Pretty simple for my mom to do.) For someone tech savvy, not too good but for everyone else worth considering but spend a little more for the better models."
2,Works Great for a short time,"This is a wonderful remote. I was finally able to consolidate all of my electronics to one remote and it worked like a charm... but then it freezes up! and there is nothing you can do other than toss it out! once out of warranty you can not get any support at all! And from what I have found in my research the ""freeze of death"" is not uncommon and there is no way to fix it.I have 2 of these and both have only lasted about 2 years. Not worth all of the dough I paid."
2,Great Features-Buy Stock in Battery Co.,"The features of this remote are great - it controls all components - even the new no-name TV we just bought. One touch turns on everything needed to watch TV, watch a movie, etc. The batteries, however, only last 5 or 6 days. Even expensive Lithium Ion batteries are dead after a week. The more expensive models come with a charger base - buy that model or buy stock in a battery company."
5,Awesome,"Short and simple, throw away all of your other remotes, just have the model numbers of your components when you hook up with usb to computer and this remote does the rest, AWESOME."
2,Doesn't live up to expections,"Too few buttons. If you need to replace remotes with lots of buttons, this remote is utterly useless. It will lump all the functions without dedicated buttons to the LCD screen and you'll have to scroll through them. The LCD menu will only display a few characters, so you'll have to guess what the LCD key stands for. Only 3 activity buttons, if you have more devices, this means you'll have to scroll through the device buttons. This remote is going to the drawer for me. Not easy to program, this is from a software engineer. My old Sony RM-VL900 is much,much, better. If you have remotes with lots of buttons and if you have more than 3 devices you want to control, this remote is not for you. It's way over rated."
2,extremely poor web site,The logitech site always keeps giving the message that they are experiencing high volume traffic and asks to try later. I have been trying for the last two days. It is going back to the staore. there is no point in spending big bucks and spending days for their internet traffic to clear up
2,Avg. remote,This is one of those items you think... Cool I can program the remote maybe make macro's to do what I want it to do. By the time you are finished loading the CD and registering the device you have to download a firmware update and software update then re-register. The model selection for your devices is avg. The default key layouts are minimal and not necessarily how you would expect them to work. The customized menu items are 1 function without being able to customize with multiple functions for 1 menu item. This is an avg remote you would do better to purchase a simple 9$ universal remote.The web interface is very clunky and lazy.
3,"OK, but no miracle worker","I have had various universal remotes, and this is decent but wont solve all your problems. Plus the light broke after about a year, though they did replace it. Main problem is that the remote still doesnt know what the TV/Reciever/Sattelite is actually set to. So when inevitibly there is some timing issue or a command is missed, its all out of whack. And with IR its going to happen unless you point it at each device every time. Wish it was all RF. Also i still had to program keys on my remote. Critical keys for satellite DVR were not represented, especially the commercial skip"
2,Frustrating programming,"Be very careful with the initial programming of this device. If you need to change something later, you're SOL! It's now just sitting in a drawer..."
4,How great is this?,"This remote is great, it controls everything I need it to with ZERO probelms, and if you did have a problem it can help you fix it! This remote is a little on the pricy side but well worth it when you can control yourTVVCRDVD PlayerTIVOCable -or- Dish SystemStero SystemSurround SoundX-BOXBOSEAND MORE....I love this remote I took all the other ones, and placed the in the drawer. The software for this is really simple to use, and follow it really walks you through the setup process really well. The best part is you can program it to do certain things for example: If you want to watch a DVD, it will turn on the TV, DVD Player, and Audio System all at the same time - how cool is that! This is worth the money - the dog even got ahold of the remote and did a number on it, and it still works! The screen could be a little bit larger though, not by much!"
5,..... It doesn't get much better than this,"After hearing the original version of ""Only You"", I knew that 112 would have a classic CD. I remember buying this CD on the first day that it came out. I didn't know what to expect because the only songs that I had heard were the original and remix versions of ""Only You"". When I heard the first part of the CD, I was almost shocked because they had some tight ballads that I wasn't expecting to hear. There is an excellent mix of ballads, midtempo songs and uptempo songs. The best examples of this are ""Come See Me"" w/Mr. Cheeks from The Lost Boyz, ""Pleasure And Pain"", ""Cupid"", ""I Can't Believe"" w/Faith Evans, and ""Now That We're Done"". This CD as well as Faith Evans' ""Faith"" are the best Bad Boy R&B releases. This will always be a classic CD."
5,112 is da bomb!!,This cd is da bomb! So is 112! There alwayz be #1 in my book ALWAYZ N 4 EVA!!!! I AM THERE #1 FAN!
5,Off the chain!,"Ok, so I was going through some old cd's I had, moving music to IPOD making a ""Slow Jams"" playlist and came across the ""old"" 112 from like 1996. (SMH) This joint is Off the Freakin' Meter do you hear me? Songs like Cupid & Come see me....these songs are hott. This cd will continue to get airplay and will be getting played on a constant basis in the ride.If you are an old school 112 fan, this cd is a must for your collection! Your mileage won't vary on this one. My suggestion, buy it! NEOSOUL06"
2,Too slow,"If 112 are looking for harmony,rhythm and style they should crawl over to Dru hill for proper lessons. Hey! 112 look on the bright side though the lesson is gonna be for free. DRU HILL IS THE BOMB Y'ALL. RECOGNIZE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,112 cd,"I can not review this product, because I never received the product. At the time when the product was supposed to be delivered, I was having surgery. The mail man could have put the product in someone else's mail box by mistake. I do not how to track that down. Thanks for the purchase, that I did not received. I hope it made someone else happy."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"This book is horrible. I am not writing this review as a disenchanted uniformitarianism, but actually as a Christian scientist. It is the attitude of such men as Mr. Whitcomb that the myth of the ignorant Christian is perpetuated. In his book, he attempts to disprove science by simply dismissing it, rather than actually addressing the issue. It is by skirting the issue that he hopes to make his impact. Also, he uses italics and exclamation points heavily, which is a sign of emotional, rather than sound, scientific logic. Whitcomb must learn that in order to disprove science, you have to use science. I would not ever recommend this book, unless you are morbidly curious to read such an atrocity."
1,Less than expected,"I am an appraiser in the NW and I am looking for more information identifying residential styles. This little book would be more helpful for commercial appraisers, East of the Mississippi. (Buildings aren't that old here...)"
1,not the the,"be forewarned. this is not THE Matt Johnson of THE THE., but a rather less than mediocre matt johnson."
4,great stuff,I stand all day on my feet and at the end of the day they are swollen and throb. Apply before going to sleep and it is so refreshing and cooling. It makes a big difference in the way they feel. I would recommend this product.
1,Interesting,"I got this book as a gag gift for my older brother. I went through the book and bookmarked and underlined the phrases I thought would be good for him. The book is pretty intense, and to be honest I can't believe there's a handbook of such a thing. The writing style is also quite advanced, and the author likes to use uncommon synonyms for common words."
5,Great book!,"This is a great book. Its a dense read, every word is important, so don't think you can just read it in a single afternoon"
5,Rare Find for a Self Help Book,"In my life, I must have read hundreds of self help books. This is one of the very best.It is succinct, well written, and to the point. It has questions at the end of most chapters.It also has lists of things to keep in mind while reflecting on one's self and one'srelationships."
5,My handbook for life.,"This is an amazing book that I have kept with me and continued to read for at least 10 years now. It is definitly the most comprehensive overview of Jungian Psychology for the average person who is interested in developing a greater understanding of their Self. It is easy to read, short, and covers all the basics. If you are interested in a deeper comprehension of your life, your relationships, and Jungian Psychology - this is the one book you should turn to for guidance."
3,A fairly good guide to IIS 6,I look to a lot of different resources when I study something. This one was fairly good but not the best. I think it is a good start but I have found better books on IIS 6.
2,Not The Best or Cheapest Option...,"This product will get the job done, but, really no need to spend more $s for this dedicated/single-purpose cable. Just buy the Monster iStudioLink instead. Cheaper. You can plug it into your computer 1/8"" sound input and then plug your current instrument cable into the adapter. Especially good option if you already have some high quality instrument cables."
3,"Not bad, gets the job done if you're just starting out","This cable did the trick for me, simply letting me plug and record my guitar onto my computer through Garageband. The audio that comes out of it isn't of the highest quality but for a beginner like me, it gets the job done."
2,"Good idea, but that's about it.",Just didn't go where it should have. The characters were not developed well at all. Nor are they interesting.
2,Lacks logic for where it goes.,"This book has a great premise and some interesting ideas. Too bad it has almost no characterization and some decisions make no sense.The biggest problem is that the main characters are in no way qualified to continue to deal with the big discovery at the heart of the story. A pilot, a lawyer, and an lab tech are in charge of the discovery of advanced technology? The author tries to justify it in various ways, but I think even he realized he was stretching it.And I agree that the ending was very weak.Skip this one and look at one of McDevitt's better novels."
2,Not Worth The Wait,"After reading, and loving, McDevitt's Engines of God, I eagerly awaited the release of Ancient Shores. While the premise was promising the execution wasn't. It relied too heavily on broad character characteratures and trite plot conventions- and the themes it explored (i.e., what happens to humans when we recieve proof of little green men) was treated better by Sagan's Contact-both the book and movie version."
5,Engaging archeological SF!,"Jack McDevitt has the tongue of a storyteller and the pen of a poet. If you love the mysteries of archeology combined with the visions of SF, as do I, do not be without him.--Allan Combs; author of The Radiance of Being, and Synchronicity"
1,overrated at one star...,"This book takes an interesting idea and then somehow takes and pours concrete all over it! This was an incredibily slow read and one that does little to to look into the possibilities/problems the chance of new worlds would bring to society. There is little written here about exploring the world(s)opened up by the discovery of ""gateways"" to these worlds. The idea is pretty good of these gateways to other worlds craeted by an alien race but the book spends too much time on mental moral arguments. It limps along trying to tie everything in with some angst about the sins of the whites in their contacts with previous cultures on our world. Yeah, here is an opportunity for humanity to spread out again and these two shallow, boring characters spend most of the book in debate...Overall, a waste of money, too PC and just boring. As already stated a great idea done wrong! Try SM Stirlings ""Conquistadors"" for this type of book that works!"
4,Better than the cover led me to expect!,"This novel reminded me of the science fiction I used to read in high school, back when I was a fan of the genre. The mystery item found in the North Dakota field drew me in and the story continued at a page-turning pace to the very end. I enjoyed how the discovery of the two alien artifacts impacted different people around the world. The ending was a little predictable but it was wonderful none the less. The characters were rather thinly sketched, which is why I gave it four stars."
3,"Fun, but light","Not as good as Eternity Road or Engines of God, but still enjoyable. The cover art is bad, the gratuitous use of famous people at the end is sappy and, as with all of his books, there's no huge resolution at the end, but it moves quickly and makes good airplane or beach reading."
3,Not up to his last...,"Having discovered McDevitt's Engines of God, I was very eager for his next one. Ancient Shores has it's moments, but by and large was not very satisfying. The main thrust of the story, the discovery of some VERY old artifacts in a farm lead us into the outer reaches of space, however the story stays rooted on Earth. making the story more of a statement of how soceity would react to these discoveries. While all this is interesting, I wanted the stars. Keep'em coming Jack."
2,More human interest than reals SF,"Too much, yet not enough. That is the way I would describe my feelings about this book. On the one hand, McDevitt once again has an interesting idea. The problem is he doesn't do enough with it, but tries to change the book into a human interest story. As a result the focus is too much on the persons in the book, whether relevant or not. This results the characters to be too extreme, and in a number of cases, irrelevant. The flip side of the coin is that he doesn't do enough with the science fiction ideas: not on the human side nor on the technical, political or socio-economical side."
3,"Good premise, but the details disappoint","I wanted to like this book. Like other reviewers pointed out, the first few chapters were compelling enough to keep me reading. Then the story started spinning out of control.Neither the characters nor the governments depicted by the author behaved in a believable manner. The book offered many possible threads towards the end, only to leave them dangling. The characters seemed to be going along for the ride throughout the book, not really shaping events, but rather always at the mercy of them. They offered little more than a long string of disappointments to this reader.One would hope that mankind would respond with a little more maturity if such events ever took place."
3,Interesting Snapshot of Potential Human Behavior,"McDevitt tells another good story, just like I expected, he builds conflict and suspense just like I expected. And, as expected, he creates lots of questions and answers most of them (McDevitt has a habit of creating more questions than he answers, in my opinion). The only reason I didn't give this work a fourth star is McDevitt's use of current day celebrities, while true to his intent to tell a story as close to our times as possible, seems a little ""cheesy"" and stilted in its execution.Overall, I like McDevitt's ideas and storytelling ability; he creates another fun story and keeps it interesting and satisfying to read, dispite a few stumbles."
2,Boring and Implausible -- not one of his better works,"I came very close to dropping this book midway through. It is quite some way into the book before anything remotely interesting happens, and even when the plot begins to move it is fairly prosaic, along with being completely implausible (and I don't mean the sci-fi elements are implausible -- I mean the more mundane aspects of the plot such as the unrealistic course of governmental intervention, superficial invovlement of business entities, complete lack of normal precautions taken by the characters at some points, etc).McDevitt's books are not, in my experience, generally this poor. I rather liked Chindi. Perhaps he has gotten better as time goes on -- ""Ancient Shores"" is fairly old now."
3,"You've got to be kidding, right?",The first part of the book held out so much promise. The middle part of the book seemed interesting enough but that ending is one of the worst I've ever seen. What the hell was he thinking?I just got done reading this and I feel cheated.
2,"Not Bad, Not Great","An interesting premise never fully realized. The initial story of possible first contact through an unearthed link to other worlds is intriguing but never really developed. Many minor characters come and go to illustrate the effect of first contact on society, but very few of these characters are interesting and eventually it becomes deadening. The story manages to create an occasional sense of wonder, and there is some suspense at the end, but the payoff just isn't there. The story never resolves itself and is unbelieveable at best, leaving unanswered questions and a sense of unfulfillment. Nicely written but don't expect to discover much about the book's central mystery, which is who built the advanced technology about which the primary story circles and circles and circles without landing."
5,Fun and intriguing read,"Anyone remotely interested in the brain, neuroscience, or just science in general may enjoy this book. It is written in an informal, conversational style. At times the author gets slightly carried away with her own wit, but her personality does keep the book lively. The contents of the book could be described as a broad survey of the various aspects of (at the time) the current understanding of the brain -- intertwined around a series of relevant interviews with some of the notable researchers in the field."
3,"Great start, gets bogged down for the long haul.","This book really seemed promising, with a great title and a very fine first 50 pages or so. But then it sort of gets lost, meandering through a survey of all sorts of disconnected research material. It seems to be saying the same things over and over, pozing interesting questions along the way, but always just leaving them on the table and moving on. I had to fight to read the last 50 pages (I hate not finishing books). Good cover and publishing job."
1,"Good name, bad product","The chrome was pitted and ugly, the gimbals were quickly designed, the glass was thinner than the metal and I returned the product immediately. The Taiwanese built lamp is miles from what you would feel comfortable spending more than $35 or $45 for. The company must of bought some great names and designs, and then redesigned them all for their manufacturing abilities. I then tried a yacht lamp from an Indian manufacturer selling via Vermont and those were dangerous! I have since paused on my search for a safe and well built oil lamp. This was a review of Weems and Plath, not the retailer of Amazon who was gracious enough to accept my return."
4,Groovy,This is a must buy if you are into good electro music. A very groovy sound.... not the old sound Misstress Barbara used to do. Not Techno!
3,Do you have large pockets?,"This book is perfect to use as a final judge for Scrabble players, however, the ""Pocket"" is very misleading. We wanted to take the book on a trip overseas where weight is a huge factor for packing. The book did not come with us as it's too heavy to be worth it. It's NOT a pocket book!"
4,Haunting sounds of Zeppelin,I heard this CD while shopping in a music department almost a year ago.I just recently ordered this from Amazon to own it.It has haunted me and stayed in my mind.I now own a car with a CD player and this is a must own for car trips.
1,Can I have my money back???,"I bought this CD based on the previous writers GLOWING REVIEW and the short audio clips provided. I couldn't be more disappointed. BOTTOM LINE?...The London Symphony is a powerful tool in the right hands. But in the hands of Jaz Coleman it has been beaten into a mid-eastern scimitar and used to hack and butcher some of Zeppelins best tunes...""HASSAN CHOP!"". I've enjoyed other ""Symphonic Rock"" treatments, e.g. Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, etc. and Led Zep has great potential. Unfortunately I didn't find much enjoyment here. In fact the first and last ""tunes"" have NOTHING to do with either Zeppelin or Classical music and are nothing more than eleven minutes of random noise...please!"
3,very much a mixed bag...,"Okay, some of the tracks on this CD are great. The Battle of Evermore is amazing; Kashmir and (surprisingly) When the Levee Breaks are also quite good. The ambient opening and closing tracks are decent too.However...the others are not so good. Stairway is especially a disappointment: you would think it would be particularly well-suited to this sort of treatment, but unfortunately, the orchestra is a little too reverent--it sounds almost exactly like the original, but without the words. Woo hoo! Led Zeppelin karaoke! Too exciting! As for Friends and All My Love--well, I was never a big fan of these songs anyway, and the symphonic thing doesn't really help them.Even with its inconsistencies, it's still worth buying. Evermore really is incredible."
1,"Horrible, Hideous",Led Zeppelin could be the best band ever. HOwever without one electric instrument or guitar they are horrible. You can't have an orchestrea play this. And no lyrics. No lyrics makes this CD expecially horrible.
4,Fellowes Standard Glare filter and anti-static-Anti Radiation.,"Well, this device looks to me that is almost what I was looking for. However it came with some lightly deffects."
2,other than the theme there is nothing worth buying.,the music by Elfman isn't the kind you listen to over and over. I was hoping for more of the theme than just track 2.
5,This is one Danny Elfmans best.,"I cant stop listening to this score. Danny Elfman is a master, the Mission:Impossible theme is great. I've heard people complaining about the absence of the M:I theme. But this is way better than the trash Hans Zimmer used for the theme in M:I2. This is the way Lalo Schifrin intended. Beautiful film score, good percussion, jazz flavour, theatrical elements, and Danny Elfman flavour. I give this album the A+! Buy it you wont be dissapointed, buy the MI:2 score and you will. The two soundtracks are uncomparable. This one is far more superior."
3,"Flawed, but good.","Danny Elfman does a great job with the music for the 1996 blockbuster film. Music is an important part of the movie (pay attention to the way the music compliments the heist sequence), but this CD has a major flaw- where in the heck is the Mission: Impossible theme that was played at the end of the movie!Other than that, a good CD."
2,"So, so product","The first time I used it to make a fruit shake, although there were still a few pieces of ice cubes in the shake, I was happy with it. However, after only a few uses, the blade was rusted. I was so disappointed and I email their customer service. They actually responded to my request pretty quickly and sent me a replacement and it seems to be fine now.Overall, it is only a so, so product. I can never get all the ice chopped, always have a few big pieces left. If you are only chopping a small portion, it doesn't chop well. But if you are only using it for making milk shake or similiar stuffs, it is really good."
2,Disapointing,"The chopper has worked fine for me so far. I have only had it 3 months though. The bowl is small, so I have to do many batches when grating cheese. The biggest dissapointment is the blender attachment. The rubber ""ring"" underneath the blender melted itself onto the base, therefore attaching my blender to the base. This happened during my second use of the blender attachment. I finally detached the blender from the base destroying the rubber ring. Now my blender attachment is useless. The smoothie was good though!I was a fool and bought this from the ultimate chopper website and paid over $125. I learned my lesson."
2,So Many Complaints!!,"First I do have to say that I have not purchased the Chopper yet. I was going through all the reviews and it did scare me off a bit. I contacted the website AS SEEN ON TV and voiced everyones opinion to their sales department, hoping they will have an excuse for the many problems with these blades. I hope that this product is indeed how they advertised it because it sounds like a great product. Regardless, I hope to recieve information about the true matter on the blades as well as how long one should wait to recieve the product. I encourage everyone not to go on blind faith and to hold these companies and maufacturers responsible. We are the customers and they should be answering to us."
1,Have not recieved,"As seen on tv has still not sent me my Chopper/Blender. I have lost hope on ever receiving it as I order it 3 months ago! If you can get it from anyone else, please do. I don't deny that the product seems nice, which is why I ordered it."
1,Poor Customer Service,"Customer Service charged my Credit Card on April 26th for a replacement blade that broke when chopping onions (not brick as advertised) First call on May 15th I was told if I did not receive it by Friday to call back. Called back on Friday and talked with Denise and she told me she didn't understand why I hadn't received it, but she had one in her office and would send it immediately. Called back in on May 30th and was told it was sent by Corporate not their office and no tracking number was available. They gave me the corporate number and they stated they have no reocrd of anything being shipped and it would be shipped tomorrow and they (Ryan) would call me back tomorrow with a tracking number. Hopefully Ryan will be the first at Ultimate chopper with integrity."
1,Not recommended,"While the ultimate chopper does chop/blend/etc, it works poorly with anything liquid (such as baby food, fruit, and so on). The bowl is quite small and it can be messy to remove the contents after chopping or blending. Also, if the bowl is only partly full it doesn't chop/blend well. The blender attachment does a poor job with shakes and smoothies. I do not recommend this product."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! Ultimate Dishonest Company!!,"I ordered my Chopper by phone in November of 2005. I was told my credit card would be charged $59.00. When it finally arrived (three months later) a processing fee was magically added to my bill for a total of $79.00! This cannot be legal. I called customer service. They agreed with me -they saw from my invoice that I was over charged! They said I would be refunded the $20 in 2 weeks. Since then I've called 3 more times and was lied to again and again. No money returned as promised. (Also -the free steak knives NEVER came - more lies!) Now, the cheap plastic Chopper is broken. The top won't seperate from the motor. Their answer? More run-around! I will not give up. If I could, I would have given zero stars! If anyone wants to start a class action suit I would be willing!"
2,Ultimate chopper/blender combo,"This is the second time I've purchased this product, however after using if for about two months I realized the quality was not as good as the previous purchase. I wound up buying a Cusinart food processor and Cusinart Blender as they are much, much more sturdy and efficient to use. I cannot recommend this product."
5,Great Family Movie!!!!!!!!!,This is a great family movie about the trials and tribulations of life on the farm.It's a must see that should be on DVD!!!!!!!!!
2,Don't buy unless you're an English major and desperate for something to read.,"Very well researched but dreary academic writing. Although I teach college level English, I did not finish this book because it seemed ""much ado about nothing."""
3,rubber too soft,"This door seal is too soft. It was advertised as hard rubber, but is instead a very soft and light rubber."
1,not Frost King as stated,"This stated that it is Frost King and it is not. Frost King is hard rubber, what they send you is cut of a large spool and is soft rubber.I ask for a refund from Amazon and got it since it was not as stated."
1,soft foam NOT rubber,"Too soft and flimsy, not like the hard rubber that I thought it was. Wish I would have read the reviews completely before I purchased. Probably will need to replace this chaep foam rubber seal next season."
1,"Not rubber, but foam","The picture showes the same shape as I am familiar with and description says RUBBER, but it is actually very light FOAM. Formally it is true because it is really rubber foam, but in my case it is unusable. In the future I am going to keep away from Frostking products."
4,Good investment and starter for kinder dancers,"I bought this thinking I was getting the right thing last christmas; I was apparently very wrong, but I bet if I'd gotten what she really meant (baby princess ballet studio) it would have sat unused alot more over the past year. My daughter's in pre-school dance and now kinderdance and kinder-ballet - she LOVES this dance studio at home. She sets up the bar and mat, changes into her full dance gear and plugs in the dvd (or vhs) and gets moving! She loves the songs, the sing-song thru the 5 positions and it significantly helped at dance class to know the proper names of positions and how to place your foot (from the mat). EXCELLENT value! Would be great if this had supplemental videos to go thru the next couple stages or moves that build on the 5 positions."
2,Strange Video,"My four year old who takes ballet was so excited to do this video. but after a 5 minute intro she asked ""when is this commercial going to stop?"" The video was too fast paced and with giant teddy bears and a talking monkey puppet was too strange. After 10 minutes my daughter became extremely frustrated and gave up. I'll be buying a different ballet video. On a positive note ... she liked the bar and the mat."
5,Sara's review,"After getting this toy I am very excited about starting ballet class. I am always wanting to put on my tutu and slippers and practice with the tape . I never get tired of it. I can,t wait to try out other tapes by bella . I love my bella dancerella."
2,Bella Dancerella is a Dissapointment,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter because the commercials made it to be better than it actually is. For $30.00(plus this item did not have free shipping) you get a plastic mat that has two sides, a plastic barre, and an instructional video, and ballet slippers that barely fit. The video uses song and a kind of techno sounding beat to try to teach the steps. My daugter was a bit confused when she used this. It was like a game of twister for her. She wasn't sure where to put her feet and at times and needed encouragement from me to help her place her feet. It says you can combine the foot moves to make a dance. If my daughter cannot figure out where to put her feet how is she going to do that? The money would have been better spent on real ballet lessons with a real instructor. She learns more from an episode of Teletubbies."
2,"Soooo, not a fan","I need to say that my 4 year old likes it, I however think is a waste. My daughter is in dance class and this is nothing like what she does. It goes way too fast for her to keep up and the girl and the characters are so cheesy. I feel like it was a disappointment. If you want you children to be involved in dancing, which I was at a young age, and now my daughter is, this is not the way to go."
1,The Worst Toy Ever,"The movie makes me seem stupid, and then when I started real balley classes I couldn't do anything:( ..."
1,disappointment,"This was my four year olds birthday present of choice. What a disappointment, the video was full of gimmicks (a song about healthy eating)and was geared toward babies for most of the video. It is nothing we expected.Most of the video is a girl dressed like an 80s pop star not a ballerina, the ballet segments are few and only cover the the 7 ballet positions with the instructor nodding her head annoyingly through the whole thing...trust me when u see your kid copying her you will be very annoyed. My child spent half of the 30 minutes sitting on the couch looking sad that there wasnt more ""ballerina stuff"" on the video."
1,Not for chlildren taking dance class,"This toy may be ok if your child does not take dance. If your child has ever taken dance AT ALL they will be bored. My daughter did not like it. The quality of the video is a joke, and turning the mat over and getting it straightend out in about 15 seconds is almost impossible for a young child. I think this toy is a total waste of money."
2,dancerella dvd,Bella looks like a hoochie in most of the show. Too much techno style. She does't give you any time to flip over the mat from left to right. Bella should be in mirror image to the child dancing. This was a good idea but they didn't spend enough time with details. 5 stars for their idea. 2 stars for the outcome.
3,This is a mediocre CD,"While Tim ""herb"" Alexander (formerly of Primus) is the drummer on this album and I love his playing in Primus, I was disappointed that he opted to not use the double bass here. Musically, the CD was pretty good. It was like a cross between Helmet and Alice in Chains, but I didn't really care for the singing, which was also by Tim Alexander. All of the songs and singing began to sound alike by the end of the album. However, overall the Cd had its high points, along with some great drumming and guitar riffs."
5,A Wonderful Book,"I agree with the previous review and I wanted to add that this is a beautiful book, the art work is bold and colorful and the message is loving. I bought this book last year and was saving it to give to someone this Christmas. As I was starting to wrap it, I read the book to my children and I remembered how much I liked it. I am ordering a couple more for other friends!"
5,What a gem!,"What a moving and unexpected story! I first read about this lovely novel in an article about digitally downloadable books. And I'm so glad that I thought to save the article and look it up. As it turns out, Random House had the foresight to give it the publication it truly deserves. It's been a long time since I felt so transported by a new find. Cameron Dougan really has an ear for the interior life. I really couldn't put it down. And I can't wait to hear if there's another book to come."
1,Because She Is Dumb,"I suppose it's my working-class background but when I finished this book I threw it across the room. It just did not resonate with me at all. The writing is fine and Dougan is at his best when zeroing in on Kim's family dynamic - but the whole thing is ultimately an empty exercise. I found it hard to care about an essentially shallow, incredibly beautiful woman with father issues who spends her entire adult life as the mistress of a very wealthy man. PUH-LEEZE! Even AFTER she realizes she needs to be independent in order to have any kind of meaningful existence she flies to Paris ON THE RICH GUY'S DIME! Then the damn novel UTTERLY self destructs as she pines away after some utterly cliched ""artist"" character. I actually ended up wishing I could somehow reclaim the time I spent reading this fodderol."
5,a must have for the fan,"Another quality DVD from RHINO. Just like 1-3, this is a nice transfer with wonderful sound. The disk includes Battle of the planets episodes, Gatchaman episodes(what started it all) and G-Force episodes (an abomination). I grew up on the planets episodes and they are still wonderful, looking just as I left them. The Gatchaman episodes are great,wonderful action but sometimes brutal. They show how much was left on the cutting room floor in order to turn this into kids tv. The G-force episodes are of good quality but the content....UGH! Most of the same scenes you will remember but with some of the worst voice overs I have EVER heard. I purchased this along with the other 3 and will buy the rest. Bring THEM ON RHINO>>WHOO"
4,Better in Discussing Engineering than Ackermann,"This should be compared to Thomas Ackermann's ""Wind Power in Power Systems.""If I purchased only one, it would be Ackermann, which I think is generally more comprehensive (and bigger). That said, I would need to supplement it with a lot of specific engineering data if I wanted to do any particular analysis.Heier gets much more into lower level engineering details. Ackermann, looks more at a general systems and regulatory environment perspective.Both books are very good and generally easy to read, providing good overviews of ""current"" practise."
1,I was disappointed,"Some of his stories are mildly amusing, but I was distressed about most of them He boasts of committing arson, vandalism, entrapment, favoritism, and selective prosecution in the name of law enforcement. He may not have technically committed violations of law, but they were borderline unethical and unprofessional. He also chronically whines about too little funding, but every employee of every government agency at the local, state, and federal level make the same gripe.Being familiar with some of the locations in his stories, I recognize embellishment in his tales. Literary license."
1,too reflective,"I got this because my monitor faces a window and during the daylight hours I can barely read the screen. This filter did little to help because its surface is flat, shiny, and reflective - as bad as the glass on my monitor. I am returning it for a filter with a non-reflective coating."
3,Surprised,"I thought that The History Channel would have done a great job in reviewing Dr. King's life, but I was quite disappointed. It is my belief, after watching the ""Citizen King"" and ""Freedom Riders"" DVDs that this one has quite a few inaccuracies and doesn't do justice to telling a well-rounded story about Dr. King. The man was not a saint - he one man doing extraordinary things. There is no reason to excuse his human flaws any more than there is a reason not to acknowledge his accomplishments. If I choose only one DVD to watch about King it would, hands down, be ""Citizen King."" It is a much better, more balanced, historically accurate review of Dr. King's life and contributions."
5,Awesome documentary shipped to me in excellent condition,I bought this item used and it was in excellent condition. There were no wears or tears on it and the film itself was just excellent. Bravo to this seller and Bravo to the History Channel.
5,Ethereal heights,"Richard Strauss wrote the Four Last Songs in 1948, when he was in his 80s, and a year away from his own death. His country had been devastated by the Second World War, and it was from the lofty plateau of a wiser old age that he looks back with these wonderful reflections on mortality and the rich beauty of life. I think the Four Last Songs the best thing Strauss wrote.Many will debate their favourite recordings. There are different strengths to different performances. For me, Jessye Norman has the controlled power to make this the standout performance so far recorded. Kurt Masur's conducting is superb, and the Gewandhaus produces all the calm variation of this rich score.The set is rounded out by other great orchestral songs by Strauss."
3,Odd,"While I agree that Norman's voice is just drop dead gorgeous, why did they have to take everything so SSSSLLLLLLOOOOOWWWWLLLYYY? At times, the effect is comical. Just sing the song! Let the song speak! I couldn't sense of the construction of the Four Last Songs because of the quirky choice of tempo... I like the sound of her voice, but I enjoy Strauss as a composer too much to recommend this."
2,I agree with music fan from Albuquerque,"OK, Mme. Norman has a huge cathedral of a voice, and this recording has its visceral thrills. That she ignores Strauss's ""nicht schleppend"" marks troubles me, because the composer clearly wants the music to move, and the performer seems to be more interested in luxuriating in her voice. Sorry, but this is a recording strictly for those who don't much care whether Strauss is well-served. Recommended: Gundula Janowitz/von Karajan and Lucia Popp/Tennstedt. Also Sena Jurinac, but it's hard to find."
2,Nothing spectacular,"Not the worst thing I ever read, but I can't say I was too impressed either. If you overlook the grammatical and spelling errors, you'll find a science fiction story that seems to want to be taken very seriously, but at the same time is based on such a ludicrous premise that it's just impossible to do so. The primary character of Trenton Stowel is the centerpiece of the story, and I wanted to like him but I just didn't find him all that engaging (at one point in the story his mysterious interviewer tells Stowel, and by proxy the reader, that Stowel is 'definitely very interesting'; I'm glad at least the other characters thought so, but stating it outright don't make it so). Again, not the worst thing I've ever read, but amateurish in both content and presentation, and certainly not worth it's relatively large price tag."
5,Great Imagination and a neat idea about time travel.,"The book was very enjoying to read. It was hard to put the book down once it was started. There were a couple of typos, but what book today doesn't have those? The story takes you through time and travel in the mind of Trenton Stowel. I would recommend it, it was a lot of fun!"
1,Rambling,"I felt the dialog for the character in this book was rambling and repetitive. So much so, that I could not make it halfway through the book. I strongly recommend you move on and purchase one of the many other fine books available in the sci-fi universe."
2,A bit of a Dud,"I started reading this book and just stopped after the first chapter. Possibly it is a bit over my head, but I did not find it interesting and it was just too much of a hassle to keep up with this fractured time story."
2,Better then the first but not by much,"I don't know how the other people gave this book so many stars. I don't know what they're comparing this to but I feel sorry for their book choices. I didn't think much about the first book (although, I did read it from cover to cover) so I shouldn't slam it too much. If you've read the first one, well, this one is a bit better. Lot's of action. Lot's of huh? And lot's of ""yeah sure"". I haven't read any of her other series and to be honest after this I don't know if I want to. But you never know:)"
5,"""Performance Today"" recommendation",A basic classical music collection recording. One of ten recording considered by the this NPR radio programs folks to give a well rounded introduction to classical music appreciation.
5,Bach:Brandenburg Concertos Nos.4 - 6,"I knew I wanted this album from listening to it online. It came brand new, faster than promised and in exactally the condition as promised. I'm completly satisfied!"
3,Good magic but low quality DVD,"This had some good performances on it but the quality of the DVD wasn't very good. One thing that bothers me is that there were so many acts involving cigarettes. While these people were mostly very good, this is just not the kind of magic that I want to be watching. There were other performances that were more enjoyable."
2,Don't be Disillusioned,"This dvd is a compilation of 3-5 minutes edits of Magic's greats acts from TV and Stevens magic videos (SHIMADA & MARVYN ROY & CAROL) ... 0ther performers Blackstone Jr., Chuck Jones, Copperfield, James Dimmare, S&R, Philip (not one of the greats) Ron Lucas-Vent. Frank Garcia-stage act. finally Vito lupo's FISM act from the 80's. Video production 2rate at best since it is 3 generation. If you are a magician of 25 yrs experience you have seen everthing on this from old tv specials you may all ready have."
3,"""Tradition, tradition""...as the Broadway song goes...","The first nine tracks here feature famous and mostly Catholic hymns performed by one of the greatest voices of the 20th century. The presentation is ""high church mid-century"" style, with appropriate supporting instruments and choir. If you like these classic songs, you will enjoy this disc. However, I was greatly disappointed in track ten, a seven-minute recital of the famous prayer of St. Francis of Assisi. On that one, the pomp and ceremony and stately reverence is laid on to a fault. In that piece of writing, one of my favorites, I always sense humility. This oratorio-style arrangement makes it seem almost arrogant instead. This may please some tastes, but I won't play that track again. The first nine, however, are kind of a nice reminder of the church-goer I used to be."
5,"Should be entitled ""Venusian Fireworks""!","I just love this album. Explosive playing and orchestration, and a full range of memorable/singable melodies, diverse styles, and passionate emotions. This album has made pop-listeners into instrumental rock lovers. And with Adrian playing, who needs a singer?"
4,Fantastic job...in reality 4.8 stars...,"If you like instrumental guitar at all, buy this album. The range of sounds and emotions is unparalleled. Very rich in style, the background orchestration is a little overwhelming in one song but doesn't detract.Very well done. I am looking forward to new releases from Adrian.If you are ever in the DC area catch him at a live show. He has a web site.steve drabant"
1,Totally Uninspirational and Depressing...Oh No!,"I'm deeply dissapointed that Aussie Superstar Delta Goodrem releases this pathetic totally stale dry melancholical depressing Ballad with Ex Westlife Singer Brian McFadden ""Almost Here"", which I find the worst Song on the Mistaken Identity Album, total uninspirational and stale. It may be of interest for Brian McFadden Fans, but for Delta Goodrem Fans and other Music Fans hating such 08/15 melacholical ballads one finds enough in the media, I sadly say No Recomendation, the 1 Star Rating obviously underlining this! - Very dissapointing!"
5,Just beautiful,I love my new Sake set. It arrived today in perfect condition in a very nice gift box. The colors are vibrant and it looks so nice in my China cabinet. I definitely recommend this product.
1,Not very good...,"I could only read an hour of this. I always hate doing this to my own brethren. Poorly written, wordy, and dry."
1,1 STAR FOR ONE great track,"Ed here to tell you simply that this T.D album in my opinion has only one great track. This is my first negative review on any album.Though I tried to appreciate the whole album,I just could'nt.The only track I like is #1:Comet's Figure Head.The rest are just boring to me.I need music that moves me,not music that sounds dull overall.Even though I'm a new T.D fan[partly because they started before my time],I have listened to a few other albums from the nighties,and I know they can do a whole lot better than this. If they release another new album, hopefully next time, it'll be better."
2,too modern for me...,"I like the ""old"" Tangerine Dream (TD)! That is: The nice synthy sound - it does have rhythm, but no drums... TD used to be like that. Now, it seems, drums become more and more important. I myself play The Drums, but stil don't like it with TD. Sorry. If you buy this CD, be aware that you will get Drums with the synths."
4,All in all not bad...,"Tangerine Dream has done a masterful job of creating a specific mood that lends itself to the topic of space exploration. But as good as some of the tracks on this CD are (tracks 1, 9 and 10 are excellent), the overall collection can become a little monotonous at times.If you're a TG fan, this one may take some time to grow on you, but it's definitely worth a listen."
4,Perfect Recipes for Unexpected Company,"Just love Rozanne's books. I think I have all of them. Always favorable, always simple number of ingredients so you are more likely to have most of them on hand. I usually make her recipes and find hey are a good jumping off spot for ""doctoring up"" with additional ingredients, an extra spice here or there, switching one ingredient for another I have on hand."
1,it [wasnt' good],"... I thought that really [wasn't good] becuase my son is 12 years old and in 8th grade. For his science class he needs to build a mouse trap car. This information was not usefull. It did not tell him how to build carp! And it did not tell him how to build the mouse trap to success or whatever your logo is. Well anyways, I didn't think and my wife didnt think that that was any help to him. It was just a wast of my time!thank you for wasting my time... ...."
5,The BEST I have never seen before!,"No need to say anything, just buy it! It going with a 99 tracked CD. Also, many good examples and exercises to check your understanding. I am benefit by it so much."
3,A great introduction to vegan dining.,"This book is wonderful for the working family. Although a few of the recipes are uninteresting, the majority are simple and delicious. This book is a great reference for new and veteran vegans."
2,Just okay,"Not the worst book I've ever read, but there are many books about veganism which are far superior. I prefer Joanne Stepaniak's the Vegan Sourcebook, because it's far more comprehensive."
2,Not very good...,"I am a fan of Martin Popoff, and I was expecting great things from this book, but it is unable to deliver, unfortunately. The book names the most influential metal acts of the 70s, 80s, and 90s, summing up their careers in two or three pages. Sounds great, but the whole system just proves to be extremely boring, and the book is not designed to be a straight through read as I thought it would be (this was acceptable, obviously, with another Popoff book 'The Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal'). The book overall leaves me feeling unsatisfied, exactly the opposite reaction I thought it would give. I must also mention that the book leaves out Husker Du, who I feel several of the grunge bands (Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam) are heavily indebted to."
4,"Excellent, Perhaps Short Overview","I'm not a big fan of Popoff's writing style, but he does have a good ear for the metal scene. I found myself agreeing with a lot of what he wrote. Also, when he breaks down the bands by decade, it's pretty obvious that the metal world is in decline when Pantera is considered the most influential band of the 90's (although I dig their stuff)."
2,Not really 4 guage wire...,"I am very disappointed in this kit. The outside diameter (including insulation) of the power and ground are about correct for 4 gauge, but the wire inside is a #6 at best. More likely a #8!! This wire will not provide adequate current if you truly need 4 gauge wiring. BEWARE!!The RCA cable is nice though, that's the only reason for a two star and not a one star!"
1,Complete Waste of Money,"This ""2005"" documentary was a complete waste of money. Immediately from the first images of fluoro-coloured windsurfers and women with massive hair, it was clear this documentary was either made in the 1980's, or made in 2005 with stock video's filmed in the 80's. Information for travelling in unknown areas must be up-to-date to be of any use, and I find it highly disappointing that an amateur travel video such as this that is clearly 20 years old is marketing itself as a 2005 travel guide."
1,A Rip Off,"This DVD was a total rip off. The first clue that something was wrong was misspelled names of towns in America in the itinerary on the back. A hotel named in Las Vegas was demolished 20 years ago. The color is very poor and the content is superficial. It must have been filmed many, many years ago. The credits showing a German company added to the confusion about this product."
1,Great little film - poor quality transfer,"This is a great little film. It's let down considerably however from both poor picture and sound quality. Imagine a poor video recording from that video being watched repeatedly and you have some idea as to how poor this DVD quality is. Hence the rating. The film is a 3 or 4. The DVD quality is 1, simply because I cannot rate it 0."
1,Couldn't Stand It,"The sound track on this DVD was so horrendous I couldn't stand to watch it. What would be the point? I couldn't understand anything they were saying. I might have thrown out the disk and kept the case to use for a different disk, but the outer sleeve was all wrinkled and messed up. The whole thing went directly into the garbage can after about 20 minutes of trying to watch it. Other than that it was great.This rating system doesn't seem to accept less than one star, or I would have given it zero."
3,chiller,"I had to send it back because it would not load on my dvd player, I have seen the movie a long time ago and it's goodMarlene"
2,WARNING! Worst Quality Transfer I've Ever Seen & Heard!,"It should be against the law to sell,such a lousy quality transfer! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!I mean just about inaudible many times. I had never heard of this movie,and I enjoyed the story,if it just wasn't ruined by that terrible sound and picture I would have given it 5 stars,and it would rank as a favorite horror film! The picture quality is horrendous as well,dark and grainy!"
2,"Didn't care for the ""hero""","Sara Craven has written many, many excellent books. I was looking forward to reading this. Unfortunately, this one didn't appeal to me. I didn't care for Ross. It seems that things about Jenna that made him fall in love with her, her innocence for one, also made him back away from her.I also didn't care for his character. According to him, he slept with one woman -- even though he didn't like her -- because he found her in his bed (before he was married). He slept with another woman, after he was married, because his marriage was in trouble and this woman was kind to him.I can't imagine a happily ever after for them. The next time there are bumps in their marriage (and there will be -- since no relationship is perfect), he'd probably find another excuse to sleep with someone else.I'll continue to read Sara's books -- since she is such a great writer. But, save yourself some money and skip this one."
1,bad read!!!,"This story is unbelievable! I didn't like the heroine for taking the blame for the breaking of the marriage and the hero... well, what can I say but: ""what a SCHMUCK!"" He wants to talk and get back together AFTER the divorce (and some years) because they have some unsolved issues!!!! He put the blame for the cheating not entirely on the heroine, but nearly and the stupid woman took it!! Instead of asking him: ""what would you have done if I looked for solace and ""understanding"" with some other nice guy???!!!"" Men like these always think that the world revolves around them! Get real!!No woman with self respect would take this chauvinistic pig back!!!"
4,The Marriage Truce by Sara Craven (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:Jenna is happy to be her cousin's bridesmaid, but she wishes someone had warned her that the best man is going to be dynamic photojournalist Ross Grantham. The man she once exchanged marriage vows with - in the very same church! It's been two years since she last saw him, two years since Ross betrayed their vows. Can they call a truce for the bride's sake? And what about their own marriage - and the bewitching sexual desire that still has her and Ross in its grip?"
4,Cold Warning,"Disc One of this set is flawless. One of the best Numan recordings bar none. Disk Two is slightly less perfect, but still worth the low price, by itself. Think of it as an ""extras"" collection for a great concert. This concert weaves together some of the best moments from the later Beggars Banquet albums and the first Numa album, ""Berserker"". The recording is a bit raw, but this increases the enjoyment."
5,Inspiring,"For those (like me) who thought that Gaudi was the penultimate Spanish architect (I placed Calatrava a close second), this book is an eye-opener. The work here is amazing and hopefully will lead to more being written about these somewhat unsung heroes, especially Lluis Doménech i Montaner."
5,Well Done!,"I enjoyed this CD immensely. Andre Previn does a fine job as soloist and conductor. The piano concerto in F is seldomly recorded, so it's an excellent and rare addition to my collection."
1,DO YOU NEED TO BE A CLASSICAL AFFICIONADO TO LIKE THIS ONE?,I'M AFRAID I DEDFENITELY DO NOT LIKE THIS CD-IT'S VERYBORING TO ME. I LOVE ALL PIANO AND ORCHESTRA MUSIC BUTI'M AFRAID THIS IS THE WORST I HAD TO PUT UP WITH. SORRY-I JUST DID NOT FIND ANY REDEMEEING QUALATIES IN THIS ONE.
4,Dead Creek,"The story has lots of characters and many twists and turns. It is a bit long for this type of mystery, but it does keep you reading. I recommend reading all of the Loon Lake mysteries in the order they were written, so some long term plot endings are not ruined for you."
5,Loved them all,"Very enjoyable mystery series. I love the outdoor setting, the stories and the excellent characters. I wish there were more in the series."
2,Ok,"I really wanted to read all the books in this series, but I just don't think I'll be able to. They all sound the same. It's a good read, if you just want a way to pass the time. Not a nail biter that leaves you hanging, like I enjoy. I started with the first one, and I think this is #3."
2,hard to get thru,"read these fishing books but this one is hard to get thru for me. and do read alot of books,like to keep the story light and simple,to have a way to get away from everyday stresses is the big plus for reading!"
5,realkly gripping,"I just love reading all the loon lake mysteries, love the gripping thrill and how Lew and Doc really find the bad guys and Ray too, I cant put them down, I have a number of the look lake books and a few more to read!"
5,Dead creek,Looking forward to the next book by herCan't wait to get it here or in book form from the lib.
1,doesn't work,this dvd will not play at all. i contacted amazon and haven't received a response. i will say this is the very first problem i have had with them in all the years i have been ordering.
3,the fiddler's fiddler,"There is a review of this cd currently on line with amazon written under my name that I definitely did not write. I played fiddle with Bill Monroe in the 1960's and I learned to play by listening to Chubby Wise and Benny Martin recordings, also to Vassar Clements. They were all innovators, and I have great respect for what they did for the music and the instrument. I have nothing but admiration for Benny Martin's most recent recording. While it does suffer a bit from technical difficulties, to have come back from the trials and tribulations that Benny describes openly and honestly in the liner notes to this work, and rallied the support of his friends and admirers to work with him is worthy of great respect. This work is a great accomplishment for Benny, and a testament to his determination and resiliency."
4,...,"This is a way above average video from Playboy, which in the past has disappointed with tame scenarios that starred second string models (not playmates) with less than revealing lighting and boring sex. They've got a ways to go yet, but this is a good start: lots of playmates, naked most of the time, and what I think is a first, a playmate of the month in a lesbian scene... Is there more footage? Show it!"
5,RICO REED ORDER,"IVE USED THESE REEDS FOR YEARS, THE ORDER CAME THROUGH JUST LIKE I ORDERED AND THE PRICE IS VERY COMPETITVE.I WAS ACTUALLY SUPPRISED TO SEE THESE FOR SALE AT AMAZON."
2,Not the perfect aid to better grades,"This is not a book which correctly solves problems in a heat transfer course. Much less ""fully"" solving problems. My biggest letdown in this book is in the manner the authors solved some of the problems in the book. Specifically problems dealing with the Biot modulus for a carbon steel sphere. It incorrectly lists the formula to solve for this type of object. It also does not show how to solve for the Biot modulus using the graphs provided. This book also incorrectly lists a method to solve for the amount of time needed to cool a heated sphere. Studying these incorrect methods caused my exam to drop a letter grade. I do not recommend this book to anyone trying to grasp the concepts in a heat transfer course. I suggest to save your money for something else that may help."
1,disappointing and misinformed,"While this book has some great tips and some good info, I was appalled by the misinformation in the section on breastfeeding and how negatively it was presented. For instance, you don't have to have a stellar diet and there's very few foods MOST breastfeeding moms have to worry about at all. Overall, I would not recommend this book to anybody who has any interest in breastfeeding, or wants to read a book with correct health information."
1,***DANGEROUS HARMFUL ADVICE!!!!****,"Please don't buy this book.She advises you to shoot the medicine from a baby's medicine dropper into the back of the baby's throat (even after she says it's mean)! PLEASE DO NOT do that! It's not only mean, it's dangerous!Your baby can aspirate and die. Meaning: The fluid could be forced down into their lungs instead of esophagus. They can die from this. Shoot it into their cheek so that they will swallow it the way they should.I also have to add that her other advice annoys me.What she found ""unnecessary"" I found quite useful!"
1,Not the kind of Mom I want to be!,"Althought the author made some good attempts at humor, I would not want to be the type of mother she describes. I was shocked at the way she dismissed the AAPs recommendations regarding feeding and she provided a lot of information that was completely incorrect! The idea that babies should be put on schedules is inconsistent with my view of motherhood. It seems selfish and immature. [...]"
1,Funny? Sure. Informative. NO,"If you want a book that is just for laughs, read away. If you are looking for great parenting info to help you be the best, caring mom you can be, run far from this book. It encourages you to be selfish and uncaring to the needs of your baby. Babies need their mothers. Good mothers do not need this book."
1,Just another rip-off.,"As the author of the Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy, I was online checking out the competition and happened upon this title. Since my first Girlfriends' Guide was published around 1995 with six other Guides of similar titles following in the subsequent years and as recently as Jan. 2007 with the Second Edition of the Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy, I am now accustomed to being ripped off in one way or another, but it is always the girls who live in my backyard who try to capture the Girlfriends' Guide 'tude and flavor that really chafe my hide. Modern Girl's Guide? Hello? Is the eureka moment of inspiration really so rare that we need to rip off our successful sisters? No one was writing Girl's or Girls' guides to anything except perhaps camping until 1995. Is it just serendipity that brought so many other mother writers to this neck of the woods or were the camp signs already up and clearly marking the way? vicki iovine"
1,"Should not be in the ""Parenting"" section of bookstores...","Rather, it should be in the humor section, if anywhere. Half of the ""advice"" given is just plain bad - is it meant to be sarcastic? It sure seems to be. Yes, you need a sense of humor as a mother, but to have a book that claims to be a ""guide"" or give advice and have it in the Parenting sections of bookstores... that's not right. The breastfeeding advice is poor, and it contains offensive misconceptions such as, ""If you are LUCKY enough to stay home...""I think this book exists in order to give ""modern"" moms something to read so they can claim they've read a book on parenting."
5,Sabotage vs. Sanity,"I'm glad I didn't read the reviews here before I bought this book at a bookstore - it has been a wonderful companion to read before my son was born and especially now that I have new questions and difficulties with each day as he grows. I have several books I refer to, but this one stays on my bedside table. It is insightful, witty, and encouraging - unlike many of the comments on these reviews that seem to have been sabotaged by some self-righteous breastfeeding clan. The breastfeeding portion is a tiny portion of the book and it encourages you to do what's best for BOTH you and the baby. If you want to breast-feed, it offers helpful suggestions. If you can't, it offers solutions. I recommend this book to all my friends, no matter what their parenting style is. Ignore the sabotages and let the sanity begin!"
1,"If being modern means being a bad mom, then call me old fashioned!","WoW just WoW!!! The breastfeeding advice in this book is horrible. And the author advocates making your child cry it out. The front cover has bottles on it and a pacifer shoved in the poor baby's mouth, so hopefully anyone who is interested in breastfeeding avoids this book!"
1,Absolutely terrible,"I couldn't read most of it, because she put me off so terribly. She disregards most medical recommendations, and acts as though children are just a burden to deal with. Her information on breastfeeding is beyond sad, it's reprehensible, and not the least bit accurate. Her attitude that children at the ages of 9-12 months are manipulative when crying, and should cry it out is sad, and out-dated, not to mention dangerous to your child's health."
1,totally Disappointed .. makes baby seem like a tiresome accesory,"I was very disapointed in this book. I loved her show .. btu this book was severly lacking.She comes off with a very ""me 1st"" selfish attitude. Like the baby is sopposed to be cute and confrom itself to her life/world.In the section for 9-12 month old she states that if they cry out they are being manipulative. HUH?? What complete malarkey. On top of the inaccurate (medically and scientificly) breastfeeding ""information"" she lost me right at the babies are manipulative part.There's nothing in there about learning you child's cues or meetign thier emotional needs. ...[...]"
1,What bad advice!,"Please, if you are planning on breastfeeding or following your child's cues do not buy this book.The breastfeeding advice she gives is just plain wrong and uninformed. Get yourself a copy of ""So That's What They're For!"" for amusing, inspiring and CORRECT advice about nursing."
1,"No stars for this ""What to Expect"" wannabee","Yikes, but this book is goddawful! If you are vapid, self-absorbed and not terribly bright, you may find the advice contained between its covers helpful - or if you're a fan of the ""What to Expect"" series (but I repeat myself). Breastfeeding information is inaccurate, nine month old nifants who cry are termed ""manipulative"" and the super-duper-handy tips offered up (use egg cartons to hold your kids paints! feed a stuffy baby in a steamy shower!) are ripped off from old issues of Family Fun magazine. Nothing orginal or interesting here."
1,Modern? Hardly.,"If it's meant to be funny, it isn't. The ""advice"" is terrible and I can't find a single original thought in the book.The idea that this book is for the ""modern girl"" is laughable since most of the author's advice is the same advice my mother was given in the 1970s. And yeah, big shocker here- things have changed since then.There are similarly styled books out there that are actually funny and still have decent and recent advice.Skip this one."
4,cute and funny!,I've read most of this book so far and it would have been great to have when I was pregnant. My baby is almost 10 months old now and there is still info in there that was useful but alot of it was what I needed to know earlier. I loved her style of humor and the way she tells it like it is!
3,Too large,I have the silicone strip for a tummy tuck by this same company and loved it so I ordered the breast piece. I ordered two of them and when I received them I couldn't believe how large they were. They are just so big that I had to cut them down to fit and even cut them apart in order to make them fit right. The lower part is about 3.5 inches wide. Just too wide. I really don't see how that is necessary. Plus they are that comfortable. But I spent the money and so I cut them to fit and will wear them because I liked my tummy tuck strip. I would have been better off spending the money on another tummy tuck strip and cut it to fit my breasts.
4,BEAUTIFUL WORDS,"This was the first Ellis Peters novel I have read. I understand that she continues the Cadfael series, and I would be interested in checking out the other books. Brother Cadfael was an interesting mix of the world (due to his previous life outside of the ministry-as a soldier) and the Spirit. He was very smart, but was not my favorite detective. The thing I loved the most about this book was Ellis Peters' descriptions about people and situations. The description that struck me the hardest was the one of the woman's body Brother Cadfael found in the beginning. I'd like to conclude by saying that the historical information was invaluable as well. A mystery with a historical context is something I thoroughly enjoy!"
2,more gothic romance than historical mystery,"At her best, Ellis Peters can write a solid mystery in a fascinating medieval setting. this did neither. More gothic romance than historical novel. Very phony plot and characters. everything seemed exaggerated. Annoying attitude on author's part of hero worship of upper class, warrior values, the romantic Arab. Cloying. I agree with the reviewer who found it slow and boring. I got to the end only by skimming the last quarter very quickly. there was a lot of wordy repetitive prose to no effect. Cadfael is usually appealing because of his mature attitude towards life, but here he just seemed to good to be true. the medieval background lacked life and believability."
3,Walking,"These are good walking tapes EXCEPT I wish she would shut up a little more and let me walk with the beat. They are good in that there is a warm up, aerobic walking and a cool down. That said--she talks way too much."
5,A piece of history,"Celebrating two of America's most influential musical cities, this CD set has brought together some of Motown and Philly Soul's musical heavyweights. The result is a glorious 2+ hours of sonic surprises. The Funkmaster, George Clinton, crooning through ""Love Won't Let Me Wait""; Bunny Sigler and Jean Carne's sizzling rendition of the Rick James Classic ""Fire and Desire""; Freda Payne's melting version of 'Betcha By Golly Wow; or Phil Hurtt's big band rendition of 'The Girl's Alright' - with the Funk Brothers and/or MFSB on all 30 tracks. Unbelievable stuff! 'Soulful Tale' proves that these artists are still in the prime of their careers. It's a shame that we don't hear music like this on the radio anymore. The world is missing something by not embracing this piece of American pop history."
5,Awesome Childrens Book,Chris Robertson debut is an acomplishment. The story is educational but not overbearing. The art is original while keeping within the recognisable features of one of the most famous monuments in the world. All in all an excellent book! I would build a lesson plan off of it if I taught the right grade.
2,Napkin Folding for EXPERTS only,"If you are experienced in napkin folding and already know the folds, then this book may be useful to you. It does picture many beautiful folds,However, if, like me, you are a novice, then don't waste your money. This book has few photos, unclear written instructions, and fails to show the details of how to get from one step to the next. It is bound to frustrate novices. It annoyed me so much that I am removing this book permanently from my book shelves, lest I try to use it again."
4,Altec Lansing Does It Again...,"Altec Lansing is well respected name in the Computer Audio industry. This speaker set-up lives up to the name, I am happy listening with these speakers from everything to music, to surround sound video games!"
5,Launching Pad For a Career,"This was an amazing documentary that I saw not long ago. I have always wanted to be a marine biologist and then I saw this movie and knew exactly what I had to do. This movie is fantastic with rare footage of live deep sea creatures uninhibited and fully entrenched in daily activities. This not only gives you an idea of what deep sea creatures look like, but amazingly shows predator/prey interactions (though some of that was dramaticized, it was entertaining none the less). Now working with one of the contributing scientists from the movie, I watch this every time I sea it on discovery or animal planet and I'm even more amazed when I see the fish the filmed in person."
5,Ground-breaking!,All other documentaries should aspire to the level of that of the Blue Planet series. By far the most impressive documentary ever put together! Even though the Discovery Channel re-airs these programs; the high quality of DVD sound and audio make this worth paying for it.
5,Great for anyone who loves the ocean,Purchased this for my grandson who got hooked on ocean creatures through Disney's Octonauts. He loves seeing all the sea creatures in this film. Beautifully made. A good buy.
2,helpful but cumbersome,"I bought this brush to clean some mold off the vinyl siding on the back of my house. The brush works great and its nice to be able to control the force of the water comming out. The soap did nothing for me, don't bother with the dispencer. The biggest issue I had was that the hose is very cumbersome to drag back and forth while scrubbing. It makes it tough to use and wera you out a little. The brush did the job in removing the mold just fine, but I found that I had to take frequent breaks."
3,Item footage,I'm looking to see if this recording is what I'm looking for please submitall information and contents before a decision can be made.Thank you.
2,Disappointed,I purchased this item thinking that all required software would come with but much to my surprise I did not! Laptop came with lot of pre-installed program that needs product registration codes. I didn't even get a official Windows XP CD with its registration codes. I wouldn't recommend anyone to purchase a thing from Amazon.com!
4,A refreshing citrus beverage,"This is a great drink that is hard to find in the USA. It is made with Chinotto, which is a fruit somewhere in between an orange and a grapefruit. It basically tastes like grapefruit mixed in with root beer. If you like grapefruit then you will like it. The only reason it only gets 4 stars is that it is too expensive and the bottle is too small, but maybe I'm just saying that because I'm American."
1,Great Product -- For About 5 Months...,"We absolutely loved these after we bought them. My 3-year-old son took one to bed with him every night. One by one, however, they all just died. I would not recommend this product. We did not get our money's worth!!"
2,Good... while they worked!,"We got these as a 2005 christmas gift and used them pretty steadily throughout the year. Well, now, a year later and they won't work. It seems that the base has stopped working.While they did work, they were great for late night diaper changes and for nightlights when we had guests (who couldn't find the switches in the dark). Also used them for occassional mood lighting, but mostly for late night work."
2,Babyage does not treat you well,"The item itself was very enjoyable for my one year old. However, the Babyage corporation was very difficult to deal with. The first one I recieved was damaged and when I tried to return it, it took weeks to even get an answer from anyone. I called 3 times and recieved no return phone call. I e-mailed them numerous times and finally recieved an answer when I threatened to cancel the credit card transaction. Then I finally recieved a new one, but had a hard time finding out how to return the damaged one. The pool is great, if it works, but the company is a pain to deal with."
1,ZERO STARS IS MORE LIKE IT! save your money!,"as you have already read, this pool is a peice of junk! It did not have a drain like the box said. The spraying arch colapsed as soon as the water goes into it. the corners ripped, the tree and basketball hoop do not stand upright. the hole in the tree is too small for the ball to go through anyway. it took forever to inflate, with the fastest pump made! there are 11 or 12 air fill holes. it leaks, ALOT. the kids, 1 and 2, liked it till it was flat on 2 sides and empty...buy something else!"
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This pool is terrible, do not bother buying it. You have to blow it up every day and the palm tree and basketball hoop do not stand it's very disappointing. Don't waste your money."
3,False Advertising,Be warned. I have purchased two of these pools at the local ToysRUs and there is no drain plug on this pool as advertised. Makes it a real pain to drain.
1,dumb,"i think that its not a very cool toy. and it says for kids up to 10? i mean come on! thats not for 10 year olds!and the slide thingy is way too small for even a little kid! i think its a little educational cuz of the activities you can do, but this toy was too boring, not just for me, but for my little brother and sister, who r 3 yrs old!well dont buy this item, its stupid and dumb, you'll b wasting ur time and money."
2,Poor workmanship!,"I bought this pool over the weekend 06-29-03. That same day, 30 minutes after i had filled it up....i notice an air leak on the bottom portion of the pool. Also while i attempted to fix that leak...the arc poped, they had designed the arc to fill with air and water...after it poped it started to deflate and water was everywhere, BIG MESS.We did continue to use the pool without the arc. But i can see the children were disappointed...i attempted to contact the manufacturer to stand by their product...maybe replace it. All i got back from them was tuff luck..."
2,Durability,"My son just received this pool for his Birthday, we blew it up yesterday and it already popped. My Son is just 1 years old and is not very heavy at all.The slide and water spray kept falling down, not to mention we could not keep the palm tree or basketball net to stay up either. The pool is just horrible and I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Summer Fun,"It took forever to blow-up and when we filled it,3 out of 4 corners leaked and the other had a half inch rip. By the end of the day the rip was 3 inches long. Very unhappy. We are taking it back!!!"
4,You get what you pay for,"I bought this pool for my one year old sons birthday party. It did take a long time to inflate but that was expected. The real problem was that the ""rainbow"" that goes over the slide didn't stand up so we couldn't even attach it. There is no drain so the next day I had to drain the pool myself and try to clean it so that we could use it again. It was fun for a few days but I don't expect that I'll want to continue to drain it manually and repair holes for much longer."
1,Tropical Disaster!,"Summer was approaching and I thought that buying this pool that was filled with so many activities, would've been fun for my two boys. I was very happy that It was stated on the box that it came with a drain in the bottom to get rid ot the water. Much to my dismay, after a fun day in the pool there was no drain to let the water out... The pool is now in the storage room in sea of spider webs!"
1,Terrible!!,I brought this for my daughter's first b-day party and was so disappointed when the product was full of holes and so difficult to inflate. The kids were so disappointed. I wish I could of gotten my money back!!!!!!!
1,Leaky mess,This pool did not come with a drain like it said on the box. Nor did it come with directions to hook the water fall on. Also the pool deflated the first time it was used. I would not recommend this pool to anyone!!!!!!
2,one time fun,"It was fun for kids first time. Then there is no way to change water, it was the hassel. After 2-3 times there were many holes everywhere. Tree couldn't stay straight. I am not even talking about hard time to set it up."
1,Very Dissapointing,"This product was terrible. It wouldn't even blow up with the first use! Bought it for a childrens birthday party, and it was very dissapointing! We ended up throwing it away after one use, if you could even call the first use a use!"
1,plasma ball,DO NOT BUY THIS BALLI bought it for my son and i turned it on to test it and it shorted out it turned pink for aboutten seconds then it sparked and broke.D O N O T B U Y T H I S !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Midwest Products Project Woods Balsa Economy Bag,Wood is scrap salvage. Not finish milled. Requires lots of extra sanding to finish. Many pieces starting to split and crack. Don't expect first quality balsa.
2,Hoggyboy's review nails it.,"I am a big fan of Midwest's wood products--the ones sold individually on the rack at the hobby store. Those pieces are always pre-sanded/finished and look/feel great. This bag is full of nothing but rough un-sanded pieces (literally splinters coming off of them at all angles; that bad) which are good for only a few applications where scrap wood is needed. I create enough scrap with normal wood usage so I don't need a bag of scrap. I thought this would be a sampler bag of different wood sizes/shapes and while it is that, they are not of the same quality as Midwest's normal line of wood found at the local hobby shop. I can therefore not recommend this product to anyone looking for anything other than scrap wood pieces."
3,"Definitely an 'Economy"" Bag","If you are into serious hobbies, or anything that requires really high quality wood, I would not recommend this bag at all.It worked okay for what I needed, as I was just cutting up some wood to practice with, but for actual use, it's not really ideal.There were a lot of really large chunks of wood, that you really couldn't do a lot of stuff with. If you're looking for a lot of thin slices, this really isn't your bad. Additionally, I know that balsa wood is generally fragile, but some of the thin strips had already broken by the time I received my package.Overall, this wood wasn't really that high quality. It was very rough, and I've seen a lot better for a little bit higher prices."
1,Overpriced,Very small amount of wood. The product is way overpriced for the amount of wood in the bag. Very disappointed.
2,Lasted one day!,"I previously owned triple feeders from another company. Generally, these feeders had metal perches and feeder ports so they would last for about two years or so. This feeder has plastic parts in the feeder ports and as a result, my squirrels destroyed it in one day. Save your money and buy feeders that have all metal feeder ports. I now buy all-metal feeders and after months, there is not a single bit of damage."
3,Good for the Background,"I bought this not knowing what it would sound like. I heard about it through a site specializing in lounge music. Well lounge... not really....half of it is, the other half, bits and pieces of german actress' and kinda like strip tease music in between. Track 7 ""bunny"" is the best tune, being that it opens with a woman laughing her but off, kinda cool. But the album lacks a bit of real loungy tunes. It's good for a party (in the background maybe),but this does not fit into the ""Easy Tempo"" catagory. Charles Wilp is just strange, but it IS cool, but not cool enough, if you can't HEAR it first, don't buy it."
3,No longer a good reference book for compounders,"I have been familiar with this book since college and really loved it. Now I work in Compounding and can afford it, only to discover that it has very few formulations, does not have a cross index, the page numbers in the index do not match the page numbers in the book and there are very few latin names in use. In my country some physicians still prescribe in Latin or use Latin names. I am very dissapointed in the book, no longer a reference for compounders."
2,Not enough scenery and falling skaters,"Okana was great in this video, but was slightly disappointed that the production didn't have more scenery, Victor wasn't wearing a costume most of the time, and some of the skaters were missing their jumps, especially the Fairy God Mother and one of the toy soldiers. If a skater can't make his/her jump, it should not be attempted in a production."
2,The Nutcracker on Ice,"Look elsewhere if you are interested in specifically seeing the Nutcracker, whether performed in skates or toe shoes. Although most of Tchaikovsky's score is (laszily) played, the skating stars are wasted with indifferent choreography and perfuctory camera work. There is no invention, no tension, no lightness. The production is just dumped there as another Christmas ""special"" to be forgotten on December 26. Believe me, there have been terrific ice productions of this ballet."
4,Joy!,"My almost 4-year old is taking skating lessons and absolutely loves ""The Nutcracker"", whether it is a ballet or an ice show. She demands we put this video on almost every day, and dances to it. We very much enjoy it too! Of course, there is room for improvement, but it is a beautiful production, too bad it cannot be seen live and is not on tour anywhere. The only thing is that it is obvious that all the leading skaters are not pair skaters, all the pair skating elements are pretty much absent. But the show is a delight to watch!"
3,Nutcracker on Ice,Nutcracker on Ice by Oksana and Baiul Is very nice excect that it was spoiled by the Sugar Plum Fairy all through the program!! It should have been kept in its own segment as in the origional delightful story.
4,Good reeds to get you going quickly,"I've played these for years. They have a bright sound, and are relatively predictable. I wish that there was even more quality control for the balancing of the reeds, before the plastic coating is applied. Obviously, you can't shave or manipulate the reed once the plastic coating is applied. But, not having to wet them ahead of time is a big plus for me. They last a long time, and the hardness is very consistent."
2,Sabotage ?,"I was shocked that something like this was ever published. Not because of its incendiary, counter-culturenature, but because frankly - what is passed off as ""Sabotage"", is pretty lame.If you are looking ( as I was ), tales of ingenious treachery and the like, I caution you, most of it takesthe road of :When the boss wasn't looking, I would sometimes read a magazine.orI knew it was the office calling, so I didn't answer the phone.Ooooooohhh.This book did not set my head spinning with what evil lurks below the surface, but rather disappointed me andmade me feel like the real Sabotage was in getting me to spend money to read tales about paperboys not puttingall the supplements in the papers."
5,not just for marxists and anarchy types,"This book is one of a kind, it was put out in the early 90s but the autobiographical essays are still valid. The quotes and newspapers tidbits are fanatastic as well. Format is reader friendly. If you have any interest in the working class, or human resources for that matter this book would be enlightening"
1,Don't Buy!,"Sure my Akai was great for two years. But now it won't turn on. Just Google ""AKAI won't turn on"" and you will find so many AKAI customers with the same problem, and Akai support will not respond. There are many people begging for class action against the maker."
3,ok tv but nothing special,"This tv is convenient because of the built in dvd player but it only has an ok picture. The black levels are poor and become washed out at times. I use it in my personal gym while doing cardio so it's ok for that purpose, but I wouldn't want it for my main tv. The picture just isn't good enough. I'd say the best thing about this tv is the price!Also, I hear the slight buzz people mentioned but it doesn't bother me enough to warrant a return."
1,BUZZZZZZZZ,"I purchased this TV from Costco last month and had to return it. There was such a pronounced buzzing coming from the set. You do get what you pay for! Save your time and money on this set. I even tried hooking it up to external speakers, but the hum wasn't coming from the speakers. Very Annoying!"
1,BBB gave Akai an F,"I've been waiting over a month for customer service on a dead screen. Do not buy Akai. Ask the Better Business Bureau.--update--Akai finally found a service center to pick up the TV. The guy was great and was in contact with me the whole time. Unfortunately, Akai took months to get him schematics for the power supply, which wasn't broken. They wouldn't give him anything else. Akai did call Sam's club for us and let us return the TV. STAY AWAY FROM AKAI!"
4,Don't buy this from Amazon,"Amazon sold this as new, but it was either used or refurbished. (The packaging was not in new condition.) The TV is good, but there is a constant buzzing noise from the speakers. Can be easily mounted using Peerless mount."
1,Very Unhappy,"I bought this TV because of the good price and since I had purchased another product from this electronics company many years ago that I was pleased with. But that was a mistake! This TV experienced a power supply failure after only a few months of ownership. I spent $150 to have it repaired, but within 60 days, the power supply failed again. So, now I have invested more than a name-brand TV would have cost me in the beginning. I have had a similar experience with another ""cheap brand"" of TV recently, so this will be the last ""low-cost"" special for me. I will stick to Consumer Reports advice of buying a name-brand that has a proven track record."
5,"a very very underrated band, that shoulda been big.","I just got this wonderful CD, mine though had 3 disks. The 3rd was a bonus disk. Anyway, Iced earth is AMAZING live, these disks prove it. Heres some good points of this live album:- Great song selection, nice tunes they chose out of their archive.- great production, best live CD i heard. (2nd being Wrecking your neck live by Overkill)Infact this CD wants me to hear em live more-so then before, truely a great live album. THIS IS THE BEST LIVE ALBUM I HAVE HEARD.PERIOD.the production is just amazing, i have heard some pretty good live albums, but this takes the cake. Alot of songs on here, i liked live more then not.I wish i could go over every single song on here and tell u its good points, but theres so much here. If your already a fan of iced earth, u would definately LOVE it. If you are not, its still a great place to start out, i started out on this live album actually. I then became a huge fan, it has a great selection of their songs."
5,Simply fabulous.,"I know Iced Earth since two or three months and i'm already a big fan! Alive In Athens is purely a masterpiece, and is going to become a classick. All the song are better and more powerful then the original, and thanks to Mattew Barlow for his voice, he's simply one of the best singer of today."
5,Definite Live Collection!,"Iced Earth never fails to please me. This is THE live album, the live album that ranks up there with Decade of Aggression, Live After Death, and Live Scenes from New York. Everything about it is energetic and intense, and Iced Earth are one of those rare bands that sound just as good live as they do in the studio. No studio overdubs here, folks, just all out unadulterated metal.Anyone new to Iced Earth should start here, just dont drool on the amazing artwork."
5,Can anyone say Perfect?,"I'm not going to babble on and on about this CD for many have already babbled. What i'm going to say is that this album is a great live album. Instead of getting 1 studio album or getting a best of collection, just get this album (similar to Iron Maiden((Live After Death))). Amazing. Only Iced Earth has the bravery of playing a 16+ minute song! More amazing riffs, half or whole ballads, long epics, short shredding solos to longer more melodic ones, this is a perfect album in all aspects. A Must have for any not just metal fan, but music lovers in general. Get This album NOW!!! Quit out of Amazon and look online for your closest music stores info! SEE IF THEY HAVE THIS. ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL"
1,Video quality worse than vhs.,The video quality of this disk is horrible. At anything other than close-up range the actors are barely recognizable blurs.
1,Terrible video quality.,"Don't get ripped off! Nowhere in the title description does it say this movie was recorded in the EP mode. Try watching the pitiful transfer of this movie and you'll end up going to the eye doctor. Pictured on the cover is Brooke Shields in a swimsuit - enough to make want to buy the tape - right? Well if you like Brooke Shields captured on video using a camera with its lens smeared with Vaseline, then this movie may appeal to you. I've always had the opinion that anyone selling a VHS tape should clearly state whether it was recorded in the SP, LP, or EP mode. Why buy a movie if you can't sit through it because of poor visual quality? This tape goes in the trash tomorrow (pickup day) or maybe I'll save it for Christmas and hand it over to somebody I don't like. At least I'll save on the return postage."
3,Nice underwater scenes,I bought this movie just for the underwater scenes. Brooke Shields is beatiful in most scenes but overall the movie is not worth seeing if you are not a SCUBA or Brooke Shields fan.
4,Very quiet watch winder!,"Overall, this seems to be a good product for the price. The unit feels a little light and cheaply made but it seems to work perfectly so far and is SUPER quiet. I'm happy with the product at this point."
2,Doesn't wind kinetic watches,Works fine for automatic watches such as the Rolex but does not seem to have the necessary motion to wind the kinetics like the Seikos.
1,Good while it lasts,"Bought one over three months ago. It ran quietly at first, now it's making a lot of noises. So loud i have to put it in my garage so I won't hear it spinning. Amazon won't allow me to return this item or exchange for a new one because its past three months. Now I'm stuck with it.I guess i would have to save money and buy a real watch winder."
1,"Runs for a day, then stops","I bought two, so it's very unlikely that both products suffer from the same defect. Winder runs when I plug it in, then doesn't seem to run thereafter. I have to unplug it and plug it in again for it to start up again. As such, this winder does not do its job. Others have reported similar problems."
4,handy,"This gadget is so cool. I got this because my husband needed something to keep his nice watch ticking due to it running off of movement power, and you put the watch in and it will run I believe for an hour then off for 3 hours and so on, it is very quiet and fits into any nook due to it's small size. I am glad I found it."
1,watch winder,My Froogle search for a bi-directional watch winder yielded a link to this item. My Rolex requires alternating (bi-directional) rotation. This unit has two choices: clockwise or counter-clockwise by use of a selector switch. That is not automatic.The merchant was unsatisfactory. I had to dispute the credit card charge when they failed to credit my account a week after they had received the merchandise.It is doubtful that I will ever again buy through Amazon merchants. These clowns apparently operate out of a closet as a hobby.
1,Doesn't work,"I have a heavy Baume and Mercier watch...I made the mistake of purchasing this winder to save some $. Looks very nice on my dresser, but the winder is useless and does not wind the watch at all. Maybe this winder will work for lighter watches?"
4,"VERY GOOD, very quiet run very smooth,","Its been a month now the winder is very good so far, it run very smoothly and quiet. It's not too big it fit perfectly on top of my desk."
4,Very Pleased!,This is the second electronic watch winder I have owned. The last one lasted approximately 1 month and was worthless. I am very pleased with the one from Amazon. It actually works and starts it's winding cycle as advertised. I can recommend this product with a clear conscious.
3,It works...,This watch winder is made out of plastic looks cheap but it does the job of winding my watch. You get what you pay for.....
3,Watch Winder,Works ok but rotates to slowly and does'nt stop the automatic watch winding down and eventually stops
1,Nice dress but quality not worth a penny!,"My puppy maltese only got to where this once and shortly after the furs tore off. It was so dissappointing because it was so darn cute! But really for the price not worth it when you could only wear one time. She did not tear it off, bc she is too puppy and timid in nature.And no, she didnt even know how to bite on her toys yet. I only put it on her when I had my eyes on her for a little photo session. So please dont look at my puppy as the one who to it off. It came off as I tried to dress her and undress her. Very upsetting!"
4,"Good Idea for a costume, a little flimsy","Costume was a treat for my superman fan, at age 3 he was a bit to small for the costume, but that didn't matter for him. The button to hold the entire costume on the back of his neck popped off the second day."
3,It's loud!,"It looks nice, fit and finish is better than average, and it howls under the hood when you're wide open at higher RPM.I haven't noticed any mileage increase or discernable power increase however.Did I mention it's really, really loud?"
3,"Works OK, best of the sprays","When I finally got this (it took a year), it worked OK.I've tried a lot of ways to see the impact point on a golf club. Apparently, this is a difficult problem. I have 4-5 brands of impact tape. I've tried 2-3 types of spray paint, 2 cans of spray chalk, 5-6 types of tape from the hardware store (masking, painters, electrical, etc.), and a couple of kinds of powder from the kitchen (flour, cornstarch) with and without water.This is by far the best of the sprays. The main complaint about sprays is that they are messy and they leave a residue. This one is less messy and leaves less of a residue. Overall, I probably prefer the tapes."
3,a little noisy & large,when it answers your call the motor is a bit noisy. I was surprised at how far the bar stuck out on the back. It made it so I had to find a new place on my desk to put my phone to accommodate the extra length. it does work though.
1,Not the book I expected,"For a book put out by Writer's Digest Books, I expected a little more help for the ""average Joe"" writer who is trying to write a murder mystery for the first time. This is not the book for that writer. The subtitle to this book is ""How polic take homicide from case to court."" So, like most people, I expected it to pick up at the scene of a murder and go from there. Instead, I got a book that was only 187 pages long--many of them photographs--that only got to the meat of the investigation process at Chapter 4 (which, by the way, is on page 114!) The bulk of the book is devoted to the author's in-depth knowledge of the history of certain serial killers. I didn't need this information, and I don't suspect many other writers do, either. What I'd hoped for was a book about the investigative process. Little of this book is devoted to that. I wish I'd done a little more investigating myself before I'd bought it."
4,For Your Information,"Please be aware that this video was released in 2001 under the title ""Denise Austin-Shortcuts-Arms & Shoulders"" just in case you already own the original and you thought this one was different. Reviewer comments on this video are also logged under the original title."
5,Streamlined way to fast toning,"This is an excellent tape for people who have been out of the workout zone for a while. There are three levels of workouts - each one lasting between 10-15 min. The first two are designed to build up your strength for the third one which is pretty challenging. Denise knows the areas that women want to work on and knows the excercises to get results. I know a lot of people can't stand Denise for various reasons... her constant talking with ""that voice"" seems to be a big one, but I find her to be informative and motivating. I like how she points out the correct form and give tips while her back ups perform the excercises. I've only ever owned five pound weights but did go out and buy 3 pound weights because a few of these excercises were a little much using the heavier ones. I highly recommend this tape for people who don't have a lot of time to work out and want to see fast results in their upper body."
2,Wish I had not bought this.,"I guess studio time must be very expensive, cause Denise Austin rushes through the exercises like the set is on fire. Maybe if she had cut down the intro, there would have been more time for exercising.It seems a little disjointed with the constant change from floor to standing exercises. Before you can get to the floor, the exercisers are on rep 2 or 3. Then it's back up again.There's a lot of talking going on, with exhortions to ""sqeeze, sqeeze, sqeeze!"" Perky is an understatement."
2,"Great Routines, Too Fast Moves","This video has some very effective routines, but the moves are performed much too fast for safe form. Because they are done so fast, injuries can incur. She starts out slowly but quickly go into, what she calls, super sets. I have several videos, and that is definitely not the proper way to super set. Normally, you could modify the moves by performing them slower, but, because they are time crunch workouts (about 10 minutes each segment), you really don't have the time to do that. Definitely, not one of her better videos. The routines are easy, but because of the improper form used, not recommended for the beginner, as it could do my damage then good. If you are a Denise Austin fan (even though her voice is a bit annoying and this is not one of her better videos, she's still a great instructor), try one of her Hit The Spot segments."
3,OK,"THIS VIDEO ISN'T AS BAD AS EVERYONE SAYS IT IS. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT YOU TO BUY HER PRODUCTS OR NOT. I PASSED BY A LOT OF STUFF BECAUSE OF WHAT PEOPLE SAID. TRUE, IT IS QUICK ROUTINES THAT IS BECAUSE SHE ONLY HAS 10 MIN. THE FIRST TWO ROUTINES, BUT IF YOU FOLLOW HER INSTRUCTIONS YOU'LL SEE RESULTS."
1,A total waste of money,"Hewlett Packard No. 11 Magenta PrintheadMy HP printer called for a new printhead, so I obliged and spent the $35.00. But when I installed it in my printer it didn't work. It was still asking for a new printhead. Rather than spend another $35.00, I decided to buy a new printer instead. So for $199.95 (plus the money I waisted on the printhead) I now have a new printer with all new printheads."
4,Cogito Ergo Sum,"Descartes is reasonably approachable for a philosopher - and he discusses his theory on being ""Cogito ero sum"", as well as the proof for the existence of God. If you are in to philosophy, this is a good read."
5,Came in good shape and cheap,"I paid so little for it and I only needed Meditations. Good deal, would buy again. A little beat up around the edges but nothing significantly problematic."
4,Descartes as founder for the founder of existential thought,"Even though the writings and musings of Descartes are now universally regarded as being wrong, he's still a worthwhile read. Literally thousands of well-respected critics to his first philosophy created their own philosophies. Mightn't you? Hmmm? Hmmmmmm? Regarded as the founder of Modern Philosophy, the writings of Descartes have been used to bring us to the post-modern writings of Lacan, Camus, and Bernard Tapkis of Tallahassee, FL. I think therefore I am? Sure, a logical fallacy...but, I'll be ...if I would have thought of it on my own."
4,This is a really pretty leash that works quite well,"This is really a nice leash. I have had other retractable leashes that on return burn your fingers and hurt, this one has a ribbon so it does not do that. You are easily able to hold on to it at any point and not get your finger hurt by burning or rapping around your finger. I love the way it retracts . Also , I have the pink and red model, and is it really quite pretty . Once in a while the leash has gotten knots in it, but so far, I have been able to easily fix it. I wish I could find an even longer one in these colors."
3,"Some good info, but biased against FSBO.","This book contains some very good advice if you are able to weed out the almost embarrassingly biasede pro-realtor misinformation.Pros: Good info on writing ads, what to do--and not to do--when preparing the home for sale.Cons: Biased and untruthful information for FSBO sellers, concentrates whenever possible on how difficult it is for FSBO to succeed without the special care that a professional real estate agent can bring to a sale. It would be laughable if it weren't intimidating to first time FSBO prospects.If you can get past the manipulative realtor hype, there's good info here.Don't pay full price for this one unless you aspire to being a realtor or are related to one."
1,Expert of Real Estate BS and Nothing More,"Total waste of time. Has a few trivial points on dealing with realtors. Buy Effros book on ""Sell Your Home in 5 Days"" if you want to go the FSBO route. I am an investor who owns 40 residential properties. This book will go on my shelf as minor reference because I maintain a library. I only recommend this book if you are so shaky in the knees that you are affraid of trying Effros round robin auction on your home."
3,Good as far as it goes...,"Thich Nhat Hanh interweaves many Buddhist teachings, as he understands them. Many of the teachings are very useful. Unfortunately, he does not have nearly as in depth an understanding of psychology as he thinks he does. The glowing reviews come from other Buddhist practitioners who also lack a psychological background. Many people seem to like his approach, as it avoids much of the work that needs to be done to fully understand the roots and manifestations of early trauma. Learning to relate in new ways takes a lot of work and experienced professional help, which can be combined effectively with Buddhist meditation."
2,Where's Saddam? The answer is we've got him!,"This book was funny, but as of today, outdated. I am sure its price will go down now, as it quickly becomes a piece of nostalgia. It will be fun to have around for novelty's sake. Good for future generations to show them the debate that was going on in this country."
1,More baloney from Mr.Goodman,"This book is yet another vain effort to valorize the failed fad, whole language, by providing an alleged model of language and reading based on alleged research. The only problem is, serious research conducted by disinterested researchers shows that whole language basically does not teach many children to read. It is especially malignant when it is used on our most vulnerable children--disadvantaged children--for whom direct and explict phonics instruction is almost a necessity. The self-pitying style of whole language writers (complaining that researchers and politicians are against them) is too ironic to imagine. Who weaps for children made illiterate by whole language? Certainly not its advocates and purveyors."
3,Very Fine...But Not the Reference Standard,"It seems to be the consensus of music reviewers around the world that THIS is the recording of the Symphonie to own. I have to respectfully part with that orthodoxy. While Davis coaxes some very fine playing from the world-class Dutch musicians, the reading seems a little musty to my ears. The interpretation that gets the blood racing (and that's what this music is all about) is the 1968 Bernstein/NY Philharmonic [NOT his 1961 first recording and DEFINITELY not Bernstein's abominable 70's recording with the French National Orchestra]. Regrettably, this recording on Sony/Columbia is now out of print. The conductor and orchestra are in total synch on this potboiler and the audio engineering is excellent. The execution (particularly in the March to the Scaffold and Witch's Sabbath) is utterly hair-raising. If you can find this in the cut-out bins, GRAB IT! No finer recording has been made in the last 30 years."
1,Poor Quality product even a dog would pass on,"The dog lead looks cool and seems to look comfortable but it really is not. The handle is made for a small hand, the lead constantly gets stuck inside and you have to push the lock button a million times to free it. By that time your pet will either be too far away chasing other dogs or standing beside you choking until it finally releases. Not an item any dog owner should purchase. spend the extra $10 and buy a good quality lead. This item is a pass by far."
4,"Excellent value, supported by VOIP providers","We purchased a half-dozen of these for my startup because they're supported by Vocalocity (our VOIP provider), had the features we want, and the price was right. It's a solid, few-frills, get-the-job-done VOIP phone. Excellent sound quality, and it's attractive on the desk, too.My only complaint is that the phone uses icons (a picture of a hand for ""hold"", a piece of paper with a folded corner for ""setup"") instead of words. At first blush, it's not always intuitive what those icons mean. I understand why Cisco did this (reduced localization costs for a product that can sell in the global market). I almost never read the documentation that comes with electronics, so the first time I needed to place a call on hold, I spent 60 seconds staring at it looking for the ""hold"" button, dumbfounded that it didn't have one."
3,Nice with very low speaker volume,"It works great in all respecr except as a speakerphone. If you need a speakerphone which may be shared by more than one person, this is not a phone for you."
2,Problems with connections,"The phone has two network connections that are not secure, so the slightest movement can dislodge them causing the phone to lose its connection. Phone cord connections are not new and, in fact, the connection to the handset is quite secure, as you expect with phones who have handset and phone line connections. It is absurd and stupid to have these connections so insecure that important calls can be disrupted so easily. I might have rated it too high overall, but most of the electronic features of the instrument have worked OK, so I did not give it the lowest rating. Don't buy if you can find something without this problem."
3,It is an incomplete product,"It is a good product but does not bring the connector, I think the sell deveria include the connector no problem to connect to"
3,intreguing concept.,"Its tells a decent story. Its a great gift idea for those who enjoy medeval themes, and waterhouse's art works."
4,pretty good story,"I enjoyed this book. It is fiction, and the author is pretty clear about it. There is no way to know for sure if Waterhouse had an affair with his model, Muriel Foster, but this book is an interesting take on what may have happened. It is a very light read, very much like a romance novel, with very little historical references. I was fine with that. I often wonder about the beautiful women in the Waterhouse paintings, so this book piqued my interest."
5,Excellent,This is one of those DVDs where every song is brilliant and you get your money's worth. 120 minutes of great music by David Gray. One exceptional track after the other.
4,Summarizing,"DVD Video quality= 6,5/10 (Aspect: 1:85 widescreen, right!!!!)DVD Audio quality (DTS) = 7/10Concert = 8/10Band performance= 9/10David= 8/10Film's Director= 3/10 (pretend to film in original, different way, but instead should be ordinary, as usual)Overall: 7/10, great concert"
4,Gray Matters,"A strong setlist from David Gray at this London show ensures that the two hours plus running time drifts by fairly quickly, however even with bit of banter between songs Gray fails to excite on a personal level. Not to worry. New tracks from Life In Slow Motion, including The One I Love, Nos Da Cariad and Lately make the first half of the show a roaring success, before Gray dips into the multimillion selling White Ladder archive for This Year's Love, Silver Lining and Babylon. A top notch band ensure that even the songs from the comparatively unloved A New Day At Midnight album sound powerful and emotionally charged. Nice one, wobbly head. Also included is a featurette on the making of Live In Slow Motion (directed by U2 affiliate Hamish Hamilton) as well as videos for Life In Slow Motion singles."
1,Poor Service,"DVD arrived and they sent the wrong format knowing that the itewm was going to the United Kingdom, they sent a replacement, excatly the same problem wrong format for the UK. Still waiting after a week for Amazon to rerspond, abysmal service and they still have my money!!"
1,Bad Quality,This DVD has alot of skips so some of our favorite songs were interrupted.I was planning on returning after seeing if it was my DVD player and maybe it needs to be cleaned butmy other DVDs don't skip.
1,CAUTION - NOT for PVC and steel pipe size!,"This PVC compression coupling is only for copper tubing with a 1.66 inch outside diameter (OD). 1-1/2-inch PVC and steel pipe OD is 1.90 inches, almost 1/4-inch larger in diameter than copper tubing. The advertisement does not specify! Why anyone would want to use a PVC compression fitting on 1-1/2-inch copper tubing is beyond me, $16 down the tubes for me because of a very poor listing, one naturally assumes that a 1-1/2-inch PVC compression coupling would fit PVC (and steel) pipe OD, when not specified. Very poor."
2,This is more to the product itself than the anime...,"I just have to say that the anime is really good... my point on this is that the seller is specifying that the disc comes with spanish dubs... which... upon arrival... i notice that is not, is just japanese and english. >( thank god i only ordered one, just to figure this out. If you are looking for a version that has spanish dubs, look somewhere else, that is not here."
5,Heartbreaking,"In this DVD things seem to get more real for Ed and Al. Ed finally becomes a State Alchemist, but once again he faces a huge tragic.Fullmetal Alchemist is one of the most heartbreaking anime's you'll ever watch. I cry every time I watch this DVD.I really recommend you get this, it is very good and one of the best anime's you'll probably ever watch.--Misa Misa"
5,Top notch handles,"Excellent handle, great straight grained stock. Looks like what I used to find in hardware stores, but they quit carrying because not many folks buy adze handfles anymore. I would sift thru those and come up with the best andle, but all three of the ones I bought here were just perfect. Thanks."
2,"Not well written, not tightly edited","I bought this one at a sale for $15 and still think I paid too much for it. Granted, it does cover lots of things, but you would be far better off with the O'Reilly book, ""Essential System Administration"", by Frisch. Do not rely on the reviewed book for much depth, and certainly do not rely on it without another book or someone to lean on."
1,"Good idea, horrible quality!","I have to write a real-world user's opinion to counterbalance Fontana Di Luce Corp ""designlover""'s previous ""review"" of this product that reads exactly like advertising copy. I have owned two sets of Candelas and wanted to love them. The design is attractive and the idea very convenient. The execution (and customer service from Vessel) is abysmal, though. Battery life is terrible. This is an overpriced, useless gimmick."
5,Fabulous Gift Idea!,"These lamps are great and come with a full service warranty from the manufacturer. Purchase them from a reputable source like MUSEUMOFMODERNDESIGN on Amazon since you will receive great customer service!I gave many of these great Candela lamps to my friends and they all love it! The best invention since the wheel! These fantastic portable lamps are a safe alternative to regular candles. These lamps provide a warm, ambient glow that won't blow out in the wind, or set the house afire if left unattended. Equally useful on the dinner table or bedside and late-night jaunts, each Candela lamp stays lit for 5 hours, and takes 16 hours to recharge. Intelligent circuitry makes them turn on automatically when lifted from the charging platter, and start to recharge as soon as they're put back. Plus, the pattended SafeCharge system eliminates exposed electrical contacts."
1,NO STARS for a deadbeat dad!,This book is horrible! It's basically all about how to get out of paying child support. This man is a bad person and he does horrible things to his whole family! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
1,DO NOT SUPPORT THIS AUTHOR,"This man does not pay child support. He has three beautiful girls, an has not contributed anything to their lives. Any money he makes off of these books will go straight to his pocket, as he owes over $600,000 in back child support. Please do not purchase this book!"
4,Dumb but fun!,"For those who like silly and dumb movies, this is the one for you.I'm not saying it was a bad movie, it had it's humor. But don't expect much.Nice to watch when nothing else is on."
2,Not Fantastic,This knife was received in the package with a very poor grind and with a fit and finish far worse than most knives in this price range.
2,Waste of Money,"If you have already made the decision to skip the stress of a traditional wedding, then this book is not for you. This book provides a very broad overview of eloping, but doesn't give you enough information on any topic to be useful. I had really hoped to find a book with timelines, budget tracking and useful tips and ideas. This book didn't have anything along those lines. This book is really designed for someone who hasn't decided to do a destination wedding yet and wants some more information."
5,Peoms For The Soul: Sanskrit of the Body,"A collection well deserving of its award. Like looking into the myriad compartments of the honeycomb, the inventory of images in these poems is overwhelming. From crows descending with snowflakes over disused train tracks to dawn over the Ganges, the cast of images swings over the entire natural and phenomenological landscape. Everything is digested and incorporated here in the production of the honey that is the Sanskrit of the Body. And when you overcome the massive inventory, when you have begun to connect the seemingly disparate elements, and once you are able to step back from the threads to see the tapestry you will find a deft hand that is able to weave even measures of contrasting images in cadences that sway beautifully between hard and soft, dense and sparse language. For those that can appreciate such subtleties, Keckler's poetry quietly serves up a feast wearing amber beads under a sky of calligraphic stars."
4,Easy and Interesting Read,"I was asked to read this book as part of a graduate level operations management class I am taking for my MBA. At first I thought how good could this book possibly be? But much to my surprise it was very good, because of the author's ability to weave a story around among other things, the principles of production and capacity planning. Pretty dull stuff wrapped up in the form of a fast moving, interesting story that can apply to any manufacturing company."
3,The Goal,"Some times it is too infantile and the narrative is boring. Nevertheless, I guess you can relate to real life situations and learn from it."
4,Not bad for a Chilton/Haynes manual,This does not replace Bentley but does have some good information if you happen upon one of these manuals cheap. This is the only one of the these manuals that I have found useful. Some of the exploded views are a mix of different years parts but do get the message across.
2,so-so repair manual,"This manual pales in comparison to the Official VW guide that is also available through Amazon. The pictures are not always very clear (or are simply poorly printed) and the paper feels very lightweight - I would not want to use this in the shop for fear of quickly destroying it.I will mention that this manual did cover one subject better than the official VW Shop Manual, and since I needed that subject, I am glad I picked this reference up. Otherwise, this feels like a Go-Bot compared to the Official VW Manual as a Transformer."
5,delightful music,"Rameau is the most important and best French composer of the whole baroque era. His music still sounds very original to our own days and is revived by baroque expert maestro William Christie. while not all listeners want to start with his masterpeace ""Hippolyte et Aricie"" due to its price and length, this very generous (more than 78 minutes of nusic) CD with the two enchanting acte de ballet are a good starting point to this great composer. In this CD Christie mainatains his high standards in the performance and the choosing of the soloists."
3,"An odd time to say anything here, but...","I haven't even read this book yet. But I bought an early printing over the internet recently, and I just had to let people know about the inspiring cover art. It features a dark haired girl and a boy on a blue background. It's pretty in an old world sort of way. I've not seen many other covers that are painted in this style. Only one set of three books that I own, three early fantasy novels by H.M. Hoover, might be by the same, possibly oriental, artist. I'll check them tonight when I get home. I've got to read the books!"
5,great,"Great transforming mesage, get it you will thanks yourself about that desition, you will notice something great happening inside you."
3,Good sense of place,"Wendi Lee conveys a great sense of place in her private eye story about Angela Matelli and her large Boston-area Italian family. Her brother Albert doesn't show up for the family Sunday dinner and Angela's mother is worried. Since Albert makes his living as a front man for the Mafia, some concern is in order.Although I enjoyed Angela and her family, I was looking for that twist to the mystery plot. While the novel ended up in an exciting climax, there wasn't much surprise about who was keeping Albert, why they were doing it, or what was going to happen next."
4,"""Humiliate people you claim to respect."" - Penn Jillette","This was Penn & Teller's first book, and they made the actual book a prank in itself. Now, I won't give anything away, but the book is designed to drive anybody who reads it ""the wrong way"" batty. Plus, there are stories about how they did a lot of their tricks, including the infamous ""cockroach trick"" that made David Letterman leave his show. Plus lots of other mean stuff to pull on unsuspecting people.Oh, and there's also the full text of the screenplay for ""Penn & Teller Get Killed."" Here's hoping you have good eyes."
2,This tea blows!!!,Not worth the price!!! Has a very bitter taste!!!!! You have to add a ton of honey to it to make it worth a damn. Does not help coat the throat in anyway!!!!!!
2,too sweet,"What do they add? Is it the marshmallow root? (There's no stevia.) This tea has a sickening sweetness all its own. If you accidentally bought it, like me, here's a tip: try adding lemon juice to your cup just so you can use up the box without throwing it away."
2,Schubert in Norman's Care?,"With the exception of 'Der Tod und das Madchen', Ganymed, and Suleika I, Jessye Norman brings an overly exagerated, operatic quality to the Schubert Lieder which is out of place. The lieder works on this Cd do not lend themselves as being intimate or well enunciated as the composer intended. Another loss is the 'Erlkonig' where Norman fails to distinguish vocally the four character voices essential to make the song coherent and dramatic. I have the greatest admiration for Jessye Norman as an opera singer but her Schubert is in need of improvement."
1,Doesn't work,"This item plays the music okay and looks ok but it doesn't light up. The moon doesn't move. I feel like I might have got a dud, but now after reading the other reviews maybe they all are duds. I payed $7 so I won't be returning it. More trouble than it's worth, bit I would not recommend."
2,"Beautiful, but doesn't last.","This is very whimsical and beautiful. The idea is good too, but the moon moved only twice and got stuck after that. Thinking about opening it up to fix, but have not just yet. Music is okay although no volume control and the two modes are cumbersome to select by pressing the end of one of the ""rays"". Overall it's a very neat design which falls short in usability and durability. (And my kids didn't even get to touch it yet.)"
4,Easy to Read,"I bought two versions of this book, the other being in the original English of Foxe. I would recommend this version over the other since it is a lot easier to read, follow and understand. I wish it were hardcover, but it is a good choice otherwise."
1,The Dumbing Down Continues,"Why certain editors feel that it is a moral and worthy act to rewrite classics is really beyond my comprehension as a philologist, author, and editor myself. This was done, horrendously, with MY UTMOST FOR HIS HIGHEST by Oswald Chambers, and now this Chadwick fellow has destroyed FOXE'S BOOK OF MARTYRS in the same way, by rewriting this classic in dumbed-down postmodern English (if it can be called that). The back cover matter even states that he has done violence also to WITH CHRIST IN THE SCHOOL OF PRAYER (Andrew Murray) and THE IMITATION OF CHRIST (Thomas A'Kempis), among others.Stop. Please, in the Name of Jesus, stop. Leave the classics as they stand. You are helping no one by re-writing books written in English easy enough to read already."
1,Make me care.,"Another book about a hot girl with issues. In this case she's extra-hot because she's foreign, and her problems are miniscule. There are no likeable chaacters, the plot is nonexistent. Nothing worse than aiming for edgy and failing miserably."
2,Not Great,"I was looking forward to reading this book. It had a promising summary and seemed as though it would be a great read. When I actually started reading it, I realized that it was not pulling me in the way good books usually do. I kept reading, thinking that after a while it would become interesting. It never did."
1,Rubbishy,"I wanted to like this novel, as I was interested in the subject of youthful delusion and narcissism. However, I found the prose tedious and self-indulgent (just like the protagonist). There seemed to be no direction to the novel, and Lou (the main character) failed to show that any moral transformation was occurring or was likely to occur. What was most disappointing, however, was the banality of the writing, and the inability of the words to elicit emotion, or illustrate a scene.I respect the author's attempt, but unfortunately not much has been achieved here."
3,disturbing,"I don't really know if I truly enjoyed this book or not. I found Lou to be a very angry, disturbed teenager. Sure, she was bright and had some perceptive things to say, but overall she really needed therapy.I think it would have made for a more interesting novel if we had a true perspective of her stay from the viewpoints of her host family. What if the Hardings each contributed a few chapters telling their thoughts on Lou? I can't help thinking they weren't as bad as she made them out to be.I gave it three stars instead of two because I thought the cover photo was fabulous. That photo prompted me to pick up the book in the first place."
5,Excellent,"Hyland utterly convinces us with the voice of sixteen year old Lou, a girl hoping to leave behind a troubled family life in Australia for a piece of the suburban American dream. Lou soon finds that her own bad habits are proving pretty hard to kill though, and that the America she wants is not necessarily the America she's going to get. The book is filled with wry, canny observations and great characterisations, and in its peculiarly dark, placid way is utterly compelling. Profound, gorgeously written and memorable. Well worth your time."
3,Just Ok,"There are some good spots to this book and it carried enough interest (barely) for me to complete it. There are a precious few quirky takes on life that made me laugh and hope for more. But for the most part, it seemed to drone on without much variation.One thought: I tended to think about teenagers and what it was like to go through it and maybe to cut them a break. And also how fragile it is in those years and how you might go either way given influences and environment. It was almost as if Hyland created a calm center around which your own thoughts swirl.That said, the book just never went anywhere and pretty much stopped cold without any resolution. Not that I need a everything cleanly wrapped up, but something, a different feel, a look forward, a decision, something.."
3,So So,"Character development is lacking, and things seem to happen quickly and unexplained. It's not a deep story by any means. Starts out when a boy Shun is headed to school and gets attacked by an alien, it is revealed that he has the ability to open a Gate, a form of power, and he is made captain of the GateKeepers, an all female (save for Shun) team of Gate users that protects the world. The story moves fast and relationships pop out from no where. It's a decent read but much of the story and its subplots go unexplained."
3,Looks Great ... Sounds Not So Great.,"I bought this guitar and was soooo excited to get it.When it got here I was a little put off by it's size. It's smaller than I thought it would be but ended up loving it. The Dragon inlay is beautiful and the guitar is super shiny and looks great.However, the sound is awful. The strings buzz and it sounds really tinny and hollow. I've tried to contact Luna several times to find out if it was defective or any suggestions on fixing the sound but no one has ever responded. Unfortunately, it looks like my cool guitar that I was so excited about will be going back."
4,Funny parts,"I learned some neat things about the author when he was smaller and that he did some very funny things. For example, when he went to Kindergarten and asked when they would be reading and went right home when he heard it would be in first grade. I also liked it when he yelled at the movie screen because the story of Snow White was different than the real story in the book."
2,Not Up to dePaola's Usual Standards,"Tomie dePaola's first attempt at a longer work, 26 Fairmount Avenue, is not up to his usual standards of quality. The telling is dry. The events unexciting to young children. No doubt, however, that this book will likely be popular with dePaola's fans, of which I'm one. There is much biographical information to be gleened from it. However, it reads like an old man's memoir rather than a book for children. Tomie, whose strength is illustration, should stick with what he knows best. Obviously, someone at Putnam's must believe the corporate addage: Greed is good. There is simply no other reason to have published this lackluster title."
4,"Tomie DePaola as a child, first in a series","A great choice for young readers just starting chapter books, and for fans of Tomie DePaola. I enjoyed the chance to learn more about his life, and also about the time period in which he grew up (1930's, 1940's). I teach preschool, and I read this book to my students at naptime~ they love it. As always, DePaola's illustrations are an asset to his story.This book is good stuff. I haven't read any others in the series yet, but I'm looking forward to delving into them."
4,A Great Start to a Series,"This is the story of young Tomie as he waits for his new house to be built. The narrative is easy and light, with fun stories told about school, building a new house, family, and grandparents.This is a great book for upper elementary students to read and a great book for adults to read to younger students."
4,Decent Survey Suffering from its Brief Length,"I'm not certain of the ultimate intent of this work, but I did appreciate the balance exhibited. I would have welcomed a deeper dive into many of the threads and about double the present length."
5,Suze Weinburg,"THE lady is fantastic in this DVD. Suze is knowledgeable. She is easy to listen to and I totally enjoyed the processes, products, and her fantastic ideas. I highly recommend this DVD to any hobbiest."
2,WASTED MONEY,THIS WAS NOT THE PRODUCT FOR ME I TRULY FELT I WASTED MY MONEY. I USED THE WHOLE BOTTLE A LITTLE RESULTS. I TRULY BELIEVE MY WEIGHT LOSS WAS DUE TO CHANGING MY EATING HABITS AND EXERCISE I CANT SPEAK FOR OTHERS I JUST WISH I DID MORE RESEARCH BEFORE I BOUGHT IT.
1,HORRIBLE experience,"I took this for a total of 3 days and I regret every minute of it. I had the worst gas pains and bowels problems, plus my heart felt like I was having a heart attack. It took me a few days to feel better once I stopped taking them. Do yourself a favor...don't waste your time or money."
3,Purchased it a 2nd time...so i must like it!,"I used this product several years ago and got great results.It really seems to ""jump start"" my workout and curbs my appetite.I rated it a 3/5 because it does make me feel a bit nauseous and does cause some stomach pain (I am sensitive to acidic or spicy things, so people like me who are frequently popping TUMS... you may want to stay away from this product.)"
1,Item received was not what was pictured or described,I wanted the item shown and described as the Biotest Fahrenheit Metabolism Breakthrough for Women as I had used it years ago with positive results. What I received was their generic formula in very different packaging and the actual capsules were different as well. I have no idea if they will work or not but after a week of using them I don't see the same initial results as with the other formula. The items are non-returnable and I ordered 2 bottles so I'm basically stuck with them. Very disappointed in Amazon. Normally I have no issues ordering products from this site.
3,"Does work, but not if your on Birth Control","Ok so I bought this Fahrenheit pill for my wedding which is coming up in a month. I started it yesterday and it really gave me energy and helped me with my cravings. HOWEVER... I am on birth control and it has caused break thru bleeding since I have Taken this diet pill. I am not talking spotting, I am saying like MAJOR bleeding. I called my doctor and she said some diet pills cause break thru bleeding. So if you are considering buying this it is great for your appetite, didnt give me any headaches, and didnt hurt my stomach at all ( I have a hernia and everything hurts my stomach- but this didnt) and it made me feel good all day BUT, if your on birthcontrol beware of buying this. I am going to try this for a week and if the bleeding doesnt stop i am getting off of it. :-( I really had so much hope for this."
1,NO NO NO!,Gave me heart palpitations and anxiety that took weeks to go away after I had stopped taking them. I was only taking 2 a day and only for 2 weeks. Completely messed up my metabolism after that. It's taken a lot of work and effort to get my body chemistry sorted out. Don't do it. Seriously.
1,Why can't you leave good enough alone!?,"Why is it when certain drugs become popular, companies think they can change the ingredients?? This used to be so great when it first came out! Now its just junk! It does not do anything!! I believe I first tried this in 2004 and I lost 25 minutes in a couple of months, to the point of my co-workers asking what on Earth was I doing. :) Slowly the pounds crept up on me, and tried this again in 2010 and it did not work! No energy, nothing!! Big thumbs down, the only reason I am writing this review is because I found the half empty bottle in my pantry. What a waste!!"
2,Campy Camp Movie,"I seriously giggled my way through this whole thing. It's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but if you go into it knowing its gonna be cheesy and campy (no pun intended), and don't think you're going to see a masterpiece, you'll be okay. It'll do to pass the time. Honestly, I only bought it for Leif Garrett and I was not disappointed there."
3,slaughterfest!,"its pretty much your typical 80s teen slasher flick, which is just what i was looking for. if you've got bloodlust, it'll quench it. but don't expect any award winning performances."
2,Give Me An- S! Give Me An- H! Give Me An- I!...,"If the sight of a 400lb. man's bare hindquarters terrifies you... STAY AWAY! If the thought of a middle-aged Lief Garrett ""rapping"" fills your veins w/ icewater... STAY AWAY! If foot-tall 80s hairstyles make you cringe in fear... STAY AWAY! Yes, this is CHEERLEADER CAMP, a film full of cheerleading routines that may be too intense for some viewers! Watch as 30yo teenagers fight to survive against an unknown killer among them! See the horror as pom poms swish and shake! Stand astonished during the hideous school mascots' dance-off! Feel the life drain from your body as 88 minutes simply disappear! YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN, YOU ARE DOOMED..."
2,Not worth the hype,"This movie had the potential to be great. Being a horror movie junkie (particulary 80's slashers) I thought from the trailer looked very appealing. The movie has nudity, lots of guts and blood and some good kills scenes but is an overall letdown. The plot is very confusing, the killer is never shown (which totally killed the movie right away)! And what about that 300+ pound gorilla I had to put up with for the whole movie? Oh was he awful haha. Two stars for the nude hotties and the kill scenes but other than that a complete waste of time and money."
2,"Gimmie a C, Gimmie a R, Gimmie a A, Gimmie a P","Whats that spell? Crap. The film is called Bloody Pom Poms but renamed to Cheerleader Camp. I dont know why and it's never fully explained in the booklet. It's a horror comedy but has more comedy with one really good kill. The cast was decent with some hot cheerleaders, of course. They had a fat guy who was funny and seemed to blend in quite well with the cheerleaders. It was a breath of fresh air they didnt make fun of his weight and make him a joke thru out the film. The story has been done countless times before and alot of characters could have added to the story, were misused. Hell I viewed the film once and cannot remember half of it and i'm not drunk or stoned. Well its not as bad as horror films of today, its not one i'd recommend. It suffers from what alot of horror movies suffer from-a cool cover but inside is nothing but crap."
2,Could've been so good...,"OK, this obscure slasher seems promising... good premise, attractive and interesting cast with a few known names, decent budget and effects, a sense of humour and witty, bitchy dialogue. I mean, you'd think a horror flick about competing for cheerleader queen would be a can't miss, no?So where did Cheerleader Camp go astray? In two major areas... pacing and body count. Nothing ever really happens until the ending, and after all the build up, most of the murders occur offscreen! So, basically, there's no payoff. What a waste of a great set-up an an eager, game cast. Don't buy, rent."
4,Bring on the cheerleaders!!,"ANCHOR BAY ENTERTAINMENT does it again with this hard to find horror film that i totally forgot about. I know that i used to own a BETA copy of this movie and then the tape got all stuck in the vcr and it screwed my machine and i had to throw it out!But like a decaying zombie, it's come back from the dead!About the movie, i remember it being very entertaining and had all the things you'd except from a 80's slasher film..cheesy story, some nudity, original kills and twist ending!Can't wait to pick it up when it comes out, and at that price..you should too!!ANCHOR BAY RULES!!!"
3,If 80s slashers are your thing you'll probably love this.,This one's ok. Has some fab kills but overall it doesn't exactly represent the best that the 80s slasher boom had to offer.Betsy Russell is good and tries hard. If you're into this kind of movie you'll probably want to check it out.Go Anchor Bay - thank god these guy exist. How else would we horror fans get our fix of classic flix.Give me a KGive me an IGive me an LGive me an L
3,The Competition is murder at Cheerleader Camp,"The Lindo Valley squad arrives at Cheerleading Camp to compete in district finals. Then members of their squad start to disappear.ARe they being killed by the cook, the janitor, or Brent, the boyfriend of one of the cheerleaders.Cheerleader Camp stars the knock out Betsy Russell(Private School,Tomboy,Avenging Angel), and former teen idol Leif Garrett(Walking Tall II,Walking Tall-The Final Chapter). Not a great piece of work,but worth a view."
3,Bloody Pom-Poms and Scary Mascot Costumes,"This one is not bad. It's worth watching more than once.Honestly, more of a comedy than scary--but a weird twist ending that was interesting.The death scenes were bloodly for the most part. The plot is funny in spaces, character reaction not suitable for the scary situation.If you want a comedy with a few stabs once in awhile with boobage in your face, then this is for you...a serious horror movie, no way.Favorite scene: when the sheriff gets it! (I won't spoil it for you)."
4,Great piece of cheese,"Great cheesy 80's film. You've got to see this one to believe it. Leif Garrett in a horror film? Bring out the 'queso' dip! See this one JUST for the cheese factor - and if you're straight, get it for all the T&A...blah; blah blah.I think Amazon.com should do something against these gratuitious 1000+ word reviews. Eveyone thinks they're Roger Ebert these days. Sheesh."
3,Basically,"This is your stereotypical 80's slasher film. If Chopping Mall is your kind of movie, then this one is for you. With Leif Garrett, this movie actually has someone you will recognize. Typical low budget stuff with enough gore and boobs to keep you interested for most of the film. This follows the usual formula as teens in Cheerleading camp get bumped off one by one, with the big suprise reveal at the end. This one is just okay. If you are a huge fan of the 80's horror, then pick it up, if not, you should rent it first."
4,Different views of Texas history,"Came across this book while doing genealogical research;found it a nice break from modern day historian writing style. Genealogists and history buffs interested in Texas Rangers but also social history of the place and time may find its authentic voice refreshing. Years ago, I was told that C.L. Douglas was one of those authors that sometimes went to great lengths to experience whatever he was writing about. It's a quick read. Fans of Larry McMurty's excellent ""Lonesome Dove"" novel might enjoy this too."

1,Don't bother.,"This book is available for free and in a superior edition online. I have never found a book by this publisher that I couldn't locate in a free online edition. The one book I have purchased from them I returned as it consisted of seriously garbled OCR text. Buyer beware. Shame, Amazon."
2,Gohan could have done better,"This film is just too short and barely qualifies as a movie.The artwork and soundtrack for the fighting were quite good relative to other films, but there was just too little of it. Additionally, I was supremely disappointed in the plot of the film as it relates to Gohan's involvment.It is obvious from the film that Broly's ultra-super saiyan form is more powerful than Gohan as a super saiyan, which is as it should be. However, at this point in the Dragonball timeline, Gohan can ascend to super saiyan 2.Unfortunately, the writers of this film chose to ignore this ability, which, presumaby, could have led to the defeat of Broly. Clearly, this ability was ignored to rationalize the presence of Goku in the film - a very poor choice in my opinion.If you are like me and watch these films for the artwork, soundtrack, and transformations to higher levels of consciousness (and the associated drama), then I think you will feel a bit let down."
1,Is this a joke?,"Okay. Wow. My friend loaned my the first and second Broly movies. Obviously I watched the first one first, and then the second one. I thought the first one was piss poor. It takes everyone in the Dragonball galaxy to take him out, and Vegeta is a coward. And if he's so strong, why does nobody go to SSJ2? Or SSJ3? So I thought the second would be better. Boy was I wrong. In the first movie, Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Future Trunks, Gohan and Krillin couldn't defeat Broly. In the second one, Broly has trouble even putting a scratch on Chibi Trunks and Goten. This movie is what the DBZ staff and FUNimation do when they're bored. Do I dare watch Bio Broly?"
4,broly 2 is pretty good............,"I REALY LIKED THIS MOVIE BECUSE IT BRINGS GOTEN AND TRUNKS TOGETHER AND YOU GET TO SEE VIDEL, WHO DOSEN'T GET MUCH AIR TIME.ALTHOUGH THEY SREWED UP WITH THE TRANSLATION A LITTLE- SO MY ADVICE IS TO WATCH IT IN JAPENESS WITH SUBTITLES. ALSO, WHEN THEY SAY BREIF NUDITY THIER NOT KIDDING................. FIANALLY IT'S GREAT SEE GOHAN, GOTEN , AND GOKU ALL USE THE KAH-MEE-HA-MEE-HA AT ONCE."
2,Really disappointing...,"Even though this film ends with a decent fight scene, most of it is drawn out and pointless. Sure Trunks and Goten can be amusing, but this is too much. Not only that, Broly comes across as a real dufuss in this one - the endless repetition of his grunted one line gets really annoying and in itself merits the whooping that he gets in the end. Broly was a ruthless villian bent on destruction in his first appearance, but he just kind 'floats around' in this one not really doing much of anything. I'd like to say that there is hope, but Bio Broly is even worse..."
3,Something for Hardcore DBZ fans,"In all respects this film was not as good as the first Brolly film, nor many of the other films, like Lord Slug, History of Trunks, and Coolers Revenge. In fact it merely acts as a continuation of the DBZ world for the hard core fans, broader anime fans won't enjoy it as much. This is brought on by the meandering nature that comes across from the positioning of the central characters of Kid Trunks; Goten; and Videl, who are looking for the Dragon Balls. Theres alot of familiar humour that ardent DBZ fans will enjoy. And the climax is the usual, though the battle between Teen Gohan and Brolly is ok.A film for deep seatd Dragon Ball Z. I'd much more recommend Cooler's Revenge, probably because of the great rock and metal sound track with Disturbed and Drowning Pool."
3,"Great ending, Weak story.(too lazy to get account, so had to write on kids)","This movie was okay. the only problems that i had with it was that it was a little slow. When trunks and goten fight broly, he mainly is just floating around. The action in the show is what i expected. i haven't seen the first one yet but i am hoping that that has more action like the Omega Shenron fight in Dragonball GT. The ending was great because when gohan showed up, the action picked up but it wasn't what i expected. I would not suggest buying this movie, but you should see it at least."
4,Is it uncut?,It dozent say it if was uncut or notI want to switch to the Jap. audioSo is it Uncut... SEND US SOME INFO!!!WHOS WITH ME?!!!
4,Tenth DBZ Movie Pretty Good,"This is the tenth Dragon Ball Z movie of thirteen. In this one, Broly has barely survived his last encounter with Goku and is hiding deep in the mountains on Earth, recuperating. Now Broly has come back for some violence, and Goten, Trunks, and Gohan are the unfortunate ones who stumble accross him. This movie, like Bojack Unbound, dousn't have very much combat, mostly Broly just slapping Trunks but not trying to kill him. It gets more interesting when Gohan comes around, because then Broly remembers his face and he starts kicking @$$. It's pretty laid back, but it's still worth buying, at least on VHS. And yes, for those of you curious ones, this DVD is uncut, so it will have Japanese dialogue."
4,BROLY TIMES TWO!!!,"Good movie here. Broly returns for a second time and still is on a ""quest"" to destroy goku. I hated that he picked on trunks and goten most of the movie, but they put up a good fight. Very funny moment when trunks mooned broly and also peeed on him. My favorite dbz moment ever is also in this movie. A triple kamehameha on broly to send him to the sun and blow him up. I recommend this movie to your collection."
1,Poor quality,I purchased X3 (6 plants total) two years ago. I live in Central Florida (zone9) and planted them appropriately. My gardener tended them but of the surviving 2 one is still 12 inches and one is 3 feet. Not as described in product description and certainly not as product picture.
5,Rockabilly History!,"Great book detailing the highs and lows of Carl Perkins' life.From sharecropper's son to songwriter and appreciated from Elvis to the Beatles, Carl's travels through show biz is nicely detailed. This was written while Carl was still alive. I am fortunate to have this hardback, signed by Carl."
1,This tastes like bile!,"I'm not trying to offend anyone, but this soda is definitely an aquired taste! I just had my first bottle, as I was drawn in by the amazing packaging and love for anything Italian. Ugh! I swear I threw up in my mouth. Stay away from this if you cannot tolerate the smell or taste of vomit. Heard it tastes better with bitters in it, but I cannot stomach another sip."
4,Miss the stuff,"Used to get a bottle of it with burgers and fries. Loved the stuff. Nice slow sipping drink that may not appeal to all. Take you time while drinking this. Since I have moved out of NYC, I have not been able to find it in stores. Great that Amazon has it."
2,Not exactly healthy,"I read an article about ""healthier"" european sodas and after some research ended up buying a selection including Sanbitter. I was a bit shocked to to find that the ingredients included plenty of sugar and red food dye. Not my cup of tea. The taste was a bit chemical."
5,Got to be an Italian to drink this,"The name sanbitter (san pellegrino bitter) tells all. This is a typical italian ""aperitivo"". A drink that should be drink in small size before having dinner(with snacks like penuts, small crackers, etc.). The bitterness (and believe me is bitter) is suppose to stimulate your appetite. My wife that is born in the US hate it, as it Italian I love it...so I guess it requires to have roots in Italy. Rated 5 as Italian, someone in US will be probably rate this 1."
4,It's not bad if you know what to expect,"This is a decent aperitif soda with a taste reminiscent of grapefruit and lemon (somewhat similar to a strong IPA), with a small addition of sour cherry. It is an aperitif soda- drink it before a meal and it will help to 'wake-up' your tastes; I can also imagine it as a good digestif after a heavy meal. This will not be everyone's favorite drink but, then again, it was never meant to be consumed quickly or in a large quantity. Drink it with a meal and enjoy it as a part of that meal, not as a beverage on its own (unless you enjoy it).This would also make a good mid-afternoon soda replacement for us folks who might really want a sweet carbonated beverage without artificial sweeteners."
4,A new Mansfield book for me,I have been a fan of Elizabeth Mansfield for many years and I am really glad to see her books starting to show up electronically. This book is one I had not read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Another good one from a historical author in a class with Georgette Heyer.
2,Disappointing,"I've long been a fan of Elizabeth Mansfield. Her PHANTOM LOVER and REGENCY STING have resided on my ""keeper shelf"" for many years now. When I heard she had a new book out after far too long an absence, I was delighted. I really wanted to love this book. Unfortunately, MISCALCULATIONS is not one of her better efforts. The plot is thin and, worse, the hero seemed morally weak, jumping to the villain's tune like one of Pavlov's dogs. I will continue to buy and read Elizabeth Mansfield, but I hope she quickly returns to her earlier form."
3,Miscalculation,Elizabeth Mansfield has written many Regency romance novels. This one is slighter than usual with a plot line which is more predictable than usual and paper-thin characters. Ms. Mansfield's writing is smooth and readable.
2,"Nothing works here, despite the great musicians","This was one of the great disappointments in Mahler recordings, with Vickers shouting and bullying his way through the tenor part, Norman sounding fine but without great depth of interpretation, and Davis completely out of his element in a peerless masterpiece. A sad misfire all around."
4,"Enjoyable, but for Vickers in the Drinking Song","The first song of the piece is just too much for Vickers to handle--particularly at this stage of his career. It would have been nice to hear him sing it in the 1960's when he was at the top of his game.Jessye Norman's voice is beautiful in this recording. I would agree that the conducting and conception of this recording does not ring out all of the emotion that it could. She does not sing with the emotional commitment of Ferrier, but Ferrier does not have to exquisite beauty of voice. The other thing that I like about Jessye Norman's voice is that it is distinctive and immediately recognizable. Norman's Abschied is a beautiful serenade to the end of an evening. She is exquisite.Davis does not bring out all of the feeling that the work is capable of delivering. At times, (particularly in Der Abschied), it sounds dream-like. This is not to everyone's tastes, but Norman's performance is worth having for her alone."
1,Awful,This is the most unfortunate recording of this work i've everlistened. Worst of all Jon Vickers shouts that ruin everything.Don't buy it.
3,Decieving,"Jessye Norman was one of the most impressive interpreter of Das Lied von der Erde . It exists one video with the young Rattle and one very old Vickers , recorded at the proms , that make me one profound impression .The andamentos of Rattle are fast , and his conducting is full of life. In this recording the tempi of Colin Davis are too slow, without life . And Norman sings all the time less than the half she was capable at this time. A pity .I finally heard the recording that Norman did with Levine in Berlin.The difference is enormous.The tenor ( Jerusalem) is by far better and the conductor makes all the difference."
3,"An OK recording, but no goosebumps.","Jessye Norman is wonderful to listen to and she sings here, as wherever she does, with beauty and elegance. Jon Vickers is fine, but not really exceptional. Mahler claimed that this was his most personal work, yet I did not feel any of that in this recording as I did the first time I heard Mahler's symphonies. No emotional rushes, no adrenaline surges that I have become used to with Mahler. An OK recording, but it did not seem very inspired."
2,A vain attempt at popularizing dormitory misbehavior,"While conceptually I believe this book could have potential, it is hampered by the fact that it it lacking in quantity and quality of recommended games and the games that are suggested are obviously intended for the borderline alcoholic that chooses to engage in such endeavors not for fun but as a ritual leading to loss of stomach content."
5,A classic of western civilization,I'm at a loss to describe the beauty of this book. It just resonates with my sole.
5,"Got this to hang up my coat, works great!","Grabbed one of these for my office. I can hang a knee length heavy weight Pea coat with things in all the pockets quite easily.Also holds my leather duster without stress. Hasn't fallen yet, and at this point I don't think it ever ywell. Quite handy, thick hook to grab anything, and very strong."
3,Watch The Weight Limitation..,"These 3M Command Large Hooks attach to your wall or other surfaces using a double sided tape strip. They adhere pretty good and work sufficiently at holding light duty items like a bathrobe, a light jacket or such. According to the package you should wait for one hour before use. These hooks will support up to 5 Lb or 2 Kg but I wouldn't advise hanging anything heavier because it will end up on the floor, possibly shattering anything in it's path.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
2,Adhesive fails and hooks break under moderate load...,"I thought Command Adhesive hooks were a great idea. But after they fall off the wall a few times and the hooks that do stay up break, you go back to less expensive and more dependable methods."
2,Will fail after a few years.,"I had two of these fail on me after about two years. The sticker didn't fail. The problem was that the paint and plaster peel off after months of stress. So now my walls have these big 3 inch scrapes where the plaster peeled off. Much worse than having a nail hole. The smaller hooks though, are still holding up well. I wouldn't recommend hanging anything more than 3 pounds off of these for more than a year."
2,"Nice idea, but. . .","These might work well on tile, stainless steel or other solid smooth surface, but they are advertized to work well on regualar painted walls and this has NOT been my experience. I mounted several 1lb or less pictures with the hooks rated at 2lb, and after a few days, they came tumbling down. I hung one of the same pictures up with the large hook with the same result. I think they stick ok to the paint, as in each case the paint and some of the drywall paper came off with the hook. The problem is that small areas of the wall are just not made to handle that much stress (my theory), so after I repair my walls, I will be going back to traditional picture hanging methods. With this poor experience, I'm NOT going to test my theory with regards to other types of surfaces - it's not worth my time."
5,Excellent Hooks,We attached the hook to our bathroom door to hang our towels and it does the job. I was pleasantly surprised to see the weight it can handle - excellent product.
5,"Excellent Product, but...","I love these hooks and was excited to find them online since we can't get them overseas. My only complaint is that you can't have them shipped to an APO for some reason, even though it's a US post office box that is forwarded by the military after the fact. Otherwise they are great!"
1,A disaster!!,"I followed the instructions. The hook held for 6 days and then the artwork fell to the floor, damaging the frame and breaking the glass. Goodness knows how much it is going to cost me to have it repaired."
2,It did not work,This product is not for all types of walls. Be careful before buying. Did not work long in my case.
3,A good all-around album,"Chuck Loeb as a guitarist is phenominal. However I don't feel that he did his very best with ""Listen."" Chuck's other music is very red-hot [you'll like track #4], and ""Listen"" includes a few upbeat tempo tracks as well as some more 'sappy' tracks [like the title track] that most performers have to throw in there. Track #2, ""High Five"" will stick in your head all day. What I like about Chuck's music is that you can actually whistle the melodies. This album could use some more help in the percussion area, it sounds like most of the tracks are drummed on a percussion machine. He does get some help from Bob James on the title track, which is nice. All in all, if you want something to settle you down in traffic or pop in when visitors come over, this is a great album."
3,not chucks best but its safe!,"listen has some nice melodies and grooves but falls too much into the smooth jazz cd101.9 format. i know that we all have to pay our bills , but chuck is better than this, not up to par as magic fingers, life colars, or balance! i hope chuck doen't stay here long! with that it's still a much better cd than most in this gendre, chuck should check out billy eric they have a lot in common!"
1,A FAKE ###############,"WHAT A SHAME THIS IS A FAKE CD, IT IS A CD-R BE CAREFUL VERY EXPENSIVE TO BE MADE IN HOME"
3,Dicey durability,"I really liked the light at first. It looked durable and good for field action. It took a good spill and now the bulb or connection is half ass. It fades in and out of bright to dark randomly. I cleaned the connections, but to no avail. I can't trust it for field use. I didn't know there was a difference in grades between mil spec and retail. I bought Gerber because of their reputation. Back to Mag Light."
2,nah...,"I bought this flashlight at my local AAFES. Didnt put out the light i would expect. also the belt clip broke pretty quick, and i didnt really even use it. I stuck it in my camelbak for a backup. Only pro i got is the color switching is good for hassle free light discipline. spring for a surefire with multiple intensities."
4,Minidisc player,"This minidisc did the basics of recording and playback very well,considering it was so inexpensive. The added feature of an FM radiowas a pleasant surprise. Lotsa music for the buck and less expensive thenthe over-rated MP3,which is in the same ATRAC format."
5,sony mz-nf520d walkman,"i love this product. the radio is a plus to me, though at times i have seen am/fm in the sellers text - but there is no am that i ahve yet to figure out. have never heard anything on the tv or weather portion (could be the area i am in). yet, have ordered myself another one as a backup."
1,sonic stage is worthless,"ok guys lets make this simple DO NOT BUY ANY MINIDISC PLAYER the problem is this product promises to be able to transfer your music files to the minidisc and it cant it constantly hangs my machine (dell 8400 2GB ram ,3GHZ) i have reintalled my operating system XP then Vista in an attempt to get it to work it still doesnt so my brand new minidisc player is going into the bin.......sony is playing the fool they had a wonderfull product and hindered it with worthless software....if u want portable music buy an ipod instead you wont regret it."
5,I love mine,"My daughters gave me my Sony MZ-NF520D years ago for a Mother's Day gift. I use it all the time to speedwalk, jog, and clean house, the single AA lasts forever. The radio option is a great and making my own MD's is easy and quick. I love it. Get the waist band and the arm band for easier movement depending, also have plenty of extra MDs around. I use the cassette player attachment in our vehicles so that we always have plenty of music we love. I have the car accessory that allows the control on an easy-to-use control knob."
4,MD Player,"I am someone who has to have all of the new stuff, but I happen to like the idea being able to change out the music on a whim. I don't need a computer - as long as I've made several disks. It reminds me of making those millions of cassettes for my car in the 80's!!"
2,Great for about six months,"This item worked fine for about six months. Then, the remote started to work very strangely. The play button would change tracks. The stop button would sometimes change the volume and sometimes turn the bass on and off. The bass button did nothing. The rewind and fast-forward buttons selected random tracks, rather than going back one track or forward one track. To me, the remote is a very important part of this walkman, especially on the go. I don't want to dig into the belt where my player is and fool around with it every time I need to. And now, the remote doesn't work at all. The same problem happened with the previous player I had, which is the same product. But that one had a longer life span.Other than the remote, the player works fine. The sound is good, but I don't know about the radio, since I don't listen to the radio. But overall, if you rely on the remote, look for a different player."
2,Not an MP3 player,"This player DOES NOT PLAY MP3s/WMAs/etc. Do not be fooled by the labeling. It converts these formats into ATRAC, this becomes a problem when you try to transfer over protected file formats that you might download off of iTunes and such. It's better to say this is an ATRAC player."
1,"Sliced, diced and tasteless...","First, as other reviews have pointed out, this is the third published book, but the events happen between book one and book two. Also, it is based on the graphic novel, with many of the best parts removed. With only 209 pages a lot of stuff just did not make it into the novel - but the stuff they cut out was either very important or really cool. What we get as a result is somewhat bland, like pudding without any flavor. Good to fill in the time between GOOD books, but nothing to bother with. Start with Prey and end with Hunter's Planet. DON'T get this book, new, used, downloaded. Just don't."
5,AVP,"I loved this book and I wish there was a lot more.One of the things I would like to see is this being turned into a better film series, bringing out all the characters, returning and new.S.D Perry is such a great author and I hope she does more on this character, though I heard the second book isn't as great but still it sounds okay and willing to read it."
2,Continuity is seriously lacking,"For any of you who have read the trilogy you know what I am talking about. I was disappointed in A/P War because I was expecting it to take off from book 2 (Hunters Planet), which it did not, even in the least. It looks as if the author of Hunters Planet, David Bischoff, read the first book (Prey) and did his homework but Perry didn't follow and read HP. The continuity is strikingly lacking, right down to one character that was killed off in HP miraculously reappearing in War just to be killed off again. There are other examples like the non-mentioning of characters from HP, Noguchi's experiences in HP, and so forth but I think you get the idea. I found Hunters Planet to be full of action and was really expecting the story to carry on into War. I should have quit after Hunters Planet."
2,Well at least its better then the last one,"From all the other reviews I have seen I agree with Cody Menzies the most. The only two things that made me finish this book was the fact that it is a AvP novel and that it continues the Aliens: Berserker storline. However it is still a vast improvement to the last book, of which I feel should not even be in print any more. S.D. Perry is a great writer and should be able to do better then this. The first one was great so what I want to know is what went wrong? But as soon as you get by the errors in this story you will be in for a some what pleasing read. Just don't go thinking you are going to like it as much as Prey or Berserker."
4,Alien vs. Predator: War,"This book is for anyone who knows anything about Aliens or Predators or likes Mrs. Perry. It is a real treat to those of us who have read Aliens: Berserker. This book does start off kind of slow but begins to pick up pace later. Even with this factor you'll never want to put it down. It is a great addition to any sci-fi library. Plus it actually explains AvP: Hunter's Planet I think it was? Anyway...pick up this book if you're into S.D., Aliens, Predators, or just science fiction...it won't disappoint."
4,S.D. Perry rules!,"I really liked this book, actually stayed up till 5 in the morning to finish it. S.D. Perry is unquestionably the best author in the Aliens and Aliens vs. Predator series and this book doesn't fail to dissapoint. The characters are strong, the action is graphic, and the atmosphere is dark and disturbing, just the way an Aliens novel should be. If anything, my only complaint would be that it was too short. She could have developed the plot a lot more, but it's a small enough complaint. Another review mentioned the error that was made in the timeline. I noticed it too, but honestly didn't care. I thought ""Hunter's Planet"" was awful, worth forgetting about. For anyone who hasn't started this series yet, read Aliens vs. Predator: Prey first, skip Hunter's Planet and read Aliens: Berserker instead."
1,Let's forget this book ever happened.,"When AVP:War came out by SD Perry after 4 yrs when she wrote the first AvP: Prey novel, I was overjoyed that she came back to write another novel. Gee I was sorely disappointed. The book failed to follow the timeline of the series. The Predators were underated, the Marine main characters overated and overemphasized, and you hardly ever see Machiko (hardly had a role and her character was misdeveloped) in the book. Some of the Pred characters are back from the book Hunter's Planet by David Bishoff. But how can that be (Those who read Hunter's Planet would know what I mean). Aliens were harly in it either. Lack of consistency with the AvP novel timeline as well as lack of species development; as well as a lack of character dev. and epilogue in addition. I have been a AVP fan for a long time and well I was dismayed to say the least. Maybe she should go back and write Resident Evil novels, she wrote those well anyway."
3,Pretty quick read...,"I just bought this book saturday and I already breezed right through it. I really wish it was a little longer...almost every scene in the story seemed fast paced.Yes, there were some parts of the book that I liked; the character Machiko was pretty likeable, but that's about it.There weren't to many other characters in the story that you could get attached to.I also didn't like how the 'Predator' characters were written; almost as if they were ""chauvinistic"" men. But I guess it made sense(in a way), given that Machiko was both human and a woman; so you gotta add some conflict of discrimination.It's not a bad a book... if you're a 'die-hard' fanatic of AVP you're probably like it a lot. But if you're new to the franchise, I recommend you read the first book and pick up this copy later; that is, if you're interested in finding out what happens after 'Prey.'"
4,Third book in an action packed trilogy!,"After having read AVP: Prey, I followed reviewer Seth's advice from below and read Aliens Berserker and AVP War in sequence. I couldn't put either of them down! The descriptions of the MAX dealing destruction to A's and P's alike are really vivid, painting pictures in my mind...Perry rocks! I recommend the entire trilogy, but like others here, I wish there had been some Predatorial 'diversity of attitudes' in the 3rd book."
5,Unlocks The Mystery,"There is a lot of great information here. I could never figure out how to play melody over blues progressions, this book solved that riddle for me. The jams are great, you can jump around the book, it does'nt have to be followed in any order. Some of the chapters show you how to get the Santana sound, others show you swing blues, others are straight ahead major melody...It ends with some more advanced stuff that is clearly explained and you can actually play it! Also, the Theory Section in the beginning is as clear an explanation of chord theory for guitar players as I have seen.Everybody should buy this book... Five Stars!"
2,to basic for the advanced player,"Ok, this is fine if you don't know your theory very well. However if you do then no its to basic and predictable. If you fairly educated then do not buy this book. It's like many books out there. It takes basic ideas and drags them out to much. If you know your scales and modes then this book is a waste of time."
1,Perverse and a very passe.,"This took us through a world unrelated in the name of ""archetypes"". I thought it was more like ""crap"". It was also quite difficult to navigate to what you wanted to find. I had hoped this book would talk about the inner planets and their effects. It did so in only the most general ways and displayed a great knowledge of things no longer held to be true."
5,EXCELLENT READ!,If your interested in learning more about the nuances of the inner planets; then this is a wonderful investment! I enjoy the psychological interpretation of the archetypes of the planets.
5,AN EXCELLENT BOOK TO OWN,I checked this book out from my Public Library and while reading it I quickly decided that I wanted to own a copy for reading and re-reading. It is wonderfully organized so you can always refer back to a particular section easily. The bibliograpy is a gold mine for those interested in further pursuit of COMING TO OUR SENSES.
2,Much Too Much,"As another reviewer has noted, this book is about four books in one. As a person who is very aware of the wonderful books on meditation available today, of which Kabat-Zinn's Wherever You Go There You Are is one, I recommend that you not waste your time and energy on this one."
2,Comng to our Senses,Very long and takes to long to make its point. Has some good information though. I wouldn't recommend this book.
2,Disappointment,"I was excited to see a new book from Kabat-Zinn, but so far I have found many of the ""chapters"" seem to have a tiny scrap of an idea that has somehow been blown into several pages--much ado about nothing, I'm afraid. Actually, an incredible amount of much ado, given the length of the book. I plan to separate wheat from chaffe to get what I can from my purchase."
1,how awful is awful? read this book to find out,"actually, i couldn't read this book. i couldn't get through it. all i can say is this guy needs to stop over analizing meditation and do more of it. i know, i know - he has creditials but that didn't change the fact that i often found myself exhausted by the run - ons in this book. most sentences are a paragragh long. maybe jon just likes to hear himself talk and is facinated by his own mind's constant banter. if you want to read from an author who clearly has incorporated meditaion and mindfulness in their very being try thich nhat hanh."
3,Meditation instruction,I purchased this audio to listen while driving. I expected to be listening to Jon describe mindfulness practices but not to the detail that is included in the audio version. It is not a commuting Audio. Love him none the less.
4,Wow It Really Works!,I started paying attention to the physical reactions my body has to stressful situations and thoughts about a month ago. Now things that would have been devastating are pretty ok to down right amusing. This single insight from the book has made a world of difference.
3,In need of a good Editor,"There are pearls of wisdom, shrouded by much verbage. Some prefer the scenic route...I prefer the shortest and most direct. This book required alot of concentration to keep my mind from wandering....and every once in a while, a pearl of wisdom or insight surfaces to make it all worthwhile. This is the type of book that many will not finish inspite of its excellent content."
4,A wonderful read!,"I loved this book and the love story between Beatrice and Angelo, though there were a few things that bothered me. The story began with the two of them already well acquainted and really left you to wonder what had happened between them 5 years before. It also ended too soon, with the reader not knowing what would become of them. An epilogue would have been good. There were a lot of issues that were talked about in the book, but were never resolved. However, this is a good book and I found it hard to put down. It's not real light reading, but the romance is wonderful and you will love Angelo and his love for Beatrice."
5,Loved the history along with the Romance.,Loved it! The author was very knowledgeable about life during these war times and I felt that I learned all kinds of things as well as enjoyed a wonderfully awesome and heart pounding story. I was on the edge of my seat numerous times wondering what was happening. It never let my blood pressure stay at normal that was for sure.
1,Very poorly written,"This is probably the worst written book, I've read in years. The historical aspects are as thin as an onion peel.The character development is non-existent. The plot lines are totally ridiculous. I love Italy and thought it would be an amusing read on a recent airplane trip -- I should have taken a nap!"
2,Poorly Written,"I've read other stuff by Elaine Coffman that I've enjoyed, but this is not one of them. I'll admit here and now, I haven't read very much of it -- mostly because it's too painful to read. The writing is extremely stilted, unemotional, and unrealistic, almost like the author is writing a report rather than a romance. It made me wonder if this was a story written by Coffman in earlier days that she's recently decided to recycle. I hope so -- otherwise I'll think twice about buying future books from her. In my opinion this one wasn't worth the money I spent on it."
1,Doesn't fit right anywhere,You shouldn't have asked for a review. I hate it. I have returned it. It doesn't fit right anywhere. THe sides are too narrow. The cups aren't set in the right place. THe straps are too narrow. It's way too expensive for the garment.
4,The Food Taster,"""The Food Taster"" is the story of the frightening yet often humorous life of an Italian food taster. Ugo is a peasent who is taken from his home along with his daughter to go work for the Duke Frederico. Soon, not only is Ugo faced with the terror of his every bite, but the protection of his beautiful daughter Miranda. ""The Food Taster"" gives an entertaining and dark look at Italy during the middle ages, and the roles played by the nobility and peasents of the kingdom. The author combines humour and history to make an original and twisted story that will have you eating it up in seconds."
2,Disappointing.,"I didn't have high hopes for this book considering I found it marked down to $2.00, but it was still disappointing. The idea for the plot was somewhat entertaining, but the author's writing abilities were mediocre at best. Although there is a note at the end of the book proclaiming that it started as a writing class project, Elbling violated a vast majority of the rules studied in the most elementary creative writing classes."
2,"Same ol', same ol'","I saw only on scene of this movie with Angie and of some guy suffering from acne scarring. And I have to say Angie has a beautiful body, but her sex scenes are almost always the same.Angie on top, guy on bottom, her hair in the way of the merchendise. I dunno if it is worth buying, but if you happened to catch it on late night cable... take a gander."
2,Solid B movie -- flows like soft-core porn,"So I Netflixed this movie for two reasons:(a) It has Richard Grieco, and I wanted to see what he was up to lately(b) It seemed to have an interesting enough plotAbout ten minutes into the movie, it was easy to see it's caliber, let alone have the good sense to chase everyone 18 and younger out of the room. As indicated in the title, this movie plays like soft core pornography in many scenes (Eyes Wide Shut is tame next to this one) and the actors in their limited depth give solid B movie performances. Richard Grieco is the closest to quality acting this film has, and he basically grunts and smolders his way through each scene, bad boy that he's trying to be.I gave it two stars because the ending actually kept me guessing and caught me by surprise, and up until that point I'd had it pinned as pretty formulaic. Other than that, it's pretty much a wash."
4,Sexual Predator,All in all not a bad movie. If you like Angie Everhart you should like this movie.That about all i can say about this movie????
2,"Angie's hot, but not worth buying","This is a barebones DVD, 90 minutes long, that reminds me of other erotic thrillers like Basic Instinct (with Sharon Stone) or Body of Evidence (with Madonna). Here, we get to see Angie Everhart act as a sex freak, and she has two really nice love scenes where she bares all, each scene lasting about a minute each.Richard Grieco does an OK job, but at certain points, he does seem like he's sleepwalking through this role. It's amazing how badly his TV/movie career has stumbled to be starring in direct-to-video movies like this one.This DVD is indeed barebones, not even a theatrical trailer or cast filmography. Just audio, subtitles, and chapter selection.This DVD's worth a rental just to see Angie in the buff, as well as a few other women, but otherwise, it's not worth buying."
4,Absolutely nice,"Here in EUrope is already out, since 5 days. Is a nice moovie compared to the rest of the moies where she played. I have lot from them, where she's a star, but in this one (even if she's finally naked...) she is great. The characters she play is OK, the rest of the cast is OK. There are sex scenes absolutely nice, and she look excellent.... Hope for her is the first step for a series of decent movies now."
2,"Lousy acting, but Grieco's a real hunk!","The plot has definate potential, but the movie was unfortunately ruined by poor acting from both stars, neither of whom seemed capable of reading their lines with any emotion at all. The ninety minutes I spent watching this film was saved from being a total waste only by the sight of Richard Grieco, however -- his acting talents might be minimal, but his sex appeal kept me glued to the screen. And male viewers will be equally appreciative of Angie Everhart's nude scenes. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie."
5,"Great, georgeous!",This book is really great! The words is very simple but has deeper meaning. If you want to have a victorious life then you should get this book!
1,bad theology,Name it and claim theology is disgusting.The prosperity gospel is just a lie.This is another heresy for money.Do not contribute to anotherGucci suit. Do not waste your time.
4,Encouraging & Inspirational,"I felt that this book was very encouraging and inspirational for someone that has lost faith, is in despair for whatever reason or feel that their blessings are blocked. The book overflows with numerous stories of people that the pastor/author is acquainted with, gives their individual stories of how faith was restored, prayers answered (in God's time, not their time), healing and forgiveness. I must admit that I felt the book could have been shorter in length and still made the same points as intended. The end of the book is outlined with a quick reference to all bible scriptures used.Would I recommend this book? YES. Was it a worthy purchase? YES."
1,Borderline,"While it is cheerfully pleasant and almost inspiring,this book is not completly biblical and a very sensational. Its caught somewhere between God's truth and compromise for the world's sake. It might come in handy if you need an emotional pick me up."
5,Wonderful Book,"This is an amazing book written by a true man of God. This book isn't a very technical Bible livign book that has very in depth hard to understand concenpts, but rather it is a literary work that you can relate to your everyday life. Throughout this book Joel uses many stories and situations from his life and the lives of people he has known to demonstrate his principles for living your best life now. I have had the pleasure of seeing Joel Osteen live at the Boston Garden and hope to be able to travel to Texas one day and see him at Lakewood. I recommend this book to all Christians. Your life will truly be changed if you learn to implement his 7 steps into your life. I was blessed by this book and I hope you will be too."
1,"How to get rich (if only you believe hard enough), by the prosperity gospel's poster boy","If it were only that easy...Taking Bible verses out of context, and using them to further self-centered wants, instead of serving others.I, personally, have had faith since becoming a Christian 14 years ago...I wonder where my mansion is? It should have arrived by now...Maybe the author should consider this...""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.""-1 John 2:15"
5,Life changing,This book was life changing for me. I have given it to friends and family and to me it was a little seed of the wonders heavenly father has written in his word for us.Even for my non christian friends it helps you deal with lifes trials. if we are christians or not we face them so why not face them with hope and a positive attitude:) It still is our choice we can choose to be miserable about it or choose to believe for the best like pastor Osteen has mentioned in this book. I would reccommend this to anyone.
1,What's happened to us?,"Enough has been said in all the other posts about the perceived good and bad in Osteen's book. To me, the most compelling indictment against the book comes from a post by a reader who found it refreshing for this reason: it didn't push scripture on the reader the way another Christian author did.Is that supposed to be considered a plus?Mr. Osteen should take heed of this backward compliment and understand that his book is drawing people to this life and not to the next; to self and not to Christ.What are we to make of this from the book of Hebrews: ""...you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one."" This great encouragement to materially bereft Christians appears antithetical to the premise of Mr. Osteen's book."
1,Save your funny money and your valuable time,"People say, ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". However, just reading the title is enough to make anyone with a shred of common sense think that it promotes the self above Almighty God. A Puritan named John Owen said it best on the title book of his first book A Display of Arminianism -- Self-exaltation Fights Against God (when you translate it from Greek to English). A title like the one on Mr. Osteen's book says nothing about humility. I admit that I have not read the book, but I also am letting it be known that it is not worth wasting your finite time here on Earth reading it when it's evident that Mr. Osteen is, at best, an Arminian heretic mixed with postive-confessionism. Even Rick Warren is better than Mr. Osteen -- and Warren's exegesis leaves much to be desired!!!"
3,There are better motivational books,Sometimes I am weary after reading a book that is suppose to enlighten me and provide me with insight into a new direction for my life. This is one of those books. I read before this book A Brush with Darkness by Lisa Fittipaldi which is NOT meant to be an inspirational/self help/self direction book and found it to be 1000 times more helpful and had an added bonus of being a delightful story. So I will continue to read these guru books and hope to find another that pleases me more.
1,another phony preacher,"joel is only good at motivating people like coaches do at at football game but clearly his teaching is unbiblical a pseudo-christian decieving many because they don't test his teaching with scriptures buy books from john macarthur,john piper,j vernon mcgee instead and you learn true teaching of the word of GOD"
4,Self help wisdom that is backed by the Bible,What makes for a good book?To me it is how the book leaves you feeling.I have been reading roughly a chapter a day of this book.I am not a Christian but still the results have been very striking. I feel a sense of calm and peace inside me. A sensation that has been alien to me of late.Part 4 of the book in which he talks about letting go of the past as a way to heal emotional wounds could have been written just for me.In fact I started reading this section immediately after experiencing a setback. Thanks to his advice I avoided the typical emotional meltdown and instead took the incident completely in stride.Joel Osteen is an inspiring and loving source of wisdom and I am truly grateful that he chose to share his teachings in a book.
1,"Read Your Bible, And Then Think.","Matthew 7:15 ""Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.Love Jesus,"
1,7 Points?,"Seven steps to living at our best potential. What kind of pop-psycological, psuedo bull crap is this? The Gospel accounts are in no way written as quick, easy, managable principles.Christ followers in America, wake up! Can't you all see that Osteen and many other TV evangelists reduce the Gospel to nothing?FALSE PROPHET."
4,"READ THIS BOOK, CHANGE YOUR LIFE","I first saw Joel Osteen on BET giving his sermon and i paid it no attention. Then i really started to listen to his words and their meaning and i was blown away. So i had to get his book and wow, it really opened my mind and my heart. Read this book was an enlightening experience and if you need a little guidance, if you're a little lost then you should do two things One: You should get this book and Two: you should click ""Yes"" this review was helpful. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
1,HIJACKING JESUS FOR THE CON,"Mr Osteen is simply using Christianity as a front for the purpose of recruiting into his motivational cult. His ""church"" is not a Christian church, it is a motivational cult. Mostly a benign cult, unless those being sheered are already poor. Rich people that give him money are either gullible saps or really believe ""God"" will favor them for giving their money to the cult, which is just dispicable; using Jesus of the Bible as some twisted personal money making devise. Like Osteen they are trading on the name of Jesus Christ for personal profit. Osteen is just another in the ancient line up of con men using the Christian religion and its Bible to bilk the disenfranched, depressed, and misguided."
5,Great,"This book was tagged with a reasonable price and it shipped fast I ordered it for a friend who had borrowed this book from another friend and misplaced it , it was a great replacement book..."
2,A Positive Book that is Weak on the Gospel,"Joel Osteen has the best of intentions. I believe he is trying to break the cloud of bondage, heaviness, and depression that hangs over many people today. But his positive, encouraging spirit seems to be borrowed from an author of another era--Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. Peale wrote about positive thinking in the 1950s and influenced many people (including Dr. Robert Schuller's ""possibility thinking""). Like Peale and Schuller, Osteen never fully explains the reason Christ died on the cross for our sins--that we are law-breakers under the wrath of God unless we repent and have faith in Jesus Christ.Osteen's book will lift your spirits and give you a big pat on the back (as well as a hug and a kiss), but he misses the mark on that which is the most important."
2,Whats in it for me Christianity,"What he teaches is a ""what can God do for me?"" Christianity, when in fact the opposite should be our attitude: What can I do for You Lord? God didn't put us on this earth to see what kind of a wonderful life we could make for ourselves, but simply to serve Him. I gave it 2 stars because the chapter on giving is wonderful."
5,"An inspiring book, filled with love and hope","Joel Osteen's book is a remarkable message of light and hope. Many people live discouraged, without faith. Even without love. Joel shows God is loving, forgiving, and forever-patient. He shows God restores life, and gives in abundance, once a person's heart is committed to Jesus. One only has to believe for a bright future, and God will provide. Moreover, Joel quotes the Bible, saying every single person is ""a man of valor, of great honor."" That is the intrinsic value of every man and woman. This value, Joel says, is put into us by God. Through Jesus, we can tap into God's strength and forgiveness, and boldly live a life filled with victory and abundance.I strongly recommend this book to any person who is looking for a way to lead a fulfilling life, filled with love, strength, and hope."
1,Another Man Centered Book,"Being a Christian is about worshiping God and not ourselves. This is another man centered, self help book. There is not that much Christian in the book except for using Christian vocabulary. The Gospel is Great news, but Olsteen preaches a false half Gospel. Jesus commands us to repent from our sins. He doesn't suggest or even ask, He commands. Joel Osteen said himself that he does not use the word sin, there for he is not preaching the Gospel of the Bible. He is preaching a wealth, health and prosperity gospel that is not in the Bible. This book is damaging, and Christians need to learn how to discern. Some reviewer states that Osteen makes alter calls, but how can you make an alter call if you haven't even presented the real gospel. Instead you get false converts that want Jesus to be their magic jeanie. Do not read this book."
5,This book is like a second Bible for me,"It's a very positive book, I wouldn't catalog as a religious book, but as a spiritual one. It raises your faith and it's full of methaphysical, spiritual principles. It's one of the best books I've read."
4,Amen!,"Many thanks to Reagle Beagle's review in 4/05. Just reading some of the negative reviews has truly opened my eyes to some so-called Christians. We are taught as true Christians not to judge others (including Joel Osteen) and show love for God and caring for all people. Joel gets that message across. If there are non-believers brought to Jesus Christ by watching Joel's message and/or reading this book, then 'AMEN' and 'Thanks Be To God'!!! I am taking the good advice of those who truly know love and compassion for God and others and getting this book."
2,missed the power,"Joel has millions of fans and ghost writers must be busy, these books lack the POWER of JESUS and his NAME and authority given to every believer. weak,,,watered down,,,,fluff,, For DEMON and ANGELS read Hagins books oin VISIONS, HEALING and DEMONS,,the books not booklets for a penny...u will be blessed"
5,great,My Husband loves Joel Osteen and so I got it for he for a Christmas Gift.I also love this product
1,Dangerous.,"Jesus Christ did not sacrifice himself on the cross so we can be blessed with material things, and be 'happy'. He did it so that we can repent of our sin, and receive God's gift of salvation and eternal life. Our sanctification includes necessary tough times, including times of personal great loss and sadness. These are used by God to grow us in holiness so that we might achieve God's plan for us. Taking scripture out of context to 'prove' a point is dangerous, deceptive and destructive. It was used by Satan at Jesus' temptation. Avoid this book, and all others not grounded in truth."
1,Misdirected Message,The euphoria filled religion-through-television crowd will rally enthusiastically around this self-promoter. Frenzied fundamentalists love this stuff. This is easy to buy into if you believe that Jesus' message centers around making yourself comfortable as opposed to directing comfort to those who live hard lives.
4,positive and inspirational book,"Joel talks important things in his latest book. There are lot of good things about positive thinking, trust, compassion, faith etc. Also people who are not so religious can read the book because it is very inspirational and gives good examples from ordinary life. It helps to raise the life to the next level. I warmly recommend the book."
5,Lakewood live is better,"Don't get me wrong, I love this book and Joel knows how to bring a message across, but listening to him read a book is nothing like listening to him speak live from Lakewood! However, this book has merit all of its own. Joel speaks of giving and part of giving brings you, the giver, abundance. He tells us that if we take care of others, then God will take care of us and in the same amount. So, if we want good things, we must do good things. So many think and believe that Joel just wants to make us believe that we can have anything and although that's true, he means it through faith and good deeds and if you're not sure of his message, this book is for you. I enjoyed it and it has helped me through my times of need and I must admit, I have had many times of need.I am the author of:One Boy's Struggle: A Memoir: Surviving Life with Undiagnosed ADDBryan"
5,Inspirational Message,"When you find life's troubles to be overwhelming, you can use all the help you can get. I have read several good Christian books this year, but Joel Osteen's book has had the most positive impact on my soul. I found renewed strength and sense of purpose fill my soul with every chapter. Also, I bought copies of this book for each of my two sons. This book helps explain the choices we can make to align ourselves with God's purpose, and find real happiness within ourselves. It really is that good. Glory to God."
1,Selling Religion,"Perhaps simply misguided? I don't know. But you should by pass this book and pick up the bible instead. This book is just a feel good book by a slick salesman. If you have a very good understanding of the bible and a strong faith then you could read this book for what it is. If not you would be missing the most important part of Christianity, the whole truth."
2,Mr. Teeth,"How does my review of the book by Mr. Teeth keep getting deleted? Could it be that my review is just as much fluff as this book? Or is it a conspiracy? Is Joel Osteen having an affair with Mr. Amazon so when somebody writes a bad review Mr. Amazon deletes it? Es Possible!Here is my problem this book is fluff. It says be rich, be happy, who cares about the poor? As long as you are happy you will get to heaven. See any parallels to Jesus's message? Neither do I. It is the new corporatization and watering down of Christianity in America. Coming next, taking your Sunday service in pill form while you shop for a new Hummer."
2,Very Disappointed!!,"I'm very disappointed in this book.. I watch Joel on TV Sunday morning..I was very happy when I first heard about his book.I bought it the first day out in the stores..However when I started reading it,,its all about his sermons..I'm very happy that he's doing so well..but..it thought his book would have been more informative..something different..actually in the first few pages he sounds like he bragging on how much God gives him..I pray with all my heart..so why am I still struggling?I know God loves US ALL..but.. it think if your intelligent you can make your life work..if your slower its harder.."
2,Grace With An Asterisk*,"So in this book, Osteen tells me God loves me and wants to prosper me beyond what I could think or imagine. He says I am the apple of God's eye. He says that God looks at ""my two good moves"" instead of the many times I mess up. He says that God loves me like a father and holds nothing against me. He says I should look forward to the future and forget the past.BUT* (Here's the fine print), If I am one of the millions not able to hear the message of Jesus Christ, or if I am a Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, B'ahai, or whatever, I am toast for eternity. Forever tortured by the God who wants me to live my best life now. (Go to joelosteen.com and click on 'What We Believe' and see for yourself.)The trouble is, that as much as Osteen wants me to think of a 'bigger God', I can think of a bigger one than what he's writing and preaching about."
2,Your Best Life Now,"The book was much smaller than the store version and seemed like a re-make homemade, flimsy, soft copy of the real version. I went and bought the original hard back in the book store. Still waiting to read it though. If it's half as good as Victoria's book, Love Life Now; I'm sure I have a lot to look forward to."
5,your best life now cd.,Item came in on time and in excellent condition. I would use this person again.
3,Your best life Now Audio,I would rather read the book. The tone of the audio is not what I expected but it is o.k. if you don't have time to read.
1,"christless, crossless, selfish tripe","Joel does not know the gospel, he does not know Christ, but he does know how to stroke your ego.This fairytale finds the average christian putting God on a leash in order to use his limitless power to satisfy every earthly whim.Osteen's thinking is a sad cross between SNL's Stewart Smalley and Dr. Phil. He uses bible verses out of context to show you that God has locked tremendous power within you and it is up to you to use your ""happy thoughts"" in order to release it.What about the fact that we are worthless sinners who need to cling to the cross of christ for our only salvation?Our best life now and forever comes from the total sacrifice for our sins that Christ made for us on the cross. I agree with the other reviewers. This is selfish, manipulative and shamefully greedy. No wonder this is so popular.God does notice what we do, and becuase of Christ he does not hold it against us.This book is very positive. Positively dangerous to the true gospel."
1,The WORST,"MISHANDLING GOD'S WORD.Reckless drivel.Inaccurate Biblical interpretation is deadly, ETERNALLY.Try Dr. John Macarthur and John Piper for life changing, inspirational and God honoring Biblical TRUTHS."
1,Modern Heretic?,It seems that the Church is always quick to label certain people as heretical. This guy actually fits the bill quite nicely.
5,I liked it...BUT not for the new Christian,"This is a book I like a lot. It gave me a lot of inspiration and there's a lot of joy that Joel wrote this with, which is a good thing. After all, ""The joy of the Lord is our strength"" (Neh. 8:10)However, I feel that this book needs to come with a cautionary warning. Because the book is written in such a simple and easy style, it can be easy to think that Joel might mean that God revolves around our world instead of the truth...which is that we revolve around God...that obedience is more important than blessing.For that reason, I think this book is less valuable for the beginning Christian who needs to learn the basics of faith and perhaps may give them the wrong idea of what to expect from God...but instead I would wholeheartedly share this book with a mature Christian who may be a little jaded in their walk and need that special pick me up."
5,The message is one dimentional but worth the read.,"Joel Osteen is a little one dimentional with the message he's trying to get across, but he's really, really good at getting that message across. He can't carry an entire religion on his back, but he can certainly help you see that you're valuable to God. He doesn't talk about condemnation or sin or any of the heavey stuff. He focusses mainly on the love God has for us, the value of each of us to God and the Joy that is available to each of us. It's a great message for anyone who's heard a thousand times that they're a sinner and can't earn God's love. That gets too depressing and defeating after a few decades. I appreciate Joel Osteen's message because I feel that so many priests and preachers are all to eager to point out our shortcomings while neglecting to point out our worth to the God who created us. For me, this was a timely reading. I needed to be reminded that God thinks I was worth creating."
3,Basic Word of Faith,"This book is a good summary of Word of Faith teaching It does not really cover new ground, but those unfamiliar with this kind of teaching might find it helpful.I do have an issue with his handling of grief. Some people can not get over things like the death of a loved one as easily as he suggests. He does not use the phrase, but his attitude is like those who say ""Suck it up.""I did find his account of his relationship with his father touching especially his father's last day on earth.He does seem enthusiastic about his message. Some of us going through testing may have trouble being a cheerful as he is though."
3,"When in doubt, read Scripture first","From reading other reviews of this book, I can tell that this book is read by Christians and non-Christians alike. I think this is a decent book, but sometimes ""Christian"" books scare me when non-Christians read them. While there are many good points to this book, there are still other points that can be deceiving to a non-Christian who is not familiar with Scripture, and then in turn gets the wrong idea about Christianity.When I read sentences from this book like, ""God wants this to be the best time of your life,"" that is not 100% true. Yes, God wants you to be happy and lead a good life here on Earth, but the Bible says in many places that the Earth is not our home. Our true citizenship is in Heaven. When Joel Osteen says ""God wants THIS..."" he is referring to our time on earth. But in truth, the best time of our life is going to be in Heaven.It's a good book, but when in doubt, go to God's Word for the answer."
4,Feel good and know that you are a child of God,"I think this is an excellent book with a foot in self-help/inspiration and one in biblically supported reference to God's plan for your life. I really enjoyed reading it on the train to work and back home. It is a perfect way to set your mind in a loving, supportive, Godly persepctive prior to beginning a hectic work day and is a nice way to de-pressurize before heading home to loved ones. It is light, supportive, enjoyable, often entertaining, endearing and very easy read. Also, you have to take it for what it offers and glean it's value as it relates to you, your life and your spiritual path. It is a Max Lucado meets Norman Vincent Peale meets Dr. Phil meets Bible oriented book. Definately one I will read again and again."
1,not very christian,"i just read the first chapter and i was astonished. as christians shouldn't we be content with what we have and crave more spiritual elightenment, not a new house. i think he is more of a life coach and some of what he says is good, but don't call it christianity..."
4,Many Missed the Point,"I think many people missed the point Joel Osteen is making. Your Best Life Now is about living everyday with joy. If you live life thinking only of Heaven and nothing else, then you've missed the joy of living life. Sure, a personal relationship with Christ is required. Still, God didn't say, ""Sit around solemnly and think of how unworthy of joy you should be."" No, Christ said, ""Though you live in this world, do not be like others, be better."" Let's remove our defeatist attitudes and imagine happiness. Beth Moore also makes this point in Breaking Free."
1,Not a fan...,"Our Women's Study group selected this book (why not? it's a Bestseller after all) to read weekly to help us grow as Christian women. Not the best choice. Collectively, we got through Ch. 2 (I read on through Ch. 9) and learned that when Joel Osteen gets on a plane in coach, he prays and God moves him up to first class.All of the first portion of the book was dedicated to financial success and how God wants you to be wealthy. It was completely under the ""ask and you shall receive"" mentality; which is tricky because some people are dealing with truly unfair life situations and, by this mentality, they should have just asked God for things to go better.We scrapped the book very quickly. Luckily, I borrowed mine from the church library, or else I'd be asking Mr. Osteen for my financial deposit of $20 back."
1,THE WAY OF THE CROSS LEADS HOME.,"The gospel is given to us so that we may submit our lives to God and follow his will. This book is too much about positive thinking and not enough about Christ who saves sinners. It sends the wrong message to a world that is hurting because of sin and unbelief. God's hope is to save souls and to give his life to us. ""Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."" Matthew 5:3 The gospel does give us a more abundant life and a new life but it is for God's glory not ours."
5,"Uplifting, Inspiring, Motivational reading","This book will maintain and keep the inspiration to moving forward in times of challenge and conflict. It helped me to stay on focus when my challenges appeared and discouragement could have settled in. Joel's demonstration of his love and trust in God was impacting on me and my perspective changed each time I read a new chapter. When negative thoughts attempted to enter, with sleep disturbance including anxiety, or any other obstacle I was able to use Joel's positive influence with God's love and settle back into a peaceful state."
2,Same ol' same ol',"This book is the same ol' same o' that his other books were. He just rearranges the order of the stories. If you have read 2 chapters of any book Joel has put out, I believe you have read all he has to say."
5,Joel Osteen,"I've heard the sermons from this guy and it's unbelievable. He's a major breath of fresh air. He's definitely one of a kind -- could be a young Billy Graham, but just better. The minute he starts to speak, I stop whatever I'm doing and I sit and I listen. His words always makes me feel like I'm under God's protection and love every day. I'm in the process of looking for his cds too...don't miss out!"
5,Life changing!,"Definitely a reading that nurtures the spirit. I've recommended it to lots of friends and family, I believe this is a must read book to anyone really interested in living his/her life to its full potential. I do believe Joel to be a very optimistic and enthusiastic person, his life is a reflection of his faith and he definitely shows us how faith can really move mountains!"
1,Shady doctrine aside...,"Okay, the church, by and large, once had:Aquinas, Spurgeon, Kirkegaard, Chesterton, Bunyan, Edwards, Lewis, et al...Now, we have people like this clown and his flagship publication touted as the best Christendom can come up with these days?I hope no one will wonder why the rest of the world doesn't take the church seriously."
3,Not as bad as people say,"This book is not as bad as people say it is. Yes, it's religious and deals with God, but I think even for non-religious people, it is still a very inspirational book and will boost your self-esteem and self-confidence a bit on a rainy day. One caveat I have though is that it's too long. Three hundrend and twenty pages of inspiration? C'mon. Most of the stuff he says are repetitious and in the form of long story format. This is not a big problem as you can quickly skim over it. Sometimes everyone needs just a little boost and this book will deliver that. However, I would not buy it because there are much better inspirational/self-help books out there."
1,This Book Should Come With a Warning Label,"So...I had to finally pick this book up. After peripherally hearing all kinds of things about Joel Osteen, I needed to read it for myself.Bottom line - this is trash. It is a 'how to' on worshiping gifts over the Giver; it's textbook idolatry. It's all about changing your attitude and mind to focus on 'good things' instead of doing what we were created to do - glorify God and enjoy HIM forever, regardless of circumstances.This is the 'any other Gospel' Paul talks about in Galatians. If you are a seeking 'spiritual' person, this is NOT the Christian message. If you want Christianity, try desiringgod.org."
2,fairly good...,hardly sensational. i've read 100s of christian outlines. this isn't the masterpiece people r saying. very clever and with good intentions though. buy used.
3,Fairly good motivational book,This is a fairly good motivational book. I used to watch Joel Osteen on TV. The show inspired me to buy this book. Of course the show is far more captivating than the book. But I would recommend this book for a good read.
1,A truly damaging message,"Christ came to promise us a more abundant life... and then taught us than the abundant life was the Kingdoom of Heaven. Not the Kingdom of Earth. If you must have wealth to be happy, or worse, to prove to yourself that God loves you, you completely misunderstand what Christ is about."
2,God does things for you,"God will do this for you. God will do that for you. Joel will have you thinking you can just kick back in the ez chair and watch while God gives you the preferential treatement in every area of your life.I couldn't finish the book because I just can't respect misguilded humility where one gives God credit for doing everything, and no credit to themselves. I do everything myself and sent God packing a few years ago, and I continue to be literally flooded with success after success.You'd be better off finding a book to teach you how to live your best life, but you're in control of the reigns. I see no need to involve a third-party metaphysical God into the picture which is completely unnecessary per my own life personal experience."
5,Best book ever,If you are having problems in your life that just do not ever seem to go away and you do not know why; you might want to read this book to gain a better understanding of why that is and learn a better way of getting what you want in life.
1,Blab it & grab it FLUFF...,"More of the same Charismaniac crap that says God is a slot machine . Say the right prayer and give enough of your money away and one day three cherries will come up and your ship will come in. Haven't we learned from the likes of Kenneth Copeland, Fred Price or Benny the ""Healer""Hinn that the only one getting rich off of these books,tapes,DVDs etc.. is these clowns who are selling them. I pray that Conservative America wakes up to this mega scam called "" Word Faith"". It should be called WORD FAKE. By the way I am a Christian , just not a gullible one."
5,Awesome and Inspirational,"I was so impressed with this book, I even began to watch Joel Osteen's televised church service on TV every Sunday. Also, helped me really think about the improvements I could make in my life. Thank You Joel Osteen!"
5,excellent,I use this as answer book whenever I am having a problem.. I have given as a gift over and over cause I want to share..............
2,Handle with care,"Not to disparage or discourage those who find help in Osteen, take the promises of material gain with a grain of salt, and keep the rest which encourages you.I mean, unless of course Jesus and his disciples completely missed the boat on that earthly riches stuff and had to wait for 2,000 years for these truths to be rediscovered. No, the Bible is constantly telling us to look to heavenly rewards and a heavenly citizenship, not earthly. Work hard, make the most of your abilities, and in doing so glorify God, but set your sights higher than earthly ambition. When we depart this life, it's not what we gathered and collected that will be remembered by others, but what we gave, even if it's a widows's mite.All believers are called to be discerning; no preacher can be expected to be 100% right all the time. Same with Joel. Take the good and complain about the error, as in all things."
3,All about Joel,"I really like this guy but this book was nothing more than stories about him and his father. After reading it I asked myself, ""Okay, now what were those steps?"""
3,Short Review YBLN,"Joel Osteen's YBLN seemed to me basic information that in some way challenged me to live life fuller, and I feel I am.I will sum up my review by quoating two of his citations:Henry Ford: ""Whether you believe you can do a thing or not,you are right.""Jesus Christ: ""If you believe, all things are possible."""
1,WoF Wealth and Health Gospel,"If you have watched Joel on TV, you'll now all what's written in this book. In fact, it's a summery of all his sermons. Nothing new inside.It's a ""self-aid"" guide to make you feel better. But be aware, it's not psychology, but WoF (Word of Faith, Wealth and Health Gospel).I personally prefer solid bible based teaching. This one is surely not."
1,Money Money Money Money-that's what's really important!,"Make the world a better place and donate money to charity instead of another money hungry Christian evangelist.Individuals such as this huckster, Jim and Tammy Faye, Jimmy Swaggert, Benny Hinn are nothing but charismatic conmen obsessed with material wealth, power, and nothing else.These are cynical criminals using religion to manipulate the masses for their own continued enrichment."
1,Trash,Great as a textbook on shameless greed and mindless American materialism; frightfully miserable as a faith resource. Bears precisely no resemblance to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Contains about as much gospel as the Dow Jones page in your newspaper.
1,God is not for sale!,"Someone recommended me this in CD telling me someone from that church gave her the CD as a gift. Being a christian myself and recognizing him from TV ads, I took the recommendation and actually started to listen the 1st CD (come in 5or 6 CD's ,can't remember for sure...). Anyways, I just had to stop after 10 minutes into it. It was advertising God. God is not for sale, Yes1 all crhistians are blessed. But the blessing is from heaven notfrom earthly good. All this book (or CD) is about is ""If you believe GOD you will be rich (with earlthly goods)"". What kind of message is that?! To tell the truth, it was waste of my precious 10 min. and I hope everyone who's thinking about buying this book to think very hard ifthis book is even worth reading it. It was THE worst christian book ever."
2,Good but not complete without journal/guide,The book is fine for the time you read it. But you need to purchase the 'journal' or 'study guide' to practice what he preaches.The book itself is pretty redundant but it keeps you motivated. The journal and/or study guide gives you the day-to-day things to do.It would have been better if he added the journal or study guide to this book. Or recommend having it to apply his steps.
1,Name it and claim it blasphemy,"I was so disappointed after reading this book. I have enjoyed watching Joel Osteen preach on the television for years and was excited to stumble across his book. I bought it without even looking with great detail at what it said. After bringing it home and reading, I discovered that all he is puting forth is ""name it and claim it"" blasphemy.I agree that it is important to have a positive attitude as we go through life, but God does NOT promise his children that he will give them whatever they want. IF it is God's will to provide riches or great wealth to His people, then He will make it so. However, He does not promise that He will give us whatever we ask for, just because we want it.God uses the poor and the sufferers og this world for His glory, just as He can the rich. As a child of God you must understand that His promise states that we will have riches in heaven for our service. There is no guarantee that you will receive all that you want here on this earth."
3,It's a repeat of Book 1,I love Joel Olsteen and watch him on television all the time. I believe in him and his positive messages but this book is more of the same repetitive stories in book 1. If you read the first book you do not need to buy the second book.
4,Abundance Can Be Yours,"Evangelist Joel Osteen in his first book, Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential connects living a Christian centered life with turning your potential into actual and blessed performance. He asserts God wants you to live to you full potential and not to do so is an insult to God.Outside of the spiritual references, Osteen makes a very solid case for living your full potential. His 7 steps are:1. Enlarge your vision2. Develop a healthy self image3. Discover the power of your thoughts and words4. Let go of the past5. Find strength through adversity6. Live to give7. Choose to be happyRegardless of whether you are a Christian or not or even if you believe his message is bad theology, Osteen provides some fresh insight as to how to turn innate potential into performance along with a different filter or perspective so to speak so that you too can be The Red Jacket in a sea of gray suits"
3,repetitive,"Don't get me wrong. The message is good if not new. The only problem is that the book could have easily been a 2 page pamphlet. Osteen speaks well, too well in fact and thats the problem. He repeats the same things again and again and again and ....in different ways of course. Joel, give your readers some credit. We get the message, whats the point in going on and on. Too many personal examples also make it boring. Read it once , highlight the main points and copy these down. You will have the 2 pages you need(I know because I did it myself)."
5,absolutely wonderful!!,"I picked this book up yesterday and could hardly put it down. It was awesome and lives up the positive humble approach that Joel Osteen does in his preaching. I am so happy to read a book that is so uplifting and gives me the feeling of can do. I loved reading about the hope and not so much doom and gloom. He says things in such a gentle way, and it's kind of like he takes your hand and pulls you along, out of the sinking mud and says like a child full of joy would say, ""Come with me... we can do this"". I think that is awesome. And I really loved hearing that God is such a good God and He wants to bless you. Not keep things from you for whatever reason you haven't yet figured out. How Joel feels about God in this book is very evident. God IS a good God! Only such a God as our God would send His Son to save us. God is not a meany and He didn't leave us here just to muddle thru. And that is why I loved this book. Hope restored. Me."
5,Pure Inspiration,Joel writes the same way he speaks. I can visualize him smiling as I read his words. I plan to read this book over and over. There is much to take in.
1,Came up short,"The blade length is listed as 4.84-inches, but the actual blade length, even stated on the box I received, is 3.5 inches. I don't feel like going through the hassle to return this item, because the mistake was not on my end to begin with. I also noticed that in the item description for the Evo ""Junior,"" they don't even list the blade length, but if you look it up elsewhere it is 2.5 inches for the junior. I don't get it? Why is it so difficult to get the length correct for the Evo and Evo junior on here?"
2,Inferior to the similar Columbia River M16,"It's not a ""bad"" knife, but it's not as good as a similar knife that already existed.There are already loads of pocket knives out there. If someone is going to make a knife similar to another person's design, they should at least try to improve upon it, not just make a cheaper version."
4,Great everyday knife,"I am a person that has to always have a knife on them. I get a little picky about about them too. Size, swiftness, clip, etc. This knife meets just about all of my needs. It's the perfect size, I hardly notice it clipped to the insides of my pocket. Even though I have recently grown fond of the assisted opening knives but the build of this knife allows me to flip it open just as fast. The clip is is very tight and prevents anything from getting snagged on it, and that is a big deal for me. So far the only thing that has bothered me is the other day when I was working on my car, I set my knife down on the ground and some how it got scratched up. I know it could not have brushed up against anything that bad, so it seems like it is not very scratch resistant. But that's what a knife is for, and for the price I was not to heart broken."
5,Perfect for subwoofers,"Works as advertised, good connection. Splits a mono signal into two - perfect for splitting a receiver subwoofer output into two to go into both the L and R inputs of your sub. You don't really need it but it will make the signal almost twice as strong (since the sub normally averages the L and R inputs), so the sub will be louder.Connections are good quality, and you can unscrew the ends and take a look at the solder (useful if you are concerned that a connection has gone bad)."
1,Really disappointed,I found this cd to be something less than smooth. I love Diana Krall's music but this does not reflect her style at all.
1,Disappointment,We were very disappointed when we received the book Cut and Engraved Glass 1771-1985 The Collector's guide to American Wares. We were expecting it to have photos of examples and it had none.We own several pieces of cut and engraved glass and wish to research other collectable pieces. The book was immediately returned ... as of this writing we have not received our refund.
3,RUBBERMAID SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS,WHEN YOU OPEN THE TOP TO USE THE SHAKER THE WHOLE TOP COMES OFF. IT WOULD BE BETTERIF THE TOP SCREWS ON LIKE THE OLDER ONES AND NOT SNAP ON. POOR DESIGN.
3,good for use,I like these but love the older model .these seem to not shut well and have pulled the lid off when trying to open them for use
2,"Great concept, disappointing execution","My husband farms, and I am often taking his meals out to the field. I wanted these for portable, non-breakable salt and pepper shakers that (most importantly) would not SPILL. The little lids with covers are a great concept. However, the lids do not snap tightly onto the body of the shaker. They sometimes come off, leaving piles of salt or pepper spilled in my box. Also, the hinges on the covers are very poor, and we often would take off the entire cover when trying to open them. Very disappointing! I usually expect better from Rubbermaid."
1,False Advertising - Beware,"Bought this item based on the picture but the product we received looks nothing like the picture or the description. The ones we received are smaller and barely latch. The tops come off real easily. They are basically useless. The package says that they are great for glitter, spices, and decorating candies. Definitely not salt and pepper shakers for in a lunch pail.Be aware of what you what you are purchasing. The ones sold for $3-$4 are not the ones in the picture. This is false advertising and needs to be taken care of. The sellers who are in on this should be ashamed of themselves."
1,Shipping cost disparity,"I am familiar enough with the product to be satisfied if it is in fact the Rubbermaid product offered. However, the company listed inaccurate shipping costs. $0 per order, + $0.99 per pound. This package could hardly weigh more than a pound, at the most, two. They charged me $6.13 for Shipping and handling, so that a $3.30 item cost $9.43. This would have been a deal-breaker had they listed charges accurately and honestly."
2,disappointed,"I have looked far and wide for salt and pepper shakers that seal out moisture. I have always liked Rubbermaid products so I was excited to find these. However, when they arrived I was quite disappointed. The covers are white and both were quite dirty & gray. They did clean up pretty well and I will use them, but I expected more from Rubbermaid."
3,Good player for the $ but recorder almost useless,"This is a good little player with MDLP,but pointless as a recorder.As a recorder:IT HAS NO INPUTS but a usb.No line in or microphone.The Net MD simple burner software used to load a CD onto MD will only work in the downright bad sounding LP2 or even worse LP4 format.This will sound just fine to the tone deaf people who think that MP3 sounds anything but horrible.The Sonic Stage program compresses WAV down to 192 kbs even if you want to record the MD in SP mode.This makes the SP mode sound just as bad as LP2.What a shame Net MD dosen't use the MD format to it's full potential.On SP mode MD sounds quite good.1/10AS a player:Six stage bass and treble are a very nice touch.The sound through a good set of phones is pleasant.As usuall with almost all modern walkman type gear there is a pathetic lack of volume.That's just the way it goes today.If you like it loud like I do,pick up a good headphone amp.sound quality 9/10output power 4/10"
1,Seller is a thief-EEK technology,"I bought this Minidisk player and it didn't work. I returned it to the seller, EEK technology and sent me a replacement. The second was also defective. I got their ok to return this and I still haven't a replacement player. I have wrote to them and they have blown me off. DO NOT BUY FROM EEK Technology. They are theives!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,works good,works good. can fold to adjust big and small bins. gripper type bottom great to keep from sliding around. fitsmperfect between front seats in out van...no more searching for stuff rolling around
5,Exactly what I need,"This organizer is exactly what I needed! I can store everything in it! I have a 1987 Nissan truck--5 speed with no console, so this organizer was a life saver for me!"
3,not as nice as I had hoped,"Product wasn't flush when put together, the front piece was the only one stained, back pieces have rough edges. The drawers do work just fine despite these flaws."
2,Way too Big & Heavy,"We received this and had to return it right away.It is huge and very heavy. It would not fit in our sink or on our stove.The color was nice and quality was good, but is is huge and my wife could not lift it.There are better choices out there. Keep looking...."
5,Ecellent value,"I bought this pan for my wife and she loves it. Well worth the price and it is healthy to cook in. You will not have to worry about peeling non-stick, aluminum or stainless leaching chromium. Good old fashioned cast iron covered with porcelain enamel. It doesn't get any better......"
3,Good for healthy cooking difficult to clean,"I wish I could say I love this pan and if it was easier to clean I would. Beside grilling veggies which are wonderful I grill things that have been in a marinate and if that marinate has any sugar or honey it will burn and be very very difficult to clean out of the pan. I've tried coating the pan before with spray oil and it did not help much, I've even taken to rinsing the top coat of the marinate off before cooking, but who really wants to rinse the flavor off before cooking? If I didn't already have this I may choose different one next time."
4,"RRay 11"" Cast-Iron Fry Pan","This pan does all it's expected to do. Unfortunately, the wife feels it's too heavy - especially when compared with her ""existing"" cast-iron fry pan. I recall the UPS shipping site showed the shipped weight as 11 Lbs."
2,Disappointed,"I had been wanting this grill pan forever and finally got it as a Christmas present. I hate to say it since I love Rachael's Bubble & Browns, but I am disappointed with this pan. After only a few uses, there are burnt-on spots that do not come off no matter what I use to clean them. Also, the enamel glaze on the inside has ""crackled"" already and it looks awful. It is VERY heavy and I can't lift this into the oven by myself when it is full of food. If only someone had thought to put a helper handle on the other side of this pan, the weight wouldn't be a problem. Disappointed."
4,"EVOlution - less inspired than Bio-Vital, but still great","Decoded Feedback's latest release, EVOlution, has a great sound, but note that this is not a completely new album. While all of the tracks on the CD are previously unreleased material, 7 of the 13 tracks are remixes, and a few of the new tracks seem a little bland. Still, Decoded Feedback delivers a healthy dose of industrial goodness with EVOlution. If you're a Decoded Feedback fan, go ahead and purchase this album...you won't regret it."
4,!!! WAY BETTER THAN TECHNOPHOBY !!!,"I FIRST HEARD OF DF AT A RECORD STORE WHEN A SALES GUY TOLD ME THEY SOUNDED LIKE WUMPSCUT. I PICKED UP THE DISK TECHNOPHOBY, AND WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED. IT SOUNDED SO BASIC, AND LACKING ANYTHING THAT REALLY APPEALED TO ME. I GAVE UP ON THEM PRETTY FAST. YEARS LATER A FRIEND WAS LISTENING TO THIS DISK, AND I ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS. I WAS FLOORED WHEN HE TOLD ME IT WAS THESE GUYS. WHAT A GOOD CD! SO MUCH MORE EVOLVED THAN THEIR PREVIOUS DISK, THIS ALBUM WAS A TRIUMPH OVER IT. GREAT BEATS, GOOD VOX, AND A NICE FLOW MAKE THIS A GOOD LISTEN, WHEN YOURE IN THE MOOD."
4,Great book,"This is a great book for those who would like to understand the Islamic culture in a deeper way. The scenarios in the book are real-to-life situations in an Islamic household in the Middle East. The book also gives the reader a taste of what often happens when a Muslim decides to become a Christian. Although the book is a bit idealistic at some points, it is a quick, good read."
2,disapointed me!!,"Two years ago when I didn't know anything about opera I thought this version of Pagliacci was the best one. Nowadays that I've listened other versions I find out that the only thing that this version must preserve as good are the ochestra (Pretre) and Pons.Here Domingo sounds not as good as he usualy does, and not talking about Stratas that must preserve in the contemporary repertoire, Not Iatalian opera for Stratas!! It seems that she dosen't feel really Italian opera.I can recomend other Pagliacci's versions: Corelli, Gobbi or di Stefano, Gobbi. Believe me there are better versions than this one."
3,A bit disappointing,"This book is interesting in some ways but heavily focused on facilities and process rather than the history of development of some of the critical technologies. A good reference but a bit disappointing.For most readers interested in Soviet missile development I would recommend Zaloga's The Kremlin's Nuclear Sword: The Rise and Fall of Russia's Strategic Nuclear Forces. Covers some of the early debates on missile development and strategy, with special emphasis on competition between the design bureaus.Note that both of these books only focuses on Strategic missiles, as their titles certainly acknowledge, so there is little detail on short and intermediate range missiles except for the earliest missiles such as the SS-3 and SS-4. If you are looking for Scud information you won't find it here unless you are looking for the submarine launched version."
2,Okay but not well made,"There are 16 chapters. There is an annoying noise when it goes from one chapter to the next. After chapter 13 it won't go to chapter 14. You have to go back to the menu, choose 'Chapters' and then select chapter 14 in order to go through to the end. Some interesting information for fans, so for the price it's okay."
3,Very cute and girly like.,"Perfect for little hands and arms. My two yr old daughter has a collection of purses already and this seems to be one of her favorites. The items that come with the purse is is alittle cheesy, but the purse is the important item in this case. Enjoy!"
3,A little Cheap looking,This does not look like the picture the colors are darker and it looks cheap. I was ultimately not very happy with this gift but for a 2 year old I don't think she noticed.
5,1 yr old loves it!!!,My neice loves it. She really likes the cell phone. She is so cute with her little purse! She loves the little mirror in it.
4,first purse,The little ones like imitating mommy and carrying this adorable purse with all its contents. A hit with all my granddaughters: 18 months to 3 yrs.
5,Lots of fun,"Just got this for my little girl's 2nd birthday and she loves it! The lipstick, phone and keys are her favorite accessories. She's added some of her own as well and likes taking the purse with her on car rides. The whole thing is really cute."
5,Great purse,"My two year and six year girls love their purses and all the things that come inside. They even play ""people"" with my four year old son and put all the stuff they can find that will fit into the purse and go about with their imagination."
3,bare bones,"I love the idea of this toy and I've seen really cute versions. this one is very no frills. it was as if they said ""how can we produce this as cheaply as possible?"" when they were producing it. some examples: the cute flower that you see on the front of the purse? it's only on one side of the bag. they could have put it on both sides at least for the tactile entertainment of their young customers. the phone has hard molded buttons. you can't push them in- squish them. what's the point of a fake cell phone for toddlers that has buttons you can't squish? that's their favorite part. the wallet has no hinge, it will break off after the kid opens it 5 times. the fake lipstick tube has no cover. would it have killed them to put a cover on the lipstick? it could be large so no one chokes on it, but, that would have been a bit more fun. overall, this version looks cute, but, doesn't have that much going for it. try a different one, if you're asking me."
4,Purse,The purse is great. It has provided hours of fun for my 16 month old. She loves to talk on the phone and put on lipstick. I would recommend this to everyone with a little girl.
2,ok. boring.,"Colorful and cute, but a bit boring. Cell phone that comes with it is huge and outdated style. The buttons cannot be pushed and have no sound. Make-up compact case does not open. Lip stick does not turn. So my daughter 1 1/2 years old has got bored with this toy quickly. I must say it was a waste of my money even though it was very cheap. I do not recommend this toy to other parents with daughters."
5,Entertained for hours!,"My 18-mo daughter loves going through my purse every night, just taking things out and putting them back in. I thought it would be fun to get her own purse that she could tote around, instead of my huge work bag. She hasn't put this does since she received it. She loves the keys and the ""lip stuff"", and pretends to chat on the phone. But really, I think, she just likes being like mommy and having a bag of her own. The pieces are clearly inexpensive, but it doesn't look like it will break anytime soon. For a toddler to just tote around the house for fun, it was a great buy. If you are looking for an ""exact replica"" type toy, this isn't it - but it's perfect for my daughter who gets joy out of filling her little bag, then emptying it back out."
4,Simple fun for make-believe,"My daughter (who just turned two) enjoys playing with this. She puts the items into and out of the purse constantly. She isn't thrilled with the phone, since she has others that make noise (although I don't mind a toy that will stimulate her imagination over time). Also, she can't open the snap closure on the wallet by herself. It will help her fine motor skills to practice, though. It is absulutely priceless - yes, the pun is intended - to here her say ""muh-neee"" as she carries around her first debit card ;)"
4,reviewing for my 3 year-old niece,"I bought this as a present for my 3 year-old niece. Seems that it made her older sister quite jealous, and any toy that kids fight over, is a good one... Unless you're the parent.Quality is good, not that cheap dollar store stuff you can find. I would probably buy this again if there was another young girl in our family."
4,Great First Purse!,"I bought this for my daughter (21 months at the time) for Christmas so she would stop trying to carry my purse around all the time, and it was a GREAT buy! It has lots of great goodies for kids to play with, and my daughter loves to carry it around. I only have 2 complaints: (1) the phone buttons cannot be pressed. I am fine without them having batteries or making noise, but it is irritating that they can't even be pressed. My daughter got frustrated pretty quick with that. (2) The little wallet is hard for kid fingers to open, so it is pretty much worthless. My daughter stopped playing with it almost immediately.Aside from those two things, I think this purse is great - the pieces are durable and fun and it is just the right size for my toddler."
5,Great for Little Girls,Grand daughter loved it. Hasn't put it down since getting it for Christmas. She packs every thing she can inside and off she goes. She's 20 months old going on 15 a real diva.
4,great starter purse,"My daughter got this purse for Christmas when she was 1 yr old and she loved it. It's very durable and all stays together in the little purse. Now my daughter is 27 mths old and still likes it, but sometimes prefers more realistic things - like mommy/daddy's phone! I think this is a great investment and recommend it for little girls. When she was 1, I was more careful with the lipstick (not that she would swallow it b/c it's nice and fat, but that she would gag on it), but now that she's older (2+), I don't worry about it at all. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is b/c I don't know how old she'll be before she'll stop playing with it. Definitely a good buy."
3,My First Purse,"My 15 mo old loves this toy. She carries around parts of it everywhere and she likes to put things into the purse. She gets so frustrated when she can't open the plastic wallet, but her frustration can be really cute. She wants so badly to be able to do everything. She even enjoys the phone, even though it doesn't light up like other play (or even real!) phones."
5,My First Purse,I bought this last year for Christmas for my then one year old granddaughter. She loved it. She loved all the items that came with the purse too. I would highly recommend this item.
5,My 1-year old's favorite toy!,"My daughter received this for her first birthday and by far it was her favorite present! She was constantly taking my credit cards when we go out and now she has her own! She loves to look in the mirror and ""put lipstick on"". She carries this purse around the house all day long. Very safe - none of the toys seem breakable and none seem to be a choking hazard. I would highly recommend this for every 1-year old little girl who loves to play in mommy's purse."
3,Neat but crappy phone,As far a the look of purses goes this is a adorable look but the phone is just hard plastic and you can't even press the numbers. You can get a phone at the $1 store that makes noises when you press the button so I was dissapointed with the phone. I purchased a phone to go with the purse. The other things are cute. My daughter is 19 months and at that age they want a phone that can do something. If it wasn't for the fact that I liked everything else I would have returned it.
5,Best gift my 2 1/2 year old got for Christmas,"My little girl loves to carry around all her ""treasures"", whether it be in a paper bag, a bucket, her snack bowl... So I put ""play purse"" on her Christmas list, and she got this one from an aunt.She ADORES it!!! It is by far her favorite gift this year. After 2 months, she is still carrying it around. She ""puts on"" the lipstick (and puts it on me and her brothers too). She carries her other little toys around in the purse. It's just great overall. My 1-year old son is also fascinated by the purse and all it's contents. I like it cuz it's durable and not one thing out of the bag has gotten broken. Amazingly, she's even kept all the pieces together.Big thumbs up from us girls!"
3,cute,"I bought this for my 3 yr old. It is very cute and has neat fillers, but it is a bit boring. she played with it for 30 minutes and has not touched it since."
5,Made a 2-year-old smile...,"...and her soon-to-be 5-year-old older sister seemed like she wouldn't have minded if Santa would have brought her this purse too. Nothing like seeing a little girl's face light up. I'm glad I got this soft and cute purse her for Christmas...(the reviews here helped)! It would be nice, if for even a couple of dollars more, the cell phone had a bell or push button with a tone, ring or something. Nonetheless, it's still a sweet gift and not too bad for the price."
2,seattlemom,Got this for my daughter last Christmas. She loved it for about ten seconds. The contence are not very interactive and nothing that makes you say wow! She ended up filling the bag part with other things. I guess it would be fine for some kids but not very interactive or durable for the money you could put your own bag together and have tons more fun.
5,Fun toy for a toddler.,My daughter really enjoys playing with this toy. It's durable and safe. It is smooth and has no funny smells or anything. I gave it 5 stars for educational because why not? All young ladies need to learn to take care of themselves and their things--especially their purses. :) She is learning how to pack her purse and carry it with her and copy mommy. We love it!
2,Not what I thaught,On Christmas my little sis was like what's this she hated it I would not buy this buy it for like little girls who have emagination waste of 30$ :(
1,Never received,Never received item. It was not in stock and took way to long to get so had to cancel. Very disappointed.
5,Bought for my 2 year old neice,Bought this for our neice for christmas and she hasnt put it down since. Pretty durable..but just wish the purse was a little bigger because she likes to stick a few of her other toys in there with it. But other than that..its great.
4,"Kidoozie, My First Purse",I ordered this for my little great niece who is 2. Her Mom says she loves it and carries it around a lot. Shipping was very prompt also. I have always been pleased ordering through Amazon.
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"In theory this is a great toy, but the manufacturers skimped on the quality. It would have been nice if the lipstick went up or down or made clicking noises. Also, the cellular phone does not make any sounds at all and the buttons do not depress. If these features were improved, it would make for a better toy."
1,Not worth the $20,Looks good in the picture but when I received it I was very disappointed on how cheap it was. Looks like something I would pick up at the $1 store.
2,Child purse review,"The items included were cute but the phone made no noise, the little containers are hard to open , the fake lipstick was to large for a tot and the little plastic case the purse was in is wasteful. My grandchild did like the purse but dumped out all the playthings and put in her own things. I think there could be improvement. I bought this for a 2 year old"
5,Great 1st Purse for Girls,My daughter loved this purse and everything that came with it was durable and lasted over a year. Great idea for a 1st purse for your daughter or grandaughter.
2,Can't press the buttons on the phone,"I was a little disappointed in this purse. Gifted it to a little girl who just turned 3, and she LOVED the wallet, debit card, and lipstick. The purse itself was covered in a hard plastic that made it look still packaged, and the phone was pretty substandard. Because the buttons wouldn't press in, she kept trying to see if she could get candy out of it!"
3,"okay pretend purse, but my daughter still likes mine better","This is an okay child's purse. My 2 yr old daughter will sometimes tote it around, but she still prefers my purse. Do I regret getting it? No. It's cute enough for what you pay for it, but I wouldn't highly recommend it either."
5,Perfect!,I bought this for my 2 year old neice for Christmas. As soon as she opened it she put it on her arm and carried it around while she was opening all of her other presents. She loved the phone and everthing was a perfect size for her.
5,For the girly girl,I got this for my niece as a present. I looked all over for a little girl purse. I loved this one because of the value and all of the additional accessories. The colors were perfect for the little princess. She loves her purse and her big girl stuff. It is fairly durable and has been easy to clean.
3,Adorable little purse,"I purchased this for my granddaughter who is 2 years old and she absolutely loved the purse. However, the items on the inside were not realistic enough for her. I was disappointed that the cell phone didn't at least ring or beep and none of the keys were movable. She loves the lipstick but kept asking why it didn't have a cover. The wallet and mirror are her favorites. This gift is probably best for children between 1 year and 18 months old."
4,Fun Purse,"We gave our 21 month old daughter this purse and she LOVES it. She walks around with it all the time. She enjoys putting cards in the little plastic container and is constantly ""talking"" on the phone. My only criticism, as others have stated, is that the phone doesn't make any noises. I'd like it to be more interactive. Other than that, it's a fantastic little toy!"
4,A cute purse for my 3 year old,My 3 year old loves to play with purses. This one looks cute and the toys inside seem well made and realistic. She likes to pull her phone out and talk while she walks around with the purse.
5,My First Purse,"This was a present for my daughter's first birthday. She still may be a little young for it, but loves to carry it around the house."
4,My girls really enjoy it,"My twin girls got this when they turned two and they both love it and still have it at almost 3 1/2. My only complaint is the little plastic card holder. For some reason, neither of the girls can open it. But overall, they love the purse and it's lasted this long with very destructive twins!"
3,"Good for babies, not toddlers/preschoolers","I had this on my daughter's wishlist, and she got it from a friend right before her 3rd birthday. The purse itself is good, and the stuff like the debit card/wallet and lipstick are cute for her, but the keys and phone, the stuff she'd normally love, are really aimed at the 1yr old crowd. I figured it'd be a bit more, since it was for 2 and up, but there's nothing there that I'd have a problem giving a baby. We have a fun phone that swap for her, and saw some electronic keys at target I'm going to replace those with. So, overall, not bad, but I wouldn't get it for an older toddler/preschooler."
4,Fun for pretend,"I wouldn't say this is a good purse for a first purse unless your child is old enough to play pretend with other toys.My baby is turning 1 and she does not play much with it's contents. This toy would be better at age 2 or 2.5 years old.My 2.5 year old son likes to say ""bye"" and pretend to be going out the door with it which is fun to watch.I like it for the pretend play factor because the cell phone doesn't have lights and their is a fake plastic credit card if your kids want to pretend they are going to the store. The keys are a bit flimsy and so is the hard plastic purple case. The mirror is cute, but small. If you are looking for more durable items or items that are functional (the lipstick doesn't move up and down either) then you might want to find a first purse somewhere else. I have yet to find one that will work for us."
5,BRINGS IT EVERYWHERE...,"Most days we don't leave home without one of her purses, and this one is right up there. My daughter is 2 and 4 months and has been playing with it since her second birhtday."
5,The perfect gift for a little girl,"I bought this for my niece's 2nd birthday. She is very much a girlie girl and LOVED it. She never leaves the house without it. While she has figured out that the lipstick is ""not real"", she still continues to apply it. Great price, and a big hit. I would highly recommend this for any little girl."
4,Very Cute.....,".....this was purchased for my daughter for her first birthday. It's very cute, and I can see her playing with it a bit more as she gets older. Right now she's more into the ""take the stuff out of the purse and put it back in"" stage, but still......a neat little toy for the lil miss in your life!"
1,Cheap and flimsy and damaged!,"My 14 month old runs around the house with an old Liz Claiborne purse that she found in the bottom of my closet. She loves it but the handles are too long for her and I wanted to get her something more bright and fun, so I ordered this for Christmas.When I got it in the mail I was excited...until I opened it. It's JUNK! Seriously, I could do better at the dollar store!! The flower is already partially coming undone, the plastic phone edges on the top are razor sharp, the mirror is flaking and this is JUST OUT OF THE BOX! I'm shipping this piece of crap back. I am less than impressed with this item."
3,This is cute.....,"I bought this for my daughter, Kaylee, for her first birthday. I couldn't resist I had to give it to her early. Even though she is alittle to young for it, I could tell she liked it. She pulls everything out and puts it back in...over and over again. And when I grab my purse, she gets hers. It's adorable. My only problem with it is the toys inside the purse look really cheap. And there is no way that my daugter could open the carrying case, it is to small. But all in all after having a 4 year old boy, buying alittle purse and watching my daughter play with it, I cant help but love it!"
5,My girl love it!!!!,I order this on Amazon for my daughter's 2nd bday and she simply love it :) Its very cute and she love the accessories that came with it. Great quality for the price :)
4,Long lasting fun,"I purchased this as a christmas gift for my daughter when she was 16 months old. Now, she's 3 and is still playing with it. For the price it's worth buying. All parts have held up so far."
2,Where's the Beef?,"My daughter recieved this purse as a gift and we found it was missing some of the pieces. Since the pieces were sealed in a bag, it was a clearly problem from the manufacturer. When we went to exchange it, we found all of the purses on the shelf were missing at least the mirrors! Pretty bad quality control, if you ask me. We ended up stuck with an incomplete toy... pretty dissapointing."
3,Cute but borderline inappropriate,"Bought this as a gift for niece based on reviews. It is a cute toy, but I feel that putting a play lipstick as a toy is questionable since this is for toddlers. Do we really want to be teaching our toddlers that they need to be wearing lipstick? I know girls like to mimic their moms, but I think it would have been more appropriate to include a checkbook or notepad and pen, or even a little stuffed animal instead. There will be plenty of time for makeup without pushing it on a toddler."
4,Nice plaything for the very young,"I bought this for my 20-month old daughter for Christmas, and she enjoys carrying the purse around and taking things in and out of it. I suspect that it won't be too long before she prefers to have a phone she can push buttons on and some lip stuff she can actually apply, but it is a nice plaything for now!"
4,Cute purse,"My 1 1/2-year-old received this for Christmas. She likes to carry the purse around and talk on the phone. She doen't really play with the other things in it, but it is still really cute."
5,Psion Parallel Printer Link: essential add-on for mobile use,"I use a Psion 5mx and a Series 7 extensively as a physician using ChartNotes. In the office, I print out patient notes via PsiWin and the linked printer via my desktop. In the hospital, however, or elsewhere, I can print out patient notes, or any document I choose, directly to any available printer, using the Parallel Printer link and the accompanying printer drivers in the Psion, freeing me from the need to lug around a small, expensive, slow portable printer. The Parallel Printer cable fits in my pocket, and can be attached to any printer with a parallel port instantly for immediate printing, making the 5mx or S7 even more versatile. Essential for mobile computing with a Psion!"
4,It's the Truth!,"I found the book up to date and concise, giving the details of prophecy as I have understood it, has confirmed what I have already known, but has given new insights. The book was written by a personal friend, so perhaps I'm prejudiced."
3,NEGATIVE RATING RETRACTION,"I recently gave a rating of #1 to AIRPORTPLACEBOOKS because of receiving a Reba McEntire cd that appeared to be blank and I got no feedback from this seller in a timely manner when I inquired.Just logged on (5/27) and see that I have now received a reply. They will be sending me a refund and they apologize for their delay in contacting me. I am, therefore, RETRACTING my negative rating and giving them a *** rating.Thanks airportplacebooks"
5,Simply the BEST in country music videos!,"Reba McEntire has been called the Queen of Country Music and the videos on this collection proove why! She is an amazing vocalist and she uses her videos to display the emotion in each song. She is the video pioneer in country music and as a young artist she understood the importance of the music video. It was, and still is, the perfect way for the artist to give the fans something extra. Reba has always given her fans the best and releasing her videos is the best way to show your fans how much you love them! Thanks Reba!"
5,Simply the Best,"I finally got around to buying both DVD's. It matters not to me whether a particular song is classifed as country, rock, folk, pop, or whatever. All I know is that Reba McEntire moves, inspires, and delights me as no other singerof our generation. A beautiful voice and a heart so kind you can feel it across a continent. I've enjoyed great music videos since the Beatles' Paperback Rider/Rain in 1966. Reba is right up there with the very best."
2,Video Gold more like bronze!,"I love Reba and her music, but this DVD is lacking in the quality department. This is so unlike Reba to allow a product of this quality get out to the public. The music and the video aren't in synch. Her mouth moves, and then the words come out. I sent the first one back, but the next one was the same way. So I'm guessing they are all like that. I kept it because I wanted it bad enough. But to the average person, don't bother."
2,Expected much more.,The only reason I purchased this DVD was Tammy Parks (aka Bambi Newberry). It is hard to find her DVD appearances but I continue to pursue them. This one was just too brief and she was not a lead character. Maybe worth it if you buy this one for $1 otherwise head to Titanic 2000 for a lot more of Tammy!
5,A wonderful read for anyone who's ever been a child!,"Although I purchased this book specifically because Susan Klein grew up on Martha's Vineyard (an island I adore), I fell in love with it for the childhood she describes. Many of the short stories (some only a page) describe the idyllic childhood of days gone by - when a 5 year old could ride her new bike unsupervised, and older children formed teams to play strategic games for hours on end. But Susan Klein does a remarkable job of encapsulating all that growing up entails - the real and the imagined pains of childhood, as well as the joy. She touches upon so many subjects that you might mistakenly think it is a heavy read - broken families, religion, the challenge of making ends meet. But mostly it is a collection of stories that will warm your heart, and sometimes make you laugh outloud. Now, if only there were a sequel so I would know what happened to her best friend David..."
5,Panasonic edtv,"After much research, I still had some questions regarding the performance of the EDTV vs HDTV, but since my purchase of the Panasonic 42PD60U TV, I couldn't imagine the HDTV version being ""that"" much better. This TV has an incredible picture and is very user friendly. A great value!"
3,"Panasonic TH-42PD60U 42"" Plasma EDTV","I recommend this TV be used with a HD receiver to get the best out of it. The TVs surround sound isnt that great, you can see a litle shadowing when viewing up close, but looks great from normal viewing distance. It is very bright which is good. The remote is great, it is pretty large with big buttons. I also recommend connecting DVD players, HD Tuners, etc. with the HDMI connector, it reallly make the movies look and sound better. You dont have to buy an expensive cable, I know amazon sells some for like $1.50. Over all this TV is great for the bedrooms, but for the living room, try getting a 1080p plasma, this one is only 480p"
3,Not clear from the listing...,"I can't tell from this listing whether the price is for a single leg or a set of two. The image shows a pair, but the listing says ""Item quantity 1."" What's the deal here?"
3,Interesting Irish History,Not as helpful as I hoped but it is historically interesting. I will look for the next time period to track my family.
1,Not effective for me.,"I took one bottle over 4 weeks and felt nothing. The directions say allow up to 4 weeks to take full effect. I suppose it's possible that this product may affect some people and not others. The only thing I know of that definitely raises testosterone other than diet, exercise, and rest would be getting testosterone from a doctor."
1,Not for me,"After almost 3 bottles, I had rapid heartbeat, dizziness and shortness of breath. Not sure I had any of the benefits since you have to take 2 bottles to even see them. Either way I stopped taking them and now have a bottle and a half that I have no idea what do with."
1,no good,This stuff just made my heart rate go up and made me feel like I was gonna have a heart attack all the time. My energy levels were the same and workouts did not improve anymore than normal. I figured I would try it my self to see if it worked and indeed it does not. I would not reccomend this product to anyone.
2,felt more aggressive,"the only thing this has done is make me feel a little more aggressive. maybe it does boost testosterone, but i did not feel any stronger, nor any sex drive improvement, only more aggressive."
3,Shady booster,"Another shady testosteron booster, number 1 in the world....yeah right.Firstly i don`t understand the reason of pressing te tribulus into a pill..other than the fact that there may not be much tribulus in the first place?I`d suggest that you do some research before buying this, you can start from here [...]"
4,Excellent value,"Using them for Polk RTi 6 speakers. They work very well. Bases are heavy, solid construction, excellent value!"
1,Awful.,Truly ugly and ungainly made in China pieces of junk. Unless you are 12 don't even contemplate these for use as doorstops. One star is too generous.
1,Speaker stands,"These are a piece of junk, after i put my speakers on them they fell apart. The welds were spot welds and crappy!"
4,Good for the price,"I have ended up really liking these stands for my BlueSky speakers and have them extended to full height. I did have a challenge with the threads being painted over, making assembly tougher than it needed to be. Other than that, very pleased with them for the price."
3,Nothing Special,"Got these stands mostly based on price and other customer reviews. OK construction and I like the hollow tube in which to run the speaker wire. Mounting plate is VERY basic (square, four holes, limited adjustability). No instructions for assembly but limited parts make it fairly intuitive. They didn't fit my speakers (Klipsch Synergy Quintet III) so I had to modify with wood blocks so I could attach the speakers. Looks ugly! Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for. You may want to research if these will fit what ever you want to mount to them. Heavy base makes them fairly stable."
2,Poor Quality,"One of the speaker stands is missing the threading to screw into the base, so I just have a metal pole and a base.The adjustable speaker holder does not contract enough to hold the speaker unit. Also, I was at first puzzled that there were no assembly instructions. So no I'm stuck, either send them back and pay anoher S/H fee or to sell them at a flea market. Useless product, made in China."
2,OK for the price,"The plastic bits that hold the telescoping poles together can strip easily, but if you're careful, and don't plan on moving them around once you set them up, they should do just fine."
4,Adjustable stand for small speakers,"After researching many speaker stands, I finally found this adjustable pair for my voice-over studio. They're perfect for holding my compact Alesis M1Active 320 USB monitors. The base is heavy and the top can accommodate speakers of different sizes without having to screw them in place, thus damaging the speaker.After 10 months, the pole of one of the stands unexpectedly broke right where it was attached to the base. That's where the metal is at its thinnest. When I told the seller about the problem, they immediately shipped out a replacement set at no charge. Now, that's great customer service!"
3,"For the price, they'll do","Have some of the same issues as others: No instructions (but intuitively enough to assemble without), painted threads which makes it a little difficult to screw the poles into the base, a little wiggley and lastly, can't adjust the height on my pair because of the irregular pole sizes. I did use some velcro at the bottom of my 3"" speakers due to them being smaller than the gap size. At the end of the day, they'll do for the price."
2,"Fair, But Buy Live Action Instead","This was o.k. It was not nearly as good as Peter Jacksons live action version, but it wasn't all that bad. It was pretty corney, the orcs and all the things like that in the live action were way cooler, and the music is extroridnarly cheesy. But if you have a little kid who is too young to see the live action, this is a good alternative."
1,Horrible!,"These three animated movies are horrible to watch! Director Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy is way better than these three boring movies. Each movie, ""The Hobbit""; ""The Lord of the Rings""; and ""The Return of the King"", greatly deviate from author J.R.R. Tolkien's book trilogy. These animated movies are completely pointless to watch and are a disgrace to Tolkien's Middle-earth. Do not buy any of these movies!...Director Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy is well worth watching; but not these movies."
1,Not very good.,"The only film here that is even remotely good is the Hobbit. Bakshi's Lord of the Rings is dreadfully dull, choppy and poorly animated, and is so inferior to the recent live-action films as to be unwatchable. The Rankin-Bass Return of the King is even worse, taking what should be high drama and turning it into a laughable hodge-podge of childish songs and bizarre characterization.Invest in Peter Jackson's trilogy insted, and just wait for him to do the Hobbit."
1,How to get depressed without suffering a major life trauma,"The Return of the King as envisioned by Bakshi is quite possibly the worst movie ever made, with the possible exception of the legendary Plan 5 From Outer Space.The animation is of terrible quality, surpassing only that of a Hanna-Barbara cartoon of the 1970's - and then only because body parts other than the mouth move.I literally got depressed watching this because it was so bad. Certainly, I got it from the library with masochistic intent, but this is just ridiculous."
2,Doesn't even come Close to giving Tolkien his due.,The Hobbit is actually an alright version of the three but the other two just throw off the story and do no justice to the themes and feel of Middle-Earth.I guess I buy the Hobbit because it is a kids book and made a kids cartoon. However the return of the king is done the same doesn't not grasp the gravity or climax that the book has.The middle one is just plain terrible. It hop skips and jumps its way through the Fellowship and part of the Two Towers really skewing Tolkien's work.Buy the Hobbit for the kids and wait until Jackson's trilogy is complete and on DVD for the Lord of the Rings. Or just read the book.
5,Brings Back Memories...,"I remember watching these animated Middle-Earth movies growing up. I used to love watching them and still love watching them to this day. Now that I gladly own all three of these movies on DVD I can now watch them any time I want. But I must say that these wonderful classics do not get enough credit at all! THE HOBBIT, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and THE RETURN OF THE KING, are all equally wonderful animated movies based on Tolkien's world. The animation, music (score), voice acting, and plot in each film are absolutely brilliant! Even though THE LORD OF THE RINGS animated movie was never completed, that doesn't mean that it is a horrible movie. Sure I was dissapointed! But I understood that it took a lot of work and stress, even to make an animated movie, based on Tolkien's world back in the 1970's. If you really do understand J.R.R. Tolkien's works, then you should buy all three of these animated movies. If not, then don't buy them!"
3,Great pack for the price!,"I used to have all these on VHS, but I decided it was time to upgrade them to DVD. However, there seems to be a problem with the formatting or something with the DVD because the sound is VERY low and the picture has black lines on the right and left side for some reason instead of being widescreen."
3,LOTR animated films,The Hobbit is a great movie. Fellowship was very drawn out and boring. Still have yet to watch Return of the King; but I absolutely enjoy the animation of the Hobbit
3,For kids,"The Hobbit and return of the king are the best in this series. The Lord of the rings skips a ton of stuff, makes samwise look ugly, and leaves out over half the story line, making it impossible to know whom is whom. The other two are from a japenese company that unfortaunatly went out of bissness befor e doing the rest. These are meant for younger audience and their hobbits are not realistic, still, they do not change it to much."
4,JUST LOVE LORD OF THE RINGS IN ANY FORM..,I already had this boxed set but I have a son-in-law that wanted it as he has all the movies and figurines. He is enjoying it very much
3,pretty good movies,The Hobbit is the best one by far butWhere theres a Whip Theres A Way makes LOTR much better.The animated versions included a lot of the feeling that the live action left out. I was a big fan of the Dwarven drinking songs.I wish they included that song in the live action.
3,Classic Renditions That Have Been Overshadowed by Jackon's..,"Although not the most accurate when compared to the book, these three movies are entertaining in their own way. When I got myself into Tolkien back 10 years ago, I remembered from my Childhood in the 80s a certain song ""Frodo of the Nine Fingers and the Ring of Doom"". This made me search out all three of these movies and I must say that until Peter Jackson did his renditions, they were sufficient. Clearly the two bookend movies that are entirely cartoon are the better. The combination of live action and cartoon done by Bakshi in his ""Lord of the Rings"" is awful. However, all three hold novelty value simply to see how Lord of the Rings was envisioned prior to modern computer animation and special effects. If for nothing else, view these three movies simply to hear the songs in ""Return of the King""!"
5,"A great CD, but seven more tunes are still out there","This splendid CD is a reissue of 12 of the 19 Sir Charles Thompson tunes Vanguard issued in a double LP album of the same name many years ago. Thompson and his sidekicks (saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, trumpeters Joe Newman and Chu Berry, guitarist Freddie Greene) are great on these 12 tunes, but the missing seven songs are just as great. Let's hope they're part of another reissue the label will put out very soon. Meanwhile, check out Sir Charles on some later CDs he's cut for the Delmark label."
2,"Great Muisc, poor storage","These are musical titans. So, the music is without a doubt superior.In this day and age of downloadable music, I buy CDs just as much for the printed matter. To learn more about the sessions.For this CD, the pamphlet was water damaged (bad storage?) so I couldn't separate the pages.For this, I felt considering the price, I was upset.The CD functions fine. The music makes me forget almost everything else!"
