5,Excellent Technical Death Metal,"This is one of THE most underated Deathmetal albums I have ever heard. The guitar riffs are very thrashy and technical in the early 90s tradition. Excellent leadwork and rythms puntuate the entire album. The middle section of Plagued Birth is just killer. The vocalist is exceptionally brutal with a hoarse raspy Martin Van Drunen souding growl. Severe Psychopathology and Plagued Birth are two of the stand out tracks, although all 7 are excellent. I wish this kind of Deathmetal lasted a bit longer because bands like this just don't hardly exist anymore. If you are a Pestilence, Gorguts, or Oppressor fan I highly reccommend Morgue Eroded Thoughts."
4,Dettinger/Oasis,"In my opinion, one of the best producers out there. Dettinger is a part of the Cologne Kompakt minimal tech/house scene but his work is more lush, subtle-- maybe more ""musical""-- than that of his peers. A very understated record, not too much in the way of beats and nothing really for the dancefloor, but captivating just the same. Some reference points would be Oval, the quieter Autechre tracks, and maybe ""Music for 18 Musicians."" Sort of. Early morning or late night. Try it, you'll like it."
2,maybe ok for smaller breeds,"Your dog needs to be ok with the sound of nail grinding or it won't work. I have medium sized breeds and I felt I could have used more power to effectively and in a timely manner, grind my dogs' nails. This is sitting in a drawer right now."
4,oster pet nail grinder,this works pretty well. takes a few minutes of getting used to it. also allow your pet a little time to get used to whats going on with it and the noise it makes. overall pretty good though
2,Band won't stay in place,"I received the trimmer the other day and found the instructions very lacking in information. When I barely touch my dog's toenail with the band the thing slides all over the place. The band seems tight until I try to trim my dog's nails. Of course, with no good instructions there isn't a way to find out how to correct this issue. Hopefully, someone out there that enjoys this tool can help answer this question."
2,not very good for larger dogs,Purchased it to replace clippers and so we don't have to take the dog to the groomers. It would take me all day to use this thing to completely trim his nails. I use the regular clippers first still and smooth out the nail with the grinder since its too late to send it back.
4,Very good Tool,"Although it does take some time for the dogs to get over the feeling of something drilling their nails ( freaks some out more than others) it sure beats the clippers. It is not as easy as they say and my preferred method is still to have it done when we visit the vet. (very easy, and not too pricey if your vet is ethical)"
4,nail grinder excellent alternative for nail cutters,"What a great piece of equipment. Our dog has long nails and hates having his nails cut. His nails are dark and it is difficult to see the quick. In the past when we have clipped his nails, the quick often was cut causing pain and bleeding. It was always a struggle to clip his nails. Now he just lays there and lets us file his nails. We do a little at a time and the quick is beginning to receed. Would definitely recommend!"
2,Poor Results at High Speeds,"This product works well at low speeds but when you use it on high speed and try to grind a dog's nails, it slows down considerably. Motor needs more torque! I returned this product and purchased a Dremel variable speed 35000RPM model that works great! Amazon is GREAT about processing returns and ensuring the customer is satisfied!"
3,Maybe skip it,"The diagram of the grinder did not show some of the parts, so I had to fool around with it to figure out how to lock the grinding stone in corectly. It does a good job grinding, but of course my dogs are sort of freaked out by it. They do not mind getting their nails done with a clipper, so I think I will clip them the regular way, and maybe just do a quick grind of the ends. If your dog hates to have his nails cut, this will probably make them panic."
1,never last,"I am a dog groomer and I have bought many of these grinders and they are awesome. But they never last, the chip board shorts out. Starting 4 years ago, the grinders used to last our whole salon months close to a year, but when they were remade they would last only a few weeks. But now they are so bad we bought one and used it TWICE and it never worked again. I will now only use the Andis brand. I have also had many clippers and had to send them back to be fixed and they sent me new ones that later broke in a month!"
4,Why did I waste money on all those other clippers before!?,"I have a 60lb pitbull with really thick, hard nails. Every time I would cut his nails with clippers, his nails would splinter, and somemes crack all the way up, which I know is painful. I just recently purchased this grinder. I went to the website dooberdawn.com, which has instructions on how to trim the nails, because that is important. Since my pit is a gentle giant, he let me trim his nails with no problem! IT REALLY WORKS! It just takes a little practice. I tried it on myself first to see exactly what too much pressure and what not enuff pressure feels like. Make sure u read the instructions on the website, because the instructions that come with it SUCK!"
4,Good product but case should be larger,"We use this nail trimmer for our Great Dane's nails. It does not have the power of the tool we'd had previously, but it is adequate and a good value for the price. But we've not been able to easily get the contents back into the case since the case is so small. Otherwise we like the tool and would recommend it."
5,Good Product,"This nail trimmer is very effective. Of particular value is the speed control which allows not only speed control, but noise control as well."
4,Oster Nail Grinder,"Wow, I will say this item does save money. Everytime I do my dogs' nails I think of how much I am saving by not going to the vet and paying $15 per dog.It's a corded drimmel, like my husband has in his workshop. But, I keep this one stored away and clean, so that I have it when I need it.It does take some practice to get the dogs used to the noise."
4,"Good tool, however you must work with your dog to get him/her use to the noise and feel.","The tool does exactly as it says. But you must work with your dog alot to get them use to the noise and feel of the grinder. I massaged my dog's feet everyday for a week before the oster arrrived. This helped for my dog to get use to my touch and the practice that I wasn't going to hurt him. Then once the oster arrived I massaged his feet with the oster OFF. Then for the following week I massaged his feet with the oster turned on at different levels, but I didn't groom his nails. Then finally about 2 weeks ago I was able to grind his nails with ease. Again, this is a great tool for grinding nails, however you have to work with your dog and have a great deal of patience."
2,Not enough power for big dogs.,"This should have said ""for small dogs"". I have an old english sheepdog mix and the grinder took so long to shorten his nails, my dog grew anxious and wouldn't let me at his feet. I tried to return the item, but never rec'd an answer from the seller to my e-mails. If you have a small dog, this would be great, but don't bother if you're a large dog owner."
3,Want to like it but still not sure,"I suppose if it spun any faster or if the grit was any more coarse I would burn thru my doxies toenails too fast, but using this will take a little longer than expected to get proficient. The long hair between her toes is tough to deal with, so am considering clipping it back before getting her way-long nails back under control. I won't return it, but it will take some practice before I'm pleased with the purchase. Not sure about how to change heads, or what they do: the directions are far too simplistic and not very instructional. But, it ain't rocket science, either. 3 trims at the fluff n'pup will pay for this tool, so I would recommend it. DOES beat the heck out of worrying that a nail clipper will go too close to the quick."
4,dog accessory,"If you work with your dogs and let them hear the grinder before using makes the task easier. This product will not do as good as your vet and it is not as fast as taking your pet to the vets, but for in between visits good product."
4,To grind or clip,"Product is fairly easy to use but should have better instructions ,i.e., when to properly use the attachments that are included"
5,Great piece of gear,"This item is used a *lot* at our veterinary practice!!And it is a favorite! This one was a replacement for one that still works but isshowing age. And after that much use, that is understandable.So now we have two and will not have to do without for even a few days. GOOD!"
2,Buy a Dremel instead,"I didn't like this ginder. After a few months, the dial that controls the rotation speed became loose and I had to tape it in place, which was annoying. I used this thing for grinding my dogs nails, and it is so horribly loud, it made my dogs very unhappy. After about 14 months it broke so I bought a Dremel 400, which is soooo much better. There are no attachments other than the grinding bands for the Oster, so if you buy a Dremel instead, you'll have a MUCH more useful tool, many times over. The Dremel 400 is also significantly quieter than the Oster, so my dogs are much happier now.Dremel 400-2/51 Variable Speed Rotary Tool Kit With 51 Accessories"
4,Works as designed,"Used it on my dog's tough nails for the first time. It worked fine, I love the variable speeds."
1,Who is Oster now?,"When I received the product, I was surprised there was a warning in the cord ( of all things!) stating the cord contained lead and you should wash your hands after use. Don't you think, after all these years, a cord could be made without lead. Big surprise! It's made in China. I sent it back. What a big disappointment. When I e-mailed Oster about my complaint, they e-mailed back telling me to contact someone else. What's in a name anymore when it comes to trust?!"
1,2nd Try with this Nail Grinder,"The first one I received didn't have constant power and the second one doesn't work at all, no power goes to it. This is a real pain to spend all this time trying to get a product that is obviously defective yet a second time."
3,Oster should do better,Was shocked after I got the Oster Nail Grinder has a tag on the power cord( contains lead wash hands after touching the power cord)?????What about the dog you are using it on the cord touches the dog? If you take it out of the case you will never get it back in have wondered how they got it into the case.Works well on my Doberman s nails wish they would have a cover for it for long haired dogs.
1,DOESN'T WORK!!,"Just got this and it doesn't work at all...will not even turn on!! Spent way too much time on this and Amazon is absolutely no help with the return or exchange! Was excited about getting this but now...I am NOT impressed! And the ""instruction manual"" is a piece of paper (only one small section in English) and is a JOKE!"
1,Go to Walmart for a grinder!,"I purchased this grinder through Amazon. I got it today and lo and behold, it didn't work at all! It won't even turn on! Of course I can't return it to Amazon because I opened the package of grinder heads to attach one...assuming it was going to turn on. So, I had to call Oster and now am having to deal with shipping it to them. So, not only did I have to pay the initial shipping to get the defective one from Amazon, I now have to pay to ship the defective one to Oster! If I knew this was going to be so much trouble, I would have gone to Walmart and purchased a regular dremel! At least if it didn't work I'd only have to take it down the road to return it! Save yourself the aggravation and money...go to Walmart!"
2,A bit disappointed,"Received this nail grinder and was immediately taken aback by how loud the thing was as was my dog. Oster's website describes this item as ""Super-Safe Operation: Whisper-quiet, low torque motor"". Now I can't say that this nail grinder isn't safe, and I can't tell you how well it works since my dog freaked out over the noise and I never got to try it, but it sure isn't ""Whisper Quiet"". If your dog is a bit skittish I would think twice about this one."
5,Great for the money,"My dog is scared stiff of it, but he has always hated anything or anyone touching his nails. For us it is a two person job, but the grider does the trick."
2,Grinder Review,"It works okay - not as good as I had hoped. The biggest problem is getting the grinder heads to stay stable - they are supposed to be secure, but tend to slide in further upon use."
4,A much happier dog,"this machine is much more powerful than the other kind i had. it means four paws get done in about the same time as two could be finished before. while it makes a little more noise than my other one, it spins much faster and pudgie tolerates it very well. she certainly prefers being done more quickly!"
2,Ok Product - My Dog Hates It!!!,"It's an ok product. When you apply a little more pressure it doesn't work. My dog is so afraid of this grinder, we never used it for the 2nd time. It's very noisy and gives off a vibration that scares my dog so much that he has to run and hide for hours. Not what I've expected to do."
3,Overated,"The up side to this device is that it is comfortable in terms of size, especially for a woman's hand. The downside is 3-fold, in my experience. It is under powered for use on large breed dogs, I own and show Akitas. It might be good for smaller dogs but not large working breeds. 2) the cord is excessively long and cumbersome being attached to a very large and clunky transformer. 3) the rheostat controlling the speed of the tool is very poorly located and you are continually altering the speed of the device because the lower portion of your hand comes in contact with the rheostat as you manipulate the position of the grinder. I have previously used a variable speed dremel tool and purchased this in an emergency. I will be going back to my dremel as soon as I get it back from the repair shop."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Reluctant attorney, Stewart Levine, provides a rational framework to justify spending his life avoiding conflict and confrontation. Even in the business world, he takes a pass on legal action and other logical ways of fighting back in a conflict. Instead, when opinions differ and arguments flourish, he seeks a higher course of reconciliation and collaboration. His seven-step resolution process saves time and money, launders egos, and advances clarity. Although each chapter is summed up almost too tidily in a final paragraph, or even a final sentence, Levine does not stint. In each chapter, he shares real world examples from his life and career. We at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone who wants to rationalize a business deal based solely on trust, to anyone searching for a deal-making scenario where lawyers are not invited, and to people who are looking for the words to express their desire to just get along."
4,Suwannee,possibly my favorite c.d. garcia and grisman make magic together. what's with the 'arabia' bashing? that song is mint! this album has the most gorgeous rendition of 'friend of the devil' i've ever heard. you won't be disappointed with this recording! a must have for jerry lovers and grisman lovers both. Check Grisman out at Suwanneeee
5,Extraordinary pickin,"This CD is a must-own, I just listened to it this morning. The acoustic jam ""Arabia"" is worth the price of the CD."
4,A very simple mini and waterproof !,"Product is very simple to operate, batteries not included, easy on/off of different heads, waterproof for shower tub play and simple to clean. Twisting dial controls, nice variety vibration, small size makes product easy for travel, great use on men and women! Rated only a four because am not sure waterproof would include tub play."
4,Pretty Bulky,"It's larger than I thought is was going to be. It's about as long as my palm, and it is pretty loud. I would not want to use it with anyone else in the house. As for vibration power, mid level range. It will get you were you need to go kinda thing. It says on the package that it should be used with a partner, which would explain the size and low strength of it. As for the 4 interchangeable soft silicone tips, they are silicone, but are not soft. Also you really can't tell the difference between two of them. It does have only one setting with is what is it is. I liked how it took an AA battery instead of watch batteries. I would say don't get it if noise bothers you, or this is your primary toy. It's a good toy for couples I would guess."
4,Good stuff,I won't complain about this product or what it can do! It's great for both of you or for some fun alone time!
1,cheap,"I was so disappointed when I got it, what I can say about it is "" Cheap"". only one level of powr, for sure is not waterproof, i think they send out the ones that were made in China."
2,Nooooooo.....,"I am so unhappy with this! It's so friggin loud. And WAY too strong. It's irritating to the touch. Might be better over the clothes. And no one can be home when you use it. The heads don't really change much of anything. It gets the job done, but I can only use it once in a while since it's so strong. *sigh* Not happy..."
1,Not worth the money because not waterproof,"The first two times used in the pool it worked fine. However, water got in the case and shorted out the system. Tried to open and let dry out but battery connection fell out. I could not get it back in, and the inside rusted anyway."
1,Disappointed,I took it out of the box and got so frustrated trying to put it together. I ended up dumping it in the trash. Back to my Lelo.
1,waste of money!!!,when i opened the package it looked used and worn out.. grossed me out kinda. the tips were scratched and turning yellow and package seemed already opened.. big waste of money
4,Fabulous,Shipped right on time & it works great. I didn't think that this little vibrator had soooo much power I <3 it!!!
2,noisy!,"I bought this because the reviews and product description said it was quiet and discreet, something that could be used anywhere. Since i have two kids who rarley give me any privacy or personal time i had been hoping to find something I could go into the bath room with or even use once the kids are asleep that would be quiet enough to go unnoticed, his thing is not it. Its very noisy and in a bathroom id be afraid everyone would hear what is going on. It is powerful and works quickly but since its too loud to be discreet it wont do me any good. If you are looking for something really quiet this isn't it, but if you are simply looking for compact and powerful you may be happy with it."
5,A good Vib,Very good Vib for the price. You get 4 removable head that come along with it. It also comes with a bag for storage. Very travel friendly. I just wish it had different speeds. I love it. It get the job done and then some.
3,Got tricked,"So, I orderded mine from Amazon via the vendor D.S.T. I don't know if it is this particular vendor or the product (doubt that), but about 3 weeks after purchasing, it started to slow down and speed up eratically, without warning. I thought, maybe the battery. Though, after 2 weeks it shouldn't have been. I replaced it anyway. It did speed up, but it wasn't as it should have been with a new battery (or like it was when I first bought it). Only used it a total of, say, 10 times. When it was working, it was fine. But, once it starting malfunctioning, it hasn't been right since. If it's the product, then don't buy it. If it's because it was purchased from another vendor and arrived in packaging much different than the Athena box displayed in the listing, then it's probably best to pay the additional money and buy it from Amazon directly."
2,Left Unsatisfied,"Okay, so based on the barrage of positive reviews i purchased this product, i mean, if so many people give it high ratings it must be good right?WRONG. I have had this product for probably a month or so and have yet to ""get off"" because of it. I basically bought this to travel with because of its size it is pretty discrete looking, unfortunately that's where the discretion ends. This is one NOISY TOY. I do not live alone and turned it on one night and had to turn it right back off. My other major issue with this is the vibrations, not very strong at all. Maybe because i am too used to the electric massagers but this does not make the grade AT ALL. Would not recommend this toy at all.SincerelyHighly Unsatisfied"
2,Not For Me,"When my other toy broke I wanted to explore other options because I was still new with ""toys"". Well this was no bueno for me. My last toy was Pipedream Products Beyond 2000 Ribbed Bullet, and that had more power than this itty bitty thing. If you like power and the ability to get that ""O"" well this may not be fore you unless you need little stimulation. For those who need a little kick in the **** you will not like this toy. I was very disappointed. Now it sits in my toybox collecting dust."
1,The tip rusted after one day!,"I didn't find this to be exciting at all and after I washed it the metal rusted within hours, so I can't use this again even if there is plastic covers that cover the metal."
1,Wish I could give it zero stars.,"This thing broke literally after 2 attempts of battery install. Once we got it going by holding it together, the strength was satisfactory...but that was rigging it to hold together."
3,Broken after about 3 months,"I LOVED this product. I'm sorry to say that mine broke after less than 3 months of use. The issue is the little flimsy metal plates that have to touch for it to vibrate, one of them broke and I had to throw the whole thing away :("
2,NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH.,"My main method of play is a personal mini massager...I'm lazy and it gets the job done.This one does not have the peak full-battery power that other ones do. I had a Hustler one for a long time, it worked well. A friend gave me a couple cheap white ones. One worked well, the other had a technical issue.I'm still looking for that perfect mini. I'm not looking too hard though."
3,Didn't get the response hoping for,"Added this to a another purchase for fun and free shipping. My wife likes the rabbit ears on her other toy. Thought maybe this could provide similar sensation. Nope. Only used once, seemed decent but not thrilled."
3,Berman Center Athena Waterproof Mini Massager,"I like the size of it but it is a little to strong, it would work a lot better if there was a speed control not just an on and off. still not a bad buy."
2,Hard to hide,"i bought it according to the reviews. and good and real sleepery , wont get sticky,,,but its too watery and the bottle is hard to hide................"
2,Not what expected,From the description this item is not what I expected to receive. I was disappointed when it arrived. I ended up ordering something else to replace it.
3,Good for the money,"This type of toy didn't do it for her, but it performed as promised. The metal connection plate in the battery chamber is very flimsy and comes loose, but for a cheap unit, this is good for a little fun until it falls apart. I'd recommend it if your girl likes this style of toy."
1,"Oh, you tempermental Berman's.","Got this in the mail, threw some batteries in it, and it worked for five minutes. Then randomly, it just stopped. I've tried changing the batteries, but it fails to create any vibration.But for those five minutes, it could have been better."
3,"Powerful,Noisy Gets the job done :-)","So powerful i could not put it directly on my clit in the beginning ;-) so i would only set it at an angle... anyways... it's definitely a toe curler...the cons are: noisy, gets warm/hot at the top where it touches your clit and it is FRAGILE... the wire strip for conductivity breaks with the slightest incorrect touch ....so if u are buying it... buy 3..."
2,blah,never realy use it its just little and does the trick but come apart easier i dont like the twist to turn on either but great for travel
2,not as good as I thought,"There were some very good reviews for this product and I have had a similar one in the past so I hoped it would have been better. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The massager from the first use cut on and off with any extra pressure placed on the head. Washing it became problematic as it leaked even when closed tightly. Not worth the hassle."
3,Tiny pleaser,"Typical of the mini-bullet style, the packaging is better than the performance. Little loud and can be too intense if you head to the ""goal line"" too soon."
1,used,The product came in a open box that was wrapped in black plastic. All the silicones were faded and looks used. I would not recommend it. Not safe.
1,not worth the money,I threw this item away after one use. I'm glad it didn't cost much. Skip buying this item and keep looking.
2,"Strong, but not smooth.","I think something put into the vagina should be clean and smooth. But I was wrong. It's sharp and may ham your sensitive part.It's cheap, but, it's not mean it can be bad.I'm thinking about another one..."
2,"It's okay, not the best. Just okay.","I got this with too high of expectations. It looks outdated and old. I love anything that vibrates but if im gonna be using something like that I would like it to look attractive in some way. Like I said, just looks outdated."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you are looking for a weak vibration, likened unto the soft purr of an electric alarm clock buzz, then this is for you."
4,Hits the right spot!,This product is amazing! The only complaint I have about it is that it is quite loud. Don't try and use if you are being discreet!
1,Received & Disappointed,I was very excited to receive this item because I had heard a lot of positive remarks about it. Unfortunately what I received is broken. I have tried the battery different ways and my fiance also tried to help me with it and we were unsuccessful. This item is not returnable to make sure you think twice if you are willing to put out the money for it & most likely receive a broken one like me. Very upset.
2,Too weak for my taste,"If it doesn't take much for you, this is a nice inexpensive product but I'm used to the eroscillator so I just can't get anything out of this mini massager."
4,Nice compact vib,"This toy offers moderate vibration and seems to last quite a while on one battery. I have two issues with this toy, the on/off switch should be redesigned so it's harder to open the battery compartment and it can be run long enough to overheat >.<"
4,"Great product, with only a couple issues","This product went above and beyond my expectations. The vibrating speed on it is just strong enough to not be too much for me. Make sure if you don't want to be heard to use it with some music playing, since the noise is a little loud until it is covered. The only complaint I really have is that a couple of the rubber heads are hard and uncomfortable. I was able to soak them in warm water and it softened them up to the point where it isn't uncomfortable to use. I wish they had recommended that when I bought it. Over-all though, this product has become one of my favorite toys. It gets me there quickly, and is easy to clean."
4,Powerful Little Massager,This item is a lot more powerful than I actually thought it would be. The design is more for two people pressed together than it is for just self stimulation. The shaft is short so you have to be able to reach the area you want to stimulate comfortably. I would recommend this product with the addedum that it's more partner friendly than solo use.
2,Loud & hard & LOUD(in the bedroom)...,"You cannot see the on/off switch wherein the cap will pop right off when twisting the top too far left to turn on/off. This is the downside along with the loud vibrating noise. I was a bit paranoid & tested whether anyone could hear the vibration outside of a closed door...no they cannot! It's a bit hard and much bigger than the advertised picture, check out the dimensions first. Otherwise,it feels alright and will get the job done. I can see it being used alone, but Not something to use with your partner all the time :-(."
2,"Cheap! Noisy, Yet powerful, Not for beginners","It was not fun for her. She has plenty of sensation, therefore this was quite strong and it would just hurt her. She did not like it for that reason. The material is very cheap, and is not quite at all."
1,ok,the others were much better and more powerful. did'nt really see the need for it. more of a novelty i guess
1,Broke after 3 months,It was a great product while it lasted but it broke 3 months after I bought it! I started to notice a burnt rubber kind of smell and it broke.So save your money if you want something that will last.
2,"Cheap price, Cheaply made, get what you pay for !!","I am starting to think a lot of people working advertising for a product write their own positive reviews to amp up buzz on their own product, to try to increase sales. So now i am going to put this companies marketing team on blast, THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN WORTH THE $7 I PAID FOR IT !!! For one this toy will not stay closed when you put the battery in, everytime you pick the vibrator up the battery casing opens up, also the vibrator advertises how quiet it is which is NOT TRUE THIS THING IS EXTREMELY LOUD, my suggestion is when it comes to sex toys do your research and DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY ON A GOOD TOY, YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID. Sex toys is a multi-billion dollar industry and with some companys outsourcing all their work to China the quality is cheap price for cheap toy. BASICALLY IT COMES DOWN TO YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. - David Oral Imel II."
5,Oh. My. Goodness.,"I was super spectacle when I opened this up - but OH MY does it work. It is a bit loud, however, so if you are trying to be super quite it isn't the greatest. I wouldn't say the noise is anything outrageous though."
5,Wow,"for such a small vibe, it works great. Have only used one attachment, and it is great for me. Anywhere."
4,Pretty good little toy,This thing feels pretty good. There is only one setting and it is very powerful. If you use it to long it can begin to desensitize you. It can feel really good though if used just right!
4,Awesome!,"I love this, though at first it was hard to put the battery in. The little metal piece popped right out, and I struggled to fix it for like 5 minutes. Then it worked out fine, and no problems since. I would have given a 5 star rating, if only the little metal piece didn't come out, I feel like that should have been at least glued in."
3,"Pretty good, but doesn't vibrate that hard",This was one of the first toys I bought for my g/f since she had never tried a toy before. She liked it a lot but prefers the pink wand I got for her:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ODQJX6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_6Even for just her clit. The problem with this one is that it just doesn't vibrate that hard. It's really nice though and for the price it's a great deal.
2,Just Eh,Not a powerful vibration at all. Also somewhat loud. I prefer a bullet over this. Definitely don't recommend this product.
2,Looks pre-owned,"I ordered this as my first vibrator and am rather surprised with what I got. The body of the massager is heavily scuffed and scratched and looks as though someone has been just chucking it around or something. The little toppers look old, dingy, and are incredibly scuffed all around. Overall, the item looks like it was someone's favorite toy versus a brand new product. I am not only sorely disappointed, but also a bit turned off from wanting to use it. I don't know if I'll purchase an item like this again off Amazon, let alone one of this particular brand."
3,I doesn't work anymore,"This Berman Center Athena Waterproof Mini Massager was OK, I am not too crazy, I worked fine the first 2 times I use it, then after the 3rd time it just stop working, for not apparent reason at all, I change the batteries, that didn't help, showed it to my fiance to see if he could fix it, and he just laugh at me and say that he will get me another one, he likes when we use toys together....Any ways this was a waste of money for me, :-(At least it was cheap :-)Berman Center Athena Waterproof Mini Massager"
4,Good for first timers.,"The Athena is my first vibrator, and it just arrived today. I really like it. It has a fairly powerful motor, and it did the job quickly. It also easy to turn off and on. I defiantely have a new friend!*I am in my 20s, however I wish to remain anonymous*"
3,"Eh, could have more power.","This is a nice little toy if you are using it with a partner. For a solo act it lacks enough power to really be of use. It works okay, but it isn't a ""big bang,"" if you know what I mean. It's worth it for the price, though."
1,Cheap Product,This product is poorly made and will not last. The metal connection piece broke the second time I used it. I could pay $10.00 and get a replacement but I know that will not last either. I am sorry I wasted my money on this.
3,Good enough,"Having a waterproof mini massager is kind of mandatory when you own more than a few toys. Small enough to be discreet and easily carried in even a pocket. It is powerful but almost too much. I have found that having only 1 speed just does not work for me. The different tops are not very good - they are a little too hard. Because they are so hard, they don't feel very different from each other. For what it is, it's ok, but if you are looking for one then I would not put this one at the top of any list."
1,Piece of Garbage,"This vibrator worked beautifully for three days. On the fourth day it wouldn't even turn on. I kept it stored in my bedside drawer. It didn't get wet, none of the components broke off, the batteries didn't explode. It was just lying on it's side, in my drawer, for a day. And now it doesn't work. I am extremely disappointed in this product and a refund is apparently not an option. We'll see about that."
4,An easy purchase,"The last one died but got a lot of use by my girlfriend over the past year. At the price, it is well worth it. It isn't quiet but not overly loud either. It's very strong and she was happy I got another one of these."
4,Good,I liked this product. It's small and does what I need it to. Only thing is its one speed and a lil noisey. Other wise it's a good product for what you pay for.
3,It's ok,This product got a lot of good reviews but I was a tad disappointed when it arrived. The vibrations feel strong holding the massager in your hand but when you touch it parts - like the back for instance - the vibrations don't feel as strong and the heads - the ones with the nubs - feel hard and stiff.
1,What a piece of junk...cheap for a reason,"I bought this product in October -It got to my apartment, I used it once, then washed it. This allegedly waterprood product has never worked since then. I have replaced the batteries and tried multiple times to try and turn it on but it just will not. Definitely not worth the money and shipping!"
4,Works Great,My girlfriend and I were looking for something fun to play with and we couldn't be happier with this product. It gets the job done and is discreet and quiet. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants something to spice up their sex life.
3,Cheap and you get what you pay for.....but it does the job,"It's a lot smaller than the package appears online. It's inexpensive. It does say it's waterproof but with the cheap construction of the product I'm not going to chance it. It works and aids when my boyfriend and I get it on, but the look of it, and feel with it makes me fear that if I use it too much, or the longer I have it, it will break."
1,Stick with Doc Johnson,"Strong vibrations, she enjoyed it. but after a week it would start anymore, changed battery, nothing.Tossed it in the trash and going back to the original rocket."
2,Cheap!,This was pretty good the first use but after that it broke down. After a few minutes of use it gets really hot and smells like something is burning! It is NOT waterproof because I can already see moisture gathering inside of it. I guess you get what you pay for...
3,Its ok,"Not a great massager, pretty short and small hard to turn on an off without opening the whole thing up, has good vibrations but would be nice if it had levels...just one"
3,Gets the job done I guess...,"This vibrator is alright.. It was my back up in case anything ever happened to my Good one, which ended up happening and slowly but surely this one gets the job done. I will say it's worth the money."
1,Did not work when I received it,This product did not work when I received it. Not good product representation. Very disappointed in product.
2,expected more,"I was slightly disappointed with this little guy. I ordered mine from amazon, and for one, it didn't come with the bag. That isn't really a big deal, but it was supposed to.Also, if you're an experienced vibrator user, this is definitely not the one to go for. If you're just starting out, its probably fine for a first user.It is small, and relatively quiet in comparison to others, however, the little tops it comes with are hard. More hard than usual, and aren't that pleasurable. It doesn't create much movement, and it has lower vibration speed than most. It also only has one speed. Its a better vibrator to use during intercourse, but not so great for solo play.Battery power is limited and runs out quickly. It is not nearly as waterproof as the packaging entails, and really doesn't work well for me in general. For a cheap vibrator though its alright, especially if you haven't used one before."
3,"Exactly what was expected, nothing special.",The 4 caps don't seem to make a difference. The one speed is a little too much. Otherwise does exactly what you think it will.
4,Wow!,I was not sure what to think of this product when I saw it. It was rather inexpensive. Thought I would try it just because of the price. It works wonderfully! Only issue I have with it is the battery housing pops out of place too frequently. Have to micro-inch the housing back into place to get it to work sometimes.
2,Boilerplate soap opera,"Loving You feels like a boilerplate Korean romance drama. A guy (portrayed by Park Yong Ha) falls in love with a girl (portrayed by the lovely ""Eugene""), but there are circumstances the couple must overcome to be together. The story and acting are not bad, but not compelling or distinct. This drama starts with several interesting premises, but the main thread -- that of the romance between the two main characters -- ends timidly. As a result, Loving You is something to watch if you have some idle time, but is ultimately a forgettable experience."
5,Only Mac and Cheese my kids will eat!,"and it IS good. even i like it and my husband does, too. We've gotten the Annie's brand and they refuse to eat it."
5,Everyone loves a Winner,"""Everyone loves a Winner"" - This book will go a long way in making you one and helping you win the job you've been searching for. Hiring great salespeople is hard work. Hiring the ""right"" great salesperson is even harder. You'd be surprised how many salespeople can't prepare themselves for the most important sale of all...their interview. Guerilla Marketing for Job Hunters is the New ""New Testament"" You can't possibly go wrong investing the time to read and apply the concepts in this book.- Rudy Richman, VP Sales - Protus IP Solutions"
4,Think outside the box - the lesson to be learned,To some extent the issues that you expose in your book are not simple stories for job seekers.What compels me about your book is actually a simple notion.If you want something you can get it by being creative.Larger results are achieved by not doing what is normal.They are achieved by breaking out of the box and doing something in a manner that is non linear.
5,A must have for anyone looking for a job in today's marketplace,"I found GUERILLA MARKETING FOR JOB HUNTERS to be absolutely invaluable during my recent job search. By following your non-traditional advice, on resume writing which got my resume noticed by more employers, face to face interviewing which increased my confidence and networking tactics I was able to target and land the job of my dreams with an outstanding technical company. Although the job I was interviewing for was a technical job, I faced few technical questions. Most of them were behavioral questions, exactly the types your book prepared me for. Thank you, this book is a must have for anyone looking for a job in today's marketplace."
4,A Good Read for Unconventional Tips,"I have read the 'Rites of Passage' by John Lucht, and this book compares favorably.The author has reaffirmed my faith in online networking, and the power of the Web for searching hidden jobs.The unconventional tips seem workable, and anecdotes given in 'The War Room' are bold attempts, and stress on having an aggessive attitude to get the job you want."
4,Great book,"This book contains practical, commonsense tips that are easy to implement and definitely increase your chances of landing a new job."
4,Great tips for finding a job,"This book has some wonderful, and unconventional, tips for finding a job. But unconventional is good, right? I would say so, especially today when the job market and the economy are horrendous. What you need is a way to ""step out"" from the mass of job hunters and be NOTICED, and this book shows you how to do that.[...]"
4,Manufacturing Jobs,"Nice book and definitely a great read in this current economy. Even though a lot of manufacturing is done overseas, especially in China, there are many, many manufacturing jobs available here in the USA. A great website I use to look for these jobs are at http://www.ManufacturingCrossing.com. The main reason is because they have way more manufacturing jobs than anyone else like monster or careerbuilder. Another great reason is all their jobs are directly from the employer's websites so you know the job your looking at is available directly from the company's website. Read this book to get the tips on how to land the job and check out online resources such as ManufacturingCrossing.com to help find the jobs."
5,"""If you want to learn how to land the job---read this book!""","The 'secrets' to getting that new job or opportunity are here in this book, simply written and user-friendly. Don't read this book unless you are ready to transform your life! David Perry's system works like a charm. You'll never have to play the game of resume roulette ever again."
2,Book is okay but online resources helpful.,"You might be able to read this book and gain tips but you need to be able to find jobs that are readily being offered to you. Personally, I like using [...] to find jobs. It has jobs only from employer websites and far more jobs than you will find on other job boards."
5,One of the best life decisions I have made!,"I was struggling as a missionary, in sales, and socially as a young teenager. I read many books to try and help, but all of them were to complicated or only talked about WHAT I should do, not HOW I should do it. This book taught me HOW and WHY! That was ten years ago. I am a different person now, I don't struggle at work, ecclesiastically, or personally. I now buy these books in lots and give them out to all my employees and friends.Other life changing books:1. Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey2. The Book of Mormon"
3,"Incredible song, but not worth buying both CDs.","""Blue Skies"" is just another beautiful, haunting orgasmic Tori song to me, I don't know who Brian Tanner is, nor do I really care. I'm just a Tori collector.If you're like me, buy either part 1 or Part 2. They're both equally euphoric, but Blue Skies is the only song . Unless your into mixing (is that even the term?) the price is, in my opinion, too steep to purchase both. I only listen the original version (which is on both C.D.'s) and I wish someone had given me this advice before I spent close to thirty bucks! It would have left me money to buy more Tori singles. :)"
4,An overall good book for beginning logic students,"Although the language was difficult in some places, I felt this book was a good introduction into digital design. It covered a broad range of digital components from gates, to decoders, etc. The problems at the end of each chapter provided an excellent way to practice the material in the chapter, and previous chapters."
2,A very outdated book,"Do yourself a favor and dont buy this one...The book defines some parameters for positive logic and for polish logic , the main problem is that it mixes both concept and you dont know what to do in some problems. One of our mentors tried to use it and we even have to buy another book to be able to do it to end of the term....Dont buy this thing"
1,Full of wordy discussions and spaguetti logic,"The book is difficult to understand and not recommended for the self-study person. A professor used it at college and the results were disappointing, most people didnt understand it. Do yourself a favor and dont waster your money with this book, full of mixed and outdated logic"
5,the abc movie of the week companion,"such a lovely read down memory lane. mr. karol certainly has a firm grasp on the spirit of this tv genre. anyone who watched these films will find themselves smiling broadly as they recognize each ""classic"" film from this era. and mr. karol's writing style is equally entertaining."
4,I wanna see these movies again!,"This book brought back so many memories. It's a shame that most of these movies are not available at the moment. I would love to see either a DVD release or a cable network rerun them as a series. My only complaint with the book is that it was too short. I'd have liked a bit more detail, some stills, and more of the films included. But all in all it was a great memory inducing read!"
4,Gift Book Review,I got this book as a Christmas present for my son.He thought it was great and could not believe I foundsomething like that. It was on Amazon's recommendation.
1,awful awful book,the entries are like something you would read out of tv guide which i suspect is what this author copied from. truly awful and an utter waist...
5,Oh the Memories!,"Being the rabid TV Movie nut I am, this book is a godsend. A short, concise guide to some of my favorite titles from that golden era of TVMs, ""The ABC Movie of the Week Companion"" also includes some interesting facts about the program, like salaries and ratings, as well as a fun introduction by the lovely Denise Nickerson (who DIDN'T have a crush on Scott Jacoby in the 70s?!?). And I thought I was the only one who remembered ""Isn't It Shocking?""!!! A must for nostalgia buffs..."
4,Comprehensive Lou Reed,"This was my introduction to Lou Reed and the compilation is very well done. It hits all the classics and is one of the few Lou Reed compilations to have ""Street Hassle,"" ""No Money Down,"" and ""Romeo Had Juliette"" However, it does skip the #1 alternative track ""What's Good"" as almost all Lou Reed compilations do. Also, I was expecting the live tracks to be taken from the Rock N Roll Animal disc but they unfortunately are NOT. They must be from a recent Australian tour. While they're very good, I wanted the classic live tracks"
2,Recipe changed for the worse; not as advertised,"I used to love these crackers. They were a staple item. A few months ago Sesmark changed the recipe and added flax seeds. I like flax seeds as a rule, but the new crackers taste very different - very bland with little sesame flavor. Big mistake Sesmark. Bring back the original! Since I couldn't find the originals on the store shelves (or private labeled at Trader Joes) I turned to the Web in desperation. My pleasure at finding them on Amazon (which I didn't even know sold groceries) and at a great price with auto-shipping lasted only as long as it took for the first shipment to arrive. It was a case (dozen boxes) of the new recipe. Argh! Amazon doesn't take groceries back so I didn't bother fighting them. They do need to update the listing though."
5,My Favorite Cracker,"I love these crackers. They are perfect with a goat cheese spread, and I eat them for lunch all the time. My kids love them too, and I pack them in their lunch. I am very happy they added the flax seeds to the recipe. I love the taste, and I am always looking for ways to incorporate flax seeds into my diet."
1,Huge purchase mistake,"I ordered these by mistake, thinking I got the Sesame Rice Thins, and was surprised of my error when they arrived. I kept them, thinking that they looked healthy enough and would make a great ""different"" cracker to serve, even though they had a wheat ingredient. I liked them. However, NO ONE IN MY FAMILY would eat them when I put them out, and said they tasted like cardboard. I have a full case now, which will be ""my crackers only"" for probably the next two years--unless I find another ""health"" nut that will join me in eating them! I should have returned them before opening the first item in the case! I learned my lesson, and will double and triple check that I am ordering the right product before pushing the order button again."
4,Half Cracked,It would be nice if these crackers were (subjunctive=contrary to fact) adequately packed -cushioned- so that there would not be so many bits & pieces.
2,"Very purple, not very ""new"" looking","So, I got these cables assuming they were ""new."" Well, they very well may be, but apparently because of the bulk packaging (they arrive with rubber bands on them), they get all kinds of dirt and abrasions from the way they are shipped to the seller. I almost returned these thinking they were used, but the seller provided a photo verifying how they receive them (in a big bag all lumped together).Also of note, the color of the cables is very ""purple."" Not the light gray/purple of the original controller, but more of a dark gray/purple that is clearly after market. I wouldn't say the fit is the best, either.Anyway, I decided to keep mine for my ""old"" controllers, but anyone looking for a new-looking, OEM-looking extension should look elsewhere. I am."
5,Best Dreamcast Extension Cable.,"There's not much to say, it's the best Extension Cable for the Dreamcast you will find anywhere. The most important part of this cable is the connectors, when you plug in your original remotes cable to this extension cable, it makes a click sound which tells you it has a solid connection.There's other Extension Cables on line for the Dreamcast that don't even let you move around or it will disconnect by itself because they don't have good snug fits.Madness Extension Cable is by far the best I've tested Period..."
3,Not perfect,"The part that goes into the PDA is not an exact fit, and everytime I use it, I hear a strange scraping sound... maybe I should stop using it? In any case, when its pluggged in, sometimes it charges, but other times its as though the power its sending is too intermittent for my PDA to actually charge. I disconnect and reconnect and its also hit or miss.In all, not thrilled about this product, but at least I can get it to work. Last charger I had did not work at all!Have not seen any other products that can accomplish this on the market, so if you're desperate, you can always try it."
4,It was good but not great,"The Jetsons movie had too much music from Tiffany (Judy Jetson) and is missing Coswell Cog's sprockets, Henry Orbit, Rudy the computer, and a lot of comedy. But other wise it was good."
2,Cheeeeeezy!!!!,"This is a good movie for the under 7 set. Otherwise, it is very cliche and very cheezy. Way over the top. The Jetsons growing up was funny. This movie was too much."
2,"Fun Movie, Disappointing DVD","I first saw Jetsons: The Movie when I was 12 years old and I loved the animation in it, which still stands up and looks great now, in 2009.As much as I liked the movie, though, I was very disappointed that this was a bare-bones disc. Yeah, it's great to have the movie in widescreen, but at the very least would it have hurt them to include the trailer?I also think, if the recorded material of Janet Waldo as Judy does indeed exist, an ""alternate audio cut"" should've been made available as a bonus feature. It's already odd enough to have a different Elroy; but knowing that a Janet Waldo Judy was a possibility, it's a shame to not have it.Then again, the price of the DVD is really low, so I guess we get what we paid for."
5,Great family viewing.,great movie loved it from start to finnish. Your whole family will enjoy it. The Jetson have always been a crowd pleaser.
3,Nostalgic:,"I remembered enjoying this with my children when it came out. It must not have enough oomph or CG for today's kids as I haven't been able to capture the imagination of my 4yr old grandson with this tale. It starts, he walks :-0"
5,Love the Jetsons! Enjoyed the DVD!,I like this movie! Good for the kids! And good for my nephews! That's that back in the days cartoons!Thanks Amazon!Dee SmallsDecatur GA!
5,Oldie but Goodie!!,This DVD was used for a friend's 50th Birthday basket. It was a hit from everyone. I was looking for cartoons from 1962 and found The Jetson's. We were remembering back when we watched it when we were little girls. Now she has the DVD to show her granddaughter. It came in excellent condition.
3,ITS OK,"NOT LIKE CARTOON SHOW, DRAGS ON TOO MUCH BUT GREAT FUTURE ITEMS WHICH SURPRISE YOU AS TO WHAT IS HERE TODAY AND WHAT COULD BE POSSIBLE TOMORROW. SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT SERIES. IT IS AMAZING TO WONDER HOW CARTOONIST COME UP WITH THESE IDEAS WHICH HELPED SHAPE OUR FUTURE FROM YEARS PAST."
2,"Disappointed, not much of Elroy and Astro","I did not like the movie as much as most of the cartoons, or Elroy Meets the Mob. Not enough Elroy and Astro, a lot of Judy and her friends."
1,Disappointing,"It's too bad the series wasn't available for Prime b/c this movie was a major disappointment. I hate it when you take a popular cartoon series of the 60's-70's, try to modernize it, and remove everything that made it great. This was the first exposure my 7- and 9-yr old kids had to the Jetson's and it barely generated a reaction from them. You can definitely tell it was made it 1990 with the bad music and cartoon graphics."
1,"If you're looking for a movie that resembles the TV show, your're out of luck","While the plot was a similar to the Jetsons TV show, something was lost in the transition from the small screen to the large screen. I gave up watching it after about 20 minutes."
3,An Interesting read that will keep you going,"Proof positive, again, that truth is stranger than fiction, The Illusionist is a fictionalized version of the murder of Brandon Teena in Falls City, Nebraska. It makes for a gripping (and at times gruesome read), but the story is true -- and the subject of the new documentary movie,""The Brandon Teena Story"", (produced and directed by Susan Muska and Greta Olafsdottir) and probably not coming to the neighborhood multiplex. The story is also proof (if incidents like the recent one in Jasper, Texas weren't enough), that sordid happenings occur in small town America just like in the big cities."
1,A depressing tale of doomed one-dimensional characters .,"The reader must check his brains at the door to stay with this one. From the main character being referred to as Dean, Deane and Duane to flies buzzing after a holiday blizzard there are problems with this tome. The characters are hard to picture much less sympathize with and the action drags to an inevitable climax but no real resolution. It is frustrating after investing the time to read this that it leaves me shaking my head in wonder that there is no real clear ending.It was like reading through smoked glass or maybe it was censored because something is definitely missing."
3,Pas mal mais...,On trouve aujourd'hui des cours PDF gratuits sur le web beaucoup plus détaillés et fouillés que ce livre si on cherche pendant 1 à 2 heures sur Google. A part quelques bonnes anecdotes citées dans le livre je n'en ai rien tiré d'intéressant que je n'avais pas déjà trouvé dans un PDF gratuit.
3,A Good Amount of Detail,"Another great book by this author. If this is your first but them all because you will really be pleased. They are just what I am looking for. Interesting and inventive stories and really grab your attention and move at a great pace. I really believed the hatred and pain the lead character was carrying around with him as he went on the hunt. The action was well written, not immature like so many of this type of book give you. You are really cheering this guy on."
1,Really disappointing performances,"This DVD featured the Native American kid Simon R. Baker, last scene in Once in a Blue Moon at age 10, where he showed exceptional promise. In Buckaroo he is 16 and all I can say is ""What happened?"" Not just to him but the entire cast! Every one of the actors sounded like they were reading their lines. I don't know if the story itself was any good because I ejected the disk and tossed it after suffering through truly awful acting for about a half hour. I just couldn't take it any more. Too bad. Could it have been produced so quickly and poorly that no time was allowed for rehearsal or even for the actors to read their scripts? That's the only explanation I can think of. This DVD would be excellent to use in acting classes as an example of how not to do it, but not for anything else."
3,Ok,"If you only have this book then it is great. If you have the first book, Toddlers Together, then it is overkill. Lots of activites are presented for different toddler ages and abilities. The activities range from simple to difficult as far as the materials the ""teacher"" has to put together."
4,Very fun!,My son is having a great time making tricks with his magic hat. We really like it and it's great to see how he enjoys having an audience. He looks like a real magician.
3,it's ok,"My son got this magic hat for Christmas, he likes it a lot and have been put on a lot of shows."
3,Magic Hat,"Bought this for my son as a Christmas present. I think he was more impressed with the tophat more then actually doing the tricks. A lot of magic tricks in the manual require items from home (ex: handkerchief, quarters....) so this isn't a complete magic kit. Though it seems briefly entertaining so far."
3,Liked it,"I liked it, bought it for my neice. It seemed a little cheap once she opened it, and it seemed like it would break. ALso, the tricks take some time to learn. But she enjoyed it, so it was a winner."
2,Cheap.,"I suppose the price isn't to bad for the quality, but that's not saying much. To ""pull a rabbit out of the hat"" apparantly you're supposed to put a small sticker into the hat and cover it up with your hand."
5,Beautiful!,This scoop is mirror bright and a good size for scooping ice to fill cups. Love it. A little pricey considering I don't use it much.
2,Did not fit my sega like it said it would!,it was not the right piece that i needed..did not fit my sega even though it said it would! i was disappointed!
1,Like one other person...,YOU SENT ME THE WRONG DAMN CORD!!!! I was hoping for something that actually went into my Super Nintendo's RF out port like it showed on the box on here but no I got a multi out port WHAT THE HELL I GOT THIS BECAUSE MY MULTI-OUT PORT IS SHOT
1,Waste of money,This RF switch barely works. Image on the screen is very fuzzy and it also makes the satellite feed running through the RF switch fuzzy as well. I regret this purchase.
1,Crap,"I purchased this for an old sega genesis and it was broken on arrival. The TV out was loose in it's box, and there is no way to open it and fix it. Tried emailing the company, they replied with ""we will ship you a new one"". It's been almost 1 1/2 months; that's chill."
3,Heyit works,I got this switch as a replacement for my sega genesis. At first i was confused because it didnt look like my old one and there are no instructions. So i was using it the wrong way and the picture was really fuzzy. I fixed that and its better but its still a little fuzzy. Maybe the system is just too old. Im just happy it works.
2,Outdated Goverment stuff.,"It is what it is. Old goverment surplus, outdated, lacking in many ways. For the money, do yourself a favor and buySAS Survival Handbook, Revised Edition: For Any Climate, in Any SituationJohn 'Lofty' WisemanThis book is much better !"
4,Good book fore beginers,Loved it lots of basic infermation . Amazing for beginer woodsmen but for me it hade no impact on what i didnt alteady know i live in mississippi and always been an outdoors person and most of this is just natural to me but i still love the book.
5,Survival Manual,"What can I say? It is what it is. Dry reading for most, but does have some valuable information within it. Took all of about an hour to review it."
5,sparkles!,Product fits and works. installed on a 2003 suzuki 1200s. reduced starting troubles and definitely added some pep to the motor.
5,A Christmas gift,"We bought the book for a Christmas gift for the grandchildren.As soon as it arrived,my husband and I read the book.It was great and I know the children will enjoy it.We love Pugs and they have been in our family for many years.The illustrations are beautiful.What is there not to love?"
5,Pugs for Pug Lovers,"The sequel to Tao of the Pug! Again, great pug snapshots, and Wilson the Pug, *giggle* keep up the good work! :) I believe these are some of the greatest pug books I've ever read, or looked at, for that matter. If you love pugs, and boy do I do, then you should definately purchase this book!"
5,Nice collection,"My family loves Sponge Bob and one day I was looking for a DVD with 10 eposodes and found this great 100 episodes collection. It was a Christmas present for my kids and husband and every one loves it. It's easy to storage, it doesn't take much space. Great buy."
5,where are the next 100 episodes!,my grand daughter loves this collection-and it allows her to enjoy countless hours of watching one of her favorite cartoons.
4,Good set,"Been testing the set so far. one dvd only played two episodes, besides that good deal for the.price lets see what the rest do."
2,Doesn't look new,I ordered this product new. It looks old and used. It may be in the plastic covering but that's the only good thing about it. The edges are worn and the corners are bent. My mother ordered the same product and it came to her looking brand new like it should. Mine looks crappy...
2,used look,"I got this item in a good packaged condition and 3 days earlier then expected.When i opened the box, i realized already through the plastic foil that the spongebob dvd collection had a damaged look to it. Especially the edges of the box had a torn down appearance, almost like a ""used look"". The box should really be in better quality. I looked at each cd, and they were in good condition. No scratches or anything. But what upset me the most, was that every single cd case was damaged inside. I'm talking about the plastic button you have to press in order to take the cd out of the case. All of them were broken to a point, where the cd's dont have a hold, and they're basically lose in the case. I think the reason is that they choose a slim cd case for 2 disc's. That causes the failure.I'm a huge spongebob fan, and the episodes are funny. It's just sad that the whole pack comes in a poor quality."
4,14 DISCS?! 100 EPISODES?! MAMMA MIA!,"I am a big fan of SpongeBob and I was looking forward to some sort of release to commemorate the show's 10 year run, or first 100 episodes. But this is too much.WHAT THE HECK?! Ya got 14 discs, 100 eps, (207 segments) in a pack. That's gotta break some kinda record! I better start saving some money. This could be better then getting the season box sets. I wonder if they'll ever release the next 200 episodes in another 10 years.....to be continued................"
3,"Storys are funny,But hardware is a little bad",I won't say spongebob's story.These are fantastic.But DVD's hard covers are a little disappointing.fragible to children....I hope strong hard covers to protect lovable spongebob's dvd.
3,wait,"What do you think are the chances that there will be a 'Second Hundred Episodes' set of DVDs? My guess is slim to none. Consequently, to get the remaining episodes, you will have to re-buy the first 100 episodes. That is the problem with buying this set."
1,Damaged,The disc were damaged and the cases were too. I'll never buy this sponge bob set again. I would not recommened this to nobody.
5,cool purchase,"I love spongebob! our kids love it! we play the dvds at home, in the car and everywhere. we ask the kids,""what movief you want to watch?"" they always say,"" SPONGEBOB!"". the dvds came in very good condition and we recommend to everyone"
5,Great movie,SpongeBob SquarePants: The Firsst 100 Episodes provides hours of entertainment for children. It captures their interest for hours on end. The slim packaging is very convenient.
2,Poor Design,"Like others who reviewed this item, I have had a small dish slip out of the rack and break - due to its design. Also, I kept finding water next to the tray and discovered that it was collecting on the rolled lip on the bottom of the tray and spilling over. We corrected this by placing a board under the high side, creating more slope. This could be done by making the plastic feet on that end higher. The addition of verticle bars on the front of the rack would avoid small dishes slipping through. I'm surprised that Polder didn't think of these simple corrections."
1,rating Polder 6118-75 dish rack,This dish rack in not entirely stainless steel. The dish holder starts to rust after the first use. There is no telephone or email response from the manufacturer.
1,do not order this item,This item did not arrive for an entire month when I finally decided to cancel the order completely. definitely not worth the money.
3,A nice introductory book for young readers,"This is the sort of book that excites students and encourages them to dig deeper, great for engaging classroom discussions about civilizations of the past. The photo layout is excellent and the graphics, maps and models are wonderfully informative. The easy-to-read text is adequate for general overviews but has not been carefully edited - some glaring typos (like the ""3000 A.D."" Mesopotamia on page 11) make me doubt the accuracy of the reporting. That said, this reasonably-priced book is still an excellent choice for elementary and middle school libraries, and casual and beginning researchers will find this book scintillating and inspiring."
3,Reality doesn't look like pic,It's not sparkly at all and the band is very thin. It bends and I don't wear anymore. Put away for just special occasion. Not real happy.
3,Great Hardware Poor Software,"This machine does everything it claims to do. For that it should get 5 stars. However, the codes are of little use in this day and times of low fat and healthy diets. For instance, going to the poultry section and then to chicken, one is basicly limited to fried and roasted. While fast food are a way of life today it could be handled in an attachment. (who's going to take their scales to weigh a ""Big Mac""?) More emphasis should be on basic foods and basic preparations. For software it rates a 1 star."
5,Great product,I have this scale and can testify that it is wonderful. It works just as described giving you all the nutritional information you need for hundreds of food items. It's aesthetic and ergonomic features are a real plus.
5,Indispensable,I have used this every day for years.I may not make the best choices but at least now I am informed.
2,Not Enough Pat Martino !,"As a hardcore fan of Martinos brilliant single note improvisation - I found this CD... a bit odd. Here, Pat is merely in a supportive role, (typically not a bad thing)behind some pretty weak arrangements. The percussion and the feel of the ensemble is somewhat cool - but, it really straddles the line between luke warm and boring.In general, this CD sounds very hokey for something I would expect Pat to even participate in. Its a far,far cry from his recent CD, ""Live At Yoshi's"".If you are looking for tons of Martino blowing, as he so masterfully does - it is NOT on this CD."
2,SESMARK RICE CRACKERS,After opening the box it looking like it fell down a set of stairs. Most of the crackers in the packages were cracked and full of crumbs. My husband is gluten intolerant and he likes these crackers. I guess we won't be ordering them this way again. We are both very disappointed.
3,"The Best Cracker Made, but Change packing--tiny pieces ugly","I LOVE these crackers. They are great with everything. (Try them with a touch of pepper jelly and thin slice of Asiago) But when they come in tiny pieces, they are only good for soup! Whatever this new packaging is, it isn't working. My last order was ok. What's up? Who tests this packaging? Sending them back is a pain in the patoot!"
1,Unfair criticism: Beware of sensationalism,"My daughter has been suffering with anorexia and bulimia for years. I paid $40,000 out of pocket to what is considered to be ""one of the best in the U.S."" eating disorder recovery clinics. Sad to say they made a lot of mistakes. That was a year ago and now she is back to square one. I have read Peggy's book and know that she has many of the correct ideas for therapy, that are not always utilized at other clinics. I appreciate the courage she has shown in trying to help those with this unbelievably tough illness.I could easily write a book about the mistakes that the clinic made that my daughter went to, as could other parents. Bottom line, medicine and psychology still have a lot to learn in how eating disorders should be treated. I appreciate that there are alternatives for those that are seemingly impossible to treat."
5,Fallen Media Angel,"This book describes the uncritical acceptance by the leading US media of someone without even a basic undergraduate university degree and their elevatation of her to mythical stature, without questionning her methods or success rate. Sadly, the addage if it is too good to be true, it probably is applies. The most compeling part of the book is not the high flying TV personalities like Barbara Walters, Maury and Operah but the heart wrenching stories of the young women who went for a $1000/day therapy at Claude-Pierre's Montreux Clinic. Particularly disturbing is Peggy Claude-Pierre's misdiagnosis and mistreatment of a three year old child. This is a great book and deserves a read... It is only fitting that the author dedicated the book to the young women who died of their eating desorders, despite be treated by a media ""angel""."
1,People need to know the Truth,I knew employees from the clinic.The author speaks truth boldly..and extremely well documented.Good work.
1,A Persian's view:,Don't worry if thesepuffy confectionstastesaltierthan you might expect.Their sole link toHafezis through the run of histearsand a friend's betrayal.
5,Come dance by the grave of the Saint,Hafiz came into his spritual awakening by the grave of a saint. He leaves us another marker to stand vigil by and welcome the Angel Gabriel into our lives. Time spent with Hafiz is like a dance with the beloved in the fragrance of roses in the garden supreme. If you have a heart that sees do not miss this party and bring your cup for there is wine to spare.
5,A true elixir.,"There is tangible light in this book, so palatable I don't think I will ever know depression again. I would not have believed words could be so alive and charming, seductive for my welfare. I can't imagine any trooper not putting this book at the top of their Y2K survival list. And come the new millennium tattooing the word Hafiz everywhere.I am thinking about renting one of those old airplanes that sends news to us from the sky with a banner that reads: No one, I mean no one, makes love like Hafiz.Should I be more serious, okay. There is a rare medicine here that comes from a different reality; one more true than any world where so much suffering exists. If any part of you is aching - if your soul is thirsty - you got to read this wonderful stuff."
5,Magic,"The extraordinary wonder of this book is that someone who died 600 years ago may be the most alive person you ever meet, and someone easily capable of empowering your life as perhaps few teachers ever have. There is mega love and wisdom rising up from these fascinating poem fields."
1,An insult to Hafiz,"As a native speaker of Persian who can read Hafiz in the original, I feel it is my duty to say that this is an absolute insult to Hafiz. Mr. Ladinsky has no business translating Hafiz (if you can even call this garbage a translation of Hafiz!!). A high school kid who can read Hafiz would understand him far better than Mr. Ladinsky."
1,Ladinsky's Con,"Ladinsky's work has utterly no relationship to the text of Hafez's ghazals: his work is not translation, versioning nor rendering. It is an imaginative appreciation of Hafez via abracadabra! He and his publisher are shameless.Ladinsky's many defensive rationalizations to the contrary prove him to be incorrigibly anti-intellectual and narcissistic. One of my favorites is his assertion that no one really translates Hafez in any case because the text is so corrupt! (From an Amazon comment.)How so very fortunate we are to have Ladinsky's priceless gift to liberate Hafez from the shambles of a corrupt text he can not even read, so that we can be graced by his miraculous translations! Hubris does not ever, ever get any better than this!darvish khan"
1,A Joke?,"This book must be a joke as no one except an opportunist of the worst variety would dare to claim that their poetry is an authentic translation of the work of one of the worlds great poets. The author claims to be a translator - I suppose in the vein of Coleman Barks who also has no knowledge of Arabic languages - at least Bark's poetry is readable, this book is not.Save your money."
3,These are NOT TRANSLATIONS OF HAFIZ.,"This book was my first introduction to Hafiz. The poems in this book are all very beautiful. However, anyone picking it up, and anyone who is interested in Hafiz, should know that these are contemporary poems and are not genuine Hafiz poems. They are NOT translations of Hafiz poems. Ladinsky's poems are the ones most people in the West are likely to associate with the name Hafiz, and I guess that's good for Ladinsky, but many people have been upset by what he is doing. I encourage people to read the actual works of Hafiz."
1,Pseudo-Hafez or Hafez revisited,"This night I dreamt of Hafez -With a bundle of roses in his left,And a goblet of wine in his rightHe appeared, twinkering cajolingly,The roses' fragrance bewitching.O Hafez, I sighed,What became of your poems!This Ladinsky imposes on you,He sells his own versesAs yours - what can I do?Listen, he said, that poor chapCannot compose or translate one single verse,So I came into his dreams andAnd loosened his tongue, just as a gift. ButWithout my permission he callsHis verses translations of my own.Now, tell all truth-loving people:They are Ladinsky's and not mine!"
1,Invisible Dish Rack?,"This item is incorrectly described by Amazon -- there is NO dish rack included. This product is ONLY a stainless steel drainer/catcher, which is why it is so cheap compared with other stainless steel dish rack/drainer combos. Unfortunately, that's also why I ordered it, so now I must cough up more money for a SS dish rack -- argh!"
1,This CD is a worn out LP transfered to CD...,They took the audio from a worn out record and then tried to clean up it with digital noise suppression. It leaves the whole CD sounding murky and without any life whatsoever. It's unfortunate that all the intrusive noise reduction artifacts make this CD an unpleasant listen. It could've been a cool experience.I wonder what happened to the original tapes? Couldn't they even find a copy or safety somewhere? Unfortunate.
5,Required Reading,"Outstanding research by the author and as only could be expected from Dave Hunt. No opinion or supposition, just historical and documented facts. At the conclusion of a 5 month Sunday School class on Islam, I provided a copy of this book to each member of my class. Should be required reading in all public schools."
2,Flawed,"Many telling points, but the book is flawed. It is very repetitive and judging by the many misrepresentations of Catholicism in it, which the author could easily have checked, I am not sure how accurate the book is on Islam. I would imagine there is a more focused and objective book on the subject somewhere."
5,"An ""as-you-live"" thriller","Have you been confused about the endless turmoil in the Middle-East? Are you unaware of Islam and wonder what the Koran says? Are you clueless about Biblical prophecy regarding the ""end of the age"" and what lies just ahead? Are you baffled as to why young Muslins are murdering innocent people by voluntarily blowing themselves up? Are you unprepared for who and what is coming? In a rather easy-to-read but factually documented presentation, Dave Hunt clears the fog. Hold on - when the fog lifts, you may be shocked by what you see. Better to see it now.Note - this is not just a ""bad news"", scare your pants off, kind of tirade. This book will also tell you the ""good news""."
4,Judgement Day,"Thought provoking book, gives a clear insight into the Middle East crisis and why it has been unresolved for many,many years. Gives you a greater understanding of why the Arabs and Israelites continue to attack each other."
5,AAron at AshleyRiver EL,I love your book THE LAST AMERICAN RAINFOREST Because we love to make masks of the totem pole.
4,Spencer Ashley River El.,I liked it because she used lots of details.I like her because she is very funny.I hope she will come back to our school.
5,Taylor at Ashley River E.L,I liked it becuase it was a really great book.It had a lot of good drawings. And the Totem poles were cool.
2,Early Prince Growth,"In this album, Prince is just a band member. I am glad to own this purely from a collectors standpoint. However, I make it a point not to listen to it. It is merely Prince in the group with others that would otherwise not be noteworthy."
5,Fit Perfectly,I purchased this lens to replace mine after an accident. You can not tell the difference and it fit perfectly.
4,"Mecha Godzilla - 6"" figure",Was a great hit with my 5 year old. Santa went the extra distance in delivering a toy that is not in any stores. Product showed up on time.
4,Good but not enough,"I bought this CD since I read a revew which said it was a great vocal trance CD. In fact it has 6 songs which fit this properly, the 2 balads are ok two, but the rest sounds like cheap up tempo pop. Still 8 good songs makes it worth to buy it. Kate's yet far behind from artists like Lasgo or Ian Van Dahl"
5,Different and Stronger!!!,"It really strikes me how well Kate Ryan is in touch with her music. The title on her latest album, ""Stronger"" suggests just that. She has defitnitely matured on this album alot, even her voice is more powerful and stronger than before. Her previous album also had the perfect yet simple title, ""Different"", because unlike most dance artist, Kate also poured a little of her own influences in it with some ballads and such. This is definitely an artist willing to take risk and not make the same album twice. You can be sure to see Kate venture off into other styles of music in the near future. Maybe even her very own pop rock album which I am sure for Kate would be a dream come true. Any Kate Ryan album is a MUST HAVE!!!"
4,Kate Ryan is Amazing!,"I actually discovered Kate Ryan through an Amazon Reccomendation when I bought Cascada Remix album. I clicked on the link and knew right from the first beat I had to get this CD. Kate Ryan is amazing and does an incredible job with this album. I wish Kate Ryan was here in the US so I could get a chance to see her live, that would be awesome. I love the Europop sound, it is classy with just the right beat. I would highly reccomend this album!"
3,Belgian Dance,"There's a few catchy songs on this CD, most of it sounded fairly common, though. Then again, I live in western Europe so I hear this kind of music all the time.@ A. Huemer ""anime maniac"": She's not French, she's from Flemish Belgium (who just happens to sing in French). Her native language is Dutch (Flemish) and was born in Limburg (Flanders)."
1,Native language issues .....................,She hasn't learned to sing well in English. Pronunciation errors constantly interrupt the emotional flow of the songs. And production is not as good as her early hits.
1,Purely Awful,"I bought this based on rave reviews from others. This album is awful. I am hoping Ryan's other albums are better but since I've been burned on this one, I don't think I can try another. Can I have my money back?I too wish I could rate this zero stars.It's just awful music."
1,Misrepresented Quality,"Ordered this item based on Amazon's description as 18/10 quality Stainless Steel. The item that arrived was 18/0 stainless. Customer service said they would replace it with the advertised quality product. When it arrived, it was the same 18/0 product. I am cancelling this order."
5,Oneida Tuscany flatware is wonderful,"Our first set of flatware came with my husband when we got married, but since it was from his first marriage, he wanted rid of it. The set we purchased was nice. We used it about 35 years. I saw Oneida Tuscany flatware on Amazon and loved the design. When it arrived, I was very pleased with the design and quality. Probably will never have to replace this set. Thanks"
5,LOVE THIS SET!,I have not purchased new silverware in years and honestly wasn't sure what quality I needed to buy. I first looked at these a few months ago and loved the design but was a little skeptical because of a couple reviews about rusting. I personally have not had any problems with my set and wash them in the dishwasher frequently. I was very impressed by the weight and size of the pieces. I would definitely recommend to other!
4,Great Look,"Oneida Mooncrest 45-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 8The item arrived quickly and look great it fits the purpos I brought it for."
2,Rust spots,I bought a service set for 12 used here on Amazon. After 2 months I noticed this morning that rust spots have formed on the knives. It forms in the matte finish areas. I searched online and found that really you should buy 18/10 stainless flatware. Most flatware produced is not 18/10 anymore it is 18/0. I love the beauty and feel of these pieces but I do not want to have to clean rust off. Guess I'll have to buy something else. 18/10 is about twice as much as 18/0 but in my view its worth it.
1,Rusty,"We got these for our rental condo. When we visited, we were very disappointed to see that after only 4 months, there were rust spots on many of the pieces."
1,Look good but quality is not good,I just got this item 2 weeks ago and started to use them as day to day at home...the knives are starting to show corrosion spots over the shaded areas...it is not good signal after just 2 weeks of use...they say it is stainles steel...but I think quality is not good since I had other stainless steels products before from Oneida and they use to last forever...
5,Flatware is so exciting,I don't like to shop for crap like this but I didn't want something super cheap that I would hate later. For the price this is a great set. Feel very sturdy and I like the design too. The knifes are really sharp too!
1,Rusting After A Week??,We purchased this product and less than a week some of the pieces started to show rust or some other form or tarnishing. This was on pieces of silverware that hadn't even been used and started to show rust after only the initial washing after receiving them.
3,Oneida has disappointed,"I bought this set to replace my 20 year old Oneida silverware. They were very pretty at first but one year later, they look twice the age of the set that I gave away. So sad Oneida's quality has changed so drastically in 20 years."
5,Heavy Duty Flatware,"My husband bought me these on Christmas 2011, so I've had them for a year. I had read other's reviews about rusting, so I was worried about them, especially since we have a dishwasher.At first I noticed the quality. Never have I owned such heavy flatware! The quality is outstanding, they are truly heavy duty.We've been putting them in the dishwasher since we got them, and I haven't seen rust on them yet, *knocks on wood*. If I remember, I will update in another year."
1,"Rust spots, sharp edges","Yikes, what happened to the quality silverware that Oneida produced? I recently bought this flatware set and could not believe after three weeks it started showing small rust spots on the handle of the pieces. Additionally, there were sharp edges on the spoon and knife. I was accustomed to the quality of the Oneida silverware my mom used. Now I realize that their products are no longer made in the Oneida NY factory but rather imported from around the world wherever the labor costs are probably cheapest and without regard to quality control. This product is very disappointing and I wouldn't even consider ever purchasing any products imported by Oneida. - Deeply disappointed."
5,Beautiful flatware set,"This was a gift for my sister for use in their RV. She told me the set is so attractive, she's going to replace the set in her home and use her old flatware for camping."
4,Sturdy and whimsical,I have not seen any of the issues reported by others. Love this beautiful set and only held back a star due to open search for 18/10 brings up this set and it is indeed NOT 18/10. I am very satisfied non the less given the great price!
3,worthwhile reading,ive only read parts of the book and looked over several subjects covered in it -one trick works for me in the book is johns 14 bid ive tried this trick over and over and it works and nothing to lose last hand nils amazes me how offten it works -i feel its worth while reading -congrats on your first book continue on gigs
2,Not to Lose,"I'm no sure that ""not to lose"" is ""to win""... But until now I just had a look on the table of contents."
3,Not Bad,"This book was pretty good. I would really like to recommend it to players learning the fundamentals. Strichman has done a good job of presenting the elementary aspects of Spades. However, if you are experienced, you might be a bit disappointed. The advanced situations and topics never seem to be covered. Perhaps this was the author's intent. I did disagree with some points, but overall I thought the advice was pretty decent. I'm still waiting on a new Spades book for the advanced player!Good job Strichman!"
3,A decent Introduction,"This book offers a decent Introduction for the beginner. Unfortunately, if the beginner ever hopes to become an expert, this book does not give a good foundation.That being said, for those who simply want to become 'solid' players, this book is a good read. If you don't take Spades that seriously and are looking to get an edge on 90% of all Spades players, this book will do it. If you are hoping to one day be one of the elite, I recommend getting a more accurate and sophisticated foundation from one of the other books available on the market such as Fleishman's Spades for Winners and Master Spades."
5,A must read for all spades players,"I am an avid spades player. I figured reading this book would be good for pointers & reminders. But after reading the book I learned quite a bit more then I expected to. The author not only explains how to apply certain techniques, but explains why they work in a fun & interesting way. I would highly recommend this book to any spades player from novice to expert."
5,An Absolute Must!,"This book is an absolute ""must read"" for anyone who enjoys the game of spades and especially for those that take the game a bit more seriously and want to understand the thought process behind the game. Its amazing to learn what's really behind the game of spades, with some great humor thrown in. When you finish reading this book, you'll want to read it again, and then you'll want to refer to it again and again. ""How Not to Lose at Spades"" definitely makes playing spades a lot more interesting, challenging, rewarding and FUN!!"
4,Win More Often,"I bought this book a few months back. I love it. I have read it cover to cover and still reference it. John gives insights that will help a good player be a better spades player. Its appraoch not only tells how but tells why using a risk/reward system of decision making will help you and your partner become better players. It is very straight forward and uses common sense techniques to help protect your team against spades disaster. Its based on statistics and probability, but is so well written, the reader doesn't realize this. There is no doubt in my mind that the book has improved my game."
5,My cats love it,"Our five cats love this litter box. We have always had the typical litter box and it was never quite big enough. This thing is really, really big and our cats love it, they think I've remodeled their bathroom!"
5,The cats love it!,"I decided to get the Giant Litter Pan, because my two male cats seemed to like to play in their litter box. Who am I to stop them from having fun? I bought them this giant litter box, and they are happy cats."
4,My kitty loves the box,It is larger than any I have had before. But my excessively messy cat is still able to leave his marks around the area where I put the box. So I am giving it a 4.pax
5,Litter box,"Well, what can I say. My 17 lb. siamese fits in it fine and doesn't make a mess. I like it very much and think my cats prefer it to the smaller litter box that we had."
5,Best Multiple Cat litter Box Ever!!!,"I love this litterbox, it replaced 4 litter boxes in my house. Now I only have to clean out this litter box and 1 littermaid for 6 cats about twice a day. It holds so much litter at one time which means I don't have to have mutiple boxes of litter around the house. I don't have to refill it everyday because it is so deep and holds so much. The neat compartments hold litter scoop, litter deodorizer, and even a place to have a bag to hold the waste as you scoop."
4,Great Investment,"This litter box is amazing. I have an elderly cat who was having trouble keeping his waste inside of the box. I wasn't sure what I could do about the problem. I was cleaning his box more than twice per day and he was ruining my floor. I read a number of reviews on the Petmate and decided to give it a try. Finally, a bOx big enough for him to keep everything inside! I couldn't be happier. He gets in and out with ease he can dig until his heart is content. There is less spillage and tracking. The tracking has not completely ended mind you, but it has significantly decreased. The only thing I struggle with is moving the darn thing with litter in it. The unit is quite heavy so I suggest emptying it before picking it up or moving it. This box is well worth the price!"
3,Could have been great,I bought one of these a few years ago because I have two cats who sleep in the garage and wanted a large litter box for both of them to use. It would have been excellent except it has a curved side and those silly places to store whatever they intended them to store. The cats invariably miss the box just were the curved side is and often try to poop in the storage compartments. I wish I had just gotten a large storage box and cut a hole in the top.
3,It Broke After 2 Cleanings,"My Boyfriend was cleaning it out the liter pan and he always tapped the bottom to loosen the residue, and it shattered. Considering i just bought it, i was upset about it ""dying"" on us. I think if he was more careful it would be a better pan that or, make the plastic should be thicker. I also agree with some of the reviewers the extra two side compartments is kind of annoying. I could deal without that. But, all and all it was good while it lasted, but id didn't last as long as i wish i did."
3,When it says GIANT it means GIANT,"I bought this item in a rush after having brought back my cat from the city I used to live in to the city I had moved to, hence I didn't read the description that carefully. I was looking for a larger than normal litter box for my cat and this item had positive reviews. It looked ok in the image too. When it arrived I got a bad shock from its size. I would keep it except I don't think my cat will figure out what it is or be willing to climb up its side to do its business in there. Be careful of the dimensions when buying this item.Also not quite sure how much litter would be needed to fill such a box."
3,Own a mountain lion?,"If so, you may have found the appropriate litter box for your animal. By all means, read the dimensions before buying! This is the first item we have purchased that makes our large house look small. I'm sure in a household with more than 3 cats, this would be great, but multiple litter boxes may be more appropriate than this behemoth."
5,Sandbox for the Kitties,"I read all the great reviews on this litter box and I'm so happy I ordered a couple. They are such a great size for cats. Gives them room to turn around. And deep enough for them to dig without scattering the litter all over. I do have the litter scoop in the side compartment but like others remarked it would have even been better to have that area open as part of the litter box instead for even a bigger size. Instead of 3 regular size litter boxes for my 2 kitties, they have these 2 sandboxes. They both took to them right away."
3,2 1/2 years and that's enough of round corners,"Yes, I've owned this cat box since Nov 2008, and I'm finally throwing it out.Why? Because I'm sick and tired of the extra time required to clean the rounded corners, which seems to be my 3 cats favorite spot. Sure I could go buy a rounded scoop, but every scoop I've seen have slots that are much too wide and lets ""crumbs"" fall through. Also, I have no use for the 2 pockets. I do however use one for the scoop, but I'd rather the entire box have a smaller footprint.The best alternative litter box I found, is thePETCO Mega Rectangular Litter Box. It's large without the round corners and takes up less floor space - without having 2 pockets.On the plus side, and other than a cracked corner, the box held up well."
4,"Ah, Shakespeare..what more needs to be said?","Sure, the Unabridged William Shakespeare tends be a bit unwieldy, and the text a bit small, but I suppose it would be as it contains everything the playwright and poet has written.Having those two minor negatives in mind, this is still a very nice version to have sitting on your bookshelf. It has everything in one package and it's easy to pull down, flip to any page and start reading.A few excellent features of the this volume are the index of all the characters from every play, a full glossary of Elizabethan English, notes on plays and even the first line of every sonnet for easy reference.It's worth it to pick this one up and to enjoy at leisure."
5,Great Value,"This book was in excellent condition. As a theatre teacher who loves to buy this book for graduation presents, I would buy 10 copies from this seller if they had them!"
1,Completely incomplete,"It's amazing how 195 pages can contain information about all wild foods (of North America?) complete with descriptions and from field identification to its uses to the kitchen. Makes no mention of ethical harvesting (photos of ginseng and her stories of the market price of ginseng actually work against the spirit of wild foods) nor warnings of poisonous lookalikes (rendering the book dangerous). Never to be bought or caught holding a copy, so please be discreet if you want to find out for yourself in a library or bookstore."
1,"I wish I could rate it ""no stars.""","I wrote this review in an effort to be honest about the quality of the film, not to reflect on the makers of it. Also, it is not necessarily friendly for small children as there is a surprisingly bloody scene at the end.I rented this movie because I was looking for a clean movie. And while it fit the bill (very little language, no nudity), it was certainly not worth the .99 I rented it for. I don't want to seem harsh or rude, but if you are looking for a well-acted Christian movie, this is not what you want to go for. While there was Christianity in it, the acting, story-line and thematic elements were so poor that it left me thoroughly disappointed. I was confused by the ending and found myself embarrassed at the poor quality more than once.Probably not worth your time or money."
3,The Path Of The Wind,It was a very interesting and well done story until the end. I did not like the ending at all. It should have been more positive - and there was not enough explanation regarding the final happenigs.
1,lack essence,Didn't like the story. Or the subject matter. The story was blah and I couldn't get myself to like it.
2,Sad ending and slightly bent theology,Well acted overall but depressing and disappointing in some ways. Would not watch it again or buy it for someone.
4,CUTIE PATOOTIE,"My Friend Lucky is a cute book that enables children to learn about opposites. The author introduces his readers to a boy and his dog that he loves. In the book, Lucky (the dog) will do something, and another character will do the opposite. This is a great early learner book. Buy this book for your child and let Lucky be their friend too."
3,Heartbreakers,"The title is accurate - the heartbreak of a young man forced by his past and his need for money into the life of a male prostitute.It is, I think, too grisly, too mixed up with the young man's past. However, the Nicholas Darrow series deals with this kind of thing. In general the Starbridge series was far more preferred by me, being the intellectual, emotional and spritual progress and tribulation suffered by priests (which could be just as bloody, but with explanation of suffering of the protagonist). The blood, gore, and general horrendousness that this series indulges in makes this series inferior. The people do not understand in the slightest what is happening to them and they suffer just as much as the priests in the Starbridge series, but with less understanding.Linda Sheean"
5,Excellent!,"This novel is an amazing composite of excellent storytelling and Christian apologetics. But it is far from your typical watered down mushy ""Christianese"" novels. The rawness of the story may turn off some people, but it is not for titillation or perverse enjoyment. It is real life. And completely necessary to present the truth. I've read all of the Church of England books by Ms. Howatch and loved them all, but this one had the biggest emotional effect on me. The rescue and redemption of the main character had the strong ring of Truth about it. I highly recommend this entire series, starting with ""Glittering Images"". You have an amazing 9 books to devour and enjoy!"
2,A disappointed Howatch fan,"Susan Howatch is one of my favorite authors and I usually cannot stop when I start one of her books but this one was not in that category. I just could not work my way through the filth in the life and language of the main character, Gavin Blake, and had to stop a few chapters into the book. I kept thinking she would tone it down as I really wanted to finish it. I had such interest in the continuation of the characters from the previous book, ""The High Flyer"", which I enjoyed so much. I am very disappointed that Ms. Howatch felt she had to put so much filth into the book in order to create the character. I know she would have provided redemption at the end, as she always does. Too bad one has to wade through descriptive degradation and language to get there. I believe the character could have been created without making it so descriptive. She has certainly done so in some of her previous novels, though this character is probably the most degraded she has ever created."
4,A who's who in wrestling with [great] pictures,One of the best yearbooks I've ever read. Every major event from 2002 was covered. Even behind the scenes coverage at WWE. I look forward to next year's edition. The match pictures and Trish pictures were great.
5,MUST HAVE,"This book is unbelievable! When I first heard about it, I thought it would be [bad]. But when I got it, I was shocked! It is filled with everything you need to know about 2002 in the WWE. You have to look at the inside pages tp know what I am talking about. It shows everything from the incredible rise of Brock Lesnar, the amzing return and spectacular triumph of Triple H to the brand extension and the hottest divas!!! I think this book is a must have for any WWE fan."
5,makes me wanna wrassle,"Not that I'm a huge fan of sweaty men in tights, but Mr. McAvennie totally captures the essence of the ring. A truly worthwhile read for any wrestling fan, and a pleasant diversion for the casual observer. Bring on the smackdown!"
4,A Review from Jon Mark Ruthven's #1 Fan,"With all the hysteria and hype in the evangelical Christian world surrounding the end times, balanced biblical scholarship and research is greatly needed. This is precisely what Dr. Jon Mark Ruthven attempts to give in The Prophecy that is Shaping History. Ruthven's book examines the impact of Ezekiel 38 and 39 on American foreign policy and examines sociological and historical research in an attempt to identify Ezekiel's Rosh.Personally, I appreciate Dr. Ruthven's commitment to biblical scholarship and solid research methodologies. This book is a tremendous resource for those in the field desiring more information about the field of eschatology. Though according to Ruthven the prophecy in Ezekiel is shaping history, but this book had not significantly shaped the emphasis of my personal theology which includes the love of God, Spirit-led evangelization, discipleship, and relationship with God and fellowman."

5,An all-time classic,"Great folk music. Timeless. Protest songs that we could use now, but wouldn't be aired on most stations today!"
3,True Crime?,"This is an engaging story. Like most mafia based entertainment, it gets your attention and has some kind of strange ""tough-guy"" appeal. It does a good job of detailing Gotti's life and the organization of the Gambino family, which is really all I asked for from the book. It is not, however, particularly well written or convincing. It reads a lot like a 450 page New York Daily News police report, which is good in that it has the facts, but gets a little dry after a while. To spice things up, the authors obviously had to rely on a lot of heresay and innuendo to fill out the details they could not have possibly gotten first hand, which gives it a little bit of a false feeling. This is the best and most accurate source I have about the Cosa Nostra, however, so I think it valuable for that reason. If you are interested in the mafia or Gotti, this is a good book, but if you are not already interested in the subjects, this book certainly won't demonstrate their appeal."
3,The Rise and Fall of Gotti,"It's a shame the authors were biased and prejudiced against John from the start. Not a great read, but okay."
4,Good book,"I bought this book because I love reading True Crime books, and anything that has to do with the Mafia, I will read. Although I enjoyed the first half of the book, it seemed to get really confusing and kind of repitive. It didn't really talk to much about the Mafia as a whole, just about how Gotti was a publicity obsessor and everything basically had to be about him. I think there are better books out there to really get a better story, but to learn a little bit about what his life was like, you could get it within this book. I wouldn't rave and rant about it, but it's a good book none the less."
4,its good enough! capici!,"what are these people looking for? this was a good read, as good as any of the others, if not better. this book should at least average 4 stars. i'm not going to compromise my honest rating to make it so, but people should be more realistic. its a biography, not an autobiography; so of course its not gonna be as good as sammy bull's book or henry hill's. but gotti never sung like them so its up to other people to tell his story. this was an informative, entertaining book"
4,argh!,"I really like the costume but the experience was frustrating. I had contacted this company at least four times because part of the Red Riding Hood costume was missing (the hood). I emailed right away and was promised the other part, which they then said was lost in the mail. I had to contact them at least four times over two weeks to get the piece. Frustrating, but a cute costume."
2,Disappointed,This costume was way too small with no give to the fabric. I had to add side panels in order to pull this off in time for Halloween.
3,"Very nice costume, But way too big!",The costume is pretty cute but it does run very big! so order a size smaller. I am 5'3 and 115 lbs and I ordered a small and it fit me a about two sizes larger. I had to sew it all around the waist and the undergarments as well. The end result was acceptable and for the price I did not mind having to alter it.
3,I got what I needed out of it,It was in decent conditions. It was a bit dirty on the collar but It ended up getting destroyed anyway for my project.
1,Sizes are way off,I bought this for my other half to wear to a halloween party and it was huge as a size small?!
1,Does not look at all like the picture.,"I'm 130LB, and 5'6"" and I got a size small. It was huge, at least a large. The under skirt is too bulky and looks tacky. The only thing I liked was the cape. The dress looks cheap. Didn't even wear it."
3,Runs large in the waist and very short,I read other reviews and bought a small although I usually wear a medium. I could have purchased an xs. I ended up wearing a belt with it. Beware...if you are tall (as I am) it will be very short.
3,It's alright,"The fabric is pretty cheap looking and feeling. The cape is very cute though. The costume served its purpose at a reasonable price. The only real complaint is that when it arrived, it came with a funny smell that my 6 yr old daughter described as fishy. I washed it before wearing it...otherwise the smell was not tolerable at all."
3,Nice looking but...,"So I purchased this costume although have read previous reviews that it can run a little wide. I definitely agree with the running big part. Although it's marked as size small and I usually wear small, it is wide from the waist. But it surely can be fixed by wearing a belt on it or take it to a tailor and let it be adjusted.Other than that it is a cute little costume for Halloween or just some role play."
2,nice until i saw 2 rips,even though the item arrived on time it was torn and that is not good business on the fence wether i'll be ordering from this company again.
2,Fits Terribly,"Despite it being a small, the thing fit like a potato sack. A lot of adjustments had to be made to make it fit. Also the sellers wrote on the petty coat with highlighter, though it wasn't that noticeable it was still pretty annoying. Other than that, the costume turned out to be quite nice."
4,"Cute costume, Great price!","This costume is super cute! Just as everyone in the comments have been saying- IT DOES RUN BIG. I was skeptical but my mom insisted that I order a size smaller after I told her about the comments on here. I am always a size medium, wear a size 8 pant and I ended up ordering the size small- it fits perfect and is even roomy in the chest and waist area. PERFECT FIT! Also, I am 5'4 and the costume is long enough where I don't have to worry about wearing little shorts under the costume because it's length comes to the mid-thigh area. Don't be skeptical, order a size smaller!"
4,good for the price- but runs big!,"I bought two red riding hood costumes- and I am going to keep this one and send the other one back- it does run big though! I am 5'7"" and 130lbs, I would have gone with a medium, but looking at other reviews I got a small- it is still pretty loose around my mid-section and in the blouse- that being said for $25- I think its cute, it fits and it does the job. I even think this can double as an Octoberfest outfit! Oh, I will also probably buy a second petti coat or wear shorts under- but if you were shorter you wouldn't need to- I just don't want ot flash anyone."
3,meh its okay,"this outfit runs VERY large. buy one size smaller than you normally are. the quality is pretty cheap..but hey, it's a halloween costume!"
2,Dissapointed,I bought this costume and i was very happy with the fact that it arrived quickly. However i am a size 8 so i got the size 6-8..it was HUGE! it is so big that i cannot wear it at all. It seems like it is a size 12 although it is supposed to be a 6-8. I would not reccomend getting this costume if you are a size 6-8.The costume was nice though so if you are able to get the right size i think it would be fine.
1,you want the truth?!?...,"...this new zealand film sucks to the core! The worst and the most stupidiest horror I've ever seen. That is, if you can call this horror. Ooooooooooo....so not scary at all and full of lame, grade-z dialogues with plot so thin it makes me wonder why oh why Karl Urban(of Lord of the Rings,Chronicles of Riddick,Pathfinder fame) wanted to act in this mutated turkey.Avoid at all cost!!!"
3,You have to be a fan of Karl Urban,"This movie is the kind of D rated fare that you can't help but love. It's a horror film that is at times both intentionally and unintentionally funny. The biggest draw is Karl Urban, and if you're a fan, then it's definitely worth it."
2,DVD didn't work 2x settled for watching on Youtube,"I orderd this more or less as a ""research"" project for a book I'm writing. It wasn't until after I'd placed the order that I saw the feedback of bad DVDs- yup, happened to me too- TWICE. So I sent it back, got a refund and then managed to find it on Youtube for free and watched it. Satisfied my research requirement, fun movie, lots of blood and action."
1,Caution - Dud DVDs!,"This is a review of the DVD being offered, not the film itself, which is probably entertaining.I figured ordering this DVD was low risk, given the reasonable price and free shipping through Amazon. It was a dud, so I returned it and ordered another one. That was also a dud--the DVD menu came up, but the DVD was unreadable past that, on either of my two computers or a DVD player.C'mon, folks--how hard is it to burn a DVD? This the first commercial DVD I've ever ordered that had these kinds of problems. Or maybe it's...the DEMONS??"
1,It's not haunted it's cheap,"I gotta say that the seller tried to make me happy by replacing my original copy for free, they didn't ask for the old DVD back or to only pay for the shipping, they just said oops... let's try and fix that with another one. Nope, that one didn't work either it skipped and got pixelated as well. It was kind of a gag gift that failed but at 6 bucks... eh... I lost interest trying to resolve what ultimately should have been a refund. I don't blame the seller, or amazon more of the production company that put it out."
1,worse movie ever!!!,I'm only giving this movie 1 star because Karl Urban is hot. But please don't watch it because of that. Just buy a picture and save yourself from watching this wierd and wretched film. You should not buy this no matter how cheap you can get it.
5,Better and better!,"I should say that I'm a little (?) older than most readers, but just as captivated by this fabulous writer. I'm not in the target audience, being 58 years old, but I and my granddaughters (9&6) LOVED this book!The 3rd book in the series is the fattest one yet, maybe getting just a little too big for the younger reader... But anyone hooked on the previous two books will not care - they will only wish it were even longer!Read the prequel to learn more about Cloud Wolf.Paul Stewart's imagination is unleashed in this episode - there are more strange creatures, people and beasts than ever - and Chris Riddell's illustrations get better & better - I WISH I could draw like that!I can't wait for the next volume ..."
2,Do you enjoy videogames?,"Well then we have something in common! Do you like books laid out like a videogame, with little story and each chapter seeming like its a new level? Neither do I! This book is all about Twig trying to find his old crew. Each time he finds one, the level is over. It's laid out way to simply. However, there is a nice touch at the end where Twig reunites with his woodtroll family for a short period of time. It sucks overall though."
3,"Disappointing, But Nor Bad","I didn't like this next chapter of the Edge Chronicles as much as the previous two. I think the reason was, a new character is introduced, and his story is the focus of the book rather than our hero Twig. For me it would be like reading the first three Harry Potter books, and then the fourth book deals mainly with Ron.The action picks up right where the last ended and the beginning packs enough action to keep you turning the pages.Twig must now save the entire Edge from destruction from a Mother Storm that is headed on a collision course with Sanctaphrax. It was a fine book. I just felt a bit disappointed that Twig was mostly a background player in what I thought were his tales. Still it's worth reading if you've read the first two, and the illustrations are once again top notch."
5,Book 3 of the edge chronicles,"I have read all of the edge chronicles books and i love them all so much. But Midnight over Sanctaphax is definitly my favourite. It is full of perils and adventure. And now my favourite character-Twig-is the role model for young Cowlquape, and he is just awesome. I highly suggest this book to anybody looking for a fun read or a grand adventure."
4,An excellent book,"Midnight Over Sanctaphrax, by Paul Stewart, is an excellent book. Paul Stewart has published a few other books. Most of his other books are in this series, The Edge Chronicles. Although it has not won any awards, it is still an excellent book.This wonderful book takes place along the Edge, full of trolls, knob goblins, and regular humans too!There's also the mysterious Deepwoods. Twig, with the help of his friend Cowlquape, must venture along the Edge and find the rest of his crew so they can remind him what happened when his crew flew off the Edge on his sky ship. All Twig can remember is finding his father, but what did he say?This book has excellent detail and description. It's like a movie going on inside my head. It also has long and short sentences.Any one who likes adventure books would love this series. This book is incredble!"
5,Like it was made for me!,"I tried to read the edge chronicles when i was 12, but gave up very quick (partly because i started with the wrong book, oh well)But 2 weeks ago I borrowed the books at the library, and i am now Reading 'The last of the sky pirates'.Twig ( or Kvisth As he is named in Denmark) has been one of the characters i've feelt most symphaty for.A's Any other great Series i've read, i Will also read these is english, since small things are different when translated, for an example cowlquape is named 'Hector' in the Danish book.These books are masterpieces, and they have All the things I believe should be in a good book. I Cant explain ( i've already written way to much, hahha!!) you just have to see for yourself. I know This Might not Fall in everyones taste, but if it does, it's an experience!!The drawings are amazibg aswell, and i've been inspired to take up drawing AND wrighting again.Thank you Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell, how very cheesy it May Sound :D"
1,Don't waste your money...,"I bought this item for my son, for Christmas. Wanting to get him something that doesn't place him in front of the tv for hours and actually makes him become creative and think. It would have been a great idea....if it had ever worked. Elenco's customer service is a joke and now I have a box collecting dust in my son's closet."
1,Paslode angled cordless finish gun,"Gun did not work when first received. After rechecking battery, nail pack, fuel cell and checking for jamming object several times, it suddenly started working. After using almost 1/2 pack of nails, it stopped working again. After checking and rechecking everything I could think of several times, I could not get it to work again."
3,Garmin 530HCx / LI- ION BATT AND 5 W XMIT !!,"FYI .....Garmin is FAMOUSLY ""INFAMOUS"" for not including pertinent info in their literature....Therefore: be aware that the Rinos' WILL NOT TRANSMIT ON 5 WATTS UNLESS THE LITHIUM-ION BATTERY IS INSTALLED and you have the ""americas"" version. If you use the ALKALINE battery pack , the max transmit is 2 watts BY DEFAULT !!! I found this out after contacting Garmin support and that was their reply....YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE LI-ION BATTERY IN TO GET THE MAX 5 WATT TRANSMITTING POWER. their are 2 versions the ""canadian "" version and the ""americas"" version ..by canadaian law..they can only transmit on 2 watts max. other than that ..i have no complaints about the unit as yet."
5,"W Meyer, Chief Rescue Instructor",I have owned a number of GPS devices and used many more in my career as a rescue technician. I am extremely pleased with the 530Hcx. It surpasses my expectations. Easy to learn and use.
4,Rino 530,"Love the product. Was here very fast and was the best deal i could find anywhere by 20%. would give 4.5 stars if i could, the only complaint is that it i was not aware that you needed to purchase the mini SD card before you could download or save anything to the GPS. If there could be any improvement, perhaps a warning or note to the affect that the SD card is not included. Other than that I'm Verry happy. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Must Have for Hunting & Fishing,"Make sure you invest 3 to 4 solid hours to understand how to navigate all the features and capabilities, and you will be very happy with this device. Pretty much everything you need for hunting and fishing, especially if you're with other Garmin owners. The peer-to-peer location and communication is outstanding. The Topo map is essential for hunting. Good battery life (better than I expected). Best part: you can wander around aimlessly focusing on the hunt... no worries... the Garmin will lead you home!"
5,Best piece of equipment on the market,I have never used a GPS handheld two way radio this good.Instead of hooking it on my vest I stuck it in my pocket.While walking in the woods during hunting season and lost it.Once I had realized I was lost and went for it and notice it was gone and panic set in.I did have a cell phone. I called a hunting partner with another Garmin 520.He did a poll location on it and when he finally found mine it was sitting in water with only the antenna exposed the accuracy is fantastic. And very waterproof.Ken
3,Almost there,"This unit does a great job, except for one thing. The range is very poor. The feature set is amazing, and as long as you can ""reach"" each other, the radio and GPS features are really great, but how do they get away with advertising such great range when we can barely get 1.5 miles out of this thing? Even on the strong GMRS channels...the range is very weak. Everything this thing does is fantastic, but if you are in the woods, and have any trees, don't count on getting good range with them. I guess if you were in open fields...they would perform better, but who hunts in wide open fields?I even called Garmin...explaining our problem. They went over a few things with us to make sure we had thing set for optimal range (which we did) and then suggested that if they didn't work for us that we should return them.Too bad someone doesn't make radios like this with more power."
3,Rhino 530hcx,"I purchased two Garmin Rhino 530HCx units for hiking and hunting purposes. I then learned that I had to buy expensive additional topographic maps to meet my needs. The GPS functions are not very intuitive. After downloading my maps, I still cannot figure out how to display the maps on the units. The learning curve on these units is pretty steep."
5,Great Item,Small enough to fit comfortable in my jacket. Picks up the satellite signal even inside my four wheeler. Range on the radio is good and it's wonderful to be able to see where the other units are located.Nice GPS.
3,Poor Manual and Documentation,"I found it frustrating trying to figure out Garmin's brief descriptions of features in the manual that came with my Garmin 530HCx. There is no information on why you might want to use a feature or its advantages.Same again for the included Trip & Waypoint Manager and separetly purchased Topo USA 2008 PC software. There is no information that ties them together.As a Tech Pubs Manager, I think Garmin's documentation is third-rate."
1,Amazon will not ship this item to ALASKA!,I tried to order this item for the hunter in my family and the order would not go through. Even after a very lenghty phone chat with an employee they could not and would not tell me why this item could not be sent to Alaska. No way can one speak to a person with authority to find out why this item will not ship to Alaska. So Cabelas got my order processed with no issue what so ever and the item is now in my hands.I would say the employees in this situation could care less of customer service. It would be nice if this issue could be forwarded to corporate headquarters. I gave amazon a one star on this due to this issue.
2,Not received radio over 20 feet apart,"I bought 2 of the Rino 530 HCx for 2 weeks now. I'm not satisfy what I have so far. I tested both of them with 2 of my regular Cobra radio.*Unit 1 can transmit and receive radio from around 1 mile.*Unit 2 can not transmit radio farther than 20 feet away. I test this with my other regular Cobra radio and confirmed it.*Unit 2 does not receive any weather radio station at all.*The Map that come with unit is very poor, it only show the highway. You need to buy separate map in order to use the GPS.*Very complicated to use all of the features.I will continue test some more and post more of what I found."
2,ripped off,"The person who sold this product put a cell phone charger in the box, to make it look like it had a charger, so there was no way to charge the battery until i spent more money for a charger. i felt i paid top dollar for a used product that was never used(haha on me)Hopefully the battery will still charge so i dont have to spend more money on a new battery.We have friends with the units that love them thats why i wanted this product that is no longer available new.If i have to buy a new battery to, i will have spent as much money on the used unit as a new current model available now."
1,El baile de la Victoria,This book is totally covered by marks and writings by the previous owner. You should not sell books in these conditions. It really bothered me to read this book with these marks and writings.
3,mediocre,"it's not such a bad product for the price, but some of the attachments are utterly uselsess. the skin protector takes away most of the pain, but then it takes forever to get the hair out, and you definitely cannot get even a 1mm long hair. without the skin protector its more painful then waxing, but cleaner, so that's a plus. shaving attachment is actualy part of cutting attachment, and does close crop, rather then actual shave.All in all it does the job, but far from perfect one"
3,not really satisfied...,"this is supposed to grab even the tiniest hairs and it doesn't... i had to do my legs 4 times to get them almost hair free and then i still had to tweeze a few! my legs feel like they have razor stubble, if the hair comes back quickly, i am returning this for a full refund and i will purchase the epilady with the coils... the original one, i know that works!"
3,My American Epilator,"I brought my original epilator over from England so I could continue to have smooth legs whilst at University here in America. However it did not work properly so I began my search for a new one. Amazon.com was the second website I checked out and I immediately found the item I was looking for, the Panasonic 3-in-1 epilator. I ordered it on a Friday morning and received it the following Tuesday with no problems. I could even track my purchase to see when it was being dispatched and the predicted arrival date. It worked perfectly when it arrived and so thanks to Amazon's efficient service I once again can enjoy having smooth silky legs! Great Service!"
2,Epilator,"I bought this to use on my face then discovered it won't work for that. I was/am disappointed. If it said anything when I was preparing to purchase it, I didn't see it."
3,good buy,definitely a good one.. works good and smooth.. shaver is nt very strong.. i bought 4 more of these :)

1,Not Pleased,"This may be a good book to use in the classroom but it was very frustrating to use for self-teaching. I checked this book out from the college library along with the CD for the sole purpose of learning Access. The CD was ""read-only"" and did not allow me to make the changes that the book directed me to perform. In other instances, steps were left out. After working through the first 2 units of the 6-unit Section for Access, I gave up. I have successfully used SAMS Teach Yourself for Windows and I think I will try SAMS for Access."
2,Good information that could have been presented better.,"If you are quite experienced in statistics and planned experimentation, then it would be O.K. as refresher material. The language is a little difficult to follow. I'm still looking for a more simplistic reader friendly book on this subject."
5,An accessible and charming ethnographic overview,"This is a must-have book if you're curious about how women in non Western countries experience pregnancy and childbirth. The book is charmingly illustrated and full of fascinating, reassuring, and inspiring anecdotes and facts about pregnancy and childbirth in other cultures and times. Essential reading for anyone questioning the overly clinical, flat-on-your-back, hooked-up-to-monitors North American method of childbirth as the only way to have baby."
5,Simply Awesome!!!,"This is hands down what Christian Metal is all about! The music wil blow your mind as it ranges from Judas Priest(Beyond The Mountain) to Slayer(The Flood) styles with even one of the most beautiful ballads ever created in ""Unfailing Love"" with a good mix of ""Jesus Praising"" and issue oriented lyrics. The production is very clear but not really in your face sonically nor is it too low or muddied up like the majority of Christian metal releases either. Rey Parra truely sings his heart out on this one and doesn't sound forced unlike later releases. I would say more but this album still leaves me speechless after all these years......Don't let this one slip away, get it while it's still availible as most Christian metal releases have a bad habit of disappearing into the great unkown after a limited pressing. Extremely Highly Recommended!!!!"
4,Works Like It Should,"Not a whole lot to say. It's a cable, the sole job of which is to transfer data. It does that. Ridiculously expensive for something that probably cost a relative pittance to manufacture, but at least it works."
3,Decent not great,The DVD is in Italian and is a montage of pele's plays beginning in 1958 through 1970 though it includes some shots of his play with The New York Cosmos in 1975. The real problem is that the DVD quality is really quite poor and incorrectly claims that there are English subtitles: It is Italian with Italian subtiles. Still it is a moderately enjoyable documentary for Pele fans and it does show some of his more memorable goals from unusual angles.
4,Best of Lee Oskar,"This album presents beautiful harmonica tunes not easily available today.I especially like the song ""Before the Rain"" which brings back fond memories of the 1980's"
2,Practical Guide to Natural Medicines is better!,"I'm a former practicing pharmacist, now a health promotion educator who must, for my lectures, keep up to date on the rapidly emerging information (peer reviewed research & commercial publications, internet, etc.) about medicinals, vitamins, minerals, supplements, herbs, natural remedies, etc. available to public with and without a prescription. My goal is to ferret out fact from fiction. I believe THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATION PRACTICAL GUIDE TO NATURAL MEDICINES is a MUCH BETTER (a FIVE star) resource--especially since it's a 1999 publication that cites sources including German monographs that are basis of PDR. The description of APA Guide, on Amazon.com, does not do this book justice. Once I got PRACTICAL GUIDE TO NATURAL MEDICINES I no longer used PDR."
1,I sent mine back!,"This ""PDR"" may excite a few biochemists and hard-core pharmacists, but it has little real clinical value for practicing physicians other than bibliographies for each item. See Practical Guide to Natural Medicines by the American Pharmaceutial Information. It is about half the price and far more clinically helpful."
3,"The Herbal PDR is a conservative, somewhat dated reference.","I'm not enthralled with it, but it is a decent materia medica with somewhat dated information. (The German Commission E was some time back.) It will doubtless be used by MDs as an authoritative source. Tends to be a bit conservative in application, warning against many good herbs which need to be used knowledgeably. The photos are all segregated from the text (like the drug pictures are in the normal PDR.) For general use, the illustrated Holistic Herbal by David Hoffman, Penelope Ody's Complete Medicinal Herbal and Andrew Chevallier's Encyclopedia of Medicinal Plants are better values. If you are a herbal practicioner who needs to interact with MDs, the Herbal PDR is useful."
1,Misleading Photographs and Typo-laden Bibliographies,"As a pharmacist specializing in traditional Japanese medicine, I am greatly disappointed with this title. Apparently, the parts of the plants featured in the photographs are arbitrarily chosen and have little relevance to the medicinal parts actually used (e.g. Asarum LEAVES featured in the photograph). And the bibliographies in some monographs contain typographical errors in the names of researchers and periodicals in Asia, which render the overall value of this title as a reference material highly questionable."
2,They failed to make this a practical guide for the USA.,"This book is a major disappointment.It's not that there isn't alot of information presented,but rather that the people at PDR took the simple way out and seem to have just literally translated the German version.The problem with that is seen when one tries to look at dosages and dosage forms.Instead of,for example,getting the most common preparations and practical doses for St.John's Wort or Kava Kava available in this country,you get a description of dosage forms not available in stores here.This is a major shortfall for physicians and patients actually trying to use herbals here.They missed a great oportunity."
3,Not as good as I assumed for a PDR,"Sure it has tons of info and it's a thick book from a respectable medical authority? but there is a lot of missing information, as well as info about herbs that aren't even used today!!! The herbs that are well known, and well studied, have good info though, but then again, they would have good info outside of this book. I wasn't that impressed, i guess. It wouldn't be my first reference, i suggest looking at in person first, especially if you're already an herbologist or herbal enthusiast....."
3,Not Bad,"This PDR is really good info for Herbals, but I was expecting some recent info on supplements as well. It seems there isnt really one reliable source for Herbals and Supplements, so be prepared to buy an additional book."
5,A thorough and useful reference,"The PDR for Herbal Medicines is an excellent, thorough and scientific resource that will prove invaluable to physicians, nurse practitioners, naturopaths and others who use botanicals in the clinical setting. Also important for physicians who want to make sure that patients self-medicating with herbs are doing so safely. The various indexes make it easy to access vital facts rapidly.Most likely, this text will not be as useful for lay herbalists, medical conspiracy theorists or New Age flakes who want information on the the ""spiritual properties"" of herbs."
2,Longevity is not its best quality,"While the content of the book is great (good reference guide), the materials its made out of are a joke. I buy books for life, this book will last a few years at best. Given its cost, I am considering returning it and finding a digital copy. I love to have quality hard copy books in my personal library, but this is made from some cardboardish material, and the pages are newsprint. The ink smears if your hands arent bone dry. THe pages tear VERY EASILY as you turn pages. The quality of production is very poor, and in no way justifies the price. FAIL."
4,a must have,I was a practicing acupuncture physician at the time and found it very useful. I think every Oriental Medicine practitioner would find it helpful.PDR for Herbs
5,very helpful and useful.,Very useful and complete. An application for smartphone or tablet would be helpful a lot specially for physicians like me.
5,PDR for Herbal Medicines,"The PDR for Herbal Medicine is a wonderful reference book for those familiar with herbal remedies, herbs, and herbal compounds. Those who are not familiar with these things will find the color photographs clear, concise and helpful. Cross referencing for common plant names that redirect a person to the scientific name for medicinal herbs is very helpful for those learning about herbal medicines.I would recommend a medical dictionary, like Tabors Medical Dictionary, available in pocket sized paperback, to be purchased with this PDR due to the fact that this book uses medical terms that may not be familiar to many.As a reference tool this is a fabulous book.PlantDoc"
3,A little book in anesthetics,"a little book to give you a general idea about anesthesiology. Discusses circuits, drugs, management in special situation. concluded by The history of Anesthesiology in few pages."
3,Naked Prey,"As a reader of the ""Prey"" series, I found this book to not be up to the usual caliber of the Prey books. The opening of the books leaves you with many unanswered questions that never get satisfactorily answered. Even though this is fiction, It is a stretch that that many murders could take place in such a small town. There are too many holes in this book. Lucas Davenport, the main character, seems to be tired and was lacking his usual zing and energy. Right now Lucas Davenport needs someone to bring him back to life and maybe his new character, Letty West, will just do that. I found it hard to believe that this new character is 12 years old. I would have found her more believable as a 14 year old. She did add some life though, to a lackluster effort. It was a disappointing read. Hopefully the next book in the series will be more thought out and have less holes in it."
3,interesting,this book was good but did not keep me on the edge of my seat.I was a little disappointed in the characters. There was not one I would like to remember for awhile much less for years.The subject matter regarding bringing drugs across the Canadian border and the Toyota dealing was quite interesting.
4,Pretty Good,This book was pretty good. It was predictable but good. There was plenty of suspense and character building. The book starts out with a bang. Two murders and lots of action. It leaves you wondering why. What did these two people do to deserve such a horrible and graphic death? You will have to read it to find out but I will say that the killer had his reasons for doing it and when you find out why you will wonder why he didn't do much worse. You really get attached to Letty a 12 year old girl. She is a tom-boy who has cared for her mother all these years. She is independent and has a real spitfire attitude. She makes a great character. She is funny and I really enjoyed her. Even though you see a lot of things coming it was a good read and Sandford did a great job on the plot.
4,Leave the smart-mouthed kids at home,"Being from Minnesota, Sanford's books have always been entertaining and this was one of his better efforts. However, I've tired of the trend to use world-wise children with alcoholic mothers as sympathetic characters. I also think it's time Sanford looked for a new editor, as his books inevitably have time-line and typographical problems and I find that mildly irritating. I was aware of reviews that complained of Davenport being ""too domesticated"" but didn't find that to be a distraction; I still love his interplay with his partner, Del. All in all, if you've always been a Prey fan, definitely go for it."
5,Sandford is AMAZING again!,"As an avid reader of John Sandford(I have read all of his), this is one of his finest yet! He manages to add even more character and insight to his ever evolving characters in the Lucas Davenport Mystery series. Just when you think you know most of everything about them, or even if you are a first time reader, Sandford builds strong emotions into the characters that make for superb, uninteruptible reading. I found Naked Prey to be more positive than some of his older works, which I thought was much better. I am already looking forward to the next!"
4,Another Great John Sandford book!,I love the Lucas Davenport series and Naked Prey was another awesome edition! I love the expected twists! I highly recommend it.
4,"Not bad, but still not believable...","While in the midst of this book, I spent a TON of time trying to figure out where in the heck Broderick was, I've driven to Fargo, I've driven up through ND into Winnipeg and for the life of me I could not figure out where this town was, even after looking at maps. As @derkrautboy always says, GFE. So, I googled, and lo-and-behold, Armstrong doesn't exist. Lety is an amazing child growing up in a rural community and Davenport and Del spend a lot of time confused in this fictious MN town. The kidnappings just don't make sense, the Canada drug running, the car refurbs, possibly, but the kidnappings are so far fetched that, again I have to say ludicrous.I gave the book four stars because Lety pulled the whole plot together and was very wise, as some 12 year olds are, she was a breath of fresh air and very true in character. I'd read it for the fun of it, but otherwise I'd pass on the Prey book, unless you want to see Davenport flounder."
5,More of the best from Sandford,"I own and have read every book in the ""Prey"" series and this one is as good or better than all that've come before it. Sandford has become my favorite author and I look forward to each new book. I got a little behind in my reading so I just read Chosen Prey, Mortal Prey and Hidden Prey, back-to-back-to-back, in a week. I've enjoyed the changes in Davenport's life, including job and spouse, and it serves to keep the series fresh. My only problem is, I'm getting into Camps head and some of the plots are getting too predictable. Still a great read and a very enjoyable writing style."
2,Our hero buys a firearm for a child. Some hero.,"My second Prey book and I don't know that I can finish it. While the banter between Lucas and Del is witty and the story moves along at a steady pace, I have a hard time with the kid not really being a kid. And Davenport buying her a firearm? No cop is going to buy a child a deadly weapon.I suspect Letty is going to end up the adopted daughter of Lucas, her gun supplier, and smarter than all the educated adults put together, solving crimes Lucas, the FBI, and CIA combined couldn't solve without the child's help. Someone, please, tell me I'm wrong. Until then, I'm going to put this book down and work backward from there."
2,Forgettable Entry in a Great Series,"I'm a huge fan of John Sandford's PREY series. The character of Lucas Davenport is a terrific protagonist and normally I thrill to his latest case involving some of the most interesting criminals in current fiction.Normally...Naked Prey however just isn't up to the high standards of other entries in the Prey series. The premise starts out nicely but then tends to meander. The antagonist(s) aren't as memorable as previous villains in the series. And, it seemed like it took Lucas far too long to get from Point A to Point Z...far too long. Naked Prey feels like a 200 page story that has been stretched needlessly into a 390 page book.Here's hoping Sandford and Davenport get back on track with the next entries in the series."
3,M.I.A. Prey,"The tough and dangerous Lucas we all loved in the earlier Prey books is still MIA.Every year we wait for him to return but now we only get the Beau Brummel, nearing retirement plain jane detective.Here Lucas just sloshes around in cars, hotels and cafes passing the time until the bad guy is caught. No real danger for Lucas and Lucas is only a threat to make an arrest.Fair police procedural but Lucas, we miss you and your hard hitting persona."
3,"This Book Needs to ""Prey"" for a Plot!","I have not read a Sandford/Davenport book in a number of years. My question: What happened to the fast-moving, nail-biting plots that I remember? Naked Prey opens with the lynching of a bi-racial couple. Lucas Davenport, as a special trouble shooter for the governor, is dispatched to delve into the situation. What unfolds is a plot in which we know the killer's identity half way into the book. The book regresses into chapters broken up into paragraghs of listless writing. I was disappointed and I hope that Sandford brings the old Lucas Davenport and his old writing savy along with him."
2,Hard to get through- didn't flow,didn't live up to the last books he's written. Fell asleep most of the time. Usually it's apage turner but thiss\ one wasn't. Waiting for the next one - maybe he'll get out of his slump.
1,A big disappointment,"Sandford mailed in this lackluster story. He stumbles and bumbles in the backwoods country, not even giving a thought to what may happen in response to his actions. Normally a master of the cunning psycho villain, Sandford's villain is too far from the action to be effective. Finally, the ending: pathetic melodrama. A waste of time."
5,Sandford Never Disappoints,"I have been a fan of the Prey series as long as they've been published. John Sandford is tops on my list of authors to read. In ""Naked Prey"" Lucas Davenport, married with a baby son, is now working for the governor as a troubleshooter. He is sent to a small Northern town in Minnesota after a black man and a white woman are found hanged in a field. The girl who found the two corpses, Letty West, is an independent, gusty character. She practically steals the book.Lucas has regained the edge he seemed to have lost and is back in action and fresher than ever. The character Letty West is appealing and adds a real zing to the story. This is one book that will not disappoint."
3,"Aw, man","Awe Jeez, I was hoping for more. Instead, John Sanford aw, mans us to the point of frustration. The only times the book comes alive is when Lucas is on his usual cross state, 95 mile an hour chases. Character developement (and paragraph developement) has become a lost art. Lucas has a son described as ""the kid"". Oh, that's real nice. The reader just gets tired of yet another murder greeted by ""Aw, man..."". Sanford just goes to this well too often leaving us with a vacous book that was too easy to turn the pages. And for all his skills as an officer, I found it curious that not only did Sanford have Del get shot (by a guy with 3 or 4 bullets in him at the time), but never knows about the real architect of the crime. Those are curious choices by an author who could have easily concluded this story in a more favorable way. Hey man, just write it differently to make more sense."
3,we need more,"Lucas Davenport returns to do what he does best: clean up potential crises for his political bosses.In the Naked Prey, he attempts to solve the murder of Jane Warr and Deon Carr, a couple who were found hanging on a tree. When the case is solved, the cops realize it's just the beginning, not the end.John Sandford does well to suprise us with the familiar i.e., the serial murders, the corrupt cop, the politician in damage control mode. Moreover, he gives us a satisfactory, though expected ending.Notwithstanding there is a lack of ingenuity which keeps this plot firmly on the ground. It seems Sandford has finally lost the ability to shock his readers.Naked Prey is still a good novel; which doesn't say much for a writer in Sandford's league."
4,Sandford does it again.,I actually wanted to give this book 4 and 1/2 stars. Although it is not his best all the twists and turns made it not only imminently readable but a lot of fun. Lucas Davenport has a whole bunch more left in him before his character loses any of it's charm.
4,Compelling Novel,"If your looking for a novel which is written in a poetic style this isn't it. It is, however, a well written, fast paced murder mystery which wastes no time. It brings you right into the story from the introduction. There is no wasting of your time by the author using useless descriptions and useless repetition. The book is poignant & very entertaining reading which you'll find difficult to put down. The book grips you right to the final page. Pick it up, you'll like it"
3,Not Bad....Not Great either,"When I first got it, I put it back in the sheath and the end of the sheath (the metal part) fell off. I put it back on and it appears as if it will stay on now. It feels cheap in your hands but looks pretty good from a distance. Overall it's not bad a tad bit smaller than I expected but that's fine. It's just mediocre, neither bad nor great. I am using it for a prop and it looks great so if your using it for show and stuff it's great for the price. It has a very nice look (based on the LOTR no doubt) and is a good piece just don't think you'll wage any wars with it obviously."
1,No more insight than what you find on TV,I have been reading bloomberg & forbes and I wanted something directed more at my personal life and financial situation. I thouhgt I would give money a try. Titles of the articles sounded good but their content was lanking. No depth and little real analysis. I will keep looking.
3,cancelled subscription,"I subscribed Kiplinger, SmartMoney and Money at the same time a few months back. Now I have cancelled SmartMoney and Money and keep Kiplinger. The problem with SmartMoney and Money was: they have way too many pages talking about picking stocks. These are worthless and useless. They are also full of other useless information. For example, SmartMoney has a ""Perfect Portfolio"" section in every issue. I just cannot understand what the difference in a 32-year-old should put 45% in Stocks while a 50-year-old should put 50% in stocks."
2,OK Magazine,"I had subscriptions to Money, Smart Money and Kiplinger's. All of them seem to have articles about the same topics each month. Money seemed more geared to the 30 something and younger age group so I dropped my sub and stuck with the others since they seemed to have a bit more ""meat""."
2,Monthly Financial Advice - Some Value To Beginners,"This magazine is of little value unless you are a beginner to investing. Monthly advice is almost worthless in an information age that is very fast moving. This magazine is dangerous if it leads one to believe that he/she can make decisions based on monthly advice. The magazine can, of course, be used in combination with other information sources. However, it is probably not needed. It is much better to read the WSJ daily."
2,Rarely useful,Lots of ads around. I rarely see useful articles that sucks.NO financial wealth as I thought. I Would not recommend it.
1,Money Magazine,"I am still waiting, more than a month after ordering, to receive my first issue of Money magazine, which I ordered from Amazon. This is the longest I have ever waited for a new subscription--hope they haven't forgotten me, as I was very promptly billed for this magazine."
2,Not Received,"I'm not sure I will purchase magazines again on Amazon. It's been over six weeks and I have yet to receive one issue of Money. If I had ordered it direct, magazines usually come faster."
1,No magazine,"I placed my order on 2/29 and read that the magazine woul darrive in April. After calling today to find out where the magazine is and after spending 20 minuted with 3 differrent departments, I was told that it would not be delivered until June. I cancelled my order, will buy this month's issue on the newstand and will subscribe to the magazine with someone else. This is the first and last time I will use Amazon for subscriptions."
2,Good for contrarinan stock picks,"Investing as more than a 'hobby' for 30 years - I learned decades ago, that if Money had a stock on it's cover, or had feature article recommending a stock or group of stocks, that I had one of the best sell signals availiable. An excellent source for identifying stocks at their peak.I used Money as an excellent place to get short ideas based on their recommendations. Surprised the Magazine still exists with the poor (and late) stock recommendations it consistently offers up. Perhaps much more than I use it for it's contrarian value."
3,Best for Beginners,"This is way too simplistic for anyone with any real finance/investing experience. If you have more than a few years of investing experience, you should probably look elsewhere, as there is likely little here that you do are not already aware of. For someone with little financial experience, this is a good way for you, as a casual investor, to understand the most basic mechanisms of investing and finance. The personal finance articles are hardly groundbreaking, but do give sound advice, whereas the investing ideas may give the casual investor just enough information to be detrimental to his/her portfolio."
3,A Personal Finance Magazine for the Masses,"There are only two personal finance magazines for the general public: MONEY and KIPLINGER'S PERSONAL FINANCE. The latter concentrates on investments and retirement planning. MONEY is ""all over the place."" It tries to cover everything concerning money: the best credit cards, personal family stories on their financial problems, the best places to retire, the best value in cars, and related subjects."
3,People Mag for money issues,"I find some of the articles inspirational in terms of changing my behavior to save money, but that and most of the articles are basic fluff pieces. Most of the tax and investment tips are self-explanatory and usually something I already know. If you're a moderately educated investor looking for a magazine to give you good investment tips and ideas, in my experience maybe 5% of the content fits the bill."
4,Money sub renewal,Was pleased that my magazine renewal went through so quickly. Money magazine has good general money management information.
4,A worthwhile purchase from Amazon.,"I have been a great fan of Money Magazine. But I have become a fan also of Amazon. I routinely get offers from the Money Magazine publishers stating what their best subscription price is. When I reviewed the Amazon price it was still lower. Yes I would recommend subscribing to Money, what I really recommend is subscribing through Amazon. It is a money saving option."
3,(Easy) Money,"Not real bright on financial matters? Need commen-sense broken down into even simplier terms? Then, this magazine is for you. Written by what I suspect are a bunch of journalism graduates in New York City with no idea about what they are writting, living in New York City (a stupid idea on writer's salary), I am ashamed to say that I will continue subscribing just to see the monthly picture of the female editor's slender legs.Parents, get this magazine for your teenage daughters because it is a good introduction to finance.I especially enjoy reading the articles showcasing the investment strategies of recently divorced 50-year old gold diggers whose entire portfolio is built solely upon taking half of the ex-husbands 401K that he probably killed himself for 30 years trying to fund."
1,Money Magazine,"I placed the order January 17, 2011 and still haven't received my first issue. I am not sure who is at fault Amazon or Money. I don't care all I want is the magazine.***** NO STARS *****"
1,Don't waste your time on this!,"I ordered this magzine two-months ago, but nothing has showed up even today. Do you want to wait longer?"
3,Too soon to tell,"Gutter Brush was easy to install and the concept seems like it will work. I installed them about a month ago, and the leaves are just now beginning to fall. I did notice, as I read in another review, that the leaves get stuck in the tines of the brush, so although the water is getting into the gutter and draining properly, the outside appearance is that I have a gutter full of leaves. I will wait until spring to see if the weather/wind/exposure etc. gets rid of them before I complete ""gutterbrushing"" my house. Because if I have to get up on a ladder every season to wipe the leaves out of the brushes, what's the point? I might as well just buy some cheap cages to protect the downspouts from getting cluttered and clean out the leaves manually since I have to get up on a ladder anyway. Time will tell."
3,Not as strong as volume 1,"Some tracks stronger than others...""I Feel the Earth Move"" could have been omitted, for example...contains the albums ""No Way"" and ""What it Is"", originally released on Prestige in 1970 and 1971...a young Grover Washington Jr. on tenor sax, Bernard Purdie on drums."
2,A big disappointment,"I am an avid Mary Black fan, but I have to say that this one was a big disappointment. Not only is Declan Sinnott conspicuous by his abscence, but the percussion here is way too overbearing. It doesn't fit with the subtlety and beauty of Mary's lilting voice, no matter what kind of song she is delivering. Apparently producer Larry Klein isn't aware of that. Definitely not up to par with her other work."
2,Mary Goes pop?,"Yes, Mary does pop too. But there are a couple of good songs here, perhaps three. The best for me is between ""Nobody lives without love"" and ""Beautiful"" but I'd agree that there is a tendency toward the melodramatic in these and other songs of this album. And perhaps Mary hasn't heard that other song ""You've got a friend"" by J.Taylor (or was it C.King?) or even S & G's ""Bridge over troubled waters"" before she decided to do P.Brady's ""I will be there"" cause maybe she wouldn't have bothered. And when the album reaches ""Late night radio"" I just reach for the Stop button. But then again I must be getting old."
2,A disappointment.,"Mary Black has made some wonderful albums but this is not one of them. Her talents are lost on the mediocre material on Shine. If you are interested in hearing classic Mary Black, try Babes in the Wood and The Holy Ground"
4,"Mary is great, and everyone evolves.","After reading the whining reviews here that lament Mary not putting out the same album year after year, I have to say they couldn't be more wrong about the quality of the music and the voice. On 'Shine' MB updates the music to bring it into the 90's, but retains all of her vocal quality and ability to emote and make us care about what she's got to say. A standout is her performance on Richard Thompson's 'I misunderstood' which she does far better than the writer himself. RT makes it sound like a practical joke. MB makes us remember when *we* thought someone was wishing us good luck, and was really saying good bye. Everyone evolves, including Mary Black. So put away the prejudices against up-to-date music and give an open listen. You won't be sorry."
5,Listen a few times ...,"I have to admit: when I bought this CD first, I didn't much care for it; I knew Mary Black as a Celtic artist, not one who strayed closer to what seemed pop and, at times, country -- which was what this album seemed to do. After listening to it a few times, however, the music really grew on me: it's distinctive Mary Black vocal style and equally distinctive interpretation, beautiful and surprisingly well-sung. Try ""One and Only"" for a more upbeat angle, and ""Nobody Lives Without Love"" for a softer song that's equally beautiful. Though some might find this a ""sell-out"" or less good than some of her other albums, I personally think all the songs on this album live up to the title and really do shine."
1,MARY'S WORST RECORDING TO DATE,"I HAVE MOST OF MARY'S RECORDINGS AND THIS ONE IS THE WORST. SHE TRIED TO PLEASE THE POP MARKET AND ABANDONED THE MARKET OF WHICH SHE TRULY ""SHINED"". I HOPE THIS WAS JUST AN EXPERIMENT WITH HER MUSIC AND NOT HER NEW DIRECTION. SHE SEEMS LOST IN THIS RECORD, OUT OF HER ELEMENT."
2,No Dec Sinnot and no Noel Brazil..a real disappointment,"For Mary Black fans this release will be a real disappointment. Gone is her normal group of songwriters most notably Noel Brazil, much of her band and Declan Sinnot who, in my opinion, made her the artist that she is."
2,Only fit for Hustler magazine,"What a disappointment. Nothing but cursing, unlikable, manic-depressive characters, the crudest possible language and ugly sex scenes...if it weren't for the few segments on Balanchine this book would have gone into the trash much sooner - but the 'author' has taken quite a bit of literary license with him beyond what she admits to (for example, Suzanne Farrell never visited Balanchine in the hospital when he was dying)...anyway, if you are looking for a story about love and the ballet, I recommend passing this horrid thing up and not wasting your money."
1,"Not a love story, but a LUST story","This book was my book club's book this month. We were all disappointed with the shallow, psychotic characters and the depressing story line. The title and cover make one expect a love story, when really it follows more along the lines of a sick and twisted tragedy. Foreshadowing was too obvious, and love did not seem to be a priority (promiscuity, death, and drug use seemed to be the main topics here). Stay away if you are expecting a love story, or even a very interesting book."
2,Very Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this novel, but was very disappointed by the ending that did not tie up any loose ends. If you are like me and like a book to have a conclusion then don't read this. The author seems to be confused on who is the main character, making the reader believe that Adam and Sandra are, while it ends with George Balanchine's thoughts, and leaves the lovers at odds. It had potential to be a good book but Sharp screws it up by the vague and meaningless ending. It was vulgar at times, and not the romantic love story the jacket cover makes you believe. Don't waste your time with this one, it is not at all satisfying, only infuriating."
1,hackwork,"There are other sources of information about Lou Harrison, such as ""The Music of Lou Harrsion"" by Heidi Von Gunden and ""The Lou Harrison Reader"". There are much better biographies of much better and more significant twentieth-century composers, such as ""Gyorgy Ligeti"" by Richard Toop. There are much better biographies of colorful American figures associated with twentieth-century music, such as ""Woody Guthrie: A Life"" by Joe Klein. In short, I don't think we ought to put up with this piece of clumsy mannered hackwork. (By the way, the chapter on Lou Harrison's sexuality is ridiculous and unnecessary: Take him at his word.)"
1,tedious,"The authors explain in the introduction that but for commercial constraints they could have made a much larger book, in fact a book of each chapter. This is precisely the wrong way to think about any kind of creative work. Creation is SELECTION. Anyone can gather facts and factoids (or as Lou Harrison might say, facticles) and make a great pile of them. It is quite another thing to forge them into a clear, compelling narrative line, and this other thing is just what the authors fail to accomplish. It's safe to assume, I think, that a Lou Harrison autobiography would be much, much, much better than this."
3,Victims looking for sympathy,"If your one of those people who likes to having everything and is a hardcore fan order now. Containing the live version of Bumble Bee is definately a plus and also the b-side Blood Tests which has a different sound then the debut album but may be something you want to hear, it is all up to how important it is to you. The live track makes is worth while"
4,Use of this book,This book explains in an easy way a method to implement a Capacity Measurement Initiative. This book is very useful if you are looking to implement it at your organsation.Charpter 2 contains a basic explaination of CAM-I Capacity ModelCharpter 3 contains a very useful template set to use them as a guideCharpter 4 you will find some implementation examples for manufacturing and service indutries.
5,"If you like the business side of sports, this is for you.","If you find what goes on in the front office just as interesting as what happens on the field, you will enjoy this book. If you have any knowledge of the Midwest League, the stadiums and locals will be very familiar and add to the enjoyment of the book. The most interesting part of the book is what has changed and hasn't since 1992. The book talks about the state of the art stadiums built by Fort Wayne, South Bend and Quad City making it tough for Waterloo. However by the mid 2000s, stadiums built in Dayton, Lansing, etc. made Fort Wayne and Quad City build newer stadiums for their teams and almost cost South Bend their franchise.I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same. However despite almost 20 years old, this book remains relevant and an entertaining read."
5,Soothing and Quite Dazzling,"I ordered this product because I like Ravi Shankar and other world music and I thought that L. Subramaniam would sound a lot like that traditional-sounding East Indian music. I was surprised to find out that L. Subramaniam (at least as represented by this CD) is more of a fusion/jazz artist. Many of the musicians he appears with here, are in fact jazz oriented (Maynard Fergerson & Hubert Laws). Although I always liked jazz, I never got into the more ""electric"", ""fusion"" or ""new age"" type sounding jazz. This CD is all of those things plus some of that traditional East Indian feel. It is also quite ""funkified"". Given an even chance, this CD is quite nice, and Dr. Subramaniam is quite a remarkable musician. Parts of this CD are quite soothing and other parts quite dazzling.In terms of genre, it is hard to pin down though."
1,packaging bad.,Spoilable cheese was shipped with 1 sandwich size icepack. Not kept cold and cheese was mouldy. I had to toss it. Only neeted more ice.
5,Kill your television,"A boyfriend gave my mother a copy of this in 1936.She's still reading it, reciting the Shakespeare sonnets, consulting it on astronomy and giggling at the very witty Britty hate poems.There are games and recipes.It is an instruction manual on how to live life outside video games. What a concept."
4,charming,"An old-fashioned,whimsical treatise on how to manage the weekend, with fun and practical tips for life before (or without) the Internet. Recommended reading for the bathroom in one's summer home. Used is a good value. Enjoy:)"
5,honey,This is the best honey I've tried. I first bought it in Canada for a lot more moeny & was verry happy that I could buy it through Amazon (for a lot less). I've tried a few airborne's but this is my favorite
4,Simple Answers in Color,"If you are looking for a good tool for all of those unanswered questions, I highly recommend this book. The Rainbow Oracle also includes a pouch of five cubes, each with certain colors. It is a unique divinatory tool. There are many different readings... However, I find the quick ""one cube"" reading to be quite accurate and very simple. There are a list of common questions and the last simply being ""is the answer to my question yes."" Simply shake the cubes, select 1 cube and roll it. Then look up the color and read the answer to your question. You can also gain more depth on topics by doing a multi-cube reading... Give it a try!!!"
5,Excellent!,"I love the shape of this knife. It is razor sharp and the the shape is very, very comfortable. Like all quality knives, I recommend that you invest in proper storage (like a knife block) and you hand wash it as they recommend."
4,Harlech,"Very tangy and delicious. I know this review doesn't add much to the description above, but at least you'll know that someone who had it likes it."
4,Men of Garlic,"Vinegar is the primary flavor I find in this cheese - which is much sweeter than the Tintern that I ordered with it. It is very good, but I am unsure of my willingness to nibble on much of it as a standalone treat. It really needs to be eaten with something in order for the vinegar to find a balance. Excellent and highly different. A great choice for the cheese lover looking for something unusual."
5,Beat that Ticket !,"This book includes detailed state-by-state info with critical information about traffic laws & court procedures.A must have manual for contesting bum-rap traffic citations, this book belongs to many driver's glove compartment (especially mine )!"
5,Rap at it's Finest,"I can listen to the whole cd from start to finish. So you be the judge of how tight the cd is. Exspecial in a time when most all rap/hip hop cd's sound just a like! ""But you don't have to take my word for it!"""
5,The Bomb,"I heard the Cd and I love it. And you should see them in concert, Man them Kat are off the hook."
4,This book has great sample apps and is well written,"I guess I disagree with some of the other readers. I think the title is appropriate. There are several useful internet applications on the CD and the book goes through them pretty wellThe autors may take too much of a consultants point of view in describing ""how to design"" an application but I think it is a good way to go about development."
1,This Book Is A Rip-Off,"I was extremely disappointed at this book. There are many reasons for this. The number one reason however was when it taught you how to send email from your application and do stuff like that, it said to use a control which DOESN'T EVEN COME WITH VB! The controls cost around $100 dollars. I think thats pretty sad. And if you did buy the controls, you wouldn't need the book because the control makes it so simple. Besides that complaint, about half the book is talking about what the projects do instead of explaining how they work. And even more, this book doesn't go into detail about IIS applications which I hoped it would. Also, this book said ""Intermediate To Advanced"", yet there is a chapter introducing the internet and a very BASIC introduction to HTML. If you ask me, that doesn't sound like Intermediate to Advanced material! This book is a terrible, if Amazon had a rating of 0 Stars, I would have given it."
2,Poor effort at updating a VB5 book.,For a book to be called VB6 for Web Developement I would have thought it would have extensive coverage of the new VB6 IIS application project. If your looking for information on IIS apps look elswhere.
3,Confusing,"The quality of the product is good. Galvanized steel, poweder coated etc... However the instructions and use with the adjust-a-gate is confusing and you pretty much have to figure it out yourself and make your own contraption."
5,Definitive!,Excellent! Definitive! Its all right here. No study of the Catholic faith could possibly be complete without this wonderful book. It is definately the next most important book after the Bible.
3,Great content but the book is too small,The only drawback to this book is its size. It's about the size of a regular paperback book but much thicker with large writing which makes it difficult to use. I would prefer it to be a bit larger so it's easier to use. Since it's so small it's hard to hold it open when studying. I've been trying to find a Catechism in a larger size but they're few and far between.
3,The Credo,I cannot locate the credo in the kindle version like I can the hard copy which shows the two creeds side by side. It should appear after paragraph 184 before section 2 but I cannot find it. Please correct this.
5,Authoritative Teaching of the Catholic Church,"At last the English version of the definitive and revised text of the ""Catechism of the Catholic Church"" has published. For anyone interested in what the Catholic Church teaches about any given topic, this work must be consulted for its official teaching. The revisions are made in light of the changes approved by Pope John Paul II, especially on the matter of capital punishment, and of the many minor corrections introduced into the text. The new index and glossary of terms make this version even more reader friendly than the original. This ""Cathechism"" belongs in every academic library as well as in rectories, religious houses and the homes of those interested in Catholicism. It is a rich, compelling and fascinating source of Catholic teaching. Two thumbs up!"
4,Useful for Reference,"When those questions come up for Catholics about just why do we do thus-and-so on Sunday, what do we believe, etc., there is no other source for modern readers that you need turn to. Every Catholic household should have one. Also, if anyone wants or needs to know exactly what the Catholic church teaches on something, this is the place to turn.The book itself, though, is a little dry to read. It is very well organized as a reference book, but it's not very exciting to read straight through. I'm a bit disappointed that it doesn't contain more delight in the beauty of our faith, awe at the depths of God's revelation of Himself, or simply more practical examples for day-to-day living.Just as you wouldn't read the encyclopedia from cover-to-cover, neither will you read this book straight through. However, it's very easy to look up any individual question you have, and get the straight story."
2,Not for Kindle Fire,"I'm disappointed that the Kindle version hasn't been updated for the Kindle Fire. In the appendix, for instance, when you click on items that start with A you get items that start with E. The same is true for the Glossary. And if you are trying to locate a certain numbered paragraph there are no hyperlinks to get you there. It's still very awkward to use as an E-book and could be much improved. As far as the actual book, however, this is an excellant catechism of the Catholic Church, in fact, the best available. And paying $10. for it is a steal...if only it were more user friendly!"
2,I'd buy Trent's catechism,"The longer I read the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the more I prefer the Catechism of the Council of Trent. The new catechism is wordy, written in confusing, needlessly ecumenical language, and in my opinion, too liberal. The index is thoroughly confusing, too. Sometimes, when I read the index, I can't distinguish between page numbers and paragraph numbers. Other times, I'll look up, say, a word that begins with ""b,"" that won't be in the ""b"" part of the index. Instead of ""baptism, sacrament of,"" you might see ""sacrament of baptism."""
5,Awesome!,"Curious about The Roman Catholic Church? Well here you are, page upon page of information on what The Roman Catholic Church teaches, straight from the source. It is worth its weight in GOLD!"
4,Mannys catholic experience,The book Catechism of the Catholic Church is a real good informational book. You gain a lot by just reading this book. It answers some questions for example: Why prayer is so important in our lives or why some people critizise what we believe. By reading this book it can help you gain some knowledge that you havent inquired before. youl enjoy this book if your interested in learning about your catholic faith.
4,Catechism of he Catholic Church,"It is as good as the hard bound copy, but not as convenient as flipping the pages. The hard bound book weighs a ton and would be ponderous to pack and / or carry. The availability in Kindle version gives comfort to the soul."
1,Impossible,"It is impossible to navigate through the book from references.The catechism is rarely read as a book.All references use paragraph numbers rather than page numbers. This version uses page numbers instead, making even the index impossible to use!"
5,great price,"I purchased this for my collection after having it referred to me in my catechism class. It was a great buy, very interesting book."
2,"More expensive than expected, hard to navigate","No concerns with the content. It is the CCC, with that is good about that.Usability though... sections of the CCC are always stated as CCC numbers, but this eBook provides to good way to find them. Less useful than the printed version.More than twice the cost of the new 2011 bible, seems too expensive (was about $10?) for an electronic book."
5,I was talking to a few Muslims about the Bible...,"Yeah. Like I said, I was talking to a few Muslims about the Bible and how we never meant for it to contain all of our Church's teachings. So this book serves as a great Visual Aid for puzzled Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Non-Christians alike as to the correct position of the Bible, for one thing. But why I totally love this book is this reason: philosophy, theology, apologetics, history, etc. all in one (thick!!!) roof! It is more reader-friendly (at least to 16-year olds like me) than Dr. Ludwig Ott's Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, though I love that book too. I highly recommend this book, plus Dr. Ott's Fundamentals...Dogma, the set of Radio Replies, and the Summa Theologica (by st. thomas aquinas) to all the Homo Sapiens out there (i.e. You :) Buy it now!! No, don't give me that weird look!- put the book in your cart! lol ciao!"
1,"BLANK PAGE, NO TEXT",BEWARE OF THIS ITEM! Big tip-off 45kb for a book of over 700 pages. For $2.39 I got a blank page! Don't waste your money til Amazon gets this right and actually makes the text available. To their credit they did refund my money immediately.
4,Great buy,Happy with purchase and will purchase again from this company. Just wish it wouldn't have taken so long to get to me.
4,Not Kindle Fire accessable,"I was so excited when I discovered this Catechism on Amazon. The price is a little high but worth not having to carry the hard covered book around with a Bible and two other books for study sessions. However, when I tried to access it by the article number instead of name it is not possible. Kindle Fire is very limited as to being campatible with many products. It is great otherwise."
5,Five stars for usefulness-- not for content!,"I give this book 5 stars because it is, hands down, the best tool for a fundamentalist Christian soul winner to use when dealing with Roman Catholic laypeople. This way, you aren't arguing with Karl Keating or Paul Kreeft or some other ""unofficial"" apologist for Rome-- you are taking your views of Roman dogma straight from the top!Do you meet someone door-to-door who says Catholics don't believe in salvation by works? Take them STRAIGHT to the CATECHISM! Or how about the Church's position on Mariolatry? Forget the Protestant tracts and go to the CATECHISM! I could go on, but you get the picture. Suffice it to say that every humble Bible-believer should own a copy. (Just do your conscience a favor and try to find it used.)"
2,We need a new Catechism,"I don't understand why this is being promoted. Benedict is so out of touch with the people in the Church that anything he says is null and void even before published. I think there should be a generic Catechism for children that doesn't include exclusion or punishment but instead emphasizes love and empathy for one another. The Bishops are wrong in most of their announcements. And, they refuse to be held accountable for the terrible sexual abuse they condoned for so many years."
1,Do not purchase!!,"Unbelievable. As a lifetime Catholic for 43+ years and just made my spouse recently convert, I wanted to purchase a book that can tell us about the Roman Catholic faith in simple words. Unfortunately, this book is a huge turnoff and extremely difficult to read and comprehend. I do not think I can find any text in this book that I can understand. I would strongly advise purchasing this 'informative' book on the Catholic Church. I wish I can find a book that is more to my liking."
5,The Definitive Roman Catholic Catechism,This should be considered the definitive statement of the Roman Catholic Church's thinking and belief to-date. Answers many questions and clarifies specific issues currently in the fore of Catholic and world thought. A very useful resource.
3,Helpful for understanding Roman Catholic teaching,"All paragraphs are numbered. At the end of each paragraph are numbers to other paragraphs so the reader can find further information. There is a very good index. Yet, the paragraphs often seem to talk around a topic without nailing down a point in clear language. I did a search for 'purgatory.' When I finished references were sending me back to paragraphs I read at the beginning of the search, all while not really answering some of my questions."
5,Very popular for discussions,Very popular in my discussions with folks of other religions. The definitive Catechism. A must have for anyone calling themselves Catholic who wants to ACTUALLY be a Catholic. Would be very useful/inspiring for any Christian. Very well cross-referenced. Would solve ALL our problems if used.
5,catechism,"I was very gratified you had it available. The book is relatively easy to access, look up content and- of course- portable."
2,Difficult to navegate.,"I need to navegate by the paragraph numbers but this ebook does not do this unless there is something I have not been told. The content is there and I can look up topics but when I am doing a study of Catholic Doctrines and am given certain paragraph numbers to locate, I must go to the free book on my cell phone. Can they add a link where we can use the paragraph numbers? If so it would be great and I don't have to find it on my cell phone.protek2"
4,The Catechism,Excellent content. It needs to be searchable by paragraph number. That would make it much easier to use for all students of the faith.
5,Catechism of the Catholic Church,"This is a great reference on how the Catholic Church has developed its philosophy over the ages. It give you an answer on why things are, but like any book, you have to look it up."
3,Catechism too wordy,I found this book too wordy. It is more a trade book than one for a lay person who wants quick explanations.
1,Great Book did not hold up to the test of time ....,"Although the book is an excellent theological study, it presents the teaching of the church in a well organized manner, it litterally fell apart in my hands. As I was reading, page after page detached itself from the binding.I teach and have at time lost my page, but always managed to find it again in my book. With this edition, I could literally loose my page and have it be in a different location.I would loose my job if this were the quality of my work. (Can you tell I am mad?)If you are going to buy this book, get the hard bound version."
2,Catechism of the Catholic Church,"This volume is an outdated version of a reference book which I used for research purposes. It is no longer current as it refers to other material, but it is still easy enough to understand and is not so far out of date as to give erroneous information. While a more current Catechism has been available for several years, this book is perfectly suitable as a reference for the average layperson, Catholic or non-Catholic."
3,Dry. Difficult to understand. Vague.,"If ""The Catechism of the Catholic Church"" had been less like the Bible, I think it could have been insightful and educational. I wanted badly to learn more about my faith, but I had a difficult time understanding all the rhetoric, the talking in circles, the vague and confusing explanations. Plain English is what this book needs. There were many parts that intrigued me, and many parts I found beautifully written, but it sure was hard to follow for the most part and I think it could have been made a lot easier for the lay person with some simple explanations. So far, the best I have learned about my faith is in church. This book will more than likely confuse the person trying to learn about this beautiful faith."
4,You need a foundation,"This is a great book but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for someone who is just starting to explore the Catholic faith. The book was originally intended for bishops and is therefore written with the assumption that the reader already has a good knowledge of Catholic doctrine and theology. If you have some foundation this is a great book to get to further your knowledge but it you are just starting get something that is more explanatory.Also, if you are debating between this ""big green"" addition vs. the smaller (and cheaper) white one I would go with this one. It is far worth the extra money because of the more thorough index in the back."
2,Review of purchase of Catechism of the Catholic Church,"The book was advertised as like new. But every page has writing on it, bent cover page. At times the writing in the book makes it difficult to read some of the printed words. Not what I expected to be when advertised as like-new."
4,"Great, but would be better on my kindle!","Please release this to the kindle. There isn't the normal link to click to make the request. I am enjoying reading it, but am struggling with the paper copy. Thanks."
3,Dad's gift,This is not a sit down and read from cover to cover. But is a good reference book. It is what he was looking for and now he feels he can speak with some authority.
5,A Lot of Solid Christian Teaching,"As a person who joined a strange church, a long time ago, because they had nice booklets --I never learned Christian Fundamentals that were important. Most of these teachings basic in the Orthodox and Catholic church.That's one reason why having a million denominations all claiming to have the truth is bad.Fundamentals are so key."
3,Digital issue more difficult to use,"In this instance I prefer the hardback copy. On the digital issue it's hard to find the passages you need promptly since there is not an ability to search by text paragraph numbers. the Index's are wonderful but refer you to the paragraph number of the scripture/or subject matter that is looked up, very easy to find in the hardback."
2,"Great, but inaccessible, content","This is the best reference for access to systematically understandable explanations for how and why to live the Christian life. That said, this book is not designed to be read from cover to cover, no more than an encyclopedia would be. In this version, I have difficulty navigating to, say, the index in the back or to paragraph 1242 (just to pick a random number). I tried bookmarking every so many paragraphs, but that typically does not work. Okay, maybe I'm just behind the curve and don't know how some feature or another works, but I've spent some time trying. It should be laid out like a bible or legal app with sections, outlines, aids and numbered paragraphs clearly accessible."
5,Convenient,I have a soft covered Catechism on my shelf but this electronic version is much more convenient to carry with me in my iPad.
5,Comprehensive guide to the faith,"This is book is a must-have for Catholic Christians. It goes into detail about what Catholics believe and why they believe it. It is very clear and easy to read. If you are looking for something lighter as more of an introduction, please get the compendium along with this to read first."
3,Easy to use on traditional Kindle,"I have an old Kindle with keyboard and I have no issues searching for paragraph numbers. On my newer Kindle Fire, however, it is not as compatible."
4,The Catholic Faith Explained and Ascertained,"Here is the long awaited arrival of the new, completely revised and updated Catechism of the Catholic Church. The value of this Catechism may be summed up rather concisely...it is absolutely indispensable!"
5,Must have for reference any christian library,"The paper back edition and pocket book edition are great for everyday use but this is a must have for the serious student who maintains their own reference library. As with the other editions, this is a must have right next to the Bible. Find out what the Catholic Church REALLY teaches. You do not have to be a Bishop to read or understand this one. The faith explained using todays language and using Scripture, Church documents, writings of the early Fathers, Church Doctors and Saints. The only draw back is the less than spectacular art work for the dust jacket."
5,Theories of learning,"I received this book after ordering it and it turned out to be the wrong book that I ordered. The person was very nice in refunding my money to me right away after sending it back. I give the company five stars because it was completely my fault and they worked with me, no questions asked."
1,Very Unhappy,I have never received my book. I emailed the sender after the alloted time period (about three weeks) and they never responded. I filed a complaint with Amazon a week ago and have gotten no response. I know there are times when everybody seems to get it wrong and this seems to be it. I am not going to stop using Amazon but I am a very disgusted customer and now I am ask to write a review?
4,Great textbook for my class.,"This was the required textbook for an, ""Acting Styles,"" class I took in college. It's a bit wordy at times, but what textbooks aren't. It proved to be a very informative and helpful guide."
5,Thunder from the Sea,"Thunder from the Sea is written by Joan Hiatt Harlow and a good book for ages 10 and up. It is set in Newfoundland, Canada in 1929. A thirteen-year old Tom Campbell found a dog. He named it Thunder. Bert, another character in the story wanted to fight Tom because Bert wanted the reward for finding the missing dog. There are a couple problems but I will only tell you one. Fiona's mom figured out that she is having a baby in the winter. Thunder and Tom help Fiona get to the doctor. But, during the trip over the ice, the ice cracked. How will they get over? Find out by reading this great historical fiction story. This is a must read book!"
4,Thunder from the Sea,"A great story....a great picture of the harsh, yet very loving, life in Newfoundland in the early part of the 1900's. Yet another reason to look fondly on the Newfie."
1,Perfect example of how not to write a textbook,"Here is the very first sentence the user is asked to read in Arabic (chapter 5): ""The class room is a place in which students gather before the teachers, who explain the lessons and write notes on the blackboard with the chalkpiece."" This pretty much says it all, I think. This book progresses from teaching the alphabet to unmarked, unglossed Arabic poetry in just 150 pages. Even the titles of the final chapters are in Arabic, with no exercises for using the material. Two possible uses for this material: 1) as a great example in teacher training courses of how not to write a textbook, and 2) for heritage speakers who want to become literate, although this second use is questionable since the material is just so dry."
2,Not for Beginners,"I found the structure of this book to be quite confusing. The explanations of grammatical patterns seemed haphazard, at best, and were difficult to follow. Many chapters started with paragraphs of arabic sentences, with English translations, with explanations of the grammar used following. Important information often comes pages after the arabic examples it explains (for example, the fact that singular indefinite nouns are always prounced with 'un' at the end, three pages after seeing the words and the incorrect transliterations). The romanization used was inconsistent across the book.I am not stranger to foreign languages, with my studies spanning the globe from standard Romance languages (French and Spanish) to Japanese. Despite that, and unfortunate experiences with many extraordinarily bad texts, I still had trouble following this one."
3,Good but not for beginners,"I bought this book as a text book for my arabic class. If you have a teacher this is an alright book, if you don't have a teacher don't plan on learning any real lessons other then some vocabulary. There are supposed to be tapes that come with the book, but no body seems to know where to get them. Their lesson plans focus too much on the writing of the arabic rather then my main purpose of the speaking. By the time you get to the 10th chapter, there isn't any more english written!"
2,Not for Beginners,"The structure was bad, and the ""basics"" were either not basic or had poor grouping. A better book for beginners isRead and Speak Arabic for Beginners."
2,a bit abnormal,"Rose hasn't had a great life. Her mom suffers from depression and other problems, so she couldn't take care of her children properly. It's up to Rose to provide for herself and her little sister, Dani, who has downs syndrome. When Rose gets caught stealing, she and Dani get put into the foster care system. Then they get split up. Rose goes to live with the a poster family for normalcy, and Dani gets put in a home run by the wicked witch. They won't let Rose see her sister. Also, her crush Brian is currently Dani's foster brother. Thanks to the computer game ALTLIVES, Rose gets a chance to check up on her family. When her new life gets tricky, will Rose opt to change back to her old life, no matter what the cost?"
5,awesome jimmy pop,"the bloodhound gang is really great and i can't wait for their next album to come out (soon!). lead singer jimmy pop is cool, cool-looking and the music rocks."
3,school kids pathological cases,"I liked the math rash, but the book was just too""set up"" for me with cases of each of the problem childrenin an elementary school third grade.The book has Magic solutions to their problem of bullying, doodling, forgetfulness, babbling-talking, etc. The problems exist but I doubt that the book does much to solve them.It actually might be of more use in training grade school teachers?"
5,Another funny Douglas Evans book,"My class and I were excited to find another book that takes place in the strange classroom at the end of the hall by Douglas Evans. His first book CLASSROOM AT THE END OF THE HALL was good, but this one is great. Especially Ti-2, the pencil grinder, who sells his pencil shavings to chefs in Pennsylvania."
4,pure joy,"What a joy it is to listen to this cd. This was my introduction to Curtis, and from here I have now bought 9 more of his cds. Rhino does a very good job here. Many of the tracks on this comp did not make it on to the box set (a prayer, jesus) which makes no sense because they are great songs. Here you get a lighter, inspirational side of this great visonarys talent. Still, songs like Heaven and keep on pushin, rock your socks off! If you dont own any Curtis this is a good place to start. Discovering Curtis is truly a ""blessing"" for any music lover, and these rhino issues sound great and are priced right on amazon!"
5,For Everyone to Enjoy,"I purchased the first copy of this more than 15 years ago from Readers Digests, but somehow lost the copy. i just had to have it again, and I still look at it at least once a year. When we get European visitors I make them all look at it and they all love it."
4,Satisfied.,The product I ordered in good shape. I little slower to arrive than 2nd order from another company made at the same time.
5,Great quality and price,"I was pleased to find this item compentently displayed and at an outstanding price. I tried to find the item locally in the length that I needed to no avail, and online searches produced a lot of material but not the correct item. I was pleased to see that Amazon.com had the item that I needed, with reasonable cost and shipping alternatives. Next time I'll start my search with Amazon."
4,A collection of simple poems about the togetherness aspects of love,"The primary theme of this collection of poems is the togetherness aspects of love. They are about sharing, experiencing and performing together. Tenderness, softness, and what togetherness truly means are all expressed and re-expressed in short, simple poems that are easy to understand. My favorite is on page 37I am here for youI am here for meI have comefor the both of us.We have a long wayto gojust to the beginning...Longer yet, I hopeto the end...together.As you can see, the simplicity of the messages gives them much of their power."
5,fantastic book of art and Ferrari's views on drivers,"I was sent this book by Ferrari as a gift for sending him photos and a description of a hypothetical Ferrari air racer model I made back then (early 1985, the book had just been published). It was quite a treat to receive the book, and I have really enjoyed looking at it over and over again. It is a feast for the eyes. Wish I knew Italian, as he has written a commentary on the various periods of racing since early days and on the drivers (the title ""Piloti, Che Gente"" means ""Drivers, What People""-at least that's what my neighbor Romeo Bianchi told me at the time!), and it would be enlightening to know his thoughts on the various drivers. The main body of the book is an amazing collection of art and photos through the many years of racing covered. You will never find all these images anywhere else. I give it 5 stars because it really is a work of art, even though I can't read it!"
4,Good Read - Mediocre Trilogy Ending,"A satisfying read, with a very interesting storyline about a religious cult based on the mysterious, momentary disappearances of a gas-giant planet. In some ways I found this book more enjoyable than the previous two, although I believe all three are worth reading. My biggest complaint would be the ending which seemed to come out of nowhere and didn't get the development it deserved. In some ways, I think Absolution Gap is better read as a standalone novel. In that sense it was a great book. As a conclusion to a 1500 page trilogy, however, it was a bit of a disappointment."
2,Ugh,A disappointment for all the reasons others have given. No satisfaction after a great buildup in the prior book.
2,Horrible ending race to the finish,"The ending of this book was a total and complete let down. I will not go into it but I was truly disappointed by the ending. When I had about 30 pages left I knew already it wasn't going to end worth a damn and I was right. Maybe some are fans of leaving plots unfinished and people left in limbo but I am not one of them. It was like ""well i don't know how to finish this with a great ending so I will just have the pig fall over"".And yes I figured out who the shadows were I always did from the plot in the second book.I enjoyed the story up until the end although they were seriously dry and disjointed in several areas. Read three books to have a final that was in an epilogue because the writer couldn't be bothered to write an ending for numerous interesting characters and plots. I don't think so I will not be reading anymore of this nonsense."
2,Good start but trouble later,"The first half is great continuation of the previous book. Unfortunately at about half way it gets bogged down in personal reflections, illogical character shifts (or maybe legitimate senility?) and masses of repetition. The latter lost the book a star for me, repeating the same explanation of events 3-4 times (often for the benefit of characters in the book - couldn't they have just read the earlier chapters?) is boring and frustrating.No problem with the main story though. Keen to read more if Reynolds treats us like adults again. Adults with more than 50 page memories even."
2,Writing to a deadline,"First point; this book is the last of a massive trilogy, and it won't make a bit of sense if you don't read the first two volumes, in order. Imagine reading ""The Return of the King"" as your first foray in Tolkien. You wouldn't want to.Second point: After almost 2,000 pages, a feat worthy of Proust, Reynolds just gives up. The resolution is short, undeveloped, and unsatisfying. As other reviewers have noted, it's a deus ex machina ending. Apparently Reynolds's publisher told him to either send them manuscript, or a check refunding their advance.Reynolds creates an interesting future world, which we'll probably see a lot more of (vide Ian M. Banks), but this book left me feeling let down.Roger Rensvold"
2,Ponderous saga about something?,"Ponderous and long. I had a hard time getting past the story line of moving cathedrals...the moving, I understand (as much as I can understand most religious mumbo-jumbo reasons for doing anything), but how did a poor planet make these things? Of course, I couldn't get past this question for Tatooine either, but Star Wars (the movie) was less than two hours and was a fantasy, not sci-fi. This was not worth my time--or yours."
2,Really?!?,"What a terribly disappointing conclusion to such a wonderful series. That's really all I can say. I felt like Mr. Reynolds had just played a prank on me: ""Ha, ha. Made you read"". I mean, Peter Hamilton writes better endings! I only give two stars out of respect for the previous books."
2,Badly needed an editor,"This book made me wish I hadn't started the series. Reynolds put about 350 pages of story and ideas into 700+ pages, and then leaves you with a very rushed ending that has characters act out of character, one character come to an end I still don't really understand (it took a couple sentences), and too much deux es machina. Either the editor did not do his job here to guide Reynolds, or he ignored that editor."
2,A Cosmic letdown...,"I seriously was mad at Reynolds.I had spent a lot of time reading the books (the 4 in the series). I invested a lot of thought to follow the plot line and sub-plots. I found his writing captivating.Then I get to the end of Absolution Gap...After 750+ pages of story, the summation of the 4-part series, the conclusion is only given a paragraph, or maybe just a sentence or two of attention (throughout the entire book). Something so undeveloped, it felt as though Alastair ran out of ideas and was like, ""The detective knew he was going to be killed by the killer in the next room, but somehow, suddenly, someone scared the killer away. The End.""I was ticked, to say the least.This series is, perhaps, worth the reading just for the sub-plots and style, but in the end, it's a huge disappointment. I'd welcome any comments to convince me why I should read any of Alastair's other books. I want to believe they'll be better..."
3,"Hopefully, the real ending of the the story is yet to be written","I really enjoy Reynolds' books and the RS universe, but this was a lousy end to the trilogy. I can only hope he actually plans to write a proper ending/explanation later on.I don't have a problem with the evolution of the characters and the story which carries over from the last book. But I have a problem with the new story, Hela and Quaische. I really don't buy anything about that colony, it's purpose, characters or the whole religious aspect. And that's a huge chunk of the book to discount. Add to this that Reynolds went into excruciating detail describing the landscape of Hela. I was bored out of my mind through much of that.But I kept going to the end. When I got there I found nearly everything we had been building up to was almost ""dismissed."" I honestly wonder if Reynolds got tired writing and just tried to finish up as soon as possible. I really hope he intends to pick this up later on."
1,I really wanted to like this book.....,"Having read the other books set in this future universe I really hoped this final book would pull everything together. It didn't. There is no 'Drama'. Interesting things do happen but, for me, they had no emotional weight. Great ideas pieced together with dry filler simply fall flat. Characters perform some of the most interesting action off stage, the reader is left to fill in details. A boring finale. I can find no reason to reccomend this book."
1,Save yourself,"I got hooked into reading this series till the end. The first book was pretty good, leaving you with a taste for more, curious about how all the loose ends would be tied together. However, after getting through the 1500+ pages of the second and third books, I can say that author had no idea where he was going with the story. It is a laborious read, carried by many irrelevant characters that the author throws your way to make an uninteresting story drag on endlessly with no rhyme or reason. Almost all threads started and never developed to satisfaction. The actual conclusion of this ultimate book is just plain random and unrelated to anything. As a recommendation I would suggest reading the first book and then the epilogue of the third book (which is the actual lame ending), realizing that the content of the epilogue actually has only a vague tangential relationship to the content of the third and second books.. so you really havn't missed anything."
1,Horrible,"On the opposite quality spectrum than the other parts of the serie.The way author solves the few crisis threads just revolted me. It was so plain unlogical, unrewarding - like the author wanted to just finish the chapter.I hate this part of the serie. Don't waste your time and psyche."
4,A resolution where no resolution seemed possible,"I'd been reading this book over a couple of weeks. While it's deeplyengrossing, it's also a little wearing to be so deeply immersed in theRevelation Space universe again. Happy to space it out with some otherbooks, but still a fantastic read. It has a lot more resolution thanthe other books in the quartet and seems to be a nominal end to thesaga. Everything familiar from the previous books is there, but therearen't many brand new unexpected plotlines turning up, being aresolving book and all.The plot is a little disconnected at first until the references startbuilding up enough that you realise the book is all uniformlyconnected and merely multi-linear and interwoven. A heavilyrecommended read, probably the one I enjoyed most from the RSuniverse."
3,Okay product,I liked the panasonic massager only thing i have to say is the noise it creates is kind of irritating
2,Hard to use,"This thing is murder on my wrists, which have zero cartilage. Doesn't do a very good job on deep tissue work, and overheats quickly. I haven't found a single setting that does what my old cheapo homedics shiatsu machine did for my back. I'm going to try to find a replacement Homemedics that doesn't ""vibrate"" but actually thumps hard enough to get to the sore ligaments and tendons like my original massager.The head is so narrow you can't get any pressure by using it while sitting in your recliner (it flips to the side) and there's no way to get enough pressure by just holding it. If you have someone to do the massage to you, then this might be good but since it doesn't come equipped with a husband, I'll have to find something that is more single-user friendly.I do NOT recommend this. There are much better options out there."
4,Great for the little aches and pains.,I like using this for the little aches and pains that attack from time to time. The weight is good and makes it easier to use.
5,Hand-held Massager,My husband uses the massager frequently as his muscles get tense. He likes the strength and power of this model and will purchase again.
5,Panasonic EV2510K,"Well designed, simple 2 speed control, vibrating rollers work good for me at age 79, 10 minute use on front center thigh muscle (quadricep) and crease between my leg and hip reduced pain that had persisted over 2 months so I could get more involved in my Silver Sneakers and Yoga classes.Tom"
4,pretty good for the price,"This back massager works pretty well. It is quite noisy, and has started making a screeching sound from time to time, but its still a good deal for the price. It has 2 speeds, and has really helped with a knot I have on my back. Easy to use on your own. Has to be plugged into the wall. Kind of ugly looking, but I would buy it again since the price was so low compared to the other ones I was looking at."
5,This works for me,My shoulder gets sour from sitting in from of the computer and typing too much.This machine give me some relief. I highly recommend it
2,Sending it back,"Panasonic is always a good name to rely on, but this massager is just not for me. I ordered it partly because of the brand name, but mostly for that peculiar little hook, which I was hoping would dig into this one spot on the top of my shoulder, which I press into with my thumb for pain relief.Hard to tell in the picture, but this machine is really huge and too heavy and cumbersome for me to use. I have a torn rotator cuff in my right shoulder, and I normally wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. in a lot of pain. Because it is my right shoulder, I have to use the massager with my left hand, and it is really very awkward for me. Plus, that little hook does not quite fit into that painful spot on top of my shoulder. Also, it is quite noisy, although I imagine that is a situation with most of this type of product.Am ordering, instead, a smaller cordless version in another brand, and will keep on trying until I find the one that helps dispel the pain that wakes me up in the middle of the night."
2,must be made in korea or china,"I hate to see another good brand go downhill. I used to swear by this brand but now just swear at it! this thing has no power, u can slow it almost to a stop just by holding it by hand. the cord is too short and so thin as to be like string! i'll be surprised if it last 6 mo. with little use, it's just cheaply made. I would not reccomend this product."
1,just a cheaply made vibrator,"if Amazon.com has a physical store, I would bring this back for a full refund. I am regretted for buying this Panasonic EV2510K, a cheaply made product, lack of punch power, and cannot do its job as a hand held massager. It is misleading people by displaying it as a hand held massager, it should be labelled hand held vibrator instead."
2,"If you like lots of power, give this product a miss","Having massage wheels instead of bumps makes it very easy to use this product. People who are older will appreciate its light weight and non-abusive power. However, I personally like a lot of power to work on my sore muscles and this product doesn't cut it for me. Also, the massage hook is effectively useless. Overall, it is reasonable value for the money but I wish I had spent more on something more effective. Guess it serves me right for being cheap."
4,Great item!,"After reading the reviews on several massagers, I settled on this Panasonic and can only say, ""WOW!"" This is an awesome massager and I love the different ""heads"" you can use. It is very well made, easy to use and I highly recommend it!"
3,Are you a bad girl?,"Inside every good girl is a bad girl dying to bust out. Along with some sweet talk, having some accessories helps to unleash the devil-girl within. Be a bad girl and watch your love/sex life ERUPT."
2,false advertising,I can't add much to the other reviews they are pretty accurate. I do want to point out that the online portion of this book no longer exists and that the publisher nor Amazon points this out when they sell you the book. Instead you are directed to the SAMS online learning site which of course does not include material ffor this book. I would not purchase it on principle because I felt that I was decieved as to what I was purchasing.
2,A 'fair' book at best,"I had hoped for a better book on Visual Basic and web development, however this book spends 5 out of 13 chapters (more than 1/3 of the book) on how to use MS-Access. Also, I had trouble downloading the additional needed software, and the book was no help at all. Stick with the 'Visual Basic 6.0 Interactive Course' book (5-Star rating) and a different book on web development."
1,Power cord and connection problems to no end,"I spent over $300 in repairs to try to fix the power problems. It still does not work or charge properly. I went to several forums online for help, and apparently this is a common problem with this model. I do not recommend this laptop at all. It also weighs 15lbs, so not recommended if you have to carry it around a lot."
4,"HP Pavilion zv6130us 15.4"" Notebook PC (AMD Athlon 64 Processor 3200+, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD+/-R/RW and CD-RW Combo","This laptop is a great laptop. I recently graduated for InterActive Media Design. And it's been a great help for me. I'm using Adobe softwares and Dreamweaver softwares and the processor speed is pretty faast. Although the battery life doesnt last that long, it's still pretty good for design softwares and for movies too because of its widescreen. And its not bad for playing games too. It has a lot of hard drive. Great graphics. great laptop."
2,Hmmmmm...........,the quality of tech support is not good.Very slow...There is not support really after 2 years - the charge you a lot of money.I just bought a Dell - its much better.
4,Pop goes the Eyesinweasel,"Eyesinweasel is Tobin Sprout's(ex-GbV) new band.This cd is jam packed with beautiful,intelligent songs that showcase Tobin's growth as a songwriter.The other musicians in Eyesinweasel contribute a somewhat rockier feel to this cd than prior Tobin solo efforts.7&9 is a perfect uptempo opener with it's catchy little chorus and abrupt ending.Dusting Coattails starts off with an hell of a guitar riff and again reels you in with a sing-a-long chorus.Marriage Incorporated is lyrically a wonderful commentary on the institution of marriage. It also boasts a most tasteful use of a theremin in rock song,without sounding cheesy.There are other winners on this CD: Pure Flesh, There She Goes Again (trademark Toby harmonies)Little Bored (clever little ditty)Jealous mantles(pure power pop)Hands and Covers(perfect harmonies)This is one beautiful cd....Buy it."
4,Comprehensive and worthwhile,"This is the companion book to ""The Solo Years"", covering Michael Jackson's recordings and performances from the Jackson 5 through early adulthood with his brothers. It's comprehensive, factual, and a great resource. There are details about when and where recordings were done, with whom, and background information on the tours and performances. It's easy to forget how much great music came out of the J5/Jacksons era. This well-written book will remind you all over again."
5,Great PPV,Now this is what I call extreme rules Brock beat the living hell out of Cena. Showing blood every once and while isn't going to hurt anyone and I'm glad Vince McMahon gave the ok. Brock and Cena wasn't the only good match on the card that night but so was CM Punk vs Jericho for the WWE Championship in a Chicago street fight. Sheamus Vs Bryan for the Heavyweight Championship was also good and the rest of the other matches. Would definitely buy on DVD.
5,Yea for Cena!!,"Personally I was sick of Lesnar the second night he showed up. After he insulted the fans that was it.I was hoping Cena would win. No, I did NOT watch the PPV. I didn't want to witness another Rock match. Talk about a ""Fixed"" Match. Okay, I won't go there, but you know what I mean:here comes another guy out of retirement who thinks he can just step into the ring after being away for years. I was so happy he lost!Yes, I will buy this PPV just to watch Lesnar get the hell beat out of him. If Triple H does it to Lesnar then I may buy that one. Now only if the WWE will wise up and let their very talented locker room show they have what it takes and let these older guys stay at home."
3,It's ugly alright,"The tag is cute with a little story about these guys always have your back (each side as a different character). It seems that most people ""collect"" these Uglydolls rather than play with them. They are interesting looking and I guess a good conversation starter."
2,Does not give off much light,I have had this light for a long time and it continues to work but it does not provide much light. The level of light it gives off is comparable to solar path lights where there is a marker but does not really provide any usable light when hung.
5,Jura Capresso Espresso machines are super!,"These tablets do their job, but what's worth writing about is the machine they are used for - they are used to clean the Jura Capresso espresso machines.When my husband calculated that I was probably spending close to $1,500 a year on lattes ! ;/ we decided it was time to invest in an espresso gadget. This is probably one of the best investments I've ever made - and it's also the most frequently used - and the most important! - appliance in the house, next to the computer! It's a wonderful machine; I've had it for over 3 years and never had a problem with it. The customer service people (on the east coast) are great too. Highly recommend these espresso makers."
4,Coffee Extraordinaire,These cleaning tablets are a must if you own a Jura coffeemaker. Every morning is a treat knowing that the coffee you just made is as delicious as the first time you used the Jura.
5,Jura Capresso cleaning tablets,"As usual, Amazon had the best price and fantastic delivery. I just love ordering anything from Amazon!"
4,A necessary evil,"The Jura machine is great but , as with all mechanical devices, you must perform regular maintanence. The cleaning tablets and the instruction booklet make this process relatively simple."
5,FUN FILM HISTORY,"This book was ordered used and it arrived on time and in good condition. I couldn't find it at local used book stores. Anyone who is interested in Otto Preminger, his son (Erick Lee Preminger), or Gypsy Rose Lee, will find much to enjoy in this - Erick's book."
4,Great Tool,"I purchased this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I am very happy with the durability, even though he will def be testing it and I will update it that happens to not be the case. But the case it self was nothing like the pictures. I loved the look of the presentation in the pictures but when I got mine I was pretty dissappointed that the tin was only big enough to display the tool. The accessories were underneith the tool display :-/ Would have been much happiter with the wider display with everything showing like in the pictures presented."
3,Did not came with Aluminum case as shown in picks.,"I have 3 different Leatherman`s for work, home, and car.I really recommend Letherman tools to everyone.Only problem with this one was that i bought this for my friend birthday.If i would know that its coming without case i would take some other model.Please take down pictures where its shown!Thank you."
5,Awesome tool,Excellent tool.....he had one several years ago that had extra tools that had to be kept in the sheath....this is ALL IN ONE !!! and so far....he LOVES IT.
5,A Must Read For Any Midwife!!!,Polly Block wrote a very practical and very in depth and descriptive book that is required reading for midwives. Track down a copy and get it!
4,Sturdy and works like described,"This camera is very sturdy and slightly large/heavy, however it works just fine like how it's suppose to. I've taken about 15 photos so far, most turn out great except sometimes if there's too much sun, the photos turn out very yellow-looking. I am not sure if this is because of the camera or simply the film I use. It also receives a lot of positive attention when I am using it in public - mainly from the older folks who start reminiscing of their childhood days using Polaroids."
4,Worth seeking out,"This cookbook contains over 100 kosher-for-Passover recipes from all over the world, so nearly everyone will find some familiar and many unusual recipes. Most recipes are preceded by notes about their origin, and nearly all are accompanied by beautiful, full-page color photos. I turn to this book whenever I want to make something out of the ordinary and have generally had excellent success, though there have been occasional duds. A few recipes include legumes, which are used by Sephardic but not Ashkenazic Jews during Passover; if you follow Ashkenazic tradition, be sure to read the ingredient lists carefully."
1,Shop worn,I bought this thinking I might give it as a gift. However when it arrived it I was disappointed. It is discolored from age and doesn't appear new. I don't think it was used but is not in excellent or even good condition.
5,A great cookbook,"This is my all-time favorite Pesach cookbook - I have been using it since it came out more than 20 years ago. I have given it as a gift numerous times, including this year, when I wrote notes next to all the recipes and gave it to a good friend, who told me that she's now actually looking forward to Pesach 2010 as she wants to try these recipes, I've been raving about all these years!"
3,You Promised Me,"I heard You Promised Me on the radio and thought that if this one cut was so good, the rest of the CD would be likewise. Wrong. I hate it when you buy a CD and only one or two songs are worth listening to."
4,Revivogen Shampoo & Conditioner - Good Product,"I've been using this product for 1 month now and I really like the results that I'm getting. Prior to using this product my hair felt thin and frail. It doesn't ""re-grow"" hair and don't expect any miracles, but it will leave your scalp feeling very healthy and clean and the remaining hair that you do have will feel more full and I believe it has slowed down the amount of hair I lose naturally on a day to day basis. Great product and I'll continue to purchase."
1,Dried out my hair,I used this product for almost two months- I have long hair. The only thing it did was completely dry out my hair. My stylist commented on how dry it was... bought it off of a website that is obviously subsidized by these products. Try Rogaine instead.
1,Yuck - wife's review,Didn't finish the bottle. Shampoo made my hair feel stripped. Conditioner was like applying oil directly to my scalp. Would never recommend.
1,Horrible product,"This is totally unexpected. I bought this early from the Revivogen official site , everything was perfect. But this time product is horrible , looks like old items...smell horrible."
1,worst product ever,"I bought a 6 month supply of this, after 4 months I chucked it and tried something new. It stained my fingers including under my nails not to mention it smelled horrible. Also - my hair loss became worst after using this - I think I would have been better off to not even have used this product. I bought the six month kit from onlyhairloss.com. Once I chucked this product I tried another which was better but still not great. I have been using Bosley for about a month now and I have already started seeing much better results. THIS PROUDUCT SUCKS AND I WOULD NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
2,Thicker feeling hair,I used this for about 5 months. Made my hair feel thicker but didn't add any hair to my head.
2,Disapointment,"Normally I like Dorcy products, but I got this package and the two smaller ones are made nice and pretty bright but the large one does not work!!...and it is flimsily made."
4,Excellent book,"I figured, what could I lose for $1.99. The book is worth far more than that. Foster includes workable and specific plans for generating ideas that are easy and enjoyable to use. I will most likely reread this book."
1,how to steal ideas,"This book may as well be a book of quotes as it contains as many quotes as an actual book of quotes. With this as inspiration one could open any book of quotes and write a book on a topic they actually know nothing about, simply quoting those who do. Perhaps it should be retitled ""how to steal ideas."""
4,"Good, Useful Book","This book provides useful techniques that could be utilised to get new ideas, however you can't get ideas by just reading a book. You don't need to be a genius, only thing required is to work harder. The author gives some real life examples that how people got good ideas. Short interesting book, easy to read and re-read."
5,Brain Surgery,"Read ""How to Get Ideas"" at your peril. It will do serious, perhaps irreversible, damage to your current way of thinking. This book is a mind-altering, uncontrolled substance that will bend and expand your brain. Probably your life, too. If you are certain that you are ready for such an experience: buy it, read it, then read it again---you may have missed something."
3,Ok book for Techniques not process for creating ideas !,"Foster wrote an ok book on idea generation, but it is not well structured and it pushes more techniques for generating ideas, not a formalized process on generating ideas. Given that I wrote my dissertation on idea generation (Google my ""name"" and ""idea generation"" to find it) I would recommend also buying other books like the ten faces of innovation or any Thomas Kelley's other books. Otherwise, I recommend buying this book because it is a quick read.Brian GlassmanPh.D in Innovation Management from PurdueInnovation ManagementCommercializationAmazon Book ReviewSee my other Innovation Book Reviews by clicking see my reviews at the top!"
2,I read everything that comes out on creativity,"I've got HOW TO GET IDEAS, and while its a nice read its far from 5-star book. I have a large library of books on creativity and can think of several books with 1000% more material on creative thinking than this book. CONCEPTUAL BLOCKBUSTING by Adams, ot anything by Michael Michalko such as CRACKING CREATIVITY. The fact that over 30 people have given this book 5 stars tells me the author knows how to create a lot if identities to plug is book. Yeah, I have an Anonymizer account too. Give me a break, this book would best be appreciated by a 10 year old. If you're serious about wanting to learn how to think creatively you can do much better than HOW TO GET IDEAS--unless you took the short bus as a kid, then this is the book for you. Very low-brow material."
3,"ok, not great",it started weak but got better. Possibly worth the time to read it.... but is long winded for a small book.
5,Smooth voice backed by a great melody and meaningful lyrics.,"Just getting into the Christian music scene and stumbled upon this up and coming artist. Wasn't too sure about this genre, but this CD pulled me in.ALL of the tracks on this CD are great, my personal favorites are #1, #2, #3, #6, & #8.God Bless"
5,These songs can change your life!!!,I was completely stunned at the amazing music and lyrics on this cd. The words were such a huge blessing to me. I highly recommend this cd to Christians and non Christians alike. I will be watching for this artist in the future and will buy his first cd FOR SURE!!!
1,Pretty Light Stuff.,"Sorry to disagree with the cheerleaders, but this is pretty light. If you like advertising jingles, this may be your speed. If you are looking for depth, this album is lacking. The vocals and instrumentation are so-so at best."
3,"Good Artist, Lousy Recording","I was really disappointed by this disk. I wanted to hear Ondar's voice, but what we have here is poorly recorded instrumentals with a singer somewhere in the background. Requires a real boost to the mid-range to get his voice to come out. I'm particularly disappointed, since both the Late Night with David Letterman Show and Millenium captured Ondar's voice very nicely. Especially Millenium - they placed Ondar in a mock-up monastery with very interesting echoes. The recording engineer here should really get some instruction.On the brighter side, this is one amazing throat singer! At one point, Ondar produces three notes at once. One does not get to hear that in everyday life.The producer has made an attempt at popular appeal by having Willie Nelson and a few others contribute to this recording. I personally think they could have saved the money - Willie's voice makes for nice vocals, but as a speaking voice, I don't think so."
4,The ideal introduction,"Tuvan throat singing is something of an acquired taste. Having said that, Ondar's willingness to bring this shamanic ritual that dates back to the Ice Age into the 21st century makes it easy to forget that odds are you won't understand a word of it (except where Willy Nelson gives us a kind translation.) We're treated to a song with banjos, an actual rap in Tuvan, and the theme from Little House on the Prairie translated. How Ondar does some of those vocal tricks, including a whistle that gave my cat a headache, is beyond me. Good place for anyone interested in the genre to get started."
1,"Too melodramatic, Voice over powered by instrumentation","I found Back Tuva Future to be melodramatic and awkward. I love the Tuvan Throat singers, including the experimental melding of their music with other cultural flavors, but was disappointed by this CD. The obvious rhythmic relation to country western music was handled with a heavy and somewhat corny hand. Ondar and his extraordinary talents were also often obscured by what sounded like movie track music. I can only assume that he has either fallen in with producers who have no empathy for the possibilities of Tuvan throat singing or he himself cannot differentiate between good innovative western music and bad.Im afraid there is no comparison to the musical quality of the Tuvan Singers, Huun Huur Tu, both in the direct traditional songs as well as the experimental mixes of ethnic rhythms and melodies. Perhaps Ondars next attempt will offer either a clearer vision or a less intrusive instrumentation."
1,"no, no, please noooo!",I can not believe the reviews on this item. There must be a lot of people who like country and western music. I really love Tuvan throat singing but i don't like country and western. This compilation was like a horrible nightmare and the destruction of all that is good about Tuva. They even have dance tunes which are so out of date they should have stuck to traditional music after all. The thought that people will buy this and think they have heard Tuvan throat singing makes me want to cry. Although it did put a smile on my face as i laughed in disbelief. I only hope that it does lead it's listeners to buying the real thing.A good introduction would be 'Shu-De Voices from a distant past' or 'Tuva: Voices from the centre of Asia' but not this - please anything but listen to this cd again!!!! Please don't make me..I'll be good!
5,Much more than a novelty,"I bought this CD with the expectation that it would be a very interesting well done recording (I know Dave Hoffner's work and I'm a Richard Feynman fan) that would introduce me to something new. What I got was much more! I got a collection of music that I play as often as any of my other favorite recordings.Ondar's singing of three notes at the same time is incredible (easy to make out on the opening to ""Two Lands, One Tribe) but the biggest surprise was how rhythmic the music is.I love this CD"
4,Amazing Audio from this Man!,"Heard this on Audio Syncs on WVXU Cincinnati. Took several listens to pick up all that was going on. Finally had to call the station, track down the CD and lock myself in a room and play it over and over. Some tracks are too busy and hard for me, and I could care less about Willie's voice. But that throat! YO!"
4,A decent recording,I love the sound of Tuvan singing but for me this cd is very listenable at the store but I doubt if i'd buy it. Anyone who likes unique styles of singing should check out the swedish artist Wimme.
4,Mixed Impressions,"After seeing Ondar on Letterman, I had to find this guy's CD. Although I appreciate the attempt by the producer to mix in an assortment of sounds and other non-Tuvian music, Ondar has such an incredible voice that any attempt to 'add' to his own music can't do anything but diminish the overall effect. It gets a 4 star from me because Ondar shredds, but I rarely listen to it because of all the other annoying crap on the CD."
2,they didn't germinate...,"I am not sure what we did wrong, must be a picky seed, they did not come up for us. Good luck to the rest of you."
5,Best conscious sex video I've seen - great techniques,"This is the best conscious sex video I've seen. It has great techniques never seen before in video or film. The ""Arts"" that it teaches are more subtle than most modern sex techniques but they pack a much more powerful punch. The basics of learning to breathe correctly can turn a non-orgasmic woman into an orgasmic one (with multiples!) and a premature ejaculator into an ""all night man""! This video is in a genre all its own. I hope more films like this will come along in the future."
1,"DVD skips, stutters and digitizes....other than that....","The content seems to look ok. However, that is when the DVD is not freezing, skipping or digitizing. It is not worth whatever I paid for this product due to the poor production quality. just move on!"
2,Ick!,"This video is full of hippie people talking about ""tantra"" like it's the holy grail. Some of it is valuable, but I couldn't stand watching the hairy armpits and ""natural"" people. A little hollywood could help these folks appeal to the mainstream. It's just icky how googly-eyed they are - very sappy!There is a lot of time spent on subjects that may not matter to you - like premature problems. Had to turn it off in the middle because the sex scenes were just nauseatingly gooey sweet and the people are way too scary looking.Here's the message of the video so far: spend at least a few hours enjoying each other once a week and set the stage with candles, music, etc. Stare into each other's eyes A LOT and go slowly. Add women with saggy and hairy parts and gray-haired mens' backs and that's the video. Now you can send me your money you just saved."
2,Not Helpful At All,I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. The preface describes this book as a book that gives you detailed descriptions of training methods so you can work with your horse. When in fact all it does is critique the training methods without actually telling you what the training methods are. I felt completely let down and wasted my money. I'm halfway through and I haven't even finished reading it and I'm making myself read on to PRAY there there is SOMETHING in this book worth reading. If you're considering getting this book - DON'T! You'd be much better off looking at who the top trainers are and purchasing THEIR books instead of this.
2,I guess I should have been happy with a damaged book,"Received a damaged book twice (second book had been banging around in a big box with no padding at all), and then an email telling me that I'd probably just be happier with a refund than to ""trouble myself"" with a third attempt at getting an undamaged book, even though I asked for a replacement. Before I even had time to disagree with Amazon's decision, the refund had been made. As if I was the problem. Shame on you, Amazon. Package your products better."
5,:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-),Thank you for the book I ordered. Its condition is 2 or 3 times better than I thought it would be. epecialy seeing its been out of print since 30 years before I was Born. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)
2,"keep shopping, ladies!","I thought the 'original looks' were bulky and heavy. I don't think there is anything comfortable about 1 pound bra insert :) they seem very dated, even the packaging!They made my bra sag, and I definitely couldn't wear them in a strapless bra, which is when I can use the most 'help'!i also bought the 'take-outs' and those bad boys are wonderful! spend a little extra and get a quality product."
2,Less than expected....,"I am a true admirer of Jacques Mayol, but this book is not as good as expected.I am not sure what was the real participation of J. Mayol, may be this work is mainly due his brother Pierre.The tale development is slow and it has a sudden end which makes little sense...If you are a fan of Mayol, may be this book has a value as itself, ...."
3,nothing great,"I bought this for g-kids to keep at my house. I thought it was slightly overpriced & shouldn't have ordered,but kids wanted."
5,they really are amazing,"this is the best most favored album of music in my room this week. i was recently the recipient of this album, and i found it to be just what i needed to turn my gray skies into blue skies. all the songs are very good, the lyrics and deep and insightful and the hamronies are more than you would find on a christmas sleigh ride. now i am waiting for the DVD of their live performances to be released in early 2007. i consider this band to be my little secret weapon against musical boredom and dennis gorksism. i highly recommend it so you buy it, and it will make you happy, which is more than i can say about anything else I own."
3,A good Attempt,"Mr Holt did a fair job at crafting this book. At least he got the basics right, but He didn't quite capture the whole spirit of the lucia series. With the original series, Benson managed to tell the story that was going on ""on stage"" but there was a great deal more that was going on behind the scenes that you would only pick up on by reading between the lines. There were lots of little things that didn't quite ring true, and it felt a little hollow. It was just a little too over the top at times. One of the things I noticed right away was the fact that Mr Wyse never seemed to take any of his usually to frequent bows.Still, it was a pleasant enough read, and I doubt anyone could ever really hold a candle to benson"
5,Great Value,Crisp and deep picture. Sony has improved picture quality with each iteration of LCD display. I have noticed the most improvement of picture quality and definition/resolution within the darker images on screen.
3,Not for those below 2000,"I got this book hoping it would help me gain a better understanding of the plans and ideas for Black in those standard Sicilian e6/d6 positions. Well, forget it. This book is little more than a catalog of recommended variations, with very little explanatory text or even illustrative games. I'm sure it's a fine book for Experts and above but if your aim is to LEARN about the Scheveningen position you should definitely look elsewhere."
2,very poorly designed,"Whoever designed this dish rack obviously has never used one before. The cutlery section isn't divided into smaller sections, so as soon as you put a utensil in to dry it falls down flat, and you can't even pick up the silverware drainer to fish it out, since it's attached to the rack! How frustrating is that? It's a pretty rack to look at, but not much good if you actually have to use it."
1,Questionable Quality,We purchased this item in May 2005 for office use. The rack and tray started rusting in the 10th week of use. We have an air-conditioned office in the business district so exposure to salt air is not a factor. Good quality stainless steel does not rust. I've used a similar American-made stainless steel rack and tray at home for the past three years which show no sign of rust and I live a mile in from the ocean. I would not recommend buying this item.
2,bad design,"The silverware section, with or without the detachable cage, is atrociously designed. Silverware either falls over or slides through to the bottom of the tray. I find it hard to believe the tray was ever tested by someone doing dishes and silverware. The tray has the single important virtue of being easy to clean, but that's the material not the design."
2,Not something we need,My wife did not like the product as it did not meet her expectation. My wife decided to get something else.
2,Don't buy,"The silverware holder is terrible; everything falls over.The ""stainless steel"" is flaking off."
3,its nice but it doesnt fit jbl 6',it says it goes with the jbl 6'but it doesnt now i will have to manufacture a piece to join both things...other than that it is really nice
4,GREAT BATMAN,My son was SOOOOOOO excited @ Christmas. We received the toy fast and in excellent condition. I truly recommended this vendor.....
5,Thanks to the United Network Command for Law & Enforcement!,"Jon Heitland delves into incredible detail about how this wonderful, trend-setting spy series came into being, later essentially destroyed itself with self-parody & camp, then tried too late for redemption. Featuring interviews with surviving crew & cast, Heitland's exhaustive research provides far more than just a sentimental journey down memory lane -- he gives insight into a pop culture icon & the turbulent generation into which it was born & helped to shape. A must for any serious U.N.C.L.E. fan, & a cracking good read even for the most casual viewer."
3,A typical 1980s TV book,"This book was published in 1987 and is obviously not a rare item, in 2004. The quality does deem it a five star but a three star at most. This book tries in itself try to do what was already attempted at a few years prior, a look at a 60s spy craze era tv series which while being the first, it was in no manner the best, with [...] yet improvised shows like I Spy, Mission Impossible and The Wild Wild West, surpassing the original in either action or realism. The last half of its 2nd year and the complete 3rd year proved its days were numbered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If it were not for this series, the above mentioned shows would certainly not have thrived! Those who praise this book too much need to realize that all books published on this series require perusal, not just this ego-inflating item."
3,Don't get taken in by regressive fanatics!,"Bought this book and read it, but found out utterly not up to level. I've seen much better! One reason for disliking this book is the lack of color photos. Buy it as a book to pass away your time, but don't bet on it as a keepsake. It ain't."
3,A look at a show that lived and died fast,"The book is mainly a desperate attempt to satisfy the author's obsession (he does not want to grow up), a book about a television program that lived fast and died hard, it could only live in the mind of anyone who denies a personal fear of aging. The gadgets in this now-primitive show are monotonous and no longer innovative--the Uzi can beat any plastic prop by a mile( and blow a copy to smithereens...)."
2,A loss leader!,"If the book is so great, why wasn't it sold off long ago? Why are there copies still left? Buy it to line your birdcage after you read it. Great indeed. Boulderdash."
2,Negative comments make sense,"Recently acquired the book, realizing its price has been upped while the material inside is dated, I read through the pages and found this series will hold absolutely no attraction to the present generation. While it may have fascinated a viewer yearning to recall his childhood in the 60s (and trying never to grow up or leave that time-period), it would never elicit even a spark from anyone of the 70s and afterward. The negative comments need to be taken seriously because their speakers have demonstrated the courage to break through the mold of steadfast starcrossed loyalty to present feasible constructive criticism.Now another negative comment must be uttered: the inflated price screams ""buy it and then sell it right away."""
5,"A ""Must Have"" book for Man From U.N.C.L.E. fans.","I found this book after my reintroduction to UNCLE fandom. I read it cover-to-cover in one night. I learned more about the show and the people behind the scenes than I had ever gleaned in the previous twenty-five years of being a fan.Jon Heitland gives a wonderful read, and his insights and anecdotes are like water to a thirsty soul. I use his book as THE reference for all things UNCLE.I can unreservedly recommend it to UNCLE fans, spy genre fans, and television buffs alike. Outstandingly researched, it is the unsurpassable MFU guide book."
4,A must for all UNCLE fans!,"Written in 1987, this is still the definitive book on the classic spy series of the 1960's. Author Heitland has clearly put together a book that gives you all of the fascinating details of a behind-the-scenes look on the show, but is also clearly interested in giving it to you in a way that keeps you interested in it's narrative. You'll find yourself wanting to watch episodes of the show with some new perspectives. The author not only knows his subject, but clearly does a great job of explaining why this show is still remembered so fondly today."
3,U.N.C.L.E. behind-the-scenes...could have been better!,A fair book describing the Man from UNCLE series...There were not enough color pictures for my taste AND it would have been nice to have pictures of the various toys that were produced for this series!
2,All wasted hype,There has been a sudden deluge of narrow-minded praises about this overhyped book which was less worthy than the preceding UNCLE Files that gave a better prespective of UNCLE.
5,Glorious voice/emotional journey,"The Other Side of Time offers not only rich and stimulating musical variety, it demonstrates the magnificent vocal range and interpretive skill of Mary Fahl. She is a woman who seems to be able to do anything with her voice-at once subtle, lush, powerful, haunting. The lyrics take me to a time out of mind where love, courage, and the pure joy of life live on and on. No kid, her songs are the stuff of life and life's reality as well as its dreams. Who doesn't want a Paolo, or to take a crazy road trip with the girls? Who hasn't faced the turmoil of Redemption or the final realization that ""noone will ever bring me down""? Finally, after we have delighted in the passion, we are held in a moment in time by her modulated, dignified tribute to courage and love. This album is about that which makes the journey so timeless and only a voice like Mary Fahl's could give it such humanity, such resonance. Buy it not to sit around with it as background music-it demands engagement."
5,Mary Fahl CD-The Other Side of Time,"Mary Fahl's voice gets better with time no matter what side of time she's on. I've been a fan since her arrival with the group ""October Project."" Her lyric s are thoughtful and her alto voice, hauntingly beautiful."
4,Emotional Voice,"Since when the founder October Project came to an end, Mary's voice was already one one of the highlights of the band. And this is proved here. A very good debut album!"
3,Style departure,"Like previous reviewers, I too was sceptical about this CD.""TheGreat Unknown"" seems to be an October Project track right off, billowing, inspiring and lush, you would never know the difference. It is my favorite. The rest of the songs really take a departure in style from what I am used to hearing from Mary. Though enjoyable, she seems to be searching for an audience. I hope she continues to put out sounds which can inspire and provoke thought in their writing without getting too sentimental. Pretty girl, great voice, don't let them change your style."
3,I'm so very very sleepy........,"Yeah, the voice is still there, to be sure....Lovely, earthy, pure goddess...but this disk is sorely lacking some rythmic drive and diversity. Where's Urbano and Emil when ya need them. October Project was truly greater than the sum of its parts, and it's kinda sad to see the results of the individual efforts be good but not great..........."
2,The Other Side of Time,"I purchased this CD as I was drawn to this woman's ""Going Home"". I think this track is wonderful. However, I found much of her other singing almost painfuly dismal. Hugely disappointed."
2,only 3 good song,"still, october proyect is the best and her voice is the best, but this cd is not the greates but think about if you like her and then buy it."
1,The DownSide of My Career,"What a disaster! Don't get me wrong, I LOVED Mary Fahl in her October Project incarnation. But, where should I start with this new material? Trite......calculated.....so overproduced that I am afraid the focus groups are still on-going in some mall in Wisconsin. If you are October Project fan, steer clear of this.Goes to show you what happens when great singers lose access to the writers of their best material."
5,A treasure for the world to find,"I have followed Mary Fahl's career since her years with October Projectand I have always been touched by the depth and grandeur of her glorious talent.This solo CD is truly a magnificent body of work.Mary's voice has a way of infusing one's spirit with magic and reverence.Whenever I try to describe to someone who has yet to experiencethis majestic artist I tell them, ""If a mountain range could sing, it wouldsound like Mary Fahl""."
5,A true masterpiece!,"Come on folks, buy this CD first and read this later...I have an amazing story about how did I discover Mary. I new one of her songs from the radio but didn't knew it was October Project. I was impressed with her voice and tried to find out the CD in the best Lisbon stores with no results. Should have no luck as I did have not even a name...Then I saw Mary's beautiful face on Windows Media Player's multimedia guide, promoting this new album. It was just a click and with luck I discovered the voice I searched for years. Now I know it's virtualy impossible to find OP CD's in Portugal so I bought this and the first OP album right here at amazon.com and, belive me, no one paid me to write this lines...Still didn't get it in my mail box but I've heard ererything thanks to a free sample on Mary's web site. The sound quality of the sample is far from any good, but the work is superb, beautiful and gives me the peace and pleasure of listening I need.A true masterpiece!"
5,"Wow!, A beautiful listening experience!",The entire album is amazing. Mary Fahl has one of the most ethereal voices I have ever heard. I am glad that this album came out as I have been wanting more since I fell in love with her voice when she sang with October Project. Looking forward to her next album.
5,Sensual Woman,"If you're old enough to have appreciated the singing of Julie London, you will fall in love with the sensual lyrics of Mary Fahl. The range of her voice reflects that of an experienced woman rather than the superficial renditions that you might hear from singing artists who rely too much on musical gimmickry. I could listen to her all day."
5,great horn and great service,"Solid horn especially for the price range!!! Great service... They don't have a phone number, but if you contact them via email, they will get back to you the same day.Intonation problems on a few notes, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a Tenor that's less than 300$... The keys feel good, the corks are great, pads are nice... As long as you take care of this horn, it will take care of you.I would definately buy again."
4,It's decent for the price,It's decent for the price. Its not something that you would get if you plan on being a professional but it does get the job done. It doesn't feel cheap and the color of the metal is nice. It has an okay sound but nothing spectacular or amazing about it and it will sound nice if you put some effort to do so.Shipping was sooner than I expected so that was a pleasant surprise.
1,Defective Item!,Poorly made product. Arrived with pieces fallen off and missing. Took it to local music shop and after putting it together there were air leaks around valves so he could not play the scale right. The investment to make it right was around $70 and he predicted we would need frequent repairs. Now I'm fighting with the company for a refund. Avoid this product. My experience was bad.
4,Good,"I bought this saxophone for my husband; he use to play in high school and he wanted to see if he still had it in him. well he was very pleased with the apperence of it and he liked the case it came in. As for the quality of the sound he said it was good overall for the price except that it was hard to play the lower b flat key. I gave it 4 star because of that issue my husband had with the key, but all in all it arrived just in time for Christmas which made me very happy after purchasing it less then a week before."
4,the mixes,"a rare find- tina's australian remix ep from 1984. Typical extended 80's mixes of 5 private dancer singles ,including ""show some respect""(although ""let's stay together"" is the same as the album version), plus ""it's only love "" live .nice to have for tina collectors , but not worth it for a casual fan! nice sleeve of tina in classic 80's denim jacket / leather dress.I say , buy it!"
5,Excellent buy!,I love this workout because it's a little different than what I normally do. This is a very easy to follow conditioning routine and Beth Shaw is just so encouraging and explains everything very well.
5,Reading on our way through the San Juans,My husband and I just returned from our annual boat trip to the San Juan Islands. While we were on Patos ( a favorite stop) we were happy to find the lighthouse open and manned by the volunteers there. They suggested this book and it delighted us all during our trip. We read to each other on the beach at Indian Cove (Shaw Island) Fishermans Bay ( Lopez Island) and finished on Spencer Spit. It was a joy to have the story of the Patos lighthouse keepers family come alive through the eyes of this adventurous young girl.. Tears and laughs. I will be gifting this book to my 12 year old granddaughter as I know she also will be enriched by the story.
4,Great recipes that taste great!,"Besides being a cook book, Jenny talks with you about a nutritional lifestyle and suggestions for dealing with temptations of eating very fattening foods.I have tried some of the recipes and my husband did not know that he was eating something that besides being good tasting was also good for him."
2,I guess you get what you pay for,"I'm now shopping for a different phone. Lack of backlighting on the caller id box makes it very hard to read caller id. There is consistent background noise while using the phone and the other party sounds like they are down a tunnel and can barely hear me either. The price was great, but the phone simply doesn't meet minimum standards."
1,bad news,this phone was listed with lcd back lite and dial pad lite.it has no lites and you can't see the number in the lcd.for this price i expected more but got less. do not wast your time unless you have a well lited room.
2,Caller ID doesn't work in my country,The caller ID doesn't fit the my country's system and Vtech doesn't expose theirs. Besides it has a continuous noise during normal local calls.[Poor] quality phone !!
3,Didn't last long!!!,Had this phone for only 8 months before it started to fail. Doesn't hold charge very long either
4,VTech VT9123,"This phone is a great buy!! The operation of this phone is amazingly easy. To talk you press talk, etc. It seems that when programing numbers into the directory that there is no limit to how many you can input. Programming is also easy. All you have to do is press program, select and input the name and phone number of the person you want to have in the memory.The quality of sound on this phone is pretty good. The phone also has a selection of different ring tones which is cool. I think that this is one of the best deals on a 900mhz phone that you will find."
2,Looks a lot bigger than it is.,If you want a big tea ball I suggest you look at the 3 inch tea balls. I use it for fruit based tea so the tea is basically dried fruit chunks which are bigger than ground tea. The tea ball is around two inches in diameter so when you open it you only have one inch to put your tea in. I just have trouble getting enough tea in this to work for me.
5,Great for Indian-style masala chai!,"Put in the ginger, spices and tea leaves into the infuser, and throw it into the boiling water. One infuser can hold enough stuff to make 3-4 cups of tea. Easy to clean."
3,Good for pitchers.,"I was going to use this to make 2 c. of tea in my coffee mug. However, it really didn't fit well in it. It would fit well in a pitcher tho, and there was no problem with the way it clasped together or cleaned."
4,Simple and easy to use.,"I bought this because my wife and I love to make roasted corn tea, something we grew fond of after several trips to our favorite Korean restaurant. We bought a large bag and started boiling our own tea in the comfort of our home. When we put them in the water, the corns just float on the top. After boiling them for several minutes, the corn starts to sink but also starts to break apart when they are thoroughly soaked. With this little gadget, we can put 3 tablespoon inside the little cage and they stay under. You also have no need to grab a strainer as everything stay snugly inside except for the very minute morsels.This infuser is made of stainless steel. A hook is attached to the end of the chain so you can hang it at the side of the pot. Chain is long enough to accommodate taller pots. This is big and intended mainly for use in pots; not for personal single servings. Very simple gadget and very easy to use. Made in China for RSVP, USA."
3,Used it to make Turkey Stock,"It worked well with fresh herbs and peppercorns. However, I've only used it once and I'm concerned that it may not last long as the bottom connection seems rather flimsy. It was nice not to have to fish out all the herbs and peppercorns from the finished stock. Works well so far. Just concerned about the quality. Could have been made a little more sturdy."
5,No more picking out lemongrass!,"Got this for using lemongrass in dishes. Adds the flavor, but no picking (or spitting) out the lemongrass. I'm sure it will work for bay leaves as well."
4,Great Alternative,"This product is a great, reasonably priced and neater alternative to cloth bags for infusing the flavor of herbs in soups and stews."
4,Wish the mesh was a little tighter,"I do like this, but for finer/smaller tea, some of it escapes through the mesh. I bought this to use in a tea pot since it's bigger, and it is good for that. Easy to open."
3,"Delicious, but don't ship well","These are delicious crackers, but don't ship well, and many end up broken in the process."
4,Cracked Crackers,Sesmark Savory Thins. This is one of the few snack products without saturated fat that goes well with nonfat soy/cheese. The price from Amazon is about half that of the local market. The problem is that many of the packets in the case came with many cracked(broken)crackers; no pun intended. I will give it one more try.
1,Delay,I have not received this book yet. Its been 3 weeks now since I purchased this book online. Please follow this up and let me know the reasons for the delay.Thank you
5,Wonderful book,"One of my childhood favorites. I wanted to give it to my grandchildren, but it was so worn, I had to buy them a new book. The Glob was probably my earliest introduction to the concept of evolution. I highly recommend!"
2,What????,"I do not own this box set, but I remember most of these songs. This cd set seems to be ok, and may satisfy some. But how can you title a Metal Cd Set as ""Youth Gone Wild"", and not include Skid Row's song ""Youth Gone Wild"" on it? The song ""Youth Gone Wild"" is one of the best rock anthems from the 80's ever written.This is like another Cd compilation I've seen before. It was a compilation of power ballads from the 80's like ""Every Rose has its Thorn"" as so forth. It was titled ""Love Bites"", yet it didn't include the #1 hit power ballad by Def Leppard entitled ""Love Bites"". These record companies need to learn how to select songs that go on an album."
4,Good XM Radio,"PROs: The design is compact and sleek. The menu structure is easy to follow. Sound quality is good.CONs: While the Inno has a built-in FM Modulator, this feature is only available on the menu when docked in the ""optional"" Car Kit (for $50+). Additionally, as far as I can tell, it is not compatible with i-tunes (only Napster)."
4,Good but has some short comings,"I have used the GEX INNO2BK for about 4 years. I ""upgraded"" form a different car add-on system.I like the portability which allows me to listen to xm when I am mowing lawn (I have the optional, and very uncomfortable, antenna headset) I can also easily move from my car to my Jeep. I do like the ability to record songs, but most of the songs are cut off in the beginning or the end or both. It reminds me as a kid trying to tape record songs from the radio.I do have the optional car kit which has a weak FM modulator. It is easily over rode by surroundin broadcasts. This never happened with my old system.The GEX-INNO2BK is ""almost there"". I like it but would switch to a different model if it could fix the concerns listed above"
2,not so great,"I purchased this to replace my roady XT because of it's smaller size and easier portability. I wanted to use it while walking or doing yard work. The reception is poor at best. I've even tried placing it in a holder on the dash in the car but anytime you go under a powerline or by trees, you lose reception. It has to be hooked to the wired antenna or you will be disappointed with the reception. Also, the remote that came with the unit doesn't work. I have contacted the seller and Pioneer. The seller tells me that it is up to Pioneer for warranty work and Pioneer tells me that the seller is not one of their authorized dealers so they will not replace it. Very frustrating. Also, everytime I have tried to contact Pioneer, I have had a 15 - 20 minute wait to speak with anyone. I will definately not purchase any Pioneer products in the future."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I purchased this with the intention to be able to record shows, music, etc. and the reception was aweful. The only way this would work is if you live in a very rural area. Seeing as I live in the city I had hoped this would work out, but it never did. I'd have two bars of service and it would cut out, even while I was on the train platform. This needs to be a device that can really be used ""anywhere."" I sent it back and canceled my XM service after a week. Nice try Pioneer, but you just didn't give it the power to perform the way you say it should."
1,"Device works great, LEATHER CASE IS JUNK!","The device works great, read elsewhere about good reviews of XM. I love XM.My problem is the leather case.It's too tight, so the button holding the device inside may come undone and the device falls out, causing said device to break.This just happened to me.It kept trying to power up, finally it came onI powered it down then turned it on again, it appears to be working ok now.Use a different leather case, that won't let the device fall out.One star review from me, because if it breaks because of the case, then I wasted my money."
2,No signal,"I have XM IN my Honda and it works great anywhere I go so I bought the Inno thniking I could get satellite at home. The Inno gets a very weak to no signalat home either with the unit antenna or with the supplied esternal antenna. I've tried going outside and pointing the external in all directions to no avail. The inno works great in downtown San Antonio, but not in the burgs. Is there any way to test the signal or a website that gives this kind of signal strength information before you buy?"
1,GEX-Inno 2BK satelite radio,"This item item was purchased from Electronics-Expo on June 29, 2011, it was advertised as new and the last one in stock. When I received the item, on July 7, it was obvious this was not a new unit. It was either a used or returned item. The plastic packaging was open, the battery had been installed, there was no docking unit and the cords had been unwound. I called customer service, was emailed a return authorization number , and returned the item following the companys instructions. The item was received by the company on July 19th. I was advised it would take 7 to 10 business days to receive my refund. After a series of phone calls and emails I finally received a full redund on August 17th, almost a full month from the date the company received the item. I will not do business with this company again not will I recommend it to friend or family. Buyer Beware!"
4,great sound,"Hi;I have owned the Inno2BK for over a month and can say the unit works great in my house and the car using the home holder/charger. I bought an external antenna, a monster cassette adapter, and a 12 volt charger that plugs into the home unit so that I can listen to the xm in my car. As for walking, the sound does fade if the unit is ubstructed by the mountains. The headphone antenna make a big difference or you can just reposition for alot less. For that reason I gave the unit 4*s.I haven't had any trouble with Sirius XM Radio company yet. I signed uo for the monthly charge at $15(inc. tax)."
2,Kills my car battery!,It kills my car battery if I leave it turned on. Don't buy unless you want to record your XM programs. The Only reason it hasn't been replaced.
4,XM Inno,I bought the XM Inno for my husband as a gift. He already had XM radio in his truck and he really enjoys it. He equally enjoys the Inno especially because of it's portability. He also likes the record feature.
1,"Not impressed, Disappointed",The Reception on this is very poor. The channels kept fading in and out. This radio didn't work for me.
3,wired connection through AUX port on car radio,"Well, from all I've read about this product on different sites, it would seem that the only way to connect it to your car radio is by using the sureconnect kit that consists of a transmitter that transmits via radio signal to your car radio.Take it from me, it's a pain in the butt and never works well.You'll travel 5 miles and have to set the Inno to another empty station until the next incoming radio signal from outside overwhelms the unit.Would it kill them to provide a port on the Inno so I can plug into the AUX port on my car radio?Shouldn't this be standard?A real ""no brainer""!I'll be looking for another product..."
5,Pioneer XM Gex-Inno Portable - The best !!,"What a great way to enjoy XM !Now I can listen to XM Satellite between the the home and the car, without losing the end of my favorite song, and without missing one lap of action of IndyCar or NASCAR action. WhooHoo!This compact radio allows you to listen to XM while on the go.No need to connect or re-connect between the home and the car or the car and the home.Just plug your favorite headset into it and listen to it anywhere!"
5,For easy security camera hook up! This cant be beat!,"Not much to say about this product , other than, it works great and you will need it for easy camera installation Thanks!!"
4,security camera cable,Great product. Was using regular co-ax but this is easier to feed through smaller holes as the wire is much thinner.
2,50 ft pre-made -- limited use only!,"Video terminates in an RCA plug. If you need to use the BNC adapter, good luck. it doesn't stay tight.Power side is only a 28AWG - WAY too thin, particularly for 12VDC; there's simply too much voltage drop.These cables are good for doing an on-site demo, or trade show. Don't consider these for a permanent production environment."
5,Interesting history,This book is very interesting and covers an event that most Americans don't know anything about. It is rich in detail.
4,THE EARTHQUAKE AMERICA FORGOT,This is an excellent book about the New Madrid (MO) earthquake of 1811-1812. There are many stories from the time and pictures of homes that were damaged or destroyed.
2,paul spaeth's 101 variations on the Titanic theme,"Ive hear this Cd a million times. Its good if your a vegetable and you enjoy music that makes you feel like a vegetable. This music, though well written, has almost no substance to it. I swear the main theme to the movie titanic is played at least 3 times in the cd that ive counted. This music gives me a severe headache. If you like music that is like kenny G on prozac you should buy this cd, but if you like music with an edge you should buy something else."
2,I just dont see it,"Bottom line, Cobalt Blue is not very good. I was not impressed. I agree with one reviewer who said it was ordinary, that is very much true. I didnt hear anything ravishing or outstanding on this cd. I think maybe Spaeth over did it with the melodies which sounded kind of replicated. I'm suprised to see that so many people actually thought that this was 5 stars. Obviously they feel like they have to be nice and warm to a young musician. You must take a look at the whole picture and this one is surely incomplete."
3,Heading in the right direction - but a way to go,Would have enjoyed it more if the piano were tuned and the string players a little more proficient.
2,Immature Work,"This work was released prematurely. Paul Spaeth has not reached a point where his compositons sound professional.However, he does have some wonderful melodies (even though he does not play around with them and surprise the audience). I would also have liked to hear some vocals or lyrics added to these compositions.Mr Spaeth will no doubt make a name for himself later in life. I look forward to his next CD to see if he has some attained some maturity in his work.I recommend this CD for anyone who likes Celtic Music."
2,Not Terribly Great,"I downloaded the Tribute to the Lord of the Rings, and, sadly, 'tis rather plain. In all honesty, my very good friend- a freshman in high school- writes better music. I suppose that I mustn't judge such a beginner so harshly, but really, he needs to work on more complex compositions. Spaeth needs to push the boundaries and develop his creativity a little more before he produces a cd."
2,The music is just too simple,"This cd has very little significant meaning,music wise. The melodies are very simple and plain. Don't get me wrong simple melodies can be just as beautiful as complex ones. But this recording was just too simple. I think Spaeth is going in the right direction with his music but it lacks the power of emotion. This would be a good learning tool for those who are just starting to write their own music."
2,Certainly not a masterpiece,I dont know if this is anywhere near what I thought it might of been. I give some credit to Paul Spaeth for his effort but I felt like this was not a recongizable composition. I think that Spaeth has a little more learning and growing to do before he makes another album. The reason I say this is because I dont believe that Spaeth right off the bat should of made an album while still being educated. The melodies on this cd are pretty simple and you can almost guess 100% of the time what the next note or pitch will be. I would give this artist several more years before making a descent and more authentic album.
1,What's the big deal???,"Is this James Horner's mini-me or what?? Spaeth has no originality what so ever. This cd was a huge let down. I thought that the music would be something new and different but it sounds to me like he listens to ""titanic"" way too much. I enjoy instrumental albums, especailly film scores but I heard nothing special here, I'm sorry to say. A disapointment no doubt."
2,Thumbs Down,"I bought this game thinking it might be similar to one I had played in the past with UNO cards (we called it SPAZ). The concept was the same and I had high hopes, but this game just didn't work for us. Depending on the cards showing in the middle, you are supposed to made certain sounds ... with everyone going at once and the sounds able to be in any order, it was simply impossible to tell who had completed the task correctly/first. Even when we had one person not participate, but just be a judge, it didn't work. The kids were very unimpressed ... and I'll be racking my brain to try and remember the rules to SPAZ, which used hand movements in a particular order and therefore wasn't subject to the same problems ... and doesn't require the purchase of new cards. Thumbs down for this game."
3,Fairly straightforward documentary of an attempt to climb Cho Oyu (8210m) in 2000,"Documents the 2000 expedition of 21 climbers attempting Cho Oyu from the Tibet side.The story line is fairly straightforward following the team driving from Kathmandu to Tibet Base Camp, trekking to ABC, and then the climbing to the camps on the mountain. I liked the filming, giving me a better appreciation for Cho Oyu, especially the challenge of the rock step on summit day. It nicely highlights the ordinary challenges of attempting high altitude climbing, things like trouble acclimatizing, stomach troubles, coughing, and snow blindness.On October 3, 2000 Tim Boelter, Expedition Leader Dan Mazur, and Durge Tamang reached the true 8201m summit of Cho Oyu. On October 10th the team helped an exhausted Serbian climber, who was suffering from pulmonary edema, down from Camp I. The rescue turned out sadly when he died when his heart went into fibrillation."
2,cho oyu,This is basically a list of medical facts. Everybody is sick in this movie.Rather boring. sorry.
3,"The Longest, I've found","I selected this hose because it was the longest I could find. So far its working okay, but I did come across two challenges. One, the coil of the hose is very tight and when I do attempt to stretch it across the room it becomes a little clumsy. Second, the part of the hose that connects to the sink faucet needs to be stiffer. If I pull too hard the hose bends cutting off the water pressure."
2,disappointing adventure,"The rave reviews by Amazon prompted me to order this book. I am, however, very disappointed in the story. Maybe something got lost in the translation of the story from Swedish because the plot is disjointed. I don't know how a toddler is supposed to make sense of it. The illustrations are wonderful and clearly the best part of the book."
1,WAit a second now,"If these are the original new York State Recreation Circulars (Mulholland wrote several as the Assistant Commissioner for Lands and Forests), running in several editions and refered to as Recreation Circular #9, there's NO WAY this is worth the outrageous asking price. If you want a copy, several hundred exist in local libraries in the Catskills, where you can get a photocopy for about 5 bucks. Also...these are old, and lots of info is no longer accurate. I own about 50 of these books, and would never dream of charging so much for them. And, if they're reprints, as I see they are, then they don't even have antique value. Beware."
1,F03 Sulfated Battery Error,"I had one of those produced by Vector before Black and Decker takeover. Its a great unit while it worked. One Day just after two years of purchased it and used about twenty times (Just keeping my Boat Batteries charged), the unit started with an F03 error meaning the Battery was bad. Not sure it was the Battery, I tested the charger in three other Batteries all with the same F03. Called Black and Decker for Warranty Support. The first thing was they asked if I keep the Original Purchase Receipt. That was It, No Receipt No Warranty, no matter I had the Credit Card Statement showing the purchase of $69.00 at Pep's Boys. That was the end. The Rep told me ""That's why you must staple the receipt to the Manual.Will never buy from Black and Decker again!"
1,i see only F03 on Black and Decker model VEC 1095ABD after 8-9 months of normal use,"I have the black & decker unit with an F03 problem (model VEC 1095ABD). It has worked well for about 8-9 months, but now it shows only the F03 on any battery (including ones that are operating normally and are charged). I am very disappointed with this unit and it has turned me off from black & decker. The unit is made by a 3rd party OEM (Vector Manufacturing). Previously I owned a Schumacher and it worked well for 10+ years before it was accidentally broken. Anyway, I am going back to Schumacher!"
1,Junk wrapped in pretty plastic,I bought this unit to charge my deep cycle house batteries as well as my starting battery for my boat.I know my batteries are in good shape...just wanted to top them off for winter. I followed the instructions to the tee and the unit just kept flashing between error code F03 and 000. This says that the batteries are sulfated (which I know they are not). It would not charge any of my batteries. I tried to call black and decker for technical support....um....lets just say I would have had better luck asking my 6 year old.I returned the unit and bought a less expensive schumacher model 1500 which started working right off.I also called Trojan Battery [Great Company] and asked them for recommendations for chargers....the person I spoke to listed several. Black and Decker was not on the list.
1,"Junk.......VEC1095ABD...more B&D junk, junk, junk",Maybe I'll post a video review too so you can see it for yourself. Had this two years & warranty just expired. Doesn't mater what battery I put it on. It just comes up F03- Sulfated condition. 1st I'm out the $80 that I paid for the junk-charger plus I'm out $80 that I just paid for a new battery. It's winter in Chicago and I didn't want to take chances with an unreliable battery. Too bad I got stuck with an unreliable-junk charger!
1,"Well-designed, but poor quality. Failed","This would be a five star review if the thing kept working. I loved it and found all the features useful and effective.Alas, it was not to be. The first one failed, and the dealer would not help me, so I sent it back to BD. They sent me a refurb which was intermittent, so back it went. 2 months later, I got another refurb from them. So far, so good. Maybe the third time will be the charm.UPDATE: A year and a half later.....The third time is not the charm. The fan is super noisy and grindy, and it takes several tries to get the charger to charge."
5,Best battery charger,"I had a smart charger before.It was 12yrs old & between me pulling it off the self 9-10 times & my grandson pulled it off his car to the garage floor. i guess it was one time to many. I had to have another just like it, takes care off my boat battery & quick starts who ever left their dome lights on all night. plus can check the output off alternator & qive an old battery a shock treatment to give it life a little longer. I have had many chargers in the last 40 yrs. This is the best one I've ever had. automatic, just plug & go , it tells you it's full & shuts off. I couldn't find another like it here in town so this was my 1st perchase on the internet. Thanks Amazon for delivering it so fast !"
3,OK while it lasted,Had this for about a year used it last week to start my diesel pickup when it was cold worked like a charm. Got it out this week to charge the battery on my riding mower and would not come on. No lights No fan nothing just a hunk of plastic and metal with 3 cords hooked to it gonna try to get replaced wish me luck I guess I want to replace it not very happy with it just dying when will it happen next time when I really need it I imagine!!!!
2,Garbled error code,"Lasted about 1 1/2 years with low usage. The display now has a partial error code displayed. Always stored in a dry area, so it didnt get wet at any time."
1,Crap,"I had this same exact one in the vector name. This is a total piece of crap it worked maybe 4x then all i got was 2 error codes either bad connection or bad battery like an error code e04 or f04. Even on batterys i knew was good the dam thing still showed these error codes..""Total piece of crap"" Best to stick to non computerized models of battery chargers in my opinion."
3,Slippery When Wet,"Grinds well, but top gets slippery and hard to turn when your hands are wet or greasy."
3,It's OK,"The screw that controls grind fineness becomes loosened as you grind, so you constantly have to adjust it as you grind. Grind volume is OK, but not great. I bought it because it was cheap and it's clear so you can see how much peppercorn you have left. But there are probably better grinders out there."
5,reliable mill,"This is a great second pepper mill. It comes with white pepper in it which is exactly what I use it for. I have a main pepper mill with black pepper but this one is so good at grinding I may get a larger one of these for black pepper. Very easy to fill and adjust the grind, too."
3,Average,"I'm not thrilled, but I'm not unhappy either. It seems to be working fairly well, and doesn't do a bad job grinding. I prefer the grinders with the settings for grind level, so I probably won't buy this type again."
2,Not quite what I though it was.....,"This is book is not about what I thought it was going to be about. This book is an autobiography about a woman that has traveled the world. Good for her, but I can't afford to travel the world to connect with the divine feminine. There are much better books out there on how to connect with the Goddess that are NOT autobiographies. I think the title is very misleading."
4,Rinérse '- Mes Vacances A Rio,"The summery MES VACANCES A RIO gets a tropical house rub from Franois K, which manages to make the track both energetic and mellow at the same time, retaining the perky digital melody but adding a tinge of melancholy as well as some vocals from Barbara Mendes. Mr. Mongk, though, pushes the beats forward for a deeper mix. Time for another vacation!"
3,PRETTY GOOD,"Although I havent bought this album, I did download a few songs. The songs I downloaded I thought were really good. In this album they use catchy house grooves and basslines."
5,It's been a LOOOOONG Time,"It's been along time since I had this back in my collection. I have to say that all the LP's I have back in the day, you have them all. As soon as I get my full list together I'm gonna holler back PEACE Oliver."
5,A complete treatise,"When you work in other field and want to have a complete image of what astrophysics is, but do not have enough time for read more than two hundred pages, then this book is for you. It uses the mathematical language that make it a serious treatise and covers a fine range of actaul knowledge."
5,"Intelligent, entertaining, extremely learned yet readable...","In the flood of psycho-spiritual babble books, this one is a quiet winner. Like the magazine Gnosis which the authors edited and published for many years, this book is intelligent and well-balanced and shines a much-needed light on musty areas of Western spirituality. I found it very useful, especially the annotated bibiography for each subject - sufism, Gurdjieff, alchemy, shamanism, etc. And where else would you find out the real reason why Hitler didn't invade England...? Highly recommended!"
4,"Excellent resource, but lots of Jung","Excellent resource to have on hand if you're exploring the many mystery traditions out there. One of the best ones I've read in that it tries to present each tradition positively and more or less objectively. The authors try to find ways to explain at least a part of most of the systems in Jungian terms, which gets a little old if you don't think that Jung has the best system around - but the histories, facts and stories are well worth reading. Having so many traditions described in one volume is great!"
4,Jay Kinney wrote the better parts,"Writer Jay Kinney did a better job of writing than Smoley in this book, but the book overall is informative, well written and very interesting.There is a bit of an ""I love the Golden Dawn magical stuff"" going on and I can't personally stand Crowley...so in that regard the book was a miss and I knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars for the Crowley love.Crowley was an idiot who took advantage of people. Any genius he found, he did so by accident or from stealing ideas.Buy this book, you will enjoy it and you will be well informed for it. Ignore any positives about Crowley and you are on your way."
3,Does not work for SW20/91-94 MR2,"The product is of fine quality, and works fine for vehicles it fits i'm sure, but if you own a 91-94 mr2, with the premium sound option, this will not work for you. You can tell by looking at your factory radio plug, if its a 14 or 15 pin plug, this product will not work. If you want to use stock speakers and amplifier, there is another converter available from metra that has the 15 pin layout."
5,Great buy,Wiring harness made the radio install to my 4Runner as smooth process. Directions were great and worked like a chrarm.
5,Metra 70-1761 Radio Wiring Harness For Toyota 87-Up Power 4 Speaker,The cord (wiring) did the job it was asked to do. The whole transaction was great with no problems at all.
5,Worked great with my 2011 Scion Xd,"The ""will it fit"" thing on Amazon said this wouldn't work with my 2011 Scion Xd. It was wrong. This was exactly what I needed and it worked great. Anytime you're replacing the factory stereo you should pick the proper wiring harness so that you don't have to cut your car's wiring."
3,Doesn't fit 2003 Matrix XLS,"The harness looks fine, but I wanted to note that it's not the right one for the 2003 Matrix in case that helps someone else save some time."
5,Recommended to make installation very easy.,"Do you like splicing wires in the car? I don't. This harness made the install very simple. The color codes were a perfect match. I was able to sit inside the house, nice and warm, then after the harness was spliced into the new stereo I spent about thirty minutes inside the car installing the new unit. SIMPLE!"
3,Works as promised; remember to order additional harnesses,"This harness works for power, switched power, ground, powered antenna, left and right front speakers. However, the kit does not include the left and right rear speakers. When you order this and your Toyota Tacoma has rear speakers, remember to order the harness for those speakers. If it was supposed to come with the rear speaker harness (as photographed), then I didn't receive it.In any event, the harness allows you to connect the wiring to your new head unit outside of your vehicle, so you can solder the connections for better quality and strength (over crimp or splice)."
5,Nice.,"Super easy. I do check the reviews prior to purchase. Some guy complained about the black lead being live, but not according to my Camry and not according to most online diagrams. Oh well."
5,Works fine for 2001 Camry,"Used to install a Pioneer DEH-1200MP radio in my 2001 Toyota Camry. Works just fine!! Wish the ground was longer and had a connector already attached , but I'm just being nit picky. Colors on the wires matched up perfectly with the colors on the radio, and the harness hooked right up to the connectors in the car. A lot cheaper than paying $22 to Bestbuy and adding $50 for installation! Thanks Metra and Amazon!"
4,Metra 70-1761 Radio Wiring Harness for Toyota 87-Up,Ended up not needing this because the head unit I replaced was after market. This would have worked just as well. I am including a review because I liked that Amazon recommended it as an add-on and for just a few dollars it would have saved me considerable frustration. Now I have a spare. Sometimes when you don't think you need it you might because the existing one may need replacing. I would recommend to a friend.
1,Doesn't fit all Toyota 87-Up,"I own a 2000 Toyota 4Runner SR5 and this Wiring Harness does not work. I even typed in my vehicle type on Amazon to make sure it ""works with my vehicle"" but unfortunately when I took out the stock stereo there was a different connection. I have since reordered a Toyota 20 pin wire harness to see if it will work, even though it is not recommended by Amazon, but looks exactly like the one I need. I would recommend removing the stock stereo first prior to ordering. I will complement Amazon on the prices though as this cost me $3.75 online and would have cost $19.99 at Best Buy.Update: The Metra 70-8113 Toyota 20 pin, that I ordered after the Metra 70-1761, ended up fitting perfect. It even states on the packaging for the 70-8113 that it is for Toyota 2000 and up. Good quality and no issues."
1,Does Not Fit the Highlander,"Although the package clearly says works on a 2001 Highlander it DOES NOT. I called there support and they said ""yea, we know that most Highlanders before 2002 it does not fit"" Then why do the advertise this?Walmart had one that fits for $4.00 - get that one."
4,stylistic pleasure,"Great read, VT can certainly turn a phrase. She was a stylish and witty writer. I enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed this book. What a life!"
3,They're okay,"The magnets on this set sucks and they're smaller than my vise (i knew that purchsing tho). I bought them for the grooves to hold dowels and pipes, unfortunately if you put TOO much pressure on them they slip off the vise and will drop your parts. What do you expect out of something for this price?"
3,awkward clamping,"these jaws have a recessed face so when the vise is closed, the top portion of the jaws aren't touching. Makes the jaws flex inward. Like I said, awkward."
4,gotta have it!,Creative . . . a must have on the shelf! Just order it . . . why don't cha?This book is very fun. I really appreciate the thought that went into this!
5,Makes a great gift!,"I sent this to my sister who loves, loves, loves cheese. She's picky about it too, having lived in Italy for several years. She said this was an awesome gift and the cheeses are divine. I'm thinking about ordering one for myself!"
3,Hardly informative about CW Naval battles,"Overall, this book is a disapointment on the subject though I suppose it does have its uses for those interested in the subjects. A lot of the material, especially the illustrations, appear to be borrowed."
3,"Nice dance, lousy excuse for music",This is all very good choreography very much based in ballet and not digressing far from classical dance. John Cage's music however sounds like me snoring. Since the two artists collaborate by chance and the dancers never hear the music until they perform the piece I suggest you turn the sound off and take a chance on playing some music you like while watching the dancers. I tried it out with some music by Scriabin orchestrated by Nemtin called Nuances now unavailable unfortunately and it worked pretty well.
1,Pass on this one - low quality,"Well, I thought that this was a good deal - wrong! It's truly a poorly designed label maker. It's bulky and hard to use. The instruction manual claims that this unit makes ""high quality"" labels. I found that the lables where poorly aligned and of poor print quaility. Pass on this one!"
2,Dymo Doesn't Meet Expectations,"The LabelManager was an item that I definitely needed and wanted for both home and work. However, the LabelManager does not even come close to being easy to use so for the most part, I don't use it as much as I hoped. One of the first problems I had, was the unit required 8 batteries or an AC adapter. I installed 8 BRAND NEW Energizer batteries and the unit still would not work until I used a spare AC adapter. The second problem is the awkward design of the key pad which makes it hard to type. Third, and most frustrating is that the labels do not peel away from the backing very easily. And after typing up 47 labels, I DO NOT have the patience to sit and struggle with peeling difficult labels. All-in-all, I prefer the Brother P-Touch!!"
4,Labels for [people],Dymo has created a wonderful addition to my office. This handy little item makes labels as fast as I can type. A great item for home or office use.
5,Absolutely wonderful for all levels of Pilates,"Others have gone into great detail why this is such a great book, but the thing I really found useful is that it not only shows you what to do, it shows what you look like when you're doing an exercise improperly. Not everyone learns well from anti-patterns, but I found the pictures of the right and wrong ways to do an exercise especially helpful.I'm currently on my third copy of this book- not because it has worn out, because I keep giving to other people as a gift. It really is the best available book for learning how to do Mat Pilates exercises. It's not only well written, it's also well designed and well edited, with great layout and indicies."
5,My Pilates Bible,"Pilates is a gift to the body and this book wraps it all up without any unnecessary elements. Author Ungaro has done a brilliant job deciding what features are key to learning the complicated system of Pilates. I have done no more than follow along with this book several times a week and I feel better than I have in 15 years. My body awareness has been heightened. My posture was immediately improved and just this morning in the shower I was able to touch my toes. Something I could never do, even as a child. If you are looking for a book to guide, encourage and inspire you, I strongly recommend this book. The instructions are short and clear, the photos are exact and precise and the charts really help to visualize the system as a whole. Pilates: Body in Motion has become my Pilates Bible. If you have a friend or family member that you care about, get them this book. I bought several of these as holiday gifts this season and everyone loved them!!"
5,Superb.. coming from a Pilates instructor,"Great pictures. It begins with a beginners program, then it takes you into intermediate as well as advance. It breaks down the exercise step by step (as though you were watching a video). This book explains exactly what the exercise targets and the reps that should be performed. As a Pilates instructor I refer to this book quiet often."
3,Good Mat Reference Book,"This book is a good reference for most of the Pilates mat work. There are visuals of the progressions through the exercises as well as pictures of what can be done incorrectly, which may help those exercising at home."
1,Outrageously expensive,"Like a lot of textbooks, this one forces starving students to buy a mediocre book at best when any would do. There is nothing special about this book. It has the usual back-and-forth dialogue between people and typical suggestions of exercises that have been around forever."
4,Beautiful Ring!,"This is a beautiful ring that is of excellent quality. The only reason I did not give it a complete 5 stars is because I prefer very dark tiger's eye and this stone is very light. However, because the overall quality of the ring is so phenomenal, I am keeping it. It should be noted that the ring sits on the finger at a slant, not upright as in the picture. That is not a problem in appearance, just trying to help with a description. I actually prefer the slanted look for this ring."
1,"Weak, very weak","At some point, no amount of technological posturing can save a novel; Tom Grace overreaches that point. The hero extricates himself from laughably dire situations, not by his own wits, but by the petty stupidity of his adversaries. This does not make for a satisfying read.The pacing is obviously abetted by a good editor, as is the dialog, but, like a remake of ""The Bad News Bears,"" even Scorcese could only do so much with bad raw materials.I tend to alternate between non-fiction reading of some weight and light fiction in the thriller genre. On the light side, I'm generally not too picky. With this prententious drivel, however, I draw the line. Only if you think random, illogical aggregations of high-tech buzzwords are ""cool"" will you find this engaging."
3,HempShake Berry Pomergranate,I sincerely wanted to enjoy this product. Learning the antioxidant benefits of Pomegranate I was excited about finding a nutritious organic healthy shake. Hoping to have this shake as part of my daily nutritious routine I was disappointed when I first tried it. The gritty consistency makes it a little difficult to enjoy this as a drink every morning. I want to try to develop a taste for this nutritious healthy drink so I will continue to include this shake mix as part of my diet routine by consuming one every few days. Maybe an acquired taste is necessary for this product{?}
4,Very good for you & organic,"I have purchased this in the canister and was very happy with it, but wanted to try individual packets this time because I have been busy and didn't want to have to measure. There is not as long of a shelf life on this, so I was a little disappointed and that is why I took a star off. I tend to do a shake or two a week. I'll have to step up the pace.It is great to blend up with frozen cherries and almond milk (Either regular or chocolate).High quality ingredients and helps native people with fair trade prices. A business doesn't get much more caring than this! Thanks Nutiva!!"
3,Nothing special,"I wanted to like this book, but Shannon - the character, not the author - is so self-absorbed, I found it an irritating read. Hmmmm, since the author named her main character after herself, what conclusions can we draw from that?Anyway, being in much the same situation as Shannon (again, the character), I wanted to love this book. But it really stretched my patience! Still, there were some amusing sections that I did enjoy. Without those, this would have only received one star from me."
2,ugh... Disappointed...,"I LOVED Olsen's first book so was excited to read this one - but I nearly hated it! Seemed like just another 30 something women depressed no one would marry her... how trite. Even though many readers didn't like the first one because it was ""weird"" - I loved it because of its quirky/uniqueness... This one just seemed to be more of the same of everything that's already out there...."
4,A Satisfying Sequel to Welcome to My Planet,"I brought this book with me on a recent vacation and finished it within a few days. I was excited to learn more about ""Shanny"" and was enjoying every minute of it until things took an unexpected and somewhat disturbing turn. I found the second half of this book to be almost incompatable with the first half but felt very satisfied in the end. When I finished reading, I turned the book into my hotel's book bin and saw that it was picked up by someone else right away. I hope to hear from Shannon again soon."
5,Spirituality Through the Lens of Generation X,"Shannon is the Kathleen Norris, Anne Lamott and Julia Cameron of her generation! Her writing is inspired for creating a link between Christianity and the young adult of today. The emancipation battle between her and her mother as well as her transformational experience of a Catholic woman struggling to find her authentic, God-given voice while living in the land of Lutherans, is strikingly human. Her seemingly endless and often times futile therapy sessions act as a comforting reminder that life is not easy and at times even resigns to ""just showing up"". Shannon takes us on a bumpy, unflattering journey toward wholeness and leaves us with hope and joy as she circles deeper within herself. This is a must read for all clergy who are truly dedicated to listening for the longing for God in contemporary society."
1,Spend your money on a latte instead,"My book club picked this book based on positive reviews. Of the eight of us, two gave it a ""readable if there was nothing else around"". Two couldn't finish it because they found it so trite and the rest of us (being proper Minnesotans) finished it based on Lutheran guilt which requires us to always finish what we start. The story went on and on with no discernable plot line. To resolve the only interesting plot element, the author use the wimpy literary device of giving a character a terminal illness. If you're from Chaska MN you may find all the references to local landmarks fun, but if not don't waste your money. This book will be on the remainder table very soon if it isn't there already. Even then, read it for free in the book store cafe if you must read it at all - spend your money on a nice latte to keep you awake while you muddle through to the end."
2,Let the kvetching begin!,"My goodness---whine, whine, whine. This book is very wry, and funny, however, I got very tired of all the introspection focusing on the problems of others'. The protagonist certainly doesn't look at HERSELF as causing any of the circumstances she finds herself in. A great book if you want to blame others for your current condition........"
1,stop them all before they write again!,"Shannon Olson is no doubt a funny writer, but please! how many promising careers are being snuffed out by Bridget Jones rip-offs of hapless women in their thirties looking for love by gazing at their navel? Olson's good, but she's got to move on!"
3,It dragged on too long!,"I read Shannon Olson's first book and I liked it, but this book was almost the exact same! It dragged on forever and was way depressing because no one would marry her, and she was in therapy, and she doesnt know what to do all the time........I wanna slap her and say, ""make up your mind!""But it was really sad how Adam died, I really didnt think he was going to."
2,A Manual??,The book is very basic and reflects not too much more than the Workbench software manual. Poor examples and as bad as the original Workbench literature it does not elaborate on ERROR messages neither on the circuit analyses parameters.If you have any experience in electronics circuits you will conclude that this book is a pile of worthless paper!!
2,Book was dated.,"The book was dated and the software was too old to run on my computer. I don't know if the content is dated or not, will use it as a reference."
5,Artful Machine Piecing,"Not traditional piecing by any stretch of the imagination. I think Ruth McDowell is a master designer; have several of her books. I liked this book so much when I took it out of the library that I had to own it. The quilt samples are magnificent and her design ideas are very inspiring, gets you thinking beyond the block with landscapes, flowers, people, Oh My!."
5,"Jairo Raúl Chacón Vargas`s review on the book ""Making Sense of Factor Analysis""","I am a PH student at Universdad Nacional de Colombia (Engineering Faculty). The Pett et al.`s book presents a detail explanation (focuses on ""HOW"") of the procedure involved to make factor analysis (FA). The authors made a great effort in writing a book understandable to those inexperienced researchers with no strong formation in statistics. The only thing that I criticize is that this wonderful book was written emphasizing on the ""how"" with less focus on the ""why"" and very little treatment on the explanation and foundations of the descriptive and statistical approach of FA."
4,Wigwam Socks review,I've been wearing Wigwam 625 socks for years - - I like them a lot. I'm assuming that they've still of the same quality.
3,What I expected,This sock has a nice feel and I like it but it's use is limited to boots or high-top sneakers as it does not stay up. Its a great sock for those types of footwear. For those types of footwear I like it better than my elastic wool socks. Old school comfort.
5,two of a kind,"My husband loves wool socks for hiking with the dog - so he was blown away when he found these under the Christmas tree. Not just one sock, but a matching pair; no more searching for another just like it, now he just slips these on and keeps on trucking. The ultimate in convenience, style and grace, three hallmarks of a TRUE hiking enthusiast."
2,"I Don't Like Them - They Are Itchy, Not White","I bought a pair of these back in September of 2010 and I've only worn them once.I was disappointed with them already when I first pulled them out of the packaging. They aren't white - they are off-white, sort of tan or cream colored. I was hoping for something that would replace my white, cotton GoldToe socks but these are not a good replacement if you prefer white.My other, perhaps bigger complaint is that they are not very soft... they are actually quite itchy. I don't have this problem with any of my other wool socks which I purchased from two different leading suppliers of wool socks.These socks do look well made although I haven't worn and washed them enough to know how well they would last. I'm giving them two stars because I was very disappointed with how itchy they are and with the fact that they are actually off-white, not white as advertised."
1,not warm at all,"i'm returning these because, 1. they itch my skin, feet and ankle. 2. not warm enough. did not meet my needs. but the itching was enough to consider returning them."
3,Great pair of socks - ONE PAIR!,"To be fair, I'm knocking this down hard because it was not clear (to me) that this was $8 for a single pair of socks. They're comfy, but big whoop. You can get a 3 pack of decent socks for $8."
1,Mercer Mayer's Computer Games,"PLEASE let me know whenever these wonderful games are ""up to speed"" with using WindowsXP... I can get them on ebay, why can't AMazon provide them?"
5,What Christmas Is REALLY All About,"During the rush of the Christmas season, oftentimes we forget what Christmas is really all about. In an exceptionally beautiful and reverent way, NATIVITAS reminds us of how God's love came to us in the birth of Jesus Christ. The music takes us on a journey of a spiritual nature with beautiful a cappella voices of the Choir of New College. An exquisite flute transitions medieval, classical and contemporary carols which have been intelligently arranged thus giving the listener a peaceful and reflective musical experience.Especially beautiful are ""The Little Road to Bethlehem"" and the ""Stille Nacht"".NATIVITAS is a celebration of what all christians hold most dear--God's grace and God's love for each one of us. Through listening, it reminds us once again what Christmas is REALLY all about. Highly recommended."
4,"New Age flute, be gone!!","Nativitas is a good recording of 23 Christmas classics, such as ""Adam Lay Ybounden"" and ""O Magnum Mysterium"". I say ""good"" because interspersed among some of the pieces is this cloying New Age flute. It really gets annoying when the flute plays over the choir on the last song, ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"". I bought the CD to hear the excellent choir, not a flute that doesn't know its place.If you aren't annoyed by the flute, then you can mark the CD up to excellent. It is more ethereal than happy, so take that into consideration before buying. (I like ""ethereal"" better myself.) And a poor choice was made in including ""Once in Royal David's City"" without a solo for the first verse. King's College does that one so much better, New College should have tried something else.With those caveats, I recommend the CD."
5,A blessing of peace and serenity!,"Because of the price, I was quite hesitant in purchasing Taize Chant for Peace and Serenity. However, the open hands on the cover compelled me to try it.I was introduced to Taize by two brothers from the community in 2006. Since then, I've purchased other Taize CD's, yet this one is beyond compare. It really is an hour and ten minutes of peace and serenity in the style of Taize.THIS CD IS AWESOME! It deserves an extra gold star."
3,"""I'm Not Really Here""","Tim Allen's ""I'm Not Really Here"" is a funny, but serous look into the tool mans life. This book also deals with the way things are done in this country. An answers questions whichare questioning the if we are really here or not."
5,Excellent Book. Couldn't put it Down,This book was marvelous! The way Tim Allen writes is af he is right there speaking to you. Full of small humorous tidbits and laughs. A must read
4,I enjoyed the beginning.,"The book really pulled me into it right away, but in the middle section I got too confused with the mind's psyche. I never read his first book but with all the reviews i'll try it anyway. I feel that I still need to finish it before a true grade can be given. At least this book made me see that books doesn't always have to be boring"
4,"If you expect just a funny book, you've missed the boat!","It was interesting that negative reviews of ""I'm Not Really Here"" were all based on expectations that Tim Allen has to be endlessly and obviously funny to be worth reading. ""Au contraire!"" What they miss is considerable. I found that, as with his first book, once through only scratches the surface. If you reread the book, the loopy, elliptical style becomes less of a distraction and you find not only genuine humor missed the first time, but--a real bonus--far more intelligence than the ""Tool Man"" image would have you think. Allen may need work on his writing style, but substance and many a chuckle below the surface make a second look definitely worthwhile"
5,Acertained my conviction that things aren't what they seem,"This book is NOT for those looking for a sequel to Tim's popular first one. This one's on the deep side. Tim Allen made a great effort to make his incredible experiences be published and known to the public. With a little bit of humor, obviously.The book convinced me that reality is more that what our 5 senses tell us. It opened me up on the subject of quantum reality. Even famous phycisists are now talking like eastern mystics.""I'm not really here"" doesn't answer life's questions but is a REALLY GOOD WAKE UP CALL. It gives the drive to make you go and look for your own answers."
2,"Terrible Book, waste of time!","I am a HUGE Tim Allen fan, and though this book was mildly funny, it was very weird and not what I expected. I felt like it was too much of a sci-fi type story with not enough comedy."
3,The Toolman Runs Deep!,"If you're wondering what goes through the mind of a comedian when he's home alone for a weekend, this book is for you. If you're looking for mindless drivel and entertaining anectodes, look further. I admit I was lost on some of the more complex physics references, but the body of work as a whole was revealing as to what Tim Allen thinks, dreams, and worries about. I was totally consumed with how this comic genius's mind works and applaud his courage to put it on paper for all to read. He's not the bumbling idiot I imagined....Tim runs pretty darn deep"
1,"Well, you'll at least be surprised.","What a disappointment considering how great his first book was. So he went through a mid-life crisis and became philosophical about physics and other stuff that no one cares about. Don't know why he wrote about it, and I gave up only a few chapters in because it wasn't worth wasting my time. I was looking for something funny, and this ain't it."
2,He really isn't here,"When I read the other reviews, I got the impression that this would be an in depth biography of his transfomation. Instead it is a pseudo-clever book that says nothing of how Tim turned his life around. I am positive there is a great story waiting to be told that would fascinate any reader. Tim, write a real book, your fans are interested in the real Tim Allen."
3,Hmmm....,"Tim Allen is a wonderful comedian and his first book wassuperb! However, if you are expecting more of the samein his second novel, ""I'm Not Really Here"", don't wasteyour time or money (at least wait for it to come out inpaperback). Tim Allen discusses quantum physics and how itdeals with life...or if we even HAVE a life. There are afew parts that made me laugh...though, not very much! Itdid make me cry also. I was disappointed to find out thatthe book is NOT Mr. Allen telling us his real lifeexperiences through comedy. However, I would reccommendthis book for someone, like me, who wants an inside look tothe person behind the actor.Crystal Renee Teel"
1,What Happened?,I loved his first book. It was a riot. This one just didn't have very much. There were a couple funny parts. I guess I should have given this book a 2 but I was spoiled by how hilarious the first one was.
3,Looks good but make sure it has it's parts,This product came with a crack in the marble. It was also missing pieces needed to assemble it. My husband had some tools so that we could assemble it and once it was assembled it looked great - that's the only reason I didn't give it a lower rating.
1,Misrepresented item,"The picture of the product did not correspond with the item I received. The image shows a stainless or brushed chrome paper towel holder with a large roll for use on a countertop.The item I received was painted white, arrived in a torn and dirty plastic wrapper, had brown stains in several places and a dent where the paint was chipped.When I revisited the website, I noticed that the item's description did not fit the product as pictured in any way:White12 inches wide x 5 inches highSpring-armMounts on wall or under cabinetI was very disappointed about the bad condition the item arrived in, as well as in the misrepresentation of the item; Instead of saving time by purchasing on-line, I lost time."
5,Awsome toothbrush,This has to be the best toothbrush I have ever used. Made my teeth feel extra clean.
1,Not what I expected,Cheaply made and mine (I think was put together wrong). The letters are opposite so regardless of how you rotate it one is upside down. Returned item
3,"David Brinkley, a rambling book","I was quite excited to get David Brinkley's book, as I have enjoyed his newscasts for years, particularly the early conventions. As it turns out, this is a ""Chatty-Cathy"" book that rambles on about his life, with his TV persona somewhat as an afterthought. The book is quite readable with his enjoyable laconic style, but at the end, you don't know much more about him, TV, the process of TV news, or the events to which he was an eyewitness....at least not more than you already knew or could surmise.The book was a pleasant interlude, but somewhat a bit of froth"
3,A small book for such a big career.,It is fine. After all David Brinkley was & is a great reporter. It is too light. It seems to be written because it was expected once he retired. I expected a little more substance and frankly a little more effort.
4,Courtenay Tops Himself Again,"Bryce Courtenay is one of the best authors Ive read in sometime. Unfortunately it is often difficult to find most of his books in the States as some are out of print. Nevertheless, I have thoroughly enjoyed everything he's written but April Fools Day tops them all! This touching story makes you laugh and cry. A wonderful personal account of his sons fight for life. I doubt if there are many of us who have the courage and passion for life that Damon had. It is a tragedy that he died but more importantly a blessing that he was able to touch so many in the short time he was alive. An incredible read! It should be required reading for all."
5,Fan Bloody Tastic,"This is one of the best books i have ever read, and i wish it was on my school english list. WHAT CAN I SAY I LOVE IT. I have read it more than once, it funny, sad and and overall good book"
2,"Important topic, but not well-written","As a B. Courtenay fan, I was eager to read his new work. However, it did not live up to his previously high quality of writing. He took his anger and frustration out on the paper, but instead of giving the story energy, it detracted from the story of love he was attempting to tell. Although he attempted to invite the reader into his son's life, due to his need to relieve his pain through writing, he failed to give the reader a view of the emotions inside his son and partner, which are the interpersonal connections that tie a reader to the characters. It felt more like a laundry list of doctors, hospitals,and medicines."
2,Tedious is the word,"I have read other books by Courteney which I have heartily recommended to others. I love his insight into life in Australia and South Africa. I found this book informative, but tedious. If it was half it actual length it would have suited me well. It's a sad story of life at its hardest. There are definitely some positive moments. On the whole, however, I ended up skipping about half the book. Disappointed."
2,Tedious and disappointing,"Half way though this biography I thought surely there cant be another half a book to go - the main messages have already been fully (over) developed, Damon's sad situation is all downhill and more and more of the same. A disappointingly tedious read."
3,WTF forms reference manual,"Don't buy if you're looking for information on anything other than WTF forms. I was hoping to get a one-stop reference book for kicking, punching, breaking, and sparring as well as forms but instead received a reference manual for Kibon, Taeguk, and Palgwe forms. The author should have just left out the other sections of the book because a couple of sentences is not helpful when you are looking to perfect your kicks, punches, or breaking.I would suggest either The State of the Art or Taekwondo The Korean Martial Art for a better breakdown of the forms because both contain diagrams as well as step-by-step instructions for all the forms in this book (except for Kibon). I'm adding this to my growing collection of TKD books, but I would not have bought it if I had known that it basically only covers forms."
4,Official Taekwondo Training Manual,it was a good book for laren taekwondo there are alot of usfel information it was positve pook to wread
2,There are better books,"I was disappointed that this book covered mainly forms, with only a trivial amount of information on techniques. It also contains many mistakes (like specifying left arm instead of right arm for blocks in forms etc). And it was out of date compared to the forms information on the kukkiwon web site.I would recommendTaekwondo: The State of the Artinstead. It has a much broader coverage, and still includes the forms information."
1,Official Taekwondo training manual,This book is a WTF taekwondo book. I had ordered an ITF taekwondo book. I practice ITF and this book I received is useless to me. I sent an email to Amazon asking for an exchange. I have received no response.
3,Ok but not much better than old antenna,"After extensive on-line research, I purchased the 91XG to replace a 20 year-old antenna mounted in the attic. Living in a rural/fringe area I was frustrated with the unstable signal I was getting --- after I had installed a 26db max. gain antenna amplifier (mounted at the antenna) and a rotator. After mounting the 91XG with rotator and amp. I received only marginally better reception than with the 20 year-old antenna. Other info that might be helpful: the antenna is mounted in the attic of a two story house located on a hill with very few trees in the way. The attic has no insulation in the rafters and there are aphalt shingles on the roof. The coax cable length is about 80 ft. After much experimenting I finally hooked up the old antenna AND the 91XG since the 91XG is UHF only. All in all a lot of time spent for only very marginal improvement over a 20 year old antenna."
3,Improvement but not perfect,"After installing the 91XG Antenna, I now receive all the channels I was expecting...ON GOOD RECEPTION DAYS. However, this antenna frequently doesn't bring in channel 7, 11, and sometimes 9. My previous antenna had no problem with those stations but couldn't bring in many others.For an antenna with these specs, I am somewhat disappointed in its performance."
1,Looks good for a piece of junk...,"I replaced a twenty year old antenna with this one and lost channels. One was a close high powered major station. I had to buy an antenna amplifier to get back my lost channels. I have not seen any increase in picture quality with this one and it has a smaller pick-up window then the 20 year old. I constantly have to tweak the rotor to get the channel back in.It's only UHF so I thought it would be stronger and more focused for that frequency, it's not. I miss my Canadian channels too, I know they are VHF and will not switch over until 2011... But, I cut off the UHF from my old antenna, mounted on my backyard cabin and pull in those Canadian channels crystal clear.This antenna may look high-tech but, you could get better reception with rabbit-ears."
4,free tv is good,Good antenna. Easy to put together. Works great. The only problem it has that wherethe center point of gravity should be can't be installed on the mast. It has a passive element. It has to be balanced by the mounting hardware.
5,"the directions kind of suck, but once you figure out what way is the front the rest is easy.","The directions have a lot to be desired, hard to see photo copy picture on one piece of paper. But once you get figured out what is front and what is the back, it is easy to put together and the picture you get with it is AMAZING!!! Strongly suggest a rotator with it, it have a few small window of reception but the picture you get from it is great and the the distance it was picking up was unbelievable. We were getting stations crystal clear that are well over 70 miles away."
4,Antenna Direct 91XG,"We are in a small valley whereby reception can be difficult. This antenna improved our reception by about 20-30% over an older more ""general"" designed antenna. Now, there is much less drop out, if any, on stations from 25-40 miles distance. The down side is that there are still stations transmitting on the ""VHF RF frequencies"" that this antenna will not receive, i.e., any RF channel less than 14. (Note that Virtual Channel listings may not be an indicator of the actual RF frequency, i.e., one channel we get, virtual 22.1, is actually transmitting on RF 11. We had to customize an antenna for RF channel 11, and include it on the mast. It seems that most of the NBC channels in our area are transmitting on the lower RF channels. However, any hills obstructing the ""direct view"" will prohibit even this antenna from receiving transmissions. Note that this antenna is reasonably directive."
4,Antennas Direct 91XG Uni-directional HDTV Antenna,I installed this antenna at my 2nd house which is located in a valley and I get decent reception. The only complaint I have is that the instructions are non-existent;You need to look at the box to see how it's put together. The antenna is well made and performs as advertised. Overall it's a good deal.
4,Pulls in the stations,"This rather large and unwieldly UHF antenna does work well. I'm in a fringe area of NYC. Coupled with a high gain UHF preamp I was pulling in most of the stations I was interested in. I even was receiving ABC which is a VHF frequency. However this was in winter without the leaves on the trees. I suspect that, I hope not, after spring when the leaves fill out on the trees, I may lose many of the stations. This antenna appears to have less wind loading than the large bowties, but may not hold up to birds sitting on the elements. The published gain values are among the highest available for this class antenna (Fringe) However, this also means it is very directional. It needs to be accurately aimed toward the station or stations you need to receive. This is the final option, if you can't get the stations with this, you won't get them with anything."
1,No Better,"I am 20 to 25 miles from all Memphis transmitters & thought from the reviews that this would be the antenna for me.All transmitters except one is within 20 to 22 degrees & it is at 15 degreesI was very disappointed though. It does not pick up any better than my 25 year old antenna. I did not expect it to pick up the VHF, but it does not pick up all the UHF/HD channels that my old antenna does.Would prefer to have my $76.00 back, but too difficult to take apart & pack for shipping"
5,excellent value,"i live in Toronto, ON, and was having difficulty pulling in the American stations from Buffalo,NY. across Lake Ontario..i installed the 91xg and after some tweaking in terms of direction, the stations now come in totally clear, from 85 miles away..i would recommend this antenna highly...i'm not even using a pre-amp and have a converter for my analog TV.picture is even sharper than it was on cable..thx. for the super product."
3,No better than the average,"I bought this 91XG Antenna because of all the reviews I read on how good it picked up stations. When I installed it, I had a difficult time pointing it so that it could pick up all of my stations efficiently. After I got it pointed correctly, it did fairly well. It is now 30 days later, and it is blacking out on 2 of my favorite stations saying that the signal is weak. I must say that I am somewhat disappointed in what I got for my money."
5,great antenna!,My situation requires picking up a series of stations over 70 miles away with an attic mount. this antenna did so with flying colors. The preamp pa18 was also great in picking up weak signal stations. Planning on buying another antenna to point in the opposite direction to pick up stations over 50 miles away.
4,91xG hdtv antenna,"Shipping was pretty good, everything packed well; when I went to put it together everything was fine till I mounted the elements on the boom, the elements where loose they moved around in the wind, so I had to put little plastic wedges in the element clips so they where snug on the boom. The element problem made it a little disappointing.I get all the Los Angeles HDTV channels with a pre-amp I have a hill between me and Mount Wilson I live in Sylmar SFV"
5,The Best Deep Fringe Antenna,For you guys worried about this antenna not being able to withstand the elements. I can tell you that mine has been up for three years in the NE and we get plenty of bad weather here and it has held up fantastically. I get signals from three states with this antenna from 60 miles away no problem.
2,carriage light,"This item shipped fast and is as, pictured, but unfortuenatly it isd not as bright as I thought a solar light would be. all in all a great light tho."
1,disappointed,don't know why this solar light is no bright at night. n I found the size of this light is too small when compare with the other wall light.
1,Definitely Overpriced,The box was delivered with pieces all over the place. Several pices were even missing. The quality of this product is poor.
5,Awesome,I love this album. A great work of art from a great band. A recommended must have for music fans.
1,Horrid,Scratched disk was loose in holder wasnt new no wraping on it wouldnt replace it said they didnt have anymore
5,Great!,I am 49 years old. Have used proactive products and also visited a dermatologist whom gave me retin - a. My skin has been very oily most of my life. This stuff is the greatest! I can't explain how well it works. It just works! Very soothing but at the same time tingling. Wow! Will buy for the rest of my life.
2,It dries out my skin,"This cleanser might be OK for an oily skin type but doesn't work well on mine. I have skin that's prone to dryness and this cleanser REALLY dries it out, after using it the dryness plagues my skin for days."
5,A first order recommendation!,"Around the interpretation of Schubert 's piano music for four hands there just have been five memorable teams; Walter and Beatriz Klein, Alfred Brendel and Evelyn Crochet,Paul Badura- Skoda and Georges Demus, Schiff and Yuulo Shiokawa and and this notable team Lupu- BarenboimFar from being good news, this fact has determined a comprehensible lack of knowledge about the existence of such musical treasures I the great audiences; on one hand due the extraordinary level of these works well would deserve a major diffusion and on the other hand, a visible process of overlooking around these scores that have not a logic explanation.Fortunately both artists possess the genius touch and it was nothing easy for them to play with such conviction power and expressiveness.A recommended CD for all those who love Schubert' s craft."
1,bad,"terrible, no flavor. I ordered these as a replacement for the cinnamon sugar pita chips. what a mistake. will not purchase again"
1,Disappointed,"While this book gives a good deal of information on the reginal animal and plant life, it is lacking the human history. How did this country come to be?"
5,Ready for some Southern Exposure?,"This is a beautiful work of art. I heard one of her tracks on the radio, and had to get this CD. Isbin proves that truly great music does not need lyrics to speak to you. There are so many subtle nuances to the composition- an unexpected note here, a syncopated rhythm there. ""Julia Florida"" is achingly beautiful. The South American flow keeps my fingers tapping. There is a Latin jazz influence that permeates throughout, perfectly belnding with her classical, intricate guitar style. If you're interested in classical guitar and enjoy a lot of jazz and rhythms, you should search out this CD."
5,Good read!!,"Thoroughly enjoyable from the first page to the last. You will find yourself living the author's life along with him. Like listening to an expert storyteller who holds you enthralled through one adventure to another. Only wish I could have been a fly on the wall at the Chess Game and oh to have met the ""World Champion Wrestler (rassler)"" Then on a more serious note how the application of methods available before DNA were used to solve crimes. Fingerprints, polygraphs (with particular reference to Dave Backster who hooked a polygraph up to one of his plants with startling results. You won't want to put this one down."
5,"A book, which can change your attitude","This book can be very useful for designers. It reminds you of importance of functionality and comfort; shows a difference between art and design.Not to mention the quality, Penguin books are great!"
2,Made for a very narrow foot,"Vaneli Women's Mezida SandalThis shoe was a disappointment due to the fact that it was so narrow, and I normally wear a medium width."
2,What happened!,"Are you sure this is the same woman that wrote ""Out of the Blue""? This was a good story, but was it necessary to have a character with such a filthy mouth? Am I to believe that people from this part of New York talk and act like this? Were I from that part of New York, I'd be offended. For someone who was a concert pianist, Bess certainly didn't speak or act like one. David seemed to be a bit more cultured. I don't mean to be a prude, but I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first one. I just cannot bring myself to give this book more than two stars. This story could have been told in a much better way. This was more like a trashy romance novel and I don't read those. This is the second book of Ms. Mandel's I've read and I won't be so quick to read the next one."
4,"Realistic, unforgettable, heart-warming","Courtesy of A Romance ReviewHeart and Soul is not a regular romance. The story is written in first person, like a diary or biography told by Bess herself. Bess is from a blue-collar family, a straightforward person and never hesitate to express her feelings and thoughts in a colorful way. David Montagnier is the opposite of Bess in both background and personality but he loves the funny side of Bess as well as her talent in music. Ms Mandel has written a realistic, unforgettable, heart-warming story that will surely grace your keeper shelf."
3,Gets you practiced.,Gets your Spanish juices flowing. The only thing I didn't like is that they're a few sections here and there that require Internet access for you to listen to audio to complete.
2,refund,First let me say that I did get a full refund for this product in decent time. The book arrived unbelievably fast but it was missing half of the pages. I contacted the seller and was told to retun it. The purchase price was credited to my card and all is well. I had to buy this book at the campus book store for a much higher price because I had no more time to order one online.
4,Just what I needed for the job.,For years I was using the Torx fittings with my driver kit for every job that needed them. Then I had to get in to my pressure washer to fix a water leak. The Torx screws were deeply recessed in the unit and the driver was too wide to reach the screws. I knew Amazon would have a driver long and skinny enough to fit. I've used the new driver for several other jobs since as the T-15 is evidently a common size screw when Torx screws are needed.
1,Just a bunch of shows thrown on a disc!,"A 24 hour race... 145 mins to show it. So I figure we are going to fly into some race action to cram in everything, right? Wrong?30 MINS devoted to testing30 MINS devoted to qualifying (a fairly meaningless excercise for a 24 hour race)15 MINS to the pre-race historic raceAnd then FINALLY we get to the raceAnd here is the worst part. This is blatantly a bunch of Le Mans shows (three of them, the testing show, qualifying show and then overall weekend/race show). So what do they show during the weekend/race segment... a COMPLETE re-run for about 20 mins of what they just showed during the qualifying segment! I'm serious, I thought I must have hit back a chapter on my remote control since I was looking at what I just watched.A complete waste of time and money this disc. Next year I'm just going to tape some of the footage - it's what's on the disc anyway (since there are also no extras) and save my self a few bucks."
1,Only works with 95 and 98,"This steaming turd doesn't work with anything above windows 98, a 5 year old operating system. I just wasted an evening finding this out. Why are they still selling this ?"
3,For the Beginners,"This title has me a little worried with the maker.The art itself is beautifuly well-donebut the characters come off extremely young looking.One 18-year old character looks as though hecould be a 12-year old walking around with a fake ID.Almost Crying is definetly for Yaoi-beginners.If your just getting into the yaoi scene anddon't think you are ready for hardcore boyboy sexgo ahead and pick this title up.If your a seasoned veteran of Yaoi you might bedisappointed as I was, Nothing very ecchi but alltoo TOO sweet.I've only read it twice since I bought it (two weeks ago)but I can not get past how young the characters lookso if that's your thing go ahead and buy this."
2,Micari Shelly - yaoirealm.com,"If you like very silly, sappy, mushy Yaoi romance with no purpose or meaning (or erotica), you might like this manga.Personally, I thought it was a waste of money.The book includes several different stories, with different characters. But each story has at least one character who is overly-emotional.If you want a more sophisticated Yaoi romance manga, with the same feel to it, try reading ""Same Cell Organism""."
3,"One word - ""sweet""","A collection of sweet shounen-ai stories (some of them pretty good) if you like a dose of sticky sweetness once in a while. The boys are so cute that they look babyish. This is fine as there is nothing beyond hugging and chaste kissing though the last few pages are up to your imagination. For those of us who want more of this kind of sweet and cute shounen-ai, try ""Beyond My Touch"" which I prefer."
3,"Not quite my thing, but some may enjoy it!","As the other reviewer mentioned, this book may appeal to people new to yaoi. There are some unique stories, with unusual characters (with unusual fetishes - such as the character with a thing for dolls). This is definitely a cute book, with cute characters with cute problems.However, all of the characters looked between the ages of 7 and 12 to me - even those who were supposed to be over 18 or were the owners of amusement parks. Also, I found the bodies to be oddly proportioned.This was a book with many small mini-stories as opposed to one main storyline, but unfortunately, I was not able to really be drawn into any of the stories. I know it can be done, as `But you're my teacher!' by Row Takakura had a similar `many small stories' format but there I was easily drawn into each story.For a reader way out of her teens, such as myself, this was not the manga for me - but this manga may appeal to younger readers. :)"
2,Ho Hum.,"One would think Western publishers would pick the cream of the crop to put out in English, but it seems they have decided to give an accurate sampling of Japanese manga mediocrity instead. It's difficult to thumb through the slew of BL popping up all over the place for the good stuff, but I bet my luck on this because it looked cute. Well, cute is pretty much all there is to it. There's almost no character development or progression. In fact, they're all flat as a pancakes. There's also almost no reasonable story progression to make the characters get together. They just do. But if that's what you're looking for, hey, it's right here."
3,good for length,"This was great for the amount of time spent. It left out alot of our favorites such as The Virginian. There was only an acknowledgement of Rawhide, touching on Wagon Train. To do justice to the classic TV westerns it needed to be longer and more in depth. It left us wanting more and feeling like we overpaid for what we got."
4,Awesome,"My favorite song on this awesome album is Piece of Man, which is the opening song. She explains how having a part-time man is better than no man at all. I love the bluezie sounds that Koko blares out. Very emotionally gripping."
5,Koko Taylor - Old School,"Koko Taylor still has got it! This is a great blues cd, some great musicianship and Koko sounds great1"
4,BLACK RAT,"released in 2007, her first album in seven years, Koko Taylor picks up right where she left off, without skipping a beat, as the undisputed Queen of the Blues. This woman still has great chops at 72 years old, her raw, gut-bucket style of singing can still peel the paint right off the walls, nothing subtle or introverted about her singing. Great backup playing by her band, too. LET THE JUKEJOINT JUMP!"
1,Country name spelled wrong!,"C'mon guys, the country is Afghanistan, not AfghanEstan! As far as putting these decals on, they are simple and quick. I bought others and put them on my Land Rover. I guess I'll keep this one as a spelling test for passers-by. The others get a good rating.UPDATE: I contacted the company that makes these decals and within 10 days they reprinted them with the correct spelling. Good job guys."
1,Not the right product,"I ordered this product with the description fitting the lights i needed. However, they are the wrong ones and i do not know how to return them they do not fit the light strings i have although the product seems to be correct. Can someone help me."
2,Not My Favorite,"The stories in this anthology did not grab or keep my attention for very long. They were disjointed and lacked excitement. On some, it felt like we were joining the story half way through and not having read some of the authors prior, I had little idea of the background between characters."
3,Meh... Not sure about this one,"These stories did NOT belong in the same collection. The last one was a good read, but without any of the steamy-ness I expected from stories combined with a Kate Douglas work. Unlike one of the other reviewers (who obviously hasn't read any of Ms. Douglas' other works) I expected more graphic erotica than the last one delivered. Ok, so maybe it was just that the book ended on the least of the four and that has set me off. However, I may have never finished the book if it had started with that one. Good stories, short on hot."
2,Nocturnal,"These are short stories by 4 authors, 3 of whom I never read before. I liked 3 out of 4, One had too much graphicerotica for my taste. I wouldn't pass it on to a friend."
5,Great Book!,This was a great. It almost brought me to tears and if you like this book yo should read A Christmas Melody and you will see that they go hand in hand!
3,The ultimate book for microwave cooking??,"It does not fit my needs 100% so I give it 3 stars. It has alot of usefull information when it comes to using a microwave for cooking like placement and conversions. The thing that I don't like is the choices in recipies. There are many of them, but for my taste it really didn't do much for me.I do recomend this book for the information, but unless you have a taste for ALL food types including some interesting combinations, I would not recomend it.It's a toss up. Information v. recipies. Still, it is an excellent buy and a great source of information."
2,Old info,"I looked all over for a good microwave cookbook but don't think I found it. The recipes are complex in a lot of cases but most importantly are based on old microwave technology of around 700 watt ovens. Most full-size ovens today are at least 1000 watts. Moreover, the disclaimer states that there is no tried and true formula for converting to a larger wattage.DISAPPOINTING---but can't find a CURRENT book either !!!"
5,A New Classic,"This cookbook joins other cookery bibles like Fanny Farmer and Joy of Cooking on my bookshelf -- all dogeared and written in and soup spattered. Have used it for years, and it's superb -- so superb that I had to buy another copy when the old spine gave out and the book fell apart!"
5,Best deal around. Order it now!,"I don't think you'll find a better deal on this type of toolkit anywhere. You get a decent selection of tools and they are not bad quality. CDW actually has this exact item for $58.99, so don't bother looking around anymore and order it from Amazon today!"
1,missing pieces.,"You mark the product as like new, yet 6 items are missing? Customer service obviously isn't your forte I see."
1,cheap pile of scrap,This is a cheap pile of scrap that look as if they were handmade in china.. not worth more than 10 dollars.
4,Decent tool kit,"This took kit is not bad. It has a lot of things that I did not have, all in a handy case that is attractive and will be able to easily accommodate replacement tools as the originals wear out. I have to agree with many people about the flashlight. It is a piece of junk. It does not even have an on-off switch. You have to unscrew the light bulb holder part to turn it on and off, and if you don't unscrew it enough, I guarantee that your batteries will run down very fast. If you are a professional, you will probably feel like this is junk, but if you are just wanting to fix your own laptop, this will give you the tools that you need."
2,Belkin 55-Piece Computer Tool Kit,I was disappointed in the quality of the individual tools. I expected more from Belkin as I have purchased items from Belkin before. I would not recommend this product to my friends.
4,This is a nice set of basic computer tools.,"It's a good set at a good price made by a good company. Can I say more? Yes. The wire strippers don't look like much, but they work great."
1,Buy it from Amazon,This is the same item that Amazon itself sells for $29.95. The picture of the item has simply been turned upside down to make it look different.
4,Excellent for SMALL home/business applications,"This kit is excellent if all you gotta do is work on some computers, radios, almost anything electronic around the house. Many of the tools inside are helpful for other tasks: the ratchet screwdriver appears to be great; the knife inside is awesome AND sharp; and the soldering gun (NO SOLDER INCLUDED!!!!) is amazing and it's why I bought the kit. Overall, I give this 4.5/5 stars."
5,Awesome set for the computer men out there,"I was looking for something my boyfriend could use in order to fiddle around with all the small gadgets of computers and this was perfect it came with everything he would need to fix,take apart,pull etc etc. I also liked the fact that it said it was non magnetic which would be all bad if it was not.The pieces look high quality and the description is true to form and the price was fantastic it comes in a case that is well made and everything has its departments to keep things in place and sturdy."
3,Items are of moderate quality and usefulness,"The tools included make a decent basic computer toolkit. The tools are unlikely to break with heavy use, but they will certainly rust eventually. I've been using these kits in various forms for years and all the pliers and bit drivers have ended up rusty.The soldering iron is cheap. The flashlight is crap.I would gladly pay another $25 for the kit if it contained a powerful LED flashlight with a smaller footprint and a basic power driver instead of the manual ratchet driver."
2,Buyer Beware!!!,"The variety of tools is nice but needs a Static Wrist Strap to be included. Plan on purchasing one separate if buying this kit. The soldering iron went out on second use, very low quality iron. The pen knife blade continually falls out unable to tighten to keep blade in. Flash light is made of the cheap plastic, dropped and broke. I would return this product for a refund but threw light in trash before iron went out. Buyer Beware!"
2,"No torx, small head screws are tough to use","I bough this to upgrade my laptop's hard drive, and there was no torx drivers in the kit. A computer kit with this many pieces should really have torx. The small headed screws that are locked into a metal pen-like device would not lock in correctly. This could be user error, but I had trouble maneuvering them and getting the smallest screw heads to lock into the holder. I haven't used much else within this kit yet."
2,Underwhelming,This toolkit devotes most of its space to stuff you'll rarely if ever use. Most of the tools are unnecessarily awkward to take out and put back in. The picture is also not an accurate representation of what's included.
3,needs more info,"i found this book to be lacking alot of info and not staying on any subject for too long, but i have to admit that yes i did learn a few things that i didnt know before"
3,Arcade fun but not much more,"This game is far from the puzzle-solving,logic-based Putt Putt games. It's well done and fun, but don't expect much learning to occur."
4,Nice Swim Goggles,"These are a good value for the price. They look better on than most. I am still working with the straps to get the best fit but so far I am far more satisfied than with the more expensive, tinted lens Tyr goggles that I bought."
4,"""racoon eyes"" no more","I've tried 4-5 different goggles. These are the only ones that don't leave me with goofy rings around my eyes for several hours afterward. I don't think the rings became a problem until after I turned 40.The gaskets are noticeably softer than others I've tried, but they still seal well. To avoid rings around the eyes, I adjust the strap as loose as it will go.Only drawback is that the nose bridge crunches down on my nose pretty hard, but most of the others do as well."
5,Perfect,"I got these to swim laps at the local YMCA and they are working great. I swim for about 20 minutes and then take a break, and I never had to adjust the goggles at all, even with doing flip turns. I didn't jump off the block or anything, but I still think they wouldn't slip. They didn't leak or fog up a bit. Great goggles!!"
5,wow!,"Wow, these are great. Never had a pair of goggles that didn't leak or give me a headache. They are very comfortable and seal tight."
4,Very comfortable goggle with some minor leaking,This is a very comfortable goggle that I have used for casual swimming. I want to give it 5 stars but there it does leak a bit. It is definitely one of the more comfortable goggles I have owned and would recommend based on this alone.
4,Hydrospex Swim Goggles,I really like these goggles. They work well to keep water out of my eyes and the tinted colors helps with seeing underwater. I highly recommend them.
3,Small head goggles,"I swim weekly. I like speedo goggles. These are satisfactory in terms of minimal leaking and average amounts of fogging. But if your head is bigger than average, like mine, these goggles will probably be too small. They start to hurt after 30 minutes of swimming."
4,Speedo Hydropex Goggles - adult size,"Having tried a number of generic and even other Speedo swim goggles, I'm happy I found this model as it fits my facial structure better than the others. Still tends to fog up and I'll try some of the ""home-remedies"" when I swim again soon. You know, rub a raw potato inside the goggles; smear and thin layer of non-gel toothpaste in the goggles; spit in the goggles, etc."
3,"nice, but...","The seal around the eyes works great and the quality is good, however the solid bridge on the goggle tends to rub on the bridge of my nose. Perhaps this will lessen if I get the tension on the straps figured out."
4,"Great performance, industrial look","These are good fitting, durable goggles. All Speedo goggles seems over priced. Ladies may not like the large ""weldors glasses"" look."
5,perfect,i got this for my mom and shes been using it since forever. it's good quality and water doesnt go in. the band is still tight. i would recommend this product
5,Good value and comfortable,"I finally decided to get a new pair of goggles after using my old pair for over ten years and the lenses were getting hazy. These are extremely comfortable and optically very clear. I wear them for over an hour a time doing laps and never need to take them off for any discomfort. The anti-fog coating works very well, but I don't know yet how long it will last. I rinse them in fresh water after swimming to get the chlorine off in hopes of extending the anti-fog...who knows. They are great in the pool and I use them for open water lake swims for triathlons as well. May not be the ""fastest"" goggles out there by any stretch, but they are comfortable for as long as I can keep swimming (and haven't had one drop of water leak in yet)."
5,Excellent goggles for lap swimming,"As a lap swimmer, I have tried several different types of goggles, and I found the Speedo Hydrospex to be best, at least for me. Once you adjust the straps, which is very easy, they stay put and never leak. I suggest that you get a pair with tinted lenses if you swim outdoors or the lights for your indoor pool are bright."
2,What happened to these?,"I used to be a fan of these goggles and used them for several years with a level of satisfaction that would have earned them at least a four-star rating. However, after purchasing a new pair recently, I've had nothing but problems. No matter how I adjust the fit, I get incredible leaks after only 25m. It's a shame because I really do like the clarity of the lenses and how bright and crisp everything appears through them. Obviously, though, when you're not able to get an effective workout for having to empty your goggles every 100m (if you're lucky), nice lenses are hardly worth having. I won't be spending my money on another pair of these again."
4,Former swim coach,"I do not personally use this type of goggles, but when I coached age group competitive swimmers these were the first ones that I recommended. They are easy to fit, they don't leak if properly fitted to the face, and the nose is fairly comfortable for kids about 9 and up. I recommend the junior for those with a small face or small bridge to the nose."
5,good goggles,"I have purchased these goggles in the past, and have always liked their looks and performance. I would recommend them to anyone."
3,"Ok, but Speedo does make nicer ones","These goggles aren't bad, but there are several other Speedo models that I have owned before and since that I think are better for the same price. I do not find these as easy to loosen as other models and they fog up easily. They are comfortable, but again, based on the price I would go with another model of Speedo goggles."
1,Poor quality would give Zero if I could.,Really light weight and flimsy. What you would expect from $2.00 goggles not $12.00. I have used Speedo goggle for over 40 years and these are the worst value for money goggles i have owned. Maybe I should stick to trying before I buy.PS my last pair of Speedo goggles lasted 8 years and costed the same price all considered.2 months is all i give these goggles. If these are really Speedos goggles.......... then Speedo needs to Wake UP.
3,A influence can not understand the work,"Obviously, the author does not understand the work (even though he claims himself to be in it). Still a good biography when taken as looking through the lenses of the lower unable to understand the higher."
5,Don't be fooled by somewhat odd Cd cover! superb CD!!!,"This cd has 4 tracks, all a different suit of orchestral music. Although Evita is the cover, it doesn't really stand out from the pack. i was actually impressed with the Cats suite and most of all by the Phantom suite. The orchestra just seems so full, and filled with life, that you really get a feeling that lots of love and care went into these recordings. It's just so great to spend just 15 min in a day, and be taken on a musical journey through your favorite musicals with such a superb orchestra.for any Andrey Loyd Weber fan, this is a must!"
5,A superb manual for intermediate to advanced chess players,"Play The King's Indian: A Complete Repertoire For Black In This Most Dynamic Of Openings by Joe Gallagher (English Grandmaster and winner of the 2001 British Championship) is the latest in a long list of first-rate Everyman Chess titles devoted to meticulous instruction, strategy, and tactics concerning specific chess techniques. Written by a King's Indian expert, Play The King's Indian carefully dissects the advantages, disadvantages, and theory concerning this popular opening move for Black and how White can defend against it. Diagrams and a wealth of sample games pepper this guide as vivid illustrations to its key points. A superb manual for intermediate to advanced chess players, sure to offer insight and improvements to one's gameplay."
4,"Well set out, effective variations, excellent explanations.","Gallagher has written a really good book. The lines he offers are quite good and he explains a lot of what is going on, the book is not all about lists of moves."
5,dependable gallagher,i just dont get it: why is this book made by everyman instead of gambit?not much to say except this book is excellent written by someone with tons of experience and knowledge about the opening.I would highly reccomend this book for its theoretical content and explanations.
2,Drive quits writing DVD's after a year,"This drive worked like a champ for about a year, then slowly started producing bad DVD burns. The DVD's would read on the drive but would give sector errors on other drives. It quickly got worse over time to the point any DVD it burns will not read. It got light to medium use, probably an average of 1-2 DVD's a week."
1,The reasons not to buy,"I bought this product about a year ago and it only worked for two months. I made probably 10 DVD's with it. Now the tray won't open and my computer won't recognize it. Then you only get a year warrenty with the product but if it messes up anytime after that you are screwed because there is no option to buy a new warrenty. They tell you to buy a new burner to get a new warrenty.I bought it off of Apple's website and not too many people disliked the product, there was only one review, but now you can read tons of bad reviews for the product. Look elsewhere for a burner."
3,One star per ``Dog'' for this unvarnished truth.,"Readers of exiled Dog, Chuck Negron's intense new tell-all, ``Three Dog Nightmare,'' looking for a video fix to put it all together visually will likely (as I did) find this their only ready alternative. That said, while the audio quality of this 1975 PBS TV concert leaves something to be desired, it nonetheless gives fans an entertaining deja view of a group that went from Top 40 frequent flyers to Oldies has-beens, as quickly as you can say ``disco.'' Or, for that matter, ``drugs''. Worth checking out. But here's hoping for a more digitally precise encore, preferably on DVD. And none of that ``Two Dog'' or ``One Dog Night stuff, either."
3,"Positive, but could be better","Fans of this talented yet troubled threesome will be satisfied if not thrilled by this video. Chuck Negron emerges as the star of this production with his vocal range and obvious talent. Danny Hutton appears out of it (probaby why he was dropped later that year). Cory Wells gives a half-hearted effort, and the band really misses original drummer and bassist. overall, a decent effort by a talented band nearing the end of a great career."
4,3 DOGS IN HEAT !!!!!!,"HOT DOG, THESE DUDES ARE HOT STUFF. SOME REAL GREAT TUNES ON HERE INCLUDING-CELEBRATE, ELIS COMING, SHAMBALA, THE SHOW MUST GO ON, PIECES OF APRIL, ALL DONE LIVE FROM CHICAGO IN THE MID-SEVENTIES. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL YOU 3 DOG FANS !!!!!P.S. ITS REALLY A DOGGONE SHAME THAT SINGER CHUCK NEGRON IS NO LONGER PERFORMING WITH THE BAND. THIS IS THE ONLY VIDEO THAT HAS THE ORIGINAL 3 BOW-WOWS. I AM GLAD I PURCHASED IT."
5,Three Dog Night Soundstage (VHS),I was very glad to know that I could perchase a tape of one of my favorite bands of the 70's. What a treat to see them at the beginning of their career when they weretogether as a group. I would recommend this to those Three Dog Night fans out there.
1,Three Dog Night Soundstage,I've been waiting since June for this item. I can't rate it because i haven't received it.
3,OK,"I remember getting christmas blend around 4, 5 and 6 years ago and it had a kind of mild eggnog/nutmeg/spiced flavor that I can't describe very well but I liked. This year-2007- I don't taste that flavor at all-disappointing -maybe my taste buds getting too old."
1,CD is Misleading!,"I normally don't buy CDs with a odd cover, but this CD listed a lot of songs I liked with the names of the original artists. However, I have no idea if these are the original artists since none of the songs sound like the originals. I was so mad! I guess I should have looked for the label ""original songs sung by original artists."" In my opinion, this CD was a waste of money, and in this economy, I don't have money to be wasting. Thumbs down on this CD!"
5,Great Paper for Art printing,"This paper is great for printing digital art work on, which is the use I had for it. Great color acceptance and saturation. Overall good product."
5,great paper for prints,"This paper is an excellent, heavyweight paper for posters or prints. It works well on my Epson 1400 printer. The paper arrived quickly from Amazon, without any damage to the box or paper."
5,Great paper,I use this paper to print my fine art paintings. It's beautiful. Iuse an epson printer with pigment inks. Love this paper.
1,Item Damaged!!,"I ordered 2 reams but both of them had been badly damaged; the boxes protecting the paper were torn and bent, as if someone had dropped both of them on one corner, and to my dismay, ALL of the sheets had been damaged as a result! The corners of the paper had terrible creases that were obvious and unfixable. I was using these to print high quality prints for sale, and these are now unusable. These are very expensive papers to simply let this go.I am guessing these were dropped in the Amazon Warehouse, as the larger Amazon box the reams had been shipped in wasn't damaged at all!"
1,WRONG PAPER!! DON'T TRUST THIS SELLER,"BUYER BEWARE! This seller scammed me! I ordered 4 boxes of 13x19"" Epson Ultra Premium Presentation Paper (5 star grade) as it shows in the picture but when I got them, the boxes said 11x17"" Premium Presentation Paper (3 star grade)!!!The 3 star grade is flimsy like normal generic paper, not stiffer cardstock like the Ultra Premium. Terrible, will never do business with again!"
3,Not quite..,"I bought this because I thought it contained a version of this song that I wanted but it didn't. Oh well, these versions are pretty good."
3,sunset...,"well sunset (bird of prey) started off engaing with the Jim-Morrison sample Bird of Prey, but something is lacking here cos the sample is looped around the same beat without any significant developments...Fatboy Slim seem not sure where it is headed for...a great song tto start off a change in direction...but the album does contain some potent songs especially the 2 luded collaborations with Macy Gray and the wonderful Something Bourt My Baby & A song for shelter"
5,thoroughly enjoyed!,"I read this book and immediately wanted to go stay at Mel's hotel, the Ingleside Inn. (I haven't yet, but will someday!) He has some of the best stories that give the reader a good inside view of Palm Springs."
4,A great way to learn about different flavors,"This is a great way of learning about different cheeses, and what there flavors are.Gorgonzola is a stronger cheese, usually used for salads - very tangy with a stronger after taste, something I think everyone can really enjoy in that matter. A classic is romaine lettuce, gorgonzola and apple slices.In contrast, gouda is a milder creamy cheese, great for breads. If cheddar were a starting point, I would say gouda is more creamy. It tends to break and crumble less easily, and really stick to bread surfaces better.Both will make you forget about the normal supermarket colby or cheddar. I recommend this sampler highly."
5,igourmet cheesy review,"Igourmet's Favorites is just as good as being in another country in person. Sampling the generous sized cheese's with a San Francisco sourdough and a glass of fabulous California wine, and never having to leave the comfort of my own home is the best. Go ahead and treat yourself to a pleasant worldly experience."
4,"An interesting historical perspective for a child of Berks County, PA","For a fifth generation American, Berksiana provided historical perspective I'd been seeking on my ancestors. If your focus is Berks County and you need an introduction, it's the right resource"
3,Not bad... not the best.... but not a total loss,"for what they were worth, GIRL, the glam-rock band from the UK circa the early 80s, had all the makings of the typical trash-post-punk-glam-slam rock bands of the time. The hi-lite here is Phil Collen on guitar, with blistering leads that set him apart from the rest of the band. Obviously enough was his playing setting him apart from the band that Del Leppard offered him a spot a few weeks after this was recorded (and a rather poor recording for a Label release). In the liner notes, it seems Iron Maiden attempted (unsuccessfully) to recruit Collen into their fold earlier in this same tour. I like this for its simple rock n roll formula, and any glam rock fan from Hanoi Rocks to the Darkness would dig on this CD. Have fun!"
2,Nice try but no banana,"A great chance sadly missed. The wrong tour and a sub-bootleg quality recording does very little to ensure that people remember this raw, attitude-driven band for what they were at the time. There must be better material available? Even I have a better recording of a gig they did, where both the audience and the band sound like they were actually having quite a good time. I can only imagine that the mighty dollar beckoned. Shame."
3,Poor sound and check the gig list...,"Sadly, I don't own a better sounding live recording from Girl, as apparently do some of my peer reviewers. Girl's ""available"" CD's are a-way-ay-ay too expensive, and that is a shame. Girl came to me as a sheer breath of freshness in the midst of NWOBHM, a couple of light years ago by the time of their first release in continental Europe. Although I enjoyed discovering through this CD new (as in new to me, please pardon my ignorance) songs, I would have hoped for those numbers to have been presented in a more hi-fi manner. And possibly more numbers from beloved Sheer Greed. Best, ..."
5,This is a great choice,"I didn't have time to conduct any special surveys or waste time at computer stores. Luckily, I bumped into this cool digital from FujiFilm and got excited. This piece is great, very small yet powerful and of great quality. Images are sharp, even on low-mode, the 60 sec video option is great and the web-cam ability is even cooler.Installation on WinXP is a snap, menus and configurations are pretty straight forward. I personally didn't look at the manual AT ALL.This is a great camera for your money! Be sure to include re-charging batteries and another memory card at your purchase. Both gets empty pretty fast.And no, I don't work for Fuji :)"
4,Fujifilm FinePix 2800: Still the best after 12 years,"Having owned this camera for 12 years I'm still trying to find a decent replacement that takes such good pictures: superb colour and crisp images are the strong points of this fine Fuji product. While my Panasonic Lumix 16 MP is a good camera, it doesn't come close to the FujiPix' colour -- I'm always tweaking fotos to obtain the best result. Neither does the Lumix take such good indoor fotos as the FujiPix. I suspect the reason for the difference lies in the lens, the larger Fujinon being way superior to the Panasonic Lumix Leica lens. The FujiPix is limited by lack of a wide angle lens 2MP max, although I still wonder how it takes such true colour high resolution fotos at this level. If Fuji could upgrade this camera to a 12MP, wide angle version I'd buy it. However, with the pace of technology I'm forced to look at more exotic cameras: best fit will be the FujiFinePix HS30EXR or the Canon Rebel T3. Any advice would be much appreciated!"
4,Gives you what it promises,Have had this camera for nearly 6 months and it has taken some fabulous shots. For the price tag that it comes in at - it is a neat buy. Also the 6x zoom (which was the feature that made me buy it) is just perfect (for me). On the downside it seems to have problems in low-light conditions (as almost all digital cameras do) and that is an area which leaves some things to be desired. Also since the 6x zoom is not stabilized you can use it only in the best of lighting conditions.All in all a great value for money and a good buy for enthusiasts who do not want all manual controls but do desire a lot more zoom power.
4,A 4.5+ Digital,"The Fuji 2800 is the smallest 2.1 meg. DC and has a 6X lens. The ergonomics are perfect provided you use your third finder to push the button for photos and not your index finger (which naturally falls over the On/Off button). My wife, the actual ""giftee"" is technically challenged. I needed a DC with simple to use ""point and shoot"" technology and this one delivers in SPADES! She is thrilled at the fact that it is NOT a rangefinder (she cuts off heads othewise) and that the screen is bright. Downloading is easy and Fuji appears quite committed in that they have a special user-only web site that is oriented to their customer needs. I am very pleased..."
3,Lens cannot retract,"When the camera worked, it was quite good. But the first time its lens was not able to retract, I was able to get it fixed under my credit card's extended warranty. Seven months later it happened again and it was out of warranty. And the repair shop was not able to find parts for it. I think Fuijifilm needs to issue a recall and refund. I am doubtful whether I should buy another Fuji again."
3,Anyone notice?,"Has any one notice the confussion between the shutter & power buttons??Or is it only me???I keep hitting the power (off) button when I want to take a picture, therefore loosing the picture.Good thing I haven't tried to take ""once in a life time"" photos yet.This is my only real complaint, enough for me to return the camera.I rate 3 stars due to the power button, 5 stars for everything elseOtherwise I agree with everyone els that this has great features and photo quality, for the price"
5,Best camera I've ever used!,This camera takes great outdoor photos and beautiful portraits. I recommend this camera to any amature photographer who is looking for a good camera with a low price. HAVE FUN!
1,Terrible vendor,Do not buy. Camera never worked shipped with missing and broken parts- vendor is MIA without response. Amazon gets 5 stars for their rapid response and credit card warantee.
1,JUNK CAMERA BROKE DOWN SAVE YOURSELF FROM TROUBLE,"I bought this camera two years ago for $400. It was taking good pictures except those issues with indoor and pictures at night. Now i suddenly get this zoom error and my camera refuse to retract the lens. I send it to fuji for repair. They want $140 for repair. Camera itself costs 200 now with one year warranty. I think this is junk camera with some cheap parts. don't buy this just, keep yourself away from the hassels."
5,First Digital & I love it,"I've been a photo hobbyist for Several years . Have owned several 35mms with a new Nikon my latest purchase just 2 years ago. Was not a big fan of digital but was sold when in the carribean and saw a realtime comparison of several different cameras. I SOLD !Very easy to use right away, great, clear images. Love everything about it. Sorry I didn't buy one earlier. I still love my 35. but now have a new traveling companion."
1,fatal error,Camera worked beautifully until somehow a fatal zoom error occurred. We can't get the camera to turn on again. Will not buy Fuji again!
3,Flash Card by Simple Tech,"The camera works fine other than in low light conditions where the image isn't visible in either the viewfinder or the lcd display. Don't make the mistake I made and buy a FLASH CARD. I thought this would increase the memory and it did not fit this camera. If you want memory purchase a memory card. Since I opened the card package and returned it, I'm sure it will be a costly mistake. If I were to do it all over again I would buy the Fuji 4800 for a few bucks more."
2,Horrible Quality,"Don't get me wrong, this camera takes great pictures. Very good quality even at the lowest setting. As everyone has said, the LCD is useless in low light, as well as the zoom function is akward unless you have rather small hands. BUT, here's the kicker, I have had the camera since Christmas, and today, I get ZOOM ERROR when zooming in to take a pic. I stop, and look at the camera and the lens seems to be crooked. So I tunr the camera off and when the lens is trying to retract it POPS OFF. I took it to Wolf Camera and they said it will have to be sent to Fuji....I would NOT reccomend this camera if you don't have time and money to hassle with repairs if the camera breaks."
1,No good,"I bought this camera and treated it very well. After a year and a half of low to moderate use, the lens won't retract."
3,Not a night camera,"This camera looks and works great, and for a long time, I had no issues with it whatsoever. The pictures were sharp, and of decent high resolution. Until I took this camera with me to Las Vegas, to take some night pictures. It worked fine when taking close-up night shots with a flash, but when taking long distance pictures, it became practically useless. First, distant images with flash enabled appear dark and blurry. If you disable the flash, images come out nice and colorful. Except they look like someone with Parkinson's disease was holding the camera - the lights are smeared everywhere - even if you stand still as a statue. Now, I know what you're thinking - ""just decrease exposure time"", right? I'd love to do that, if that was an available option.Of the 200 pictures I took, only 2 were useable (and even then, blurry)"
1,design flaw,"I've had this camera for a couple of years, and up until now have been pleased. The last time that I powered it up, the lense housing extended at a crooked angle, and I got a ""zoom error"" message. The camera is now inoperable. It seems many others on the web have experienced this as well. I contacted the nearest Fuji authorized repair center and was quoted $120 to fix the camera. I might as well buy a new one for that money (not a Fuji though)."
3,Fine Pix sometimes,"I am still learning all the aspects of my Fugi...and in most ways I have been very pleased. Picture clarity and the zoom is very good. I have noticed some trouble with reds and oranges coming out too dark. I am very dissapointed that what you want to capture while zooming is rarely what comes out, due to the delay in pressing the button and it taking the picture. Maybe with practice that will improve, I hope so. Well, after spending more time with my camera, I am now able to give it higher ratings. If you follow their directions about taking zoom photos, you can capture what you are trying to without missing much in the process. Pictures are clear and sharp. I still think reds and oranges are a bit off, but overall the camera is excellent."
1,It keeps breaking down,"I bought the camera 18 months ago (June/02). It has broken down twice. The first time (under warranty)was unable to download pictures from the camera to the PC. The USB cable would not seat properly where it connected to the camera. In any event, I had to send the camera to the Edison repair facility. It took 2 months for the camera to get back to me - no charge except the cost of shipping. The camera broke down again in September 03 (out of warranty). This time, no power - simply stopped working. So, once again, off to Edison, NJ for repair. I'm still waiting for the estimate.Maybe I have a lemon. I like the camera when it's working - it just seems to be spending as much time in the shop as with me."
5,First Camera I Have Purchased Since My Polaroid Instamatic,"Nice unit, It is not only great to be taking pictures again, but with this camera it is great fun. I researched digital cameras extensively before I purchased this one. Within Five minutes I was taking great pictures. It was very easy to figure out how to use it. I just kept saying ""WoW"" every time I downloaded another picture."
2,I have to vote thumbs down....,"This camera has some wonderful features, especially for the price. However, the big down fall is Fuji failed to incorporate an optical viewfinder. This makes it nearly impossible in very bright conditions (like the Arizona sun) and dark conditions (any indoor activity with low lighting) to see what you are shooting. You can point and re-take as many times as you need, but I missed too many shots this way. This was my third digital camera, and I returned it because although the prints were beautiful and clear, and I loved the zoom, it wasn't worth sacrificing my compositions for. I played with all the controls to try and adjust, but the only solution was either a tripod or bring your own lighting. I exchanged it for a Canon and am very pleased with it. It has less features and zoom, but at least I can set my picture up the way I want it, the first time. I do miss the XP picture card though- that was extremely fast download and shutter time."
3,the architect,"it is always interesting to see the hunky architect supreme in moving images, with his cigar puffing, suit sleeves rolled up and bald head shining glossily in dark construction sites. The script however, is quite remote from what we know Nouvel since his recent work in, for example, Spain (Agbar) and paris (Musee du Quai Branly).Of course the Nouvel we know (or at least as I understand / perceive) is still the same Nouvel, but there should a good DVD to witness his latest design."
5,Crane's Stationery,crane's writing papers are always excellent quality and make letter writing a pleasure. Ordering online was very simple and saved me a trip into the city.
3,Nice supplement for those responsible for system P&T.,"Very good theoretical overview of Solaris as it pertains to performance and tuning (P&T). Light on the emperical side, but thorough coverage of Solaris stats tools...covers what the man pages miss! High level coverage of capacity planning, mostly from a planning point of view; would still consider Brian Wong's book the authority in that subject. Nice adjunct for P&T's knowledge building for beginning administrators."
3,OK performance / capacity theory - some good Sun/based depth,"Does anyone edit anymore? Typos abound and even appear in examples of parameter setting. I realize there is value in ""speed to market"", but in this day and age, simple proofreading should be mandatory."
4,helping to preserve Tibetan traditions,"Worth listening, but a strong influence of contemporary Chinese music...The music communicates a focus on the heart as a point leading towards the awakening of all encompassing compassion."
4,Memory Aide,My son takes this in combination with Attend and Extress....it took a few weeks but it does appear to be having a positive affect.
3,seems to have a positive effect,"I started my son on memorin about 2 or 3 weeks after starting attend which seemed to work pretty well for him, it's hard to say exactly what effect memorin has but overall both seem to be working pretty well...better than anything else or any stimulant he has tried. no negative side effects."
5,Truly Amazing!,"If you like non commercial music, this is a must for you. Dreaming with ""Gela Alta"", with the purity of the artic regions, with a culture -The Inuit- who were going ""the other way around"" to reach Europa before the reach The New Continent""...this music is the kind that makes MEDITATION something sublime...you will see a civilization Who has managed to come to terms with desolation...the Blank Tapestry of the ice and the snow, will come to you, brining the calm...and the hiddent Inuit flute, will be more than da delight to your peace of mind. As The Movie is a masterpice which was not to be understood by masses, the music is a mix of classic and new age. No doubt, the image of the highly talented Julia Ormond will be coming to your mind, just looking for justice in a world lost to the ambition of the greedy. No doubt, this soundtrack is a must!"
4,Great selection,"I won't call this definitive, but the collection's got some previously unreleased and seldom heard numbers that merit the price and hype. This is a very listenable CD that's something you can just stick in the changer and let it play. Definitely worth the money."
4,"Best of ""The Best of...""","I have been a VM fan for years and listen to all of his music. This is the best of his three best of volumes because of the previously unreleased material and somewhat unknown duets with Tom Jones, James Hunter, Bobby Bland, Ray Charles, Carl Perkins, and BB King. It has something for the diehard VM fan as well as the occasional listener."
5,AWESOME!!,"This is an awesome CD....but then Van Morrison is usually awesome! I'm a HUGE Van fan, and I wasn't disappointed at all."
1,Mumbling Morrison,"Boy was I disappointed. Morrison's voice is not as good as it once was but on this album, and most recent ones, his nasal mumbbling is annoying and the lyrics ar unintelligible."
5,best of van morrison,"Great CD, this has a nice selection of his music. I attended his concert in Detroit last year and this includes some live recordings from his tour. One of my favorite CDs, he just keeps getting better"
3,When will Volume IV come out?,"Van just keeps 'em coming. Weakest of thevthree Best Of series. He's digging deep for this one. I'm a big fan, so I like it."
3,Disappointed,"I'm a big fan of Van Morrison but was disappointed by some of the ""updated"" versions of some of the old classics. Like a prior reviewer mentioned, the original versions (the songs I love and remember)are far superior to some of the modified material in this compilation. I will keep searching for a definitive ""Best of..."". I would recommend listening to all the song samples before buying the album to make sure you like these versions - something I failed to do."
2,Overrated,"As in The Scapegoat, Pennac has written a crime novel where the crime aspect isn't actually all that compelling. Pennac makes some hay with police racism, but it's nothing special in that regard. Once again, the translation doesn't really work for me and I'm sort of baffled by the notion that people found this book to be hilarious. Hard to imagine spending time on the third or fourth books in this series."
4,Great bag,I looked and looked for a bag that woudl fit my dell 8100 and this was really the only one I could find that was under [money]. its great but I I wish there were a couple of more pockets for CD's or disks etc.
4,Great...but the photos are wrong.,"This is a good bag. It is extremely well made with good padding. However the photos provided by the customer(s) are wrong. The photos above, show this bag to open up with zippers. this is INCORRECT. this is a top loading carrying case. The laptop is stored in a large pocket that is open at the top. I was disappointed becuase I saw the customer provided photos and I thought that was what I had ordered. Live n' learn from my mistake. Don't be fooled by the customer's photos."
4,"Lots of pockets, durable, compact, but...","...make sure they send you the color you want. Mine was not blue and black, it is ALL black. It's still probably the best bag I've ever owned, but I really wish it had been blue."
4,A+ laptop case,"Great case, love the filing compartment, but a bit heavy without laptop.Can't beat amazons pricing."
2,Not as good as I was hoping,Takes FOREVER to shave - and still doesn't get everything - still have to end up shaving with a razor. Frustrating - but good concept.
2,power-less,"The design is great, very light, easy to handle. It's very nice to be able to use it cordless. However, this is the least powerful epilator I have ever used in my 14 year of personal epilation history. (I have gone through six epilators.) It takes forever to clear a small area."
2,Doesn't work. Time consuming.,"I had bought this because I was tired of shaving, and too chicken to wax. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually work well. First of all, it hurts. I will admit that my skin is very sensitive, so that may have a lot to do with it. But It hurts unbelievably, especially if you do tender ares such as feet and armpits. I quit using it because of not only the pain, but in the time it takes to do one leg I could have shaved ten times. Its definately not worth the money."
2,I sent it back,It does good for the bikini area. However you have to hold it at a back angle for the tweezers to grab the hair properly. It did not work on legs at all. It would pull a few hairs and broke the rest. Without the guard it feels like it is scraping the skin. The tweezers area is so small it would take a week to finish a leg even if it did grab the leg hairs. Razor attachment does not work to my satisfaction.
5,well written survey of European military history,"the new version combines the 2 volumes into 1 handy volume and is full of information about various battlefields in Europe from Roman times to modern day (1900's). Contains summary information on many battles both important and obscure, Since I live in Florida its doubtful I will be able to visit any of the battlefields, if I did this volume is an excellent jumping off point to further research especially now with the Internet. Even if I don't it makes great armchair reading. Mr. Chandler uses a rating system judging the importance of the battle and its state of preservation and follows with a narrative of the battle written by himself or 20 other excellent military writers. Highly recommended."
4,RAVENOUS is Assembled in BLASPHEMY!!,"This is some raw, killer black/death metal at it's sickest! Killjoy of Necrophagia/Viking Crown does vocals on here, and they are pretty lame and weak... The chainsaw guitar is right up in your face, and the drumming is good. Also the production is pretty dirty, which suits this musick very well.. Most of the songs are killer.. some highlights.. 'Keep my grave open' , 'Dead cut up and ready..' The lyrics are ridiculous, though.. they mainly deal w/ gore themes, like cutting up a babe and then doing the nasty w/ her. heh.. I guess if you're into the whole perversity of gore, then you won't mind.. Anyway besides that, this album is decent, and definitely worth getting if you like bands like Necrophagia, Autopsy, etc. They need a new vokillist, though. :P"
5,A well Orson Welles.,"These interviews... They overlap and conflict with themselves, they run contrary to what we think we know about Orson. However they do make sense. The man is incredibly well read and so inteligent.Your reaction to this man and what he says is your own, I highly recomend this to you. From a point of view looking at how the book is compiled and the editor's job this book still maintains a 5-star rating. It is well put together from interviews that span his tumultuous career. Fantastic.I watched Citizen Kane again just before this arrived from Amazon. I read the book and then I saw one of Welles' later movies F for Fake (criterion and very highly recomended.) and that made the book and movies come to life in new and great ways.do yourself a favor and check them out! There is nothing like hearing what the artists have to say about their work! University Press of Mississippi has a very broad series of books with interviews of film makers. I recomend, as well, takign a look at them!"
2,Warning!!,"1968 is early Hendrix?? This cd duplicates what's found in ""Live at the Scene Club"" which duplicates what's found in ""Live in New York, 1968"" which duplicates what's found in ""Woke up this Morning and Found Myself Dead"". Worth maybe three bucks for a drunk Jim Morrison's ""F**k her in the A*s!"" and another dollar for a unique version of 'Red House' Look in the used record bin for these instead."
2,Average,as much as I Respect Jimi Hendrix this disc is a clunker.yeah there's some good Guitar work here but the title is very Mis-Leading.also Why would he Record with the Overrated Jim Morrison? only for Collectors.nothing worth Mentioning.
3,decent kit except,I teach college level art so I bought this kit to demo along with the students. They had the same kits. All is fine except that the screen filler cleaner really doesn't help. It's very hard next to impossible to reclaim the screen after the screen filler is applied. We had some luck with Arm and Hammer made into a thick paste and soaked onto the surface for about 10-20 minutes. At least a third of my class accidentally made holes in their screens trying to reclaim. The drawing fluid works well.
1,You'll be pleased for awhile.....,"Got this Black Friday 07 and for what was paid I couldn't complain. Descent pics, simple set up, even put a movie on there once just to see the performance. But alas just a little over a year later the frame went black!! Messed with it a little bit and finally threw it in a drawer. I recently discovered it again and tried plugging it in....And low and behold it works....For just a couple minutes at a time that is!! When I do get it to work I notice that the image quality has degraded (as othershave stated) and there is a crackling/buzzing sound heard every once and awhile. A quick search of the web and I've also found what others have found, absolutely no contact info for Astar what so ever. Even if you find this on sale or clearance save your money!!! I can't stress enough...SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Not only will this product eventually die but with the crackling/buzzing I'm hearing I would be afraid of something electrical that could build into a fire hazard!!!!"
1,Dead and smoking!,"Not the best quality pix. But it worked well for a few months,and it was a great conversation piece when quests came, until it died. I re-started it once with the remote, but got an even poorer quality with lines across the screen. Next time I tried it using the on-frame buttons, it not only did not work, but smoke poured out of two places on the back. It's value as a conversation piece would have sky-rocketed if it had set the house on fire."
3,"astar 7"" photo frame","Pros: Nice features, movie playback, mp3, slideshow and photos. For the price it seems a great value. This is my first photo frame and I expected TV-like picture quality. Cons: I'd have to rate the picture quality only average, w/limited control of brightness, contract and color. No internal memory or battery."
2,Died After 6 Months,The product worked ok until 6 months later when it suddenly burnt out & quite working. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,burned out,"the digital frame was given to us as a gift, which is a great idea! installation was a breeze, its pretty simple despite the engrish manual. however, within 6 months of being on for a few days straight, it burned out!"
3,"Pretty on the ouside, not so much inside.","This book is pretty to look at, the cover anyway. The inside is filled with images you have probably already seen before if you read ""Country Living"" magazine. Also the quality of the photos is a little on the blurry side. I recommend you skip this book and buy the magazine."
3,Duplication of 2003 book,A lot of the pictures in this book were also in Ms. Hueston's 2003 book which I have so it was a disappointment to me to spend money on a book that didn't have much new to offer. It seems to have a new cover which invited me to buy but not enough new pictures inside. I will be wary to purchase any more of this subject before checking it out in a store first.
2,Too many words; not enough pictures,"When I received this book I was dismayed to see that there were not a lot of photo examples included, and the ones that were included were small. I love the cover but the inside is just okay, not great."
3,"PRETTY, BUT NOT SO NEW COTTAGE...","While the book is well presented and with good photos, the cottage ideas are those we have seen so many times before in other books and home mags. I think it is a style that is difficult not to REPEAT...Perhaps if it is broken down into european and american elements or a combo of the two, it might seem a little fresher, but in general it a nice book."
2,Ok Album,"The Album is ok, three of the songs talk about mostly the same things, the other song is a different song all around. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge Cledus T. Judd fan I have all of his Albums. I just hope Cledus releases a full album in the near future.PS. This cd wasen't worth $9.00 I payed for it. His last cd was only around $6.00 and included six songs each one a different Parody."
3,alright,"Ok so I may be the only one left, but I am a true Dixie Chicks fan! And though I am a fan I think this is pretty funny. I'm sure they can take a few cracks...They have already taken quite a few."
1,"Simply stupid, get a life Cledus!","Cledus T. Judd was once funny at one time, but his overexposure on CMT has made him tiring. And why is it on this lousy 4 song CD all he can think to do is put down the Dixie Chicks, who are REAL country artists? I guess it's just because he's Toby Keith's best buddy. Maybe one song is to be expected, but four? You'd be better off throwing your money into the fire than wasting it on this CD. Do us all a favor Cledus and either get funny or just get out of the country genre altogether."
1,Stars Don't Go Low Enough,"I was looking at CDs the other day, trying to find the ""Top of the World Tour"" cd and what do I find; another cheap shot at the Dixie Chicks. When are people going to forgive and forget. I didn't even have to listen to it to know it would probably be trash. I feel sorry for any DC fan who thought it might be fuuny and wasted their money. Remember those who forgive are first blessed."
3,MOSTLY NEGATIVE,"alright, well at first the ring tone is loud, very loud, you can't lower the volume on that, the headset volume doesn't go loud enough...see something wrong with that? what else can i say?i got this phone because it was cheap, so i guess i got what i paid for, to bad we can't try out the things we wanna buy before we do. i don't know about battery life, but i talked on the phone for about 4 hours straight without a problem, and i don't think it works with call waiting, maybe you have to press flash, not the talk button. but i hope i helped. PEACE OUT!!!I ain't buy it on [amazon.com], ... ...you know the rest..."
5,Satisfied,We were surprised how easy this camera is to use. The quality of the images is good. We are happy with the product.
5,Delightful story,"Perfect for children as young as 2+, this charming and beautifully illustrated tale of a little girl and her favorite stuffed rabbit enchanted my three year old granddaughter. We read it about ten times over this past weekend. In addition to being a lovely story, the book served as her introduction to Paris and to a few new words both French and English. Highly recommended for imaginative children."
1,Problem with shift/CTRL keys,"I bought this from Office Depot and when I got home, I had a problem. When I hold down the shift key and type a couple letters, they all appear shifted, but if I pause for about 3 seconds, suddenly the shift key is ""unshifted"" even though I'm still holding it down. This is very annoying, and also happens with the CTRL key."
1,not for me,"The acting is just okay. The special effects are fine. Much of the story-line is unbelievable. For example, when the hurricane force starts-up on Mars, they just stand there and watch it...that's not normal...at least back away. And when the ship was hit by meteors and they saw all the damage, there would have to be other sensors that tell them the fuel tanks have been hit (it's supposed to be 2020; if they can go to Mars, then they have the technology). Although there isn't much swearing, they do take God's name in vain several times, which is completely unnecessary. And the worst was near the end (at which time I turned it off): They teach people that aliens and evolution populated the earth...both are lies. God created all things, and for His pleasure they are and were created. Only God is worthy to receive glory and honor and power. Revelation 4:11."
3,Sometimes great,"I generally like this product, but I have had a few glitches with it. A few times the cd wouldn't start. Other times I can hear the cd rotate over the music. I just hope this electronic item will stand the test of time, unlike so many other products I've purchased and used with care."
3,Cute concept. Sounds like it looks,"I wanted a small CD player for the kitchen. It does not fill the room at all, however, I like the size, and it can be discreetly tucked anywhere. Everyone asks, what's with the scale? when they first see this. THe sound is a bit too tinny, needs a better bass boost. I'm also a music buff, so this is merely suitable for the news, listening to favorite CD tracks, and keeping me company in the kitchen when I'm washing dishes."
4,Influential,"Levi is on the level of Agrippa in historical importance, and while not always practical, his influence cannot be underrated. THis is one of his most important works and is a MUST for any serious occultist."
2,For beginners only ...,"It's been a while since I've read the book but I remember my impression was that I paid too much for information that I already knew and some that I didn't agree with. This is a book for those considering or just STARTING a LDR. If you've been in a LDR for at least a few months or so, this probably isn't the book for you."
1,This book offers little to no expertise on the subject.,"This book was a quick and easy read -- written by a person whose only qualification for writing the book is that she's had a long distance relationship herself. I didn't mind reading it, although I must admit I didn't learn a thing. Too bad, too. It's the only book I could find on this important subject."
2,Song 2 . . . so what?,"Everybody loves Song 2, right? Well, if you really love that song, you DON'T need this! With this, all you get is the Album Version of that song, plus 7 other tracks, including nice accoustic versions of ""Country Sad Ballad Man"" and 2 others, plus an ehh remix of ""Beetlebum"" [and an instrumental of that], plus some other stuff that was kinda disappointing. Expensive; really, just for collectors."
1,"A book for therapists, not physicians","I am a physician in the process of establishing my own practice - and wanted some books to help me along this path. I have been part of a large group, and therefore have some real world experience in the private practice world. This book's author is a psychologist, and I found many sections of the book were just not applicable for a medical practice. For example, in the section on scheduling appointments, the leading suggestion is that the practitioner schedule his/her own appointments as a means of establishing a personal connection. This just doesn't jibe with the reality of a medical practice which has a much higher volume of calls and patients than a therapist - who probably sees 6 to 8 patients per day. Many other aspects of the book are therapist-centric, and either irrelevant or simply inaccurate for a medical practice."
3,What is missing?,"Over all a good book, but what happened to religion? Author leaves it out as a factor, which is strange given the title of this volume includes ""spiritual hunger"" in it."
1,Made me mad - no star,"This book just made me mad. Myers rounds up all of the usual suspects: divorce, pornography, the media, out of wedlock children, and tells us that our permissive, rights-oriented society is to blame. He hops on the Communitarian bandwagon without critical analysis of how one compels community and whether it would be worth the price.For example, he suggests, without a hint of analysis, that the 14th Amendment, rights of due process and equal protection, should trump First Amendment free speech. He hasn't a clue about how complex this argument is or where it would lead. Professor Myers claims impartiality as a ""social scientist"" when, in fact, the book skews the research to prove his point. Unfortunately, his ""point"" (our society is in the toilet - big surprise) doesn't lead anywhere."
5,Next best thing to freshly ground beans (or better than beans if you don't like messes!),"We use these pods with a Bodum Granos espresso maker with good results, so I assume they would work with any other machine that accepts ESE pods, as well. We find the flavor at least as good as the Starbucks and Illy pods, if not better. The pods are delivered in 48 individually wrapped packets packed together in a cardboard box, so I feel like they stay fresh longer than loose ground coffee or other pods that are not individually wrapped."
1,Less than 1 star!!!,"This movie was so bad its hard to even put to words. I watch all 6 short films and could not believe how very very bad they all were. It was like watching a train full of people crash. You don't want to see any more, but you keep watching hoping that it will have a good out come. Well let me tell you, this movie does not!!! SO SO SO, bad. Don't waste your time or money. I can't believe they even charge for this movie."
1,HATED IT!,"This is possibly the second worst Lesbian themed series of short films that I've ever seen. It's so unfortunate, since I am a connoisseur of this genre. I've only seen one that is worse than this one... I can't believe that it even made it to DVD. Don't buy this. If you want to get an idea of what's on it, go to Itunes, and download one or two of the short films on it. ""the Piper"" was STUPID and RIDICULOUS... and GROSS. ""the BOY"" was just lame. It could have been good if it wasn't about little kids. I did like ""Sarang Song"" but I hated the long drawn out dramatics of it. The other ones were so bad that I've forgotten what they were about. Just don't waste your money or time getting this."
1,painful,"This is so bad, that it's not even funny. There is no plot, bad acting . . . I can just repeat, don't do it."
2,Short stories,Not at all what I had in mind when I bought it. Afterall it was a collection of short stories. Only one I found interesting.
2,He Hates She Likes Girls,"What a waste of money OMG. These compilations suck. Go on youtube and you can find much better stuff than this. Some porn is worth having a ""hard"" copy--no pun intended, but this sucked."
5,Excellent tips on how to respond to a bully,"This is an excellent source to learn how to respond to any bullying situation that arises in the workplace or in every day life situations. This book helps to find your ""voice"" and not stay silent when someone tries their bullying techniques. Recommended."
5,Smart strategies that work,"Seems like everyone has a bully story to tell and Sam Horn's smart, practical strategies give heart and advice to those who are being victimized. Her imaginative chapter titles preview the creative how-to's inside. Her conversational tone does not patronize. It engages the reader, lets him/her know she understands the pain and the risk involved in being proactive against a bully. The audience for this book is wide: parents, teenagers, spouses, employers, employees, and the elderly. I learned a lot from it and thank her for writing it."
2,Danger,"I thought some of the techniques seemed like ones that would only make the situation worse. No wonder there is a big legal disclaimer at the front.I prefer the books by Namie & Namie, Patricia Evans, and Tim Field's website bullyonline.org."
2,rather naive,This book was written for people who are simple I feel bad for them if they read and believed what is in this book. If Bullies were that easy to deal with there wouldn't be any bullying
5,Take the Bully by the Horns: It really works!,"I purchased this book after I had several encounters with bullies throughout my life. I often failed at dealing with bullies, when I had to deal with them, until my last two encounters. For so long I tried the different typical tactics that Sam Horn explains and still suffered from the bullies' rath. What did I do during my last two encounters? I didn't compromise who I was, wasn't so nice and friendly and grabbed the bullies by the horns, as Sam Horn explains. It works and you can feel good about yourself and how you handled yourself throughout ""the ordeal"".This is even a great book for those who have learned how to handle bullies through trial and error, because it gives tips you wouldn't think of and boosts your confidence in regard to how you handled your situation. I highly recommend this book and just purchased another Sam Horn book. Her writing is easy to read, makes you smile and is extremely insightful."
4,poor tape quality spoils a wonderful story,"the original ""little bear"" stories are marvelous. This video preserves the sense of warmth and love that distinguish the books. This is a family that does things together. The Little Bear character embodies many of the traits of a typical toddler/preschooler. Mama and Papa Bear provide structure for a little bear discovering a wonderful and sometimes complicated world out there.Unfortunately, the tape is of very poor quality. I exchanged it once, but the new tape is just as bad. Luckily, my daughter doesn't seem to mind. My 3 year old daughter really loves these stories. She can identify with many of the concerns and delights that Little Bear experiences."
5,Great examples of character,"I checked out this tape at the library and after my 23-month-old son viewed it from beginning to end I went out and purchased Summertime Tales, Goodnight Little Bear and Friends. They are equally as good, but Family Tales is the best of them all. My son's great interest was in the different animals, duck, cat, owl, etc., especially since he's learned about most animals and the sounds they make...great reinforcement."

1,NOT '9 PIECE',"The ashtray I recieved is very nice. However, the description says '9 piece.' 8 more pieces are not coming. How can Amazon let this through?"
1,Listing not correct,Ordered 3 sets of 9 per set. Rec'd only 3. Sent in request for reorder or 21 more. Rec'd 3 (only) again. Not going to reorder.
1,it is only one cheap ashtray..not 9,the listing is for a 9 pack of these 99 cent store car ashtrays..you only get 1!!!!!needless to say..it is going back!
2,Quotation marks please!,"The single biggest problem I had with this novel was the authors decision to screw around with the standard form of dialogue. There are standards for writing in place for a reason. Opting not to use quotation marks, and to instead use dashes was highly confusing, and detracted from the overall story. Particularly since the dash (-) provided an opening, bit there was nothing to provide closure. A HUGE mistake, if you ask me."
3,Earlier example from the author,"This author is always capable of providing deep research and interesting facts.This example however, in my opinion, does not match the enjoyment I received from ""Great Tales from English History "".That example provided many moments of ""dip in' enjoyment."
3,"Serious but dated, lacking a contrarian perspective","Robert Lacey's book is a well-researched book that gives valuable insights into the history of Saudi Arabia and the mindset of its ruling family. Unfortunately, it lacks critical distance and paints an overly flattering portrait of the House of Saud, and should be balanced by reading Said K. Aburish's ""The Rise, Corruption and Coming Fall of the House of Saud"".My father worked with the USSR in the 70s and Saudi Arabia in the 80s, and he told me Saudi Arabia was the most stifling place he ever was in, even worse than communist Russia (this is not anti-muslim bigotry, by the way, I am one myself).A lot has changed since this book was written, due to demographic pressure and the collapse of the oil-driven welfare state after Gulf War I, so this book should be used mostly as a reference for the period before 1980."
4,A lively and dynamic history,"Lacey provides a colorful portrait of Arabia and the House of Saud, important players in history of the Middle East. Abdul Aziz ibn Saud and his descendants, ibn Abdul Wahhab, the Rasheeds, the Husains, Philby, Shakespear, and many others are vividly portrayed in a skillful narrative.Though first published in the early 1980s, this remains one of the best profiles of the land and dynasty."
5,An Excellent Near-Novelistic Introduction to Saudi Arabia,"An excellent introduction to the The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in an almost-novelistic, simplistic and non-controversial format, and an excellent collection of the vignettes and oral lore that comprise that history. This book provides a good base for understanding the historical, cultural, religious, political and economic background of the Kingdom. The book is a bit dated by this point (2001) but remains a great starting point for investigation of a complex society whose structure today is largely a mirror of a much older tribal structure. Very readable."
4,Content with this product,"We had one of these of unknown age and it broke when the bike toppled over - to much leverage on the plastic. We liked it enough to replace it, and now we have the ""rack"" on both Mom and Dad's bikes and one seat. I've used both front-mounted and rear-mounted seats and neither is ideal - it's a little awkward and wobbly one way, versus the other. But biking with the child is still wonderful. This doesn't hold that big a child, our girl is four, petite, about 30 lbs, and her legs are down at the bottom of the ""holsters"" for her feet. I think this is a good model, the price is good, and it gives you a ""rack"" you can use with a bungie cord for carrying this or that instead of the child seat. Easy to mount on and off."
1,Locking-in mechanism too good,"This seat is OK. My only complaint is the locking mechanism, which requires you disengage two levers in both the front and the back. While this certainly reduces the chance that the seat will fall off, there is also makes it very difficult to remove. I actually fractured a finger while trying to remove it, lodging it between the provided rear rack and the front latch of the seat (and I am NOT a clumsy person). had to have surgery, a pin, PT, etc...To bypass this problem now, I use a flathead screwdriver to press down on the lever so my hands are nowhere near that connection!"
4,Good Seat,Good quality seat that was reasonably easy to install. Great that you can remove the seat and use the cargo rack.
2,May not work for your bike,I could not mount the bike rack on my very normal bike with the parts included. Copilot does not carry a list of compatible and incompatible bikes. I had to pay a bike tech to jerry-rig a solution.
3,Great child seat! Incredible comfort!!! I wish it had more room for my child.,"I was a little skeptic on this seat, not because of safety reasons (it comes with more than enough designed measures to keep the seat tightly attached to the bike), not because of size either -although my seat rests about 10 inches from my childs face when riding-. I was concerned about comfort and that my child (she's 2 years old) could ride comfortably during long rides. I've been riding with my child in her seat for about two weeks, in about 2km/5km rides every time. She even rides singing and admiring the scenery. Yesterday she even took a nap when riding... and we arrived home with her snoring!!! So... yes, it's a confortable seat.If I could ask for something, it would be more face-room for her, but I guess my bike is not long enough. Leg room could also be improved, since my feet get too close to her toes, and sometimes both of my heels brush her toes when pedaling. I keep feeling my bike is short in dimensions."
1,My 2y1/2 son broke it,"That says a lot about the quality! My son took the ""grab bar"" and just snapped it out of the seat So much for a security feature.And it is very difficult to lock the seat on the track. Fortunately I don't have to remove the seat but otherwise I would have considered returning this item."
1,Make sure it fits your bike's geometry,"I purchased this seat for my commuting bicycle (a converted Giant cyclocross bike). It simply doesn't work with my bicycle's frame geometry. Neither my bike mechanic nor I could get the bottom of the seat to sit parallel to the ground. The seat exhibited a *significant* backward tilt ... so much so that I was afraid to put my daughter in because I thought the fasteners/fittings might not be adequate to support her weight in that configuration. I had nightmarish visions of the seat becoming detached and falling backward while I was pedaling. I'm sure that the seat would work fine for most bicycles. But it my case, it was a waste of money."
4,"good seat,feet straps could use some improvement","It is a good seat. My 2 year old seems to like it. The straps for the feet are awkward to use, but otherwise we like it."
3,Beautiful glass with a major omission.,"Fine pictures with solid historical copy. I would rate ""The Art of Glass"" five stars if it were't for the exclusion of the glass of Frederick Carder, not only a major contributor to the genre, but designer/maker of some of the most beautiful glass objects of any period ever made."
1,Save your money. It is not a computer photography handbook.,"A clever title as far as marketing is concerned.Very misleading, not very informative about anything. If this book is for anybody it would be for the person that just heard of computer photography for the first time because all it does is tell you about the different prodcts available and a couple of paragraphs about them. There is not ""how to"" about anything. The book may have some value not worth more than 9.95. Anyone will learn more from another book."
3,A good browse but short on information,"This brightly colored overview of communication that takes students from the beginning of language to the Internet is great for browsers. Each spread has several photographs with captions containing curious facts. The easy-to-read text is blocked in chunks making it easy to pick and choose what you want to read. Each chapter ends with a comparably bland page with a summary and a box with hyperlinks, career directions, and places to visit, easily skippable. The book contains a note at the beginning saying that they cannot guarantee the stability of the links, but the instability of the Internet is not addressed in the book, which is just one example of the areas left untouched by this book. There isn't really enough information in this book for anything more than casual browsing. Kids in grades 4 through 6 will like the references to Harry Potter and other trivia, but this is no DK book, just an imitation."
5,Powerful Stuff,"The reading of this book was an eye-opener, and I originally read this to gain insight into the offenders I deal with, but after I began to read, my heart broke as I discovered what this woman had to suffer at the hands of her father. This is an incredible journey, and it is not recommended for the weak of heart or those who already have an axe to grind or people to punish. This reading requires compassion, empathy, and understanding, with the hope that its impact will help others to heal or work through the trauma it represents. Highly recommended!!"
4,Good.Product,It is a good product. Don't expect to get healed because of this. It is rather to avoid pain or overuse of the wrist (I have tendonitis).
3,Comfortable but falls off my computer tray.,"This wrist cushion is fine for me in terms of cushioning, except that with my tilted ergonomic computer tray, it falls to the ground constantly. It would help me if it had some sort of flat or sticky base."
3,Quality Has Gone Down,"This replaced an older one that I had worn out. This one doesn't even come close to the quality of the old one, especially because there are so few beads in it now that they shove over to the sides, putting my wrist back down directly on the table. If I fold over the extra fabric (if it was filled properly, there wouldn't be extra), it becomes useable, but it quickly returns to it's normal flat, unuseable state. Save your money."
1,its not the same product from local store.,"imak from amazon is smaller and softer compared to my original imak wrist cushion.Went to check the near local store and found full size and better support for little more price.IMO, imak cushion from amazon is different product and it does not function well as wrist cushion.Need to let buyers know this product is smaller and softer version, compare to its original."
3,Why so small?,"I have arthritis so bad that the cartilage in my wrists is non-existent and my wrists do not bend so support is important to me. I had previously owned a Imak Ergobeads Wrist Cushion and really liked it. However, I had it for so long that the material had gotten holes in it and the beads were falling out. I decided to buy a new one, but when I got it was disappointed that it's much smaller than my original one. I'd be afraid to see what their intentionally small ones look like. I'll be on the look out for these in my local stores to see if I can find a full size one."
5,"Just right in every way, right out of the box.","After reading other reviews I tried this wrist rest and another. Both arrived together in the same shipping package and I was excited to try them out and get (hopefully) some relief from wrist pain and a bruised 'palm heel'. It didn't take me long AT ALL to decide I liked this one (Imak Ergobeads Wrist Cushion) better. The other one (Handstands Add-A-Pad Wrist Cushion) works as advertised and for the most part is fine, but for my tastes it is just a little too full and therefore not as flexible and so my wrist rests ON it and seems too high off the desk. With the Imak my wrist is cradled in it and supported just a little off the desk. The Imak is a few dollars more, but well worth it in my book! Just using it for two days has provided some level of relief! I'll be buying a couple more for use at work."
2,Beads move around leaving no support,"The product just isn't very good for its purpose. I now have to buy another gel one because this is just pretty much useless to me. Both the mouse support and the keyboard support. I bought matching, naturally. I still end up having to hold my wrists up because the beads inside of the product migrate over to either end within a minute or two and my wrist is sitting on the table again. There just isn't much support."
3,An OK product,"When I place my wrist on top of it, I feel a little too ""thick"", I mean I dont feel very comfortable controlling my mouse with it.Now I use it everyday at work as a stress ball - its perfect for that type of usage. Should market it that way."
3,Zulu War study,"A reprint of this extremely scarce account, first published in 1883. Mitford, a writier and Cape Civil servant, toured all the Zulu War battlefields when much debris and relics were still in place, and descibes with a great flair what they looked like, a boon to the Zulu War enthusiast of today. He also talked with many important Zulu Chiefs and warriors, and presents their accounts of the war, a rare commodity. Ian Knight adds a series of photos taken of the battle sites as they look today. London 1992 r/p of 1883 ed, Greenhill , UK ed w/dj, 6 x 9, xxvi, 257 pp , illus."
5,great!,"this even better then their offcial live album rude awakeningespecially the solos and vocaljust wish it was cheaper, but since it's really rare it still worth buy"
3,"Decent live EP, now available with Psychedelicatessen","This out of print live EP features songs from Threshold's first two albums -Wounded LandandPsychedelicatessen. It contains the following tracks:1. A Tension of Souls2. Sanity's End3. Innocent4. Surface to Air5. ParadoxFortunately, the EP was included as a bonus disc on the Special Edition reissue of Psychedelicatessen, so there's no need to pay for an expensive import version."
5,"Finally, The Ultimate Lost Sock Treatise","Harry S. Robins, who is also known as the voice of various scientists in Half-Life, and plays Dr. Kleiner himself in Half-Life 2, here expounds on a matter of pressing importance...especially pressing to socks pining for their mates.For fans of Half-Life, as well as wearers of socks, purchase of this volume is mandatory!"
5,With the warm vocals of ANN CURLESS (Expose) This CD rocks!!,"Andrew here from Canada, well everyone what can I say about this record? For one it's absolutely perfect...for one simple reason: It features three tracks by the multitalented ANN CURLESS. Her vocals are warm and deep. She brings songs like ""Lately"" and ""Open arms"" new meaning. The freestyle track ""One"" is especially remarkable. I know that there are a lot of Ann Curless fans out there. So folks, there you have. A great dance CD. Buy it now! Look out for a new remix of ""Lately"" released by Rampage records. It contains a B side dub of ""Point of no return"" where Ann sings a few lines from the dance classic."
3,Roemers best?,"This is probably Bills best of his Chicago mob books.Some would say that he should have stopped with this one.You can completely forget about the second.The books covering Tony Spilotro and ""Joe Batters"" Accardo were just O.K. One of the best books on the outfit is Gus Russos' ""The Outfit"".Read it before you read any others."
2,CONSTANT LINE NOISE,"All the features on this phone are great except you can't have it close to a computer, you can't have any electronics on or you get constant line noise. According to their Customer service, you have to have the phone 9 feet away from your computer. If you have to work on your computer, how can you use the speakerphone? I moved my phone 9 feet away and I still get line noise! Time to get a new phone!"
4,Great while it lasted,"I have had this phone for two years and loved it because it is one of the few with a speaker phone in the base plus a dual keypad. I sometimes need to make conference calls from home and it was perfect and unlike some other people I never had any interference despite having the laptop right up against the base unit.It also lets you set different ring tones for different numbers so you know when it is work versus your family calling. has built in do not disturb light, intercom function, hold etcIf I hadn't dropped the handset into the sink of soapy water I would keep it. Alas is is no longer mfg and there isn't a good replacement"
5,love this book!,This is a very well written book that will get the wheels in your brain turning! Dan Brown is an amazing writer.
4,Battle Spike Batman,This product arrived in excellent shape. The seller was prompt in sending the toy. I bought it for my grandson as a gift and he was very happy with it. He has gotten a lot of enjoyment from this toy.
2,Shoddy,"I have to write that this was a waste of my money. There is no life in this music, and I'm used to hearing good things from these guys. Its too bad that the Sisters of Mercy only have three other studio outputs which are very good (First last and Always, Floodland, and Vision Thing) I know this is some of they're very early work but it would have been better if this stayed in the closet."
