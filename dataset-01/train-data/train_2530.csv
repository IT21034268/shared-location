2,Not a good workout,If you want a really good workout that works try the FIRM! :) These just have loud music and moves that don't seem to show any results. Good luck.
1,RIP OFF,"WHEN I RECIEVED MY PACKAGE I OPENED IT UP AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT ONE DVD WAS BENT UPWARD ALL THE WAY AROUND IN A BOWL LIKE SHAPE. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS, THERE IS NO WAY THAT WILL SIT FLAT ON THE DVD PLAYER. I WAS RIGHT! THAT DVD WAS DAMAGED AT SOME POINT AND WOULD NOT SIT FLAT ON THE DVD PLAYER AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE READ BY THE DVD PLAYER. THE OTHER DVD IN THE SET WAS FINE THOUGH SO I'M NOT SURE HOW ONE WAS DAMAGED AND ONE WASNT. I WAS EXTREMELY DIASAPPOINTED WITH MY PURCHASE AND WOULD NOT BUY FROM THAT SELLER AGAIN!!! I PAID FOR A COMPLETE SET OF DVD'S BUT ONLY RECIEVED ONE THAT WORKED. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
1,"Never received product from ""fashiondiva"" or response as to why she never sent my order. its been over a month!","I never got a chance to try the product nor have I received a response from ""fashiondiva"" the merchant. She never sent the product and refuses to respond to emails and its been over a month!"
3,Hip Hop Abs,This woud have been a 5 star rating but I can not use it. I do notrecommend a used product from now on. It has a major scratch in itmaking it not able to play. If I could actually use it I am sure it would have been good. Just as the workout starts the dvd startsskipping making me crazy!!!
5,Very invigorating,"These are great videos if one has a sense of rythm. My husband hated them, but then again he hates dancing as well. I loved the work out but will say that they can be very challenging for someone just starting out or with any physical limitations. The key is sticking through the hard times and you will notice a difference in your overall endurance and physique. Great cardio, core and overall workouts!!"
3,A low impact workout,"Hip Hop Abs is not as high impact a workout as I anticipated. It is a fun workout to use on my ""rest"" days."
4,"Fun, hilarious! But, difficult for 2 left feeters.","These workouts seem to be fun, and will definitely help me in the long run with coordination. Keeping your abs ""tilted, tucked and tightened"" would yield results, I think, but it's sometimes hard to maintain the energy you see in the videos. I'll keep it up and see what happens. At the worst, it's decent cardio. At the best, I'll have flat abs!"
2,Hip Hop Abs,"The Seller was wonderful, but as far as a workout goes.........no burn. Too easy. 8 minute abs is so much better."
4,Excellent and Fun,This is a fun and great way to start exercising or maintain an exercise program.Do not be fooled by the dancing. These workouts are intense if you move and form your body to his instruction. This is perfect for people that like to have fun and do not like the same old boring routine.
1,Not good,"I figured these dvd's would be great because I love Beach Body (specifically Brazilian Butt Lift), but this set was not good. I didn't feel anything in my abs and the moves were kind of weak."
4,quick shipping,"I received very quick shipping, however the case was slightly damage, but I would definately buy from them again."
4,Great DVD and Fast shipping!,Received the DVD in a rather quick time frame. Especially since it was during the holidays. It was exactly what I wanted.
1,Not what I had hoped for - Too Easy,"Ok, I had hoped for a fun way to really work my abs, but this just isn't it. The music is horrible and it's barely a workout. I have done P90X, P90X2 and Insanity (but still I'm far from a pro/ athlete) so going from those to this is a joke - And I was even using this as an add-on workout! It's slow and I didn't feel any real abdominal workout... Maybe it's because I'm used to more strenuous workouts, but this was a joke to me. Also, I didn't enjoy Shaun T. as a trainer on this video - He comes across much differently than he does on the Insanity series. The whole video is cheesy."
1,It is OK,"no inches melt away. you would have to do this for a very long time to get good abs. Not very difficult. I'm overweight and out of shape and it is not that difficult for me. Not much of hip hop either. I'm sure there are much better videos that work the body a little harder. Tilt, tuck, tighten is a joke."
3,"Its okay, I guess",I used the dvd twice and it is okay but I dont think it is something that i would do everyday so on with the search for a workout dvd that fits me.
4,Great end results,I love the videos. I love how easy it was to learn the steps. Which for me was surprising because sometimes I can be uncoordinated but these videos made me feel very confident.
4,Good Workout,"I like this workout. Very easy and low impact. I tried it awhile ago and got good results. Now I moved on to his Insanity Set and I actually use them together. For example, I just did insanity Plyo cardio with Abs Sculpt. I love me some Shaun T!!!"
4,I like this work out. It is energetic and will work the abs if one keeps the form . The instructor is fun and easy to follow.,I recommend this set of DVD's for anyone who has back pain with conventional down on the ground crunches. This is a great way to do ab work without stressing out the low back...but only if you keep your core tucked in and tight.
3,silly fun,"i didn't get alot out of it, maybe i just wasn't getting it, hope it helps you if you try it."
2,good music,"I liked the upbeat vibe from this, but I didn't feel like there were any people that looked like me. They all had great abs, and I never felt like I was doing it right, because I didn't look like them."
2,Hip Hop ABS,"This workout is hard to take seroiusly with Shaun T's silliness, his lisp and his affected East Coast pronunciation. If you are looking for a guy that is just one of the girls, then this is your workout. ""Hey ya'll"""
1,disappointed,"When first seeing this item, I thought what a fun and hip way to lose weight. After purchasing the dvd I was dissappointed. The guy leading the excercises was so arrogant and feminine acting that it became annoying. The routines that we doing although aerobic, I didn't feel that it worked the ab area as well as other excercises I have tried. So save your money, it's not worth buying."
2,Too much crouching of the upper body.,"I know what the charismatic Sean T. is trying to do: get the abs to do what they're designed to do, which is, among other things, to curl the upper body. The problem is that his technique only accentuates the upper-body (thoracic) curvature, which is already exaggerated in so many of us. At least it doesn't put the strain on the neck that the horrible crunches and even worse sit-ups do.Instead, learn Pilates and try practicing the Pilates breathing on a mini-trampoline (please don't hurt yourself on a cheap one--ReboundAIR is the most reasonable high-quality rebounder) while bouncing as if you have the slightest slant board behind you. Or sitting bounces. Wow--4 min. and I can see & feel the difference. I only do this targeted ab work a couple of times a month 'cause I'm not terribly diligent, and I have a flatter belly now at age 57 and 2 kids than when I was age 30 (I have the pictures to prove it)."
1,This was a rip off,This product was obviously burned by a third party as it wouldn't play all the way through. It would stop then start and then skip to the end. I had to throw it away.
1,Not ment to be,I recently bought this product to get in better shape and have some fun...it came with two videos. One of the videos didnt work on any DVD player or even my computer but John with Zunshop whom I bought it from was awsome and replaced that video for free. Then when I received the new video it worked the first day and after that it would not play on any DVD player or computer so I sent them back. I guess it was just not ment to be. Cudos to John with Zunshop but as for the video my experience was not good!!!
3,"Warning - Order from Amazon, not from BeachBody website!","If you are going to order the product at all, definitely order it from Amazon.com.I didn't heed others warnings about the underhand and unethical selling techniques the maker (BeachBody Fitness) of this product employ. As I was completing the purchase of the videos from the BeachBody website, they put the purchase through before they even showed the total amount that would be charged.When I called them to cancel the order, which I placed on a Sunday, after finding out they were charging me why more that described, they told me that even though they had not send the purchase order over to the shipping department they could not stop the order. I also talked with a manager there for about 30 minutes with no luck.When the package showed up I had to refuse delivery, and it went back to the BeachBody shipping warehouse, but they still charged me $13.73 for shipping.Don't order direct from BeachBody's Website!!!"
2,"Okay, but didn't keep my interest.","I love hip hop and R&B but this workout DVD didn't keep my interest long enough. Plus, I felt like I was getting the same workout just by running or jogging. I wasn't sore the next day-which is something I look for to ensure myself that I'm getting a good workout (just started working out)."
4,easy dance moves,I like it. The dance steps are easy and it is fun. The music isn't songs like you hear on the radio like the infomercial says but it still keeps you moving. My midsection has become flatter and tighter after just a few weeks.
1,sculpting dvd hurt my back,"The dance moves are ok fun not that intesne as far as cardio goes. The reason I am giving the low rating is becuase the sculpting dvd hurt my back. There is a move called the ""weighted ab crunch"" which you are standing up. The only part gettin the weights is the jarring movement to your upper back it doesnt even use the weights in a way that would work your abs. Be careful"
2,ugghh!,"These videos WILL work your abs, but nothing else on your body. I don't find any use for a workout that will only work my abs and leave me with flabby arms! The music is terrible too. No real hip hop songs here. Everything is to a ""fabricated"" hip hop beat. No singing (unless you count Shaun T telling you who he is in sing-song, which I actually consider to be annoying), the videos play the same repetitive song/beat the whole time. I was thouroughly sick of it after 20 minutes. I had high hopes for these workout, I thought they sounded like fun. I am sad to find that I was extremly dissapointed. To the reviewer who said he is kind of like Will Smith? Those two should not even be mentioned in the same sentence. I love Will Smith, but would be perfectly happy to never see Shaun T again, or hear that horrible ""music"" either!"
5,best ab workout ever!,"Shaun T is an amazing instructor who makes it fun. He makes it where you don't want to quit no matter how bad it burns. I ordered Hip Hop Abs and his Rockin' Body three weeks ago and I already see a big difference. I've lost in my waist and hips, my thighs are tightening up, and I feel better overall! The workouts are fun and the music has a good beat to it. I hate to work out to the same ol boring everyday but this keeps you moving and its amazingly fun, fun, fun! If the floor is not your idea of a fun workout this is for you!"
4,Hip Hop Abs,This is the exercise for rainy outside days so it can be done inside. Good exercises too. Seller was wonderful in the shipping and the price on the item was spectacular!
3,Just OK,"I watched the DVD before actually trying it. It was better as entertainment than a good workout. After using it for about a week, I did not feel any difference in the ab area, but my knee (which already has a problem) hurt. I had to discontinue use because for some reason, this exercise put too much pressure on my knee. I think it was all the bouncing that needed to be done."
2,Disappointed.....,This video did NOTHING for me!! It made me sweat a lot....with certain parts....but it did nothing for my body!
1,Not worth $1,"I tried this and never felt like it helped me at all. In my opinion, if I were working out my abs I would've felt the muscles burn, at least a little, but I felt nothing except frustration that I wasted my money."
1,Can't Say This Was Productive...,"Nice concept, but really, i don't think you should waste your money. I tried it for a week, and i say it's something nice to do, but not so productive if you're wanting the results the commercials show you."
1,UNSAFE AND NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"Any kind of safety modifications for beginners is glaringly absent. The ""Abs"" section is the best of the worst, with the cardio workouts being too fast, too hard to follow, and with absolutely no safety tips at all. I've been a physical therapist and aerobics teacher for 15 years and Beach Body deserves a great big thump on the head for not going a little bit further to make this product safe for ALL levels. Skip this overhyped white elephant and buy something from Kathy Smith or Karen Voight to get a good workout without injury."
3,Not original,The product I received seems to be a reproduction even though I ordered NEW. There was no film protecting the DVD and that was my first clue that something was amiss with this shipment. It also took quite awhile for me to receive my DVD.
4,Title,"I purchased a new video, but was sent a used video. The company promptly resent a new video. Thanks"
1,not a real workout,"I want to be honest here, and for some reason people get offended and like to mark down this review...But I still stand by what I said earlier:If you are someone who exercises on a regular basis, you will not benefit from this ""workout"", there is absolutely no intensity."
2,Fun but not for everyone,"If you are a beginner, you might enjoy Hip-Hop Abs. But if you were exercising regularly prior to this program, you will hardly break a sweat. I bought this to replace the Kenpo and Abs routines when I did my second round of P90X. I regretted buying Hip-Hop Abs. I think it is too expensive relative to the fitness value it offers."
4,Shaun T is great!,"I have been doing hip hop abs for a couple months now and I really enjoy it! My favorite part is that the none of the workouts are super long. Total Body Burn is the longest one and it is 45 minutes. Shaun T makes smile throughout all of the workouts. It really makes the workouts fly by even faster. The tilt, tuck, tighten method works great for me. I've lost 12 lbs. and I can definitely see that my waist and thighs have gotten smaller.No, the music isn't actually hip hop music, but it's still good workout music. I actually really enjoy the music.The only bad thing that I really have to say about it is that when you choose to have ""Even Louder Music,"" the beat of the music is off with the moves as you watch the screen. So if that kind of thing bugs you (like it does for me) then stick with the lower music volume and louder verbal cues. It's more fun that way for me anyway because Shaun T's commentary is so entertaining!"
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","I have a large amount of weight to lose (105 lbs) - and I love to dance, so I thought, why not try it? I LOVE THIS!!! It is so much fun, and for the first time ever, I actually look forward to waking up at 5am to work out. And trust me, I am NOT a morning person. I have lost 30 pounds so far, I love every work out on here. My favorite is the fat burning cardio. If you don't like to dance, you may not like this. But after Taebo, Tahitian hip hop, Jane Fonda Collections, etc - I was ready for a change."
3,Great moves - poor hiphop/rap-ing,"Now don't get me wrong. The moves are great hip-hop moves. But from someone who has been working within a Hip Hop culture - I have never heard such bad hip hop/rap in my life!The moves are sweet - definitely, for those with dance experience. So, take your time learning the moves. I agree with a few others here, there is no basic learning cycle. So, watch, learn and keep up.It is great fun, if you have the music overwhelm the instructor. :-) Enjoy the workout."
2,just blah,"Since I love taking hip-hop classes at the gym, I ordered this thinking that I would totally enjoy it. The first time I did it, I thought that maybe I was doing it wrong because I didn't really feel anything- no soreness at all. I did it for several more days and still, nothing. Doubting my experience, I watched the instruction video again, and then tried it again for a week- still little to no soreness. To be honest, after a couple of days I also found Shaun T to be increasingly annoying. This was definitely not the workout video series for me."
3,its okay,I really could not get the ab workout this video offers. I didn't get the movement right or something so it was more like just dancing unfortunately. If you are not beginner you may want to look elsewhere.
1,Loch Ness Madess,"This book ia a far fetched story of 3 scientists who investigate the Loch Ness Monster and end up discovering a hole in tme. The book advertises about a threat the military has never seen before. Well the only thing never seen is the military!! No where to be found in this book. Well unlesss you count the United Nations. Don't waste your time with this book. If you want an entertaining story dealing wih worm holes/holes in time, read Star Trek."
2,Moderately entertaining but bad ending,"Started off pretty good with a lot of suspense and kept me wanting to read it, but during the last quarter it just dies. The ending is one of the worst I've ever read, but the fact that during the last quarter of the book you can TELL it's going to be a bad ending just ruins it.Seems like the author just got tired of writing and cut it short by a hundred pages or so as there's never any military or saving of the world like the books description says.The first 3 quarters of the book were good, and it had an interesting concept but I have to give it a 2 because of the sudden ending that left me feeling disapointed."
1,I agree with the other reviewers,The book starts off well. I had grabbed the book on my way out of a store and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the writing and the interesting characters. But then the story quickly deteriorated and ended abruptly. Like others I was also annoyed by the cover's promise of a military threat that never materialized. No helicopters either.
4,A book You won't put Down,"Preston's parents had a perfect marriage. They were always happy, until they started to fight. The fights were hurtful, mean, and vicious. Mrs. Scott Preston's mom moves out and goes live with her sister Jackie. Preston starts to have nightmares about his mom.Three years later Preston's dad is getting out of prison and Preston is in dolt. How can he forgive the man who killed his mom? Travel with Preston has he struggles through faith, fears, and love as he struggles to forgive or forget about what his dad did. How can his grandparents be so forgiving towards the man that killed their daughter and Preston's mom?"
3,Cassie Maas,"I enjoyed this book because it was the first book that was partially true and gave an insight on how someone deals with a tragic and surprising loss of someone close to them. I don't think I could ever forgive my father if he shot my mother. It would be hard to look at your father everyday and think, ""You killed mom.""I would recommend this book if you would like to see how a young adult dealt with the loss of his motherat the hands of his own father."
1,Bored me to Tears,This book bored me to tears. You keep on waiting and waiting until the end. A shocking end but stupid end. I waited for a boring end!
4,"Wake up and smell the ""Tele""","Does your ego get in the way of appreciating someone you never heard of? Mine sometimes does, but let me tell you, Arlen Roth is for real.I just got this book yesterday, and it's great. The first thing I noticed was how extremely well coutry licks carry over into rock. Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top came to mind quickly.Arlen is a Telecaster fanatic, so he goes a bit overboard in calling everyone who's ever been seen with a tele a ""telecaster player,"" but that doesn't take away from the lessons.I've got a tele-type guitar on order right now-a left handed G&L ASAT Deluxe. I am counting th days 'till I get my hands on it!"
3,Super Reader,"A man is on death row. He didn't do what he has been convicted for, being the murder of his lover. Being a photographer of kinky stuff didn't really help his cause.However, The Crow is lurking, and realises that there is a wrong to be avenged. When Jared comes back, the outfit and places they go will be right up his alley, though."
2,I'm glad this was a fast read,"For some reason I found myself not really into the story.Maybe it was the slow process,characters,or development. Often I found myself just flipping thru pages,until I found something with Jared(crow),and the bird seem kinda passively involved. I felt brief excitement though fleeting at the end. The crow mythology was a great touch I really enjoyed that aspect. I'd give 5***** on that all by itself. The wearing of the tragdey mask,made me think of Jason in the Friday the 13th series. Overall I feel I wasn't ready for a more kinder gentler crow."
1,Enough Already!,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Brite's early work showed promise, but her writing's simply gotten pretentious, and the characters are a weak rehashing of themes she's dealt with before. As a woman, there's nothing about this book that appeals to me...but maybe it isn't supposed to. I'm still waiting for some truly dark, twisted, atmospheric horror."
5,the kind I'm likely to get,"Ken Foster has exposed the hidden pain of being a lost thirty something. In a generation of misfits struggling between the slick era of mobile phones and on line dating, Ken Foster has created chracters that portray the enduring irony of a global existence. In between skinny lattes and short stories Mr. Foster has the ability to deliver humor and devestation in the same sentence. The prose are well crafted and each word is carefully selected to give the reader a sense of belonging. The characters intermingle between stories with such ease it is hard to believe that ""the kind i'm likely to get"" is not a full breathing novel. The major flaw with the collection is that Mr. Foster has pointed out so many of our own adult faults it can be difficult to digest in one sitting."
1,The worst Crow story ever!!,This is definately the worst one there is. I didn't think the characters were at all likeable. The only person kind of likes was the bad guy since he had a cool character.
3,Really did not meet my expectations,"When I first heard about this book I thought that it would be excellent. The combination of the Crow and Brite's always convoluted and strange writing would be a sure winner. To put it mildly I was greatly disappointed. This was an interesting story, but it lacked the usual edge and suspense of Brite's other efforts, especially Lost Souls and Drawing Blood. I had expected much more and I cannot get over the impression that the author skimped on what could have been an excellent addition to the Crow storyline."
2,Better Then Quoth The Crow But Still Lacks..,"Yet again, another one of my reviews, this time for The Crow Lazarus Heart. Like Quoth The Crow, I enjoyed the love story although this one felt less forced and more natural. But as soon as Brite got to the villian,""Joseph Lethe"", I felt very confused. Now, I can understand having a villian that thinks their justified but this one was just overall confusing. Talking about a lightning bolt that changes his brain? Not a very good reason/explanation. This book I also would not recommend to anyone. At this point, I'm already onto Clash By Night. On a general note, none of these books have attempted to ""push the envelope"". I will give Brite some credit for trying to add change to the story. And to the reviewer who made the note about the cop, well, I agree."
3,The Crow: The Lazarus Heart,"The Crow: The Lazarus Heart was a very interesting book to read. I like the fact that The Crow came back and not really knowing why he's come back until it was close to the end of the book. He is one stubborn fellow. The only flaw that I had with the book is that the writer tended to bounce to soon between each character and it seemed to me that she centered it to much around the sister of Jared Poe's lover. I am not saying she is not a bad writer, Mrs. Brite had me glued to the book til the very end. The crow itself seemed to have her own little personality of it's own and that's anthor part I liked."
3,Enjoyable- Brilliant in a twisted sense.,Brites combination of voodoo witchcraft and psychotic murder sets a vivid scene. The way she twisted the characters made the novel a definite must read. The characters personalities mesh with the dark background of New Orleans in a powerful scene of love and revenge!
4,"Dark, gory venegance - a bit too gory, in fact...","The Lazarus Heart is a really good, if somewhat short, novel set in the dark realms of The Crow. The characters, especially the twins, are as usual very distinct and interesting, just as the dialog between them. The story is also great, as you really get the feeling that the return to life for venegance is very justified. But, unfortunately, I think much of the eerie feeling always present when reading her work is ruined by the long and detailed descriptions of the numerous dissections. Not that they are all that scary, they just seem...out of place in her work. As finding a bit of a slimy kidney in a glass of dark, rich velvet-red wine, somehow. But it's definitly worth bying, though, as it is far better than ""Exuisite Corpse"". And the end's pretty good, too..."
4,NOT AT ALL BAD FOR A THEME SHE DIDN'T CREATE HERSELF.,"I thought that the whole crow idea, like in the movies, is pretty interesting. I'm also a huge fan of Poppy Z Brite. Together they create an interesting story. The only reasons I didn't give it a 10 was because, as another reader reviewed, she didn't really get into Jared Poe's head, or his character anymore than she did for the transsexual sister's character. Also, if she had gotten more into Jared, the book would've been longer, and I wish it was longer (I think there was something forgotten along the way...?) Anyway, I was surprised that there was no explicit sex in this story, ecspecially with how many homosexual characters there are. I did like how she did that 'story in a story' thing."
3,Not his best work,"It always amazes me how much this particular book of Hamilton photos goes for. When I finally got a copy I was not that impressed, compared to some of his other early works. Along with the usual pictures of young girls there are a lot of landscapes, which aren't bad but there are numerous other photographers who do a better job of landscape pictures. He has done rarer books in Japan which do command serious money and are worth it to the collector looking for pictures of a very particular nature."
5,a good durable strainer,"i wanted a pot strainer that would not go limp as some plastics do, so i chose the rsvp pot strainer for neatness and most of all its durability. it performs well, just like i thought it would. i definitely would buy this product again. for one thing, it fits most all pot rim sizes so thats a double-whammy for me. amazon is the only place i found it but there may be others, i just always go to amazon first. AND AMAZON DOESN'T LET ME DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Book Damaged,"Book came on time and for a good price, however upon receipt through the mail the book cover was folded over. This is a Christmas present, so not thrilled."
4,great bag for light travel,"Bought this sleeping bag for its light weight. Great for warmer weather hiking, camping. Also liked the expandable foot area, as mummy-style bags are too narrow for comfortable sleeping (for me - my feet have to have room..)."
1,Not a 40 degree bag,"I bought two of these for lightweight camping in MN this summer. Don't plan on being anywhere near comfortable down to 40 degrees. This is a 50 to 55 degree bag at best. It also seems shorter than most regulars I have been in, and I had problems with the zipper getting stuck/coming off every night. Mine is going back, used or not."
5,Love Heals How to Heal Everything With Love,"Dear Readers,This wonderful book by Shannon Peck is a must read for anyone interested in Love and the Spiritual World. Shannon shares her own experiences and growth as a healer in this remarkable book.Kudos to Shannon for the courage and honesty to take us into the world of Healing. In this book, we learn the actual techniques that can allow Love to heal us. This process takes us deep into the Spiritual World. It is a journey that highlights the healing procss that we can all use in our everyday lives. Everybody can learn from this book. Everybody can beneft from this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has experienced their inner voice. And for those who have not, this book just may take you there."
4,an exciting swashbuckler,"Considering that Smith was 14 when he wrote this, it is amazingly good. Although it doesn't have the atmosphere or otherworldly quality of his later work, it is full of vivid action and very well plotted. I found it hard to put down."
3,Significantly different color,"I purchased the khaki colored socks, but what I received was significantly darker than the image led me to believe. the label was correct, so this does not appear to be the fault of the seller. The ""3X"" is a little misleading too. The ""3X"" only appears on the one-liner, and does not show up on the product page. It does not mean that there are three pairs in each package--there is only one pair. Otherwise, this is a great sock!"
4,A GOOD PPV,THE PPV WAS GOOD THE BEST MATCH WAS THE STONE COLD MATCH AND THE ROCK VS KURT ANGLE THAT WAS GOOD TO YOU GOT TO GET NO MERCY 2000.
2,NOT VERY GOOD,DONT BUY THIS PPV....BETTER OFF GETTING NO MERCY 2001 OR NO MERCY 99..OR BETTER YET WRESTLEMANIA 17 OR ROYAL RUMBLE 2000.IT WAS PRETTY BORING WWF PPV...RECOMEND U HIRE THIS PPV BEFORE U BUY CAUSE U WILL BE UPSET...THE MATCH THAT STOOD OUT THE MOST WAS Y2J VS X-PAC.
2,worst ppv this year,"i was really expecting a great ppv out of no mercy but all i saw wasthe worst matches ever.i mean the most hyped match austin vs rikishiwas ridicilous.best match was hhh vs chris benoit.i also liked thetable invitational match pretty intresting.dont buy this video mayberent. some other videos i would recomend are wwf royal rumble2000,backlash 1999,king of the ring 1998,wrestlemania 14"
4,WWF/E No Mercy 2000,"It was great.The Best matches on NM2K were the Steve Austin-Rikishi streetfight,the HHH-Chris Beniot and The Rock-Kurt Angle match for the WWF/E Championship.The Worst Matches were The 6 person tag team match which didn't happened and the William Regal-Naked Mideon match.The Dudley Boyz invitational Tables match kind of remind me of the table matches of the old ECW days which made it a good and soild match.the rest are o.k.I give this event a 8 out of 10."
3,Pretty good PPV,This was a pretty damn good PPV.The match that stole the show for me was theAUSTIN/RIKISHI match. I really liked how they moved rikishi from were he was and now how he is. They did a good job pushing him to were he should be. The match could have bin better but over all it was greatThe other matches I didn't really care for except for the Rock/Angle match which was awesome too.I normaly review every match but for this I won't.I thought this and Unforgivin were two great ppvs for 2001...I think that was the year I saw them....Over all this was an average/good ppv...
3,Average dictionary,"Just like the advertisement: Computerized, like a computer print out. Lack of practical example use-in-a-sentence. Sometimes the translation can be very limited, offering not much help."
1,"Multitude, Hardt& Negri",I found this book so obscurely written that I did not bother to finish reading it.
1,Another dumb idea,"The argument here is simple and fantastic. The democracies in the world are not 'real' democracies, they are dictatorships of capital. But the world needs democracy. Of course it is the typical cirle. Everything you see is fake, but everything that you think you see should be real. The Communist Manifesto led directly to some 30 million deaths and the enslavement of 1.5 billion people, hopefully this manifesto will not wreak any havoc whatsoever, the world has tired of thse fake pseudo-intelletual 'we will solve the world's problems' ideas.The 'fake' democracy the authors of this book so abore is ironically the very one that allows them to write it and it is the capitalism this book hates so much that gives it a market.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,Good but not Pickle and Abrahamsson,"Steinhoff and Burgess's 6th edition is a goodbook but not inclusive compared with Pickleand Abrahammson. Also, there are some conceptsand points that seem to be inconsistent withspecific texts in other fields. For example,while there are 4 Ps in marketing, Steinhoffhas a fifth. There are lots of discussionquestions and good cases. However, the answersto some of the end-of-chapter review/discussionquestions can't be found in the text. Thesection on risk management does not get intothe four major ways of dealing with it, asper Boone and Kurtz, ""Contemporary Business.""Steinhoff and Burgess have a text that studentslike but it is too short and skimpy. Again,the cases don't have enough information andthe students have to make too many assumptionsin many instances. For an upper-level course,it isn't in the same ""league"" as Pickle. I am using Boone & Kurtz's ""Contemporary Business,"" '94-95 as a supplement."
5,perfect watch,I bought this for my husband over three years ago - and it still looks brand new! We got it on here for less than half of what they wanted to charge in a jewelry store. It is the best watch! And it should look brand new forever because of the tungsten.
1,Don't buy this bag!,"I hate this bag. I've used it on several trips with last night definately being the last time. The only feature that i like I about this bag is that it does compact pretty well and its light. It is definately not a 30F bag. Last night it got down to 27F and with 6 layers of clothes, fleece-lined socks, thermal underwear, and a warm beany I still froze. I lay awake shivering all night. I used this bag on a five day trip in yellowstone during June. It got down to the low 50's, high 40's at night and there were a few nights I was chilly then, but could solve it by layering.Warmth is not the only problem. The zipper on the side is a horrendous design. It'll have you cussing even if that's not your style. Bottom-line: you'll wish you'd spent the extra dollars and got something of more value."
4,hot!,this sleeping bag is surprisingly warm!! i was sailing down the nile river afraid of being eaten alive by the mosquitos so i had to stay bundled up and was sweating the entire night ... but the opening at the bottom comes in quite handy and the cinches around the head is a nice feature. and it folds up quite nicely (and small)!
1,Anchovies in Worcestershire Sauce?,"If you like the taste of anchovies, then you will like this worcestershire sauce. One of the ingredients is anchovies, and you can definitely taste them."
5,"Absolutely gorgeous lyrics, amazing vocals, great sound.","After hearing the song, Stranded, on the Drive Me Crazy soundtrack, I had to check out the rest of Plumb's songs and I absolutely fell in love. These songs touch you in ways that most artists now days can't do. The have a completely unique sound which is rare and special. I highly recommend anything else associated with this band."
5,Add to your collection,"Plumb has really impressed me! They have really tackled some deep issues and done a good job. Some songs seem to be a bit somber but with a strong message. Also, they have a good variety of sound, every song is different and beautiful. At the very least the words will make you think! The more you listen to the songs the more you'll be appreciate their unique style."
5,great,i love this cd im glad i found it the stores in town cant find it thanks keep up the good work when i got the cd it had no damage great shiping thanks
2,Lost the edge,"I think Plumb has lost its edge. They have gone the way of Jars of Clay by moving to the namby pamby. The first two songs are still very good but ""There's a God shaped hole?....cliche, cliche...middle of da road. Sorry I hope you come back. Why do you guys move from what got you fans in the first place to a totally different style? Get the edge back!"
1,"Very Sad, Songs have now Conviction to them.","I listened to a few cuts on Amazon and bought it. My loss. I wanted a Christian CD. Im not sure who they are singing about, could be a girl, guy or their dog. Lyrics are too hidden. Too sing songy and very slow moving album. The intro to every song is the best part, then it fizzels. There is too much good Christian music out there to waste your time on this one. I didnt like this one at all. This is one of thoses bands that want to make it in the mainstream but couldnt so they parked in the ""christian/gospel"" arena. Dont waste your money like I did."
3,Strange?,"I do not know that much about this band at all. But one of my favorite singers is Jennifer Paige. I thought I would see what these guys sounded like, but I thought it very strange that they have two exact songs that are on Jennifer Paige's ""Positively Somewhere"" album: ""Stranded,"" and ""Here With Me."" I thought that strange and I would of rather heard an album full of songs I hadn't already heard from other singers."
4,Great Pop CD,This CD has remained one of my favorite Pop CD's since it came out in 1999. Every song is catchy and Tiffany's voice is strong on every track. A must for any pop music fan!
4,AMAZING!!!,"Once in awhile you listen to a cd that really touches you, and ""candycoatedwaterdrops"" is one of those albums! I was first exposed to Plumb by the ""Brokedown Palace"" soundtrack, and I was impressed with ""Damaged"", the song featured on it. I was even more impressed with their entire album. The songwriting and arrangements on songs like ""drugstore jesus"" are unlike any I have ever heard. So whether you're a Christian music fan or just love inspiring music, you should pick up this album!"
4,"Great Cd, has everything, qualitymusic, lyrics, and God","Love this Cd...only downside is a couple of the songs are boring, great music and the lyrics are inspiring. Definitely a buy at that price. Jake"
4,Plumb's Lyrics continue,"Plumb's lyrics still have the beauty they did in their first self title album. One of my favorite things about an album are the poetic lyrics, and not so many bands have that. Plumb does. By nicely just sliding a view or meaning to a song, without saying it out straight, Tiffany's lyrics create about as close to poetry as one can get. Yet I only gave it four stars instead of five because I miss that ""Garbage""-style sound. But the songs Phobic and Damagaed make up for it."
4,How is this rock Christian?,"This is an excellent CD, but I don't understand the categorization as Christian rock? How is it any different from, say an early U2 album, which also was a rock album performed by professed Christians? Listening to it, I could hear some Christian subtext, but mainly it is a pop-rock album. Highlights: ""Stranded,"" ""Damaged,"" ""Lie Low,"" ""Drugstore jesus,"" and Tiffany's voice (the woman could sing the multiplication tables and make it sound good, at least up to the twelves). Don't be put off by the ""Christian"" label (if you are the type to be so, I mean). The music on this CD is just like what you'd hear on the radio, only better."
5,Tiffany Arbuckle strikes again!,"This cd is really worth buying! Just listen to the samples and you'll hunger for more. Tiffany makes yet, another great album! If you crave christian music with catchy tunes and great lyrics, this is the cd for you!"
5,Great,I bought this CD after hearing stranded on the drive me crazy soundtrack!! I had no idea whether i would like it or not but i liked that song so i thought why not!! I really really love the cd!! the songs are very beautiful!! the cd is definitely not what most people think of as christian music!! and i think it is basically pop!! It's a great cd!!
5,AprilLuckyStar,"It was a friend that gave me an audio record of Plumb, when I heard it at home I just couldn't believe...It was PERFECT!!! My friend (Claudia) always believed in God ,and she wanted me to be a litle more faithful. I think that ""Here with me"" had changed my life... Thank you ,Claudia for ""the gift"": an April Lucky star shinning out for me..."
5,"Cool godly Music, worth your money",Since I bought this CD I couldn't put it down. Because the music and the lyrics are so gripping and soul moving. I can cry out to God and find this album very helpful for my worship time. Listening to the words and the music I am moved deeply in my soul.
4,Cool funky stuff,"For a person like me used to folk-rock music this is a change. I dare say, this is almost disco!""In The Morning "" makes me feel like I'm in a dance club with lots of spinning lights and brightly colored drinks served in martini glasses.The songwriting is catchy though repetitious, but I guess that's what is appealing about this genre: you know what's coming so you know how to dance to it.Madelin Zero's voice is sexy kitten-ish and on ""Perfect Day To Lose"" you get to see how lovely it really is.""On Top Of My Building"" has a really funky old style sound. Reminds me of old Prince or Vanity 6.This is really fun electronica CD that will delight lovers of funky dance music."
1,THE POWER OF RIDICULOUSNESS,"""The Power of Sympathy"" was written to support the view of 18th century Americans, the early period after the Revolution, that the health of the American Republic depended on the moral virtue of women! The status of women is so different now, that when I realized the premise of the book I nearly rolled off the couch where I was reading it in laughter. In terms of late 18th century America, all contemporary American women are whores, and the Republic is damaged beyond repair. This might be true enough. I would not know how to rate the book and the political issues it raises as either pathetic or sublime! TRC"
4,It's sooo much better then a normal speaker,"I got the I-dog because I'd seen them when I went to Japan last year, and finally found them here in the states. I think they are adorable and my parents and friends agree that it makes a great speaker. But it's so much more fun then a normal speaker. And the purple chill outfit just makes it that much cuter."
5,Irresistable boogie and rockin' blues harmonica!,"One of the most amazing albums I have ever heard! Gritty, raw and full of original material by Dufresne. Saw him at the 2000 Winthrop Blues Festival and he played will zeal and passion seldom seen! Very nice man too, takes time for his fans and also a smooth dresser! Wore all black in the hot weather with a shaved head and goatee! Play him a lot at 1490 KOTY AM in The Yakima Nation Radio Station."
5,This pot is my pride and joy,"I had been ""lusting"" after a Le Creuset Dutch Oven for a couple of years, but couldn't justify the cost to myself. I love to cook, and my specialties are soups and stews. I finally decided I was worth it, and asked for it for Christmas last year. I love it! It gets lots of use, and was well worth the price. I sear meat in it, add my other soup/stew ingredients, and once brought to temperature, I turn the burner (gas) as low as it will go and just let it simmer happily for hours, with never a scorch or hot spot. It does not allow your soups/stews to cook away through steam, as the heavy tight-fitting lid retains the moisture and redeposits it back to the food. And it's so darn pretty! As Emeril would say, it makes me ""happy, happy, happy""."
5,BLUE BEAUTY cooks like a PRO!!!,"This is one amazing 'pot'. It can sear a roast before putting into the oven (the lid and handles can take the heat up to 450degrees), but it can sear, cook and clean up like a breeze! We have always seen these wonderful LeCruset pans on ALL the cooking shows we love, and never thought we would be able to AFFORD one!! They are everything anyone has ever said positive about them...they perform remarkably, and clean up just like they promise ---like a breeze! No wonder so many famous cooks on TV use them at their work, on TV, and especially at home!! Thanks AMAZON.COM for giving us the chance to cook like a pro!!! KUDO'S! :)"
2,OK Product,"The product appears to be of nice quality, big I am not overlly impressed or particularly happy about the price of this thing."
2,size of product,"The Bible is fine, however the size of the bible was not made clear. It is very small with small print.I will be more carefull in the future"
5,A great way to read the entire Bible,"I had a hardcopy of this book and did read the entire Bible in one year. I lent it to someone and never got it back so I purchased the Kindle version.The navigation in the Kindle is so much easier to use than the paper copy. If I want to go to a particular book in the Bible (instead of reading in the day order), there are hotlinks to all the books in the Bible listed on several pages. There are two lists of all the books in the Bible -- one in sequential order or the other in alphabetical order.Each month has a list of the days with hotlinks to that day. The four readings for the day (one from the Old Testament, one from the New Testament, one from Psalm, and one from Proverbs) are listed at the start of the day and are also hotlinks to each reading.The sequence is better than just starting at Genesis in January and ending at Revelations in December. The mixture of Old, New Psalm, and Proverbs keeps the reading balanced."
5,Great S,I received the book as stated and it was received in a very timely matter. I amd Very Satisfied with this Dealer!!!
5,Excellent,I am currently reading it nightly to my 12 and 13 year olds and it is wonderfully written and in an English they can understand.Extremely well done.
5,Great Starter Bible,"I have spent most of my adult life wanting to read the Bible but never being able to stay focused much beyond ""Let there by light."" I just would get confused and lost and then would give up. This One Year Bible is amazing. The NLT makes it easy to read and understand, it flows like any other book or story would. I read other reviews before ordering and knew not to flip to the actual date to start reading. I received the Bible mid-Feb and made the decision to ""catch up"", I started by reading just the Old Testament (from Jan 1 forward) until I reached the day I was on, then I went back and started reading the New Testament as well. It took me about a week and a half to catch up so that I could read each day's entire reading on the day to day basis. The daily readings are easy to work into your daily routine and you'll find yourself really looking forward to sitting down with this book each day."
2,The One Year Bible,"I was very disappointed that the bible that was sent to me looked nothing like the one I had ordered. The bible is very small, the cover is leather, and very small print. I had order one before and it was exactly what I ordered. I don't understand why someone would advertise one book and send a completely different one."
2,Not in standard bible version,"This may actually be a very good book to use, but before you buy please know that it is not in a standard bible version. Meaning that it can not be used as a regular bible because it does not follow the books in sequence. It it broken up in sections strictly for daily reading. For example, if you want to locate a book, chapter and verse, you cannot find it by following the sequence of the books and if the search is used, it takes quite a bit of time to download. I am not saying that this is a bad book, it's just a bad version if you are looking for a standard bible. Take note from the introduction of the book that roughly states that if you want to use the book as a standard bible, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE."
1,Great concept HORRIBLE translation!,"I love the Bible in a Year concept. I purchased this translation a few years ago and started in immediately. I am a graduate of a Christian college and so I have read, studied and know the Bible pretty well. My Study Bible has several reading options but require me to go back and forth between books and I thought this one would be easier because it has everything separated by dates. It didn't take long into my first reading to realize something was wrong, nothing seemed to be making sense. I grabbed my Study-Bible and realized the translation is HORRIBLE!!! I have since purchased the NIV version of this same Bible and am MUCH happier!! Unfortunately, you can't buy the NIV version for the Kindle... I'm still looking for a good Kindle translation..."
5,I love it!,"I really like the NTL version, nothing against the other translations, but this one is so much easier for me to read. I grew up on the KJV, which I still go to for finding verses, but for daily reading I really like this one. In fact, I liked it so much - I purchased another one for a Christmas present for a friend. (he was excited when he opened his gift and saw his One Year Bible)."
5,Great translation!,"I wanted to read the Bible in a year, but I also wanted to understand it better. I will admit there are parts that are still unclear, but this translation helped in many ways. If you are looking for a study bible, this will not fulfill your needs. However, if you are looking for an easy-to-read translation that is broken into manageable chunks, I would recommend this one!"
5,Makes for an enlightening year,"I like the way this Bible study is organized. Each day's reading includes a passage from the Old Testament, New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs, which gives perspective and insight. The New Living Translation is written in contemporary English using familiar words and phrases. At first this seemed strange to me, but it is helpful for study.I thought that reading the Bible in one year would be a big challenge, but it has turned out to be a rewarding undertaking. The opposite of a burden, it's been a help. I recommend this study program."
3,Kindle edition,I like this format of chronological reading. It helps place some the biblical history timeline. Good format for daily reading.My only complaint is the formating that is lacking in the Kindle Edition. Needs chapter marks and better refeerence/links throughout the book.
4,The One Year Bible,"1 Year Bible LT - Good translation and goes thru the Bible well, easy to read and keeps you up to day."
5,Awesome Book,"This is probably one of the best Bible readings in one year that I've ever used. Having it on the Kindle Fire makes it even more pleasurable as you can bookmark pages, create highlighted verses for memorization. Excellent buy!!"
5,Great navigation and options,"I love the One-Year Bible anyway, and having it on my Kindle keeps it with me so that I can read in small chunks during the day when I get an unexpected break. This version is one of the best to navigate of any of my Kindle books, and gives some great options such as type/size/color of text"
4,One Year Bible,"I use this everyday since Jan. 1, 2012 and appreciate the format. Nice to have Old Testament, New, Psalms and Proverbs ready for each day."
4,very good way of reading something we should all read in a year,very well done. makes it a fun and easy way of reading the bible which we all should do at least 1 a year
5,Bought FOUR and counting...,"I received this book as a gift for Christmas from one of my friends. I was always discouraged to read the Bible because the few times I attempted I couldn't understand it and I became frustrated and unfocused. Words cannot describe how much wisdom and strength the, New Living Edition, has provided me. This edition provides understandable language and lessons the amount of translations and research involved. Since then I shared my experiencing with friends who also became interested in giving it a try. I found the NLT Bible is a wonderful gift and gesture to help God spread His Word. :)"
2,Bad binding,"The binding was inferior, pages too thin, font too tiny (i have other models of this compact version that are a whole lot better). The product itself is nice. The daily reading arrangement is very useful for Christians desiring to know the bible, as opposed to stumbling on portions from time to time. I recommend the one that comes in blue if you need a compact hard cover daily bible."
2,Where's the Story?,"This book was really nothing more than 417 pages of filler...and only then if you read the previous Sally Harrington books.Sally testifies at a trial and then sits in and reports on it. She begins a flirtation with a young cop. OK, where's the story? That's all there is to it, and it left me feeling like I wasted my time reading something that could've been compressed into a few pages tacked onto the ending of the previous installment.Hopefully the next one is better."
2,nothing new here,"this book was a big disappointment. First -- there was no real plot, unless a New Guy is supposed to qualify. the whole book is about the trial that follows the last book. Nothing new or surprising happens at the trial. this is the biggest flaw -- the whole book is just an epilogueSecond: things that should be Startling Developments are a letdown. Much is made of the fact that the wife of the killer of Sally's father has a dying wish to see her, but when we find out why, the why leads nowhere. it's a big ""so??"" This is just one example.Third: you don't have to be a trial lawyer to find the courtroom stuff annoying -- you learn this much just from watching Law & Order -- which is, that all that defamatory stuff about Sally could have been objected to by the defense. So I found it annoying.I came away with the impression that van Wormer's books are heading more and more away from mystery/suspense and closer to superficial romances."
2,Beware,"I have owned this microwave for 11 months. The exhaust fan is very load and not very efficient, We tried vented and non vented, neither work very well. Have had the fan repaired 2 times. The door hand broke and had to have that repaired.Now the fan for the convection oven needs to be replaced.It also gets so hot its melting the interior plastic parts.We bought an extended warrantee [where America shops] with a lemon clause but they are refusing to replace it ! Extremely overpriced and would not recommend."
5,I cook for a living...,"We use this one at work. It's a wonderfull, verstatile piece for medium size jobs such as braising, stewing, sweating, roasting, etc. This piece does it all!Le Creuset quality craftsmanship is the standard in cast iron cookware.I want one at home...in granite...please?We be givin' dis biggie 5 mojo*z!!!"
2,construction is not high quality,this hat just dosen't seem to be made very well. the sewing is sketchy and it dosen't look right in some places. i won't be wearing the hat. i guess this time i got what i paid for.
5,Comfy Cap,"Fits well and holds its shape. Comfy. This cap has the low profile, roundish appearance that I prefer. I recommend this cap."
2,Misleading,"Upon receiving this item, I discovered that it is not, as written on the cover, ""La Divina Commedia"" in its totality, but in fact, is just the ""Inferno"" portion. That's 1/3 of poem. Putting ""La Divina Commedia"" on the cover is vastly misleading and I wish that I had instead gotten the Bantam Classics dual language version."
4,Buckethead is strangely entertaining,"Besides the difficult menus, once you navigate them there are good pieces of the dvd. Be patient is all I can say"
5,fast shipping,"fast and courteous,item as described,this is for the buckethead fan,great stuff on this dvd, the menus are cool to mess around with as well"
5,A little crazy but genius!,"A fan of the guitar? Then check out Buckethead. This DVD will keep you busy for hours. His music ranges from ""put you to sleep"" to ""make you go insane"". I'm not kidding, he's amazing!"
3,Bucket half full or half empty ?,"Well, I have only been into Buckethead for a few months after I saw him on Claypool's video. This dvd set is less than expected for me. I wanted to see him in concert with a real drummer and bass player but didnt get that. One review mentioned 2 full concerts on one cd but I never found it. Anyway, it was kind of fun to watch the goofy stuff but sure wanted to see more concert footage. After playing with this dvd for a while, I did find the second concert and didn't like it very much."
4,INTERESTING & SUSPENSEFUL,"This book was very interesting. It showed us how if you dream it , you can be it. Although we all have lost people that we love if you believe in them hard & long enough they will always be with us & never leave our side. T his book actually made me feel the characters pain. Being black is not easy, even in today's ""liberated & non-racial world"". It showed how you don't have to be guilty of actually commiting a crime, just being around the scene & being black is enough to convict a person. I t also showed how black men believed in their own. None of the male characters in the book had to stand fight & die for the younger black male, but they chose to because they were tired of being reguarded as nothing but ""niggers"" that needed to be kept in their place. Hopefully some day the senseless accusations & convictions of innocent black men & women everywhere will end."
2,Television movie of the week in print,"I am an African-American. Generations of my family were raised in the area which was the setting of Magic City. Many times I heard stories of the Tulsa Riots of 1921. Never was the incident so trivalized as in this book. Perhaps it is the times which we live that media tends to take major events in life and package them for public consumption. But in doing so we lose the lesson to be learn. Magic City failed to convey anything meaningful about Tulsa Riots and the estimated 3000 African-Americans that lost thier lives at the hands of not some militia extremist, but our government's National Guard. If you are looking for a television movie of the week in print version of the Tulsa Riots, then purchase this book. It is soda pop writing at it best"
3,There are better,"Reading an ad for Mothers new line, this product being one, I decided to give it a try. They claim it leaves a deep long lasting satin finish - perfect, I dont want my tires to look like shiny plastic. It does leave a no shine finish, but it doesn't really give the standout deep black ""satin"" finish I had hoped. Furthermore some of the products that I have been happy with lasted 2-4 times as long, this fading noticably between weekly bathing."
3,A Day At The Beach,"...this rare VHS is the first Barney tape ever made! The Barney in this video is way different to the one we have now. Dark purple,looks silly, and friendly. Take a look at the first of Barney."
4,barney,I am a preschool teacher and this Barney episode always captivates the imagination of my 3 year olds.
5,Great gift to give/receive.,"I bought 5 of these sleep shirts to give as gifts to family members. The shirt is adorable, seems to be good quality cotton and well made (like the good ol' days). I gave my shirt as I needed an extra gift for a niece, so now I need to order another. They are reasonably priced and worth the money."
2,i don't love it...,"For this price, I'd prefer the wooden puzzle (e.g. Melissa & Doug). Admittedly for cardboard, it's studier than a supermarket $5 puzzle. The puzzle pattern is printed identically under the pieces (same gloss/cardboard, even with puzzle piece outlines). I guess it makes it easier for some kids, but I find it a bit annoying since it makes it a little tough to see which pieces are already in and which are not. I can tell my daughter likes it, but doesn't love it. She won't sit through and do it all at one-go like she does with other puzzles."
3,I wish it is not from paper!,"I got another Learning Journey Jigsaw puzzle from local store made of wood. It was nicely made and looks sturdy. Hence I searched on Amazon for similar kinds and found several like this one.To my disappointment, the material is from thick paper instead of wood board, which lacks the feeling ... of wood.I have to admit for jigsaw puzzle having targeted picture on the board may not be a good way to educate children to learn how to put back. They just follow the picture.Even so, the colorful picture makes one lost very easily. I'd not recommend this one."
5,Fantastic,"My wife loves this thing. It is great looking, and great quality. It seems like it should last a lifetime."
2,Bait and switch??,"It's a great utensil so far as I expected. However, unlike the picture, my cobalt blue french oven came with a large white rectangle on the side emblazoned with Le Creuset. Yuck. It's conspicuous and ugly. I wouldn't have bought it had I known, but I've decided to keep it since the pot itself seems great."
1,The pot is not high quality like I thought it was,"I bought a Le Creuset stockpot for my wife. She used it a few times to cook rice, then noticed a big hole in the enamel in the bottom of the pot. The pot is not high quality like I thought it was."
5,the reviews were right,"I found it very interesting that everyone was raving so much over a pot. But they were right. Le Cruset makes a great ""french"" oven. I have used mine several times and each time it has heated evenly and works for both a roaring boil and a light simmer. The extreme weight is a testament to the quality (but it doesn't make for easy removal of leftovers from the fridge). It looks so nice that, when not being used to store those leftovers, I keep it right on the stovetop. I'm sold on Le Cruset."
5,Absolutely worth the money - exceeded my expectations,"Like most people reading these reviews, I did my research and wondered whether I would regret spending so much money on a single item of cookware. Well, let me assure you, it's money well spent. I just cooked my first-ever perfect pot roast (I have been pot-roast challenged for years), and though I had a great new recipe this pot gets most of the credit for turning out a deliciously tender, juicy roast. I was also amazed at how beautifully it cleaned up. After going from stovetop to oven and back to the stovetop, I thought surely I would have to soak the pan but nothing stuck at all. All it needed was a quick hand washing and it looked just like new. Now I want a whole kitchen full of Le Creuset!"
5,Gift,"This was an anniversary gift. The giftees are very happy with the it. I does a great job of cooking large meals both on top of the stove or in the oven, just be aware that these dutch ovens are very heavy."
2,Expensive and hard to clean,"I have the 7-1/4 Quart and have been using it for months. I cook a lot, I mean everyday so it gets a work-out. I find that food sticks and burns to the bottom (maybe I have a bad cooktop, I don't always use high heat, if that's what you are thinking.) Also, it is hard to clean, I have burned spots on the bottom (yes, I use non abrasive cleaners....) I really wanted this brand because of all the hype but I find it really is not worth the very and I mean very high price. (did I mention it is HEAVY to lift??)On the positive side it is very beautiful on my cooktop, which is where I leave it for all to see. (it won't fit in any cabinet)"
3,Too much money to be disappointed,"I am disappointed in the Le Creuset round 7 1/4 qt french oven. It spewed water from under the lid the entire time while cooking a chicken stew and the pot was only little over half full. I certainly expected more from such an expensive item."" I should not have to constantly wipe water from a dripping lid on a pot that cost this much. I had to stay close by the entire time because of this. The pot is sturdy, easy to clean and looks good but this problem took all the fun out of using it. This is my first piece of Le Creuset cookware and it may well be my last."
4,"Great item, but no pot is worth this much money!","If this hadn't been on sale for under $100, I wouldn't have gotten it. It's great, though! Looks good on the table, excellent heat retention (if I keep the lid on and let it set in a warm kitchen, it'll keep soup warm all day), and I like the size and heft. I'd have given it 5 stars if it weren't so exorbitantly expensive. I'm sure there are good Dutch ovens out there for less."
3,Item was damaged during shipment,"The item was damaged during shipment. It was very poorly packed and so I am not surprised that it was damaged. The return process was easy and the refund was prompt. I am, however, very disappointed in the manner in which it was shipped by Amazon (not by a third party). I ended up purchasing another product (not Le Creuset)locally of equal or better quality for less than half the price."
5,Best possible cookware,"I have discovered that enameled cast iron is absolutely the best material for all kinds of cooking: sautéing, braising, baking, making soups, roasting, and just about anything else. The possible downside is that they can not be cleaned in the dishwasher, but this is of no significance because 1) they are so big they take up too much space or simply don't fit in a residential dishwasher, and 2) clean up is very easy since nothing sticks. (The rims are not enameled and would rust in the dishwasher). If you know someone who likes to cook and doesn't own one of these, then buy them one. They'll definitely appreciate it!"
5,Worth your money!,"Love this product. I have a set of LeCreuset pots and pan. Bought this to replace my 5qt one, which I burn the hell out of food onto the enamel (Pot itself is still fine)."
3,Nice but costly to maintain,"Great product but cracked during second use. Mail in warranty service worked and product was replaced at no charge. Problem is it cost $26 to ship to warranty center and this was on us. If it happens again, we'll probably just scrap it."
2,Top doesn't lay flat,"We just purchased our first Le Creuset dutch oven and having paid close to $300 for it, we were very disappointed to find that the top of the unit is visibly skewed so that it doesn't lay flat either on a flat counter or on the pot, and therefore rocks considerably. When it sits on the pot, some points along the top are 3/16"" above the top of the base, while other points along the top fit tighly against the top of the base. We will be returning this unit in the hopes that the next one we receive will not be skewed."
5,Must have piece of cooking equipment,"I absolutely LOVE this cookware. Don't be put off by the seemingly high price. You will hand this stuff down to your kids. What's so special about it? It out performs all of my other cookware (yes, even All-Clad) on the stovetop and in the oven. The even heating is better than I could have imagined. It will even perform despite the crappiest cooktops. And, as an added bonus, it's the easiest to clean. I use mine for most everything . . . pot roast, soup, stew, pasta sauces, braising, slow-cooking, etc. It's great!"
5,Le Creuset 9Qt. French Oven,"This is without a doubt a five star Cooking pot. My wife and I purchased our pot after comparing it with other smaller sized and priced enameled castware available. We found this pot had thinner side walls that reduced the wt. of this larger 9QT. French oven. The lid is heavy and fits well for a better seal. The over all fit and finish are what you would expect on a pot in this price catagory. The price is high but we believe worth the extra cost in performance, size to weight ratio, quality casting and enamel coating(we have cobalt blue). To smaller and older cooks the overall weight was a consideration for us as well. We are pleased that this size was manageable and not too heavy when lifting the filled pot without the lid."
5,I enjoy this soundtrack tremendously,"Unfortunately, this soundtrack did not have all the songs on it that I loved from the movie, but it still is a really good compilation of songs and is very fun to listen to any time of the day. This is by far my favorite CD that I own. The Tokyo Drift theme song by Teryaki Boyz is just a rockin' song; it is really fun and great for testing out sound equipment. Five stars for that song alone! If a second soundtrack was to be released, I would most certainly purchase it."
4,If you liked the movie...,"...you'll definitely like the soundtrack. A few songs that were in the movie got left out as you can tell by previous reviews which is why it gets a 4.What is the name of the song that is playing when the credits start to roll? It's a techno song and the lyrics I can hear are, ""I rock, irock, irock, iroll..iroll..iroll, i rock i roll"
4,Question,"I don't really even remember the movie that well, but there is a scene (I guess there are alot of scenes) where Han and Sean are driving together. I think this was either right before or right after they went to Han's garage. Either way, they're on the road together and it's a hip hop song (in English). It's not the whistle song. and i know this is a really vague explanation but if anyone knows what I'm talking about, could you please let me know what the song is?? Thanks."
3,F&F3 Tokyo Drift song 9 isnt,"I bought this for a number of songs. I like the Julez Santana song ""There it go"" The whistle song. Well, According to the Amazon listing Track 9 should be that song, but on the CD its Atari Teenage Riot ""Speed"". Santana's song is nowhere on the CD. I hope Amazon can get this error fixed soon. I just wonder how many other CD's are like that. Other than that good CD."
3,"*** if you've seen the movie, but some songs missing","I wouldn't have bought this without having had the sentimental attachment that goes with associating the songs with scenes from the movie [which isn't exactly Gone With The Wind, but the acting is great (albeit hokey at times); the action non-stop, the stunts amazing and the big ""message"" (aside from achieving it via mass casualties) is good.].Unfortunately, like the other reviewers, I'm bummed that some of my favorite songs weren't included in the soundtrack. Which brings me to the real reason for posting here: Does anyone know the name of the song that is playing when Shawn arrives in Tokyo?"
4,Good Movie GREAT soundtrack,"I liked the movie.....but for me It was my first introduction to Japan rap which I LOVED. The soundtrack is worth buying!! Can anyone tell me the name of the band who sang ""Hey Moma you sexy""? It was in the club scene where dozens of hot chicks were dancing. Thanks!!!"
5,WoW,"Yeah Baby .. this soundtrack is Perfect ... Metal, Rap, HipHop, Regaetton and J-pop .. it brings out those certain special moments in the movie where you can't help but hold your breath with the amazing dispaly of speed !!!... Sure, the movie had no story, but those racing scenes were good .. and the music is even better!!..Featuring Mos Def, Evil Nine, Don Omar, Julez Santana, Dragon Ash, and 5,6,7,8's"
1,Not very good...,"The only good song, in my opinion, is that Barracuda. Partly because it shares it's title with the fastest production car in history."
3,Decent...,"This soundtrack is pretty good except for one flaw that many other soundtracks tend to have, as well. They put tracks on the CD that you really don't hear too much in the movie, and the cool songs that you like and hear in the movie aren't on the soundtrack. Like what was the deal with the Spanish songs? The movie takes place in TOKYO! That's Japan for anybody who is geographically challenged. Why is Spanish music in an American/Japanese soundtrack? I would much rather have replaced those songs by Kid Rock or the Whisper Song that you hear in the movie, but they just so happened to leave them out."
3,The bag already broke,"The stuff sack on this sleeping bag had a draw string inside the top ring to seal the bag shut, but it broke the first time I tried to use it. Uggggh. Other than that, it's light and small. It's been good for good weather bike touring in a tent."
2,Nowhere Near Complete -- Even For Beginners,"Let's start with the cover of the book. ""Basic and advanced techniques"" it says. Really? Crossing one skate over the other and jumping in place are about as advanced as this book gets.For the complete beginner, this can be a handy book. If you've never set foot on skates, or can't figure out how to stop, this book can help. If you'd like to read a brief history of in-line skating, this book can help. If you're interested in skating purely for physical fitness, this book can help.If, on the other hand, you're interested in learning more than how to stop, go, turn and skate backwards (though I find this instructions for skating backwards to be lacking) then keep looking, you won't find any ""advanced"" information here.All in all, this book touches lightly on a variety of beginner's topics, but fails to keep its promises, especially to those looking to get more in-depth."
4,I liked it.,"This was a good book for me. I am not the most green conscious person, but I feel I should be. I mistrust environmentalists because a lot of them got some funky spiritual ideas. Probably what this book does best is defend Christianity against the charge that it is to blame for our coming enviormental crisis. McGrath without excusing Christians, does not scapegoat Christianity as being a philisophical underpinning which enables Western people to rape nature. No he has other ideas about where we get those Ideas. But I wouldn't want to spoil it."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for Reenchantment of Nature. I was seeking a good text that would strongly link environmentalism and Christianity. Unfortunately, this text disappoints. It reads like a dry, haphazard, graduate school lecture (and I have a masters degree). After reading the text, I had to go back and re-read the introduction to see what McGrath cited as the point of the book. The real premise for the book appears to be an academic paradigm war between McGrath and Richard Dawkins. As with most academic wars, those seeking knowledge are left wanting as the ""experts"" pontificate in elusive terms.I wish I could recommend this text more highly. The topic area does need some good discussion. However, this text is simply not accessible to the average person."
2,Book is about relationship with soldier's families,"I didn't like this book. It was more about the soldier's relationships with their families than about what they did during the war. There was one good story, the helicopter crash, that showed what medics do."
3,Not what I expected,"This was overall a good read, however, it was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for more stories about the patient care aspect of a Combat Medics job.It did give me an idea of the role of the combat medic and how it differs from the role of the US Navy Hospital Corpsman.I would have liked more patient care stores and more informaiton about the training rquired to become a medic and the training recieved prior to going to the ""sandbox"""
1,Do your own research,"The copyright on this book is 2002, but many entries have proven to be outdated or plainly incorrect. I purchased this book with the intent of adding to the companies I was already writing for. I sent out a little more than 3 dozen requests for guidelines and have so far received 6 Return to Senders for bad or outdated addresses. At least three companies have responded stating that they DO NOT WORK WITH FREELANCERS. This, with only about a 2/3 response so far.There was also a bad address that I caught before mailing out the requests. Purchasing this book was a waste, further exacerbated by the postage blown on mailings to useless addresses. I suspect there is a reason the book was self-published.If you're going to spend the money anyway, put it toward a copy of Writer's Market or Greetings magazine. Don't throw it away on this book."
2,Not for anyone needing to do statistical analysis,"Nicely presented for the basic intro into statistics; mean, mode, probability, rates, basic graphs and charts, what a standard deviation is, what is correlation and regression ,etc. However, nothing on what statistical tests to perform when you have data to analyse, such as a student-t test, Chi Square, Mann-Whitney Test, or power analysis.I bought this book thinking it would nicely outline statistical tests one would use and explain when to use the proper test. It doesn't mention any statistical analysis.A very good book to review what would probably be in chapter 1 of any stats book plus correlation and regression. These are important concepts which need to be understood before one could think with statistics but certainly not ""The Only Statistics Book You'd Ever Need."""
3,Watch out for math errors,"As an adult long past math class, I am attempting to home school myself on statistics. This book has been reasonably simple to understand, but I am finding random math errors that make the learning process FAR more difficult. Particularly in the 6th chapter on percentiles, I have encountered three errors - looks like a poor editorial review job. The subject is difficult enough, without having to figure out the author or publisher has made mistakes. If anyone knows how I can reach Mr. Slavin by email, I'd appreciate you posting a review here. Thank you."
5,gotta love Tiger,"I bought all three of the 'Novels of Tiger and Del' at the same time. Tiger is a wonderful narrator, even in the second book which is not my favorite. Easily one of the most enjoyable series I've read in the last few years. The writing is intelligent and the characters enjoyable."
5,Rosemary Thornton's 'The House that Sears Built',"If I wasn't interested in Sears homes before, I definitely am now! This illustrated book makes me want to scour the city to see if there are any of these homes here in Texas! The book is very well written....in a manner that the lay person can understand. Her knowledge and passion for Sears homes is most evident in her writing. I've had the pleasure of communicating with Ms. Thornton, and she is delightful and most willing to share her wealth of information."
2,The Houses That Sears Built,"This book is basically a collection of photocopies and not very professionally done. The author could have spent more time making better maps and providing more research for the cost of this book. One gets tired of seeing ""smiley faces"" in a research book. The author provides her e-mail address which would have made the difference to this purchaser, but she does not answer inquiries. Therefore, I cannot give a very good rating. The author assumes responsibility when publishing contact information for those who have purchased her book. Disappointed."
3,Blur printing,"The quality of print is somewhat low. It looks like all pages are printed by inkjet printer. Cover page is somewhat blur. The text is not sharpyly printed. I don't think this is acceptable for a $80 textbook. Anyway, it's a good query processing textbook."
1,Cheezy,Flimsey and not well made. I will be surprised if this survives a few uses. Wheel and handle are plastic.
4,Can't read it just once,LOVED IT!! I've been reading it over and over. Joey is a spunky angel but I felt a certain SOMEONE needs to own up to what s/he did!!
2,"Good, But Wait For A Firmware Upgrade.","This is a very good product for watching all your tv shows and movies on a tv, but sadly, the 320x240 resolution supported by the zune is too low for good quality video on an average sized tv(35+ inches). It will look all choppy and blocky, wait for the future when microsofts new firmware will support higher resolution videos so you will be able to watch it on a tv."
2,Dragon Lover,"Ordered this ring as a gift after reading the other reviews. Received the ring very quickly, and when I opened it - I thought it can't be the same ring. VERY disappointed with the details. I couldn't tell what the dragon was. I regret buying it."
5,Mine works fine,"This scale not only looks great, it works fine. It was fairly easy to figure out how to switch it to pounds. You have to wait a few seconds for it to decide your weight, but then it seems very consistant (and flashes the final bad news). It does weigh about 5 lbs heavier than my previous scale, but when compared to a sliding weight scale, seems very accurate. I like the large, clear digital numbers also."
2,It is not what I expected!,"1. It lacks in quality,2. Shows different values in a few minutes time,3. There is no info tag (where made in) on any side of the item."
1,Is it really supposed to fly?,"Following the directions to a ""T"" we tried three times to fly this plane, it never got off the ground and in using the launch cord set with it, the plane came apart all three times the third resulting in the wires being torn from engines. Very poorly designed and I have serious doubts this plane was ever meant to fly, at least not following the directions the plane came with. I did find this toy highly educational, as I will spend my money more wisely next time!"
5,Lake Tahoe,Excellent book. Was unable to find anywhere else but tremendous history of Lake Tahoe. Worth the money.
4,Diverse and Thoughtful,"If you think academia has abolished the idea of a God who is intimately involved in our lives, check out this jewel. This is a collection of essays written by scholars who have attended, taught at, or spoken at Harvard. The compilation weaves in and out of lives in areas such as the sciences, education, politics and family. Not only is it well written and thoughtful, but (on a more personal side) it contains a warmth and purpose that I struggled to find in my higher education years."
2,Entertaining but not too helpful.,The book has a lot of text and a lot of humor. It's entertaining to read but I didn't find it very helpful for report writing. When you look at the highlighted portions of the text you have to do extensive reading to find out if you are doing it the right way or the wrong way. It felt more like an episode of the world's worst police reports. The book could have been organized better with major points highlighted. The commonly confused word section was very helpful.
4,Very informative,"This book has a lot of the fundamentals for selecting, purchasing and prepping several varieties of seafood. The one thing that could have been better is to have pictures of the prepared dishes associated with the recipies."
5,Good recipes & great information,"Bought this for my brother because he's started spear fishing off the coast in southern California, but he's going to get tired of making fish tacos really fast. The book was in good condition for being used, and I really enjoyed reading the history and the background on a lot of the commercial fishing that's happening on the West Coast. Recipes run the gamut from simple to complex and feature some really nice ingredients and recipes."
1,Not into Low Income Housing? Then Forget It!,"Unless you are interested in the ins and outs of low income rental housing this book is NOT for you. The more I read the more dissapointed I became. For example, he notes that many of his tenants won't have telephones.As a first time investor in rental property, I was looking for a good all-around reference. I later found the book Landlording by Leigh Robinson which is an excellent and practical reference."
3,Good book but not great. Good for low income property owners,"While this book was useful to read, it certainly could have been better. The author refers to all his experiences which are helpful, the problem is these took place in the 90's in Ohio where he purchased duplexes(2 units side by side) for $20,000. All his example's are based on purchasing properties for between $10,000 and $30,000. I don't know how many people can relate to that, I just know that I can't seeing that 3 families that I purchase here in Boston start around $450,000. Also, I would only recommend this book to those people who purchase properties in low-income neighborhoods. Don't get me wrong, some the information regarding tenant selection, eviction and other things are useful, but overall this book is not great and is not for everyone. I bought the book used for $2.50 so it was definately worth it for me and it's an easy read."
1,way out of date and assumes cash for all properties,"This book was written in 1994. ""Look for certain properties by real estate agents that are not listed by MLS.' That one line will tell you that this book is loaded with facades and incorrect advice. Try another book and make sure that Amazon lists the date of publish (1994 for this book) not the reprint date (2002 for this book.)"
1,Does not come with the Micro size,Ordered because I lost my Micro charger tip. This set does not come with the Micro Charger tip. So this purchase was a complete waste of money. Probably not the sellers fault but still stinks.
2,No Hands Han,"Unfortunately, this figure wasn't durable for me, the right hand went missing, quickly. Didn't order from this vendor, store bought, but same figure. Good for collectible, not for actual child play, like other SW Figs."
5,Black Heritage,"This book was extremely enlightening and great reading. It captures the history of Black culture from the beginning of the slave trade to America and the significant contributions made by Blacks.I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading, regardles of race, ethinic background, religion, or cultural beliefs."
4,A must read for those interested in the influence of african americans abroad and in the u.s.,"This book is a good reference for those who want to gain more knowledge about the african american experience before slavery and after. There is so much more to African American history than being enslaved in the United States. In this book you learn a little about African civilization, slavery, post slavery and today."
4,Easy read,"This book provides a good overview of the material that will be covered on the exam. Although the information is presented in a format to fit the objectives, the scenarios and test questions at the end of each chapter did a good job of covering the test. I do not think someone preparing to write this exam will be disappointed with this text."
1,Written in a hurry,"Apparently this book was intended to be the _first_ study guide for the 70-225 exam. It was written in the dark; before the Microsoft Official Curriculum and in its greater part is a collection of free style essays intended to meet the corresponding Exam Objectives. They have missed. I recently took the exam and it is quite far away from the contents of this book. If you are looking for a good Exchange 2000 book full with real life experience, go for Tony Redmond's book. It is certainly harder to swallow but is worth it."
1,Don't be fooled,"this listing states it's for a house, but you will recieve the horse pictured instead (which is only about 4 inches big). I ended up with a Free horse out of this bad deal....."
5,Dazed & Confused: On Point,"Dazed and Confused offers a real, true-to-life account of young adult life and the transtion from college life to the ""real world"". Easy to read, hilariously funny, and a down-to-earth tone make Dazed and confused a definite addition to your must read list."
4,KEEP IT REAL OR YOU WILL ALSO BECOME DAZED AND CONFUSED!,"Dazed and Confused... Hilarious book Troy martin said more than enough about surviving the life in the game. When reading this book I cried and I laughed. I have alot of friends that were in college and were in similar situations like the chracters in this book. if you are all about keeping it real you, you should pick up a copy of Dazed and Confused it's a quick read and you will definitely have some laughs. The chracter in the book Tony he is the one that the story really speaks about him and his girlfriend Monica are going through the relationship thing you have to read the book and find out exactly what happened the book was just that good that I can't put it in the right words with out spoiling the story line for you. So if you have not read Dazed and Confused do so I highly recommend this book. Mr. Martin I'm waiting for the 2nd part because I know there have to be a sequel!"
1,Not Amused,"Although I see the point of his book, it lends nothing to the avid reader. There was too much narration and not enough dialogue. The book was very slow in the beginning and it took a long time to develop the plot. My book club was not pleased at all with the book. Only two of our members actually read the book! In the future, I hope Mr. Martin produces a work of art that gives the reader an avid imagination of the plot and characters."
1,Dazed and Confused After Reading This Drivel,"First of all let me say that I usually do not write reviews... At times I felt like I was reading a fashion magazine. The author went into great detail about clothes. He should have spent more time on character development. Don't get me started on the main characters constant references to his fraternity. There was very minimal character development in this book. The author did not make me ""feel"" Tony or his girlfriend Monica. I did not care what happened to them.This book is full of stereotypes. I could not believe that a black author would categorize his race like that. Tony was full of ... I never want to read anything from this man again. Some ... claim that the author is telling it like it is. I prefer to think that African Americans value something other than expensive clothing and light skin, but maybe I'm wrong."
4,The Game is To Be Sold,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. Troy Martin did an excellent job developing a story line and maitaining the reader's interest throughout the novel. I could truly relate to most of the experiences of the male characters in the book. One of my favorite characters is Craig in Chapter 13.
5,Awesome!,"This book was awesome! I was truly unable to put this book down chapter after chapter! Being a college graduate, and a fellow Greek, I can definitely relate to the description of college life that Mr. Martin portrays in this novel. The manner in which the characters ""tell it like it is"" made reading this book seem as if I was reliving those seemingly unsettling post college years with an old friend. I commend Mr. Martin on his catchy and creative first novel, and sincerely hope that he brings us many more to come."
5,I FELT THIS ONE . . .,"After hunting endlessly for this book, I must say that it was well worth it! Dazed & Confused was honest and masterfully written. I expect to see more from this talented brother in the future!"
1,Do not buy this,"It arrived with no instructions whatsoever. I found the instruction manual online with a google search. First instruction was press left button and the ""screen will spring to life"". NOT! It is completely non-functional. Then I read the hundreds of similar reviews online. Note you have to go through several pages of purchased search results before you get to real reviews by customers. Apparently this product is plagued with problems with the electronics and battery function. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!"
4,As advertised,"Works fine, travels well. A little more instructions would be appreciated. Easy adjustments. I have a ""Swing Mate"", the results are not always similar, so I wonder witch is right??"
1,Display dim and hard to read,Returned first unit because display was dim and almost impossible to read in normal lighting -- not at all like the digital display readout in the product advertisement photo. Replacement unit has same problem. Product not recommended.
1,Product does not work.,"I just purchased this product in early June, it shipped fast and arrived at my house within a few days. I haven't had the opportunity to use it since last weekend.I took it out to the course, and the first day I used it, it turned on and lit up, but would not measure swing speed. I was out on the driving range, and it would show me everything, but when I went to swing with/without a golf ball, it would never measure anything. Zeros on the display the entire time.What gets worse, I went out to Walmart the next day to get new batteries, because I thought (hoped) that was the problem, but I paid $7 for batteries, put them into the medicus, and now it doesn't even turn on!The reviews people are saying on here are correct! Be careful, and do NOT buy this product from Amazon, it is not worth the risk of it not working. I am going to try to return the product, but I do not have my receipt. THIS PRODUCT COULD NOT WORK, please take my story into consideration."
1,Medicus rips everyone off!,"This company and Peter Koch, it's PGA pro ""expert"" should be ashamed of themselves! They add on video clubs that don't ship you anything but bill you every month. They purposely make it hard to contact them- via phone only and only during their West Coast business hours. They are a scamming bunch of thieves. This product died with its batteries and never would restart after battery change."
2,Medicus Power Meter,This was a waste of money. The instructions were poorly written. The device itself kept switching numbers so that I could not set it properly. I do not recommend it.
1,Not satisfied,"I used the Medicus Power meter for a couple of weeks and I love it then put it aside for a while But when I started to use it again today (April 25, 2012) the unit does not work at all. It does not power on. Maybe the battery is dead or the unit itself is defective. Maybe I should return it or have a replacement. HELP!!Jesse"
1,Shady Company,"Received Power Meter for Christmas. Used it a couple of times. Put away until spring (NE) when I tried it again and found it was dead. Put new batteries in and still dead. Contacted Medicus - no response.When wife purchased the item we automatically got billed for two different ""video clubs"" which she never ordered. Contacted Medicus by phone and they said purchase of Power Meter automatically signed buyer up for these ""clubs"". Upon request, they canceled but the other company which Medicus staff characterized as a ""related business"" refused to cancel until we fought them by way of Visa. Finally canceled. Have purchased other items from Medicus (5 iron) but never again. No support and sleazy business practices."
1,not pleased,"glad this was not a gift. i keep trying it and i return to directions, but i think it is worthless. wish i had checked out more opinions before i bought it. don't waste your money. no problem with seller, just the product. i would like to add that amazon is one of my favorite and a 'go to' websites."
3,MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN SPEED RESULTS when HITTING A GOLF BALL versus SWINGING INTO AIR OR GOLF MAT.,"I like the product and enjoy it, but I really think it is irresponsible for Medicus to not state in the instructions that you really need to hit a ball with it to get a reading you will be happy with. On a simple 6 iron, i went from an average of 75 to 86.6 the first time I took it outside and hit one shot with a real ball....Anyone else notice this major discrepancy in speed readings between using a ball and just swinging into air (or a mat)?Also, the display is kinda overly small, but this is not as big a deal as the hitting with a ball or no ball situation."
1,"Do not buy direct from Medicus, they are a well oiled marketing machine and they will bill you monthly for things you didnt buy.","I'm not writing about a specific Medicus product, because as a golfer that's an personal thing of whether the product works for you or not. My issue is the Company behind the products, I got suckered into the 30day free trial back in August on the topspin putter(which wasn't very good by the way) and here it is 12-15-11 and I'm still getting charged for 3 items that I never even new I bought. And don't even bother calling the company because all they try to do is to get you to buy more crap, sir sir do you own a ""driver"" well um yeah, well we have a special on our, NO. sir sir do you own a 5 iron, I'm like really.I always believed that they had a reputable name in the golf community, but now I see how they really operate.Bottom line is that I would never buy direct from them, I would just the local pro shop's.Hit'em Straight"
4,Check your swing speed with every swing,"A product that every golfing wishing to improve his game and scoring can use to add to his equipment and since every MPH adds 2.5 yards to the shot, this is vital knowledge."
1,Need super vision to read it.,"The data on the meter is very small and hard to read. In my case I would need myreading glasses with a magnifying glass. Still the small black on grey background makes itvery hard to see.Because of the small type, I could not even do the set up instructions."
5,Stop the guessing.,Increase your speed and get more distance using this power meter. Gain consistency in you swing for all your irons and woods. I love this product.
1,This book is badly written,"I really has a bad experience with books written by the author H-C Huang. The other one, Plate & Shell, is also the same thing. I suspect what he did are just taking the source code from their research group, modify it and to make money out of it. All the codes in those books are ""goto"" code --- code filled with goto statement. I sincerely advice those who which to buy this book give it a second thought. The technique outlined in this book is out of date, and is really fundamental stuff. It lacks insight, motivation and does not show any realistic application of the FEM for heat transfer problem."
5,Beauty and function all in one,"Of all the 2 quart Le Creuset specialty pieces (pumpkin, tomato, etc.) this was the one that caught my eye. I resisted it several times at a nearby Le Creuset shop, but when they discounted it so that the price was about what I'd pay on Amazon, I gave in. I only wish I would have bought it sooner.Unless your kitchen is totally austere and devoid of all decor, this is one piece you will want to keep out at all times. You cannot look at it without smiling and just feeling good. As far as actually using it, it has all the wonderful qualities for which Le Creuset is so well-known. Whether on the stove or in the oven, you'll love the even heating and the smooth enamel finish. When it's time to serve on the table, it becomes a conversation piece as well. At 2 quarts, it's a great size for small recipes. Clean up is fast and easy.So, beauty and function in a quality piece of cookware, and all for a reasonable price. What more could one ask for?"
1,bad knob design,You would think for the price the knob on the lid would be of a better material. Mine had to be replaced with a drawer pull knob.
2,Tiny,"I have no idea how other reviewers claim that they can cook a roast in this casserole. I have to admit it's very cute but I am heart broken that I cannot use this for anything other than to keep spaghetti sauce warm and a pretty decoration on my stove. I love it and want to use it more, but it's simply too small to cook anything other than a few potatoes."
3,No Free Gift as Offered in Advertisement,We placed an order of the Le Creuset 2 Qt. Heart Casserole but did not receive the free 7 pc. spatula set that was offer with the purchase.
1,my favorite pot,"My mother gave me an 8 qt lecreuset pot as a birthday gift. It has seen a lot of use over the last 10years. Through normal use the coating on the bottom has completely worn away revealing the cast iron interior. Are these guarenteed? If so I would love to replace it so that i can again say that it is my favorite pot.Please provide me the address for correspondence.Thank you,Jean C. Driskell"
5,These work great!!!,"These chord stamps work great, no more messy freehand chord diagrams on your music. I will be ordering the Mandolin one soon too."
3,Could use better quality control,"The stamp works, but it is actually off center on the wood block, so I have to adjust for that each time I stamp it. The size is great for writing your own stuff...so you can add your own symbols for slide, hammer, etc and be able to read it plainly. Not the best quality, but serviceable."
4,"Beautiful, but weak figure.","I got Victor for Christmas a few days ago and was happy to add him to my small collection of Corpse Bride figures. I read about all the points of articulation he had before touching him to make sure that I didn't break anything. After setting up his stand and putting him on it, I started trying out different poses. I noticed that his right arm seemed strange, but couldn't figure out what was wrong. But after his arm popped off I figured it out. The circular hinge attached to the lower part of the arm that caused it to bend at the elbow was cracked and fell apart. It looks like it was cracked before I opened it. This is very disappointing as I just got the figure and have hardly touched it. The sculpt, paint, and accessories on this figure are excellent and very movie accurate, but the weak, breakable joints really make me want to warn people before they buy it."
5,Gotta have Victor!,Victor will complete your Corpse Bride action Figure set and will match perfectly with the Corpse bride figure! Recreate the movie or make your own! Nicely Done! Great for play or display!
1,No organic certification stamp,"If buying organic is important, you may want to steer clear of this product. No certification information is provided; they simply SAY it's ""natural and organic."" This sort of misrepresentation is a first in my experience w/ a product purchased from Amazon."
2,Good Quality Very Slow Service,"The black tea is from China and quite good. However, if you want to wait 16 days for this product...order."
2,These Green Dogs are'nt funky enough!,This Cd was a real disapointment after I heard good things about the two dj's that comprise the funky green dogs. I was expecting something original and off the wall. This Cd is a collection of R&B songs not groundbreaking dance music. It was just not funky enough for me.
2,"Repetitive, monotonous","I bought this because of the fabulous singles, ""Fired Up"" and ""Until the Day"". I now know why that's all we heard in the clubs. The same dull lyric over and over again, along with the same dull beat. And what is with the almost nil mention of their only asset, vocalist Pamela Williams, in the credits."
2,Waste,"This book had a little information on very common issues in buying a house. Did you know that when selling a house you should keep it in nice condition i.e. no broken windows? I mean come on! This listed very obvious ideas, and it didn't go in depth on any issues. Basically if you have bought a house before, or even know someone who has bought a house; you don't need this book."
4,Ice Bucket,It serve the purpose. It holds ice cubes and has tongs to deliver them and seems well insulated.
3,The Houses That Sears Built,A nice overview of the Sears kit homes. A nice companion to the various catalogs that have been reprinted by Dover.
5,Works perfectly on any color pretty much,"I got this a few weeks ago to use with my new Porter Cable. This thing is amazing! The EX-P worked great on black, silver, and gray car. I applied it after the wax to keep in the shine. It has been 2 weeks since I did the cars and they look amazing. Also it smells very good! I suggest apply with another wax underneath. Use a finishing pad to apply this product. Don't mix product with others use a newly washed pad."
1,Not great,"This book was the second most boring book I had to read as a history major. I managed to only fall asleep twice during this one, though. If you must study this, read both this book and The Causes of the English Revolution, 1529-1642. They both talk about the same thing, but, as you can see from the titles, they have different opinions on what actually caused the war. Pretty dull read."
5,Superb,"Asian Kung-Fu Generation offers something that seperates it not only from American music but from most music in general: it mixes strong musical pieces with amazing lyrics. This album is, by none, far better than the majority of popular and underground rock in the American scene, and is highly recommended to anybody.Despite the somewhat high-price of the CD on amazon (it is an import, after all), you definitely get more than you pay for. 11 amazing tracks, all of which are seemingly flawless, each with their own sound and feel. Two that are especially awesome: Track 2, ""World Apart"", and track 10, ""Gekkou"".My review comes down to this simple sentence: if you're looking for great music, regardless of what genres it falls under, ""Fanclub"" by Asian Kung-Fu Generation is the perfect album for you. Pick it up, you won't regret it."
3,"Listenable, but nothing sticks","To be fair, I can barely understand 2% of what's being sung since I don't speak Japanese, but music is more than the words, right? It's a good listen as background music if you don't mind upbeat rock playing while you do other things. None of the songs really stuck in my head or were particularly memorable. Maybe I was expecting more stuff like Haruka Kanata, but none of these songs were quite as enjoyable. I give it 3 stars but my expectations were unfair, so it probably deserves a 4. Worth a listen for J-Rock fans, and anyone looking to get into the genre."
2,I don't recommend this Kitchen Range.,"I really do not understand all the fuss about this range,I can only assume that because these rather silly pots and pans have a french name that people somehow equate that with cuisine quality. I received a casserole as a gift, which was lovely, they look good and have a snob value and cache.But they are truly awful! they dry out food too quickly, they are pure evil to try and clean and they are ridiculously heavy! you could give yourself a hernia hauling one out of the oven.My advice is forget the hype and stay practical in the kitchen!Incidently, mine is used as heavy and special occassion only, tureen; a lot of money to shell out for a not very practical serving dish!"
2,"OK, but...","This book was ok, but I always felt kind of lost. It just didn't flow very well for me. I would find myself going back and re-reading passages to make sure I could figure out what was going on. The plot was good, but even for fiction seemed to be a bit of a stretch."
4,Not As Bad As I Expected!!!,"My aunt let us borrow this movie. (Is it already the 5th film and we still don't have Eddie Murphy!) Even though there is NO Dr. Dolittle again, we still have his smokin' hot daughter, Maya. Maya goes to Hollywood and somehow gets her own animal-talker show. She signs a contract that a corrupt manager makes her his permanently, she needs the help of the animals to get it back. After the 2nd Dolittle film, I didn't want anything to do with the spin-offs, but this one is not too bad. I'd probably recommend DR. DOLITTLE: MILLION DOLLAR MUTTS!!!"
5,"DR DOLITTLE,","Good movie , Dilivery was fast , No problems, SO talk to the animals and they will talk to you and you will be in the Nut house"
5,Must de Cartier Pour Homme,"I ordered 2 colognes because they are hard to find at a decent price. The seller was quick to ship, the Cartier was as described, and offered a great price. The seller is highly recommended"
2,Not worth it in my opinion,"The sensor has to constantly be readjusted and sometimes it failed to work altogether. I threw it away in disappointment. I bought this product and the ""Park n Place"" stop sign at the same time in case I liked one product over the other. Unlike this product, the ""Park n Place"" was worth the money and worked so well I bought a second one. Just type ""Park n Place"" in the search engine."
1,Do not buy this item.,"This item was easy to install, but it only works 1/2 the time if that. It is supposed to tell you when to stop your car before you hit the wall. It can not be relyed on to do this. My money was wasted."
5,So glad I read this one,"What a great study on prayer! I started doing this workbook as part of a women's study but loved it so much I bought two for family members. And my husband has also gotten a lot out of the book, even the snippets I'd quote to him periodically. Might go through it again after a few months just as a refresher course :o). Highly recommended!"
4,Live A Praying Life,"This book came to me in ""good as new"" condition. It arrived quickly and was less expensive (even with the shipping cost) then I could have bought it locally. Plus, it came right to my door. No fuss, no muss. I like that. This book can be used individually, but is meant to be part of a study group complete with the author's teaching video."
4,Amazon doesn's pack them well - they came all crunched up,"Great taste and texture, all around great cracker. The only problem is that amazon ships the crackers with no padding, to the last third of each box is all crumbs :("
4,"Great Buy, really works","Would have given 5 stars, however gave it 4 stars on the fact it takes 2 people to put it together, Love the product, it is easy to use and it works, and the price can't be beat, I am happy with my jogger, it is great."
4,stable and great video,It required a strong man to assemble it.Stability bar is great! Video is a much needed addition because it's hard to find something to do on the trampoline. It really supports the suggested weight. I think the price was a little high considering it doesnt fold.
4,jogger,"Exactly what I wanted and as described.It was a bit harder to put together thanI would have liked, but once done, it worksfine."
2,Old like me,"I grew up in Santa Cruz going to Slow Gherkin shows @ clubs, vets halls, houses, theatres, and outdoors. Make no mistake, this IS the band I grew up with meaning they grew up too. Don't expect the heart bursting BPMs recorded on the first two albums. These songs are still energetic but nowhere near frantic. Similarly, the subject matter for songs has gone from playful to personal. The biggest dissapointment for me was discovering that the technical aspects of the songs had changed so significantly. Gone are the blaring horn choruses, dramatic tempo changes, and catchy rythyms. Their arrangments are much more alt-rock now than ska-influenced. Is this wussing out? No. Is this a must have album? Only if you are a fan who has to know what became of one of your favorite bands. BUY FROM ASIANMAN RECORDS!!!!"
5,Lives up to previous albums,"Don't let the negative reviews lead you wrong. This is a solid album and even though the band's feel has changed, it's in a good way. All of the songs on the album are catchy , but the real jems are Pretty (In a Pretty Sort of Way), Baby Snake (My favorite), Human, Condor (INTENSE!), and Letterhead (gives me goosebumps).I learned yesterday that these guys since broke up...which is a shame since I would love to have heard 'Condor' live. Put this one in your collection. You'll be sorry if you don't."
1,Fiber NOT!,It looks better in the picture than in person! I feel like a fool for buying it! Definetly NOT what it's pictured like online! Good luck getting you money back too! I purchased it as a Christmas present for my wife to use at camp this season... It's JUNK - JUNK - JUNK!
1,"Poor quality product, wasted money","I purchased two of these, for our son's lunchbag and backpack. The pin part of them was of poor quality and the first one did not work at all. I had to bend the pin on the second to even get it to work and it came off before school even started. The pin is just glued to the deer and came off easily. Spent as much for shipping as for the pins, so basically I ended up spending $20 on nothing, they are in the trash now."
2,Great for beginners,"A great machine for beginners. However, for all others, you may find that the nylon bushings used in the weight carraige are awful. They create just enough drag between the carraige and the guide rods to make 50 pounds feel like 100 pounds. And the only thing in this machine that's commercial grade is the cable. Nothing more. You'll do better to spend a few more dollars and purchase a used, selectorized machine elsewhere. Craigslist, for example, is chock full of affordable, used commercial grade machines."
5,Matt Pond PA's best.,"The Nature of Maps is the best MPPA album to date. Its got a great varied sound, no two songs sound alike (well, except for ""no more"" and ""no more (again)"", but that's a different story). The integration of strings with indie-rock is amazing in this. Some of the best around. If you like music like this I would also recommend ""Into Your Lungs"" by Hey Rosetta!. But I would recommend this album as the first MPPA album anyone listens to. The album just has too many great songs. My personal favorites are ""Summer Is Coming"", ""Promise The Party"" and ""Fairlee"". My only complaint is that the album didn't come with lyrics."
4,not bad,not bad for the price..would have preferedd a lighter one with a tear drop shape..its headlight though and i liked that..
1,Troma Rip-Off + Dukes of Hazard = Alien Outlaw,"If you took a Troma movie and mixed it with the Dukes of Hazard, then you would have this movie. Other then a few boobies, this is one of those bad movies that you just have to laugh at."
5,Beautiful Accent,"I loved the antique, elegant look it gave my room. Good buy for the money, lamp shade is gorgeous."
4,What a stitch!,"I laughed and cringed at the same time. Lurie catches the awful and funny dynamics of the ""caregiver/caregetter"" relationship in Jane and Alan Mackenzie who leave behind their happy marriage when Alan slips a disc and endures chronic pain. OK, it's not Foreign Affairs, but it's still a great Lurie read. The structure of the novel and its colorful, dramatic characters make it worthy of some praise, though I note that she leaves this one off of her own website. Too bad."
4,Academic Celebrity in America at the Turn of the Century,"This is a wonderful little book. Its context is the malaise of boomer generation academics, as characterized by Alan, who is ""...pale, fat, weak, greedy, and demanding"", whose incessant back pain is a metaphor for his creative emptiness and self-centeredness. He gives up solid, if unglamorous, academic work and turns to the pursuit of celebrity, which Lurie captures well in his relationship with the shamelessly exploitive and selfish Delia. A notable aspect of the novel is the generally positive treatment of Jane, the type of middle American who sense of duty actually makes the world work, who recognizes Delia for what she is."
3,In need of further editing...,"As other readers have commented, there is little need to rehash what the book is about, thanks to other reviews. Unlike other Lurie novels, which I feel were quite original, Truth and Consequences seems repetitive and boring in parts. What starts with a strong beginning line, and compelling first twenty pages, ends predictably. The relationships are too obvious. The inner narratives-- especially Jane's-- become mildly annoying. In addition to all of this, the editing seems to be a bit lacking. There are missing punctuation marks, a misspelling of Alan's name, entire sentences that are repeated, and an overuse of the word ""clearly"". It's a quick read, but not an especially good one."
2,Ultimately a Folly,"I love Alison Lurie, but this novel just missed the mark. I didn't care about ANY of the characters. Yes, they are all SUPPOSED to be insipid lying whiners...but I wanted to care just a little bit about what happened to them."
2,Truth ?,"I don't know why I read this. The academic politics in it was somewhat amusing, but ultimately this is just a 'chick book.' And sadly, a poor one at that."
4,"Slightly formulaic, but very readable","Worthy wife Jane falls out of love with her husband Alan who has become totally self-centred because of consistent terrible back pains (the descriptions of which throughout the novel are rather repetitive). She falls guiltily in love with Henry, while Alan falls for the Henry's narcissistic, manipulative but gorgeous wife Delia. It is a slightly formulaic campus novel, and for most of the book you think it is fairly predictable; you think you can guess how it will probably end, but ... well, see whether you have guessed right. It's not as good a book as Lurie's Foreign Affairs, with which I was much more involved, but, like all her other books, this one is written with effortless ease and slips down easily and pleasantly."
4,Sly Dig At Academia,"Alison Lurie is a gifted, Pulitzer-Prize-winning author, widely known for ""The War Between the Tates,"" which is only one of her brilliant novels.""Truth and Consequences"" is a good, well-written, easy-to-read character study of a small slice of academia in a small town; it is positively wicked in it's dead-on perceptions of different academic ""types,"" from the ethereal, airy Visiting Fellow, Delia Delaney, to the quickly fracturing couple, architectural professor Alan Mackenzie and his wife Jane, Administrative Manager for the small college at which they all work. In a sly comedy of manners, Lurie examines what can happen when the scales tip just a bit: Alan's chronic back pain from an injury changes him from a sexy,loveable husband to a whining petulant child; Jane turns from a happy, contented wife in love with her husband to one who mistakes him for a stranger; and strange, toxic love is in the air everywhere.This is a fun book, and I highly recommend it, without reservation."
5,it rocks!,"Okay, so this is my first ipod, which means I may be somewhat easily impressed. Regardless, I'm VERY happy with my purchase. My only complaint would be that I don't think the battery lasts nearly as long as advertised. Other than that, it rocks!"
5,First Time MP3 Owner Friendly.. Best Gift I Ever Got!,"I have been wanting this ipod forever now it seems. I am a big U2 fan and I love this special edition mp3 player. I never had an ipod before and it's so user friendly. It's easy to download songs, make playlists and the video is awesome. Love this product! If you're bored on the treadmill, ipods are a blessing!"
1,Are you serious?,"This 30gb ipod's new selling price is $1,999.99. Who the hell would actually pay this price when you can buy a regular 30gb ipod for a fraction of the price. Of the ""special edition"" items out there this is probably the worst, ever. ""Oh, but it has U2's signatures on the back of it,"" U2 sucks and so do you."
1,Complete rip off!!,"This item was listed in ""very good"" condition however did not even work when I received it. When I asked for a refund, the seller told me that it clearly stated that the headphone jack needed to be replaced & would not grant a refund. I never saw this statement. I paid a professional to look at the iPod AND replace the headphone jack only to discover that it still did not work! When I contacted the seller with this information, asking again for a refund, they never even bothered to respond. So, buy from this person at your own risk! They're selling junk and will not refund your money!"
5,U2 SE IPOD,"Excellent, I enjoy it a lot. Its a finger print magnet like others have said. Other wise I enjoy it especially being a fan of U2 and that it looks different from your normal IPODS this will get heads rolling."
5,Great Little Grill,"I hate grilling outdoors, because i almost always get eatten alive. But this grill is the next best thing. It is great for grilling veggies, ribeye steaks and pork chops. It really gets the job done and what's nice about it is that you don't have to turn the stove up to high. It cooks evenly and gives you the grill marks and the whole deal. Clean up is a snap and I love it. One of the best pieces I have bought for my kitchen."
5,A Must Have for your Kitchen,"I love this grill pan! It's so versatile, I use it to grill fish, chicken, steak, and vegetables. It's a heafty heavy cast iron pan, which you can pass onto future generations...definitely not something you use for a couple of years and throw out. The great thing about it is that you can sear in the flavors on a stovetop and then put it in the oven for browning. You won't regret getting this. It's my favorite thing in my kitchen."
5,Simple title great book,"For the minister Dr Begg's book is basic,simple yet much needed. In a day where expository preaching is overlooked,neglected or simply considered outdated this book emphasises the importance of the type of preaching that lets the scripture speak for tiself."
4,Let's see how long it runs,"I had already used this product and it ran for about 2-3 years before I had to reorder. I would liked longer but I do use it constantly to drain a dehumidifier in my basement from about May 1st to November 1st each year. Without it, I could not store much in my basement because the humidity levels would be too high. So it's running fine now and doing its job (thankfully) and I hope this one will last longer. We shortened the tubing and maybe that will make it easier on the little guy."
1,Good idea but loses disks,"We picked up one of these for organizing the CDs at work but found it to be more hassle than it was worth. The idea in theory is good but was poorly executed since it constantly jammed or lost the disks making this the worst $100 spent bar none.The problem is caused by the carousel inside being offset by 1 or 2 slots. This causes the device to believe there is no disc were one exists or to eject the wrong disc altogether. I wasted at least 5 hours messing with this pile of crap, upgrading, opening, verifying locations and dealing with the WORTHLESS support site. I ended up tearing it apart to get my discs back.Disc stakka will be stacked right into the trash bin."
2,Old one worked fine but not this one....,I have had a Disc Stakka for several years and it worked great but then all of a sudden it would not eject the disc anymore.So I bought a new one. It arrived in visable good condition but simply did not work. Had to return it.
2,Imation Disc Stakka,"Our office purchased this item from Amazon.com; unfortunately, the item was defective and we experienced difficulty in the return process through the manufacturer (Accutech Data) that supplied the item. We are still waiting on our credit card being refunded the full amount of the purchase."
1,"Junky, flimsy, unreliable",Broke down after a few months of very light use. Flaky operation till then. Cheap construction. Would be overpriced at half the price.
1,Stay away from this equipment,"At the beginning, I really thought this is a very nice product. It does solve the CD organize and automatic storage problem for many people. However, this equipment is poorly engineered. I bought four units and all of them failed within a year for various reasons. There is no easy way to even take the discs out of the faulty units. If you ever think about move this equipment to another room, it is almost bound to fail. Customer service usually take 2 days to respond. The phone service guys do not answer questions about disc stakka because they know this is a bad product and rather not to deal with it with the disappointed customer. Imagining someone charges your $400 to organize 300+ CDs for a year and then quit. I am completely pissed off."
2,"Neat concept, bad implementation for the price","Within 5 minutes of using this thing it already lost track of 1 disc which was ejected, but it's still resident in it's ""DB"". I'd also tend to side with the other reviewers that it's inability to read a CD/ DVD particuarlly at the $120 price point is more than a little disappointing. My recommendation for the time being would be to take a pass on this unit. Based on the what I've seen on the net, the BesTradeUSA DC300 CD Library which stores 150 discs seems like a better deal, I've also seen one by Century for about $50, so my wow factor on this one is now pretty low. Personally, knowing what I know now, I'd stay away from this particular piece of junk."
2,Not really worth the trouble,"I have had 2 of these devices for about 2 years. I have found them to be unreliable in that they have both had the belts replaced and now one of the units will not keep track of where each disc is and will deliver the wrong disc nearly everytime. The support is basically completely useless as all they will offer is a new set of belts or a complete replacement if it is within warranty. The so called support cannot answer any questions regarding this equipemnt and do not appear to understand the problem you are describing in great detail in your email to their support. On top of that, the price of the unit is unbelieveable for the very basic device that it is. If it was about $50.00 it may be worth the price. When it works it is a useful tool but for the price it is better to keep your CDs in a case. I would never buy one of these devices again."
1,Great Idea - Poorly Executed,"This product is a perfect example of a great idea poorly executed. I purchased some of these units to store a large DVD location (400+ DVD). The units are cheaply made with cheap plastic parts, rubber band drive-belts and cheap electronics. In fact, opening one up is a surprise as it looks like something cobbled together from left over parts in a basement hobby shop. The units fail quickly - of the 5 five units I have, only 3 are still functional after a year. Extremely delicate, if you move a loaded unit it will almost certainly break. Getting discs out of a broken unit require disassembling the entire unit.All and all, definitely not worth the money and a major disappoint it. A strongly recommended DO NOT BUY"
1,Poor quality,Great when it was working well. Unfotunately it quit working after 6 months. This product created a lot more hassle for me than it ever saved me.
1,Sucks!,It gets stuck just when you need a disk. Stay away from this device. Missed ejected disk references. You will feel really pissed off in front of a such piece of junk with no way to get your disks. A hammer is an smart option as a recovery tool.
1,"Handy, but fragile","The DiskStakka is easy to install, and the OpdiTracker application is fairly easy to use, but the units themselves are are not very robust. I have two lightly used units at home (used for a bit more than a year) that are now non-functional. Two more we had at work have also quit working. With a 100% failure rate, I won't be buying any more."
4,You Will Like This !,"Works great for storing music collections. I have 60 CDs in mine and will buy another when it is full.CDs are safe and secure. The database can be searched for a particular CD,title or file. Can also search what is on a disc by the database instead of pulling out CD and reading it through the computer.Excellent delivery on this product also."
1,Stay away,"This product does not work and Imation's customer service is horrible. I returned my item and, two weeks later, have yet to receive a replacement or a refund. Order at your own risk.UpdateI have now received a replacement. Unit works but won't deal with Imation again."
2,worked fine until it jammed,"nice device, rather noisy but you will probalby get past that.It is now in limbo, jammed and will not eject a disk. Since the warranty is over, I'll have to open it up and see what's up.Suspect I'll wait until a reasonably priced version that reads the CD/DVD rather then using the device in the machine and then replace it."
1,DO NOT BUY Disc eject errors started occuring after a few months of use and have to continously recalibrate the unit.,"Purchased two of these units which were working as designed but after a few months one unit started having problems ejecting disks then recalibrated it and worked fine for a few days then had issues again and the cycle goes on and on between recalibration and eject errors, my second unit is now having the same issues and Imation support is useles thus they are going to the trash."
1,Don't buy this,"This item is very poorly made and prone to fail. It didn't work out of the box, wouldn't eject any disc. Buyer beware. Don not purchase one of these!!!"
1,Doesn't work!,I just got this today. The unit did not work at all. The database back up doesn't work and the restore back up doesn't work. I decided to move it to another computer and all the files were gone? This is a BAD PRODUCT! BAD! buy more storage racks. You will be far happier in the end..Jim
1,Thermo Cuts,"Order was here on time and I usually enjoy Optimum Nutrition products but Thermo Cuts was not for me after taking 2 pills in the morning I had a lot of anxiety. So I tried to take only one the next morning and found I could not complete my sets at the gym that afternoon. It took my breath away, if you can handle it take it."
3,A good start... but not deep enough for the exam.,"This book will really help get your mind geared toward the exam, but don't think that you'll be ready just by reading this book. The breakdown of topics by chapter are a great way to get familiar with the exam subjects. I read every word on every page about 3 times, and while it helped for the test, it wasn't 100% inclusive of the material you'll be expected to know. Get the practice exam book, and spend some serious time with the relevant sections of the php manual online, writing code trying out questions you don't understand/ got wrong, and going through the php-recommended.ini file that is distributed with PHP 4.*. Of course, programming experience will be helpful, but many of the subjects are in areas that you might not used on a daily basis, especially to the knowledge level you'll need for the exam.Good luck!"
1,Absolutely Terrible,"Coming from ""The PHP Company"", I fully expected this book to be ""up-to-snuff"" on everything it covered. I was sadly mistaken.I barely made it past the third page of the first chapter, and I had to shelf it. The technical errors, the grammatical errors (I know, I'm not perfect), and the cheesey analogies all made it a very uncomfortable experience.As another reviewer mentioned, this book needs to be updated to reflect the errata and such. I'm very displeased with it, and I will be sharing my opinion with Zend."
3,PHP4 ONLY!!!!! USELESS FOR PHP5 CERTIFICATION,"this is a good book, good review of the php4 language, but useless if you want to get a PHP5 certification.I buy the book cause i want to make the certification on PHP5 so i wasted my money...Could help if the title of the book specify the language version."
2,Covers PHP 4 exams,This book only covers PHP 4 not the current version of PHP 5.Hope this helps other buyers.Sam
3,Not the latest version (but still helpful),"I bought this thinking it was the latest version of the book. Unfortunately, the copy I got is a few years old and didn't cover the latest topics. Moral of the story: Make sure you can see the inside cover on Amazon. Check the publishing date before you buy.Still, it had some useful tips and information. I eventually ended up buying an e-book study guide directly from Zend themselves."
3,Useful but Riddled with Errata,"I'm only a couple chapters into the book and found have found it useful thus far with reaffirming what I know and introducing me to a few nuances that I wasn't aware of. The downfall of this book, however, is the sheer amount of errata that I have already uncovered int he first two chapters. Others here have also pointed out the errata. I hope that Zend Technologies produce an updated book with more editing, proofreading, and code verification."
2,"Worth Buying, but don't rely on it","This book was a good overview, but be careful. There are numerous mistakes in the book and on the ""practice"" tests. Not that his book will even be worth anything since the PHP4 test will no longer be given in a month, but if it's any indicator of what the PHP5 book is like I recommend you use more then one source of study material. Certain topics that are in the test were very briefly covered in the book, but I had two or three questions on it. I would recommend the cert course through Zend if you are worried about your knowledge."
2,Highly Dissapointed,I purchased this book because it was supposed to be a study guide for a certification test. From what i have seen this book is filled with typo's and error that have been corrected in the errata. Not only that but i have talked to people whom have read the guide and taken the test and they said there were things on the exam that were never covered in the book.
2,I am unimpressed,"I got the second not the first edition of this book, so at least some of the errors have been corrected. And I agree with what the other reviewers said, this is certainly NOT the book to learn PHP from. I've been using PHP extensively for four years and I thought I might go for the cert.What this book will provide you is a list of topics to know. But it fails to fill in the details, which are precisely what I forget in areas of development that I haven't been hanging out in lately.And I just can't believe that the certification exam questions are really that easy."
4,A very good complement to Ralph Kimball books,"I highly recommend this book and I think that it's a very good complement to Ralph Kimball books. It's based on the same principles and theory, and expands the number of practical examples based on real industry implementation, so if you are lucky you can find many tips and data models that can be immediately applied in your projects.You need to read the Kimball books first in order to fully understand this one, and of course some of the example are based on US companies, but most of the material can be immediately applied to other markets and Countries as well (like Italy where I work).I think that the last chapters (13/14/15) which deal with topics like presenting information and the process to build a DW are a little less interesting, but they still contain some useful tips."
1,A bad business practice,"Whirlpool Burner Infinite SwitchCan't return an item which doesn't fit your need is a bad business practice. My lesson: read return policy first, if you can't return it, don't but it on-line."
4,Whistle-blower report,"A bit of a disappointment. My wife likes the design very much. But we specifically selected this one from a number of potential ones (including one which would have matched a tray we purchased at the same time) because this was the only one which was advertised as being a whistling teapot. There's a sort of widget on the spout, but - no freaquing whistle to date on any of our uses. So I personally just use the microwave for boiling tea water, so I don't forget the teapot on the burner since it doesn't provide the warning whistle. Disappointing in that sense."
2,Just so so.......,I am disappointed in the quality of product. I paid $30 for a tea kettle with a broken lid.
3,Punny Sports Cartoons,"The authors have taken major American sports and made short cartoon books about them.The cartoons depict exaggerated pictures of common sports terms. Thus, a tennis lineman is a picture of a line judge on his back with a court line painted over his body. A soccer flagman is a bean-pole of a lineman with flags attached to his frame. ""All-Star"" game from the basketball book has three stars (five-pointed) passing a ball around. You get the idea.These are clever, though most are not humorous from an adult's perspective. I imagine these would be most appreciated by adolescents or teens who are really into the sports depicted in each book of the series."
1,"Poorly made, poor quality plastic","These are very poorly made, and completely flat, which your real teeth aren't, do not fit, nor sit well against teeth."
5,Another addition to your Lovecraft library...,"Unlike most recent Lovecraft fiction offerings, ""The Shadow Out of Time"" focuses on Lovecraft's final tale concerning Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, a professor at the infamous Miskatonic University who undergoes an amazing personality change that leads to a mysterious expedition under the deserts of Australia. Working from Lovecraft's own handwritten manuscript along with the common versions, the result is ""The Shadow Out of Time"" as Lovecraft himself must have visioned the final product.Along with the corrected text, there are the marvelous detailed notes, appendices and history that readers have come to realize as the hallmark of a Joshi/Schultz collaboration. And like other Joshi/Schultz edited volumes, ""The Shadow Out of Time"" is a must have item for the complete H.P. Lovecraft library. Hopefully many other volumes devoted to other Lovecraft classics will follow."
3,Cool comic Writers Do Spiderman One-shots,"Tangled Web is a great concept. Cool writers get to do Spiderman related stories. Volume 1 has some of the best stories including Flowers For Rhino (Rhino becomes super smart) and Severance Package(which shows what happens to one of Kingpin's lieutenants after Spiderman messes up an operation). Sadly, as a whole, the series is uneven.This edition of Tangled Web is volume III. I cannot attest to the goodness of this volume because i have not read all the issues it collects, but it contains my favorite issue of Tangled Web, #13 which features a villain bar populated by Doc Oc, Matador, Stiltman, and Whirlwind. The story centers around a Mystery Man, The Vulture, and Kraven meeting in a bar and swapping stories. The Vulture/Kraven dynamic is hilarious but the last two pages of the story would stun any spiderman fan. I don't want to spoil it, so just find the back issue or buy this book."
4,Very Funny,Highly recommanded! I started reading this play and couldn't put it down until I finished it.
2,"""Le Creuset"" 1 1/4 quart demi teakettle.","The overall (classical) stylings of this kettle do somewhat resemble it's original french cuinsine genre, but unfortunately the mass manufactured look it takes on now gives it little if any heart at all... ""Kmart anyone?"""
5,Amazing deal!!!,"This is an oversized goose down at a shocking price!! The cheapest I found was 50 bucks for one much smaller than this and I love the thickness, it's perfect for summer or winter in a climate controlled home!! I don't know how anyone can complain! The page does make you think it might come with a cover but I've Learned to always read more into the item details before assuming this by the wording. It's missleading. But great deal!"
3,After Over Two Years of Use ...,"When I first saw this item I was surprised at how thin it was, but it turned out it was simply compressed for shipping and soon puffed itself up after a little use over a couple days.The only complaint I have about it is very minor poking by the ends of feather quills if you use it without a blanket or sheet between you and it.It doesn't have any kind of odor, and I've twice taken it to a laundromat and washed it in an industrial machine and dried it. No issues either time.It's been a fabulous deal given the price, and has held up quite well for over a couple years now.Other than the poking, I'd have given it five stars."
5,Down Comforter,"This was a good comforter to buy if you live in Texas. However, I was a little upset becasue it was not as soft as I was hoping it was going to be. I wish they would have put the thread count in the discription."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"Well, absolutely nothing like the picture. I assumed there was a removeable cotton cover but there was not. In addition, I expected the comforter to be fluffy with more feathers and down but it is very thin.It was not the deal I was hoping for. Now I am stuck with 3 (2 are for presents and 1 for myself) and no time to find replacement gifts."
5,Finally a REAL book on Leadership,"A perfect book for those frustrated by leadership gospel that preaches all sorts of feel-good nonsense with little or no practical application. Admiral Oliver spells out what Leadership is really all about in candid style that ANY motivated manager (military or civilian) could identify with. Its not strewn with political correctness and he tackles the taboo topics of winning, losing, pressure, risk, etc., with practical eloquence. If you can identify with his line ""I would prefer a tiger of any breed than the purist of Merino sheep"" you'll love this book. FINALLY! Too bad its out of print, but find a way to buy it. I'd sell you mine, but it's worth far too much."
5,World's Best Book on Leadership,"I have read a dozen or more books on leadership and attended five courses on the subject (best course: Marine Corps NCO Leadership School). I learned more from this short, simple and direct guide than all the others combined.Do not be misled by the military orientation of this book. Aside from the fact that a life in the Navy presents more physical dangers than your average CPA firm, the lessons are readily transferable to civilian life (I did not spend a career in the military).I read this book a month ago and three circumstances corresponding to the book have presented themselves.I wish I could have read this book when I was 20. I would have been a better manager, a better leader and a better person"
5,Fantastic,"I agree with the other reviewers. This is one of the best leadership books I have seen (alongside Dandridge Malone's ""Small Unit Leadership""). Insightful and very well written, you will return to it again and again. I am just now ordering my second copy!"
5,Great everything!,"I don't think I have ever gotten anything shipped to me so quickly! I do almost all my shopping online, and was totally shocked to see the package from Amazon as soon as I did! The product was the best deal I have found - online or in a store! I saved so much money and plan to do a lot more shopping through amazon!"
2,"Good Story, Bad Kindle Format","The story is a good one -- not an original H.A. Rey, but good for those of us with children obsessed by all things Curious George. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is simply a scan of the pages that show up sometimes two to a Kindle page. The text is far too small to read, so they have typed it in at the bottom. Not only does it look incredibly inelegant, sometimes the text does not accompany the picture it is intended to accompany. What a bummer for my kids and for me. For the money, the text should be at least on the same page as the corresponding illustration, even with the inelegant presentation."
5,curious george,"This was a shared Christmas for my grandson and his mommy. He got the curious george makes pancakes and mommy got a pancake pan that has zoo animal shapes, a monkey being one. What great fun to work on breakfast together. Excellent idea and gift."
5,Growing happy tomatoes,"Product is easy to install, followed suggestions on plant care and tomato plants are looking really happy ! my 4 year old has taken ownership of it, follows daily progress, he has even eaten some sliced tomatoes because this is what his plants are going to produce him, got him to eat vegetables, what a miracle !"
2,"Tried it last year, not impressed","I tried it last year on my deck. It has holes for three plants. I tried a regular-sized tomato, a cherry tomato, and a green pepper. The cherry tomato was the most successful. I got a fair number of them on a regular basis. The regular-sized tomato plant didn't yield much, and the tomatoes were under-sized. The green pepper plant was a failure. It only yielded two peppers that were thin and somewhat mal-formed. Besides, it was a real pain to take down, especially with 30+ lbs of soil in it! We had dirt EVERYWHERE. I'm going back to a regular, self-watering pot this year."
3,Great tomato pot,"Grows great tomato's, well made but the plugs have to be replaced every year. After two growing seasons the bag starts to fall apart and there is no replacements that I could find. Also, it is a little tricky to water"
1,save your $$$$....,"First off, I'm a very experienced gardener so I thought I would give this a try. Bad decision. The vines grow upward so when the plants mature the weight just flops them over breaking them. Because you grow tomatoes in full sun, the plastic bag dries out incredibly fast and also burns the roots. I tried this two seasons and had the same poor results both years.It's a novelty idea and just doesn't work. Take my advice and save your $$$$$$$$$$$."
3,works okay but,I found that the planter worked just fine but I only got one season out of the bag and it's shot. At this point I haven't found a replacement for it. My tomatoes grew great and the best thing is no weeds and no ants.
1,Did not work.,"I planted hot peppers in this, with fertilizer and watering regularly... the peppers that normally reach 3 or 4 inches were not even an inch long when they ripened. Not enough root space. Don't even get me started on the topsy turvey... let's just say plastic bags promote mold!"
3,Wait & See,"Received product - been wanting to try it - could not have anything hanging from my balcony so I got the one with the stand. Easy to assemble - does not take a lot of dirt - the bag does get heavy - had it in place before I put the plants and dirt in the bag. So far it is growing very good, will be interested to see just how many tomatoes it produces by the end of the growing season. Would like to write a review after the season is over. Only one problem. We had storms and high winds and I lost the cap and the lid that sits over the dirt. I've contacted the company but they don't sell replacement parts yet. Was told they would see what they could do for me. I'm waiting !!!"
3,recall,I bought this on qvc and was later called and told that there was a re-call as it would fall over. My husband put the pole in an old flag pole hole and it works. Would check re-call out as they say it falls over.Carol R
3,Kind of imperfect,"While the idea itself is good, and I thought wow how genius! The reality is that when you try to use it things don't necessarily work out how you intend. The water gathers at the bottom of the structure and causes your tomatoes to rot or grow imperfectly. Only a few tomatoes managed to make it through, and even still I would rather eat the tomatoes I get in a supermarket. There are still a few kinks and anti-gravity tricks that need to be worked out before it will function as they say it should. I do not really recommend this as I didn't get excellent results... but it's a nice effort, maybe you can find a better use for this than I did!"
2,Would not reccomend,"I've had size 3 soccer balls before, & this one is a LOT smaller than the others. Also, as someone else mentioned, it doesn't feel like a soccer ball. It is more like a basketball. I also wasn't aware that I would have to inflate it. I think that that should be listed in the description somewhere. Luckily, I have an air tank that could inflate it. Overall, I'm not impressed. Luckily it's just a knock-around ball for the kids...but I still think next time I'll just go into a store & buy one."
4,Good,"Okay so when I purchased this, I claimed a refund quickly because I have ordered the wrong ball that i wanted. So after i told them i wanted a refund, Amazon gave me a full refund without asking me to return the ball. I'm really overwhelmed with how amazon is and i do think this is the best shopping site from all. Anyways, i have the ball, but never used it."
2,Dissatisfied,Product came dirty. Yes it's an outside item but for the price I would have rather bought one off the shelf in a store with air and a shiny surface for a few extra bucks.
1,Do not purchase this to play,"I bought this soccer ball to play, but this ball is sooooooo hard to play. I will not recommend this ball to play. May be for exhibition purpose. This ball injured my feet."
2,Not recommended,I was very unimpressed with this soccer ball. It is very rubbery and just does not 'feel' like a proper soccer ball. It bounces and plays more like a basketball than a soccer ball.On a recent trip to the suburbs I visited a k-mart/wall-mart (all those stores look the same to me) I was surprised to see that they had a very nice selection of soccer balls. I was even more surprised to see that all of the in-store options were of far superior quality and most were in the same price range (maybe a dollar or two more.)Learn from my mistake - you're not saving any money by buying this online and this is one of those things that are best bought in person.
3,good for the price,"I shouldn't really review this. The ball arrived in perfect condition. Our children loved it.However, our dog got to it before they could really enjoy it.(sorry, not much of a review)"
1,H20 Plus Sea Results Eye Mender,Do not purchase. Not worth it. Does nothing for your skin. I can get the same results with less expensive eye creams.
1,How much do I have to skip?,"If you read Andersons fairy tails, a little over half of this book can be skipped because it was published as another book."
4,A Good Read,I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Hans Christian Anderson. Overall it was good read.
3,Good Christmas story,It's always great to read a classic. This one is great because the stories are short enough to read when time is of the essence and yet you want to feel the spirit of the season. Good family time reading.
1,A Christmas Greeting A Series of Stories,I was disappointed this was not what I has expected from Hans Christian Andersen. I can say I didn't read but 1 of the stories all the way through I just skimmed them because I couldn't get into the story line.
3,Not what I expected,"When I ordered this, I thought it would be a few Christmas stories. I knew it was by Hans Christian Andersen, and I love some of his fairy tales. These were also fairy tales, and taught lessons but they were a little hard for me to understand. I didn't finish the book."
2,Could not hold my interest,"Hans Christian Andersen writes some delightful books, but these short stories are not part of it. I just couldn't get interested in them - and they were not Christmas stories which I had looked forward to reading this season. I'll move on to something else."
5,Grandma and the roses,"I read this book on an airplane trip to Flint, Michigan and loved it!! The part where the grandma never got to smell the roses was my favorite. Buy it and read it."
4,Extremely durable,"I love these for the price and durability. Great cord length for running and using an armband, belt, or pack. I have put my pair through a 12 hour ultra marathon in 100 degree heat, tropical rainstorms, and freezing temps without performance problems or discomfort. The best! Would give 5 stars if sound quality was better."
2,Disappointed .....,Originally after I bought these headphones I really liked them. But after awhile the blue plastic ear protector kept falling off & I kept having to adjust them while I was working out. They are sweat resistant the only positive feature I can truly make. Overall I am disappointed with this product .
3,Nice workout headphones - but not really for small ears,"I brought these headphones to use at the gym, and have been using them for 6 months now. I knew that I did not want wrap around headphones, and these seemed like some of the better workout headphones that Amazon offers. In fact I got these to replace a pair of Griffin EarThumps/Earphones which I enjoyed but died about a year after I got them. But that is another review.So in short, these headphones fit somewhat awkwardly on small ear, because they can't lie flat against the ear. You do have to listen to your music quite loud, but even with the not so hot fit, these things do stay on. I have jogged in them, done aerobics, and weightlifting, and nothing has budged them. Would I buy these again? Probably not, but they work, they stay on, and they are pretty cheap."
2,stick but poor sound effect,"Yes, it is tight, it will not flip off my ears when i am jogging, but i only used it once and find a big disadvantage of it - the sound is really poor. the earphone itself is so far from the ear that when I am jogging, wind just hide the sound of earphone. so I guess it may not suitable for outdoor sport. If you want to use this product outdoor, need reconsideration."
2,Great sports headphones - if you have the right ears,"I'm forever looking for a good pair of headphones for running. Primarily my previous ones have failed for one of two reasons, either the bouncing from running makes them fall out of my ears, or sweat gets into them and they cut out. I had high hopes for these Panasonics because it looked like the over-the-ear design would resist falling out. Well, they don't fall out. But, after about 3 miles I am overcome with the pinching pain from the way they sit on my ears that I pull them out. The sound quality was fair to good and they never overloaded with sweat, but that's because the speaker sits away from the ear, not inside it. Other reviewers have said the same thing I have, they're good phones but if you have ears of an ogre, skip'em."
4,"good for sweaty, sweaty","Working out at the gym for about an hour, 30 minutes heavy aerobic, 30 minutes weights; then into the sauna. The headphones have held up with good sound quality. They have lasted much longer than the Sony sport I had previously purchased. Within 1 month with the Sony, I began to get static. Comfort level: I gave a 4/5 because occasionally at the end of a workout the back side of the ear is slightly tender. Doesn't always happen, Sound qualify 4/5 rating for the type of product. The sound quality is good for a sport headphone. This is the best I have found especially for the price. Definitely a bargain;"
2,Good for everyone else but me...,"Like others would say, the ear clip was not really a good fit. It would slowly slip off, but I was fine with it. The reason for my 2 star rating is that my right headphone stopped working just after 3 months of using it..and it's supposed to be sweatproof!"
3,Cheap in cost and quality,"For the cost, I guess they're worth it, but don't expect them to be anything great or even that good. I bought them hoping they'd be a comfortable pair of headphones that I wouldn't need to replace after a couple of months b/c of sweat. Well, I don't have to replace them b/c of water damage, but the shape of them tend to hurt my ears and so I can't wear them very long without discomfort. Also, the length of the wire differs greatly from each ear piece to the point at which they converge; i.e. the right ear piece has a wire that is substantially longer than the left ear piece.Definitely will not buy again and am hoping to chuck these as soon as I find a decent pair of waterproof headphones."
1,"Don't fit, fall off all the time","I have small ears and I constantly have to adjust these headphones. They do not fit properly and are always sliding off, even when I am just sitting at my cube at work. They are uncomfortable to wear, and the cushions fall off too when I take the headphones out of my bag. I wouldn't recommend buying them."
3,Good design for spots but sound suffers,These earphones fit well and appear to be very water resistant as the mfg claims. Problem is they are an 'on ear' design and don't really couple well to the ear canal. As a result the bass is almost nonexistent and the overall fidelity is not much better than a cell phone. I was using these with a new Pioneer XMP3 portable XM radio and was initially disappointed in the radio as I could not get the volume loud enough. I then switched to a set of el cheapo earphones and it sounded like a concert hall compared to the RP-HS11's. Volume was not an issue with any other earphone I tried.These may be a good choice if you are jogging in the rain and don't care about sound quality but they didn't cut it for me.
1,Extremely Uncomfortable,"I can't even fathom what they were thinking when they built these. It's as though they didn't know the anatomy of the human ear because they do not fit with the ear structure whatsoever. This results in a very uncomfortable experience, which was really the only thing I wanted when I bought these headphones. I already have Bose QC3's for sound quality, I just wanted these headphones for their convenience and lightweight, like when running at the gym. They failed miserably. I would recommend looking for other headphones."
2,Not What I Would Normally Expect From Panasonic,"OK, I know they're cheap headphones, but come on! They are flimsy, don't fit well, and the design of the attached cord makes you go ""what the...""! Why on earth did they feel the necessity to make the wire attached to each headphone a different length? I don't get it and, maybe it's just me, that really offends my natural sense of symmetry!"
4,"Good quality, good price","I bought a pair of these for myself and my husband. He loves them. I find the hard plastic of the ear hook to be uncomfortable, after a workout I take these off and the tops of my ears are a little sore. My husband hasn't had this problem at all, so maybe it's just me. If the hooks were softer rubber instead of hard plastic, these would be perfect. Looking at the product photo here, maybe panasonic has made that change? The ear hooks on my pair are not like this picture."
4,love them,they are great for working out. the sound is good and they stay on my ears really well. plus they are washable!!
5,"Five months, so far great","These headphones are the style I prefer in the gym (each ear independent, clip on), are very light and don't get in the way, and also don't soak up sweat like most others. I've been using them every few couple days since January and have had no problems with either comfort, cleaning or functionality."
3,Ok but not the best - try Panasonic HS22 instead!,"These are OK, but not nearly as comfortable or as good generally as the Panasonic HS22 earphones. I thought the sound was OK and the fit seems OK at first, but after wearing them my ears are slightly sore. I quit using them."
2,They weren't as good as I had hoped,"The main reason I get these, like most people on here, is because I can't wear ear buds. I used to have a pair of Panasonic clip-on headphones (which are now, sadly, discontinued), so I thought I should try these. I can't seem to get them on correctly (maybe my ears are just weird?) and they were uncomfortable no matter how hard I tried. I felt like my music was leaking out all the time. If anyone has any advice on how to put them on correctly, I would love the comment (I did read a previous comment that explained it, but it still wasn't working for me)."
4,Great for Runners,"I love these! I run in them and they stay on and sound great. Plus, it doesn't matter if you sweat on them. I highly recommend them."
3,Hurts my ears,"I bought these thinking they would be an upgrade from the cheap pair I bought 3 years ago at Rite Aid. They are just 'ok'. Nothing great. After a 4 mile run, I had these on my ears and when I took them off, it felt like a had been wearing a cheap pair of glasses and it felt as if my ars were bleeding. Yes, they stayed on my head ok, but still, ouch. I've kept using them hoping they would get better with time, so far, all I can say is, try a different pair. I'm back on amazon looking to replace these."
5,"Great, especially for working out!","I hate hate hate earbuds and I hated my old headphones falling off when I want jogging, to the gym, or when I did abs (I had pair of Sony's in a style similar to these).These headphones are great. They lock onto your ears securely, they don't budge while I'm running, doing jumping jacks, doing abs, or at the gym. They're also very comfy.Some users have commented that they're hard to put on. At first, they're a little counterintuitive. But, they don't take long to get the hang of."
2,Where's the bass?,"The clip-on function and the rubberized washable earpads are a good idea, but don't make up for the lack of performance. I have an ipod shuffle, whick as you know doesn't put out the most amount of power. My old headphones were Sony behind the neck wraparound. I would have to crank the volume control to the max to get any loudness. These Panasonics looked right up my alley since I use the headphones for working out and running. They are super lightweight, and I don't have to worry about sweating up the foam pads since these are rubber. However, the volume level did not increase, even though these are smaller than my old ones. And as far as any bass goes, forget it! They sound hollow and tinny. Nice thought, but I'll stick with my old ones. Will maybe try the Koss clip-ons."
1,Not so great,"At first these were great! However, I took off the removable piece on one ear. After I put it back on it continued to fall off. I tried running without the removable piece, but the headphones would fall, or flap up and down on my ear. Very annoying. I am training for a marathon and, needless to say, 20 miles of flapping earphones merits the 1 star. My recommendation to the manufacturer is that they find a way to secure the blue removable pieces. When they are secure they work beautifully..."
2,Pointless purchase,"These headphones are not good for sport use as advertised. Beyond shiftiness while set in place, there is a TON of audio leakage. If that doesn't concern you- go ahead. For the price, they play ok. If you want to rock n roll while active, I'd recommend another purchase all together."
2,Not right for bass-heavy music,"I listen to rock or metal at the gym and these headphones just don't provide enough bass for that full, rich sound. They are perfectly fine for audiobooks and other genres that depend more on high tones such as electronica, but unless you're ok with a severe lack of low tones I would skip over these. They ARE, on the other hand, extremely comfortable. One without the other doesn't quite cut it if you ask me.Just as a sort of disclaimer on my opinion, I also find most ear buds (in-ear headphones in general, actually) seriously lacking in sound quality... i.e. I'm pretty picky."
2,They hurt to wear,The behind the ear clips are very uncomfortable and they include some edges that begin to hurt the back of my ears as I wear them. It usually takes about 20 minutes before the discomfort becomes hurt. The washable pads have a tendency to fall off and I've lost all of them now. I cannot recommend these headphones. Sound is good.
3,"Decent running headphones, just not very durable","Well for the 20 days I had these headphones, they functioned the way I needed them to.-Easy to clean after a sweaty workout-Locked in place over my ears-The clip kept the cable from moving excessively during long runsFor those 20 days they were fine, no complaints about the sound qualtiy. I knew what I was getting into (You can't expect Bose quality at this value). But then, the left earphone went and after looking at the construction, I'm not surprised. This is made from inferior parts and even the cable could use some minor improvements (the cables tangle so easily). I would prefer a flat cable."
1,This bag DOES NOT CLOSE?,"I bought this bag to use as a overnight bag and to take on weekend trips. The body of the bag easily fits the amount of clothes etc required for a few days away...BUT the bag does NOT CLOSE. AT ALL. Apparently ther is some sort of built in hidden magnetic closure that is supposed to secure the top flap to the front of the bag. This does not work (at least on my bag).WORSE STILL, even if this magnet thing worked, the sides of the flap are still totally open, and anything small that you have in your bag can fall out if thebag is in anything but a perfectly upright position.So much for using this as a carryon bag, or putting it in the trunk of a car. It is totally unreliable. I am definitely returning this bag."
5,THE BEST JUNGLE MIX EVER RELEASED INTO THE MASSIVE!,"I've heard about every jungle dj live and this is the only cd that depicts what the scene is all about. This isn't drum and bass, IT'S JUNGLE! The tracks are so perfect that it seems like this is a 70 minute song, not a mix. The mix starts off jazzy and loose with a new tune called ""The Mexican"" finishing it off. Then, here's where the emotion starts. The track by High Contrast is so freaking great, I wouldn't hesitate when calling it the best jungle song of 2002. Then the 'isht really hits the fan. The rough sounds and amp dropping bass is in every track! That's hard to find these days. if you enjoy ANY type of electronic music, then you'll definetly get a...for this mix!"
5,An album so good it was stolen from me twice...,"If you want some high energy tunes this is your CD. I was really impressed with the drumming and beats. It's not going to let you down. I originally bout this CD 10 years ago when I was getting into the rave seen in Seattle. I haven't heard much like it, though I would like to.Does anyone know of any other music like this? Or maybe a harder version of it?"
2,Not helpful,"As a parent of a colicy/active baby, I've went through several different books, looking for help. This book was not helpful. It was basically nothing more than you'd find in a magazine article. It doesn't have any real solutions. Instead I'd HIGHLY recommend ""the Happiest Baby on the block"" especially the DVD version. This was unbelievably helpful to me and I just wish I had found it sooner."
3,"Adorable, but arrived damaged.","The pot arrived packaged very poorly. The lid was jammed upside down into the pot, with no padding or packaging between them. This resulted in gouges all the way around the lid and ruined the enamel. I'm going to try to exchange it for another. Very disappointed."
2,Mediocre,This book deserves 2 stars in respect for the brilliant past of Jodorowsky. MOebius (Jean Girard) is really a must in this team.
5,Great Product,Gentle on the leather and cleaned very nicely. I would highly recommend this and other Mother's products.
5,works well,using on a '76 tbird....lots of leather...dries and smell goes away. very happy...this is my second bottle on this car. very happy
3,where is the leather smell?,"Cleans and conditions fine, but am wondering what has happened to the leather smell...smells like suntan lotion now )-:"
1,Mother's Leather Cleaner ruined my leather FlexSteel couch!,"I sprayed Mother's Leather Cleaner on my $5000.00 leather FlexSteel couch and it instantly took the color out! This is horrible crap. I figured that leather cleaner would be good on leather. Apparently I'm badly misinformed! This stuff shouldn't be sold to anyone. The container says the ""Manufacturer's liability limited to replacement of product or refund of purchase price upon return of unused portion and proof of purchase."" So, basically, there is no warranty for things they ruin.I will post a photo showing the arm of my couch. My advice is to never even consider buying this crap!"
2,book is too small,Exercises in the book seem fairly good. There is a page for each state. The problem is the pages are very small. The maps are small and the symbols are tiny. I bought the book to help my son improve his map skills but so far we have spent more time finding ways to make the map readable. He can't learn to identify the symbols on the maps we we can hardly find them and there is no space to write the answers to the questions.
5,"No-Age and Dub, Engaged in Eternal Battle","The absolutely fantastic 2nd album from one of the great underrated instrumental punk bands. The sonic equivalent of the primeval birth of a blasted desert world, and the winds that still rip through the vast canyons of its ancient landscape. The carefully crafted and cadenced rock-dub tracks, like ""Clockwork Dub"", stand out like great stone monuments, in memorium of a direction dub should have taken, but never did. Thank you, Andy, Gabe, and Ted."
5,More Than We Deserve (And It's About Time!),"Doug Sahm (along with Tim Hardin, Fred Neil, Tim Buckley & others) was a spot-on National Treasure who was mostly ignored/misunderstood/underappreciated by record companies & the record-buying public. That we finally have Doug's ""Sir Doug's"" back in the CD bins is something of a minor miracle - these GREAT collections of Doug's sublime musicmaking should be on the radio day & night (and won't make a dent on the playlists because NO-ONE in radio - even oldies radio - cares about music - only playing the same crud that is safe, safe, safe). But Doug put these records out anyway - real music, full of the joy of writing & singing & playing. Give a listen to ""Be Real"" - you won't be able to resist grabbing your sweetie & giving her a turn around the dance floor. (Oh, and those horns on ""Pretty Flower""!)By the way - I would have bought both of these albums if they were sold separately - how sweet a deal!!"
2,frustrating,"I bought this book to do forecasting for work. The authors' names looked familiar, but I thought maybe an obscure article or footnote was the reason. Then, after going through this book, I realized the reason - Wichern is the same guy who wrote the utterly confusing, frustrating, and represensible Multivariate textbook myself and fellow graduate students were subjected to (and promptly ignored in favor of better books on the subject).This book is a perfect example of why textbooks suck - professors get tenure by publishing and other professors do the evaluation. Learning or effectiveness never comes into the equation. So, as a book for impressing other professors, this book is a huge success. But as a book for actually learning how to do forecasting, it is an utter failure.With the advent of the internet, there is better information about this subject on-line (like Wikipedia), written for people who do real work. I gave it two stars only because it is a moderately useful reference."
3,"A good text, but frustrating.","The book presents the topic of forecasting in good, methodical way with examples and illustrations from Minitab. It the book also illustrates the procedures on how to work with Minitab.However, it appears the book may not have been updated for the changes in the Minitab software. As such, trying to replicate the tables and output illustrated in the book is very frustrating. As a student trying to learn the basics of forecasting, it is not possible to tell what errors are mine versus being due to differences in the software.The supporting student website only contains data sets. An update to the tables and exhibits at the website would be helpful, as well as mentioning the existence of the website more than is currently done in the text.Other than the frustration caused by the tables and printouts not exactly matching the current Minitab printouts, it is a good, understandable text that would have rated a 5."
1,Beware enamel coating,The white enamel coating transferred to the burner when used on an electric stove. Bad design.
2,Vanilla-flavored Advent Devotional,"About halfway through Advent and I realize how disappointed I am with this. Not to say it isn't good or that is filled with heresy, it just doesn't offer much in the way of new perspectives. If your faith is very tradition-bound,then you will enjoy this book. If you believe that God is constantly engaging in revelation, then look elsewhere for a fresh take on Advent."
3,"A worthwhile read, especially for young people.","This book provided a nice insight into Montel Williams, the man. The book was short and uncomplicated, and I read it in two days. Montel and Paisner do a decent job of keeping it simple. The chronology of the book enabled the reader to walk through Montel's life with him. The reader will learn that he is an ordinary man who has done extraordinary things with his life. Readers may even get renewed and set some goals of their own. However, the book does have some cliches` in it. He does a nice job of discussing the ever-present topic of his interracial marriage. After reading this book, I re-committed to some goals of my own. This book is worth a read, while not being very expensive."
5,"Trust in Mind, Faith/Mind sutra","The Faith/mind poem or sutra is a well loved and important piece written by Sengcan or Sosan Zenji, the 3rd Zen Patriarch. This poem is rich and accessible, and no matter how new or old to zen practice a student might be the sutra contains many levels of teachings.What is wonderful about this book by Mu Soeng, is that he not only includes numerous translations of the poem by zen masters such as Suzuki and Sheng-yen, but he also delves into the history of zen at the time this poem was written. I tend to find history a dry subject, but Mu Soeng keeps it interesting and pertinent. This book is valuable not only for the sutra it contains, but also for the great insight into the evolution of zen practice.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in deepening their practice or anyone interested in how what we know as Zen has come to us in the form that it has."
1,More Chan Buddhism = psychotherapy,"Another tiresome 'psychotheraputic' commentary on one of Chan Buddhism's most revered poems. To believe this writer all Chan Buddhism has to offer is confirmation of Freud and Jung's theories (with new and exciting ways to put them into practice). All the wonders of Chan Buddhism reduced to psychology. What a pity!I am not suggesting that psychotherapy isn't helpful, only that there may be more to Chan than just resolving such issues, and if so, then this 'psychologizing' may stand in the way of something wholly different and more wondrous, as Chan's long and glorious past might suggest."
2,Ruth Gordon,"I adore Ruth Gordon, but find all her books very difficult to read. She wanders, she rambles, she digresses.You really need a guide to get through her books."
2,This Pulitzer Isn't Any Prize!,"Talk about a lullaby...yawn! The Prize Pulitzer garnered 2 stars from me only because I was able to complete the book. (I award one star ratings for those so boring I can't even finish...which has only occurred once in my life) Ms. Pulitzer seems to try to capture our attention with the shock value of her oppulent, dreadful, twisted life. A life filled with stupidity would more accurately describe this ridiculous biographical account of Pulitzer's life. Though one does have to sympathize with her plight at the end of this piece, you are left wondering how she could ever desert her newborn babes to travel with her husband. He, by the way, is the only character more dull in The Pulitzer Prize. Perhaps if Ms. Pulitzer had been more independent, wiser, & more assertive, she wouldn't have had to pen this worthless tale of woe. Reading this book was akin to chewing on raw pizza dough."
2,not very creative,"With the word creative in the title I was expecting a more original style of decorating, or at least a broader range of styles. Instead, the style of this book is primarily tradional/cosmopolitan. I do not like that style, so that is probably why I don't like this book. I found it rather boring. The photos are not too bad, but nothing special. I have to admit I was too turned off by the photos to bother reading much of the text, so perhaps the written information would be more useful to people, but I doubt it. Two other definitely more useful books would be The Kitchen Planner and Better Homes and Gardens Complete Kitchens. I reccomend that you skip this book."
2,bussines planning,I would like to get more information about bussines planning especially quality management including human resources business planning in the last decade.
5,"This is a ""must-have"" guide","Some books belong on a shelf in the library; not this one! As a quality practitioner, this book stays on my desk where it belongs - in active use! ""Improving Data Warehouse and Business Information Quality"" is a 518 page source of enlightenment and should be considered mandatory reading; not only for Data Warehouse professionals but for every knowledge worker and business manager. This book ""delivers the goods"" and then goes the extra mile by transcending industries and corporate levels to promote a deep understanding of quality concepts. Not only does Larry use relevant examples to show causes and effects of poor quality, he also shares practical advice that is meaningful and can be readily implemented. Larry's writing style and human component make reading this book very enjoyable and thought provoking. I have used this book for over four years and found no other book to be as relevant and useful."
1,Don't bother,"This CD should be re-labeled ""Set the Synthesizer on 'Guitar' Mode"" or ""A Midi-File Christmas."" What has been recorded is not the sound of a real guitar, but some kind of digital imitation -- blatant false advertising. The cost of shipping so that I can return this piece of junk is a gross overpayment."
3,for older children,I bought this to put in my sunday school class but the concept of God the spirit is a more advanced than my 4 year olds understand. I suggest this one for older 5's or 6's. The pictures are fabulous!
4,"Love my perky, one-person tea kettle","This cute little 1.5 quart tea kettle, perfect when just one person wants some tea, graces my stove with its dark blue flowers on a lighter blue pot. It's an improvement on other models I saw at Target because it's prettier and the whistle gizmo stays on, making it unlikely to break, become warped and difficult to insert or get lost! The only change I would make, given design powers, would be to have the handle and top of the whistle be blue instead of the pale green. I am taking to heart the importance of drying it out after use to avoid the possibility of rust."
1,Silly to sell these live organisms without refrigerating them in transit,Basically if you look at the Natures way website they say these are live organisms and should be refrigerated. That means that if you mail these without shipping them in a coldpack (which would mean shipping them within a day) they lose their potency. This also means that they are supposed to be refrigerated from the time they are produced to the time they are shipped to a consumer....So what I am saying is that since none of these producers quarantee that they are refrigerated at their source and then shipped in some sort of cool pack none of these items should be sold mail order.In addition you dont know what the expiration date of these items are. The shelf life should be at least a year and 1/2. So unless these items are refrigerated during shipping and you know what the expiration date is (stamped on the bottom of the bottle) No one should sell these items online.
3,please refrigerate this product...,This product needs to stay cold and it arrived without a cold pack. I won't be ordering this again due to the fact there wasn't a cold pack.
3,A Disappointment,"My first shock when I got this long-awaited book was how slender it is! I could not imagine how a book with large print and that thin could contain much useful info. I was disturbed by the author's attitude of 'it's up to the sick person to get well...if they don't (yet) want it for themselves, there's very little you can do.' While I do believe in a certain amount of mind over matter, the truth is one cannot simply heal themselves of this horrid disease & many people want nothing better than to be well & aren't. It isn't from lack of trying. There were small amounts of useful information in this book, but it was certainly not worth the [money] (plus shipping) that I forked out for it. So many folks with this illness do not have money to blow and yet most are so desperate for helpful information that we find ourselves continually searching and spending. I would spend your money elsewhere. I would only recommend this book if you can borrow it from someone else!"
1,There is a reason why its $9.95,I recently received this 3 D Cell LED light and promptly installed 3 new D cell batteries ... with the copper top ... it didn't light ... after several tries and then adjusting the spring load at the base it flickered ... then tried the tried and true shaking the darn thing seems to have worked ... but ... it barely gives any light and compared to a 2 D cell mag light its pathetic.My advice ... stick with the LED mag lights ... this one is a not well made and is useful mostly for self defense.
4,Railroad Church-pre built,Comes ready to set on your layout. Plastic is sturdy and appears it will weather outside well.
2,Frommer's Nashville and Memphis,"This was not a very good guidebook. The directions were not always accurate and the maps (a very important part of a guide book) were not very good. The book is poorly organized, so that you are constantly having to page through to find information."
3,Pretty good overview,"Although Memphis should have it's own book. This is a decent overview of both cities. If you are just planning to visit Memphis like I was, try Nicky Robertshaw's Memphis book. It is much more in depth"
5,Spiral bound Cape Cod map,It is awesome and I think anyone traveling should pick one up because there is nothing that compares except maybe GPS!
1,Something Was Floating in It!,"Amazon quickly took care of my problem with this and sent me a refund, which was great! The price can't be beat! But it had this cloudy, moldy looking stuff floating in it. Yuck. I decided that Amazon was not the best place to order this. Otherwise, I've used this lube before and it's great! It's the only kind we use. Stays slick and doesn't irritate your skin. Too bad it had to go in the garbage."
3,Works well,"Quality product and in a container that functions very well. It's a little thicker than other lubricants, frankly the personal lubricant sold by CVS is a little nicer and less expensive. This product does clean up easily and there's no odor, it's just that I expected something better for the price."
3,Not as good as expected!,"As a personal, water-based lube, this product is too thick and doesn't remain slippery very long. The scent is definitely cherry but the flavor is not quite 'spot on'. The KY product is definitely better."
4,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good water based lube. It lasts quite a long time and doesn't make a mess. It does the job, but I do prefer the silicone based lubricant over this though."
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Don't waste your money on this version of Swiss Navy Lubricant, use the silicone based version. The lubricating properties lasts only for a minute or two."
4,Pretty Skirt,The skirt was very pretty. The pics don't do this skirt justice. My six year old loved it.
5,Fabulous book; a must for the home library,"This is a fabulous book. It's one of the two best ones on homeopathy I've come across, and I use them both all the time, though this one is perhaps even more comprehensive, and with even more beautiful illustrations. (The other one is ""The Complete Guide to Homeopathy"" by Lockie and Geddes). For the interested layperson, this book will very much help you figure out what you can do for what ails you (and your family). I've had some great successes using it, as has my husband. It's quite a beautiful book as well, and makes a nice gift. I asked for it one year for my birthday, and have put it to good use ever since."
5,"Mission to Chara, A Cold War Thriller","I was captivated by the technical accuracy, the insightful look at Russian culture, and the suspenseful plot. I, also, have been a zealous fan of Tom Clancy novels dealing with military adventures and rank Lynn Boughey's work with the same esteem. As a former commander of the 5th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Minot AFB, North Dakota, I know his background and applaud his efforts and his recognition of a tremendous group of dedicated people. I eagerly look forward to his next book. Keep it up, Lynn!"
1,Technical Manual,"This is a great book if you are looking for a technical manual. If you are looking for any characterization, however, don't waste your time. The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts serving to prop up the real star of the story, an inanimate object, the aircraft. No real craft in the storytelling, very cold and distant."
2,These are not Victorinox knives,"These knives came labeled ""ECONOMY STEAK KNIFE"" Made in China. They do not say anything about Victorinox. We tried them and they seem to be good knives but not Victorinox."
1,Disappointed and mislead,"I have some of the Victorinox steak knives that I purchased locally. We love them. However, each knife is stamped with the name ""Victorinox"". I purchased these and when I received them, they had no Victorinox name on the knife and said, Made in China. The product picture at the time I purchased them had a photo of the knife with the Victorinox name on it. I see that has been removed. However, I was out the shipping cost to return them. They are not a deal if they are not the same product. Buyer beware!"
2,I got 12 knives for under $5 ..... Oherwise I would only give 1 star,"Figured not quality but good utility/stake knives to have arround. They're ok, decent 'cheap no name quality' but I find the serations are just too serated (too long and pointy with deep gaps) which makes them fairly useless on most things. They really grab! hold and make it difficult to cut.NO WAY ARE THESE QUALITY."
4,"Sound, Simple, But Right of Center","Being that I am a Christian who is left of center theologicaly, I was weary of buying a product from conservative-fundamentalist, Chuck Swindoll. The video does go out of its way to paint scientist and the scientific world view as being non-believing aethists, which leaves Christians who believe in the theory of Intelligent Design out of the loop. However, the 30 minute video was excellently animated with 3-D graphics and the attack was subtle enough that only a hyper sensitive left of center Christians like myself would notice. All in all I think it is a great video and a wonderful way to introduce young children to power of Christ."
4,Good bucket,you can carry alot of tools and get quick access to all of them without opening a bunch of drawers in a toolbox. Better than the round bucket.
2,Not so great,"I guess you get what you pay for, this was hard and cheap quality. I didn't like it. I kept it because it wasn't even worth sending back."
2,Disappointing,"I am an avid reader of erotic novels, and I found this one rather poorly paced and the characters somewhat two dimentional. Everything was just too easy (no pun intented) for Jenna and the ending, as another reviewer pointed out, was poor and a bit of a let down. I admit I had trouble finishing the book. Have a main character in the fantasy fulfillment business is one thing - making her a prostitute is another. As this was my first book by Ms. Lloyd, I doubt I will read another"
3,"The First Part is Very Good, Then Wright Loses Me","The first part of the book is worth the purchase price, so go out and get it.Wright shows clearly how unbiblical our typical concepts of Hell are - they are more based on legend, culture and literature (plus some fundamentalism) than the Bible.As the book goes on, Wright's theological liberalism starts to show through (it's amazing we are in the same denomination - PCUSA) and he starts to lose me. It seems that what Wright wants is a church or theology where nobody feels any pain, particularly with regards to Hell. While I agree that the concept of Hell has been abused in the past and present by some (to keep people in line if nothing else), wanting a pain-free theology doesn't seem to be realistic. Some of my most profound experiences with part of Him have been considerably painful on my part, for my ultimate benefit.The possibility of experiencing Hell, on earth or on the other side of the Jordan, really SHOULD be scary."
5,Not be be missed--one of my favorite resources!,"Bonnie Harris' book, ""When Kids Push Your Buttons"" is refreshingly respectful of parents. Rather than an ardent ""This-is-the-right-way-to-parent"" manifesto, it is instead a supportive, relevant resource that helps parents figure out how to parent more from love and trust, and less from fear. What parent hasn't had their buttons pushed? Whom do you know that couldn't benefit from relating better to their children? Don't we all want to enjoy parenting more and parent more on-purpose? Bonnie Harris' book helps you do just that. The tone of the book is warm, realistic, helpful, and personal. I read it one and half years ago and loved it. I re-read it a few weeks ago and got even MORE out of it. The parents I coach have embraced the concepts in the book because a)they work and b)they respect that parents can trust themselves. If you're looking for a powerful process for helping you relate to your children and yourself more positively, this is it."
1,"Get glass, ceramic or stainless steel vacuum canisters",I upeeled a spiece of scotch tape from the stainless steel veneer. The veneer came off. I will no longer use this type of canister. It could not be fixed and it is too much trouble to return this faulty product. I washed them all and water spoured into the tops. I had to shake it out and wait a couple of days to put dry ingredients into them.
3,Not as I Expected,"The author seems to have a very good industrial experience. However, he was not able to put that experience in an organized way. A large amount of the book is devoted to listing different types of components used in different cars. Every electrical system was explained in long paragraphs with not enough sketches to support it. The sketches are very basic and I think it would be a good idea if more advanced sketches were included, at least to match the text."
3,good,"If your;re a beginner, and you want to go farther , or you just want a basic understanding, this book is a good primer. It will definetly get you on the map and get you started on the right path."
4,this book is a must have,The book has a lot of valuable information. Its easy to read and has a lot of good tips that a novice can understand.
3,No wiring section,This book has no section on automotive wiring at all. Good for the other stuff but severely lacking on this important aspect of automotive. I bought this book thinking it would have a section on it.
5,Period music at its finest!,"If you like music with 19th century flavor, get this CD! I enjoyed every cut and I can't say that about very many CDs of period music. Speaking as a guitar player, the slide work on ""Trudging up the South Fork"" was superb! As manager of the gift store at Sutter's Fort State Historic Park in Sacramento I immediately made this CD a part of my inventory. Give it a listen. You'll be glad you did."
1,Enraged,"Quite possibly one of the single most offensive albums I have ever heard in my life. All the subtlety and genius of Bach is erased and what we are left with is a fragment of a theme placed over Rhythm changes (!). Where is the integrity of these musicians? It may be cliche to say but I am sure Bach is rolling over in his grave. It is thoughtless, shallow ideas like THIS that give jazz a bad name when it comes to depth and substance. I hope that anyone with a slight appreciation of music will be able to see through this transparency"
5,Qigong for Everyone with Debi Dunn,"I have this dvd and would recommend it to anyone of any age with virtually any medical issues. As a nurse who suffers from many medical issues, including fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue, I can honestly say that the regular practice of Gigong has significantly decreased my stress, and my pain and has aided in relaxation and sleep. I am able to bend and touch the floor with my knuckles!! That's right. I could NEVER do that before. You will fall in love with Debi's soothing voice and will appreciate the simplicity of the moves and instructions. The meditation will just take you away. My 7 yr.old granddaughter loves to do the DVD with me and especially loves the Bear and Crane moves. Great to help her relax on a hectic day or get in some exercise on a rainy day. You will not be disappointed. Viewing the location where the dvd was filmed is more than worth the price of the dvd, but the instruction is truly priceless. This is a must buy!"
1,Very disappointed,"I've listened to some pretty good audio books, but this isn't one of them. This audio book is full of platitudes and anecdotes but offers very little useful information or ideas. It tends to ramble aimlessly without making a point. As a result, I found myself rewinding the tape over and over in a futile attempt to follow the author's line of reasoning and glean some value from listening. In the final analysis, it turned out to be one of the more disappointing audio books I've listened to, definitely not worth the time invested. I usually save audio books once I am done with them to give to friends, however I have thrown this one away rather than waste another person's time with it."
3,DragonFly Shower Curtain,"Ok, I just hung this curtain so i'm unsure of it's durability. I just wanted to let everyone know that WalMart is selling the curtain, plus the dragonfly hooks for $22.22, a steal compared to the $40 Target/Amazon wants. It's very pretty and I really hope it doesn't fall apart like past reviewers have stated. Although, I wouldn't be as mad as those who paid $40......Happy Holidays!"
4,Very Pretty Shower Curtain,"Quality and style good value. It is such a unique piece. Dragonflies are ribbon embrodery that had to be reinforced on the back side after first wash. This should not make you hesitant to purchase, however. Only a few were loose. I wish there had been cafe curtains or something else suitable for bathroom in same material/patten. The shade of tan has not been easy to match."
4,LovesDragonflies,"I haven't had any issues with my curtain and it's been hanging in my bathroom for over 4 months now. It's very simple and neutral so I can change the color of my towels to change the look of the room. I hope it doesn't rip, but so far so good."
2,Shower curtain falls apart,"I had the same experience as the first reviewer. I thought someone had ripped the bottom of the shower curtain about a month or so after I had put it up, but apparently the bottom separates fairly easily from the rest. It's unfortunate because I had a really hard time matching my bathroom and this was perfect. Now I have to find something else to match the waste basket and toothbrush holders."
4,Coby CD/radio/cassette player/recorder with remote,"I found this on Amazon for a really good price with OK reviews. I ordered it and actually got it free with my Amazon credit card points and it also came with free shipping. Who can pass up a deal like that? Sure, it's not the high quality of some but it works well and was just what I was looking for at the right price. I would have given it a 5 star rating except that the remote didn't work, but that didn't matter much to me. If I'm too lazy to walk to the radio, then I don't need to listen to it. I'm very happy with this."
1,Cheap Plastic Eats Cassettes,I bought this because I needed a cassette player for my daughter who is taking singing lessons. Out of the box I noticed it was cheaply made and felt fragile. The cassette player ate the first cassette. I was able to extract the ribbon and rewind. I inserted a second cassette and it ate that one also. The ribbon was broken upon removal.
1,Not Working After One Month,"Clearly I wasn't needing a high-end CD/cassette player when purchasing this. I was hoping that by keeping it in one place (not moving it around) and dust-covering it between uses - ""uses"" meaning about 30 minutes daily - that it would have a decent lifespan. Initially, it was perfect for what I wanted; however, after one month, the 2 woofers sound disconnected (no bass, all treble) and the vocals on music CDs are no longer balanced with the music - unintelligible and somehow over-reverbed. I do not recommend anyone purchasing this. I would rate it a zero if that was an option."
5,Cassettes and CD's!,"This is a very nice medium size portable stereo with a CD player AND a cassette player. Purchased for a grandchild that had grandparents that still had cassette tapes to play as well as CD's--so it was a great find! A nice price for all it does and a perfect size for a small child to use for a long time. Not a ""toy"", but a ""real"" CD player--small but mighty! Highly recommend it."
1,do not recommend,"i bought it to listen to tapes for work purposes and it played the tape one time, and then never played any tapes ever again. the cd player works still, but i do not recommend to others."
1,CD player broken within days,I was very disappointed in this product. The CD player was not working within days. I will try to find a way to return it.
3,Suitable for a young child only.,Functions work well but the sound quality is very poor suitable only for a young child.
2,"Works great, sounds bad","The so called ""full range speakers"" are very tinny with no bass or ability to adjust sound. Everything else works great. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,A good compact unit for the price,I ordered this CD - tape - radio combination for my mother in law as a gift and it is perfect for her needs. It's compact size fits well where she needs it to be and the sound and quality are amazing.
2,poor cassette quality,This product is not a good purchase. I bought it to play both cd's and tapes. The tape player is awful...the door will only close if you wiggle and jiggle the cassette just so.....the cd player works well. I would return it but it would cost me more in shipping than this machine cost in the first place.
1,ripoff:,"I purchased the Coby Portable with the remote November 10, 2011. It only worked a couple of months. I do praise dance at my church and really needed to be able to rehearse so I purchased the item. After a couple of months the CD player stopped working and the cassette player stopped working - I have a cassette in that I had to resort listening to and now I can't even open that to retrieve my cassette. I am so very disappointed with the product and the fact that I lost my money on such a lousy investment."
1,DO NOT BUY ANY COBY CASSETTE,I bought this it hade a problem with the CD it made some funny nose in middle of playing I tried a different CD and same problem so I called them and they told me that I could return this but I will have to pay the shipping to them so I tried to go to the store were I purchased it I retuned it and they gave me a new one. But with the new one I hade anther problem that the tape that I put in get stuck and winding and ruined don't buy from coby they sell junk and broken items
2,DOES NOT RECORD LIVE,THIS UNIT ONLY RECORDS FROM RADIO OR CD. NOT LIVE RECORDING WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO. RECORD THE GRANDCHILDREN PLAYING MUSIC.
1,one star is even too many!!!,"I'm sorry for this review,but each one of my kids gets ONE Christmas gift...... I ordered this item in plenty of time and never got it....So one of my kids had nothing under the tree. Think twice before using this company...It's a shame... I have NEVER had a problem with anyone else! A VERY SAD MOM AND CHILD! Elizabeth M Storms"
3,"good value, decent sound","Pretty happy w/ this little boom box. Everything works well, reception is good & the sound is crisp, but very little bass. If it holds up, it's a good deal at this price."
3,disappointed,"I am happy and unhappy at the same time. I received my stereo and was a little confused. It was suppose to come with headphones, it did not. It was suppose to have a antenna, it did not. I can not contact the seller so I will just let people know about my experience. The good news is that the stereo actually works great, even without the antenna. The headphones would have been nice (especially since I paid for them). Other than that I really like it. So judge for yourself. I really do not want to return it because it works so well. I am afraid I will not get anything close to this. Just wish my items were all included."
1,does not work,I just received this radio and the cd and remote does not work what the hell i hate it so much....disappointed
3,Just OK,"I just got this item yesterday via Amazon Free super saver shipping..The product looks atractive but dont look for a quality built..I tried the CD and radio feature, yet to try the cassette one..Sound quality is just OK with little bass and enough treble. I bought this to put on the Kitchen where my Mom can listen to some music while cooking. It is not definitely suitable for your living room. I hear some noise when the CD starts palying or when I change songs.I would say a good buy for background music if it lasts for an year atleast."
1,You will waste your time / money,"I purchased 2 of these, my fault for not reading the reviews first. One was for myself and the other a gift. Both of these would play CD's but not tapes. The tapes would play but instead of going to the take up side the tape would fill the inside of the machine untill it was full then quit working. A real hassle to get out. I thought the problem may have been the age of the tapes I have so I purchased some brand new tapes and they did the same thing. Live and learn I guess. Amazon did accept my return and has promised a full refund, maybe they will elimante this product."
3,Good Buy for the Money,"So, we all know that this technology is way out of date. But, I must buy a single CD Boom Box for a blind person to keep it simple in operation. This does the trick. Now, whether it will last long enough is the question. Simple to use. Good sound. Plastic casing. Small size is great. But, must have a gentle touch for the controls."
2,Not Worth $30,Save your $30. I ordered one and it worked well for a cheap boombox. You do have to finagle the cassette to get it in far enough for the door to close. So I ordered another as an extra for home. Same problem with the cassette door. Now both boxes are chewing up(irreplaceable)cassette tapes. For a cheap box it has pretty good sound. Radio and cd player are fine so far. Just don't try to play cassette tapes in it. And that's the reason I ordered them.
3,Easy listening,"It works fine, delivered quickly and a good price. The remote does NOT work but the base is just fine."
4,Good product for the low price,"I purchsed 2 Coby CX-CD250 for our weekend school teachers. The product plays CD and cassette, it is a Convenient tool for our teachers with affordable price. We are happy with this product, thanks.Showin"
2,Dissatisfied,"I know this isn't an expensive machine but still the CD player quit working in less than 6 months. The remote control only changes the CD track. No power switch,no volume control. All a bit disappointing"
1,sucks,this boombox sux and the remote is useless it only changes the songs for the cd! and it doesn't even turn the thing on or off...waste of money!
1,Very Dissapointed!,"I'm more mad at myself than anything. I read the reviews and knew that some people claimed the cassette player didn't work. They were right! If the box hadn't inadvertently been destroyed, I would have returned it."
2,CD Player Can't last for long periods of time,"I bought this CD/Cassette Player for my daughter for Christmas. She has used it for 3 weeks and there didn't seem to be any problem until I was listening to a CD. It worked for the first hour and then started freaking out. Then it wouldn't play the CD anymore. Its only good to play 1 CD and then it has to rest for a couple hours.I bought a new CD player because the one I've had for years wore out. I'm pretty sure we aren't that hard on CD players. The old CD player that we have(the one we wanted to replace) works better than this new one. Also it is not very loud, you almost have to turn it up to full volume to hear the music."
1,CD stopped working in 3 weeks,"All I needed was a cheap CD player to play white noise in my kid's room. Thought this was a good deal, but 3 weeks after I received it, the CD player stopped working. What a waste. You'll want to buy this, you really will, but don't."
1,AMAZON GAVE ME A FULL REFUND,"I bought this mainly for the cassette player because they are hard to find these days and I have a lot of tapes. As soon as I got it, the tape player would play but would not rewind or fast forward so in other words I can't use it. I called Amazon and they gave me a full refund and said I didn't even have to send it back. One star for the player, five stars for Amazon!"
1,DO NOT BUY ANY COBY PRODUCTS,I bought this cd/tape player 45 days ago from Amazon and it seems like the product is not working properly. I have lost 2 audio tapes already as it got stucked inside while playing. I called the Coby company for an exchange or fix. They advised me to send them Money order of $12.00 for shipping charge. It does not make any sense as I have alredy spent $29.00 to buy this item. Their customer sevice is not good and it seems like they don't care. I would suggest anyone to aovid Cobby products.
1,Not worth purchasing,"After reading some reviews, I was skeptical but I thought others were harsh - after all there were some good reviews. If I hadn't waited 6 weeks to use it, I would have returned it. The CD player basically does not work - it searches for the CD but can't find/recognize it. We purchased it to play lullabies for our new baby but the sound is so poor we feel that it is not a good idea to use for her. I would not buy again and would not recommend it."
1,COBY Portable CD Cassette Recorder,"We used the CD player one time. The next time we attempted to use it, it would not play the CD. We ended up having to return it because it was defective."
1,Don't buy!!!,The player stopped working after less than a month. The manufacturer says it must be returned through the retailer. Amazon won't take it back. I guess I'm out of luck.
1,This product never worked right.,The CD player of this never worked right. I have barely used it and it will not play a CD at all. I have it for my classroom and I am the only one who puts CD's in it. The CD never plays...I have tried everything. I will not buy a product from you again. VERY DISAPPOINTED!
3,made cheap.,"Yea came broke nothing I had to send it back for, but still broke. Duriable for it being a 5 year olds radio. He loves it that's all that matter."
4,Still working,"I had a difficult time locating this type of portable unit. I looked everywhere and had to turn to the internet. I specifically wanted a tape deck that I could start and stop in order to transpose notes and it held up through several tapes. The CD player still works after several years now and the unit seems pretty durable. It's basic, inexpensive and reliable."
3,Average,The shipment was EXCELLENT! The product was ok except for the button operation REALLY needs improvement.Must press extremely hard on them and afraid I might break them.
4,Great value,Great value for a relatively inexpensive portable CD player. Has all the features we needed and the look is stylish. Delivery was VERY prompt. Sound quality is amazing for a small unit. We couldn't be more pleased.
2,Radio reception is extremely poor,"I own another product by the same company and had no problem, so what the heck, I will get another one.But this model has extremely poor radio reception. It gets only about 1/3 of the stations I can get with a similar radio.Considering how little I paid, the sound quality is all right for listening to voice recording, and the remote controller is not very useful.I thought about sending it back, because of the poor radio reception, but since my son (who uses it primarily) only listens to recorded books on casettes and CDs, I decided to keep it."
2,Poor recorded sound,"I just opened the Colby CD250 and heard some great sounds from CD, cassette and radio. But recording them was another story. When recording from a CD,a big hiss can be heard between tracks and during soft sounds of the songs. The unit is supposed to have a volume leveler. It does not. The sound quality of recorded music from CD or radio is very poor. It plays back distorted and, if from CD, the hiss I mentioned before. The unit is good for tapes recorded elsewhere, CDs and radio. But if you want a unit to record CDs or radio, get something else."
2,Limited CD player life,"I bought this unit to use in my bedroom. I wanted to have music or listen to recorded books in the back of the house. I've only used it about 30 times in the past 2 years. Now the CD player rarely works. I played one of three CDs for a recorded book and then the next ones wouldn't play. We've not been able to get anything to play on it since. It had great sound and works for radio. I've never used it for casettes, so I don't know if it works or not. I just know I won't buy a Coby again."
3,Cheap boom box,I bought this for my work (Chipotle) in the back because we needed a cheap radio. I'm happy with the price it is OK overall. The positives is it gets a pretty good signal and is economical but the negatives are that there is not much bass and its not a digital tuner (you have to turn the knob old school style to get the station you want). The CD player works good though. And you can use a tape converter thing to play ipods through it. Its good for the money just be gentle with it
1,Disapointed with this cd player,"I didn't like the quality of this cd player. The sound was very poor. Also, the way the cd player opened was very awkward. In my opinion it would be worth it to buy a slightly more expensive, better quality cd player than this one. I don't recommend buying this item."
1,Poor FM Radio Performance,"This product had all the features that I wanted but could not keep ""on station"". After a short time of use (less that half an hour) it would wander off the station. The FM tuner was not able to lock on a station. I would not recommend this product if your primary use is to listen to radio."
1,So disappointed,"I have never written a bad review. If something I buy doesn't meet the expectations, I let it go. But in this case I have to say that this stereo is nothing but a piece of junk. Within one week, the CD player totally quit. I went to the tape player... and it never worked. I have been listening to the radio for the last months and now it comes and goes. I have it at work and tomorrow, it is going into the trash. The only thing that worked was the remote... but it's pretty useless without the CD player. Bottom line review... a 1 is too good for this machine. Don't waste your money."
1,Do not buy,I purchased this item for use in my classroom. It worked great the first week. I should have called customer no service sooner because the warranty for the radio part is for 30 days....but the plug has a warranty for a year. Unfortunately the plug is not the problem...it's the speakers........ that don't work! Don't waste your money!
2,CX-CD250,It only lasted a few months with light use and never being taken out of the room it was used in. The CD function doesnt work properly but skips on the first song of every CD. Now finding out how they will warranty it!
1,would never buy this again!,I am using this cd/cassette player in my classroom and after 4 or 5 weeks the play button is not working on the cassette player. I am very disappointed in the quality of this item!
1,Failed CD Drive,Product failed after about 45 days.CD player fails to drive to CD Track.End product review.
4,Use the force!,"The new ""Vintage"" Original Trilogy Collection Obi-wan Kenobi is an excellent addition to any collection. Detail on this model is very good and the newest feature, the high degree of articulation, makes this 3.75"" action figures competetive with 12"" action figures.The jedi robe on this figure is a little to oversized and the knee joints lack any articulation so this figure comes up a little short of being the perfect action figure, but it's certainly one of the best. Lightsaber detail is outstanding. Get one before they sell out!"
3,What happened to his arms??,"I like this figure overall, except... his arms were cut at really odd angles!!! Other than that it's an ok figure."
2,not good,was not at all what i expected broke coming out of package very expensive for item i received cheaply made
3,"Love it, but sad about the arm","I'm a huge fan, and I was soo excited to get the figure. After moving her skeleton arm twice (very very carefully), the elbow joint broke. Part of this is poor design, sad to say. The joint is very weak. I had read reviews on how delicate it was. Even being super super careful, it broke. My advice would be to leave it in the box. While I loove having it out, it's frustrating to me that it's broken."
1,Corpse Bride figure is too fragile,"My wife purchased a Corpse Bride action figure for our 16-year old daughter to display on a shelf. It arrived with one hand broken off (the skeleton hand), and when my daughter attempted to change the position of the skeleton arm while posing it for display, the arm snapped off half-way between the elbow and the shoulder.I agree that the figure looks great but it is just too fragile to be played with or even posed. There is NO ""action"" in this figure.I just hope Super Glue works on it."
5,the next level of fusion,"last exit is probably the best fusion ive heard since miles davis' work of the 70s. this builds on the framework davis created then, but completely taking it to the next level, a goddam firestorm of sound that becomes the saddest blues and the most melodic jazz in a matter of seconds. EVERYONE on this album deserves attention, not just sonny sharrock, though he was probably the most intense guitar player the earth has seen since hendrix's passing. brotzmann, laswell, jackson, and hancock all give incredible performances, esp. on the last song, where herbie's delicate, lilting piano lines are raped and impaled by brotzmann's blistering sax. laswell and jackson also, as they make for one of the most interesting, skilled rhythm sections ive ever heard. i can't praise this album (and this band) enough."
4,Back to the Future Part II review,Watch this awesome sequal andP.S. Iam still waiting for (spoiler alert) my hovering skateboar and my flying car.I LOVE IT!!!
5,One of my favorite Mac Dre Albums R.I.P.,Someone stole my old copy I looked everywhere for this album and I finally found it here. Album slap straight Bay classic
4,Excellent thesis-like coverage of PLL communications math,"I purchased, read, and refer to this book. It is good. But different from my other PLL books. On a higher more technical level than the other PLL books which I have reviewed. Reads more like a thesis than the other PLL books. I feel that it covers exactly what the title indicates, more wireless communication and space-based PLL coverage than the other books, except no 'implementations' except at conceptual mathematical level. Not a circuits book. No circuits to copy/use. Much more of a pure PLL communications theory book."
5,"""You are part of the Rebel Alliance, & a Traitor!""","I saw the new retro-figures yesterday in my local store and instantly snatched them up (I paid nowhere near the 10.99 price for each, though).The Princess Leia figure is a new resculpt,& comes with the trademark white gown (made of cloth), bun hair-do and her laser pistol she used at the beginning of ""Star Wars"". The figure card has the retro-image from the 12 back card with a new ""historical"" back to it (also, lists the other 11 figures that go with the full set). The figure is housed in a protective plastic case with the ""Star Wars"" logo in raised letters on the back.As for people pis*ing & moaning about the price, grow-up & stop being such a tightwad. We all know you bought the figure & are happy with the purchase. Unless, you want to shell out the big bucks & try to get the 78-79 original."
4,Much better Leia,"First of all, this is a HUGE improvement over the ""monkey face"" Leia from the POTF2 figure in from the mid-1990s. It's an appropriate feminine version of Leia. The face looks a bit too ""doll-like,"" but the body and sculpt are good and she's got decent articulation. I haven't seen any better versions of the hair-bun Leia since, so get this one if you want to recreate the Death Star rescue scene."
3,$10.99 for a new figure?,"Normally, SW figures are $4.99-$5.99. This is a SW figure packed in a pseudo-Star Case, which isn't worth anywhere near an extra $5. Toy collecting is doomed to repeat the mistakes of the comic book industry, little by little.With that said, the unpunched card repro is cool for someone who has never seen it before or had an original carded figure when they were younger. However, the nostalgia wears off rather quickly. Be aware that the figures are not the original casts and the card back is different, previewing the re-release line. Kind of spoils the fun."
2,Good memories spoilt,"The title of the CD is ""Scary"" but don't be fooled. The only thing frightening is that someone might be suckered by the reputation of the conductor and some fond childhood memories into spending good money for this crud.While there are a couple of admirable tributes to classic horror theme songs, the cheesy vocals on Addams Family, Ghostbusters, Monster Mash, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Beware of the Blob and Thriller relegate this disc to the trash bin.Instead of this, I'd recommend Nosferatu (James Bernard), Chiller (Cincinnati Pops), Fantastic Journey (Cincinnati Pops, also - more SciFi than horror, though) and Classics From the Crypt (RCA Victor). All available here."
5,My favorite skillet!,I love this skillet. Wish I'd had it many years ago. I've been using mine for over a year now and even purchased one as a gift for my daughter. The non-stick surface just won't quit. It's a nice heavy pan without weighing a ton like cast-iron or without having to worry about it rusting if I don't happen to reseason it properly. It's a wonderful value for the money.
5,great frying pan,Great frying pan and for descent price. And it heats up more quickly than the Analon I had before.
2,Wearever Anodized 10-inch covered skillet,"While the pan handle stays cool, the lid handle heats up with the pan. You need a pot holder to use the cover. I didn't like that."
4,Good music by a wonderful singer,"My first exposure to Sissel was a movie - Marie Antoinette, I think - where her voice was the first thing I heard, during the opening credits. I then spent the entire time in the theater waiting for the end credits, so I could find out who that singer was, and check out everything of hers that I could get my hands on. That's how strong an impression the beauty of her voice made on me.This specific album is one of her (relatively) pop-style albums (as opposed to her classical albums, where she sings arias and classical art songs), and of her pop albums, this one is my favorite. ""Solitaire"" and ""Should It Matter,"" in particular, are wonderful songs - listen to these when making the decision on whether to buy."
3,"Nice voice, but the music is so so","I got to know this artist after the movie Titanic and was very impressed by her vocal in the haunting music. Without further advertising she seems to fade from the scene, until a few weeks ago I heard an interview with her on NPR (National Public Radio). I was so glad she was releasing her first US album.But after listening to it, I'm somewhat dissappointed. No doubt about her angelic voice, but the music itself is just so so. The melodies are not impressive. I was hoping for echoing effect that makes the music sound very deep. But I don't get that. Some of the lyrics are so corny (something like ""till end of the time"")The CD I bought happens to be defective so I have an perfect reason to return it."
3,Resolved,When this item was received it was in the correct jacket but contained a wrong c.d. The item was resolved o.k. But could have been prevented if the sender had just checked before sending. Good businesses have quality control - the rest are never better than just o.k.
1,Not what I expected,Sorry but while this lady is no doubt a talented and gifted performer her efforts as provided on this CD did not really touch me. I would suggest that before buying a Sissel CD that the interested listener first try her tunes on a download service.
5,Stellar US debut for this popular European artist,"Sissel once again proves she is a world-class caliber artist, and will crack the American market wide open with her innovative style and a return to uncomplicated themes, both of which the US has been seeking for awhile. This is her first solo US release, but those who already know Sissel's blend of Celtic, Folk, and Classical influences will be able to hear her vocal progression on this album. Fans of the Europe-only release, All Good Things, will appreciate this album even more, due to improved song selection and a clear, solid voice."
2,Eh....,"This album was 9.99 on sale where I bought it...and I think I paid about 6 bucks too much. Her voice is gorgeous, but the music is kind of blah. I'd take it back if I could. But, on the other hand, it's decent background ""mood"" music. It's not staying in the car. :("
3,Sissel,"SISSEL. Beautiful voice. Most of the songs were sterile. One of the best versions of ""Shenandoah"" that I've ever heard."
2,"Meh, maybe adequate","Most of the songs on this 2002 U.S. are so much better done on her 2000 international album, ALL GOOD THINGS. Frankly, I think the U.S. company viewed/views the U.S. audience as a bunch of dullards who have to be kept from the good stuff, lest they demand better. Comparing this, uh, meh, rather boring album to ALL GOOD THINGS is akin to listening to Pat Boone's versions to experience Little Richard and Fats Domino R&B."
2,Sissel's American debut is rather lackluster!,"Sissel's classically trained voice is wasted on this set of bargain basement songs. Hailing from Norway, Sissel is best known for those ubiquitous ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" in the blockbuster movie 'Titanic's' score. On this, her stateside debut, various Scandanavian songwriters provided a whole album full of just about every lyrical cliche and banality in existence. ""When your fingers touch my skin."" ""I'm all alone in the rainfall.""The production is so flat and charmless that you might be left wondering whether you're actually listening to a collection of hastily assembled demos. Sissel has obvious talent and beauty, but is urgently in need of some fresher, more melodic material and a much more competent producer. Avoid this one!"
5,definately worth a try for anyone!,"i just went into my local grocery store because they USED to carry this stuff-only to see they no longer do. Im going to let a whole bunch of Fourth of July people down because word quickly spread that I was to make my chicken Khorma and I was getting excited calls...I can no longer find the star ingredient of this simple, delicious and different dish, but Ive found it here on Amazon and I will be buying it for when I get a hankerin'. It might interest you to know that my toughest critics-two teenaged boys-really love it served over jasmine rice. And if they like it, then you know it's not too spicey or too different for your family."
2,Something missing.,"If you have nothing else this is acceptable, but it definitely lacks that special something my two local restaurants seem to have in the korma. I was disappointed. Possibly it was too mild. I could tell from the aroma it was different from what I had on my recent Lamb Korma dishes while dining out."
5,The Best Whipped Cream,"Talk about a big hit with our family and friends! The whipped cream comes out perfect (as long as you screw on the nozzle tip so that it is level). I don't have to worry about beating the heavy cream too much or too little as when making homemade. I can easily decorate my desserts. The taste is far superior to the pre-made canned bought in the store. I can control the amount or kind of sweetening used.When making our whipped cream, I put 3 heaping tsp. of powdered sugar in an easy to pour cup/bowl and add just enough heavy cream to form a smooth paste (this way you avoid lumps). I slowly mix in about half the pint of heavy cream to get a nice liquid and add about 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract. I then pour this liquid and the rest of the heavy cream into the chilled canister and assemble as directed in the instruction book. I plan to try real maple syrup instead of powdered sugar for pumpkin pie."
1,junk,Another piece of crap from China! I will pay for quality if someone out there can make it ....go get um USA!
1,Piece of junk,"Don't waste your money on this one. Tried to adjust it several ways so that we could use it to peel apples. It gouges out the apple, slices it up at the same time (don't want it sliced up) and makes a complete mess. I would have returned it as it is new but they only give a tiny window for return so beware this one. It is a complete piece of junk!"
5,the book i always go to,"this is the number one book that i always go to cause it has enough pictures and it also has the info that I'm needing at the time and it's fairly easy to grasp , over all out of 5 different kinds of books like this this is the one that i would chose to take with in a pinch"
4,Let's be careful out there ...,"Along with its companion volume 'Twang and Echo: Classic Guitar Music of the '50s', this book provides a richly-illustrated account of electric guitars and their manufacturers from a seminal period in the history of popular music. From the classic to the bizarre, from the familiar to the esoteric, they are all here in big picture and full-colour. Its magazine-type layout and writing approach makes for very easy perusal, providing an entertaining overview of the period and these fascinating time-pieces.BUT BE WARNED ... this book was previously published in 1996 in hardcover under the title 'Classic Guitars of the '60s'. To the best of my knowledge no mention is made anywhere of this in the write-up."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased this for my 5 year old who is a die hard Thomas fan. He saw a photo of one in an add and had to have it for Christmas. To our dismay, within 5 minutes of him opening it, the Thomas picture on the front fell off while he was pulling it out of his pocket. We tried to reattach it, but it continued to fall off and is now lost. It actually looks like they used rubber cement or some other sort of glue to attach it to the front. By the second day, the chain broke when he was taking it out of his pocket. My son was so disappointed and I am extremely frustrated. I paid nearly $[...] for something that was probably worth less than $1. Save your money!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Disappointing quality,"I loved the picture of this bracelet in the Ross-Simons catalog so much, I ordered it direct. Now, having received it and looked at it really closely, I can see that the quality of the pearls is poor, and I'm overall disappointed, although the catch is very nice, and it is a secure one. I'm reluctantly going to return it. I would prefer to have spent a little more for better quality."
2,Konica Minolta Wide Angle Lens for Z3 and Z5,"This lens has several issues:1) Bright lights cause vertical streaks across the field of view due to internal reflections.2) This lens has no threads for filters. I usually use a protective UV filter to prevent the lens from getting scratched.3) I noticed some pincushion at the edge of the field of view.If I am carefull how I frame the scene avoiding bright light sources directly in the fov (lamps, light bulbs) you can take some good pictures. The camera when notified of the wide angle lens does not allow any zooming and sets the Z3's zoom lens to fixed position. This seems to minimize the pincushion at the edges of the field.I give this product a 2 stars out of 5 rating. Internal reflections should be avoidable with proper optics design. Threads for filters is a feature I do miss.-WW"
5,All the tracks are winners,"This CD features Scandinavian ambient/chill music from Stockholm, Sweden. The writer/producer, Stefan Lundaahl, has really served up a great selection of sensous, high latitude dreamscapes, ideal for the autumn into winter season. The tracks are deliciously slow, but have a definite rhythm to them, and each one has a different view to offer. There are some vocal treatments by Linda Martio, and other guests, which only enhance the dreamy quality of the music. To get an idea of the spaces created here listen to track 1 (Underdub) or 3 (Sunbathdub). I've been playing both on the airwaves in Alaska, and listeners keep calling in to find out more about the music. Definitely a good sign."
3,Second Rate Civil War Music,"This potporri of Civil war tunes played by a selection of US service bands falls short on many levels. For one thing the CD is under 60 mins and yet is a top priced item. Also, many of the selections on here are copied from other Altissimo titles. So there is not much original music here. Its hard to know why ""Amazing Grace"" is here other than just for additional filler. Yes, the tune was known back then, but its hardly Civil War era music! Altissimo! just threw it in to add a few minutes more to this CD. The linear notes are an improvement from the none-existant ones of the past, but overall this is a second rate Civil War CD. The modern arrangments of the music also do not carry very well."
3,Incompatable with computer headphone,The only input is a telephone handset/headset square plug. It is not compatable with a headset which has the seperate audio and speaker plugs which are on a computer headset.
3,Hard to follow,"for me it was hard to follow at first. It took me some time to understand what was going on in the movie. The start and the end were confusing to me. I had bought it to see how Yumi Yoshimura was as an actress; I feel she did an excellent job in the movie. I'm a Puffy fan so I wanted to see her performance. The main theme of the movie was about bullying that was a problem in Japanese schools and revenge, etc. Some of the scenes were over the top by American standards but I tried to keep it in the Japanese prospective. I feel I would not have bothered with the movie if it wasn't for Yumi Yoshimura."
2,Revenge Flick But to Slow!,"First time director attempt to deliver a twisted tale of troubled young psychopath who was tormented by a bully who scars the boy both mentally and physically. This leads to him to create a split personality that brings out a violent side when angry and or bullied. Although the movie is violent, the scenes are rather spread out and far an few in between. It plays out more of a drama then a a revenge flick full of blood and gore. When it comes down to it , the movie had potential but falls flat due to horrible pacing."
2,Another Rule: Do Not Compare Your Movie To Fight Club,"The violence was okay, seemed more like a bad Anime movie.Doesnt hold a candle to Fight Club, no real similarities other than the story point listed on the box."
3,Low Priced Fun,"Very low budget, poor fidelity, no liner notes, cheap packaging....BUT....It's lots of fun if you enjoy old movies, big bands, and the obscure. The cut of ""Am I Blue?""(featuring Hoagy Carmichael and a young & juicy Lauren Bacall), from the Bogart film To Have and Have Not, is easily worth the price. Take a risk! Live a little!"
1,What Was I Thinking When I Bought This Thing?,"The first four tracks are killer, tight-sounding songs. Take ""Up Against the Wall,"" off the Peace/War comp: it absolutely rips! And then the live tracks circa 1985 aren't as great, but the ""In This Life"" portion of the album, which would be from track 7 to 17, is just completely emo. Yuck! I get an uneasy feeling listening to these whiny songs, and cringe at them. I can hear traces of AFI and Dag Nasty and Tiger Army, and just, well, bands in which I'm embarrassed to even mention their names. What a shameful purchase I've made. This'll go right next to that Cheap Sex album, in the shelved category! ""Wait,"" ""Buy This War,"" and ""Up Against the Wall"" should've just been tacked on to the end of Complete Vol. 2. If you're looking for a glorious punk rock gem, AVOID THIS!"
4,Changed how I taught Science,"This book is more than just a ""hands-on"" science book for teachers. It actually helps you adjust lessons you already teach so that students become inquiring, exploratory, and problem solvers. Students gain confidence in their own ability to find solutions and approach problems. I used this book in college, and now will purchase it again (because I think my roommate grabbed mine) to help me plan out the upcoming school year."
5,Stunning!!,"One of my favourite posters of all time! just a mesmerising red that catches the eye and slight details in black, simple yet amazing! The print is spectacular, an amazing piece of work!!"
4,NICKS PS ROLLCAGE REVIEW,"ROLLCAGE is a great game for PS1, released in 1998. In the game every car can go over 400 to over 1000 MPH. You start with cars that can go over 400 MPH! Each car already comes with a driver what you can' t change the car driver. There are tuns of races & tournaments to test your skills on & win new cars & tracks! (note the game is a PS1 game so the game will have bad graphics, coloring, sound, and audio on nomatter what TV you play the game on!) thanks and have a great rest of the Summer!!!"
3,The Theme are worth the Price,If you like the Haunting Music of CSI then The Investigation Suite and Grissioms Theme are worth the purchase.
4,Very Well Done,"This soundtrack is very well chosen and I believe that anyone can find at least one track that they find enjoyable. Personally, I found that I liked nearly all of the tracks, from ""Who Are You"" to ""Grissom's Overture"".The tracks transition nicely from upbeat rock songs into smooth ballad-style tunes.The strongest tracks--I believe--are ""Everybody Out of the Water (New Frontier),"" ""We Luv You,"" ""Unbound"" and the ""Investigation Suite,"" to name a few.The entire album, however, is very good."
5,I AM IN LOVE WITH IT,"I bought this item a month ago, and it had yet to leave my cd player. It had awesome songs on it! If you don't have it and you are in love with the show, BUY IT!! I LOVE IT!!!"
2,Mono reissue,"All tracks come in mono, which is rather strange for a reissue of albums that were originally released in 1976 and 1977."
2,AEM Intake good and bad,"Where do i start, 1st off the little help ""Does this fit your car vehicle ""from Amazon cannot be trusted this intake was way too short and Amazon claimed that it would fit my car. I did not want to go through the hassle of returning it and waiting for the right one or waiting to hear that they don't have one available for my vehicle since i had a hard time finding it online in the 1st place. Also there are a few pieces that where missing in the box (not really needed) so in all i ended up spending $9 on a gasket, and $10 on an extension tube then to find out it doesn't even come with an insert for the oxygen sensor, this I have to custom on my own. Over all it sounds and feels great! Love the noise it makes, just sounds meaner. Hope this helps!"
2,Recipes Oversimplified,"From the Lands of Figs and Olives: Over 300 Delicious and Unusual Recipes from the Middle East and North AfricaI was disappointed in some of the recipes included in this book. I have come to love and appreciate the nuances of the many spices used in North Africa and the Middle East. This book has ""oversimplified"" the spices to the point of making some of the recipes dull."
4,Good Watch,"Good watch, works well and came nicely and securely packaged. Already set to the right time and date. I bought this watch specifically for the moving bezel which I wish was a bit tighter- its is easy to move but because of that it tends to move a bit on its own too. The watch strap was also quite a bit to big for me but I have really small wrists so I don't think that is really a flaw in the watch."
4,great every day watch...,I like this watch because it is sturdy enough to wear to work everyday with out getting too thrashed on and it doesn't get the stinky smell that watches with a cloth/fabric band get. My complaint is that the face got really scratched up right away... I kept it from getting worse by putting a screen protector over it and that has lasted that way for many months. It is dressy enough to wear to a job interview (at least in Montana!) and casual enough to wear with jeans and a tshirt at work.
3,Sprayer doesnt spray!,The product works well but the pump doesn't spray I have had to remove the sprayer and pour it on my brush.
2,"OK for day-to-day driving, not for heavy brake use","I used this a few times during commute conditions and it did so-so, managing to loosen most of the dust as long as there wasn't too much, but after 2 days of spirited driving at Laguna Seca, it just couldn't handle it and I ended up having to resort to good-oleSimple Greenand a scrub brush. The initial application left large areas uncleaned, despite following instructions *and* having appliedGreen Earth Technologies Brake Dust ShieldAside from that, the fumes are toxic (coughing fit after spraying the last wheel) and 24oz don't really go that far - 3 applications tops.If I try some other product, I'm going to look into brush application rather than spraying (fewer fumes and more direct contact with the surface) but at the moment, a good bio-degradable all-purpose cleaner likeSimple GreenOh, and as for the brush, don't bother with theMothers Double Loop Brake Dust Brush- it just doesn't have the chops, see my review there for full details."
1,Beware,"This in not a sheet set or even multiple flat sheets. This is for A, as in one, flat sheet. The ad is very misleading by first showing a full sheet set as well as referring to the single item as ""sheets"", meaning more than one. Granted, it is an OK sheet. Buyer beware."
3,interesting piece,You'll have to solder it shut if you put anything in it and want to keep it. It's not well make and a little on the cheap side. Thankfully the person I bought it for was able to solder his shut.
3,an 80's comedy you've probably forgotten...,"PRINCESS ACADEMY is one of the lesser titles in the canon of 80's comedies (this one has dated rather more shockingly than most), nevertheless it's still quite an amusing romp. Eva Gabor leads the cast as the Countess Von Pupsin, head of the fashionable Von Pupsin Academy, which prides itself on educating the most well-bred of young ladies. Enter newcomer Cindy Cathcart (B-movie starlet Lar Park-Lincoln) the sole scholarship student who soon finds herself caught up with the other sex-starved students in trying to improve their extra-credit `activities'; in addition to overthrowing their evil and corrupt matron Fräulein Stinkenschmidt (Lu Leonard). As you can probably imagine, this movie won't challenge your mind. It's merely an entertaining little diversion which will really only be appreciated by it's faithful legion of 80s' kitsch fans (like myself). Originally rated R. Also featuring Richard Paul, Badar Howar and Carole Davis."
2,Lame even for an 8 year old,Even my 8 year old was bored with this. Are all the good jokes copyrighted? Absolutely bottom of the barrel material.
5,Discover Barbecue Essentials,"The DK 101 Essential Tips books are an excellent introduction to a wide variety of topics.

5,Putting it into words.,"I recently found out about this book and the term TCK. As an American who spent the majority of the first ten years of my life growing up in Scotland, it felt so comforting to find out that there is a whole community of people out there like me, and that our common experiences have a name. Also, as someone who never thought I'd read another ""textbook"" after graduating college, this book has definitely changed my mind. It's a great balance of expert language and personal story, perfect for TCKs or ATCKs just discovering who they are, non TCKs who share their lives with TCKs, parents of TCKs, and any educator or professional in an international setting. I consider this book to be the definitive publication on my life experience, and those like me."
3,BRAT culture search,"Still reading this RARE topical find. It is mostly about people who grew up as kids or ""brats"" around the world -- State Dept., etc. There are certainly big paralells, ideas that applied to us military people who grew up around the country and world. I'm still on the hunt for a modern day publication that addresses US specifically -- growing up on post/base, in the environment, with the military culture and then the cut away from it, the adjustment, the lack of support because we're ""used to be's"" for services but ""once a brat always a brat"" inside. It would be great, a God send, to find a resource such as this for which I am searching. Closest read I've found yet. BIRTH ARMY TO ARMY TO LOCAL NAT'L/MILITARY TO ARMY CIV TO AIR FORCE TO civilian non military: ""out here"". M. Donnan"
5,An important book to read in our world today,"We live in a world filled with third culture kids(tck), cross-culture kids(cck) and Adult third culture/cross culture kids(atck/acck) Children who have grown up in other countries and were adopted and moved to our country, children whose parents live and work in other countries for military,business, missionary and other jobs; children whose parents immigrated to the United States; children whose families are inter-racial or intercultural; children whose families are very mobile and move often; and the adults that they become. We expect these people to make decisions and fit into our culture like ""normal"" Americans, and they most often do not. They spend much of their lives trying to figure out where they fit in. This book is an interesting read for it illuminates our experience on campus, at work, in our homes and across society with many peole we encounter and even ourselves!"
4,Great first read,"I haven't finished it yet but till now it's been a great read! A true recommendation for anyone working with, raising or anyway differently involved with third culture kids. I myself find it very recognising and it makes me want to share this read. Thanks!"
5,Could help others too,"I was a Third Culture Kid and I found this book helpfull in understanding who I am 40 years later. (I found the TCK phrase awkward but could think of none better.)I also think this would be of use to people whose childhood was similar to the TCK's. Especially children who had little stability while growing up. Divorce, parential deaths, and especially children shunted off to boarding schools.Many boarding schools provide a fairly good life and a substitute family, but when it's over, it's over. and then who am I?"
5,A must-read,"This book is a well-written, clear and systematic treatment of what is surely a difficult theme, because everything pertaining to TCKs is so personal.I had several ""Aha"" moments while reading this book. In fact, I ended up re-reading and underlining several passages.Constantly being dislocated, constantly switching between educational systems and meeting all kinds of people impacts one more than one would care to imagine! A lot of it is definitely positive; there are some negative consequences, too.TCKs bear the unintended consequences of decisions made by our parents, by the organizations they worked for, and by a host of a lot of factors we simply cannot control -- but which impact us in unpredictable ways. I would strongly recommend this to those who have lived abroad during their developmental years."
3,a useful book,For patients and caregivers to get an overview of Parkinson's disease. It will help with immediate needs and future ones concerning this disease.
3,Visually unexciting,"Let me begin by stating that I really like Epica's music. I bought this DVD because I wanted to see a show, something that enhances the impact of the sound and imagination. I got the record of a bunch of people sitting in a studio, singing and playing musical instrument with minimal change in their facial expressions. I understand: they were working on the quality of the sound first and foremost and as a music lover I'm really grateful. The visual part just didn't come out all that exciting."
2,Pretty but...,"I bought this for my mama for Mother's day. She enjoys gardening and the little seat looked perfect in addition to the wooden handle tools. I assumed for the price that the shovels wouldn't bend and splinter during our first potting project. I'm not sure what exactly these tools would be better suited for as they didn't stand up well at all during our light gardening endeavor. It made me sad because I really thought this would be a quality set that I could confidently gift. I will say, however, it is a very pretty set. If the tools were better quality it would have been a home run mother's day gift. Lesson learned."
2,Cheap Tools,"The folding seat is nice, but my wife either bent or broke 3 of the 5 tools during the first weekend of use.Not worth the money, go to the box store and buy some good tools"
2,Great Bench | Terrible Tools,"I received this tool kit as a gift for Christmas from my awesome Mother-in-Law. We recently bought a home so she gave me this set to get my garden going. The first time I used it, I broke 2 of the tools within 5 minutes.. My soil was soft and as soon as I applied the tiniest bit of pressure to the shovel, it bent backwards.. A rather large weed proved to be the demise of the weeder tool which cracked in half. Overall, not thrilled. But the bench is really nice and I plan on replacing the tools with higher quality tools in the future."
4,Very Nice,I chose this as a Mother's Day gift.My mom loved it! The product is great and includes more than I expected!
4,nice,Well packaged and arrived safe and sound. It was a gift for my mom and she can't wait to use it in the spring!
2,Should have remain lost,"You get 12 songs:4 Live songs:WhiskeyKeepin' OnHard Livin'Another obscure new song live2 horrible instrumentals2 cover songs: Drift Away & Whisky Mama4 unreleased songs that sound exacly like Bob Seger's ""Turn the Page""I loved the Copperhead album, but this stinks. Hard to believe this is same band that did Busted, Scar and Lazy Day of Summer.Desperatly in need of a producer and a songwriter."
1,Buzz kill,"I had these headphones about a month, when the left earphone began buzzing. The buzz is less if the volume is low, as though me listening to it at high volume caused the damage. For the life of me, I can't imagine how or when such occurred. Also, the foam falls off about once a week, easily replacable, but not a sign of quality."
4,Quality Flax,"I'm not a flax expert, but this stuff was exactly what I needed. The taste was pretty good, and it worked perfectly to mix with my oatmeal in the morning. My only complaint was with the packaging. The resealable closure on the top did not reseal. No matter how many times I tried, it did not lock together. Frustrating, but easily solved with a real ziplock baggy."
5,Healthy,"This is a great way to add another healthy food to our diets, we even add it to our dogs food as well."
4,Concise and easy to read,"This book is packed full of helpful information for aspiring writers from all venues. Ms. Stuart covers everything, from good writing habits to organizing submissions. The information is concise and easily referenced. It's practical advice is not only helpful, but encouraging as well."
5,Love it!!,I purchased a set for myself for my college classes. I love them so much I have purchased a set for a friend of mine who is also going back to college. Thank you for such a great product!!
3,Le Creuset Oval Dish,"It's lovely, I'm keeping it. However, I thought it was going to be made of metal -- I bought it specifically to replace a 30+ year-old Le Creuset dish, similar in shape, but heavy iron based. I am a bit concerned this one may not make it for 30 years, since it can't be as durable, but it is what I needed -- and this one is microwave-safe!"
4,Casserole Dish,This casserole dish has some minor inconveniences. It's made of some sort of pottery so it cools down very slowly and it's easy to let something sit for 15 minutes and come back and burn your hand. I also learned through this dish that square casserole dishes are easier to cut brownies out of than round or oval ones. It does however cook things just fine and is not too large for what I need it for.
5,exactly what the kids wanted,"my godson wanted this toy and it was everything he thought it was. It is actually bigger than I thought it would be, but that was perfectly fine for him. It also arrived quickly, so I'm very happy with this seller."
1,SHALLOW HEROINE,"Natalie was shallow and after reading the entire book, I still cannot figure out why she had such a problem committing to David. I tried, but I just did not like her character."
1,A Waste of Paper,"This book is a shining example of a writer under contract. Whilst the story is modestly interesting (if a bit overblown), the story telling is spread thin, with details and story lines that simply vaporize later in the tale, leaving the attentive reader with more questions than answers.If it were not for pre arranged sales and promotions to ""education"" buyers, this thing (I can't really call it a story) would be a difficult to find footnote in the writers' career.Avoid this at all costs.J"
5,A Great Book!!!!!!!!!!,"My class is doing a novel study, and I picked this book! So far, from all of the books that I've read, this is probably my favorite one!Everyone Should read it. But it does put you in suspense alot!Have fun reading!"
3,Slow starter,"The premise of this book sounded very intruiging, but a slow start made the first half drag. Eventually it did get better and exciting."
5,Well-Done Stephens!,"This book includes a lot of ideas and concepts that extremely serve graphics programmers. I really found this book very useful, and it gave me new ideas that enhanced my way in programming. Besides it gives the reader full illustration for some problems in descriptive geometry and numerical analysis. REALLY Well-done Rod! Adel"
2,"If you plan to buy this book to get usable code, don't.","The graphics handling presented in the book takes no account of multiple color depths... only 256-color mode. There is no code presented to handle what we all face every day... a mixture of 256-color, 16-bit high color and 24-bit true color images. Even if you run in the required 256-color mode, many examples don't work properly. This book is a disappointment."
2,Great Book but you cannot use the work in a comercial App...,"The book does wonderful things. But,,, the typical purchaser buys the book to get help for an application, not light reading..."
4,Wheel and Tire Cleaner,"It works pretty well on my rims, getting them shiny and such. But, my rims are covered with a thick layer of grime on the edges and the center of the wheels. Its making this grime go away little by little with a bit of scrubbing in between sprays. So, it's definitely working, but I've almost gone through two bottles and not all the grime is off yet. It gets rid of dirt and break dust easy, bit I wish it was more potent to get this grime off!"
5,oopss,I bought this for my first vehicle not knowing my tires really don't even need it. but I gave it to a relative and it worked great on his wheels so it's 5 stars :
3,"works well, not easy to apply as aerosol","I used this product on my truck which has 18"" wheels and regular sized tires. I went through 3/4 of the bottle. The product was tough to apply because it sprays little, and in a stream rather than a lot in a spreaded area. I noted that the aerosol cans are much easier to apply. Mothers did an outstanding job cleaning my wheels and tires and the shine held after one rain. I give a two thumbs up if Mothers were to offer the product in a bottle which did a better job of efficiently spreading the product over the wheel area better. After the first spray I said 'are you kiddin me'."
3,works well - but application stinks and only 7 wheels out of one bottle,"this product does work, like all the rave reviews have said. What I don't like is it doesn't go a long way, so that's why 3 stars. I was only able to do 7 wheels (so I couldn't even finish 2 cars) and at the end I had to use a brush to get the last of the small stuff out. So doesn't completely work by itself just spraying off and doesn't go a long way"
2,Did not work as well as the Mothers All Wheel and Tire Mist,"This spray cleaner did not work as well as the mist product from Mothers' I have both and tried each on two wheels/tires. The mist spray worked better. Noticed the product info has an additional ingredient which might be the reason. I will be buying the mist spray again, not this one."
1,Not Worth It,I'm not impressed with this at all. Picked it up on sale at a local auto parts store so figure I'd give it a try. I followed the instructions and even tried to use it a second time on each tire/wheel and the wheels still looked terrible. I couldn't believe how much was actually required to cover the entire wheel and tire. There is probably enough in the 24oz bottle to cover 10 tires. You are better off saving your money and using your regular car wash soap with a brush or microfiber to get the same result. Save your cash and look elsewhere.
2,Not What It Claims To Be,"An average wheel cleaner, but in no way just spray and wash off. This requires brush scrubbing just like other wheel cleaners. After two applications per wheel the wheels still had about 80% of the original brake dust still on the surface. After using a brush, the wheel was just as clean as one application of my usual less expensive wheel cleaner with a brush. The advertising of spray on and wash off is misleading. I would not buy this again."
1,"Foam and rinse, yes, there goes your clearcoated wheels!","Says it's safe for every type of wheel......sprayed it on, one wheel at a time, gave it 20-30 seconds to work, as instructed, no brushing (yay!), and rinsed completely. My wheels were shiny and clean, but they looked a different color; they were a champagne-colored silver, now they're SILVER! Man, I am pissed off! Tried a little on my bicycle wheel.....rinsed it off, let it dry and they are now pitted and ugly. BEWARE of this product! Should have known it would be a disaster when my hands started burning when I accidentally sprayed them. RUINED MY NEW WHEELS!"
2,DANGER Will Robinson: This may take the clear coat off your rims if you leave it on too long!,"My truck is pretty old ('97), and I have chrome rims.. Got this stuff to give them a good cleaning from all the brake dust that accumulates! Well I sprayed one side, then sprayed the other side (instructions say leave on for 30 seconds) and it could not have been more than a minute before I hosed it off! Well the side where it was on the longest looks completely dull now, almost just like gray spray paint! My guess is that it took some kind of clear coat off the chrome rims! So be careful with this stuff!!!"
2,Mothers Wheel & Tire Cleaner,"Does good job, but to expensive for the number of tires & wheels it cleans. You have to cover all the wheel and tire to get a good job. I only cleaned 8 tires and wheels before the container was empty."
1,Save Your Hard-Earned Money,"""Mothers"" used to have a good rep. for car detailing. This wheel and tire cleaner seemed efficient so I ordered a spray bottle. Listen now, it took a full bottle to clean my wheels & tires. And it ran out on the 4th tire. A full 24 oz. bottle for 1 application. It also left streaks and some leftover gunk on the wheels. My car is a normal 2004 Infiniti coupe w/18"" factory wheels and brand new Michelin tires. Amazing and disappointing! I actually had to finish the job with my regular detailing products. I recommend saving your hard-earned money for a class product like Zymol. Griot's is also cost-effective doing the same tasks."
3,Deceptive title,"The book cover makes one think this is about the Shaq-Kobe feud - and it covers it - but it mostly goes over the history of the organization from it's days in Minneapolis to their eventual move to Los Angeles. I came off thinking Heisler was originally writing a book just about the Lakers history but rushed it out to meet the Kobe-Shaq headlines. It's a good read for a Lakers fan or die-hard NBA fans. If you're looking for anything in-depth about Laker figures such as Kobe, Shaq, or Magic Johnson, I would advise you to look elsewhere but if you want an overview of the Lakers' successful history, this is your book."
3,Great Book... but not really.,"I found that the stories Mark Heisler has in this book are fantastic. He obviously knows the Lakers. I love the Lakers, and so I loved this book. Or did I? As a researcher, he's top-notch. As a sports writer, again top-notch. But in book form? Someone should have stopped him. His remarkable ability to run-on sentences and under-punctuate is beyond distracting. And the typos... hundreds, no lie. Triumph Publishing should really be ashamed of itself. That having been said, I did enjoy the read in spite of the author's shortcomings and the lack of an editor. This probably has more to do with the Lakers themselves than anything else."
3,"Mistakes, mistakes, mistakes...","I enjoyed some of the inside stuff, but the number of errors is staggering. The most egregious can be found on Page 32, where we have the following line -- ""It (the season) was further disrupted by the punch Kermit Alexander threw that caved in Rudy Tomjanovich's face as the Lakers dropped to 45-37.""Kermit Alexander? As even casual fans know, it was Kermit Washington who threw the punch that almost killed Tomjanovich. While you may wink at the many, many errors -- both factual and typographical -- in this book, one of this magnitude is impossible to excuse."
3,AN OK READ,"THIS IS ABOUT THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS. THE BOOK GIVES US A LOOK AT MANY OF THE PLAYERS, COACHES AND OWNERS WHO HELPED MAKE THIS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISE IN RECENT HISTORY. SOME OF THE STORIES ARE VERY INTERESTING AND WELL WRITTEN. BUT SOME ARE JUST SAME OLD SAME OLD. I LIKED READING ABOUT ELGIN BAYLOR, WILT AND JERRY WEST OF THE EARLY 70'S TEAMS AND THE LAKERS OF THE 80'S WITH MAGIC AND KAREEM. BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE LAKERS OF THE 2000'S IT WAS THE SAME OLD STUFF. IF YOU LIKE THE LAKERS THEN IT IS WORTH A LOOK."
4,"Make No Mistake: ""Oops, Pig!"" is a winner!","While my two year old has never seen the movie, Babe has come to life for her in this darling little story! Shana Corey has crafted a simple, day-in-the-life story of America's favorite little sheep pig who's always trying to help with the chores around the farm, only to get himself into one silly mess after another! It's a fun, easy read, and I'm sure this will be one of the first books our little one learns to read on her own.Pleasing artwork and plenty of farm animals make for fun reading and diversions into sound effects from mom, dad, and even our child! My only regret is that the story could've been a few pages longer, and the opening ""Quack-a-doodle-doo"" by the duck could be confusing to younger children who are learning to distinguish animals."
1,Awful,"Twice they never sent me correct book. Still waiting two weeks for the next attempt. Not reliable, very disappointed, not recommend"
5,Simply Outstanding!!!,"I have read all of Peter's works. Of all his works I find the power of his characters and future vision exceptionally outstanding in The Nano Flower. This book in particular is among the best of the best of contemporary speculative fiction. He is my favorite and this book epitomizes and validates my opinion. I generally am attracted to men like Greg,and I am in this series. However, this book entices me with an equally attractive powerful visionary woman, Julia Evans! I just read this in August of 2012 and mistakenly thought it was new! His political commentary and technologies are current and provocative. I could dream that these series could become films of epic proportions! Simply great!"
2,Disappointing finish,"Sorry, but I didn't care for it. The ending was a disappointment. I expected better after 480 pages. The book seems to be nothing more than a vehicle for Hamilton to dazzle us with his science and engineering knowledge. The truth is that his storytelling is just not that good here."
5,Wayne King the Waltz king-awesome,"Hello, I bought this to replace an old copy at the nursing home and it is wonderful. Plays beautifully, received promptly in good condition.Thank you."
3,Some Quality Material,"Whereas this recording is not one the same level as Let It Roll or Representing The Mambo, there plenty of snappy tunes that will get your toes tapping. Spiders Blues and Clowning have spunky rhythms that will catch your listening ear and have you saying,""Thats pretty grooving material"". Mojo Haiku and Loved and Lied To feature some strong vocals by Craig Fuller. Whereas Shaun Murphy was an excellent replacement, Craig added alot to the Little Feat sound when he was on board. This collection has a nice balance of songs. I rate it 3 1/2 stars to distinguish it from the ordinary three stars in my previous reviews."
1,The worst of the new Little Feat recordings.,"I was a huge Little Feat fan and appreciated all of their later life recordings until this one. It marked the end of their collaborations with Craig Fuller and was a lyrical disaster. Boom Box Car is the most out of touch song I had ever heard at that point in my life.It's almost rude to trash on Little Feat. I love them as a band, but this record was awful."
4,Everybody can use a little Le Creuset,I purchased this little pot as a gift for a friend.Something to hold all the kitchen utencils that we all use each day. Being a chef I know that I can rely on Le Creuset. And this small pot is no diffrent. I was so fond of it I have bought my self two for my own kitchen. Knowing that it can stand up to heat. I have it next to the stove. I say try it in you kitchen. My only request is that they shoud come in a set.
3,Looks Nice,This product is more for show than for use. It is too small for the kids strangely large toothbrushes.
1,"Poor quality, arrived broken, and only got worse","First off, the pillow radio thing arrived in broken pieces... it wasn't why I bought this so I let it go.THe hammock, even at my weight of 110 pounds has my rear end hitting the metal bars underneath. In other words it stretches, and there is no way to tighten it so I can use it. Poor quality, poor design, and all out not worth a penny!"
1,JUNK...Almost broke my arm and others things....,"Easy to setup. But, as soon as you lay on it, it flips over. The price was good."
2,Not portable! Broken!!,"I had bad luck with this product. I bought it because it said it was being shipped from amazon and I always love their items. Well the hammaock they sent me was one that someone else had returned because it had a hand written return tracking number on it, and there was grass and dirt in it when I opened it. And the pillow was a mess! It wouldnt turn on, and all of the hard plastic pieces were broken off. I returned the item to get a new one, and again the pillow was broken! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!! So the second hammock I kept, but it is not portable. It takes like 20 min to get the pins in place so it doesnt collapse when you lay on it. When the item is in the bag it sticks out the top!!"
2,A Little Stiff,"I love hammocks, so I was excited to see there was a portable one that I could buy that would fit in on my deck without a huge stand. I like the compact nature of the product, and I like the way it unfolds and falls into place. However, I found it a bit uncomfortable, once stretched into place, it felt like it created a center line down the middle of the fabric. The pillow has to be blown up manually by mouth, so it is difficult to expand, and I gave up. Also, half of the radio control buttons fell off. I won't use the pillow at all, but I will continue to use the hammock camping or on certain occasions, but probably not regularly. Overall, it is a hammock good for camping or for kids. The size would be too small for anyone tall, especially men. Overall, its just OK."
2,Ok If you like sitting on the ground,"I was really disappointed in this one. First off, since it was advertised as portable I thought it would be much lighter to carry, it's not convenient for me to lug around at all.One of the major reasons I bought this was because I was excited about the cup holder and magazine holder but when you sit on it, you are pretty much on the ground (your tush is maybe an inch of the ground) so the cup holders are pointless since you can just put your cup right on the ground. Nobody sits on this thing, I can see it being nice on the beach to keep you off the sand but it's too heavy to lug there. Would not recommend."
2,Low to the ground,"I ended up returning this product because it was way too low to the ground. Myself and others who tried it out could feel the bars underneath your bottom that support the hammock so you couldn't ""sway"" back and forth easily."
3,mediocre,This concept is a great idea but the biggest pet peeve is that the hammock sags to the ground when it is wet or on the beach. I am only 150lbs and I should be the last to have the sort of problem. It still functions correctly for the most part.
1,Not great.,"For the money I spent on this bra it should be a better bra all around. It gives a classic ""torpedo"" shape to the breasts, does not offer any lift, and is pretty much unwearable."
4,Wonderbra really does wonders!!,As funny as it sounds my mother recommended this bra to me and when i got it i thanked her for it. it is so comfortable and really does a great job of giving me the look and feel i look for in an enhancer bra.it was versatile also; it could be a strapless bra also with removable straps.the price was great too.worth every dollar and will leave some dollars in your pocket too unlike a lot of other enhancer bras. it wasnt over the top but gave me a little extra that i wasn't blessed to be born with. it comes in different colors so i plan on buying another one. i would recommend it to anyone looking for something that works and feels good. just make sure to take care of the straps.if you are two rough on where they attach you can lose your strapped option.
4,pretty cool,"i love everything about this except that i believe it runs slightly big, it tends to slip a bit when i use it strapless, but then again what else can you expect from strapless lol."
2,saggy,I bought these for my wife. She complains about them. The bra keeps slipping down and she has to keep tugging at it to bring them up to normal level.Simply not that good.
4,wonderbra,"fits, seems sturdy, needs to come with a guide as to the specific ways the straps can be used (aside from the conventional)"
5,Great cutting board!,"I keep this on my counter all the time, I love the shape of it (that is why I bought it!) turns out to be a very well made product! The manufacture is very reputable and would buy any of their products!"
3,great book,"I'm so glad to have this book. I create cards all the time, and often struggle to find amazing words. This book has been a tremendous help."
3,Ultimate Guide to Perfect Card,"Book was in excellent condition, came quickly. Selection of sayings will be useful for my card making. 30% I might have already had/heard of/were to lame. So 70% is pretty good."
3,Ultimate? Perhaps not...,"I had high hopes for this book and was excited when I finally received it. It's really not the ""ultimate"" guide though. First of all, the font used in the book is along the lines of childlike print and gets annoying after several pages. In addition, the author has several, numerous quotes of HERSELF and a lot of the others are from her friends. I found that to be pretty cheesy. I think some of the quotes and expressions might be useful, but not nearly as helpful as I had hoped."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I was really disappointed when I received this book. I had waited in anxious anticipation for weeks, but I quickly realized The Ultimate Guide to the Perfect Card wasn't what I'd been expecting. The book would be more effectivly marketed as a religious card book. Almost every poem or sentiment is somewhat religiously oriented. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but nowhere does the book review mention this fact.The poetry is very simplistic, almost child-like, and the meter doesn't always match. Some of the entries are also inappropriate. I would be offended if someone sent me a sympathy card that said, ""Do not fret or mourn"" after my child died.The best parts of this book are the short ""one-liners"" at the beginning of each section. I would recommend The Ultimate Guide to the Perfect Word because it features more of these one-liners to inspire a crafter's creativity."
2,The Ultimate Guide to the Perfect Card,"I was not pleased with the card says. As bas as I am with sayings, I think I can come up with better ones than these. Sorry!"
1,P.U. This stinks!,"I would think these guys hated the music of muddy waters & Hendrix by hearing this example of their work. There is nothing inventive here, just NOISE! It`s live,& I guess recorded in a bar.Maybe if you get yourself REAL POLLUTED it will appeal? If you must have a tribute CD of Hendrix, try the ""beautiful people""~""if 60`s were 90`s"". You might hate this too, but at least it`s inventive. Better yet, just stick to the real thing."
1,false advertising,"Although the ""technical data"" said this pot is safe for the stovetop, when it arrived, its own literature said very clearly that it is NOT safe for stovetop use. The only reason I ordered it was because I wanted something I could move from stovetop to oven or broiler. THis is very disappointing."
4,Smooth jazz,"Great electro jazz, sophisticated vocals by C. Stalin and Y. Nagano, i find some tracks not as good as others"
5,Pivot mode is the huge advantage,* This monitor is so insanely great.. I bought it last October with my G5 Dual tower because of a recommendation in MacWorld. I always have it turned in portrait mode because web pages are vertical. Apple Cinema displays don't have this essential feature yet.
3,Been Mobbed,"The songs on the album are great. However, the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. The Mob's cover of Mama Said Knock you out is hard hitting and in your face. This band was one of the best kept secrets in Rock n Roll. Their debut album ""omerta"" is one for any funk and alternative rock n roll lover's collection. I've seen this band in local clubs more times than I can count and have never been let down. It's too bad they are no longer together."
2,The worst album then ever did,"Spin the World and Omerta are the albums you should be buying. But apparently they are out of print. And frankly, it a tragedy. This was a fabulous band. And perhaps even more fun live (Harold we miss you...come back...or at least get Spin the world re-released)"
5,DELISH,"THESE GINGER SNAPS ARE EXTEMELY DELISHIOUS.I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE WHEAT-FREE, GLUTEN-FREE, AND DAIRY-FREE INGREDIENTS. GOTTA TRY 'EM!!"
5,Grace Unfolding,This book is a very simple and beautiful book that captures the essence of what is perhaps most important to pay attention to in doing and being in psychotherapy(and in life for that matter). This is a gem of a book and I recommend it to therapist and layperson alike.
3,Origami,"It's a refreshing book, and easy to pick up and browse through at any time.By its very nature, it's very loose - I would like a more cohesive book as I like travelling from A to B to C rather than a book being so spacious it seems to lack direction.The hints it offers are useful"
1,Atmospheric,"I found the advice to be vague and impractical. It reads more like poetry than psychotherapy. The Tao is, however, a lovely piece of Eastern philosophy, and nicely translated in this volume."
5,Great first pop-up for toddlers!,"Little Red Car Gets into Trouble was the perfect first pop-up book for our 18-month old son. It's sturdily contructed, with pull-tabs that are easy for a first-timer to manipulate. We've found that the pull-tabs for most pop-up books may seem simple for us, but often require actions that are confusing or difficult for a very young toddler (pushing tabs left to right and back is suprisingly difficult for young toddlers who don't have good three dimensional hand control yet). In Little Red Car, all actions are so simple and well-marked that our son could do them on his own after the first try. Plus, it has a dump truck, a loader, and a stop light."
5,From 4 years and up!,"I had seen the Dutch version at my son's crèche and he had great fun with it. However in an unsupervised moment, he showed how much he liked the little red car by pulling all the little red cars out of the book and playing with them on the floor.Same as for the Fire Engine to the Rescue.Not sturdy enough.I will get another one in a year if he has learned not to rip the popups out of his books."
4,Develops deliberately and intriguingly,"This splendid novel rings especially true with this aging reviewer, who finds himself ever more likely to seek clues to the significance of current events and personalities in his recollections of the past. And of course, Thomas Railles, being the artist he is, has a facility for especially vivid recollections of his late wife and friends, as well as the two hometown pals currently bedeviling him.The book is not the best choice for those who favor slam-bang action, with the protagonists zipping about the world in pursuit of whatever it is, followed by a dramatic shootout to wrap up all loose ends. Those sorts of books are fun, but not what this is by any means."
1,Can I give negative stars?,"BORING. Why is plotless stream of connciousness so often mistaken for art? This book could be used to cure insomnia, unless of course wasting your life with drivel causes anger.If a book is going to be nothing other than one or two characters blithering and whining, it might be a good idea to give the reader a reason to care."
3,Not One of Just's Best,"Ward Just might be the greatest living American writer. However, this is not one of his best books (more specifically, it is not in the same class as ""Unfinished Season"" or ""Echo House""). Where in his other books, the character's introspection and reflections on the past lead to a fuller understanding of life, the protagonist's musings in this book seem self-absorbed and disconnected."
3,Opaque; understanding loss in the post 9/11 world,"All hope and expectation from the protagonist artist derives, as usual in Just's novels, from the idealistic halcyon days of John F. Kennedy. Some writers are tethered to those times. Just is one. There are few climatic scenes in this meditative, well written short novel about aging after the death of a loved one. The scene settings in the Pyrenees, Le Havre and the coast of Maine are enjoyable and beautifully descriptive, the dialogue adequate but those looking for some coup de main look elsewhere. All ends with a rambling whimper."
3,hide an seek,"Ward Just is a wonderful writer. The first part of this, his latest book, promises the reader his usual balance of intrigue, skilful storytelling and silken prose. Disappointingly, it falls apart. It's as if he ran out of ideas about his characters. When stuck they manage to drink (in detail), smoke, in detail, and never quite get a female character to be believable. He does create mini stories within the structure of the book that captures the reader, but then he seems to run out of gas. Perhaps he lost interest, I know I did."
1,Overrated,"Seems like the other half of the story is still hidden in the authors head. Very awkward writing style, hard to read, and stay engaged."
1,"I thought 'timing component' meant you get all seals involved, stupid me.","Last I checked 'timing component' implies that you get all seals involved with changing the timing belt. Nope, I only got one. Weak."
2,his music video sucks!!!,"i just watched the music video for ""spark"" on launch.yahoo.com and it is probably the gayest video i've ever seen, more gay than any culture club videos, it's that gay!!! u can tell he's gay but in the video he lusts for these 2 girls which we all know is fake. he's gotta cheezy smile too. his dancing also sucks!!!"
5,best soy sauce ever,"I'm using this brand for years for stir-frying. It'll give to your vegetable nice softness. It's very tasty, thick and has amazingly only 2% of sodium !!! This is sweet version , very sweet. I'm mostly using unsweetened Kwong BLACK Soy Sauce , it's the best on market in Chicagland. Unsweetened one has little more of sodium (15%), which is still very low amount and it is very thick too, so you don't have to use a lot of it. They selling these bottles here in our stores for only $1.99-$2.99 range ."
5,Patriots: Read This and Weep!,"Americans are being deceived. In this stunning piece of investigative reporting which should be awarded a Pulitzer Prize, Juan Gonzalez reveals the horrible truths about the environmental impacts of the 9-11 disaster. Asbestos abounded. The many heroes who helped to clean and console may face excruciating deaths thanks to suppressed and inaccurate information.Our sacred institutions are rotten. Every American citizen should read this brief but incendiary work which speaks truth to power unflinchingly. If we do not quickly institute major changes which make our leaders and representatives truly responsible for telling the truth to the American public, however unpleasant, we may be facing the end of American democracy as we have known it and believed in it.Where are the Thomas Paines and Thomas Jeffersons of the twenty-first century? We desperately need your voices and leadership!"
2,does not fit the lowest size bike,"I bought two Bell bike standers. One says it fits bike from 16"". And my son's 16"" bike stands upright, easily fall to the other side. Today, I bought one for my other son's 12"" bike. The stands fits bike 12"" to 26"". And again, it turns out too long for 12"" bike. It fits my son's 16"" bike very well."
4,"Good format/shape, but the screw is too short.","This kickstand is solidly built and should fit the great majority of bikes. The height adjustment works simply and flexibly. The installation was a little problematic for me, however.The bike I bought this kickstand for is a kids' model from Walmart. It actually has a small plate at the rear horizontal frame fork. This is exactly where the kickstand should be attached and I suspect that the maker of the bike planned to include a kickstand in the first place if Walmart had chosen to do so. The installation therefore would have been straightforward if the crew that came with the kickstand had not been 1/2 inch too short. Fortunately, I found a spare screw in my garage that is of the right size. This saved a trip to Home Depot."
5,Awesome Kickstand,"Purchased for a bike that did not have kickstand. Great adjust-ability and easy install. Needs some oiling at first, since a little stiff. My 5 year old writes, ""I like the kickstand on my bike. I like my bike a lot."""
1,Doesn't Fit My Bike,"I have a regular bike and I tried installing this kickstand as indicated but it doesn't fit my bike. There is not enough clearance between the pedals and where the kickstand folds back so that, when installed, the pedals end up getting blocked by the kickstand. Very disappointing as there is no indication anywhere in the product description that you need a specific distance between your pedals and the chasis of your bike. I will need to buy a kickstand that attaches to the part of the chasis that comes out towards the back wheel."
3,serves it's purpose,"Kick stand serves it's purpose. I bought it for my daughter's bike that came with training wheels but no kick stand. I didn't think about the whole kick stand thing until we removed the training wheels. I like how it is adjustable for different bikes however it is very hard to ""kick"" down for a child. My child hardly ever uses it and it appears to have been a waste of money so far for us."
2,Arm comes down while riding,"It didn't seem like there were many options out there for a 12"" bike, so I tried this one. The kickstand was fine to install and did work on the 12"" bike, but after about 3 weeks of use the kickstand arm started falling down while riding. At this point the kickstand arm won't stay retracted so we just use a twist-tie to keep the arm retracted...until I can find another one to buy."
4,Versatile and Stabile,"Bought this for my son's 16"" bicycle. Came complete with all the needed hardware. All I needed was a screwdriver. Was out of the package and on the bike in 2 minutes. My son (4) can easily place the kickstand up or down with his foot. A good buy."
3,"For a 12"" bike?","It was very difficult for me to find a kickstand for my daughter's 12 inch bike, so I was happy to find this Bell adjustable height kickstand.It was easy to install. Unlike my son's kickstand, which installed near the back wheel, this one goes on the frame right behind the pedal.The height adjusts by pulling the sleeve of the kickstand to the desired length and pinning it with a screw. At the shortest length, the kickstand was too long.I ended up taking the sleeve off and that worked. I just don't have a rubber cap to go on the end of the kickstand.The kickstand is very stiff. I hope it loosens with time. Right now, my daughter cannot use it herself. I have to help her.Still, I'm glad the bike is no longer laying on the ground."
5,Fits Perfect - Easy Install,"I bought two of these for a 12"" and 16"" bike. Both installs were done in under 10 minutes with only an adjustable wrench. They are a little stiff at first, difficult for a child to operate, but after some use they get easier."
1,Bell kickstand is junk-Buy a Greenfield instead for the same price,"I bought this for my daughter's 12"" first bicycle. Yes, it keeps the bike up, but a 5 year old will not be able to put this kickstand up or down. By a Greenfield instead and cut to length. MUCH better kickstand. I have been using Greenfield kickstands for years. Stable and very easy to put up or down."
2,"great kick stand, doesn't work on 12 inch- said it did","I needed a kick stand to work on my son's 12 inch bike, the description said it would work on a 12 inch, and it does not."
1,Poor quality - broke after 2 months,"This item lasted about 2 months on my daughter's bike before it broke. Specifically the pin upon which the kickstand leg rotates bent slightly, rendering the entire kickstand useless. It feels solid and heavy 'out of the box' but its quality dooms it to failure. Suggest you look somewhere else."
3,"poor fit and not easy install, but works now.","The product did not have sufficient adjustment to properly fit my Electra Hawaii 16"" bike. It was too long, so I had to remove the outer tube and just use the inner shaft. The rubber foot does not fit the inner shaft.This bike also had a mounting plate for a kick stand that the Bell Stand did not fit into. It took some metal bending to get it to work."
4,Does its job well,"I had to get a new kickstand after my OEM kickstand bent out of shape too badly to be repaired again. I bought this one and decided to try it out. It did install well. One of the pros I found is that it actually made my bike stand straighter than the OEM did when it was new. The original one always caused my bike to sag a little too much, and that's probably why it bent---too much strain. The only small quirk I had about this stand is that it sits too flush with the bike frame when it is the retracted position. I wasn't able to kick it in the down position when I reached back with my foot, but I easily fixed it by bending the kickstand rod outward a little (don't try this when it is installed, put it in a vice), and now it works fine. The adjustable link makes custom-fitting easy for any size bike, and it doesn't seem like it is going to break. All in all, I am very satisfied and would recommend it."
4,fit nicely,"This went on my daughter's 16 inch bike really easily, I actually had to extend it two notches. Nice quality, the telescoping tube could be a tighter fit, but no reason to give a poor review, because once you tighten down the screw there's no movement. I did put some loctite on the screw because it was pretty short and I could see it coming out with some use."
5,It fits!,"I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't fit the 12"" bike I was buying, given conflicting reviews here. But it did, just perfectly! Installation was easy and there's growing room for future bikes. It is, as some others mentioned, very stiff at first, but that seems to be easing up somewhat and hopefully will disappear over (a short) time."
2,Flimsy & Barely Functional,"The connecting bracket is sturdy enough and easy to install. The stand itself consists of a flimsy tube with a flimsier, poorly fitting extension secured by only one set screw. Even at full length it does not quite extend far enough for an adult size bike, and bends a little as it takes the weight of the bike. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before someone leans on the bike and bends the stand beyond use.I think it would be sufficient for a very small child-size bike which did not require any extension, but this is not for larger or heavier bikes."
4,Still standing,"Great bike stand for my six year old's bike! Solid construction, easy to attach, and adjusts for various sizes. I would recommend to anyone tired of tripping over small bikes in their garage."
1,"Does not work on our 14"" and 18"" bicycles","This kickstand did not install on either of my kids' bicycles - one is 18"" and the other 14"". It was too long on the shortest setting, and the design of how to install it does not fit with the frame shape of either bicycle. Very disappointed! It is also very stiff. WD40 helped some, but I doubt my 5.5 year old would be able to use the kickstand on her own even after the WD40."
1,Cheap and Worthless,"My bike is tall-framed (26 in wheels, 20 in frame). The extendable kick stand was adequate in length but could have benefited from being longer because using it still resulted in occasional tip-overs. A better angle could have also been nice, it was too vertical to provide much support. The washer on the bolt broke in half in less than 2 weeks resulting in a loose stand. Within a month the extendable shaft required frequent tightening of its screw, starting once every few days, and now so bad I can't even use it. The loose stand from the lack of a washer and a loose shaft screw combined to make the end interrupt the movement of the spokes on my back wheel. Overall, very poor quality. I advise spending a couple more dollars on something else."
4,quick and easy,"Why do you sell a kids bike without a bike stand, i don't know. But at least this part was cheap and easy to add on."
4,Perfect for Open House!,These posters work great if used in conjunction with open house. Kids love filling them out and parents love reading their child's. A wonderful writing prompt!
5,Love these!,These are a great tool for students grades 1-3! I love that my students create their own Star of the Week posters without going overboard. These are perfect!
5,Star Student,I use these posters for my weekly Star Students. They love them! I display them in the classroom while they are star student. Very happy with them!!!
5,Intro For Students,"This is a great product to send home at the beginning of the year with your students and have them work on it at home with their family and then bring it back to school to be displayed, say, for an open house. Good product."
5,Provenal poetry cornerstone,"Giraut de Bornelh is certainly one of the most important Provencal troubadours and a cornerstone of European poetry, being much imitated, among the others, by the Dolce Stil Novo and Petrarca. This edition covers all his work with extreme philological accuracy, and is a must-have for all interested in formal poetry. The format, though, is a bit distressing, and the fact that no quote (aside from Giraut's songs) is translated, makes it a bit of an awkward, though enticing, reading. An exhaustive introduction and accurate notes are provided."
5,Excellent intro to VHDL,"This book is exactly what it says it is: a VHDL Staters Guide. It is a great way to get started in VHDL, i'm finding this book clearly written, useful and interesting. This book has an emphisis on SIMULATION of VHDL, instead of SYTHESIS. This means that you don't need any silicon to start learning VHDL. However you will probably want another book on VHDL Systhesis as well, as you might want more in-depth information about sythesis. However this book is a great starting point, and clearly explains the syntax of VHDL and how to use it properly. VHDL is such a huge and powerful area that one 265 page book won't explain everything, but is a great way to begin!"
4,good but lacking,It is a good introduction to the VHDL language and VHDL simulation. I was disapointed with the lack synthesis discussion: how the different VHDL constructs can effect gate count and timing.
5,A great little teaser before the release of Warrior Soul,"Every molecule that makes up Doro Pesch rocks. You either know that, or you have never heard of her. In America she should be huge! Doro released this album for her fans before they had a chance to sink their teeth into Warrior Soul.In Liebe und Freundschaft - An awesome ballad that appears on Warrior SoulFor Love and Friendship [English Version]- The same song in English, just as awesomeNever Get out of This World Alive - Not her best song, but you can sing along to it.Lonely Wolf - This song grew on me. After a few listens I really dug it.All We Are [Multimedia Track] Film footage of Doro performing at Germany's Wakken Metal Festival. Doro is complete control of a huge crowd. She looks great and sings one of her best loved songs."
3,Good stuff.,"I liked one song before buying it, and was expecting others to be as good. It wasn't the case, there are about 3 or 4 that were great, the rest, not really my style."
2,Bit Dissapointed,"Not quite what I expected. Being a full blown book on the subject, it is short on recipes. There are more tips and recipes on the internet and YouTube!"
3,Not really worth the money,"It's a nice book, but not really worth money, most of the recipes can easily be found online. The book is pretty high quality in terms of build though."
2,Metric recipes don't work so well in the US,"Some of the recipes in this book sound interesting. But the first thing I noticed is that the recipes are metric. If you're in the US, and you really want to try these recipes, be prepared to buy metric measuring cups. In addition, there are unfamiliar terms used in the preparation instructions, so be prepared to use the internet to search for definitions. Overall, I wouldn't bother buying this book. I haven't decided whether to return it to Amazon or not."
1,Quality of book is bad!,"I searched online for a book with Espuma recipes and this seemed like it would be a good buy for the price. However, when I got it I found it to be very flimsy and written only for people who are a novice at espuma making. It's a cheap 3 ring binder with thin pages which will break after flipping through the pages a few times. I'm very disappointed. You can find many of the recipes on the ISI website. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"
1,Half the book?!?!?!,"I opened the book to a recipe, not a welcome page or index. It actually looks like half the book is gone. I am going to order the same book from iSi or another vendor to see what is up then update this comment. I definitely do not understand why the recipes are out of order. Instantly debated sending it back, and probably will."
1,kenneth cole KC1350 Really poor Mechanism,"I bought this kenneth cole watch KC1350 and after few months it started giving wrong time. I bought cheaper watches than this and all stayed for a long time. Although the looks and the feel of this watch is really great. As a courtesy and to stay behind their name, Kenneth cole should replace these watches or fix them at no cost."
2,Meh,"I bought this watch about 1 year ago. Today the 11 o'clock marker separated from the face and is now rattling around inside. There is no explanation for this as I don't abuse my watches and take very good care of them. The only thing I can think of is bad design and/or wrong glue. Watches should last a long time, but I guess this is pretty inexpensive for a watch and you get what you pay for. It's very stylish though, which is why I didn't give it 1 star."
4,rocks my face off!,"Brass hula-hoops for time machines, a bowling ball as a futuristic communication device and a space monster in a surf rock band, Citizen Kane this ain't. It's a low budget love letter to schlocky cult cinema, it's fun and entertaining with decent pacing and hot girls in form fitting out fits. Roll a joint, order a pizza and laugh your ass off!"
5,Great resource for learners of French!,"This is a great resource if you are at or beyond the intermediate level, and wonder --- what now? The book has loads of fascinating information on the French language (in English) and the complete text of the 4 cassettes (with facing-page translation). The material has information on French history, literature, regions, dialects, food, etc."
2,Shame on Amazon..,Here's how it is folks. I ordered this awhile ago and won't get it because...I got it on the free shipping. I truly believe Amazon sends paid shipping orders FIRST...THEN...if there is anything left in stock...the people who ordered enough in the required $$ amount so that they got free shipping (and gave Amazon good business) get THEIRS. We HAVE to be last on the priority list because this has happened over and OVER to me on orders where I've gotten the free shipping. They've taken MONTHS to come!! I'd rate this item higher if I could actually TRY it but if you truly want a popular item such as this..pay for your shipping. That's all I have to say. I guess I'll continue to wait (now impatiently) for my little crock to come.:(
2,Waste of money,"I found this book to be just a rehash of what I've read elsewhere. If you are looking for answers, try Health Sleep Habits, Happy Child, this book actually helped me with my baby."
1,Nothing new,"I was hoping this book would help us all get a better nights sleep, but it's the same old ""cry it out"" method we've all heard about. Not our style."
1,Another cry it out to sleep book,"I thought I'd find more logical techniques for sleep from Dr Brazelton since I enjoy all his other books, but this book just follows the old-school cry it out method. I did find many non-crying solutions in a newer book called the No Cry Sleep Solution."
5,All I needed to know,"This is a great little book - short, easy to use, not overwhelming. Yet I've found all the answers to my questions in it, simply and clearly explained. I especially like the section with all the suggestions on how to handle problems. I'm done with struggling over bedtime with my 3 year old. This book has shown me what to do and given me the confidence to do it."
2,Not recommended!!!,"I purchased this book because at first glance it appeared to be divided into different age levels with advice for each. Not the case, for some ages there was advice and for others there was information about typical behavior for that age level but it didn't say how to use that information. It is not a helpful book for anyone who is looking to help their child develop good sleep habits."
5,Very useful !!,"While I didn't really enjoy UML Toolkit I do enjoy this book. The presentation and writing styles are same between books however, which are very structured and easy to follow however.This book does a wonderful job of discussing the ""design patterns"" around the activities of a business, this is it's strength. While I haven't yet mapped these out in UML to a business I think they can stand on their own outside of UML. UML just makes the flow more understandable.Overall the design patterns are enough to recommend it. Very novel and useful!"
2,Not particularly useful,"I am looking for a book that would be able to flesh out proper business processes utilizing well defined modeling language/framework. Although UML is extremely useful for software development, the author's work did make its case stand with me on UML's usefulness as business process modeling tool.The examples are too simplistic and the suggested modeling diagrams are far too cluterred for a business personel to understand.(Cluttered diagrams on a simple example) The book would be better if it had a growing case study and used real world examples and diagrams."
3,"Very high level, often inconsistent","The models in this book are interesting but they are too high level to be useful. The modelling style is inconsistent e.g. missing multiplicities. Some of the models are contradictary.If you have absolutely no idea about any of this stuff, and are interested in the absolute basics, then this book might be useful. If you want to understand the subtleties of a business domain, it won't help."
4,good fun,"This, Benedict's debut published when he was only 23, remains his best work to date. He seems to have lost most of his audacity, which is really the charm of this book, in his subsequent work. Still, this book's best stories have a lot of fun with language, and Benedict is undoubtedly a very talented writer. None of his work, though, approaches that of Breece Pancake, the West Virginia writer who was in many ways Pinckney Benedict's inspiration (do all West Virginians have such outrageous names?), but who committed suicide at age 26. Pancake was a genius who basically could not handle the world; Benedict is very gifted, but is not a genius. I still reccomend this book--I just don't want to see Benedict's reputation, just because he is still alive, completely overshadow Pancake's."
3,Well written short stories,"These were very well written short stories but they often just seem to tail off into pointlessness.The set-ups are very promising and he has a fine ear for dialogue. His characters and situations are intriguing but the stories don't seem to go anywhere.They are pretty atmospheric and I really wished that they were a bit longer and actually led somewhere. They do end sounding quite samey as well.Some of the writing really is very impressive and the stories were always interesting, but I tended to have sense of disappointment when I actually finished reading each of the stories."
2,JW Pet Company Swing Bird Toy Small,"The swing was showed as small, it wasn't! It was for a large cage and I sent email and the company credited my refunded speedily. Thank you so much. Hopefully one will be design for a smaller cage as ""Little Bird"" needs a new one badly.Service is 5 STARSAnnCool CA"
4,No complaints here,"I have owned this kettle for 2 years. I have had none of the negative experiences listed by other owners/reviewers. Mine doesn't have a single chip, (I have electic burners). I haven't had trouble pouring from the kettle either. I believe the booklet that comes with it mentions not filling the water in the kettle more than a third full - which is still a considerable amount of water, enough for about 4 lrg mugs. The whistle stopper on the spout does get very hot though. I'm surprised people are having such trouble with their kettles; mine looks just as good as the day I got it."
1,Le Creuset tea kettle a disappointment,"I am writing this for my friend who just bought a Le Creuset teakettle. She has used it a short time and the bottom has been flaking off and sticking to the burner when she put it on, with water in, to heat up. There must have been a flaw in the process of its production somewhere. Can you tell her what to do?"
1,"Mine rusted, too","I received the kettle as a gift--and it ought to have lasted a lifetime. It did not. As other reviewers have noted, the inside of the kettle rusts and cracks within months. I only wish I had kept track of the warranty; it broke my heart to put the kettle in the trash."
1,"Poor Quality, Ruined my Cooktop",We received this teakettle as a wedding present and were very excited to use it. The FIRST time we used it the enamel on the bottom melted off onto our cooktop. This left a 2 inch red enamel raised scar on our otherwise new stove which will not come off. We are in the process of trying to get compensation from Le Crueset. We do not recommend this product.
2,Disapointment,"We got this tea kettle as a wedding present. When water is just hot, not even boiling, and I try to pour, the water splashes out of the spigot instead of pouring neatly into the cup. I've gotten scalded once or twice when the water splattered out on me, even when I was being careful. The other day I forgot to close the whistle and left it on the stove too long til the water burned off. I can't get the inside clean now, so I guess we'll get something else. It's too bad because it's a really nice looking kettle, but I don't want to be burned each time I try to pour a cup of tea. BTW, we hadn't had any problems with rust, although we let water sit in the kettle all the time."
4,"Great, long-lasting kettle","I have owned this kettle for about 4 years. It's great, has not rusted at all, no problems. The red is a prettier color than the flame, though."
2,Big Ego,"This book was a mistake on my part, I bought it used off the Internet and it had the wrong publish date thus I thought it would have something to do with his time working in the Reagan administration. It did not. The book looked to me to be some kind of pre presidential campaign book. It basically laid out his ideas on what he would change if he had the power. A few things come out of the book fairly quick; first he disliked the Carter Administration and most things Democratic. Next he has a rather large ego, so large he filled up 250 pages of ""I am the best"" dogma. I only kept reading because it got a funny after a time. Overall I was very disappointed in the book. I would think it would only be of interest to someone that is studying his life or is interested by egomaniacs."
5,Works for 2006 Ford Fusion,I have a 2006 Ford Fusion SE with the 6 speaker system. This wiring harness works just fine. You do not need the RCA piece for the 6 speaker system.
2,Missing the steering wheel control wire,"This wiring harness made upgrading the head unit in my '04 Crown Vic easy-- almost. It's missing the steering wheel control wire-- incredible because Metra's own Axxess ASWC steering wheel control box specifies this wire!Metra specifies this harness for my car on their website-- which is why I bought it. My work around was to pop one of the two unused wires for my application out, and pop it into hole 18 on the connector. I needed to remove the red plastic locking plate from the connector before removing and re-inserting the wire."
3,Took A Bit of Modification,"The connectors were correct, but some of the pins needed to have wires attached to make the harness fully functional. Fortunately, I have a wiring diagram for my truck, so I was able to figure out what wires to add."
1,Does not fit 2005 Ford Escape as advertised,Does not Fit an 05 Escape XLS. This is a big connector and the one for the Escape has the same number of wires only it is half the size. Check your connector size before ordering.
3,Pavilion Press Edition Not Proofread,"Hawthorne's tales are absolutely wonderful, but I would not be able to recommend this particular edition because it is so full of typographical errors that it appears not to have been proofread at all. There are random periods, a parenthesis where a letter should be, and frequent misspellings, which mar this wonderful reading experience."
2,Not the greatest war memoir,"This book was published in German in 1988 and tells of the author getting into the German military at age 18 (he was born in 1920). He became a paratrooper but only seems to have actually jumped in Holland and in Crete. He was also in Poland, Norway, Russia, Sicily, Italy, and France (at the time of the 1944 invasion).. He surendered in Germany in March of 1945 and spent a year in England as a POW (which sounded like the best of the time he had from 1938 to 1946). Much of the book is a recitation of not too interesting events in Sicily, Italy and France. There are many photos reproduced very poorly in the book and the few maps are singularily unhelpful. The evoluition of the author's thinking in regard to Hitler I found of interest--he says the women of Germany were more perceptive in regard to Naziism than the brain-washed men."
3,Good book but NOT the 2nd Edition.,"This is NOT the 2nd edition of the New Politics of Old Age Policy. It's a good book with very interesting articles but my course required the second edition, not the first. Amazon has this listed as the 2nd.They do, however, have a great return policy so that made returning / getting refunded quite easy."
2,"Shallow, disappointing","I understand that children love these books and love mysteries. I did too, when I was young. (actually, I like some now too. :-) )Sadly, I found the characters to be very shallow and too cheerful. When the art supplies were stolen, the children basically said, ""Oh darn. Well, let's buy some more."" When their work was destroyed they said, ""Oh, shucks. Well, we'll do it again."" When they started their business to raise money for the hospital (which I though was a great thing to suggest to children), they *instantly* had a full load of clients and the ability to carry out every task perfectly.The kids are just too perfect to be realistic. Other than that, my 8 yo seems to be very enthusiastic about the series. If they are properly researched, children may learn a few snippets of information with each one they read. If the child puzzles over the mystery, they might serve a little purpose of stimulating creative though."
5,excellent and could'nt be better,The dissipearing friend mystery is an exellent book and once you read it you can't put it down. The boxcar children find a new friend but for some reason she keeps dissapearing! Watch out for the very peculiar ending! I'd addvise 6-8 year olds to read this book.
1,Strap failed; I dropped my laptop.,"After two years of very light use (roughly 3-4 days of use per month), the metal swivel joint on the clasp that holds the strap to the bag wore out and spontaneously came apart, causing my bag to fall to the floor. I will not buy this brand again."
3,Panasonic review,"Good quality at a good price.. However, my Samsung has a slightly better picture. Would recommend as a second TV."
4,discover pascal in delphi,this is a book for learning pascal and for and indroduction to the tool of dephi . it introduces you to the windowing componets of delphi . which is hard to understand from most books . I recomend this book for those wishing to lear pascal and delphi tools.
5,Atmospheric,I really like this album...much stronger and upbeat than their previous work...Cyann and Ben & M83 are the best to put on after a late night out...recommended for anyone who likes foward thinking music...
1,LOST IN THE OZONE,THIS WAS THEIR VERY FIRST RECORD AND YOU CAN TELL!ITS THAT BAD DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!! BUT ON A GOOD NOTE THEY HAVE GOTTEN BETTER OVER THE YEARS!
5,Commander Cody,HOT ROD LINCOLN alone makes this a must have album (if your a gearhead) don't just buy the song it's worth the price to get the full album.
4,COUNTRY ROCKABILLY ROCK N' ROLL HONKY TONK AND MORE!!,I had this on vinyl and have finally replaced it with the CD. Like re-uniting with a great old friend. These guys could really cook. The strongest influence is probably rockabilly but plenty of rootsy country sounds Western swing and more. Great CD. the title song is classic.
5,The Acapulco Gold standard of hippie country and swing,"It's difficult to remember how we took this music when it was originally issued in the early 70s. Many of us were busy listening to the last remnants of 60s guitar rock morphing itself into the overblown stadium prattle that would hang on for several more years. So how did we end up listening to stone country, boogie-woogie and jump blues? It can all be pinned on Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen.The wedding of hippie sentiment (""Seeds and Stems"") with country, rock and boogie-woogie classics (""Hot Rod Lincoln"" ""20 Flight Rock"" ""Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar""), backed by the stellar playing of everyone concerned, and topped off with Cody's incredible showmanship (both live and on LP) was a package destined to gather up a lot of new ears.This is the band's debut LP, and though they'd record many more excellent releases, I'm not so sure they ever topped this one as a statement of just who they were. A stone classic, so to speak."
5,the BEST of all,"This band is without a doubt one of the finest bands ever put together, Georgie Auld, Ray Connif, Hot Lips Page, Dave Tough, Steve Lipkins, Jerry Jerome, and ofcourse Artie. This was the best of all of Shaws bands - it swings like few others, plays some good romantic numbers, and even handles the pop-tunes well,this is a great cd, and it's from the orchestra you here the least of."
5,Great CD,"I'm suprised no one has said anything about this cd.I think this is Henry Mancini conducting Glen Miller's orch, but I can't be sure. That said, this is the best Glen Miller I've ever heard. There is a really kick to the music here."
4,LOVE IN SONG AND STORY,LOVE AND WANDERING INTO THE MORE THAN NORMAL AS NORMAL. AND FEELING IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU AS WELL!!
1,Crap,"bought it wanting to frame few canvases I bought on ebay.they are very low quality, they cut in wrong angles, they do not fit one each other.I am sorry I did not got the michael's ones which were much better quality.they are not cut at 45 degrees, each one is in a different way."
1,Bad Batts,Odered two for our two phones. Mine won't maintain a charge for a week when I don't make a single call. My wife makes a 10-15 minute call and has to charge the phone. Something wrong with these batteries.
2,Very disappointing,This battery was listed for my cell phone. It did not hold a charge. You get what you pay for.
4,fresh whipped cream,"These are great for my whipped cream can, but my one complaint is that they don't last very long. They lose their oompf after about 8 oz. of cream. I have the smallest container, so I'd hate to realize you'd need 2 chargers or more for each can of whipped cream."
3,A Little More Oomph would be Nice,"I have the Isi Professional Pint Whipped Cream Dispenser. Although the instructions clearly state that one charger is good for pint applications, I found that NOT to be true. The charger lacks oomph after a few rounds. And maybe the dispenser is lacking as well, because after being refrigerated, I can never get any more gas out of the charger. VERY disappointing, considering how expensive the whole set-up is.My family and I are die-hard whipped cream lovers, but I'm wondering whether the additional expense of owning an ISI is worth it. Honestly, I don't really see much of a differnce between cream produced by the Isi and ReddiWip. Painful when it costs about $5 to make a pint of whipped cream, and the past few weeks my local grocery store is selling the ReddiWip 12 oz can on sale for $1.79!"
5,10-pack N2O cream whipper chargers,I've used these chargers for years and never had any problems with them. We checked around our town and can't find them anywhere.
2,Cream Whipper Chargers,"The product was received in a shipping box much larger than the container the chargers were packed in. Some bubble pack was in the shipping box, but not enough to fill the shipping box. The chargers were totally loose in the shipping box. Until we use the chargers we do not know if they were damaged during shipment."
4,Dreaming,"""I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder...""Moody and magical, this album takes you through a feminine emotional experience. Each artist presents her unique ideas and dreamy world of love, making this a relaxing pop album about love and loss. You have probably heard all the songs on the radio, but the way these are arranged has new appeal.Music by Sade adds depth and dreamy elegance, Jennifer Lopez brings a breezy sensual appeal and Delta Goodrem has a refreshing voice. Cyndi Lauper concludes the album with a dreamy song filled with energy and hope.""I found a dreamthat I could speak to...""~The Rebecca Review"
2,Too many cats!,I really liked the fish scenes but there were too many scenes of domestic cats. One scene was a cat in someone's house!!! Not nature scenes by any means!
1,I want my money back,"I was really excited to get my first le creuset kitchenware, but only to be very disappointed - the kettle started showing rust on the inside within two months which rendered it completely unusable. I felt awfully cheated, and especially so because I had bought it at a very reputable gourmet cooking store in san francisco!My advice - steer clear of enamelware and buy stainless for durability."
1,buy the Brittany!!,"I have loved every Le Creuset product I have purchased with the big exception of the Whistling Teakettle! I did away with it a couple of months ago and bought the Brittany model to replace it. The Whistling kettle burned my hand on several occasions, as the design of the spout allowed the hot water to spit and jump right out of the pot! The whistle is removable and you must put your hand near the spout to remove it for pouring. Even after waiting a minute after taking the water off the heat, the water would still jump from the spout. While a little larger than I would have liked, the Brittany does not have the same problem and the whistle can be safely flipped up before pouring. I have been very pleased with my new kettle and would recommend the Brittany by far over the Whistling."
2,Disappointed,"I've got this kettle a couple of days ago,and I am returning it already!. It is a beautiful kettle,but,you cannot fill it more than a third of it's capacity,or it'll spit out the water when it's boiling (what is that about?),it drips when you pour the water resulting in a poodle underneath the kettle,and the major reason for me to returning it back is that it gives the water a very funny taste!Pitty,because Le Creuset is a fantastic brand."
1,Are Zero Stars Possible???,"First off, I want to tell you I am a BIG fan of Le Creuset - I have 8 cast iron pieces, 10 stoneware pieces, and their set of spatulas, so I am familiar with the product and quality. BUT, I am extremely disappointed in my kettle. Purchase June 27, and used only twice, the enamel is being expelled, explosivley, from the bottom of the kettle. The enamel glass shards are sharp as razor blades and are a hazzard. After the second use an area of approx 3/4"" x 2"" was clear of enamel. After the third use, the area increased to 1"" x 3"", down to bare metal, for the most part. This is obviously a defective and dangerous product - it does not appear to be an isolated insidence, either. The kettle is being returned to Le Creuset, under Warranty, for replacement. The matter is also being reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission as a dangerous / hazzardous item."
2,"Though beautiful, alas, mine rusted too...","One shouldn't have to empty water out after every use. One shouldn't be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice. That is not a functional teapot, if that may be the case. Though it is the prettiest teapot around, it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while. Le Creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime, but the enamelware can't even touch the quality of the cast-iron cookware. Fortunately, the company stands by its products and I am sending mine back for a replacement. See www.lecreuset.com for details..."
3,"Nice, exept for the whistle.","I had the same bad expeience with the whistle as others; it is difficult to remove and when you yank it hard, you may spill boiling water all over yourself. You can't pour the hot water out without removing it. I got into the habit of (following directions, ha!) only filling it half way and it has never cracked or rusted. Maybe having a gas range is the key? We've had it several years and love it. All except for the whistle, which I have now lost. So now I sometimes forget I put the water on and the kitchen gets a steam bath, Oh well."
2,beautiful but lid chipped when I dropped it,Just want to warn everyone that it chips pretty easily. I took it off the shelf and the lid (which was not securely in place) fell to the floor. About a 1.5-inch chip resulted on the edge. It won't affect the function of the kettle but I was disappointed to see the beautiful enamel chip off so easily. Handle yours with care!
5,The Vintage Yoda!,"The Vintage Yoda is awsome! It has real fabric that makes very cool! Even for such a cute guy, he even has amazing articulation! Yoda is very rare and hard to find! I hope that it comes back in stock so other people can enjoy it!"
3,Theyre ok,"Honestly, I liked these at first but then I got sick of the taste really quick. They aren't the tastiest thing on the planet. Kind of plastic tasting. Its just ""OK"" in my book."
3,Good but a little too sweet...,Bought these to have as a handy snack/breakfast during work while I was pregnant. These were good but a little too sweet for my taste...I definitely prefer the Chocolate bars better. Usually I could stomach half of the bar and then finish the other half at a later time. My daughter is almost 5 months now and I still have one bar left from the package...so it really wasn't my favorite taste.
1,It leaked and caused floor damage,"My Watts ""Floodsafe"" washing machine hose leaked within a few months. It put out a fine spray during the fill cycle that was sufficient to moisten the dry wall and leak into the sub-floor but not sufficient to leave a puddle on the floor where I could see it. Within four months of installing this hose, I had over $6000 of damage to my walls and floors!"
4,Multicultural Anthology,"prose and poetry from authors of many traditions. Each comes complete with questions for critical reading, thinking, discussion, and writing. Good training for writers of all kinds."
2,Life Everlasting book,It turned out this was not the book I was looking for and didn't meet my need.Since it was a free e-book I was not out much.
2,This book's not for everyone....,"I found when I read this that it was just a second-rate futuristic book. The plot wasn't very interesting and it was slightly corny whenever they would mention something that came from the past, which would be the present time for us. Unless you really like something like that, don't bother wasting your money, just rent it."
3,A description....,"From Back Cover:Cimarron Langtry returns to the land of his youth and haunted dreams to rekindle the people's uprising against the occupation regime and the dread army of the Clankers.His life is worth spit - until he joins forces with a ruthless mercenary, a mystic giant, anda beautiful, mysterious healer. The in turn forge an alliance with a race of subterranean mutants and the proud, fierce new Comanches."
4,Great feel good movie,"I try to DVR this movie every years so thrilled to finally own this. A great story of how unexpected life can be. A great surprise in the end that was unexpected. Also, love movies that can tell a story without all the filth that is such a part of Hollywood today. Look forward to watching this for years to come."
2,Not a good storyline.,"Why do movies....that could be good, have to have a story line of someone being immoral, having a child outside of marriage & then making things right....yes the child finally gets a father....but where are the good old movies where there is no physical contact before marriage & you actually love & honor the person you feel in love with by respecting them & saving the marriage night to be special?"
3,Family movie - a little boring and contrived,I thought this movie had to work too hard to have a plot. It was there - don't misunderstand me - but it felt contrived. More fake than even your average family friendly Christmas movie. Still it wasn't a waste of my time - and was overall enjoyable.
4,Typical Christmas movie,This movie is the same as other Christmas movies. It has the same plot of a dozen other similar flicks.
5,Favorite Finally on DVD,"I discovered this movie a couple of Christmases ago, and was delighted that it is now available on DVD. This is one of those movies that deserves an annual outing, so kudos to those who make the decisions to take movies to disc. Thanks!"
4,A feel good Christmas movie,"A good family Christmas movie you'll enjoy year after year. This is a good addition to a Chrismas collection. It is not a classic, just a nice movie."
1,Over-priced candy,"It did nothing, just made me feel drowsy every time i took it. I've had better results with cheap creatine powder."
1,danger! dont buy,for your health dont buy this i used it for about 2 monthes and then it sent me to the ER my heart rate was 160 its normaly 72 my blood press sky rocketed so please for your health dont do this to yourself
4,"Decent product, a little chalky compared to the grape",Best creatine product ive found so far. Orange is good but i like the grape flavor better. I think this is my 3rd purchase of this brand
5,"Excellent, worth every penny!","Will never buy powder again if I have a choice. This stuff is amazing. Taste is decent, sort of similar to a bottle-cap candy tart. A bit firm, careful with your teeth. The best part is walking out of the gym and eating them on the drive to work. Easy to carry, no mixing. Even minimal aftertaste."
5,A convenience,"I know what you're thinking, yes they give you creatine, yes you don't need to use a blender, but how do they taste. Well, I was wondering that too, and I have good news for you.The smell is like that of those bottle caps candy you used to get on Halloween, and the taste(I got orange) is also similar to the candy. The only difference is in texture, the best way to describe it is eating orange flavored, superfine sand. It is kind of gritty, but thank god I don't have to use my blender to get some creatine. The chewables are about the size of a marshmallow(the small ones), and you are supposed to take 4 of them daily. As for the results, they are typical for this kind of supplement, so basically however your body reacts to the stuff. I'm satisfied though, I would buy these again."
5,taste good,"Taste good, but are gritty. it is regular creatine monohydrate, so it is to be expected. Cheap and easy to take with me."
5,Excellent,Removes all traces of makeup gently and thoroughly. Your face feels clean but not tight or dry.
2,cracked in half at 450F...,"I loved this dish, and have been using it for three months now. as with all LC cookware, one becomes accustomed to the fact that they are extremely reliable, so I am kind of at a loss now.I haven't gone above 400F with this dish so far, but tonight a recipe instructed 450F. the description on its packaging allows up to 500F, so I wasn't even second guessing.then, 5 mins later a snapping sound from the oven, and, voila, it was cracked in half with surgical precision, along the shorter axis. now I have two small pans, each with its own handle.with this exact piece it's not about the price exactly, and it _was_ great till it lasted.I'm just a little bewildered about the quality and not so assured and relaxed about LC stoneware and their proclaimed heat resistance anymore. better stay below 400F, esp with the more costly pieces."
2,cracked in half,"As noted in another review, our oval dish cracked in half while baking a pot pie at 350deg. There is a life time guarantee, but too much of a hassle so I'm reluctantly ordering another one."
2,A bit of a disappointment.,The product is fun to use and reasonably nifty looking but the soda itself is a disappointment. It just isn't fuzzy enough for a true seltzer lover. I love eating at Sam's Romanian Jewish restaurant on Manhattan's Lower East Side and getting the strong old fashion clown school bottles they keep stocked but this just isn't the same. Make it hurt! Please!
2,ISI Soda Siphons you get what you pay for.,I bought this item to replace a 25 year old Kovocas Seltzer Bottle it doesn't even come close to the old model. The container is smaller and the amount of fizz is about half. I have started buying soda water until I can find a better bottle.
3,OK but I found a better alternative,"I bought this and it works fine. But, it is not as fizzy as I'd like. There is an alternative that lets you control the fizziness and is cheaper per bottle. The Soda Club seltzer maker more than makes up for its higher cost by being cheaper per bottle (30 cents v 80 cents for this one). If you drink more than one bottle a day as we do, that pays for itself pretty quickly.Both are better, cheaper and more convenient than store-bought. Also, more fun. So I encourage you to buy one or the other if you drink a lot of seltzer."
2,Disappointed,"Boys small - Size chart is misleading. I did not get boys 8, but instead received size 2-4. Very disappointed"
2,Says Large adult...but its not,"I ordered over $100.00 in t-shirts thru Amazon.com this is the ONLY one that didn't fit...its from old stock, because were all the others had a tagless tag, this one had the itchey tag hanging in the back,said large, but its the FIRST large t-shirt from mountain t's that DOESN'T FIT...beautiful Shirt...love it but CAN'T PUT IT ON TO WEAR..."
3,too small?,"The shirt was nice, but way smaller than a typlical 6-8 kids medium. If the exchanged goes OK, I'll give this transaction a 4.5 star review."
4,very good deal if compared with kitchen store prices on same item,"Happy to found this item on line,it seems to be a very good purchase,will always go back to purchase more."
2,Don't work very well.,"For some reason, the cartridges do not seem to provide enough N20 to whip the cream sufficiently. I've been using this product for years and have never had this problem before. Perhaps the cartridges weren't filled to capacity. Don't know."
3,Product was not new,The box in which the chargers were packaged was broken and the chargers had spilled out all over the shipping box. The chargers themselves seemed used or recycled. The first one I tried did work but the overall impression was that someone had scooped up some parts off the factory floor and dropped them in some pre-used packaging.
4,These are good quality.,"I've bought ISI and another brand and am sticking with these. Occasionally a charge won't seem full or won't hold in the dispenser, but that could also be user error. My sense, though, is that it happens less often with this brand."
5,"great product, fast delivery","great product, fast delivery, I love the ISI cream maker and you cannot make it work without the charges, This is a gift for a friend, I have had mine for a long time and love, love, love it"
3,"good textbook for a general virology class, esp. for price","Alan Cann's textbook is laid out in an odd order, but his description of general mechanisms of viral gene regulation is wonderfully done. The only thing that could have made this book better is the illistrations. They are pretty bad, but that is what one gets for only $30. Good job Cann!!!"
5,"WOW, eye opener.","Perfect balance of awareness vs anger! So easily, Velcrow could have gone further and stopped right at the point it needed to so the message was conveyed properly. His other documentary, Fierce Light is the same. Beyon d worth the money. Motivating at the least! Company had good price and great service!"
2,Not worth watching,"My wife and I are enthusiastic ballet patrons and have been seeing several ballets every year for the past 16 years. This movie was boring and illuminated little. If you are not enthusiastic about ballet, you would quit this production early on."
3,"Good, but requires other books to explain the missing pieces","I went through the first ten chapters twice. The second time around it all started to make a lot more sense. The book would be great if the author took the time to explain terminology a bit more or ""why"" certain things were being done. It feels a bit like ""follow these steps"" but you don't know the WHY. I augmented the book with other MFC books to fill in the WHYS. The application you build is truly neat and you will find yourself adding to it. The last couple of chapters on database programming, ActiveX and using ATL are useful in obtaining a little taste on those topics but the chapters are just appetizers. I am looking forward to reading the other books in the WROX series."
4,"Good on MFC, but gets confusing towards the end","The first 10 or so chapters (through database programming) are well-written and teach a lot about MFC. As the core of the book, anyone who knows C++ will get a good grasp of how MFC works through those chapters. However, when the author starts to dive into COM he loses focus. To be true to the title, the last part of the book should have stuck more to MFC . Instead, I spent a lot of time writing code on interface libraries and other things I really don't understand. I would have given this book a lower rating except that those last few chapters got me hooked on COM, and I want to know more."
5,The best way to start MFC.,"This book is simply amazing! It starts by teaching you the basics of Win95 and MFC, and leads you to advanced stuff. If you know c++, and have'nt got a clue on Windows programming, this book is a must! gives you a good grasp on the material and a good base to start from."
3,Not for keg dispensing,I bought this hoping it would fit in my Cornelius Keg CO2 Charger. After much trouble I was able to make it work but I would advise against it. These hold very little co2 and I ran through the box very quickly. Buy another product if you are trying to dispense beer through a soda keg charger.
4,A little pricey,"I bought these to go with a soda syphon that I bought for a gift. Thought they were a little expensive; will have to look for a cheaper version. Worked fine, however. Hope the cheaper ones work as well."
1,Don't Buy these!,"Don't buy these! You can only fill the siphon 3/4 full of water with these chargers, or the siphon will spray water everywhere when you attemt to charge it. So you only get 3/4 of a liter of soda per cartridge, instead of the full liter you're supposed to get. Also, the soda produced is very flat, and customer service for this product does not respond after repeated attempts to contact.Purchase the Leland 8g soda gas instead, it seems to produce more bubbles an the siphon won't spray unexpectedly, no matter how full you fill it."
5,Soda Siphon cartridges/chargers,These soda chargers are hard to find. I was very happy to order them on the Internet and receive them in two days.
3,"Not Economical, Just Eco-friendly","It clearly states in the description that two cartridges should be used for a liter of soda. That makes the liter of soda cost $2.40 (if you get free shipping.) Do not compare this cost to that of Perrier or San Pellegrino because those waters have finer bubbles, akin to Champagne, some of which (Gerolsteiner) are naturally occurring. This is regular soda, with large bubbles. I buy a 12 pack of soda in cans for $3, which gives me 4.5 liters. The upside to the cartridges is having fresh soda on demand, with less packaging, shipping space, and you can recycle the steel cartridges. However, it would be worth it to look for these in bulk."
5,Great!,"I've been using ISI chargers for years. They work very well -- I've never had any issues with them at all. One charger is enough for one siphon of water. Water comes out crisp and tasty. I am totally addicted to it.One trick is to vigorously shake the siphon up and down after you've discharged the charger into it. This makes the water bubbly from the very beginning.Yes, using one siphon many times would be nice. But then, since I'd be breaking laws of physics, I'd also quit my job and create my daily bread out of thin air..."
1,soda siphon cartridges,"These don't last long enough. I thought each one could be used with several quarts of water, but they are good ONLY ONE TIME. Very diappointing."
3,Soda Chargers,Chargers worked but the end product was not very bubbly. I am not sure weather it is the charger or the proceedure. The instructions did not give a help section.
3,This is a waste of my time,This is a waste of my time to have to complete this review for more that the rating star that I entered
2,I have found these else where.,Go to specs. You know the liquor store. They have the same pack of these (10) count for 8 bucks. I know your not saving much but you get to go straight to the store for them instead of waiting for them to be shipped. Been thinking of getting a soda maker but didn't know about these things but did find them at specs on accident so I'm looking forward to my lil soda maker now. :) Good luck and I hope this helps.
2,Below average,"As a native speaker, I expected this DVD to feature a French voice. The female voice in the DVD is certainly NOT the voice of a native speaker. Her pronunciation and overall accent simply do not sound good. In that case how can anyone expect their kids to pronounce properly? It would be like using a French accent to teach english. As for the content, it does not look professional, almost as if it had been shot with a personal camera then edited on iMovies. Definitely not worth the price, I don't recommend buying this product."
5,great product,this is wonderful...a great way to show a good start of a language to a child. i actually play it for my 7 month old and he loves it!
3,Starting to HATE this pot!!!,"I loved this pot when I first bought it because it was a nice heavy pot that I could do things with like brown onions and carrots in it before adding additional ingredients, etc. Also, I get water to boil much faster in this pot then I ever did in my lighter weight pots. But there are two downsides that make me wish I had gone to our local All-Clad outlet and spent the extra money for one of their stockpots instead: one reason is because the enamel scratches fairly easily - I find this annoying on a fairly expensive item because I expect such items to last a long time. But the reason why I am starting to HATE this pot is because pasta sticks to the bottom of it ALL THE TIME. I never have this happen with stainless steel clad aluminum pots. This pot just might be ending up on ebay."
3,don't confuse this with the Le Creuset cast iron pots,"Please be aware that this is not the same as the heavy Le Creuset clad cast-iron pots. It is lightweight and inexpensive, which has its good side, since a 12-quart cast iron stockpot would be too heavy to lift, plus terribly expensive. It looks good on the counter, and it is ok for some things (it is big enough to make a double batch of jam without boiling over, and it is good for boiling a whole lot of corn on the cob). If you are cooking anything that might stick or scorch, do not use this pan! In spite of being treated very delicately, the bottom of my two pans quickly became badly scratched up. This is not the pan you want if you are making a big pot of clam chowder, because it will surely scorch and stick to the bottom of the pan."
2,The real name of this game is Backward Warfighter.,"Tom Clancy's shooter again disappointed everyone who was fascinated by the old game they created, which offered people lots of great time such as ""Ghost Recon"".Backward Warfighter again owned new technique, new toys, and new graphic, which is just pretty, but the content is absolutely not suit the title of the game. Your teammate are so dumb that they can't follow your simple command, and they can't even follow your pace! This is very annoyed, and shows again how sloppy this game is. UBI still don't want to solve their biggest problem,AI.The reason why I gave this game two star instead of one is mainly because I don't want to be too harsh to a game series that I used to love."
2,good luck getting it to work,"I have a brand new machine (albeit a laptop) with 1gb ram. but I can't get the game to run at all!I've spent the past 2 days on every forum under the sun, all to nought.It appears there only very few graphics cards that this game will work with & even if you have one of those, many people are reporting crashes, bad patches, all sorts of problems.having read all the comments, my advice would be to stay away from this until Ubisoft sort out all the (many) problems"
1,"Move along now, nothing to see here...","The original Ghost Recon got me into pc gaming. Waited and waited for the next installment. Five years later, GRAW... Do not waste your time on this juvenile piece of junk. Your computer probably can't run it anyway."
1,Not worth the money,"Not worth the money. Takes too long to install, takes too long to load, and takes to long to replay over and over and over again because there is no save button.In short, a game that falls well short of the standard set by F.E.A.R. and the like.Might be worth it if it was in the $9.95 rack at Wal-Mart."
1,Watch out for the copy protection,"More than a little bit of a dissappointment, if you've been into the Tom Clancy tactical games. I thought GRAW would really set a new standard. So much for hype. I don't know if it is because it was developed as a console game (they tend to be a bit ""dumbed down"" compared to PC games - please don't take offense if you only play console games) or was badly ported or the developers just ran out of good ideas. On top of this, it has Star Force protection, which is a major problem. Wierdly, Ubi pulled SF from its other major release this year but has not (as of this writing) issued a patch to remove it from GRAW. You can remove SF from your system but then you cannot play the game (it will reinstall the stuff). Given the problems folks have had with SF, if you are going to get Ghost Recon, I recommend waiting until it a patch is issued or until SF is removed from the disk."
3,Not in the tradition of Ghost Recon,What made Ghost Recon a great game has been removed from GRAW. The open play of the previous games in this series is missing. Not being able to Save your progress except at the checkpoints takes away from the fun. Forces you to replay long segments for one bad mistake.
4,Great Game,not into war -soldiers and belical toys but this one sets another standard on strategical planning during an FPS
3,GRAW Disappoints,"No savegames, just (sometimes) impossible checkpoints. Team AI just plain stupid at times. I find the game very frustrating. I was an avid Ghost Recon fan, until this version was released."
4,Classic Olivia---I CLEARLY LOVE this album!,"Olivia churned out album after album through out the 70's, but Clearly love stands out with its simple catchy melodies and Olivia's pure voice. The songs on this album are great to sing along to and, while they all represent her 70's style, they do so by covering a wide range of genres, such as the jazzy, blues-like Something Better to Do, the optimistic anthem Let it Shine, the poppy Slow Down Jackson, and the emotional cover of He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother. By far, the most moving performance on the album is the somber Just a Lot of Folk--this song displays her ability to filter emotions into lyrics. How many singers can take lyrics that include the word ""marshmallow"" and still move the listener to tears? On that note, however, I could have done without the cover of Summertime Blues. That being said...this album is CLEARLY one of her best---put it in on a rainy day and simply ""Let it Shine."""
3,Horrible packaging!,"First, I loved this album growing up, and for whatever reason, this was my favorite all time Olivia album cover. However, the packaging was a great disappointment not only for this CD, but all the Olivia Remastered CDs. Sure it comes with a booklet of lyrics and pictures from the original albums, but EVERY photo is so grainy that it looks absolutely amatueristic. This includes the front and back covers and the photos inside the booklet. I would have sworn they were booklet copies if I hadn't purchased them from Amazon directly."
3,I don't know what all the hype is about,"I've been reading nothing but rave reviews about this song, it as all sorts of buzz humming about, but I just don't see it. It's on the top of all sorts of DJs set lists and what not, so I was expecting a phenomenal tune. What I got instead was some really good house, but not amazingly good. A good tune, but since it is on his new album ""Tourism"", you'd be better off getting that instead. The remixes are good, but I would recommend them only for fans."
4,Amazing,"This album not only reflects the dark mood sustained throughout the movie, but it offers up a variety of music - enough to suit everyone's taste. There really isn't a single song on this soundtrack that doesn't rock! The ONLY drawbacks are the two tracks from the film's original score. They're very cool, but a little too ""classical"", to fit in with this rougher crowd. But don't let that stop you... buy this soundtrack NOW! It goes in and out of print, and you might miss your chance to own such a killer cd! Enjoy..."
3,Favorite from Youth,"Ahh.. Nostalgia, The CD has 5 great tracks on it that are rockin' good nostalgic songs from the early 90's rock/metal scene. I highly reccommend it based on my fond memories, however it is by no means an amazing album, it is what it is, with 3 strong tracks starting it off and overall enjoyable. Probably not worth full price, of course."
2,Too small and fake,"First of all the ring is way too small for the figures. If you try to have the figures do a move like the suplex the figures feet hit the ropes. Second the mat doesn't really bounce. Plus the mat bends at the corners of it. And its all plastic the real ring has metal posts, cloth aprons and when somebody suplexes another guy from one side of the ring the guys feet don't hit the ropes on the other side. When I first bought this ring the turnbuckle broke off when I was putting it together. I have had 3 of these rings. Overall its crap."
2,Don't bother,"I've have purchased this ring 2 times for my son and he got another as a gift. With all three I had the same problem, the ring posts broke. I gave up on getting him anther one. I'm looking for one with better quality and durability."
3,"Cool, ok?","""I think it's cool, but ok, but good, but a little to small, but a little boring if you play with it to long a day, and the big showwww..."""
5,"WWE TO THE NEXT LEVEL, BABY!","this toy is definitly 1 of the best WWE toys EVER created. the ropes are really nice. every thing on it works extremely well except that the ring dosent really 'bounce'. however, it will bounce when you make a wrestler do a top of the rope move on to another wrestler.i read one review that said the turn buckles were fimsey. thet is NOT true. that persons may have been because he did not put it in all the way. i reccomend this toy to every wrestler fan in the world."
3,this ring not good.,"This ring is not good the ring posts break, and the biggest promblem is it is to SMALL i dont like it at all it is just junk."
5,Combined Book Review,"Wow! What a gold mine of a book, If you are a Finney lover, this is a book you need to get. If not truly it is a must read. Most excellent!"
1,Warning...read the label!,"Unfortunately, the fine print on the label says that these are made in China. Very disappointing to find this out, as I just can't trust dog treats and jerky that were made in China, no matter which brand...after so many dogs were poisoned from jerky made there."
5,Big and Sturdy,"I'm very pleased with my Vanguard Tracker. I had a cheapo Wal-Mart tripod that broke and I didn't want to have to go through that again. This one is on the heavier side but I like that; it'll hold more than enough weight for my setup. I'm not using it for backpacking so I didn't feel the need for a carbon fiber tripod.Overall, a good value for the money and I don't think I'll have to worry about this one breaking."
4,Truely one of Williams and Spielberg's greatest collaborations,"The movie scared me to death when I saw it in high school and still, to this day, it never fails to enthrall me. A large part of that is due to Williams' exquisite soundtrack. It is simple and complex at the same time, underscoring the feelings and mood of the characters with sublime power.This is a wonderful cd package with many extra cuts that the album version just couldn't accomodate. I love the extra tracks.What, in my mind, differentiates good movie and tv score composers from the great ones is the great use subtile sound images that do not take your attention from the screen.Williams' is a master at that. Though some of his later works is repetitious, his early work still shines -- it is great MUSIC as well as soundtrack. You just cannot find a more stunning opening note to a movie than that first drawn string of the shark's theme."
5,Great music score for a horror movie classic,"What makes this film music such a powerful accompaniment to the movie is what the cues suggest, with what viewers and listners are imagining which may be more powerful than the actual sighting of the killer shark. John Williams' ominous and eerie opening theme sets the tone for the film even though the great white isn't really seen at all until quite late in the film. The moody harp and string themes during the underwater scenes are very effective, but perhaps the best cue of all is the dark, gloomy ""Quint's Tale"", where the events surrounding the fate of the U.S.S. Indianapolis are recounted. This CD edition is better that its predecessor, with bonus tracks and a nice booklet with photos and information about the film score."
5,The Greatest Ever! Period!,"I am in total awe of the Anniversay CD collection of the greatest film score ever written. I have probably listened to the original score 10,000 times in my life. So when I received this new Anniversary edition I was a little skeptical. From the first note of the cd I knew I was in for something special. The clarity is amazing, the bass is bone crunching. I have seen the movie itself at least 1,000 times. On this CD they have added music from the film that were not on the original release that are my favorites. Listening to ""The Pier Incident"" I can total envision the pier slowly turning around in the ocean to pursue it's hopeful prey. Anyway, I could on for days. I can guarantee that this cd will never come out of my cd player. If you only buy one movie soundtrack let it be this one. Sit back and listen to the greatest music ever written for any film. Period!:)"
4,John Williams is the Great!!,"We all remember watching the movie Jaws. Seeing the shark take it's first victim. But what would it be like without the music. Just listening to a few notes of Jaws, gives me the chills, just like the first time I watched the movie."
1,MAJOR FAUX PAX,"I'm sorry, but how can you possibly have a soundtrack that omits the best musical moment of the whole movie?I am, of course, referring to Robert Shaw's (Captain Quint) classic rendition of an old sailor diddy...which he so memorably serenaded Mister Hooper with after inquiring about Hooper's Anit-Shark Cage!....""farewell and aduei(sic?) to my fair Spanish ladiesfarewell and aduei to my ladies of Spain.For we've received orders, we're to sail back to Boston.And so, never more, shall we see you again."""
1,Not what I expected.,"I realize it has been a long time since this product was being manufactured but it must have been stored improperly or was not really authentic Whipped Creme Makeup because it smelled ""off"" and the texture was not the same as the product I used for at least 20 plus years. I was disappointed and will never buy discontinued make up again."
1,cracked in the oven after 2 months,"I was very pleased with the Le Creuset baking dishes I have (I have the Poterie 10"" x 13"" deep dish baker, 14"" oval baker, and 9"" square dishes as well as this one). However, my 12"" dish just cracked down the middle while I was cooking a pork roast in it at 425 degrees. It had only been in the oven about 45 minutes. I am sorely disappointed and now I am wondering if I wasted my money on the others. I have only had it for about 2 1/2 months."
1,Le cusinart 12.5 by 8.5,"Like several of the other commentors, our broke after 2 months with a crack down the middle"
1,"Once a Favorite dish, now in two pieces.","After only using this rectangle dish twice, it broke directly down the middle in a cold oven set to 350 degrees. I was positive,if I followed the directions exactly by placing the dish in a cold over to allow for slow heating it would last longer than the other's who posted negative reviews. Boy, was I wrong. I emailed the company to see how they intended to handle my claim, I never even received a reply. I will never buy stoneware from Le Creuset ever again. I have two other pieces of the Le Creuset stoneware that I'am just terrified to use now. I will only buy enameled cast iron if I do buy from them again."
2,A crime reporter's dream job,"There is some effectively atmospheric writing in this rather mediocre thriller, but it takes incredibly long to gain any momentum. The protagonist's access to police work is beyond all credibility, and although Mr. Connelly creates a couple of nice twists the poet's identity surprises nobody familiar with the genre. I think the author might learn something from the hysterical absurdities of Patricia Cornwell. In other words, Mr. Connelly seems to take himself much too seriously as a writer."
3,Good suspense - poor logic,"I liked reading the book. It provides a lot of exciting suspense, and it's hard to put down.However, there are many flaws in the logic, many unanswered questions, and many unlikely events."
2,Ending NOT an ending,"Although the book was an easy read, and I quickly got into the characters I found the ending to be LESS than satisfying - actually it DIDN'T end. It NOT only left the author open to write a sequel - it is ABSOLUTELY necessary in order to determine - ""why"" who did what. I read 500 pages and haven't got a clue in the world what motivated the character that ""did it"". I DO NOT read a book in anticipation of the ""next"" one. I read the beginning, middle and expect an END. I like to read books that have reappearing character - but I do like to know what has happened in the book I've just read! If this is Mr. Connelly's way of manipulating his ""audience"" to purchase the next book in line - it doesn't work for me. I WILL NOT purchase the ""sequel"" - nor will I most likely purchase another by this author - for that reason."
3,Gripping stuff; shame about the ending,"This book kept me up into the wee-hours three days running. I ended up feeling as frustrated as Jack himself when the plot twisted unexpectedly against him. Very well written with at times gruesome, yet believable detail. I have to admit though, it ended with a fizzle rather than a bang. The unbelievable, unexplained and unfortunately unsatisfying ending stopped this being a really good book. Swap the last thirty pages and... who knows"
5,Need to stay awake? Read 'The Poet',I purchased this book after reading the jacket and am I sure glad I did. This story caused many a days at work w\ bloodshot eyes. I found myself reading until my head could no longer stay up. The characters have personality and charisma. Usually I can see things coming but this ending absolutely blind-sided me. Great book!!! It made me go right to the bookstore and buy all of his other works!
4,It would be great if not the ending,"I love Michael Connelly books and this one is also pretty good. It has the atmosphere so familiar from Harry Bosch series (a little dark, a little lonely) - although I think nothing can beat Harry Bosch. Anyway, the story was great (if maybe a little slower then usual although it doesn't mean this is a shortcoming), the characters are very well developed, the suspense is present and it was scary... until the ending, which I found very disappointing. Without revealing the plot I would just say that I found the ending totally unwarranted. It just wasn't logical and seemed made up just to finish the story in some unexpected way. I still give the book four stars since even with this ending it's a good book and I can recommend it to all Michael Conelly fans."
3,Good Storyline - Parts Insult the Reader,This book has an amazing storyline but certain parts of the book bothered me enought to give it three stars. There are so many details in the investigation parts of the book that it is difficult to absorb the facts - and then anticipate what's happening. The thing that bothered me the most was the whole drugging of victims with cough med.'s and then hypnotizing them. I actually laughed out loud. I still liked this book (it was scary) but I preferred Concrete Blonde. More consistent and beleivable.
5,Engaging Story,Michael Connelly is a great writer. I enjoy the Kindle App version as easy to read and always with me.
4,The Poet,The Poet by Michael Connelly is a good book. Arrived in good shape. The Poet is an exciting read and I would recommend it to all mystery lovers!
4,The Classic that kicked me off,"This was the Michael Connelly book that got me hooked on him. A number of Harry Bosch novels followed, equally good, some in fact a tad better. While Bosch has become a Connelly reader favorite, I can't help feeling that McEvoy was closer to Connelly's own past experiences as a crime reporter.It's Connelly's writing and his ability to give you different shades of a character and what drives them that made me want to pick up his other books, despite the fact that I was disappointed with this book's ending, thus one-star off. The fact that he kept me gripped enough for the other 95%, enough to put him in my top list of authors, tells a story within itself."
2,Could have been much better...,"This was my first MC book and it could have been much better. It starts off rather demented but once you get past the first 100 pages, the plot is a page turner. While it is completely unbelievable, a good read doesn't have to be 100% realisitic. The ending is what kills this book. As the reader, you will be left wondering what just happened!"
4,The Poet,Another great read by Michael Connelly. You can always depend on him to take you on a wild ride with many plot twists and turns. He is one of my favorites.
4,The Poet,"Love Michael Connelley stories, always intruiging, can't put the book down...Look forward to the next one.....love the connecting stories and characters"
5,Good stuff,"All I have to say is wow! Having started with The Overlook, then Echo Park, both of which I liked so I backtrack and started on this one. This is the best of the three and I'm looking forward to reading more of Connelly's books."
4,Great first Connelly read,"I flew through the twists of this excellent Thriller by Connelly. I was searching for a good summer read, and decided upon The Poet in preparation of reading the Scarecrow. I enjoyed both the writing style, as well as the plot that continues to twist through the last chapters (unpredictably for the most part). Highly recommended."
5,"Connelly's ""The Poet"" a real page turner!","Didn't have this ending figured out. Was a page turner from begining to end. I am now reading ""the Narrows"" just as suspenseful so far. Going to keep Connelly on my must read list!"
3,Connelly's take on Clarice Starling,"It's a Connelly book, and you either like them or you don't. I like them for vacation reading, and it was fun to see the writer do something other than Harry Bosch. Unfortunately he created a loser of a guy (McEvoy), but at least that loser gets to be man-handled by Connelly's take on Clarice Starling, his own Rachel Walling. Yes, Walling is different from Starling - the latter was an orphan. I'm not sure if Connelly wrote an homage intentionally, but if he did I salute him. Good book. The ending has the usual Connelly twist, but this one surprised me a little less than usual...maybe I'm just getting used to the style."
2,"Lots of Unimportant, Unnecessary Characters","The first 100 pages do keep me stay on the book. But after that, 1 or 2 new characters are introduced about every chapter. I start become annoying about memorizing who they are, what they did...etc. The chapters after are just repeating the same incidents, only revising with some more ""facts."" The crime committed by the poet make me feel disguesting and horrible. It is a book annoying me."
1,the poet,"i read other books from Michael Connely and love them,but The poet is very disturbing to me,i had nightmares.the book is too long,i read 70%of the book and i cant read anymore.Sorry is the worst book i ever read"
3,An average read undone by a poor ending,"I've become a big fan of the Harry Bosch series and wanted to see if I liked other books in the Michael Connelly catalog. I was familiar with Jack McElvoy from the Bosch books and wanted to try this one. For me, it was an OK read throughout (a little slow in places), but I was really intrigued by the ending. It made perfect sense and I never saw it coming - until he suddenly shifted gears, came up with an entirely new ending which was not even close to as good as the original one and didn't make sense to me at all. Overall, just a 3."
2,Good story runs out of gas,"For 400 pages, I could not put this book down, then Connelly ruins it with a completely implausible, and ultimately dull ending. The narrator Jack, spends the book searching for the answers to his brother's apparent suicide. The ending gives us the who, but not the more important why or how"
2,Ending wrecked it...,"I thought this book was pretty interesting until the ending. It was so completely over-the-top, contrived, far-fetched, whatever else you want to call it. It tried way too hard and failed big time. It's like he was trying to picture it as a movie and was trying to make a spectacular twist on the twist on the twist...and it was just an eye-rolling inducing obnoxious ending."
3,"Good read, but disappointing","This book definitely kept my interest, but the ending was more than disappointing. I felt almost cheated for having spent my time reading this novel only to arrive at such a badly thought out ending. No motives are given, no true ending, it's as if he got tired of writing the book, just gave it several ""twists"" and ended it there.Bottom line: Disappointing, but interesting enough to keep you turning the pages."
4,Great read,I thought this was an outstanding book with exception to the ending. There were too many unanswered questions about the killer. The killer seemed to be the only one you wouldn't suspect unless you were writing a book and trying to fool readers.The ending definately pulled down an otherwise outstanding read.
3,ending not credible,"This was a teriffic book until the final chapters, when the author tacks on a ""surprise"" ending that is almost entirely disconnected from the body of the novel. It read as if Mr. Connelly had run out of creative steam at that point, but felt the need to add a final twist to the story (an otherwise time-honored device). He takes a fairly well-defined character and completely changes that characterization in the final pages, essentially creating a new character with only the most tenuous link to his/her (I won't give it away) former self. It didn't work for me."
3,"Like, hey, Scoob, I knew who it was all along . . .","The book did not motivate me to write this review so much as Connelly's comments here motivated me to write it.He's rather pompous to believe that criticism of this novel's conclusion is somehow the result of readers who just didn't get what he was trying to do. Readers are smarter than Connelly believes they are, and the ending comes across more like a Scooby Doo plot twist than it does a realistic look at crime, as Connelly wishes to convince us it is.Anyway, I'll give it three stars because it did keep me intrigued until the conclusion when Freddie, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby pulled the mask off the killer. (And he'd have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for that meddling reporter!)"
2,"Promising in places, but, oh, the ending!","Seduced by the rave reviews, I got myself a copy of this. The first 100-odd pages were good and I thought I was on to a winner. Then it started to d-r-a-g, as though the author was under the impression that length equals quality and was cranking up the word-count just to keep the story going. Then the pace picked up again and we came to what I thought was a satisfying conclusion (the scene in the shop) where the baddie was duly unmasked.Not a bit of it! What's this extra chunk of book I see? Why, it's a totally unnecessary (and rather silly) additional twist to the tale, as if the author is trying to show us how clever he's been in fooling us all. Spoiled it. Spoiled it completely. Spoiled whatever merit the book might otherwise have had.This wasn't toying with the reader; it was just plain silly. If this sort of slipshod stuff is typical of Mr Connelly, then I don't see myself wasting time on any of his other books. A shame, because it promised so much."
4,A Little Slow to Get Into but then it Heats Up Nicely!!,"When I first thought about writing a review for ""The Poet"", I wasn't really certain if I liked it that much or not. So, I skimmed through it again and decided on a Four Star rating. The premise is quite good....Introducing a new protagonist is difficult for an established writer like Connelly. This protagonist is a guy with whom you can identify and yet can't quite figure out. The cast of characters is a little thick but if you pay attention, you can sort it all out. There are a few stumbling blocks...areas that are just a bit too implausible, even for a Super-Killer like our ""Poet"" but all in all the story flows nicely from one point to the next. The twist of the plot is pretty creative and only fades a little in the telling. I think that the only thing ""The Poet"" lacks is one more editing session to really smooth out the plot and story line. It is a worthwhile read, something to take on a plane and plan to read both going and coming."
5,A must read for mystery buffs,This was my first Connelly book and what an introduction! I have ordered three more Michael Connelly books. The Poet will keep you spellbound and guessing until the end. The characters are believable and the logic of the story follows even if it has what I consider two endings. A twist that's not a twist but just another ending like he could not decide how to end the book. But still every bit worth the price and the thrilling time you'll have with this book.
5,the poet,absolutely love this book.... i have finally found someone to keep my attention all through out the book....i love michael !!! awesome!!!!!!!!
4,Reader,"I enjoyed the book, but there was no connection between/among characters. I liked the use of Mr. Poe's work. The Fifth Witness surpasses this story."
3,OK but not his best,"I have read several of Michael Connelly's books and this was among the first that I read. After reading ""The Scarecrow"" which is a sequel to the Poet, I went back and read Poet again. I would say that if this is your first Connelly book it is an OK read but the others I have read are better. So if you don't like this one be sure to try another of his books. He is a good writer. His characters are kind of weird to me but the stories are great."
4,A bit generous...,"As others have stated previously, I will not bore you with a synopsis of the story. I wish there was an option for half-star reviews, because I would give this book 3.5 stars, slightly above average. It is an enjoyable read, but somewhat predictable. The ending seems a bit forced and far-fetched. Overall, I would recommend this book, but don't expect anything great from it."
4,Ouch!,"I was all prepared to give this one a 10 but the ending ""bit"" me. The ending just did not jive. Having spent almost 35 years in federal law enforcement, the FBI is just not that good. I do read for entertainment however, so I could overlook some of the fanciful things. I would recommend it to others. On to Trunk Music. I like this author."
5,A good writer writes an good book,"I came across this author/book quite by a lucky accident (I believe this is an oxymoron). In any case, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Apparently, unlike some other reviewers, I like to take my time and savor a good book, make it last as long as possible by reading just a few chapters a day. In any case, I thought THE POET was a great read; I felt that most of the characters were quite well drawn, the book was consistently interesting, it grabbed your attention immediately and kept it. Exciting & unexpected turn near the end when the true ""baddie"" surfaced. I'll be waiting for Mr. Connelly's next book and will also read his Harry Bosch series. More...more...more."
4,A Great Read,"This book was a 'page turner' from the beginning right up to the last page. I agree with the other reviewer who took issue with the ending, but the book was still GREAT anyway! I read it in two days. Couldn't put it down! I will read Michael Connelly's other books now."
3,Excellent right up until the ending,"This book was totally enthralling. I don't usually enjoy suspense thrillers, but this one had me. The first twist at the end was superb, but then the author shoves a different killer into the mix. Why have this second twist (the one that finally reveals all) when the first twist was far more believable and chilling? I devoured this book in one day, relishing in the quality of writing and suspenseful plot, only to have the last few pages leave a bad taste in my mouth."
3,The Poet,Story was great until the plot took an unrealistic turn at the end as the author revealed the identity of the Poet. I felt cheated by this fabrication.
3,Good but fundamentally flawed.,"I like Connelly's work a great deal but in this book and in Truck Music his work as a mytery story teller is flawed. Twists and turns are expected and it's fair game not to let the reader see everything. But in this book he uses two points of view -- first person and third focusing on the suspect we are supposed to believe committed the crime. By only letting us ""see"" these characters and not developing others, he does not create loose ends, much less tie them up. One is unable to achieve the ""yes, that makes sense"" feeling. Lazy or unimaginative plot development. Blood Work, Last Coyote, and Concrete Blonde are much better."
2,Yuk!,"I didn't really find myself getting ""into"" this book. Gruesome violence, including the sick abuse of children, does not in and of itself make for an exciting story. Take out the violence and you're left with a weak, boring novel."
4,Great book,"A great novel. Well plotted, great character development, and like all good reads, it seems to end 100 pages too soon. I would rate it second in my list of favourite serial killer books, after Morton Bain's 'Psychopath!'"
2,Unrealistic,"After reading the forward by Stephen King, I was looking forward to a really good read. Although the book was readable and even exciting at points, when taken in its entirety, it was a disappointment. I found the ending (solving of the mystery) under-developed and when the true killer is revealed the killer's motive was weak as compared to the other possible suspects."
5,Another Michael Connelly Hit,"Michael Connelly's book, The Poet, is realistic and fast-paced, giving us insight about the dark, gritty side of Los Angeles.Beware! Once you start reading Connelly's books you won't want to stop until you've read them all.L. A. Starks, author of 13 Days: The Pythagoras Conspiracy"
4,Chilling and good,"I've enjoyed reading Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch books and it's always a pleasure to read other characters come alive through Connelly's brilliant storytelling. The Poet's ending left me feeling there was something missing concerning some unresolved character's motivations, but it didn't bother me too much. The storytelling was too good.I will say read ""The Poet"" before reading Connelly's ""The Narrows"" which is a sequel that brings Harry Bosch into the fray."
3,Great book until the end...,"This was a very thought out, excellent suspense novel. However, the ending totally blew it. I would have rated this a 5 until the last 40 or so pages. Connelly should have gone with his first idea, not his second. I loved the characterization of the book, althought Jack was weak when it came to women. The story line was very interesting. A killer on the loose, abuses and kills children, then the investigating officers supposedly commit suicide. Jack discovers a pattern and discovers these are homicides not suicides. So he follows the FBI around, unwelcomed. The story progresses nicely and builds up. But when the conflict starts to resolve, it unravels. I was disappointed in the end but I still think it was a good book. I'm still not giving up on Connelly since his Bosch series is fantastic."
3,Unfulfilled potential,"I had been hearing great things about this book for years, so I finally decided to go ahead and read it. I expected it to be much better than it turned out to be. As it started out I was completely enthralled, and thought I was in for a really great story. As the story progressed it began to drag, and there were a few too many far-fetched twists and turns. By the last 1/4 of the book, I had to force myself to keep reading.I'm going to give The Narrows a shot; hopefully it's an improvement."
2,Two Twists Too Many,"The Poet has 425 pages of excellent character development , detail and exicitement... each page drawing you into the suspenseful story line. Problem is: the book has almost 500 pages.In those final 75 pages, Connelly manages to utterly suspend the reader's belief in the plot and the characters. The final chapters are marked by inexplicable, in comprehensible, and improbable twists; a complete lack of coherence; and a failure to tie off loose ends.Call me a cynic, but the ending reads as though an after thought, perhaps prompted by a literary agent seeing a payday in the form of a 3rd rate Hollywood screenplay.It will be a long time before I would entrust another 6 hours of my reading time to Connelly based on this disappointing treatment of his very capable skills."
2,Endings Like This - Nevermore,"This is a good writer. The ending, though, is unnecessarily weak. He serves up a plausible and detailed analysis of why one character could, ultimately, have been the murderer. He then incongruously shifts gears at the eleventh hour. His explanation for why the killer he finally decides on, killed? - ""There's no explanation, Jack ...""There's no excuse - Michael."
2,Plodding along dissappointment,"I feel like I read a different book than many of the other reviewers. A great fan of Baldacci, Grisham, Chrichton, smart writers and surprise twists - this one was a let down. After a foreward by Stephen King, which promises the world - the let down was even worse.I've never read a Connelly book before - and maybe that makes the difference. The concept was good, the writing okay - but it just plodded along (apparently he hasn't heard that old adage about leaving out things that contribute nothing to the story or character development). Hoping for an eventual payoff after all the reviews and blurbs - I forced myself to stick with it. A final thrown-in ""twist"" that had absolutely no rational - was the poor payoff. It was basically a lazy writers ""surprise twist"", one I'd expect from an author if everyone wasn't raving about him. Won't buy another one of his."
2,Serial-killer Novel with a Difference,"Connelly's clear, easy-to-read style enhances the pace of this stellar effort. His hero's flaws and shortcomings are thoroughly believable, and the supporting characters are all plausible. The plotting is tight and the investigative procedures are attention-holding without becoming embedded in minutiae that slow the pace and dissipate the reader's interest.What struck and pleased me most about THE POET is that it's a whodunit rather than the usual serial-killer story in which the reader clearly knows the murderer's identity and sits back to watch him/her play a cat-and-mouse game with the investigators.The bottom line is that this being the first of Connelly's books I've read, I know I'll be reading more in the future. He's that riveting."
2,Predictably Unpredictable,"The Poet makes for decent summer beach reading, but overall I was disappointed by its loopholes and lapses in logic, and most of all by the laughable ending, which attempts to deliver an unexpected twist, but becomes so wildly unpredictable and outrageous that I could no longer hold on to my suspension of disbelief. What attracted me to the novel originally were the references to Edgar Allan Poe, but don't be fooled by the back of the book: the Poe subplot is only a tease, and has nothing to do with the majority of the plot. In other words, don't expect meaningful literary connections ala the film Se7en; Poe's name is used merely to lend credibility to an otherwise silly tale."
3,"Well Written, but hard to read due to subject matter","This book was well written, the characters were well developed and the story line moved at a good pace. The location and the intrigue changed throughout the book and it was very riveting. If I were scoring it on these factors alone, I would have given it a 4 or 4.5.But the subject matter is dark, and I wish I would have realized it before I started reading this. Murder is one thing, but the peek into the mind and lifestyle of pedophelia is something I could live without. In other books and movies, when this subject is mentioned, most of the details are mercifully missing. This book had more detail than it needed and those parts were very disgusting.You should also know that the language is very rough- the most widely used word in the book is the f-word.These latter reasons justify the 3-star rating. The best writers could do better with cleaner language and less graphic realities."
4,First book I've read for years,My lovely wife put me onto this book and I thought it was excellent. Can't wait to start the next one
5,Great Page Turner!,"You will love this book! It is definitely a page turner and there was nights I lost a lot of sleep staying up reading. This is a must read if you like detective novels or thrillers. What I love most about it is its unpredictability, Michael Connelly is a superb author. I also love how the book is so accurate regarding demographics, I live in AZ and Connelly was on point with the description of locations. This is a must read if you are a Connelly fan!"
4,"Excellent, though too many twists!","I thought this was an extremely well-written, exciting page-turner, I literally couldn't concentrate on anything else until I had finished it! The characters were sympathetic and very well drawn. The only flaw, in my opinion, was that there were too many twists at the end, but otherwise this is the best thriller i've read in the last year or two."
4,The Poet,Michael Connelly has always been one of my favorite authors and this one didn't disappoint a bit. What a good writer!
5,Riveting,"I love Michael Connelly's books! Once I start reading, I just cannot put them down.The Poet has such a complete surprise ending."
3,Started Strong but faded... The ending sucked,"Am I the only person who thought the ending of this book sucked? The first 3/4 of the book kept me interested but the plot resolution seemed to come out of nowhere and was not justified at all. It was like the author said ""Hey I'll make this happen - they will never anticipate that!"". For good reason the end was implausable!!"
3,Interesting but stilted,"The most interesting parts of the book were those that dealt with Gladden. Unfortunately, those were also the smallest segments of the book. Someone must have told Michael Connelly that the mark of a good suspense story is never to allow the reader to ""guess"" who the guilty party is. No one could possibly have deducted the identity of the Poet from the information presented by the author. Personally, I prefer to be given four or five possible suspects with motives for each, allowing me to ""play"" detective while I read. If notthat approach, then I like to know who the guilty party is at the onset so I can anticipate his moves and participate with the police in the hunt. I also felt that some of the male-female relationships were very ""stiff"" and unrealsitic as was some of the dialogue between characters. It wasn't a ""bad"" story, it just had a lot more potential that wasn't realized"
3,Why that ending ?,"From page one, this cat and mouse chasing grabbed me by the lapels and did not let me go because the story was solid, fast paced,unpredictable and coming developments were difficult to figure out. As other readers I did not like the ending because it was shook with too many twists and the last one, unrealisitic, came out of nothing unveiling the culprit without any logical base to substantiate it, ....simply just turn some facts upside down and thats it..., nevertheless for the most part I recognize that the whole plot was very well told."
4,A MUST READ,"THIS WAS MY FIRST, BUT DEFINETLY NOT MY LAST CONNELLY NOVEL. DEFINETLY A PAGE-TURNER FROM START TO FINISH. I FOUND IT VERY EASY TO FOLLOW THE PLOT WHILE CONNELLY SHARES GRAPHIC DETAILS AND SUBTLE CLUES ABOUT A KILLER ON THE LOOSE. MANY READERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE BOOKS CONCLUSION, BUT I FOUND IT QUITE INTERESTING. I HAVE FOUND A NEW AUTHOR TO FOLLOW IN MY PURSUIT OF CRIME-THRILLERS."
2,Contrived and complicated,"A group of friends selected this book for a monthly book club and only two could bear to finish it. We all agreed that the story was entirely too contrived and the text not especially well-written. The ending would have been more plausible if it had stopped at naming the female agent as the culprit. Her personal history made it more likely. By making it on the older agent, it appears as if at the last minute an editor decided it would too unpopular for the female to be the murderer, and the author just added on to the end. It would have been a better novel had it ended with the female."
2,"Going in the ""donate"" pile","Luckily, this was not my first Connelly book, or I wouldn't bother to read any others. I know he writes a better book. This one was engaging up until the end, at which point Connelly must have put his manuscript aside for awhile, then realized that he was about to miss a deadline so shot off a few final twists and chunked it to his editor. The ending is so contrived it could have been cribbed from a high school English paper.Additionally, in the edition that I have there are so many typos and grammatical errors that it became distracting to read, and leads me to think Connelly has become a book-a-year writer, and isn't putting in that much effort."
4,"Good, but give me Harry","I liked this book on tape, but it was less fun to have a reporter as the hero. One thing that was quite disappointing, however, is that when I started to read reviews before I bought this tape, I saw a posting from Michael Connelly that said ""Don't read this if you plan to buy the book"". So I didn't, but now that posting is gone. I was quite interested about what he had to say about the ending.I'm not sure I can stand the wait until Harry Bosch comes back in January."
4,"Poet is good, but there are better","I picked up The Poet after having already read James Patterson's Kiss the Girls, and the novels by Thomas Harris. This was a mistake. Connelly tries hard to make the book interesting with plenty of twists, and for the most part he succeeds. It doesn't move along until after 100 pages, but after that, The Poet is a rollercoaster read with interesting characters and plenty of diversions. I believe that it is the villain that makes or breaks a suspense novel. That is where this book falters. I didn't find the Poet to be interesting enough as a villain. He is barely heard from at all, and his identity is unrealistic. This is why I would suggest you read anything by Harris or the one by Patterson if you would like a real feel for the genre. The Poet is good, but not great."
5,Michael Connelly is amazing!,"I have read this book and BLOOD WORK and I am eager now to dive into the Harry Bosch books. THE POET is meticulously plotted, totally involving, and impossible to put down. I am beginning to like Connelly more than Jeffrey Deaver, which I thought would not be possible. This is the sort of book that you want to finish because it is so gripping, but you are so sorry when the book is over because you want to stay enthralled. Read this one for sure!"
2,Who Is This Guy?????,"Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors, hands down. But boy it sure matters who (whom?) you get to read these books because the guy who read this, Buck Schirner - in a word - STINKS!!!! He has a very deep voice, which is fine, but probably more suited to horror or porn stories, or even as a sports announcer. And he does not sound sincere throughout this book. His voice does not fit the character. I utilize lots of audio books, especially mysteries/legal thrillers/detective stories, and this is the first time I've had this reaction. I assumed the story is what sells - but boy was I wrong!! It took me FOREVER to get through this. And then I ordered the book just so I can see if I missed anything. So if you like Michael Connelly, most of his audio books are terrific but stay away from this particular one. I only gave it two stars because of the author."
5,These Stockpots are the best.,"This is my third one I have purchased.They are very well made with a lifetime waranty.I use them for canning tomatoes.For years I used the Stanless ones but they wear out fast.These ones will not burn through nor will the finish crack.These are very well made.Oh, they are also very easy to clean."
3,Forget the name,"Good pot. Not bulletproof Le Creuset. Kind of reminds me of a ""value line"" that manufacturers put out sometimes. The stay looking good outside, use kid gloves inside. Easy for the sauces/ soups to stick if not careful. Ours is 3-4 years old with minimal usage. Like our stainless better."
1,Not up to their cast iron quality,I purchased this thinking that it would match the quality of my Le Creuset dutch oven...Not even close..The bottom is almost completely chipped away. I would not recommend this to anyone.
4,"Great, but very very boring","This book is great, but I think it is really boring and sometimes can really make you fall asleep."
2,"boring, not great",I am a student and have been using Vocabulary Workshop for two years. I find it very boring doing the same thing over and over again. Most of the words I don't remember and have to look back at definitions for the tests and the review sections.
2,I been using Vocabulary for 4 years now!,"I am a student at Ridgewood High School in West Lafayette, OH. These books has unique words in then, but we never use them because we never heard of them before. It's just a waste of time. Most people copy off another students, only few STUDENTS learn from them."
3,3 solid tracks to download,The three B+ tracks are: 1) Joss Stone & Sting; 2) Peter Frampton (unfairly neglected in all the other customer reviews) and 3) Jeff Beck. Get 'em and enjoy - Les would!
2,disappointed,this album is not the one you want. The other Les Paul and Friends has a better selection of songs. I thought because the title is the same on both albums that they would have the same songs. Not.
4,Deserves at least 4 stars,"For all you folks [reviewers] who were disappointed by this cd: LIGHTEN UP! The album is simply not what you hoped/expected it might be. The presentation as ""Les Paul and Friends"" was misleading as the music does not focus on the guitar playing of Les in a polite easy going way. Instead what you get is a fresh and well recorded collection of some truly great rock and R&B. Les himself strongly approved of the result of this collaboration. Get this cd and crank it up!"
1,A Real Mess!,"Another all star tribute disaster. I love Les but am really sorry I spent money on this. He's so buried under all of those other players that I wonder if he's really there at all! He is but, a couple of brief solos don't do the master justice. Skip this and get his 40's and 50's recordings. Most of these artists probably still think Les Paul is just the name of a guitar! A worthless pre-fabricated project."
1,Where's Les?,"Not enough of Les... I've been a fan of his for 40 years. He deserves a better tribute album than this! It would be nice if it were all people who played the guitar with his namesake during their careers also!! The one nice thing was Steve Miller being included. A little history I read years ago is Les taught Steve to play the guitar!! COOL!! If I remember correctly, Steve Miller's father worked at Capitol Records and that's how Steve got connected with Les. Miller being on the album is the only plus for me. I love Les's playing and just don't hear it on this album. Like other's have said, I'd like to hear some of his shows from his gig every Monday night in NYC. You want to really here Les?? Go find some old 78's like I did when I was a teenager!!Being a guitar player myself I knew who he was when I was a kid. I didn't appreciate him until I was in my 20's and I think he deserves more than this!! He's a national treasure at the very least!!!!!!!"
2,An old timer,"Growing up, I watched the the 15 min Les Paul/Mary Ford Show on TV (and have their CD's), and admittedly bought this CD. Where is Les Paul? There are some good tunes, but the info on the CD where he actually plays is suspect. Buy for the tunes not for Les Paul."
2,american made world played,The CD sent to me was defective.The final two tracks would not play.The surface of the cd was scrathed.
1,where's Jimmy?,"What?? A Les Paul tribute without Jimmy Page? You must be joking! If Jimmy were in on the sessions, he would've made sure there was more Les!"
3,In defense of Sambora...,"I just need to write this to clarify something. I am no fan of Richie Sambora, but his inclusion on this disc is really the one that make a ton of sense. Les Paul himself has said many a times that the only modern guitarist he actually considers really good is Sambora. They have become good friends through the years. There should be no surprise that one of Pauls favorite guitarists is included, and if anything it shows just how honest of a ""tribute"" this CD is."
2,where is les?,"This is just a jam album by assorted guitar greats. Les barely is noticed. And like some one else wrote, what do these fender players have to do with les. How about all the players that helped make his instrument famous. The other reveiws that think this is a great tribute album are misguided. Do not waste your money on this one."
5,Easy to use and works so good I now have two.,"I ordered this to examine coins. Since I have poor eyesight, I could not read the dates and mint marks of most coins. This is one of the best magnifying glasses I ever used. Set the coin, stamp, paper, etc down on a flat surface. Place the glass on top. You don't not need to hover the glass, just set it down. If the angle is not perfect, it's okay, you can still read what you need to. There is no attempts to focus, find the light, etc. This just works."
4,Good,This works fine. I have a different one that doesn't have a domed bottom like this one and looking through seems sharper.But this works well and will even magnify a little more when you pull it away from the paper like a traditional magni fire.I still prefer the flat bottom one because you can place it against anything like a prescription bottle.
4,A collection of useful articles,"This is not exactly bed-time reading (I tried), but many of the articles are well written. Most of them contain useful stuff and I hope to get around to implementing and testing some of the ideas. If you are interested in computational aspects of Comparative Genomics, then this book is a must."
5,Good story but no details or how to,This book tells the personal story of someone who was starting out in the business and what he did wrong. The appendix is a good source of information but you still want your lawyers to look at your own agreements etc. The writers wrote this book did not clearly give you step by step information but it was an interesting read.
1,Building Big Profits in Real Estate: A Guide for The New Investor (Paperback),"This book is absolutely horrible. Not worth the time reading and certainly not worth the money. Approximately 30% of the books is forms, including rental appications, leases etc. There are too many other good book out there than to consider this one.Consider books from the Rich Dad's Advisors"
5,The finest example of the galaxy's favorite droid!,"The ultimate plastic example of everyone's favorite droid! c-3po has been loved by fans for almost three generations now. and with many different incarnations of this figure, this is by far the best. hasbro went all out on this one. capturing his likeness to a ""T"". he has more articulation than any other version made. making his $10 price tag (almost double any other figure) worth the cost. he is also carded on a faithfully reproduced vintage style 1980 era card! and he comes with a protective star case to keep him mint for many years. cant afford, or even track down the vintage version of this great reissue? get this very hard to find version (I have yet to see him in stores, and they are done shipping these!) now, before they sell out, and they will fast!"
4,Excellent introduction to popular data mining tools,"Enjoyed the scope of data mining topics covered by this book. One gets a good understanding of how today's popular data mining technology works without getting bogged down in the mathematical detail. Also, found the reference sections, web site referrals and case studies very helpful. Unfortunately, most of the demos included on the attached CDROM did not work for a variety reasons. Spoke with the author about this problem and he is working on providing up to date product demos via a central web site rather than relying on the attached CDROM. In summary it's still a solid introductory text for anyone interested in data mining."
4,An excellent introduction to data mining technology,"This book is an excellent one for gaining an understanding data mining technology without getting mired in the mathematics of the topic. It not only gives you insight into what data mining is, but how it may be useful to your business. The reference sections, web site referrals and case studies are very helpful. Unfortunately, the CD-ROM is out of date, however, the author is in the process of an update that would fix that problem. Once the author completes the update of this book with a web site rather than a CD-ROM, I would have no qualms about rating this as a 5 star book."
3,Saxon is good if you've learned it from the beginning...otherwise it's too hard.,"My child learned with another math curriculum and then had Saxon Math in the 7th grade. It was VERY difficult and further ahead then she had learned so far in other Pre-Algebra books. So, if you're going to do the Saxon Math books, I suggest you start with the earlier grades and progress that way naturally. The transition of trying to jump in and learn Saxon for the first time when you're a 7th grader is way too hard."
5,Fantastic Curriculum!!!,"Difficult to begin with, as we were compensating for years of public schooling. After two or three weeks, we covered most of the basic lack of competence and she is now progressing nicely. In an ideal world, we would have begun homeschooling from the beginning and there would not have been any ""catch up"". I cannot imagine her being confused about any concept taught in this text. Occasionally it is tedious in its repetitiveness, but it is very, very thorough. She is in sixth grade this year, but I am confident that she will begin Saxon Math Algebra 1 next year."
5,"Not good,But NEW!!!","Although it says its Good as its overall review for the book quality,THIS BOOK LOOKS,FEELS,AND IS BRAND NEW!!!!LOVE IT!!!!This book is the same exact thing as the ones you get in school."
4,Cute sticker,This was a cute sticker for my teenage cousins 16th bday. It looks like graffitti and were vivid colors.
2,Look good..............,"These say they will fit 25 to 35 waist, but they are VERY small. So can not say more as can not wear them to try them out. BUT they do look good."
2,Carl Weathers as Lando Carlrissian,"Well, let me tell you that I have always wanted ""Lando"" for the simple reason that ""he"" and Han Solo are long time ""Buds"" BUT I have never had the opportunity to obtain him. The one that is shown in the image is NOT the one I recieved. I ended up with the ""Power of the Force"" version were Lando has apparently been taking steroids or something because he is so muscle-bound that even though he is fully clothed you can still see all his muscles thru his outfit. He resembles more Carl Weathers from the ""Rocky"" films than Billy Dee Williams. It's not a bad ""action figure"" it's just that's not what I was looking for. I gave this a decent score simply because you can see that even in toyland there is ""pressure"" to fit the mold of other companies figures (""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" anyone?)."
1,Peg warmer of Star Wars VOTC,This figure still sits on the shelf - even after VOTC was discontinued. It was a boring and uninterresting figure. Hasbro should have continued to focus on the Stormtrooper and would have made collectors very happy.
3,corpse bride actoin figures,I just got a 3 set with emily victor and scraps. they are good quality and I'd expect that of other figures. victoria looks like a fairly good quality figure.(how do you get the vause in her hand? >.<)
1,McFarlane's toys are for LOOKING ONLY! No play value.,"My 7 year old son has many, many action figures. We purchased McFarlane's Corpse bride figures as well as the Nightmare Before Christmas figures. ALL FIGURES HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PLAY VALUE AT ALL!!! My son is very gentle, and likes to pose most of the toys, but each time you try to pose anything on these dolls it BREAKS. Yes, they are gorgeous, exact replicas of the movie characters, but once you get them out of the box - if you can do so without breaking them in the process - they have to sit."
4,A comic book for girls,"My 11-year old daughter absolutely loves this book. She describes it as ""a comic book, but good!!!"" She can't wait for more to be published. I think the photos are a bit strange (the characters don't look like how I expected them to), but she has read it over and over again happily."
3,Mixed feelings as an adult about a children's book,"Overall a lovely tale about a scheming wayward young man determined to ""live off the best of the land"" and not lift a finger to do so. He finds himself in quite a pickle as his own deception of the king threatens his career as ""Royal Cook"". Great illustrations and storyline - much enjoyed as a child. As an adult, a little older and wiser, I find that the stereotypes used in the book are a little hard to take. The obese king can ONLY think about food and plans his whole day around his meals and snacks. The busty wenches sit giggling on the cook's knee. Not so sure I want my kids to have those kinds of things reinforced so I feel I have to talk to them about other ideas regarding the words used and pictures. Overall a good story if you're not too sensitive about being politically correct!"
5,Fun & Pretty,Pugster was very helpful in getting this mood charm to me ... get one for yourself ... you'll enjoy it!
1,I wouldn't recommend this program,"After seeing the video demo I thought this was the right choice. I was wrong. Once you actually play it, Rosettastone Chinese is just a bunch of old pictures linked to a soundtrack. You hear sounds and you are supposed to pick the right picture. Eventually you get the hang of it but I can't really say anything in Chinese, and I don't really know what anything means. I'm a disciplined learner and I've been at it, but no one can honestly tell me they can learn with this program. There are some writing exercises but they don't make much sense. The voice recognition doesn't work at all. I really thought this was going to work but the demo has nothing to do with Rosetta Chinese. I'm disappointed and I feel cheated."
4,Best I found to date,"Rosetta Stone V2: Chinese, Level 1 & 2 [OLD VERSION]This is the best I have found so far; however this has a problem and there are improvements that could be helpful.The section under Skill ""D"" in which you attempt to mimic a native speaker's visual of their sound by recording your voice & visual does not work well. I tried and failed so I asked my Chinese wife who is a native speaker to try. She is from Bejing and lived in Taiwan. She speaks Mandarin both ways meaning she uses the ""R"" sound in China and drops it in Taiwan. She tried numerous times and could not get out of the red failing zone. Something is wrong!One improvement would be that a dictionary of some type be provided from Pin Yin to English. My wife reads both the traditional & current characters now used in China, she is my dictionary but what about the person without a Chinese spouse?"
4,DB2 software on CD-ROM expired Nov 2004,"So far the book itself looks good, but the trial version of IBM DB2 on the CD-ROM expired in Nov of 2004 according to page 611 (conveniently not mentioned on the book cover). The artwork on the CD-ROM itself claims that the CD-ROM has a trial version of MS SQL Server 2000 but if it is on there I can't find it.IBM does have a trial version of DB2 available for download from their website."
2,"Gives you branches, not even trees, let alone the forest","This book is very poorly written. It has a lot of technical details on three flavors of SQL implementation as well the SQL99 standard, but is totally light on general concepts. It tells you how to do something (but often in a convoluted way), but doesn't say why or for what purpose. There's also a lot of circular references which can drive the reader nuts. I do not like this book at all."
4,All pupose SQL manual,"This text will continue to age well and be a serviceable reference for the several strands of SQL dialects covered (Oracle, SQL Server, DB2), as well as serving as a general text for any other SQL dialect. As readable as it is comprehensive. Large but not padded with guff."
3,SQL Bible review,This book came highly recommended from a colleague and I find it very useful as a good reference book. I would recommend this book for anyone working with different databases or a student learning the concepts.I was really disappointed with the packaging that I received this book in. It was poorly packaged. One end of the box was open. The book had been damaged as a result of poor packaging. Amazon has been my go to place for reference books and text books. I am now reconsidering this.
3,Adequate for the Money,"The book was a great value for the money I paid. The list price, on the back of the jacket, is about four times higher than what I actually paid Amazon. The book arrived about a week after I ordered it via US Mail. The only complaint I have about the quality is the paper. They used a high acid content paper, so my finger tips feel dry and rough after I read it for a while. The copyright is 2008, so it is still OK for a computer book.I haven't had it long enough to be the perfect judge of it's content. I use it as a reference, so I don't use it every day. It does cover both Oracle 11 and SQL Server 2008 like I need. Kriegel and Trukhnov covered a lot of ground in one book. I expect it will have what I need."
3,An advance user's book,"Only if you've already done some elementary courses about sugar flowers, otherwise this book is difficult for you. Have pictures showing the appearance of how the flowers are done but the description is not as straight forward. Ideas are good though!"
4,Cedric Myton shines,"The previous reviewer does a good job of braking down the situation that characterizes the conception, recording, and acceptance of this album by The Congos. However, despite Lee Perry's absence from the controls, I consider this a very underrated album that deserves a careful listen. Cedric Myton is well known for his near-flawless falsetto and it is showcased here along with more traditional voicings in a way that fascinates me as a listener. He effortlessly shifts back and forth between singing styles from one verse to the next and sometimes even in the same line. Songs like ""Jackpot,"" ""Hail The World of Jah,"" ""Days Chasing Days,"" and ""Thief Is In The Vineyard"" are exceptional and the others aren't bad either. While ""Heart Of The Congos"" is essential to any reggae collection, this album is worth buying if you are interested in the next best effort from a legendary artist. If Lee Perry had produced it, I imagine that it could have rivaled its predecessor."
4,Editorial review somewhat misleading,"Both the editorial review and ""Braveheart"" make an error about the concept of ""ius primae noctis."" A feudal lord never, in the folklore, was thought to have such a right in regard to one of his vassals (a lesser noble who held a fief from him, or a knight). Wallace being a noble, his bride would not have been subjected to such a custom, even if it had existed. Even in legend, this supposed ""right"" was limited in the popular imagination to the brides of unfree serfs."
5,Not really for undergraduates,"The claim by Book News that this is abook addressed to undergraduates is just plain wrong. In fact, this book is even difficult forthe average graduate student. The title `BasicAlgebra' might be at the root of this misundestanding.This is a classic book and astandard reference for abstract algebra ata relatively advanced level."
1,Not so very basic,I bought both the Basic Algebra I and II in order to help my grandson review algebra before trying to go to college. Both of these books are far advanced for a basic math course. They are totally unsuited for my purposes. They read like one of those government technical seminars where everyone falls asleep. This book is only useful if you are already a math nerd.
4,An Edifying Collection,"This collection consists of a short commentary for each book of the Bible, written by a variety of long-dead preachers and theologians ranging from John Calvin to John Wesley. The diversity of contributors means disputes can be found throughout, and no one could possibly agree with every view set forth. But the book as a whole is edifying and quite useful.It must be noted that much of the book's content is already available online for free -- the (many) commentaries by Wesley and by Matthew Henry, for instance, along with the Jamieson/Fausett/Brown commentaries. But not all of it is online -- J.C. Ryle's commentary on Luke is wonderful, and (so far as I know) not easily located elsewhere. Before you buy this book, review the table of contents and compare it with what's available online and in your personal library."
2,Armani falls short,"This Armani sport watch looks great until you get it. Big and bold, but the chrystal is the failure. It is convex and very shiny so from any angle it has glare. So much that you cannot see the time very well.It also makes the watch look like a cheaper imitation.I sent mine back because of this issue. I have other Armani watches and have been quite happy with them, but this one was disappointing."
3,Fifty-fifty,"The band had its best years in the early 90's but this album should make their name for the year 2000. It's a typical 24-7 Spyz album with some heavy funkmetal and some ballads, some good songs and some that you skip. I'll say that 50% of the album is worth listening more than once. The input from King's X frontman Doug Pinnick is certainly a upside to the album. Maybe they ought to do some more cooperations in the future?"
5,Genius mix of soul and heavy metal!,"I've been a fan of 24-7 Spyz since I first heard them around 1992. This cd is incredible! The Spyz can combine heavy metal and soul like no other. One listen to this cd and you won't be able to deny it. I agree completely with another reviewer about the possitive impact of Doug Pinnick's (of King's X) input. I can't describe this music in words. Just listen to it. They definitely have a style all their own. If you like this cd I also recommend ""Strength In Numbers"", ""Harder Than You"", and ""This Is Twenty-Four-7 Spyz"" (all by 24-7 Spyz).Unfortunately these are not always easy to find. Good luck!Note: ""6"" & ""Heavy Metal Soul By The Pound"" contain nearly an identical song list except each has two songs that the other does not:- ""6"" contains ""7 and 7 Is"" & ""Along Comes Mary""- ""Heavy Metal Soul By The Pound"" contains ""Earth and Sky"" & ""Save the World"""
5,Perfect Romantic Suspense thriller!,"Lori Derby Bingley has supplied us with a wonderful story of greed, lust, and murder. Join that with a love story between two people who have to learn to trust again, and you have the best story of this decade. Perfect for 'Movie of the Week', Ms Bingley's twists and turns kept me guessing right up until the end as to who the killer was, and the motives behind it. Plan your day accordingly, because once you pick this up, you won't be able to put it down!"
2,Dry Rotted Pages,"I was disappointd because the book was advertised as being in very good condition, but is actually very old with near dry rotted pages. I might add that all of my other experiences with Amazon have been pleasing."
3,Binding ripping,I was not too happy with the pages showing some tearing at the binding when opening for the very first time.
3,Suitable,Not high enough in back to support 8 x 10 sheets. We didn't realize it is primarily designed for stiff tri-folds. Decent quality.
2,Something to Keep on the Nightstand,"Lamm and Couzens provide some useful information on the so-called ""potency pill,"" which claims to address the physical causes of male impotence. The authors never discuss, however, the feelings of inadequacy that usually perpetuate the problem. Those suffering from performance anxiety should consult additional readings."
5,I love this kettle!,"I was really suprised about all the negative reviews about this kettle. My husband gave me one as a gift and it is beautiful and functional. Perhaps some people need to review the instructions that came with the kettle. IF you follow the instructions you won't have any problems with the kettle overflowing, or being to heavy to pour. Removing the whistle is easy if you use an oven mitt or a kitchen towel (as suggested in the instructions.) The whistle make a plesant sound, which is a plus. I think this kettle lives up to the Le Creuset name."
2,"Cute, Sturdy but it will rust",I've owned this kettle for about a year and a half. Enamel will rust even with the best of care. I had hopes because of Le Creuset's quality it would last for years. I would not recommend this product.
2,"Looks nice, but...","I received this kettle as a wedding gift and was very happy with it, at first. While it looks very nice, it is too high maintenance. It rusts if not left completely dry and the finish chips off too easily. Also, the whistling attachment can be difficult to remove, especially since it is hot (but it's also a pain to pop it back in to place). And, if you lose or break the whistling piece, the kettle is no longer a whistling kettle. Who knew a tea kettle could be such a hassle? I returned this and got the Oxo Uplift tea kettle instead. I am MUCH happier with this one."
1,"Not up to ""Le Creuset"" standard...","I am a major fan of ""Le Creuset"" pots and have a number of them but I must say that their kettle is not up to par.Like the other lady said, it does spit out water (substantially at that) when it boils on the stove. I am finally throwing mine out to the garbage since I have had it for a while and the coating at the inside bottom of the kettle is coming apart and I have been boiling ""contaminated"" water since a while...I just noticed one day that there was this stuff floating on top of the water....I wonder what kind of chemicals I have been putting in my body???"
4,function and design,"We have enjoyed using the tea kettle, but have removed the whistler as it is hard to pour with otherwise and difficult to remove when hot. The styling is nice and very funtional. We've never had a whistling kettle before so it has not been a big deal for us."
5,Ezekiel's Vision,"Ezekiel's Vision is a must read, it's so suspenseful that I could not put this book down until I finished. It's timeliness in view of today's events is so uncanny that I am now believer in Ezekiel's Vision.Ezekiel's Vision is a must movie."
1,Not Iron and Below Usual Le Creuset Quality,"I've used it and sent it back. My iron Le Cruset products are great. This one, made of steel and coated with enamel, started chipping on the exterior and interior after only one month of use. I was not impressed."
2,performance worse than looking,"I ordered this one as my first purchase of Le Creuset products, and it was way below my expectation. The enamel coating looks pretty but is very hard for cleaning. Even my soup ingredients sticked to the bottom and I had to scrub really hard to get rid of it. I will stick to my Calphalon nonstick saucepan from now on."
1,Chips terribly!,"We purchased the enamel on steel stockpot and used it about six months. We noticed that the outside chipped a couple of times for no apparent reason. Then last night after making a pot of vegetable soup, I saw that BIG chunks of the enamel has chipped off on the interior of the pot! We paid about $50 for the stockpot, and it only lasted six months! That's a MAJOR RIP OFF!We have used one of LeCreuset's enameled iron pans for years, and truly love it. However, their enamel on steel is HORRIBLE. I wouldn't waste my money on their stockpot again!"
5,Quadivator scraper/leveler,"I could not beleive when I found this product on Amazon.com. I've been looking for this attachment for my Quadivator for some time. When it arrived, and it arrived very quickly, I was surprised that it was improved upon from the model I had purchased about 9 years ago. The price was great and now I can scrape all the weeds from my 5 acre yard with ease again. I am going to purchase another replacement blade for my Quadivator just in case that I do not find this product again. Thanks Amazon for suppling these odd ball products."
5,Wonderful Southern book,"I don't even know how to begin to say how much I enjoyed this book. How does one describe Inny, who seems to be just evil, and sometimes she really is. But why? Maybe she is the way she is because of the way life has treated her. Things that happened that she never told her family. I found myself crying for her & wishing that her family could understand why she did the things that she did & why she acted towards people in such a detestible way. Just read this book."
1,tedious and redundant,"This book was a chore to finish. I don't think I have ever encountered any character that was less likely to evoke any sympathy even when you were given the reasons for her evilness. The main character, Aunt Inny,(Aunt Inny, Aunt Inny, Aunt Inny...over and over and OVER!!!) had absolutely no redeeming qualities and neither does this book. It is a dark, profane and hateful book."
1,Big disappointment,"These shoes fell apart the very first time my daughter (8-years-old) wore them. The cute diamond-y charm fell off and the stitching along the top of the shoe completely unraveled, making them unwearable. We also had another pair of Little Laundry shoes that did the same thing (they became totally unstitched) and I won't buy their products anymore, no matter how deeply discounted they are."
2,"its ok, but not for beginners","This book is ok, but not really for a beginner, I think that if you really want to learn how to read and write Arabic I have seen many other books that are much better on the market, but this book is like a quick refrence book, not really a book to teach yourself anything. I did learn a few words, but very limited to what I can say from reading this book. I have been told I am also not pronouncing the words correctly, I learned the words from the phonetic words next to the arabic words in this book. Like I said great refrence, but not a serious way to teach yourself arabic."
2,Berlitz goes to pieces,"Although the tape is useful (once you get past the loud intro) the book is of poor construction. The pages fell out only three days after buying the book. This is a problem, as every time I use the book I have to piece it together afterwards. My advice is to buy a real book such as one of the ""Teach Yourself ..."" series. They cost only a little more and are better constructed."
4,Before there was Smooth Jazz....,"....there was John Klemmer. Talk about transcending a genre, especially when it didn't exist yet!. Klemmer sets up the mellow grooves that we have come to associate with smooth jazz. But there are no cliche blues licks, none of the [...] that players in this genre try to foist upon as as ""hip"" . Indeed, Klemmer has more in common with the late 60's mantra playing of Coltrane or Sanders than...those other guys (whose names will not be mentioned.) This is music straight from the heart, smooth but with a few twists and turns to make it interesting. And look who the sidemen are: Chuck Domanico, Chuck Rainey, Joe (not Jeff!) Porcaro, John Guerin, not to mention Emil Richards and Don Grusin on keys. .In short, an A list of studio cats playing it so sweetly.And yes, this may be the greatest make out album ever. Brings back fond memories.""Nuff said. Buy it. It still sounds great!"
5,Touched,"I was 'touched' by this compilation while stationed in the Vietnam-era Navy at Bremerton, WA in '76; wonderful place to contemplate so profound a sax masterpiece; words can't describe the joy of those times, they may never occur again; John, you gave us a once-in-a-lifetime experience!!! My only regret is that I took SO LONG to acknowledge your impossibly amazingly ahead-of-it's-time contribution to jazz music..."
5,"Touch, John Klemmer",Wonderful sound that reminds me of the days gone by. The tunes on this albumn were played on the radio constantly. I had not heard any of these tunes in at least twenty years. It was a pleasing romp in the past.
2,"Interesting, but not really well enough written.","John Barrow's most recent book has a lot of interesting ideas, but it is pretty hard to read -- even for people well versed in the area. If it were better written or edited, the hard concepts he puts across would make it through to the reader. But there are a lot of interesting ideas, and if you can make it through to the end, the last chapter ties things together fairly well. One would best read the chapter summaries and the final chapter, then read the rest for the details."
4,Philosophy rather than science,"This book surprised me in that it was more about philosophy than science or mathematics. Somehow (was it the blurb or the title?) I expected this book to be a complement or development of the ideas in Rudy Rucker's 'Infinity and the Mind', or som3e of the works of Raymond Smullyan. But it shied away from technical aspects in preference to more general exposition. I thought, on starting the book, that I might have learned more about those mathematicians who work without reference to differential or integral calculus because of underlying difficulties in the rationale for using limits in analysis. However, I did enjoy the book and it did have insights that interested me."
2,Confusing and overworked.,"Barrow's book Impossibility is a turgid and confused affair, with great ideas but no real focus as to the way they are presented. It is disappointing compared to his previous work, Pi in the Sky. The chapters seems to have nothing definite to say or alternatively stumble around the main idea. Definitely a book that will be left partially unread."
2,Never actually said anything,I gave up reading this. It kept meandering around and was not clear what it was trying to say. After 50% of the way through it still felt like I was reading the introduction
3,The End of Science,"This work is informative, but far less profound/informative/entertaining (in my opinion)than the easily read/understood ""opus"" by John Horgan entitled....""The End of Science."""
2,One great song. One very good song. That's it.,"""My Boyfriend is a Genius"" is unabashedly and unequivocably great. ""Wannabee"" is very very good. The rest is so-so: marred by too similar musical ideas and limited, fairly annoying vocals. She's got some good lyrics, though. But by all means get a copy of ""My Boyfriend is a Genius."" A genius single."
5,A startlingly original voice from the underground,"I couldn't believe my ears: this is the kind of artist encountered rarely, by night, at a friend's house, on a night to change your life. So many ""New York"" singers lack songs that I almost gave up: but Julia's voice, while secure and even strident, is simply the Money Train that delivers her masterful songs. Each one is a sun-blasted gem (particularly ""Thank You"" and ""Boyfriend"") -- thoughtful, frightening, whimsical, hungry. She's a special talent and I'm glad to have ""met"" her. May she live long and prosper."
3,No bonus track on CD.,I ordered this and the back cover indicates there's supposed to be a 10th (bonus) track. But there's none actually on the CD. Anyone know what the deal is? I scanned and uploaded the back cover to customer images so you can see for yourself.
1,Not worth the money!,"I'm very disappointed with this lamp. The description states that the shade is ""Art Glass"", but it is plastic, and there were chips and scratches on the plastic shade. The Knurl Nut (shade post) screwed out of the Harp (shade holder) the first time I detached the shade. The lamp is made in China; not stated in the description. I paid $79.20; not worth it."
4,Good music,Joe Walsh is a legend and albums like this are why. fun and meaningful. It is always a pleasure to listen to his light hearted lyrics.
5,YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH JOE,"ONE OF JOE'S BEST ALBUMS, EVERY TRACK IS GREAT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE AWESOME SHM AUDIO FORMAT. MUST HAVE FOR ANY CD COLLECTION, BUT DON'T PAY THESE RIDICULOUS OVER-INFLATED RIP OFF PRICES, I BOUGHT MINE FROM THE MUSIC SPECIALIST ON E BAY, SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF CASH.CHEERS!"
4,here is a real review,"This is a great live CD that shows exactly what Joe Walsh was up to... He and the band are excellent and as far as the comments here that these songs are not as textured as the original recordings, well, duh - it's an f-ing live album.Just a note about the other reviews here. The guy who thought this was recorded with the Eagles is just plain daffy. Don Henley and Glen Frey did do vocals on the original version of Turn To Stone, but not on this live record. The other reviews are by a bunch of geeks who probably never saw Walsh live back in his heyday. As a high schooler I saw Walsh on this tour and later with the Eagles. I will defer to my friend Ron, who after seeing the revamped Eagles commented that two great bands had now become one mediocre mess - later finishing his diatribe with the statement...If you like live records this one rocks. Play it loud!"
2,"Avoid, Will Robinson, avoid, avoid! Lousy audio ahead!","OK, sorry for the ""Lost in Space"" intro, but seriously folks, avoid this. The audio quality is horrible, and unlike other live releases, it's neither been remastered nor has any ""bonus material"" been added. This is, and it sounds like it, first-generation CD audio from the 1980s. It deserves to be remastered and expanded. Until then, the best Joe Walsh (audio-wise) is either ""Look What I Did"" (a two-CD best of) or ""Little Did He Know..."" (a less comprehensive, but more cohesive best-of). For now, The Smoker You Drink and all the other Barnstorm-era Joe Walsh is in dire need of remastering and I wouldn't buy any of it until Joe (or his label) gets around to cleaning up the muddy sound that was so common with first-generation compact discs."
4,A nice concert souvenir,"Not too used to seeing a six-track CD, are you?Well, Joe could've certainly have found room for one or two more songs, but this album is from the age of the LP, after all, and three of these six songs are over seven minutes long.The sound on this live album is very good, and Joe Walsh plays with energy and conviction. He is in good form vocally as well, and he lays down a great, bluesy solo on ""Meadows"" and plays searing slide guitar on ""Rocky Mountain Way"".The songs flow smoothly, starting off with a powerful ""Walk Away"", and closing with a majestic, eight-minute rendition of the epic ""Turn To Stone"". And in between you'll find a great lesser-known song, the rocking ""Time Out.This fine live recording has lots of feeling, great sound, great songs, and it is a worthy addition to any Joe Walsh-collection, even if you're not an ardent fan and perhaps only own a compilation or two, or maybe a couple of his solo albums."
3,You can argue with flaccid arrangements,"Great songs, but they are rendered less powerful here than their studio antecedents by the new instrumentation and arrangements. No doubt calculated to keep up with the rock Joneses, the disco-shuffle perversion of Walk Away leads off the album. However, the album is quickly redeemed by listenable, if not interesting runthroughs of classics Meadows, Rocky Mountain Way, Time Out and Help Me Make It Through The Night. The quasi-Carribbean rhythm of Time Out prefigures the more overtly reggae-tinged funrock Walsh was to explore in later years. Finally, Turn To Stone is given a competent reading. But where is that thick Gibson tone of bygone days? All in all, worth having for the collection, but if you're looking for just one live album of Joe Walsh playing amazing guitar, perform an Amazon search for the brilliant James Gang album Live In Concert."
3,Joe's Live Stuff Pre-Eagles...,"Having been a fan of first ""The James Gang"", ""Barnstorm"" and the rest of Joe Walsh's stuff up through ""The Confessor"", this album would seem to be a ""must purchase"" item for me. And in reality, it was, back in the mid-seventies when I bought it on vinyl. The best tracks include ""Walk Away"" (up-tempo compared to the original which is why I liked it), ""Meadows"" (I loved the way they sneaked in a couple of moments of ""Giant Behemoth""), and ""Help Me Through the Night"" (a song that never got enough radio play, in my opinion).The other three tracks are only so-so, and I think it was a result more of ABC Dunhill trying to make a fast buck than them trying to turn out a quality product. After this point, of course, Joe would jump to Elektra/Asylum and become an Eagle, which would put him more in the mainstream, at least for a little while....."
3,This is one very big book,"I tell you, it's not easy to memorise every speech in this - but I'm working on it! An inspiring book by a very sexy lady."
2,Not as interesting as I thought,"When my French husband who is a chef recommended me the book I thought, ""Wow... this must be an interesting read."" But after the first 2 chapters I knew it would be easy to put this book down and forget about it but I had to finish it anyway. I am the same age as the author and my husband opened his own restaurant in Thailand. Some of her stories I could relate to but there was too much whining as 1 reviewer mentioned. The writing needs work but then again this is her first book. The compilation of the book seemed messy as she jumps from one story to another. I would recommend The Fourth Star instead."
3,Check it out from the library,"It's a good book with some interesting insights into the food industry. The author began by sharing her frustrations with the industry and the lack of recognition she receives. However, the frustrations soon turned into rants which turned into flat-out whining. It was amusing to find out that, not only is she a vegetarian, she so picky she seems to only eat food she has prepared (and that's mac and cheese). What was originally an amusingly irony, turned into [...] selfishness. The author is so picky that when her husband cooked at the James Beard House, she had to send her parents instead of attending herself because she refused to eat any of the food.Overall, it was a good summer read but I wouldn't want to reread it."
2,Makes Nanny Diaries look like Flaubert!,"While the author has some great, great stories (and they're very close to my own experience), she's a dreadful writer! Please, don't think this is anything resembling a well-crafted book--she's just not a convincing author. Unlike Bourdain,who really as a flair for language, she can't make any situation or character come alive. Great idea, poor execution. Don't waste your money."
2,Too much whining,"After the first few chapters I was angry more than anything. This young girl, who apparently doesn't drink - or eat - and without children to cart around or any other incumbrance, should have more of a sense of humor.My husband and I also own and operate a restaurant, but I also maintain a full time job (which I had before we opened the restaurant), have a 17 year old son, work lunches and dinners and make all the desserts at the restaurant!! Oh, aren't I wonderful!The writer needs to realize that we all work like dogs, but at the end of the day I sit down with a big glass of wine and realize how greatful I am for all of it!"
4,"Great CD, but missing some stuff......","Well, i got the CD, and it's cool, but i think it should have more songs that were in the movie (like The Offspring's cover of the Ramons song of ""I Wanna Be Sedated""..you know..at that dance scene..) but a great buy."
2,please help find song,"Does anyone know the name of the song when Anton was in Molly's room, and then she turned on her CD player... and the song her CD player was playing? What was the name of it? If anyone knows, please e-mail me at ikinge@hotmail.com"
5,Is this song on the CD?,"Hey. I love the movie Idle Hands, but I didn't find the Soundtrack in Germany. So I have one questione, before ordering it: is this song, which is played, while Seth and Eldon were eating Burritos on it? Or does anyone know which band performes this song? (I know, that I made mistakes in my review.) If you can help me: daniela_osbourne@yahoo.de"

1,"One memorable song, but not because it's good.","An OK album. Most of it's forgettable, though. Only The Offspring's re-release ""Beheaded"" from their 1987 demo tapes sticks out... but not for the best of reasons; it's shockingly gruesome. It'll give you nightmares, I swear. It's THAT explicitly gory. Not the Idle Hands movie (not scary at all), the Offspring song. Despite the fact The Offspring say it's not to be taken seriously, it's hard not to considering how aggressively serious Holland sounds. Definitely would take some getting used to for fans of anything after Smash. Overall, the soundtrack's fine, but needed some better songs. Santeria would've been great on here to contrast the rest of the low-fi, depressing ""punk"" music.1.5 out of 5."
3,"Theres a song not mentioned here, anyone able to help?","Does anyone know the name of the song playing while the two rombie guys are eating buritos? the one before he puts tape round his neck. I love this song, I've been trying for years, 6 now, to find out the artist and song. I had it on tape, lent it to a friend and never got it back. Now I can't remember. Please if anyone knows leave a post."
2,missing,"there was good songs on this cd i have to admit, such as static x with push it and rob zombie always enhances a soundtrack. but the problem i had with this album is the songs that are missing. almost all the good music in the movie were left out. it took me a while to find one song in particular, i am a pig from two. then they also left out that 2 live crew song that they showed the video for. why was it that these songs were deleted from the soundtrack, but songs like enthused by blink 182, bleeding boy from disappointed incorperated and my girlfriends dead by the vandals were all added?"
5,The Offspring and The Living End Are The Greatest,This Soundtrack Features Two Great Incredibly Under-rated Bands: The Offspring and The Living End
