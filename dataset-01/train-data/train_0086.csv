3,good read,This is a sweet love story of a tomboy nurse who struggles to be seen as a woman in the eyes of the older man she loves. An entertaining read and a feel-good story.
5,excellent,great product...very well described....will buy again from the seller....fast and precise transaction......and i will definitely recommend
2,Awful Picture Quality,"Though I enjoy this movie, I found the DVD version to be awful. It looks like they cranked up the compression, as there is a ton of compression artifacting. I could barely stand to watch the DVD in some places due to the little dancing color squares. If you are a fan of Sneakers, get the VHS version and avoid the DVD."
5,One Of The Greats,"Screenplays this good are rare; casts and direction that can pull them off are rarer. This is the only all-star true ensemble film I've seen in a long time, and that's most likely what got it the production and publicity it deserved. There's so much chemistry between Redford, Poitier, Akroyd, Strathairn, McDonnell and Phoenix (and of course Kingsley) that it hurts to think that there'll never be a sequel--and this is coming from a very anti-sequel person.This is the movie Mission: Impossible could have been, and the movie a lot of other movies should have watched. It's an ensemble, a genre-blender and a movie you'll want to watch a hundred times. Please, please watch it and contribute to the support of really good movies for a long time to come."
3,OK Industrial Espionage Film,"Sneakers is a tense, well-done thriller with a flawed premise: there could exist a single box that would allow the owner to run the world. Robert Redford, looking older than he is, teams with an very good cast including Ben Kingsley, Dan Akyroyd, River Phoenix, James Earl Jones and a host of other familiar faces to take this little box (that looks remarkably like an 80s-era answering machine) from Kingsley.The fun in the movie is the planning of the heist, complete with a phony computer date and rather easy surveillance of a top-secret facility. Of course, things go awry in the heist, and much tension arises.All in all, a good but not a great film. It gets more unbelievable as it goes on, which detracts from the over-all fun of the film. And, of course, the Republican party gets bashed in the end."
4,One of the better movies from the 90s,The movie Sneakers was a great movie of the 90s. These group of guys are paid to test possible inadequacies in their security systems in order to help these businesses ramp up their security. It's very high tech meet civil liberties. It's a timeless movie.
4,A funny version of Mission Imposible,"I saw this first in VHS and loved it. A team of Hackers are hired to break in to peoples business to see if they are as safe as they think. But when the NSA shows up and askes them to take up a whole new job, break into a mathematician's office and steal a little black box. Upon stealing the box the team discovers a secret, this box can hack into any US computer system.Great Movie and worthy of your DVD collection."
3,Actually too simplistic and slightly overly done comedy.,"I liked the movie in a way, but it was too much of a comedy than an action film--everything is too easy for the characters--the good-guys and all.I suggest you pass."
1,Great movie bought from a poor source.,"While I have seen this movie many many times, and I consider it one of the greatest of all time. I purchased the DVD to replace a lost copy. I received a 24 hour rental as well. Little did I know that if I am not a Kindle or Apple fan that I am not allowed to watch this video on my device or even on my computer it seems.Very displeased, and will not order another video or DVD for that matter from Amazon. I also ordered ""Hackers"" at the same time in video format, cant even download it to watch on my local machine. No different than the lock-in provided by iTune's. From now on if it is not in the Google Play store I will order a DVD and burn a digital copy for the mobile devices. Way to go Amazon, the # 1 selling Mobile OS (Android) that has allowed you to prosper in the Mobile market has been locked out from your services. Thanks. At least I had free two day shipping so I can have the DVD to watch this weekend."
5,Ahead of it's time,The whole time I was watching the movie I was thinking how ahead of it's time it was and how true it is today. This one is a keeper!
2,PC Users Beware,"Sneakers is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite movies. However, this DVD has some serious problems if you intend to view it on a PC DVD-ROM drive. A file allocation error renders the first half of the movie unreadable to most PC DVD drives (precise technical details are widely availible on the internet). This is not a problem for most standalone players. So if you're like me and use your PC as your DVD player, I'd suggest looking into the VHS edition."
5,"Very enjoyable, a must for your DVD collection","This computer hacking movie is one of the best that have ever been made. Its one of those films that you can watch over and over. I saw it at the movies and bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. Robert Redford is a fine actor and the whole cast really make this film so enjoyable.I own the Region 4 version which also allows you to watch the film in Spanish or English audio (as does a lot of Region 4 DVD's), I'm not sure though if the Region 1 version offered here has Spanish audio.In Australia many people by multiple region DVD players so it really does not matter to us where we buy our DVD's but people in the United States might like to check it out first if Spanish audio is important to you."
1,DVD SKIPS,"I don't typically order DVDs online, but this one was back-ordered at Movie Stop for 6 weeks, so I took a leap of faith. To my disappointment, upon watching the DVD I realized it has several parts where it skips entire scenes."
1,Sneakers,"I have been out of town so recently watched and the disk is faulty in ever so many ways; jumps, returns to early story etc. Hope to return but have not accomplished that this busy season."
3,Very political,Enjoyed the story and the cast is teriffic but the left wing tilt at the end is a bit offensive.
3,Good entertainment on a rainy night -- since you can't go out anyway!,"For the most part, ""Sneakers"" is an entertaining movie. If you really want to enjoy, you must first get yourself in the mindset of a 15 year old boy. While the acting is fine for most of the movie, there are some scenes that should have been re-shot for less-than-perfect performances (I've seen MUCH better performances by Poitier). Other than sub-par acting, some of the action scenes are VERY unbelieveable (but 15 year old boys will buy them).Redford, as always, does a great job in this movie, and it's good to look back and see River Phoenix in one of his way-too-short-career performances.If you haven't seen her in earlier days, Mary McDonnell provides some great ""feel good"" for the eyes!"
4,Enjoyable thriller,"This film is surprisingly good in what it attempts to portray - the vulnerability of our systems to unauthorised access and the potential for data misuse. Essentially the film is about cryptography and does not really focus on hacking in any direct way thus making it just as relevant today as it was back in 1992. The cast headed by Robert Redford give an outstanding performance, especially David Strathairn as a blind hacker with impressive hands-on skills. Very enjoyable and well paced."
5,Gotta love the classics!,"I love this movie it is so funny and I wanted to get it so my kids could enjoy it as well. they liked it too, its great when a show is funny enough and timeless enough to engage all the family no matter the age and gender. we love to sit around and watch movies together and this is a great addition to our collection."
4,"Looks great on HD, though the movie dates itself in spots...","I saw this movie when it was originally released and was enthralled by it. The technology, at that time, was somewhat cutting edge, gee whiz type stuff. It's been many years since that original viewing, but seeing the movie in HD brought back memories.Some of the equipment (acoustic coupler anyone?) is so dated now, but some of it still would be considered hi-tech even today. Perhaps the biggest thing 'dating' the movie is the amount of money tossed around as the dollar amounts would be laughable by today's standards, and should be laughable by even the standards from when the movie was made (1991), but that was quite some time ago.There were also many different stars crammed into this movie, including the President from the reimagined BSG (Battlestar Galactica) showing up in a supporting role.My only real complaint about the film now is the inherent political message that comes through. Not just anti-establishment..."
4,Actually tastes like coffee!,"I think this is a very good product for instant coffee. Of course it isn't a real cappuccino--e.g., no froth despite the lovely picture on the box--but it is still satisfying, and organic to boot. I like that it isn't overly sweetened like many American-made instant coffee/cappuccino products. I also like that it's not full of yucky, unpronouncable ingredients--it only contains skimmed milk powder, raw cane sugar, instant coffee, non-hydrogenated veggie fat, and sea salt. It's wonderful for those days when I don't have time to make coffee in the morning and don't want to spend $4 on a latte from the coffee shop."
1,it was expired when I received it,"I was shocked to find out that it was already expired when I received it, the problem is that I paid to ship it overseas to my sister, she found out when she unpacked it"
2,Disappointing,"This book was entirely forgettable - which, for me, is quite rare. Usually there is at least something memorable about a character or a plotline. However, re-reading the synopsis six months after having read the book, I don't remember anything about the story, the characters or even reading the book. Based on my rating, I couldn't have been too enamored with it. It certainly didn't earn itself a place on my bookshelf, and I wouldn't waste my time reading it again."
4,I love Yann Tiersen,"Ever since Amelie I can't get enough of Yann Tiersen. This isn't as whimsical as the Amelie soundtrack, but it has a contemporary feel that is easier to listen to in a party setting. You'd definitely be well served to listen to the previews before purchasing, but if you like Yann Tiersen, you'll probably like this."
3,Not one of his best but worth a listen,"Somehow the style that Sonny tried out does not entirely work in this record. Of course it is tempting to doubt the humble reviewer when you have musicians like Paul Bley, Coleman Hawkins and Don Cherry (even though they play in diferent dates and groups) as band mates. You'd expect great things to happen. And they do from time to time. But some of the 'shrieks' and other nonesense that Sonny tries sound out of place with the music the group is playing. Worth a listen though, as some good stuff is always willing to surface and make you smile."
3,A Plan That Will Work If You Are Extremely Motivated!,"This book has great illustrations of exercises, nutrition plans, and workout plans but only for those who are exceptionally motivated. The nutrition plan is particularly hard to follow but I think if you use it only as a supplement to an already good eating plan it is workable. The workout plans are also very difficult to keep up with and to do in a traditional health club. I have to go as late as possible to my club because the supersets in the plan require alternating between equipment which stays very busy duing peak hours. I only rated this book three stars because of its difficulty for the busy adult to keep up with. However, if you are the self motivating type then you will benefit greatly from this book."
4,Weight gaining system,"This book is reasonably comprehensive in that it goes into detail in relation to diet, touches on nutritional balances and supplements, sleep etc. It covers a lot of ground. About 2 thirds of the book detail exercises, a good number and variety and at the end there is a section of meal and weight programmes. It has the main content being exercies/descriptions/photo's but also in the remainder covers a lot of other related topics involved in safely and effectively increasing muscle mass so it is a very well rounded publication. Definately worth considering. GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY."
5,Outstanding Book !!!!!!!,"this book is just the book for people who cannot seem to build muscle, this book gives you all the tools to reach your goal to build muscle and have an amazing looking body. it gives you tips from dieting, to weight training and more ! highly recommended book !"
4,HardGainers Review,"This is one of the best exercise books I've read. It is easy to understand, gives really good information about diet and supplements. The section on how to do the exercises is a little superfluous if you've been in a gym, although even for seasoned fitness buffs there are some good tips. Hugo spells out a long term program week by week, and after 4 weeks I have seen gains. He definitely shows you how to mix up your routine and shock your body to adapt. Great book for those of us stuck doing the same 4 sets of bench every Monday."
3,The final final chapter!,"Investigative writer's next project is a biography of Damien Thorn, former AntiChrist. As he uncovers the truth behind the history of the Thorn family accidents, his friends become victims of the forces of darkness. Climax to the cinematic trilogy novel spin-offs, Omen V: The Abomination entertains. Fans shouldn't be too disappointed with it."
5,He's missed by millions!,"I liked his sence of humor and personality, so I had to have this great show. He's very muched missed!"
3,If it's anything like the show...,"If this DVD is anything like the show, you are going to love it. Steve Irwin is the Aussi that you can't help but love. He risks his health, and often his life, for our enjyment, and education. I only gave it 3 stars because it is something that you will probably get bored of after 2 or 3 viewings."
5,A must have for fans of The crocodile hunter,"For anyone who loves Steve's show or just likes wildlife programs in general must purchase this wonderful DVD. It includes three episodes that are also available seperatly on Video. Steve's Story, Steve's Most Dangerous Adventures, and Greatest Crocodile Captures. This DVD is a great bargain for what you get, basicly three videos for the price of one. Each takes the best moments from Steve's show and puts them together into over 170 minutes of footage. Not a whole lot of extras but non are realy needed. The quality is above par, the video is very clear and the audio is what you would expect from any DVD. Do yourself a favor and order it now before it is no longer available. A great movie for the entire family that will teach you a lot about wildlife. Keep up the great work Steve!"
5,WAY better than Collision Course,"When I bought Crodidile Hunter Collision Course,I hated it. But,Crodile Hunter Steve'sStory,Most Dangerous Adventures,etc. It was awesome! I espically enjoyed Most Dangerous Adventures. Anybody will like this movie,even non-fans of Steve Irwin will like this movie.recommendation-go buy it today,it's a great movie and a safe gift"
4,Hats off to the Popoffs!,Lit once again lights it up with another rollicking power pop success. This band just keeps delivering hook after hook saturated with guitar crunch and snarling vocals. This CD rocks hard and is their most consistently exciting release to date. This one is entirely self-produced and the mix is music to our ears. Hats off to the Popoffs!
2,An Album I Wont Listen to Much,"This album by LIT is far from awesome. I find myself bored by about the fifth song. I however wouldn't discourage buying the album. It really depends on your taste in music. I love rock, but this one failed to hit me."
5,Another Amazing Album by Lit,"Lit has done it again. Their new album LIT is absolutely phenominal. All the songs are extremely well written and performed as usual. The band put a very personal touch on this album which is noticable from the lyrics which are obviously about life. Everyone should get this album because it is wonderful and showcases the incredible talent these 4 guys have. LIT is a great album for the dying genre of ROCK music. Go out and get the album, you will not be disappointed. Support one of the few remaining REAL ROCK BANDS left. Lit ROCKS!!!!!"
4,What a Comeback...,"It would seem odd that a band like ""Lit"" would be off the scene almost completely for 3 years, and then out of nowhere come out with a really cool self titled album. It would seem odd, until you listen to the music. This is one of the best and most thought-out rock albums to come out in almost a year, with its killer lyrics, nice melody and all around professional production. The first million copies even come with a bonus DVD, full of live preformances and and pieces from the upcoming full lenght DVD. Well worth the wait..."
4,The Kings Of Power-pop have returned...,"I've been a big fan of ""lit"" ever since ""A place in the Sun"". Their music is ultra-catchy and totally defines what ""Power-pop"" is. This is not their best work however. In fact, it falls far short of their platinum success ""A Place in the sun"" and even farther short of ""Atomic"" (Their best album to date). That being said, this is still a great album, full of loud, catchy music and even some heartwarming acoustic numbers. Standouts Include: Too fast for a u-turn, Looks like they were right, needle and thread, lullaby, alright and moonshine.If this is your first encounter with Lit, try ""A Place in the Sun"", ""Trippin the light fantasic"" or ""Atomic"" first, then rush back for this one next..."
5,Another AMAZING Album from Lit,"Lit is one of my favorite bans and they never disappoint! Forever Begins Right Now is my favorite song on the cd, but Times Like This is in close 2nd. If I had never heard the song Pictures of You before, I'd think it was their own song and not a cover! They did such a good job on that cover that they made it their own! Everyone needs to own this cd, as well as all of Lit's past cd's."
4,Good comeback,"Any band that can write catchy masterpieces like Miserable and My Own Worst Enemy can never be counted out; you can't just lose talent like that just because your label drops you. Their self-titled return proves that. When I listened to the first four tracks, I was amazed... they're all completely radio-friendly and successful music videos can be made to all of them. Then comes the rest of the CD... well, the crazy rock riffs turn into 1990's pop that my older sister would have listened to. Don't get me wrong, some tracks after the first four are decent... Lullaby is OK, but I don't have a baby so it doesn't reach me very well. Forever Begins Right Now is an embarrassment. Its a 3-chord example of unoriginality and maybe even plagerism. Bulletproof is awesome. Um... thats all I can say. Not a bad album at all, if you ignore the filler."
3,Interesting anecdotes that fail to hold together,"I bought this book when Richard Ben Cramer died and people raved about his writing. He is a good writer, but even though I agree with his perspective the anecdotes fail to hold together as a whole. I do wish the Israeli people would all read this book and see how what they are doing to the Palestinian people (not the PLO or Hamas) is wrong and is only going to lead to more trouble in Israel and the Middle east. One can only hope that some of the more enlightened Israelis win out."
1,How Richard Ben Cramer Lost,"A very narrow minded and disappointing discussion. I wonder if a better title for this book is ""How Richard Ben Cramer Lost"" Israel as a reporter and author."
1,Sloppy piece of junk,"Cramer's book is a crude diatribe that is superficial, often sloppy, and badly one-sided. His insults of Israel's leaders and contempt for its citizens betray him as a one-sided hack disguised as a journalist. This book has one audience only: left wing supporters of suicide bombers and other terrorists. Anyone with a mind will see it for what it is: a joke!"
1,"A bitter, cynical and angry man","I bought this book with an open mind, and was sorely disappointed. The author is so nasty toward Judaism and Jewish pride. The whole book is filled with cynicism and anger. My advice: Don't waste your time or money on this."
1,Full of mistakes if not outright lies - willful bias,"(...) Essentially, the book is full of mistakes, some so essential that you can't help but wonder wether the author really has any clue at all. Some are so basic that it starts to look as if they're not merely mistakes but indeed intentionally misleading or just outright lies.The book is rubbish, and fit for consumption only for those who've already made up their mind and still think Arafat is right up there with Ghandi as a Nobel Peaceprize winner."
5,Paradigm-changing book,"This is probably the most important book of the year, and maybe of the last 10 years. It says things most journalists are too afraid to say about this conflict, but most of all it shows you the human cost. The author seems to care too much about Israel not to tell the truth about what he's seen there, no matter what it costs him. And knowing how this debate has gone in this country over the past 40 years, it's not surprising that he has gotten so much flack for what he has written from the most rabid Zionists. The surprising thing is how many people really are ready to hear and face the truth."
1,Where is the support?,"I bought this item, and (paid too much for it elsewhere) but when it caused problems to my computer, I found out that no one supports it except the manufacturer. (siig)Sigg Support (only reachable online, where you have to log a problem with their internal system) still took too much time to get back to me, all the while this firewire card is causing error messages, and not allowing my computer to power down...Finally, they got back to me (over a week later) telling me to pull out my modem card (that came with the computer) to avoid error messages.I'm returning it and getting an adapteac."
1,Wonderful series - horrible ending,"I can't even say how much I loved this whole series. It's very unusual to really care about the main characters in a sitcom, but Peter and Assumpta really got to me. Stephen Tompkinson and Dervla Kirwan were fantastic! Which was why I was so furious at the ending. It didn't even fit in with the rest of the series and seemed to me like the writers, or whoever, were trying to get revenge on two actors who wanted to leave the show early. It left me feeling very sad and just.... deflated. I might not have watched it at all if I'd known this was going to happen. Not sure If I'll order the fourth series when it comes out, or not. I'm curious as to what happens to some of the other characters, but I'm not sure it's worth it."
1,FIX THIS PLEASE,"I want to watch the final season 3 episode ""Amongst Friends"" on my Fire but it is a repeat of The Reckoning! FIX PLEASE!!!!"
2,What a let down,"I really loved this series, The story and all the people of the village, What a let down at the end of series three, what a horrible thing to do to Father Peter and Assumpta, However the acting of Father Peter was excellent, I was crying with joy when he finally told Assumpta That he loved her, and then it came all crashing down and she was dead, I will be rewatching Series 1,2,3, but I can't bring myself to watching series 4 and 5, it's just to depressing."
2,"Big disappointment, don't bother","After the terrific first two seasons this was a huge disappointment. Peter apparently underwent a personality transplant and spent most of the season whining and feeling sorry for himself (when he wasn't out of town). The other characters were just going through the motions, and the stories lacked the life and spark of the two previous seasons. The ending was cheap and manipulative. The whole series is spoiled for me now.I won't even be able watch the first two seasons again with any enjoyment."
1,wrong episode,"Like all the other reviewers, I was expecting to find the last episode of this season, except all I found was episode 10."
5,Jerri from Little Rock,"Absolutely loved this series. Everything was so good, from the writing to the setting and the acting. The situations were believable and very funny and poignant. The music also really added to the stories. I stumbled across this on Netfix this summer and have recommeded it to everyone I know. I liked it so much that I bought the first three series. It is really charming. Cudos to all who made this series. I haven't watched the rest of the series since I can't imagine it would be the same after the two lead actors left."
3,Character changes frustrating,"Overall it's pretty good, but find it disturbing that just when I get attached to a character they are written off for some reason."
2,"Missing episode ,Series 9 "" The Waiting Game"" ?????","I had seen most of the repeat's on BBC Prime here in Germany and bought series 1,2 to get the full picture and now just received series 3 in the post and have also pre-ordered series 4.I was disappointed to find Episode 9 missing,with the excuse""regrettably,episode 9 ""The Waiting Game"" is not available on DVD?????????. Short and sweet but why??? I would not have boughtthe series had I known this episode was missing. Would you buy Jackson Browne's Running on Empty without the title ""Stay ""VERY DISAPPOINTING.This missing episode should be at least mentioned by AMAZON.Com."
1,"Link is to Episode 10, not 11","This link on Amazon is the same for both Episodes 10 & 11. Episode 10 repeats when accessing 11, PLEASE FIX. Have called Kindle Fire snd Prime support to call this to their attention."
1,Amongst Friends,"Unfortunately, like others have reported episode 10 repeated rather than playing episode 11, Amongst Friends. Would really like to know how this ends."
3,3rd Year and series getting old and tired,"The third year is pretty worn out and thin on ideas, you can see why the two main characters decided to leave the series. Really enjoyed the first two years, have seen them twice before (and year 3), but watching all of this some years later, I realized that starting with the third year, the episodes haven't worn well. If you do like the third year, great, but it's absolutely the last one worth looking at, the subsequent years with so many cast changes might as well be an entirely separate series, and it's far too much of a soap opera."
4,Episode Missing!,"This is the all-important third season of Ballykissangel, wherein the lead characters, Father Peter and his lady love Assumpta, leave the show. The important thing I wanted to point out here is that there is an episode gone AWOL from this series. Episode 9, ""The Waiting Game,"" is inexplicably missing. As far as I know it is not available on any release anywhere. This probably shouldn't stop you from buying it, but it certainly is strange."
5,Fantastic series,"I'm a big fan of this series...especially the first 3 seasons!! The acting is wonderful...makes you feel like your right there. I find the humor hysterical...and having Irish ancestory, I can totally relate to it :-) Love it!!!"
2,Episode 11 of Season 3!,"Please fix the problem with the final episode ""Amongst Friends"". When you click on it, it repeats epidode 10, ""The Reckoning"". We want to see ""Amongst Friends""!"
1,"""Amongst Friends"" but without Amazon responding","Hello Amazon!Does anyone read these reviews. If so, you may want to go back THREE MONTHS to see that Season 3, Ep. 11 ""Amongst Friends"" is ""amongst the missing!"" I'm lucky enough to be able to pickup the entire Season 3 from my local library today to finish watching the season."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Season 3 #10 left me shocked and in tears-------#11 is the final episode and it is a repeat of #10. This is TERRIBLE!!!!! Such a wonderful series and to have a ""glitch"" at this point is totally unacceptable. PLEASE CORRECT IMMEDIATELY!"
4,Delightful eroticism at bargain price.,"This CD has passionate, romantic music. There is a great variety of songs from some of the most erotics movies ever.Watch Bilitis or many of the other exotic sensual videos andthen listen to this CD. The music quality is excellent. Great for being with your sweetheart with the lights low. One reviewer laments the lack of original performers yet fails to mention that the CD has excellent performances and is at a bargain price. Wake up together with this music on...oh well,let's enjoy--no work today. Fine value. Highly recommended. Dr. K."
5,Great Quality,Great quality. We had been looking for a nice NASB Reference Bible and was amazed to find the leather bound here for such a great price.
2,"Obviously, not his best","This novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1926 (for whatever reason) which the author refused to accept (maybe he agreed with some of the reviews). The author later won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930. The novel is about a fictional person growing up in a fictional state, going to a fictional university, etc. I may get jumped on by some people for saying so, but personally I found the story dull and tedious (a good cure for insomnia). It does not compare with other prize winning novels which I have read that were written during the same era (Pearl Buck's ""The Good Earth,"" Booth Tarkington's ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" etc.). I suppose this is one of those novels that you must read if you are a literature student, but I would not recommend it to anyone else. If you have an interest in the author, I would suggest trying one of his other novels."
1,One of the most worthless pieces of literature i've read--,"I have to say that i do love to read a variety of books, but Sinclair Lewis' novel Arrowsmith was absolutely horrible, and discouraged me from reading any other novels by Lewis. The novel was dull and boring. There was no excitement or suspense. There wasn't even a interesting plot. The novel also had an extreme amount of unnecessary characters,and it was too long which made the novel even more ridiculous. From most novels, you learn some values or something, but I didn't learn anything from Arrowsmith, except that sometimes a nap can be more interesting than reading a book."
5,The Best is Yet to Come,"I know everyone would enjoy reading it. It is a story full of life, humor, challenges, compassion, and sharing. The excitement for the family combining to nineteen persons in a large home is never ending. How this was accomplished and how the problems were solved are enlightening and inspiring. The planning, organizing and control is a leasson in good management. Once you start reading, you can't put it down until you finish. The book is easy reading and a happy story. The problems for step parents and step children are very different and are solved to bring a happy home. This is a unique true story of the big family life in the big city."
3,"Great methodology, poor editing","I used both the 4th edition and its predecessor. I really liked the way that the ""white pages"" are all in French and the ""blue pages"" have grammatical explanations in English. My satisfaction rate was very high with this product...until I went to France to teach for a year. My French exchange partner alerted me to the myriad of errors, anglicisms, and outdated or incorrect pictures in the text. I loved the methodology (in spite of its lack of cultural information), but I would recommend that McGraw Hill correct the errors."
5,Insightful!,"Maya Angelou provides insight and humour in her book Even the Stars Look Lonesome. The book is a quick read but deservedly warrants several readings.The prose is simple , yet profound coming from a woman who has lived through life's joys and sorrows. The book is rather poetic; at times, it appears as though one were reading her poetry and not prose. Even the Stars Look Lonesome is a book for all to cherish; she provides insight on the joy of aging, commends Oprah Winfrey on her strengths, talks about events in her life that shaped her and people that influenced her. Overall, a joy to read; a book that entertains, educates and makes life a more pleasant journey."
1,it was ruined when i got it,"it was shipped in a flimsy paper poster holder that was totally shredded when it arrived. the poster was ruined. posters should be shipped in heavy duty poster containers. oh well, it was cheap."
5,Wonderful product and service,"My daughter is really getting into the Beatles and when she found the Abbey Road poster on Amazon she was thrilled! Once ordered, the poster came very quickly and was in great condition. It quickly went up on her wall and she loves it. Thanks for the great service!"
1,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM!!!!,"I'm hoping that by writing this review someone will contact me, because i have paid for the poster but have not recieved it,, its probably going on 2 months now,, I would like to either be credited or"
5,Beautiful Frog Lullabies,"I bought this CD to help me with my insomnia. And it worked like a charm. It is so soothing and relaxing. I have to admit i've yet to stay away for the whole CD. I did play it during the day when i was fully awake, and it was beautiful to listen to. My cat seems to enjoy it as well. Don't listen to this while driving!"
4,Good CD,"I bought this CD for my pet tree frogs. I play it at night on a loop for them from my computer. It is good enough to get one of my males to call at night when he hears it, if that is any indication. As earlier reviews stated, the first 2 tracks are the best but very short, the last track is long at 40 minutes. I put the other 2 tracks on a several loops before the 3rd song plays. For the price I paid for it, it was a decent CD."
2,Uneven,"This is a really odd CD. The first two tracks are excessively short (just a few minutes each), and then the third runs for nearly 45 minutes. Unfortunately, the first is the best, with classic frog-pond noises. The trickling water in the second track feels intrusive, and the frog noises on the third track are really odd. If the CD hadn't been labeled, I'd have been hard pressed to tell if they were frogs, or birds, or insects. It's not an unpleasant noise, really, but it's not quite what I was looking for in frog atmospherics."
2,frog monotonous,"The sound quality is fine (that's why I gave it two stars instead of one), but it is soooo monotonous. Except for a few minutes of a very loud frog, it is the same thing over and over and over and over and over. I was expecting various types of frog and water sounds. I will never listen to it again. It is beyond me how anyone actually enjoyed this, but I bought it based on other reviews, so someone did. Do not buy it if you are wanting any variety on frog sounds."
5,Croaking Chorus,"Listening to frog sounds is a wonderful way to relax after a stressful day at work. The soothing pond sounds are a welcome contrast to the frenetic tapping of keyboards and incessant whining of computer fans at the office.These gentle amphibians send out a soothing and amusing sound that effectively lulls me into a state of content and good humor.I read in the news recently that psychologists sent frog recordings along in a Russian cargo rocket up to the space station to relax the crew and to help them with homesickness.This frog chorus CD certainly helps to bring me ""back to earth""."
4,Ribbiting Stuff,"If you like the sound of frogs, has Laser Light got a CD for you! I almost croaked after the first ""Duets"" track, but by the time I got a few minutes into ""Frog Chorus"" I was more relaxed than a Horny Toad in froggy Nodville.OK...I'm running out of frog puns.This CD is as advertised. Mesmerizing stuff & cheaper than a lobotomy. All the joy of frogs without the nasty warts."
2,Moderate and unexciting,"This is a murder mystery not -as its title might lead some to suspect-- a horror movie.It centres on a series of murders taking place around the Broadway theatre world in New York .Cecil Moore is an actor-manager now based in NYC .His brother and former business manager ,Jonathan, is murdered ,and soon another man ,a former electrician with Moore's company is also slain .The investigation is carried out by the drama critic of a local paper ,whose investigations are compicated when he falls in love with Moore's daughter,an aspiring actress.He connives with the police to bait a trap -one aimed at catching the killer during an audition for Julius CaesarIts poorly acted ,with unpersuasive motivation and a plot that makes little or no sense.Add technical inadequacies -muddy monochrome photography and sound that suggests the technicians were recording in a broom cupboard and you get a movie only likely to appeal to those who are obsessive about 40's B-movies"
4,Keystone Redux: a nice alternative,"FOr those of you who'd rather not invest in all four or five, or however many releases and rereleases Fantasy Records has pumped out from the Garcia Saunders sessions at Keystone Berkeley in the early 70's, this one cd covers most of the bases without sticking too much in spaceland. One missing ingredient, that would have beenan excellent inclusion, but isn't, so it gets only 4 stars, would have been ""Like A Road""- easily the very best thing in the original 2 record set. But that's really the only gripe. You get The Harder They Come, Positively 4th Street, and the (prior unreleased) Second That Emotion. There IS a good deal of filler taken from Merl's ""Keepers"" album, but for those of you who aren't familiar with THAT, this will suffice to replace that in your collection UNLESS you are the fanatical completist.I like this record & can leave it on while doing lots of puttering round the house..."
5,GREATEST HITS FROM KEYSTONE,GREAT Compilation of hits--singles-from the 1973 era. This along with the more exploratory/improv. Volume 2 are a good combination
2,Component Design PAT550 Proaccurate Oven Thermometer,I bought this thermometer because of the positive reviews I read on Amazon. It does give an accurate read on my ovens but it will not clip onto the racks in my Thermador ovens. I've tried to bend the clip but it won't budge. I initially did the oven temperature readings by resting the thermometer on the oven racks but it is a nuisance to continue to do this so it remains in my kitchen drawer these days...unused.
3,Too small to read,"Although it seems well constructed it is much too small to read in the oven. I sent it back. But I could as easily blame that on my old, worn out eyes!"
1,oven temp guage,bracket does not fit over the wire/racks. It is too small for even the interior mesh of the racks. Worthless.
2,Doesn't read well.,"This thermometer doesn't always display the heated temperature. I have to tap the rack on which it hangs in order to allow the needle to move up. Needless to say, when the oven is heated, this is a dangerous and frustrating additional step to get a good reading on the temp."
2,"The writing is drivel, but the pictures are nice","After reading the excellently written and extremely well researched ""Alias David Bowie"", this book is a farce. It has lots of nice big pictures from the Serious Moonlight tour and that is an acceptable reason for buying it. But the person writing it did very little research, and basically has no idea what he's talking about. If you want to know about David Bowie, read ""Alias David Bowie"" or even ""Backstage Passes"", which is written by his ex-wife, and which I really quite enjoyed. If you just want some nice David pics, feel free to pick this book up, though. But don't expect any content."
3,Good only for pics.,"Like the previous review, the pics are great but the writing is inane. Great if you are interested in Bowie during the Serious Moonlight period, but that's about it."
3,Uneven in places,"I bought this CD as background for meditation. I have many positive things to say about it. The birdsong and water sounds are relaxing. Because there are discreet timed tracks, it gives you the option to select a track for the time you want to meditate, and then you know when to come out as the track ends.However, the sound quality is uneven, and as a result is not natural sounding. For instance, the first track opens with pounding surf and no birds. Then the surf sound fades to nothing and the bird song is brought up. So it sounds very managed instead of being natural.Also, the ""ocean birds"" sound pretty strange to me. Not what I am used to. Maybe pacific ocean birds sound different to the Atlantic ones I am used to , but I doubt it.One of the tracks has a waterfall that sounds a bit bathwater-ish and the rainfall sounds a bit like static hiss at the beginning.But despite the mixed quality it is a relaxing set of recordings. And it's hard to go wrong at this price."
2,would not buy again and do not recommend,"The bird songs are acceptable however the CD is only a little more that half full! This is not like the birds are demanding excessive amounts of bird seed in payment. I can do much better by simply hanging a microphone in the woods, recording in the morning and editing slightly. How is that so difficult."
5,Awesome recording,"I keep this CD in a player close to my front door and gathering room. People who enter the room stop and pause a moment and ask where my ""bird"" are? When I tell them it is a sound recording they are amazed. I would strongly recommend this CD to anyone. Babies and animals pause and listen to it also."
5,Wonderful background noise,"I listen to this CD during the day as ""background noise"" especially during the winter when my windows are closed and the songbirds are not outside to sing their songs. My parrots also love this CD and try to mimic the birds they listen to."
2,Returning this one ...,"Given the reviews on this, I am apparently alone in my dislike of this CD. I just received it today, and ""tried"" to listen to it, however found myself needing to shut it off about half way through due to one repetitive annoying bird that chirped the same chirp like a broken record.That being said, I own 2 other CDs by this company (Thunderstorm and Ocean Waves) and they are Excellent. It was because I loved Thunderstorm so much that I ordered Ocean Waves and Morning Songbirds!I still say this company makes great nature sound CDs, but I'm going to send this one back. As Simon would say ... ""SORRY!""Kathleen M. Diehl, author of The Collective AwakeningThe Collective Awakening: Messages Along the Path of Awareness"
5,VERY NICE,I bought this along with DreamSurf for my Dad to try to help him with his bout with insomnia. I hope this will give hims some peacefull dreams.
5,End of an Era,It started in 1959 and ended in Beauty in 1975. Hundreds f marvelous Songs. This is a beautifull Collectors Item.
4,The thug who killed Stax,"According to Rob Bowman, it's pretty clear that greedy Jonnie Baylor, a stupid lowlife thug to whom Al Bell acceeded way too much power, did more than anyone to kill Stax. This pathetic crook earns a special place in African-American hell alongside Johnnie Cochran and OJ Simpson. Read Bowman's ""Soulsville, USA"" and learn how a piece of trash helped destroy one of the greatest musical legacies in American history."
4,Sorry to see it end,"This is the last of the three boxes. Is it as good as the previous two ? Depends on YOUR taste. But the thing is , there is enough here to keep your musical appetite satisfied for days to come. You'll wonder why there weren't more hits from this period. And you'll curse the fact that there isn't a single commercial radio station that will play ANY of these fine slices of soul. So , buy it , sit back and immerse yourself in sweet soul sensations."
2,Re-Volt,"It's ok for a few hours, after that, use cheat codes to open up the better cars and tracks, play for a few more hours,But after all that I thought it was a average game with some control problems with the cars, it actually mimics R/C cars to well, and the AI was alot faster than most players can keep up with so expect to win only a few tracks. A few bugs, but not serious ones."
4,The RC car I never got for Xmas...,"This game is a must-have for any racing fan. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's all about RC cars, the action is fast and furious, and fiendishly replayable.It's an arcade-style game (no in-game save, limited attempts), but the ingenious power-ups (oil slicks a la Spy Hunter, water balloons, bowling balls, etc) make head-to-head racing a blast. The tracks are gorgeous and amazingly detailed; you can sneak around and find shortcuts everywhere. Plus, there's nothing like racing through a supermarket, a museum, or the deck of the ""Toytanic"".The graphics are nothing short of stunning; the development team deserves special kudos for the weapon effects and excellent implementation of all the 3D bells and whistles... the graphical realism is one of the points that sells this game.That and the fact that the little cars never run out of batteries or break. My kinda game."
4,RE-Volt or Revolt?,"This game is slightly above average. I found that it was somewhat time consuming to get the hang of how to race. On the easiest mode it took multiple tries before I could even place in the first race. But once I figured it out and found the right car (which is extremly important), I found the game to be a blast to play. The graphics are excelent and the game play is good. But it is not a ""jump in and play game"" type of game. Patience is important in the begining. I would recommend the game and say that it is worth owning."
5,Great Looking Watch,I am very pleased with my new watch. A friend of mine has a Skagen and I liked hers so much that I decided to get one for myself. I get so many compliments on my watch. I love shopping on line at Amazon.com. So many things to look at and buy.
5,Want photographs that really capture your family and vacations? Get this book.,"Wow. I have bought a lot of photography books in an effort to improve my pictures - composition, lighting, you name it - but this book blew me away with the simplicity and specificity of it's advice.The entire book is divided into chapters about common situations that you are trying to photograph and gives some simple advice and suggestions about how to better capture it. Obviously not every situation can be covered but what he does cover will inspire you and give you new ideas about how to capture what you see and feel.Sample chapters (How to photograph...):People around a tableThe first day of schoolChristmasA hike in the woodsA landscapeA sunsetYour vacationA monumentYour dogA coupleA baby's faceIf you are the photographer in your family, do yourself, your family and friends a favor and read this book!"
5,Unpretentious how-to book on improving your snaps. Fun.,"I love this book. This book is great for those who want to make otherwise average snap shots into something fresh and memorable. His suggestions are straight forward and unpretentious. The author does not overwhelm novices with technical details, but rather concentrates on helping photographers (novices and advanced amateurs) improve daily snapshots into something memorable.He illustrates his points by showing actual photos with mistakes and all taken by other family members and friends and show how each situation could be improved using the same amateur equipment. Fun to read."
4,This books offers those little tips on getting the shot.,This book offers some great tips on getting the perfect shot to taking pictures. Gives lots of examples of possible shots you have taken and then explains how the shot could have been better. I recognized some possible photos I have taken and went back and reshot it to find that I did like the authors recommendation better. I now am finding myself looking at everyday life events and saying how that would make a great picture. I now carry my camera around with me all the time waiting for getting that perfect shot.
4,Great advice!,"GREAT TIPS in a quick read. The pictures show ""before and after"" photos.I already noticed a difference in my pictures!"
4,Not a new book,"This book was origanally publish in 1987 under the pen name ""Alex Baldwin"". It is a good story in the series about OSS agents Canidy and Whittaker, and the forces in the Philippines under Brig. Gen. Fertig."
4,great,"This book should be selling briskly. it's a stimulating read. While i'd hardly call it Pulitzer material it is a better book than I thought, and am surprised there isn't a strong marketing campaign.I recommend this book. You'll be a better person for having read it."
1,The Fighting Agents - W.E.B.Griffin - UNABRIDGED AUDIO,"Something is WRONG with this listing!! An Unabridged Griffin audio is NOT 4 cassettes long. So that leaves us with an ABRIDGED audio.Also, the full reading should be ""Unabridged Audio Book presented on 9 cassettes for about 14.5 hours of listening.""Also the price is wrong for an unabridged book!!"
3,Not as good as I hoped,"After being a long-time fan of the military/spy thriller genre, this is my first reading of WEB Griffin, oft revered as one of the greats. So it was with great expectations that I bought this novel...perhaps too great! The characters, although many, are well-developed and fun to get to know. The other aspect of this book that I liked was that Griffin spices things up with a little sex here and there, unlike his colleagues Clancy, Higgins, and Coontz. But in the end, I was sorely disappointed with the story's climax -- or lack thereof."
3,The fighting Agents,Fighting Agents was interesting as the story developed around General Fertig fighting in the Philippines after MacArthur had moved to Australia. And the OSS getting help; for the Manhatten project made for good reading.
5,Great author,"I have all of WEB Griffins books and rate him along with Wilbur Smith as my all time favorite author. His sagas span several different action themes, but they are all either military, police or intelligence services. The author has residence both in Texas and Argentina and has spent a great deal of time with our military so he uses his familiarity with these settings and people to cast a very nice spell in his work. My wife also enjoys the books so I would say they are suitable for all readers."
4,More great sounds from an accomplished artist,"It's not every day you get to experience a new sound from an old friend. Sacred Island by Taj Mahal and the Hula Blues Band is the kind of CD that you want to play again and again. It's catchy rhythyms fused by Tajs love of Hawaiian Music blended together for upbeat arrangements.Outstanding cuts include ""Cocunut Man"", ""Sacred Island"" and the traditional blues offering ""Mailbox Blues"". Not a bad song in the bunch and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it didn't have more tracks. An excellent effort from a master of blues. Stretch out in your favorite lounge chair, grab a cool one and let your mind drift away with Taj Mahal at the wheel"
5,Swinging and Swaying,"Been a fan for quite a few years, and he just keeps getting better. This has a true island flavor, but it's well mixed with a solid blues sound. Sacred Island and No Na Maho show the former. Mailbox Blues is traditional. And Betty and Dupree is just solid lowdown dirty dancing music. Hard to pin it down to one style, so lay back and enjoy them all."
4,Good mix of the blues and hawaiian sounds,Taj's island outing is an interesting and relaxing experiment. I've had this cd for awhile and it has turned into an old standby of sorts. One of those cds that never completely blows me away but never dissapoints. It works well on a nice spring day. If you like that island vibe then check out Sacred Island.I'd even recommend this to Buffet Parrot heads who want a change of pace.
3,Not as good as the hype would suggest,"Comparable to better over the counter books...Material does highlight important points, but then presents it as if you were in grade school with salty the cracker. If you were to ask me, I would say buy the AAMC material and then buy one or two bookstore review books that are rated highly. You will be just as well off."
3,User Based Access causes network issues,"We bought one of these, and set it up with user based access on our home network. Windows TCP/IP network using workgroups. In this mode the drive causes problems where users on the network can not browse the workgroup.We email tech support and got this reply:""This is a problem we see a lot when User based is enabled.""but no solution was providfed other then to assign the drive to its own workgroup."
3,Good enough for the price,"I bought this unit for the sole purpose of having access to the our collective family photo collection without fiddling with hooking up usb drives or burning dvds. We access it from an XP workstation, an XP laptop and Vista laptop over a wireless G connection through our linksys router. Access from the workstation is fine and steady, gaining access from the laptops is sometimes a challenge. When it is a challenge, it does require tech/networking knowledge to overcome. If you are not technically able, I would keep looking. For our needs, I did not want to spend more than I did, I am happy for what we have, even if I have to jump start it from time to time."
4,Very easy to set up and use,"I have been using this for about 8 months now on a network with four different machines. Very happy with it... Some PCs have had trouble finding it, but was able to connect with FTP with no problem. Macs on the network have had no trouble at all."
4,simpleshare is simple,"My Simple share 250 arrived within four days. I plugged it in, ran through the wizard and renamed everything. I then went through the advance settings, created some shares on the drive and I was done. The above setup took about 20 minutes as I READ along with the help file! I have 2/4 computers copying files to the new NAS right now. Notice I said copying.All electronic devices have a high failure rate when they are new. I am going to give this drive 30 days then I will feel more comfortable moving files off my bloated PCs.The reason I gave it a four star is I cannot get the SMTP email or popup feature to work. When I have time I will go to their site and poke around and then update this review."
1,Defective items replaced,"Update-the problems I was having were due to a defective unit. Simpletech replaced the item under warranty and replacement is working great. I can not update the stars, but would give this item 4 stars and simple tech 4 stars for the replacement without a receipt.I can only get this to work sporadically. It will work one day and the next day its not found and then its back again. Its not a firewall issue (I turned them office), so its its a problem with the device."
1,Terrible,"Could not connect to the drive in Windows XP SP2; received ""error 53."" Simpletech mentions this in its FAQ on its website, but the fix they recommend does not work.I had to dismantle the drive and use the hard drive in another external enclosure, converting it to an external USB 2.0 drive.Don't bother with this; buy a better brand."
1,Drive doesn't work with UPS or MFC printers,"We bought this drive after reading the company's statement that it works with USB printers. Well it may be so, but be aware that it DOES NOT work with Multi-function machines and UPS Thermal printer.That was confirmed by SimpleTech support team.We had to purchase USB Printer Hub to make it work with each."
1,no support & does not work well with win7 or Vista,"Simple Tech (Hitachi) no longer provides support for any of the SimpleShare Office servers. The servers ""do not work well with Vista or Win7"" as per an email I received from Simple Tech."
4,Nice cd,"I own some cd's from nova radio and this is one of the best.The best tracks are Donna Regina's -why, which reminds me the great daysof the German Gina X performer.More know artist is Laurent Garnier - greed which is a strong piece of work !!!Since I am the person to buy a cd for one or two songs, these two alone are worththe cd."
4,Wild foods cookery,"Originally published in 1962, Wild Plums in Brandy was subsequently expanded and re-issued in 1969. It is a cookbook for all sorts of wild fruit, greens, and game--much of which is simply impossible for most of us to get nowadays. Still, the recipes are interesting to read, and the book has a number of illustrations by the author's husband, R.T. Lambert."
1,Not worth the money...,This item seemed to be very cheaply made. The thread on one of the the ends of the lightweight pipe broke off while putting the unit together. The other threaded end didn't even match up!Spend you money on a higher quality product.
4,"Wonderful cd, wish it had artist information for the tracks","This is a wonderful cd; a great example of traditional bluegrass music. I wish that the first 20 tracks had vocals, only because I'm used to hearing Shady Grove, Amazing Grace etc. with lyrics. Note that only tracks 21-30 have vocals. I also wish that the artist's information were included, either on the back of the cd or in the booklet. Otherwise, anyone who appreciates traditional bluegrass music (particularly with female singers) will love this cd."
4,Could be better,The only conplaint I have with this book is that it lacks scholarship. This anthology does not contain an index.
1,waste of money---just get the full album!!!,"Track 1 is the full length 5 minute and thirty second album version--with all the explicit words censored out. Track 2, the '12"" version'(???), runs just over 4 minutes, and is an edit of the album version, but retains the explicit lyrics. It's not remixed or anything. Just an edit of the album version. SO, to get the FULL LENGTH, UNCENSORED 5 and a half minute version, you have to get the album. This single offers nothing."
3,Underwhelming,"I first heard this album after falling in love with ""Beatitude"", and I must say I was somewhat dissapointed. It's not a bad album, but it sounds simple and timid when compared with their subsequent work. Perhaps it was more interesting when it came out a few years ago. When I hear it today, however, there's nothing that stands out. The music just begs to be talked over and falls into the background as with so much other anonymous downtempo electronica.For my money, ""Beatitude"" is much more intriguing and dynamic music."
2,music distracting & boring,"I agree with the liner notes that natural sound, free from the ubiquitous noise of the combustion engine, is rare & getting rarer. However, the music both distracted me from the relaxing sound of the waves and the music also bored me. The principle of composing music to complement Nature seems sound, & I'm sure the musician did his best, but it didn't work for me."
1,disappointed,"As a classically trained musician, I found this ""music"" more annoying than relaxing. But, I think that it might work alright for other people. It was an experiment, and I found that Baroque and Classical instrumental music works better for me."
4,"Excellent writing, superb plot, phenomenal acting","This movie is about a good cop forced to undergo severe hardship in order to do what he knows is right. The dialogue is very natural and excellently performed. The plot is intriguing all the way through. LaPaglia, Weaving, Otto, and the other actors were fantastic. As a die-hard LaPaglia fan, I couldn't be more pleased!If you're looking for a solid cop story with a touch of heart (but nothing soppy), I highly recommend this film.The only downside to this movie is it occasionally has slightly cheesy music and a few other hints that it was produced on the cheap. Still, if this is the kind of gem that can come out of inexpensive production, what excuse is left for big studios to turn out so much crap? This movie shows that good writing and acting are the most important parts of any film. See it!"
3,Internal View,"Why The Custodian to watch?It is a rare gleam of an Australian reality, of which lacquer has been taken off by depicting a virtue of policing in Sydney, Australia, well dissolved, according to a movie, in bribery, illegality, sex and all a ""mateship"" (more known outside Australia term for ""mafia"") presents."
5,Volume One of a great series,"Check out my review of the box set containing Volumes 1 through 4 of this series.Apart from anything else, it lists the episodes included on this and the other tapes."
4,BLITZ...KRIEG,"A good CD but the samples are too short and not so realistics... The sounds are good and you can have a lot of fun with it... if it's not for a professionnal use. I have enjoyed this CD (I am not a pro)and, for me, it's first quality is... you will not find this kind of CD in France ! so..."
2,cheaply made t-rex,"My son loved this in the package, but the t-rex literally broke within 5 minutes of opening the box. we exchanged it for something elso. what a dissappointment."
3,Easily broken,"All these KOng toys had the same theme, a string inside that would allow the toy to fall apart slightly (like the figure going limp if it lost the battle)...I could never get the string tight enough after the first time of ""using it""...gave it a 3 because it was the only toyline doing kong figures and my son loved the movie... like most toys it got its 3 days in the sun and now lies dormant in the closet somewhere."
4,Good enought better than my rateing for the lone v rex figure,"I would say this is the best of the kong figures witch include double figures because the baby V rex does not fall apart and his head doesn,t twist about like hes spasticated or something cause he is like crazy hes like HELLO!!!!!! plus even when you wind up the lone V rex figure he still fals apart plus the natives are like in a punch mode and the non native is like falling down like hes about to be eaten but back to this one kong is sort of fun to mess around with but the baby is maybe to stiff so I give the kong 7/10 and the juvinile 4/10"
5,Tough and great quality,"I bought this with the need to always know two different timezones. It does this and more. I typically subject my watches to some pretty extreme conditions and use and it's held up to all of it. I would recommend this to everyone, especially aviators."
2,Not exactly what I expected ...,"This bit is fairly well made and reasonably finished for an inexpensive item. I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars as a good combination of low cost and reasonably quality except that it arrived marked ""Made in China."" Nobody who cares for animals needs to be reminded that ""made in China"" means disaster-in-the-making. No agency checks or regulates the advertised metal content of horse bits. The Chinese record of substituting adulterated materials is too egregious to be overlooked. I bought 3 of these for clients who will have to wait a little longer for bits made in the UK, the US, or the continental EU where there is (usually) some assurance that the metal content on the label is the metal content in the bit. The folks who sold me the bits are not to blame -- I should have asked. These bits will be mounted on my ""reminder wall"" -- not the place with the ribbons and trophies, but the one that records the ""I should have done better"" events."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This CD doesn't cost much, but it's not particularly good either. The audio is indistinct and not as soothing as expected."
2,computer generated,my children hated it. they asked to please turn off the scarey music. I didn't think it was that great at all
3,Tinnitus coping,Purchased this CD to help mask the ringing tinnitus in my ears. It seems to help mute the noise as well as help relax.
3,sometimes too frenetic for sleep,"I've had this CD for many years. I seldom play it anymore, because I find it more relaxing to listen to one long track of ocean waves. This CD has four different tracks. One track was a little too frenetic, and I also found the change from one track to another disruptive. For example, I'd be drifting off to the sound of pleasantly minimal wave action, when suddenly the next track would be loud, fast waves crashing against rocks! Someone else commented on the bird calls--yeah, that was a little jarring for me, too. Probably this CD would be great for someone just wanting ocean sounds in the background while working, rather than sleeping. Can't say I ever thought the waves sounded phony. To me they sounded like real waves."
2,Ocean Waves too high pitched and grating,"This is anything but soothing. The tone is too high pitched; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky Carmel coastline that I was hoping for. I did buy the twofer and got the Ocean Surf CD by Dan Gibson and found it much more relaxing, even though it isn't a tumbling surf sound. I was able to fall asleep... which was my goal. Now if I could only return Ocean Waves."
1,What a Disappointment!,"I was hoping this would be a realistic, relaxing cd but it certainly fell short of that expectation! To me the sounds appear to have been recorded in a studio rather than at a beach. For this reason, I had a difficult time listening to it all the way through and I would rate this cd at less than one star."
3,"Static rolling in, static rolling out","I'm just not that impressed with ocean waves on CD. It sounds like bad radio reception fading in and fading out. With birds. Yeah, I can close my eyes and 'see' the sandy beach with the cool breeze and the smell of coconut tan lotion. But I have to try really hard. But as far as sounds on CD go, Ocean waves are the worst. Fire is pretty close to being the worst."
5,A genuinely readable introdution for the applied scientist,This is an excellent introduction to the calculus of variations and Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. It is written exceptionally clearly and gives the reader access to the calculus without becoming bogged down in lengthy diffcult proofs (which are left to the end).I recommend this book to any student or scientist who is not a pure mathematician but wishes to understand and apply analytic tools of optimization.
3,Moron fun,"Got time to kill? ... Well, grab the joystick and spend some ... throwing chocolate salty balls at the South Park characters as you race around town. It's not easy, but nonetheless requires minimum grey matter to learn. Not worth skipping the next dime for, but if you have a few extra dollars and still haven't grown up from liking South Park, yup, this is your game."
5,Stunning photography!,"If you want to know the soul of Ireland then sit in a quiet spot with ""The Irish File"" and let the images show you an Ireland you probably never knew. As a photographer I am not easily impressed with ""photography"" books but Jon Riley's images in his book are absolutely stunning! Well done Jon and thank you!"
5,Wonderful Book,"I suppose Jon Riley's Irish File could be classified as a travel book. However, that description falls short of the true value of this book. This is a travel book with spirit and soul. Riley doesn't just look ""at"" Ireland, but looks ""into"" the spirit of Ireland. The photographs and the words, both Riley's and O'Faolain's, give the viewer a sense of, not only seeing images of Ireland, but feeling, hearing and almost smelling the countryside. This is a beautiful book- beautifully photographed, written, and designed- worth owning for those reasons alone, even if you don't have a specific interest in the Emerald Isle."
2,Glee,"It was not what I expected. I wanted to see what ""Glee"" would do in memory of Whitney. I was disappointed, at least I did not spend a lot of money for it."
2,terrible,I have watched Glee from season 1 and loved it so much I bought both seasons. But I have to say that this first episode is terrible. It is horrible that Glee is not only glorifying sexuality in high school (skanks really?) but it is now taking shots at Special Needs kids as well. I find that is unappropriated for the age group they are targeting when what they say they are promoting is acceptance. I am really surprised with this episode.
2,Picture sucks,"I have nothing bad to say about this episode, but about the picture quality of the Instant Video. I have purchased several episodes of different shows from Amazon and the picture quality is awful on all of them. I have a new computer with a very fast processor so I don't think it's my computer. I even uninstalled and re-installed the Amazon Unbox player."
1,Disappointing,"For a show that claims to have strong ties with anti bully movements, this couldn't have been more of a joke. Gay kids are protected but people like Lauren are fair game? (The one that got away very slowly) Come on! As if making fun of overweight kids isn't enough, let's add in a few good aims at Asperger's too. All we need now is some good mocking of Becky and the season should be complete right? Highly disappointing. A show I once loved is losing credibility quickly. I'm not sure if I'll be able to stick out this season if this is how things are going to continue to go."
5,Santana!,I feel really bad for santana in this episode. But It really showcases her talents with Mercedes once again! Also I like where the storyline is going!
5,love it,"I think that this season shows a lot of promise. I really enjoyed the last three episodes and can't wait for the season to resume on November 1!!!! Although I must say that I didn't find season 2 as disappointing as some people did, so I'm not as critical on Glee as those who did."
1,Sucks,"Unlike the majority of the people who hate Glee, I was actually willing to give this show a chance. Big mistake that was."
2,Didn't finish this one yet.,"I have enjoyed all of the Glee episodes up to now. I had to stop watching this one because the character Mercedes was so completely annoying. I don't blame her as much as the writers for this. Why do you have to make her to so aggressively whiney? It is really off putting and I'm tired of the same, ""I'm standing up for myself because I'm not better than Rachel"" coming up constantly. Ugh. I'm taking a looooonnnnng break from this show because of this. I stopped enjoying it. Hopefully, after a break, I will enjoy it again!!!"
5,Gleek w/Ricky Martin,Love Glee and I had missed this episode with Ricky Martin. It was fantastic. Thanks for making TV shows available on Kindle Fire.
5,Glee Rocks,I wasn't into it at first. But one look and I couldn't stop watching. I hope there will be more seasons. I really like Finn and Rachel. They are the top couple. I am totally hooked now.
3,"Glee Season 3, worth the wait..","I too was a little disappointed with episode 1, too much Kurt. Kurt with Rachel, Kurt with blaine, Kurt with the whole team and then again the pattern repeated itself. Also was waiting to see a stronger Finn! C'mon this is his senior year! After all, Glee started working as soon as he joined!Episode 2 was good, I had to run and get a box of kleenex! I! will continue watching, but if they put Finn on the back burner so that Blaine can be in the spotlight, I will stop watching it too. Blaine is great, don't get me wrong, but this season is supposed to be about the original cast of Glee."
1,So disappointing,"What a let down. The characters were all acting like strangers. There was no cohesion. Everyone was stiff. And lots of holes. How did Will and Emma hook up, for example? Quinn flicked the cigarette, but it was Santana's fault that the piano blew up?It's looking like Season 3 could be worse than Season 2. But i'll keep watching of course..."
3,"Entertaining, but long in tooth","Glee had some great two seasons. This third one has seem too contrived and unnecessary. Still watchable, but not as clever, and not as fresh. And, the old looking cast, looks positively late twenties this year!"
4,Love it,"I really liked this episode, although I would like Finn's story to start, he wasn't doing too much in this episode."
5,Still love it.,"LOVE IT and all the characters, who are all flawed in their own special way, just like the rest of us :)"
5,I enjoy watching Glee.,The picture quality was great and the sound was even better. I can't wait til they release the four season.
2,Glee has become a Gay-Lesbian Billboard,I loved the first season. I enjoyed the second season even as it added more and more GL agenda items. The third season crossed over for me from being a fresh fun & energetic showcase of talent to an every-episode attempt to promote the GL agenda. Too bad...
5,AWESOME!,Have loved glee forever & this season doesn't disappoint(with the exception of Rachael & Finn breaking up...huge bumer!) Cant' wait for the rest to come out so I can see them.
5,Love Season 3,Love season 3!!!! So much Blaine!!!! Can't get enough!!! This season will not disappoint so much Blaine so little time
5,One of the Best,"With this episode, Glee now moves into a different show. The problem with High School TV shows is that at some point the kids have to graduate. Murphy and gang can now go in several different directions, this episode one of the best written and directed of the entire series puts them in that place. Well done."
4,Like,"I really liked this episode, I appreciate that they highlighted a minor character. Although I did't like Meredes attitude. I know Rachel gets a lot of solos, but she works hard for it. I only think its fair to get what you give! I can't wait till November 1st, new episodes!"
4,Silent Spring APES,"The novel made the reader aware of the dangers of incecticides and pesticides by detailing the destruction the poisons cause. Extensive research and direct quotes made the points more effective. Also, the way the chapters were seperated helped to focus on more specific points at a time. Too much of reading it at once could become redundant as many of the topics related to eachother. The parts that were too scientific became hard to focus on, but when human examples were used it regained its sense of importance. After reading the book you can not disagree with the fact that humans should not attempt to control nature."
4,Everything as expected,"Haven't had time to read the book, but the service was great--book came well within the timeframe promised, and it's in as-promised condition."
4,Silent Springs;Ecology Classic of all times.,"Silent Springs must be recognized as Rachel Carson's best work. Also, it's the greatest piece of writing that narrates pesticide problems throughout time. It must be said that for some people, the reading content might be heavy and tedious. Still, its filled with interesting and shocking facts and stories. Reading this book really makes you think about questions like:"" Can a single person really make a difference by him/herself?"" People do not imagine that pesticides have been around for so long. Also, they aren't aware of the serious damage they cause nature as well as humans. I suggest this book be used as a text book in schools. This way, children will get an insight of the danger of pesticides, and will be more interested in nature as adults."
4,Informative Book,"This book's greatness varies by how you approach it. If you are looking for a thick, heavy load of information, statistics, and facts on the destructiveness of pesticides, then go for it, you will enjoy the book. But if you want a story, try something else a little lighter.Rachel Carson does make a very important and serious point that isn't presented this well anywhere else I have seen. If you are interested in the topic of environmental conservation, then you will enjoy the book. Overall I think it was worth the read; for some, it could get dull."
3,Good Book,"A book about man made chemicals and the effects they have on the earth. A specifici example DDT. She discusses thge destruction of the earth and she wants to create awareness of the problem, and not an attack on people. This book was good but got boring at times. She gets very specific but i feel that it is a book that is necessary for people to read and understand the pesticide problem in the world"
4,The New Awakening,"Silent Spring, written by Rachel Carson was presented to the world half century ago. Although old, this book is a new overview and reflection of the power humans have to destroy. The book does not only give detailed information about each kind of pesticide, but it also presents a general picture of what the world might become if we don't stop the imprudent use of these deadly chemicals. This book set a precedent for modern biologists and ecologists. It also changed the view that mankind had toward the lethal weapons it didn't know how to use. Thanks to the advice and research of Rachel Carson, innovative ways of handling pesticides have been developed and human concern for the environment has been greatly awakened in the last half of the century. This is a magnificient work in which not only information has been recopilated, but also expresses human nature and sense for preserving our only home and partners, the animals."
3,Silent Spring,The book is in fairly good condition but it has a musty smell to it when you open it. The pages are not torn and the paper cover is on it with a plastic protector. This is a withdrawn library book.
4,Dated but Still a Relevant Warning,Chemicals are not dangerous and there is no such thing as global warming. Sarah Palin is so much more in tune with the environment than Rachel Carson was. Know what's nice about seeing American Eagles? DDT came oh so close to wiping them out!
1,bad environmentalism costs lives,"What followed was a malaria epidemic the likes of which South Africa had never seen. The death rate increased tenfold, but in 2000 South Africa re-introduced DDT spraying and malaria was reduced by 80 percent."
1,This book is a tragedy,"This book is responsible for the deaths of several million people.Largely due to the fallout from this book, DDT was banned worldwide. Even though the ban was based on shoddy and now discredited science, this book sparked the popular imagination and chemoparanoia of scientific illiterates everywhere. As a consequence, a cheap, effective, and SAFE pesticide was denied to the poorest countries who needed it most. Malarial mosquitoes that were just beginning to come under contol instead rebounded, and rates of malaria -- often fatal in poor countries -- skyrocketed. Millions have died as result.Of course, none of this mattered to Ms. Carson, or to her legions of acolytes. To them, feeling good about supposedly ""pwotecting the enviwoment"" was more important about getting their facts right, and infinitely more important than the lives of the people their carelessness has cost."
1,Wrong then and wrong now...,"Rachel Carson forgets to mention the huge benefits that pesticides have brought the world and massively overplays their supposed downside. Even the hated DDT has almost certainly saved millions of lives by helping to eradicate malaria in many parts of the now developed world. Pesticide use has resulted in a far higher fruit yield than would otherwise have been possible allowing more people to eat more fruit - and as everyone knows, fruit contains many anti-cancer substances. Set against this, the slight cancer risks caused by using pesticides,if there are any at all, are more than worth paying."
1,people dead from malaria,People have died from malaria because of this book. DDT could've helped those in dire need.
2,Outdated,"First of all, this book may have been an eye opener when it came out, but this book is outdated. We have new technology that allows us to rid ourselves of certain pests that we did not have in the 1950's and 1960's. With new methods we have created new problems and eliminated a few of the old ones. Books should be recomended that discuss current problems rather than outdated ones. Although this book was a pioneer in alerting the country of environmental hazards it overexagerates situations to unrealistic levels. It does however suggest a few natural ways to rid communities and farms of certain insects. All in all, I was informed of a few new things that opened my eyes, but like I said, they are problems that are now mostly in the past."
3,Not the best book I've read,"This is not the most exciting book in the world. I'm not even done reading it yet and I'm already planning on burning it when I'm done, but the book is very informative."
2,Drudgery,"The title explains it all. I needed to read this book for my biology class and it took me a month to get over the first quater of the book! I usually devour my books in a day, but I couldn't read a page of this book without having to reread it because I my mind wandered with reading it. This is the kind of book that most students will read, but not really READ the book, unless they are truly, TRULY into the subject. So to all the biology and english teachers, spare your students!!!"
4,Useful but Boring Content,"This book will explain to you why and how pesticides affect the enviroment, you and your family. It opened my eyes on the importance of organic agriculture to my health.I read one of the reviews, and it pointed out that someone drank DDT and didn't get affected... Well, in the book, a scientist drank DDT, and died immediately. The negative affects of pesticides have been widely documented, and not just in this book.One big draw back of this book! It's excruciatingly boring.The bottom line:this is a classic book;if you don't believe in why organic is important, read the book;if you believe that pesticide/chemical environment is bad for your health, read it if you want to know the scientific explanation."
3,Silent Spring Review,"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring is good in its factual reference Although it is very informative, to some it may seem boring. This book is very long and almost too informative. Overall it is good because it shows the actual harms of the different insecticides on human and animal populations. Also it is a good way to inform people of the long term effects of these harmful chemicals."
1,The Facts!!,"Perhaps her cause was just in writing this book, but her short-sighted ignorance of the repercussions was inexcusable. Because of the ban on DDT which largely resulted from Silent Spring, the WHO has estimated that around 20 MILLION children have died of malaria.DDT was, & still is, one of the very best insecticides to control mosquitoes, the sole transporter of this deadly disease. Best of all, DDT is very NON-toxic to humans.The need for DDT is so urgent that even the Sierra Club is justifying it's use inside houses in malaria stricken locations of Africa, South America, & Asia.Way to go Rachel. Save the Birds, Kill the Children...Wake Up People!!"
1,"Outmoded, outdated, obsolete.","This ""work"" is out of sync for today's challenges. It should be retired from print in favor of the more active environmentalists who can make a case for Century 21!"
1,Hilarious in retrospect,"Now totally discredited, and would be quite tragic given the loss of life to Maliria as a result. DDT has now been shown to be quite safe and effective in the long term, the evidence to the contrary a result of conjecture and poor science. With no alternative available to developing cultures after the ban, millions that might have been saved died.However if taken in the same spirit as watching ""Reefer Madness"" while stoned out of your mind it can be quite funny in hindsight. The fact that it contains an introduction by Al Gore just adds to the silliness.Comes off like tongue-in-cheek essay by P. J. O'Rourke. If only we had known then what we do now..."
2,"Lies and misinformation, yet solid writing style","I recently read Slient Spring and it had its downs and its up (only one of them)Some infomartion that Carson used to show the effects of DDT on bird eggs were misleading and others were outright lies. Some of the lies she wrote were bogus numbers of deaths and even the ""effects"" that DDT had. If we had DDT today, I doubt that there would be West Nile in the effect that it is today or Malaria would be as powerful as it is now in Third World nations.The one plus side of Silent Spring was that it had solid writing. The words and ""information"" flowed easily onto paper.So in the end Silent Spring is a good example of how to write, but not how to do research."
3,Silent Spring,"This book was well written and researched, we also decided that we would never read this on our own. We found it extremely repetitive. Each chapters said the same thing over and over. It always talked about how we should use natures checks instead of controling with nature. It also mentions foreign insects a lot, one example being the Japanese beetle. The book also made us very aware and scared about the effects. It made us realize the dangers of these chemicals. People can get cancer from these sprays,leukemia being one of them. It made us want to keep up to date on what was going on in the world with pesticides."
2,What about malaria in Africa?,"While Rachel's theories were ahead of her time 40 years ago, many now believe DDT is not the toxin/poison that her book helped label the chemical as. One thing is for SURE: malaria kills millions, including children, in Africa each and every year. DDT could prevent those deaths at a very affordable cost. Malaria in Africa -- one of those unseen ripples in the pond...."
1,not interesting enough to read the whole thing (very repetitive),I had to order this book for an environmental science class because it is said to have started the environmental movement. The first few chapters were fine. After that it seemed like it was just saying the same thing over and over again. All of the rest of the chapters elaborated about the dangers of pesticides and herbicides (which I do agree are dangerous) while citing countless places where they killed unintended plants and animals. That is the basic idea of the book. you don't need 297 pages to convey that message.
1,It is so boring,It repeats alot of the same things over and over for 300 pages. I thought it was boring i could have read a text book and learned more than DDT this DDT that DDT this DDT that
2,Carson Got Lots Wrong,Try Dennis Avery's book 'Saving the Planet with Pesticides and Plastics' for a much more scientific book. Millions of people are dying in Africa of mosquito-borne illness because of irrational and unfounded fears of DDT. Rachael Carson and her emotionally laden legacy deserve blame for this situation
3,It's a text book for a science class.,"I read Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring for my science class. As I slowly dragged through each chapter, I found the book to be interesting and very informative. However, I also found it hard to read. I constantly had to put the book down and reach for my dictionary to look up words. The length of the book is another flaw. Silent Spring did not need to be 17 chapters long. She could have gotten her point across in less chapters."
3,VERY WITHIN THE BOX,"NOTHING MORE THEN A TYPICAL DOCUMENTARY, FORM IT WAS WRITTEN PROVIDES LITTLE TO NO SPARK."
5,Great!,"Item was exactly as described, it is a great copy for a great price and I couldn't be happier! :)"
5,Required reading for anyone who cares about the planet,This book should be mandatory reading in all high schools. The issues identified decades ago are even more relevant today. This author made a major contribution to the world before her death. Now it is up to us to heed her early warning call.
5,Loving the earth on which we live.,"I remember that before this book, the wonderful brown pelicans had all but vanished from Edisto Beach. And then this book came out, and the world changed back, slowly but surely. After this brave woman wrote this clear and unforgiving book, the pelicans came back, so that each year there were more and more, till finally the beauty of their wings and bodies flying over that wonderful beach were back again, bringing the reality of life back to South Carolina. Just as her fiery condemnation of those chemical poisons helped clear away the death and destruction. Though there are still places which honor the wealth of sheep and cattle farmers so that wolves must die, still the beauty of Rachel's work keep many of us aware that we must work to save all of nature, which includes mankind. Thanks to this book, written by that brave and caring woman."
3,Came with wrong directions,"Decent watch for the price, but mine came with the directions for another watch model. What actually works is to push the mode button (bottom left) to get into the time/date/alarm menus, and then use the start/stop button (upper right) to change the numbers. To turn the hourly chime off, use the mode button to go to the alarm screen and then push start/stop to turn the chime on and off. Good luck!"
2,Water resistant?,I have had two of these watches and both died when getting wet. In the first case I was swimming in a lake and in the second I was in a wading pool with my son. I'm really disappointed because I like the look and feel of the watch very much and have especially appreciated the indiglo light during middle-of-the-night feedings or nap time checks. I just can't justify buying a 3rd one when light swimming or splashing around in a kiddie pool break the thing!
1,Advertised incorrectly as water resistant,"It's a decent watch. But it is clearly advertised as water resistant to 165 feet. This means that the watch can be submersed in shallow water (pool water). But this one can't. Once used in a pool at no more than 4 feet depth, instant death. Had the watch for 2 weeks. It should be labeled as 100 feet, which means it can deal with rain and splashes of water."
4,"Good for working in hot, humid temperatures","This is an excellent, affordable watch to wear while working in hot, humid situations without worry of damage to watch. I use it while working around/riding horses and gardening. Don't have to worry about it getting bumped, dirt-covered or wet! It cleans up well and the band is non-absorbent resin. It IS a little tricky fastening/unfastening with one hand when compared to a ""fast-wrap"" velcro band but the easy cleanup and odor-free aspects make it desirable for certain uses!!"
3,your basic digital watch,"Very simple, a little too old school looking, a little too bulky, the buttons are hard to press. Performs all the basics though (alarm, timer, stopwatch, 2 times zones) and is sturdy."
5,Love this watch,I will admit I have only had it one day but so far I love it. The color is great. It wasn't difficult to program ONCE you read the directions. I like the 2nd time zone and the fact that it has a timer AND a stopwatch. Date and day of week show but with a quick push of the top right button one can see the month as well. I like the beep at the hour. Helps keep me on track. I plan to wear every day except for dressier functions.
2,Looking for something easier and more reliable.,"I bought this watch to replace a Nike one that didn't last at all. It is comfortable and cute. BUT, I can't change the time or any of the other functions. The light won't work and if you bump the wrong button it goes into a different mode. I am looking for a replacement and will not buy another like this one. Very disappointed in Timex."
3,Functional but...,"Nice looks, but very unintuitive menus to change date and alarm etc. buttons very hard to press..leaves painful dents in your skin that feel sore for 10 minutes after..you get only what you pay for."
2,Worked for a while...,"The product doesn't seem to be made well. Materials seem to be cheap. The strap is too broad and thick for me. The watch seems a bit bulky.I wanted a watch that would stop working if it ever got wet and I liked the different colors.Disappointed. My wrist seemed to hurt if I wore it for an extended period of time, so I wore it just occasionally such as when I traveled, in order to safeguard my more expensive watch. It worked okay for a while, then a button fell out. The end came when I was wearing it on the beach one day and unexpectedly had a huge wave crash over me. The watch was wet for just a minute or so, but it fogged up, water got inside and it stopped working. Save your money, buy a better watch which is truly water resistant."
2,So hard to use ...,"I am a long time user of Timex Ironman watches, but really only needed a stopwatch currently so chose this less expensive option. Boo. The programming is nothing like the Ironman's, is completely counter-intuitive and the little buttons are not exactly conducive to capturing an accurate time. Spend the additional $15 and get an Ironman as this is a waste."
3,Good basic sports watch; difficult-to-push buttons,"Pro's for this watch: good basic sports watch, price is rightCon for this watch: the control buttons are very difficult to push (and I don't have arthritis!) when you want to set time and date, use the timer, set the alarm, etc."
3,Can't set date ... poor directions,"Like others, I am exasperated that I cannotset the DATE which it is supposed to displaywith the time.I can only set the time ...which a $5.00 watch can do ...Upon receiving it, I was concerned theband was made from silicone ...which I avoid as much as possible ...( seems like it is silicone ) ...no info on band material with watch ...but, the Amazon site lists it as a polyurethanewhich I will assume it is.( I hope that is the case ... if it is silicone,I will write my state's AG about this being mislabeled. )I like the look of the watch for casual activities andit is comfortable !I just have to ignore the nonsensical numbersabove the time ... which were supposed to show DATE -mine is now showing: 25 60which doesn't relate to a date format at all !! UGH !!"
3,Timex Women's Sports Watch,I purchased this watch mainly because of the color of the band. This is a nice watch but functions are difficult to use.
1,Timex Sport Watch,"I am going to return this watch if I can't figure out how to set the date, etc. Timex wathches are always easy to set up. This is the first time I feel like I am dealing with a puzzle. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a rocket scientist."
4,"Great watch, but band is weak link","This is the 2nd watch like this we've bought; watch works great, band only lasted 2 years and can't be replaced on its own. My daughter loves it- a good size for a fairly small wrist."
5,Good Anthology,"A bargain anthology that includes extended selections from well-known and lesser-known Chinese works, with brief historical introductions and notes. There is a companion volume covering Indian literature."
2,Give it 5 stars!,"I was so happy to get this, it was a Christmas gift from my husband to replace my quickly dimming old CRT. It arrived and I hooked it up quickly, it looked great... then the screen went black, I checked all the cords and everything was fine but I couldn't get the power light to come back on or the picture to show... so I left the room frustrated to complain to my husband. When we came back in it was back on... so I started reading my emails again and low and behold 5 mins later off it went, every now and then it would blink the power light at me, then it would go off entirely, then sometimes the light would come on (but no image). I'm sending it back to Amazon, I ordered a replacement so we'll see if the next one works.:UPDATE: the new one works great, I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!"
2,Incompatible with Compaq Presario Desktop,"I bought this card to add disk controller channels to my 5 year old Compaq Presario (500 MHz Athlon) desktop. Instructions were simple enough. As stated in the directions, the computer recognized the card and recognized the drives that were attached to the card (DVD ROM and CD burner) but then the computer would not boot. It just sat at the Compaq splash screen forever. If the card was installed, but the drives were not connected, it recognized the card, noted that there were no drives connected and still would not boot. I tried moving the card to every PCI slot in the computer (five of them) with the same results. There seems to be a compatibility issue with this card and the Compaq motherboard."
3,new edition available,"The book listed here is the 2001 third edition. A fourth edition was published in 2006 that is far more comprehensive, roughly 1,100 in length, two volumes, and printed on 8.5""x11"" paper. It sells for less than most of the listings here. Google the title and you'll find it."
2,"A well written book, to bad it's full of untruths","Some real skill went into this book. It is interesting, well put together, and involving. It is perhaps unfortunate that it is also full of half-truths, lies, and falsehoods. In essence, it is yet another book intent on proclaiming that, in reality, the civil war was caused by...Lincoln and his willing dupes, geared towards a fascist state whose only aim was to crush the voices of freedom, interestingly congregated in the south. Were Lincoln and his successors as effective as this book claimed, one wonders how this book could be available in so public a format...I'll point out that the book is laudable for it's skill in presentation and well crafted. It's unfortunate that the talent required was put to such dubious ends."
1,Great Expectations not lived up to...,"This DVD is terrible. I thought the quality would be better since it is on DVD, but it isn't. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I had ""great expectations"" for this, but was greatly disappointing!"
1,worst book ever written,"I have read many books in my time, but this has to be the all time worst. If this is supposed to be a love story with a twist, all I can say is ""no thank you"". The insert on the inside cover is to me, very misleading. Granted, it does say that ""bad things"" happen in the book, but does not indicate just how twisted the plot is. I could not even get to the end of the book, it was so disturbing. Someone else read the last part and told me who ""did it"". He too, agreed that the things the person did to others in the book, were so horrid that it was enough to give even the most seasoned reader nightmares. It is the ultimate how to book, when it comes to what unspeakable things one person can do to others!"
1,"needlessly cruel, needfully trite","Not only was I very disapointed in this book - I was also replused by it. What is this prevailing trend in romantic suspense that predicates a really Sick and Twisted Villian??? In this particular book Ms. Robards seems compelled to up the ante by having her bad guy commit an egregious act of animal cruelty - on paper or not, it was needlessly cruel and violent and did not need to happen for the story to unfold. And what a story it is...Poor Little Rich Girl and the Virile Stablehand - there's even the predictable sub-plot romance. How trite and how not very interesting - I've read this story millions of times and 999,999 of them have been better written. Save your money and donate it to an animal cause on behalf of ""Karen Robards""."
2,Nasty Romantic Suspense,"I have read all of Ms. Robards' books and enjoyed all but the last few. Lately, it seems that she is upping the ante with her villains as their acts become more heinous. I read romantic suspense novels for a few hours of escapism, not to be grossed out by evil antics. Ms. Robards needs to lighten up or be listed with other horror genre authors."
2,not her best work,"This book was not what I expected from ms Robards. I have enjoyed her books a great deal in the past. For about ninety percent of this book, no one knows there is a bad guy, or even that people are missing or being murdered. Only the readers know, not the characters, which doesn't make for much suspense throughout the book. The story mostly concentrates on Alex and Joe's relationship, and at the very end the two kids go missing. Everyone thinks that they have just run off. The whole big ending with the bad guy takes about five minutes and is very anticlimactic. I would wait for the paperback."
2,Just another Romance,"I was very disappointed in Karen Robards' new book Paradise County. I was hoping that she would revert to the style she used so successfully in Walking after Midnight. I found that book so refreshing, a combination of Romance ,Suspense and Humor. The characters in Paradise County seem drawn together purely through sexual attraction and have very little in common. The book does have some surprising twists, in both plot and character definition. It is not the norm for romance/suspense novels to introduce drug abuse as a sub plot even though Robards just seems to throw that in as an afterthought. Not Karen Robards at her best."
1,Vicious. Sadistic. Romance?,"This book was written by a monster. I thought I was reading aromance, with a murder intrigue setting. Instead I got ""Silence of the Lambs."" I don't enjoy reading about animals and peoplebeing tortured and killed. If this former romance author wishes to continue writing these sick books. Please stop classifying them as romance novels. p.s. I threw it in the garbage!"
2,Disappointing,"Paradise County is not up to Robards usual standards. The book couldn't decide if it wanted to be a horror story or a romance and, unfortunately, it missed on both counts. The detailed violence was too graphic and intense for the romantic suspense genre. I suggest reading any other Robards book besides this one."
4,Good Read,Paradise County was much better than Ghost Moon and I liked that one. The ending was a bit rushed. Joe and Alexandra sizzled!
5,Great read!,"I just started reading this book for what will probably be the fourth time (I think). I love ALL of Karen Robards books. In her stories, there is a really good balance between the romance and the action...she doesn't go ""overboard"" on one and not the other. In this book I love Joe...he seems sexy without even trying. Alex is strong, but she isn't afraid to show her weak side to Joe. Neely is the comic relief of the book...outrageous and funny. And they way she portrays the ""villan""...wow! Pure evil. What he does to his victims would give you nightmares. Out of all her books, he gets my vote as the most horrifying villan. On a lighter note, I loved the part of the book when they go on the hayride to the pep rally and then at the pep rally...so sweet! I give this book 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! Totally enjoyable!"
4,Paradise County - loved it!,"I loved this book. Though different, it reminded me of Ghost Moon (which was the first Karen Robards book I ever read and loved so). I totally fell in love with Joe Welch - oh gosh, Joe where are you? Wish I knew a Joe Welch! Loved the way he treated his kids, loved the way he loved Alex. I wish.... Well anyway, I thought it was a great read.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I decided I am giving too many books 5 stars. So I would say this is a 4.5 star. My really favorite 5 star (maybe 10 star) is Linda Howard's ""After the Night"".But - I love Karen Robards and love everything she writes!"
3,"3 Stars for the Romance, Zip for the Rest","This book was about a wealthy ranch owner who suddenly dies. Due to unfortunate financial situations his eldest daughter is forced to fire her father's various employees. When she brings the bad news to the farm manager, the reader instantly sees where this is all going to lead.The romance aspect of this novel was steamy. You wanted these two together, they were good for one another and you couldn't help but be excited when they were in the same room. The thriller aspect of the story was completely out of place. Every once and awhile when one of those chapters appeared I felt as though I had begun a different novel entirely. I wanted to skip ahead and get back to Alex & Joe.Overall this was an okay read. I am yet to find a strong contemporary written by Robards. But her historicals are great!"
4,Never disappointed by Ryman,"Ever since reading and re-reading ""Olivia and Jai"" and ""Veil of Illusion"", I yearned for more from my now favorite author, Rebecca Ryman. She masterfully writes about my two favorite subjects - the history of British-occupied India, and good, romantic stories about mysterious men. Thank you for another enthralling tale. My only complaint is that there wasn't quite enough about the relationship of Damien and Emma and maybe too much about the political intrigue. What I loved best about ""Olivia and Jai"" is that the love story was the main focus with the history as a backdrop. Still, I will look forward to ANYTHING Ryman cares to do in the future."
4,Well-written but moves slow at times ...,"I enjoyed this book, but found it a bit slow at times while the various plot threads were being separately spun. I could have done without all the ""chit-chat"" in Simla with the govt folks ... didn't feel it contributed much to the overall plot. Would definitely read more by this author."
5,Awesome gay movie,This is the type of gay movie I always hope to end up with. There has to be a story line and this one has it.
4,"Incredibly Great Acting, but a harsh ending","The acting in this movie was incredible, and very well done. The storyline was good, and overall, a good movie... but that does not mean a happy ending here. In fact, the ending, be warned, was a bit disturbing, perhaps a bit TOO harsh, but despite this, I still have to say it was good movie. I appreciated the film most for the actor who played the role of David, the main character,...his performance was outstanding. Rent this movie, but prepare yourself for an ending that will leave you feeling far from happy."
1,Homophobia at its most virulent,"If the Christian Right wanted to make a hateful, homophobic propaganda movie they couldn't have done better than this one. The main character is a self-loathing blue collar worker in an extreme homophobic environment. The film takes a long time to have any indication of plot, and then it goes downhill from there. The characters are pathetic, the main character is portrayed as a psychotic freak that must go on a daytime talk show to communicate. Real life - are you kidding?Interestingly, trailers from other films on the DVD indicate that this company has a deep rooted homophobic habit. If there were a 0-star choice, I would have picked it.There is no entertainment, no message, a view of life that is depressingly unreal. And who wrote that other review, the producer?"
4,Superlative ambient compilation,"This compilation of the more sedate and ambient works from some of the artists on the Spotted Peccary label is a great collection and serves as a fine introduction to the ""new"" direction in which the label is headed. Many of the cuts are halfway between drifting serene ""warm"" ambient and darker soundscapes. But nothing here is the least bit disturbing or disonnant. Flowing synth washes, subtle percussive elements, warm undertones and drones, and spacy electronics all combine seamlessly, cut to cut, to produce an compilation that plays through superbly. It's almost as if this is the work of one artist in that the emotional and musical tone is sustained throughout the CD.If you've never explored this label, and you enjoy floating ambient or spacemusic, you can't go wrong picking this up. It's a very solid album."
3,Para principiante,No es muy buena.. el mastil es muy grande y las cuerdas muy separadas.. el vendedor si es muy bueno!!
5,6 cats...works very well for me,"We have six cats. I have one cat in particular who has extra potent dander. I know when it is getting bad because my daughter will develop hives if she handles him. I use the Allerpet/C (soak him) on him and she has no hives for several weeks. I try to pro-actively use this on him. It is important to get the hind quarters where cats tend to clean themselves a lot. Benadryl works to rid my daughter of her hives very quickly and the Allerpet/C takes care of the cat. I also use it on the other cats, but do not find it necessary to do so weekly. I also have the comb (furminator) that does well in getting rid of a lot of hair and dander. (If you want another way to manage dander for a lot less, just use regular Dawn dish soap on your cat. I recommend you do this where you have two sinks, one to wash and one to rinse, and get through the process as quickly as you can.)"
3,Allerpet seems to help,I've been using Allerpet weekly on my two outdoor cats and I seem to be having less allergic reactions to them. It's hard to know whether it is the Allerpet or just a period where my allergies are less bothersome. I am still using it as it may have lessoned my response to them.
2,Thought a HEPA Air Filter and the Fur-minator Comb worked much better,"My boyfriend is allergic to cats. I didn't think this worked that well. My boyfriend says that our HEPA air filter, combined with brushing a cat with the Fur-Minator brush/comb, works much better than anything else... He actually noticed a HUGE improvement by using those 2 things."
2,contains allergens,"Methylchloroisothiazolinone (and) Methylisothiazolinone are ingredients that I am allergic to. My husband had to apply this to the cat, who does not enjoy it. I can't tell if it works, because I can't touch her when she has this on her, and by the time she has licked it off, she has covered herself with saliva...which I am alllergic to."
5,You won't find a show like this on the WB Network,"""As Time Goes By"" is one of the reasons the BBC has so many devoted fans. This is an understated, humorous, warm and affectionate show about two people comfortably into their middle ages re-discovering each other after an absence of 35 years. This isn't teen angst. It is intelligent and slightly magical. Geoffery Palmer is the coolest guy on the planet, to boot. Treat yourself to this great tape."
5,I enjoy it more each time I watch it.,I have seen all 54 eposides of As Time Goes By and every one is just as good as the last one. It is a heartwarming series with wonderful acting. Judi Dench and all the supporting cast are made for the parts they play. It is so great to see that love can last so long in absence and bloom in middle age again. I have just ordered volumes 3 and 4 and am anxiously awaiting the rest of the series.
3,Mature Love,"Leave it to the BBC to cover a subject in a sitcom that American TV probably wouldn't consider (or do well), a romance between a couple over fifty years of age. I like the fact that the couple reunited after discovering they parted due to a misunderstanding years before. The show doesn't depend on a lot of flash to get by; it's just a smart, gentle comedy."
5,The Best True to Life Sit-Com Ever!,"I watched the full series on PBS (and recorded every eposide) and have been mildly distressed I could find it on commercial quality video until now. Judy Dench and Groffrey Palmer and the supporting cast are superb. The entire series is funny, warm and realistic. I only hope the two tapes being released of eposides 1 - 6 are just the first installment. If you're tired of Generation X, action movies and a ton of other stuff you can't even retate to, this series is for you. Of course, it's English humor which is more tad subtle than ours and there's occasional use of some coloquial British terms such as ""ta"" and ""dodgeumns"" that were unfamiliair until I looked them up -- over all highly recommended."
5,Britain's Best Export In 30 Years,"Witty, erudite, sensitive and incredibly funny, Dench and Palmer are perfectly matched in this ""real people"" British comedy. ""Frasier"" fans will love it."
4,At last!,"My husband and I saw just one episode of this wonderful series several months ago. As we are great fans of Judi Dench's work, we immediately became enraptured, but never came across it again. This weekend I came across the videos and whooped with joy. Though I hardly buy videos anymore (I prefer DVDs), I just had to have these two tapes. Delightful. The video is a bit grainy at times, but I adore them just the same. I hope the entire series is released -- preferably on DVD!!"
5,the Great Hymns & Choruses Volume 1,"Enjoyed this most relaxing music while driving in my car, help relaxeme while in difficult traffic driving......it is just plain relaxing to me anytimeI drive.....It is also easy singing to."
4,I Quite Like this song,"It's a fun, little ditty with a great groove and makes you want to go out and party. I read the review before buying it and figured what the heck. I did like Marly's first single a lot. I think she has a good voice for this style and the mixes were enjoyable. Yeah it does kind of suck that it was all the same person mixing the 4 versions, but I don't feel that it was a huge waste of money."
5,A terrific book for the money,"Ms Yonge has put together a nice, affordable, helpful book. Its strength is in its ease of use and its compact size. Easily worth the price."
5,The True King of Electric Blues,"I got the pleasure of seeing Albert open for bb king. Unfortunately for BB king, because once Albert started playing his Flying V, with blues power, he demoralized anybody that came after him. He had the entire Universal amphitheater standing. and stayed standing for most of his show. blues power is one of his best. Get, listen, and then really listen. Because you can feel your skin crawl with extacy from those notes..."
4,very entertaining for golf nuts,"if you read this book in one sitting and then go to the golf course for a round , you might not break 120 . however , if you read selected chapters and then try to apply the lessons you might make some real progress on your game . this book is not for beginners . this book is a compendium of "" secrets "" , some of which just might work , but it is no substitute for a good lesson from a qualified professional who can analyze your swing ."
3,Golf Instruction History,"This is simply a history of the better known golf swing methods that have been taught, with a summary of each. It is somewhat interesting. You might even find something that helps your swing, but I doubt it.In the interest of full disclosure, I am the author of a golf instruction book that I sell on the web. [...]"
1,Not pleased,"I just received this product and the entire cabinet is broken in half and one of the mirrors is smashed. What kind of a company ships a fragile item like this without packing peanuts or bubble wrap. If it come in damaged again I will have to get it somewhere else. What an inconvenience. I am handicapped and cannot run all over looking for things like this.Amazon, you need to make sure the people you do business with pack their items better than this."
3,LOW COST,"If I owned your company, I would pay more attention to the to the assembly of the cabinet. The nails thru the back into the structure needs improvement. My cabinet has splits where the nail come thru the structure.LK"
4,Working out very well.,"I was looking for this medicine cabinet, as it was just like one I installed a few years ago in another bathroom.The reviews of this product showed a likely possibility that some glass would be broken due to inadequate packing. Sure enough all the glass was broken when delivered to my house.I followed the instructions that came inside the box. The lady on the other end was very helpful. Just over a week later a new, very well packed box arrived and the glass was perfectI would order from this outfit, again. If you don't mind waiting an extra week for replacement parts things will work out just fine.Great Customer service."
1,item flimsy - packaging horrid broken all other reviews on it read the same,I already sent you one review on this - the item wood part is flimsy as heck - the mirrors are nice. The packaging is horrid -- all reviews I read by other customers reflected same arrived broken - some kept as we did and rebuilt cabinet part.
4,"Great for ice, but not snow","Bought one of these because windshield ice was taking me lots of time and energy to clear every morning before work. The IceDozer blasts through the worst of it much easier (although certainly not effortlessly) and even has some oomph when I can't use both hands on it (I'm pretty short).However, the snow brush area on it is pretty close to worthless if there's much snow at all. I keep a snowbrush for that. And the IceDozer is best for thicker ice. If you just have the merest scrim of ice, it just doesn't really seem to do much that a few minutes with a defroster wouldn't do.I still give it four stars because of the way it handles tougher ice, though. It's already saved me hours of work, and I just bought it a couple of months ago."
2,Rarely useful,"Sure, it's handy for a pile of snow and ice, but it's much more awkward and slow for the more common thin layer of ice that underlies all the snow. For that, a metal scraper is far quicker and more comfortable to use."
3,Great with ice...,"But takes up more room then a normal scraper, and does not clear snow. so you have to carry two products with you...Either buy the Mini-Dozer, and then carry that with a normal brush, or try the IceDozer with the brush attached. Either way i would recommend this if you get alot of ice build up, as it does knock ice out of the park."
2,Not that great!,I bought this thinking I finally found the scraper that would actually do a good job.....dissappointed with the results! Does not work any better than the cheaper scraper that you can purchase from WalMart.
4,Love it,"I bought this for my fiance because he loves the sounds of nature as do I, although my young kids (age 4 & 5) took it because they love it as well. Very relaxing and it makes you feel like you are outside on a summer day. Great to listen to on cold winter days!!!"
4,Great for relaxation or meditation,"Echoes of Nature: American Wilds is a great cd that enables the listener to metally enter the natural world. I have found it particularly relaxing to listen right before falling asleep. It is very soothing and the spatial effects are quite nice with headphones. The sounds are all very authentic. The only sound that I didn't like was the rain--it sounds like static, not really like rain."
4,Nature Sounds,These are played at home and at work. Very comforting and centering. Would recommend for those who have jobs that take them away from the good sounds of life.
4,I love sound of the woodland birds.,I did not have high expectations for this CD. I like listening to the summer sounds of birds at during the long winter nights or on long road trips.
4,Eclectic mix of relaxing themes,"I have many of these environmental cds, but it seems that this is one of the few that I reach for most often. It has a little bit of everything, and not just one main theme repeated throughout the cd. There are tracks of song birds, rainshowers, frogs, woods and more. A great night's rest is guaranteed for me when I put this one in!"
4,Pet relaxer,I found this CD to be very calming. Not just for me but for my pet bunny. She isn't the friendliest dwarf rabbit but when this CD is playing I can brush her and pet her with no problem.I found the CD a relaxing background to listen to when I am reading a book. Because I live in the city I find it refreshing to listen to the sounds of nature. I use this CD as kind of an escape to there when the city noises seem to overwhelm me.
5,One of The Best,American Wilds is one of the best nature CDs in my collection. The environments are recorded well and there is a variety of sounds on this disc. I recommend it to anyone looking to start a nature sounds collection.
5,Better Than I Expected,"Since these CD's are prepared after someone orders them, I wondered about the quality, but the whole CD is the quality of the clip that led me to buy it.Although I don't think the CD is advertised as a sleep aid, I play the night tracks (frogs, crickets, cicadas--but not the wolf one!) at bedtime, on a player with a timer. It takes me back to childhood in the country, sleeping with the windows open, no noise except the tiny country animals going about their lives... and makes me drowsy every time."
3,Not for the squeamish! Not for kids!,"I have had the 1958 book since I was 2. The illustrations are indeed enchanting. However, if you plan on giving this to a child, remember these are NOT the Disneyed versions, but the original tales. Queens order young children cooked for lunch, niceness is despised, frogs marry princes, heads are chopped off, a child's feet are cut off and pocketed, suicide is committed, a young girl cuts off her finger, innocents are changed into animals, parents who cannot feed their many children abandon them deep in the woods, jealousy abounds, material riches are glorified and a girl flees from incest when her father, a king widower, tells her she must prepare to marry him since he needs a male heir.Any of you babyboomers on Prozac?? This is not a book I would read to my children, Mary Poppins it ain't."
2,Buzzing Away,"Nice compact device. I was hoping the use of the 'Amplified' in the name of the tool would allow me to be able to trace a wire with only one end disconnected from a device. This is not the case. I doubt any tracer can be use on an active line.I also found the switch to be a little loose in that you can inadvertently throw it to the right most position without knowing it.The probe is a little too sensitive in that if an active wire is near the one you are trying to trace, you will hear a buzzing along with the tones."
4,Solved My Problem,"Working to overcome the effects of a lightning strike, I had to isolate and repair some fried CAT5 cables running between buildings (inaccessible for manual tracing, in a conduit under a paved parking lot). Naturally, the cables coming into the switch were a a tangled mess of identical cables, and labeling was done by whoever set it up years ago ON THE WIRES with a felt tip pen. Illegible. More cables added since then, unlabeled. FUBAR.The TG30 arrived in two days, and solved the problem. Lacked any documentation, but then, it's not rocket science. You might do well to have an inline connector on hand, as one does not come with the kit. This device is not what I would call ""Professional Grade"", but it now occupies an honored place in my tool kit, and represents money well spent."
3,you get what you pay for,"Works, but not great. The adapters are nice but the toner and generator are cheaply made, very light weight. OK for the hobbyist but not for professional use."
1,Very cheaply made,"FYI, to all prospective buyers, this is a very cheaply made piece of equipment. I would strongly suggest going with a different model adn/or brand."
1,Flabbergasted!,"I didn't expect ""literature"" from Carolly Erickson, or even historical accuracy (I have read her dismal ""biography"" of Alexandra of Russia) but even as light ""romantic fiction"" this book falls far short.I assume the author made up this salacious story after she had a bit too much to drink and tacked Marie Antoinette's name onto her central character. This does NOT make the novel about Marie Antoinette. I echo an earlier reviewer, it's a travesty. How on earth did this get published?I recommend Chantal Thomas's ""Farewell, My Queen"" and am looking avidly forward to the publication of Sena Jeter Naslund's ""Abundance"". Such a fascinating subject deserves a writer equal to the task."
1,a total travesty!,"'Hidden Diary' is a sex novel about a make-believe princess, using the name of Marie-Antoinette. After coming across this novel, I have lost respect for Carrolly Erickson and will never take any of her work seriously again. Yes, I know that this is considered romantic women's fiction, but why do lies have to be more interesting and romantic than actual events? For novels that are well-written but closer to reality, I would recommend Victoria Holt's 'The Queen's Confession,' Vidal's 'Trianon,' or Thomas' 'Farewell My Queen.' Please do not waste your time or money on this garbage."
3,An afternoon read.,"I spent the afternoon in the sunshine reading ""The Hidden Diary of Marie Antionette."" This isn't the best book written on Marie Antionette but it is a very easy read. I suppose it is fun to speculate on what she might have thought and may have said. It has very little historical facts and this book is fiction. If you have mild interest in this historical figure then this book might be for you."
5,A Joy to Read,"I cannot speak for all the negative reviews. I read this book yesterday in an entire day. I loved it! It transported me back to a time and place. I do not typically like period pieces and this made me want to read more. I understand it is not NON-FICTION but what I love about her book is it makes you want to learn more about the real Marie Antoinette. I loved the characters - although sometimes I wanted Louis to finally get the courage to stand up and take charge - I loved that they worked together...! I think educated readers understand the difference between fact and fiction and if you are looking for a romantic, historic period piece to transport yourself on a rainy afternoon - this is it!"
2,Not as good as expected,"I was quite disappointed in this novel, because I have always studied the French Revolution and the royal family with great interest. I wanted to read a very personal and intimate diary of this beautiful young queen, and was not satisfied. Perhaps that is my taste, and not anything wrong with the writer."
2,The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette: A Novel,"While I realize this was written in the form of a diary, I didn't care for the writing style of The Hidden Diary of marie Antoinette: A Novel."
3,Fiction,"I am sorry I didn't choose a biography now. I wanted to know more about MA but instead I am further confused. But it is a novel so I had to read it as a story based on a life. I'm not sure what the reading level is, but I would guess young adults."
1,No Affair of the Necklace?,"How can anyone write a historical novel involving Marie Antoinette and completely avoid even mentioning the Affair of the Necklace, which was one of the straws that broke the French monarchy's back. There is a slight hint to it when Madame DuBarry demands diamonds to rival Marie Antoinette's Habsburg Sun diamond but that is about it.As for Marie Antoinette's trip to Sweden with Axel von Fersen, it never happened."
2,A quick but disappointing read...,"I was intrigued at first and enjoyed the parts about Antonia's girlhood and her preparing to marry, while still very young, a man she'd never met. But, it kind of went downhill from there. I found her character to be very shallow - she claimed to feel compassion for the poor, but didn't see anything wrong with only wearing a pair of calfskin gloves once and then throwing them away. I do not know if this is the way she actually was or just the way Erickson made her out to be - her ""compassion"" did not seem genuine, if that was Erickson's intension. And I just didn't buy any of the love stories which may or may not have actually happened. The whole love at first sight thing between the queen and Axel seemed extremely contrived and convenient. If you're going to invent a romance between two characters, at least put some effort into it. And... you knew what was going to happen at the end, so it was kind of a chore getting through the final half of it..."
1,Very poor historical fiction,"This is a very poorly written book. If you are a reader of French history of this time period, or of Marie Antoinette, you will not like this book. It reads like a romance novel ""bodice ripper"". Writers of historical fiction of course get some leeway with facts, but this is overboard. The author has the young Antoinia having an affair with a stable boy!"
4,An interesting fictional account.,"""The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette: A Novel"" was a very interesting historical fiction novel. The diary aspect is of it is a tad pointless, I found, because of the lengthy dialogue entries. I've yet to read a diary like that, and because of it, I, at times, forgot that this was indeed supposed to be a diary. I would have liked author Carolly Erickson to include historical information at the end of the book, or a lineage page, to better detail the lives of the figures in this book. Yes, most people know about Marie Antoinette, but some don't, and facts would have been helpful. We all must remember that this is a work of fiction, and that dramatic licenses were taken to make this story all the more captivating. If you're graduating up from the ""Dear America"" and ""The Royal Diaries"" series, this may be a good next book choice for you. I recommend."
2,Quite a disappointment,"I read Erickson's other book about Marie Antoinette, and I know she knows the subject. Why she didn't use her knowledge in this book is beyond me. Instead of giving us insight into things that did happen (adopting a child before she had her own), she creates characters who didn't historically exist. Instead of bringing alive the people who affected the Queen's life, she glossed over relationships and character. The King's brothers tried to take his thrown, the King's aunts tried to sabotage the Queen, the Queen adopted a child then abandoned him, the Queen was accused of relationships with her women friends... but frankly, this ""hidden diary"" is as vacuous as critics said Marie Antoinette was. Highly disappointing from Carolly Erickson. Fragmented and strangely distancing from the subject."
4,Enjoyable,"Erickson's main objective (rather than argument) was to imaginatively elaborate on the actual lives of Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI. Erickson invented dialogue and characters. Entries into the journal recited creative dialogue and the deeply personal thoughts of Marie Antoinette. The characters that were created further transformed this book into a spellbinding read. The invented characters of Amelie, Erick, and Sophie enriched the read by evoking emotions from Marie Antoinette, such as lust, love, and hatred."
3,Entertaining but could have been better.,"This book was an easy read but I found it difficult to feel any compassion for any of the characters. The book was entertaining enough for me to keep reading, but I found the characters to be very bland and the ending lacking. If you are wanting a book to read when you are bored then I would recommend this one, however, if you are looking for a book with a gripping plot and characters you can really relate to or care about, this is not the book for you."
4,Her history from her point of view,"Marie Antoinette is told by her family's priest to write down her sins as a means of confession. She continues to write in her journal into adulthood. At 13 years of age she is promised in marriage to Louis XVI of France. In many respects this impending marriage was a peace treaty between France and Austria. Louis is not at all what she expected. Marie does her best to help her husband. As he becomes King and she his Queen, her support of him does not change but she falls in love with Axel Fersen, a Swedish nobleman. Marie struggles with her quest to produce a rightful heir to the Bourbon dynasty. France is in the midst of one of the most turbulent times in their history. The mix of history and fiction keeps your interest until the very end. Her diary becomes an intriguing historical novel."
5,Why Believe (republication of The Quest for Faith),"This title originally published by Inter Varsity Press under the title The Quest for Faith ISBN 0-87784-511-5. Having been loaned a copy of the original title, it was not easy to find a copy to purchase for my own library. Evans helps to uncover the ""clues"" God has left for those of us who have a difficult time believing in His existence. The first six chapters would be beneficial to most anyone, after that, it is specific to Christianity"
2,Broke x2,"I bought this shredder in Jan. 04 and by March 04 the sensor went. It was still under warrantee so I had it replaced and I few weeks ago the same thing happened to my replacement. Yeah, it's a machine and it's gonna give out eventually, but not within a year period."
1,Good Advice - DO NOT BUY,Bought this shredder at TARGET for like $40. Thought it was great value until it died 3 months later for no apparent reason and without warning. From what I have heard and read its more or less about norm for a shredder for this price! $10 a month to shred paper!! Anyway stick to FELLOWES or one of the better brands. Bought an ATIVA from Office Depot for $159 - it was supposed to be heavy duty! It died after 20 pages!! Brought it back with the paper in the basket to proove I wasn't crazy!
4,Bargain Performer!,"I've had this shredder now for three months now and have filled up a few big garbage bags with confetti. I would say that I've already gotten a lot of use from it and I am duly impressed with its performance. The auto-on/off works with little slips and receipts (unlike some Fellowes models); it will chug through multi-sheets, but I don't recommend pushing it to capacity (ten sheets) as one can really hear the motor start to labor and slow down. The drawer recepticle is easy to handle and makes dumping the shredded paper fairly easy. I do wish that they had molded a handle or some kind of grip into the bottom of the recepticle, it would handle better when dumping. For the money, I think this little shredder does more than its share."
2,Not a good value,"I've owned this shredder for about a year. It has been infrequently used and just burned out ... on about 5 sheets. It has NEVER taken the 10 sheets that it purports ... more like 4-6 is max. I will be replacing the shredder, but NOT with a royal product."
1,Don't buy this Shredder,"There are just so much problems with this shredder, first the automatic sensor die after just 3wks. And after just 4 months, the shredder just died. Don't waste your money."
2,"Great power, short life","At first I was very happy with the shedding ability for this very reasonably prices shredder. However, it only lasted about 2 weeks before giving out on me. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Was great- but unreliable,"I bought this shredder a year ago from Target, and at first, was very, very happy with it. It's powerful, shreds great, has a window to see the basket, and is very convenient.But my euphoria did not last long. After a month, the sensor died so that when I put it in auto-on mode, it always ran (instead of sensing when I was putting something into it). Then tonight, after a year and very light use overall, the shredder seized up as I put 4 unfolded sheets of paper into it. So now I'm in the market for a new one.Had it been reliable, it would have been a great shredder- but this one absolutely is not."
5,Works Great!,I have been using this shredder for at least a year and have had no problems with it. I use it daily and it continues to be reliable. I have tried several different shredders prior to this one and none of them lasted longer than a few months.
2,Don't bother.,"Had the shredder for less than a year. The auto funtion has stopped working, just like the other reviewer said in their review.You have to keep it in the off mode or it will always run. It doesn't shred CDs, and barely can handle plastic credit cards. I use it at home to just shred junk mail mostly.I guess that I get alot of junk mail, it made this bad boy die. lolI am going to spend more money next time and buy a Fellowes."
2,Very weak shredder,"Here I am trying to clear the fourth jam in two days. It jams on one junk mail envelope with three pages in it, at most. The claim about 10 sheets at once is a complete scam. This thing is weak and I would not purchase it again."
2,confusion to purchase,"With so many versions and variety it is hard tom make purchasing decisons. THe product information is not much help in deciding between need for UPGRADE version, full verion, box with product key etc. I am not buying because I cant figure out what I need to buy and the differences between the version products."
1,Upgrade - don't bother,Microsoft Publisher 2007 Version UpgradeI purchased this upgrade expecting some new tools and better templates but I was disappointed. Not much new in my opionion. I like the older versions better. As Publisher gets upgraded over the years it doesn't change enough to make the purchase of the upgraded program worth it. Save your money.
3,"New look, mostly the same.","The upgrade keeps your version on the ""edge"" and open to new online variations and themes. It some ways, the older versions are speedier to navigate through and there's not a substantial added number of themes for your projects.On the plus side, the installation had no hiccups and ran smoothly. If you're running Vista (I'm not), it will probably be worth the effort since compatibility is assured.I didn't see the improvements and new materials I expected so I've been disappointed somewhat. That's why I gave it three stars."
3,"Helpful, but expensive","Is it worth the money? Probably not. But, it is a helpful addition to the Microsoft Office package"
3,Is it me?,"I bought this to provide a template for a web site. Creating the site was easy. Downloading it ... well, it is still in limbo. Apparently, Publiser does not transfer well with all host sites."
1,Would not load!!!,"I had the required software for an update (according to the update software). I had/have MS office Pro 2003 with publisher 2003 and the software would not load. I got a message of ""can not file a file"" and the install set-up would stop and exit.Piece of crap!!! Lucky the seller was willing to give me my money back."
3,Used Publisher,Case was cracked but disk was still okay. Other than that it was Publisher and Microsoft accepted it. Now will you quit bugging me about this purchase?
3,Wait for Vista improvements before buying,"See my reviews of MS Outlook 2007 and Vista Ultimate ""upgrade"" for reasons why you should wait a while before purchasing this product."
5,Excellent self-help resource!,"This book is one of the rare self-help books that don't just cite facts about depression, but that also help the reader with his problems! First, Yapko distinguishes fact from fiction, then he proceeds to show the reader how to tackle problematic aspects step by step.The biggest highlight in the books are the numerous exercises that deal with nearly all components and aspects of depression: interpretation, distorted thinking, guilt, relationships ...It expertly combines all the various proven therapy techniques in one readable book. The exercises are quite revealing and are divided into ""pause and reflect"" and ""learning by doing"".Together with the book ""the new mood therapy"" by D. Burns this book is one of the best self-help books for depressed people.As a psychologist I really recommend reading it!"
1,Not written for adults.,"It is bad enough having to suffer from depression without having someone have you dissect yourself in analyzing of the disease or disorder or whatever Dr. Yapko wants one to call it. The book is written in the ""parent mode"" of communication and he was talking down to me. Plus, since his secret answers were printed upside down, I felt childish trying to read them or, since much of my reading is done in public, I was embarrassed with having to continually turn the book upside down. I want to know the facts and not be quizzed on whether my thinking is proper or healthy. Tell me your opinion or what you know for sure about depression and I will decide whether or not to incorporate them into my process of healthy thinking and living. No, this book was not for me."
1,Definitely not the one for me.,"The design for setting the doors open is flimsy and was unworkable for me. I had it set and baited with peanut butter on crackers and in the morning the doors were still open, the bait was gone and the trap had scattered mouse turds. I returned this for a refund."
1,Good idea poorly made,I bought this and another style humane trap and have had no luck using it. I can't get the trap to set right in order for it to function. It seem to be warped save your money and buy a different brand
1,Trap doesn't work on small mice. Just a free lunch,Trap doesn't work on small mice. We've loaded it several times with peanut butter and they lick it clean without setting off the trap. I'm going to try a different trap that will be able to catch a small mouse.
3,"Adequate, but flimsy","This product will catch mice, but it is flimsy. After the second mouse release, one of clasps was lost after it fell off the trap. It might be best to always use the trap with only one end open and permanently close the other end by bending it's sides inward."
4,This is an okay trap for smaller critters,"I have a larger cage as well as this one, It is a good cage alittle tricky setting it but once you get the hang of it you will not have any problems using it. What I like with this trap is you can carry it without a chance of being nipped by your catch. It does the job without killing what you are trying to catch."
2,Very difficult to use and very flaky,"The trap is very flaky and very difficult to setup. And the opening seems to be too narrow. I have not been successful with the trap even once. Now, it is just lying in the shed with no use.I wish it was better quality and was usable."
2,Impossible Trap,"I could not get this trap set right although it appeared to be set. However, the mice went in and helped themselves to the bait without the trap being tripped. I have tried numerous times with the same result.The instructions for setting the trap are unclear and the drawings are no help."
5,outstanding results,"This is one of those rare products/devices that works flawlessly as advertised. I caught 4 mice today, the first day, using one trap. While that number is grossing me out at the moment, I am actually consoled by how easily I will be able to continue removing them from my house without having to handle dead mice or kill something unnecessarily. I'm ordering a second one immediately to double my efforts."
5,1020-Don't purchase for chipmunks (you need #1025),The Havahart 1020 2 door trap does not work for chipmunks. You need the 1025. It is way too small for chipmunks which is what I wanted it for.
2,A little too sensitive,"I've caught three mice already with this trap and have let them go outside my home. However I find this trap too senstive to set. The setting mechanism is a little too sensitive, where as the slightest movement sets it off while transporting it to trap location."
1,not good for RATS,This product was first picture as a Rat abatement product the product is no good for that purpose if the rats are bigger then the little trap they sent I want to send them back as soon as I can for a refund. They say one place it is for rats and mice but it only can be used for mice
2,very small Havahart trap,"Trap is very small, flimsy and hard to set. Altho cheap, not really worth the money."
2,Havahart cage,Trap doesn't trigger when chipmonk enters cage. Can reach bait without going over the trigger mechanism.
1,Bad Option for Mouse Trap,I have had the Havahart for 2 weeks and all it has done is help feed the mice. First of all the way that is necessary to set the cage up makes no sense and the least little movement causes the cage to close. Will not buy this product again. Would return it but through the boxes away. Looks like $3O Down the drain for 2 cages
1,Should not even be called a trap,"After having bate stolen from the trap several times without setting the trap off,I finally use hot glue to glue a peanut to the trap spring.The peanut was actually pried off of the lever without setting the trap off.What a poor design !Have a heart? Yup it should be called a ""feeder""."
3,Rats are too clever for this,"The trap's instructions really weren't too hard to figure out. There was no assembly. So I had it working with far less difficulty than I thought. The problem is that my rats are too smart for it. At first they took the bait without setting it off. Weeks later, when they finally got comfortable with the trap being there, they did set it off, but none of them were in it when I checked it. Something happened, though, because they were scared of the trap after that... they wouldn't even take bait that was close to it, let alone in it. Looks like I'm going to have to use sterner methods to get rid of my rats."
2,Bad instructions,"Terrible instructons, especially the drawing. By the time I sort of set the Havahart mouse trap the poor mouse disappeared This probably meant that someone else in my apartment building probably killed it. Imagine, if I had better instructions, one cute little critter could have gone free."
1,not very useful,What a waste of money. The mice can work their way out of these traps. Traps have been tripped but have no bait and no mouse in the morning. Save your money.
1,Not a good design I watched a red squirrel get out of the 1025 three times so I would not recommend this one. In,I purchased the 1025 a few weeks ago and watched the red squirrels get out of this cage three times. It is NOT a good design. I would NOT recommend it. I then purchased the one door and that works. I would be interested in returning the double door unit if someone could email and let me know how to go about that. It will only sit in my garage and collect dust!! It DOES NOT WORK.
4,Hungry Python,"Our baby python, about 2 feet long, needs to eat once every week or two. We moved and the closest pet shop is over an hour drive away. I purchased 2 cage traps to supply his appetite. They work well except they tend to close a little too easy, as many times the traps were closed with nothing in them. The other problem is the cats, they have figured out that if they flip the trap upside down, they get a treat too! I have figured out ways around this and our python is also figuring out how to catch wild mice instead of the white pet shop mice.........I would recommend this product to those who wish to catch mice alive."
1,Horrible for Small Animals,"This might work for bigger animals like squirrels and big rats, but it just didn't work for chipmunks. They'd eat the bait but never spring the trap, and I even tried one poster's suggestion of putting peanut butter on the bottom of the trap plate. No dice, I ended up just feeding chipmunks. Save your money if dealing with smaller pests."
1,Disappointed,This trap is TOO small for chipmunks. I had to purchase the next largertrap that worked very well and captured 3 chipmunks over a 2 day period.
1,"Poorly made trap, returned for refund.","I ordered two of these traps and couldn't believe how poorly made they were. The cage itself was made of ultra-thin material with sharp edges, and the rods used to set the trap were so tiny and flimsy they wouldn't stay in the ""ready"" position. I have several older, larger Havahart traps and they work fine - this model is made-in-China junk.I boxed them up right away and sent them back. Amazon did issue a prompt refund. Don't waste your time and money on this product."
1,do not buy it,it doesn't work at all do not spend your money and mouse still not catch and trap is still waste
1,not pleased with this product,This trap is unbelievably difficult to set. After all the effort required to set it I have caught nothing after two weeks. I bought another trap that worked well and was easy to set - the Smart Mousetrap by Humane Mousetraps. The instructions on the Havahart included diagrams that were too small and too hard to follow. I do not recommend the Havahart at all.
1,Mouse laughs at our Have a Heart mouse trap,"The first night, our trap snapped shut, forgetting there was to a mouse involved. The second night it caught a mouse, which didn't even say ""goodbye"" or ""thank you"" when I released it outdoors. The third night it remained open, but the cheese was gone.Either the mouse is brilliant or the trap is faulty -- my take:1. The wire levers are not set correctly, which I tried to correct before the second night and again before the third.2. Those wire levers don't stay put, and one slides back out of a little hole designed to keep it and the trap thingamajig in place.3. We'll keep playing with it or replace our two kitties, who were eaten by an owl, with another kitty from my daughter.4. That mouse is pretty darned clever. Or we're not."
1,Doesn't work.,"The rat was able to get the cheese without springing the trap. I give up on the ""humane"" attempt not to kill the rat. I'm trying T-Rex Rat Traps next."
4,Hav-a-heart mousetrap,Good product. It is a little TOO sensitive and sometimes is hard to set. A little more thought to the set mechanism might find a better and easier solution.
2,not what i wanted,i ordered what i thought as represented by the description as a havahart trap instead i got a substitute of a different brand. I then sent it back at my expense and have not received any notification of their receiving of the product. I feel as if I was tricked. I still want a real havahart trap but will wait till the issue is resolved. If a product is not the real deal why are they allowed give the impression that it is.
3,hard to assemble,"Difficult to set up. Instructions were not very clear.Once in operation, however, it works well."
4,Excellent,Purchased this item after buying the squirrel trap. Am very happy with both. The squirrel cage was worth much more than the cost of the item. Was catching an average of 1 squirrel a day during the summer (about 15). Would highly recommend both.
2,"Worked once, but tricky","I had a mouse in my house last winter. I fed him dog biscuts for a couple of weeks, then put a dog biscuit in the havaheart and caught the guy the first night. Another (or maybe the same?) mouse moved in this winter. The trap snapped the first night, but nobody home. The next night, it did not snap, but the bait was gone. I big hands, and find it hard to bait this trap. Also, the setting mechanism is tricky-- I'm never sure if I have it right, and it often snaps shut as I set it down. Havaheart is probably the best trap for people who know what they are doing, but I don't. I am going to try some of the other human traps to see if they are easier to use."
4,working for me,I have trapped and released 3 mice. No problems with functionality and no mice have been injured. I am a recent vegan and have used snap traps in the past. They always made me feel bad. Trying to live without harming any other living creature obviously eliminates that option. Setting the mice free definately was a much better feeling than disposing of their poor little bodies. I did research and have learned that mice will travel great distance to return home. Take them for a drive. Also I did tape up the sharp edges on the doors.
1,Harahart 1020,I have yet after two weeks of use caught a chipmunk or mouse in the Harahart 1020. I also did purchase the Havahart 0745 for chipmunks and squirrels and it works great. It's like two cages in one.
3,Mixed results.,"I have caught two mice with this device, but for every success I have had 5 failed attempts. Sometimes I find the trap is sprung but with no mouse (or bait). Occasionally it was seemingly triggered by the mouse handling the cage from the outside. I am going to try another variety of humane trap to see if I get more consistent results."
4,Best Live Trap Yet,"Got this trap and 2 others a couple weeks back. The Smart Trap had it's captive chew through and escape within 60 minutes of capture. The Ketch All Repeating Trap actually catches nothing--it does repeat the non-catching part, however. The Havahart is a successful, albeit fussy, design. It does admittedly take some time to master setting and adjusting. The trigger needs a very light touch and can't be slid too far towards the trap. After a little practise it's been very dependable at catching even the lightest baby and holding a good-sized adult. It usually renders one a night. I'm getting another one to maximise my efforts. Good live traps are hard to find and this loses the 5th star solely because setting it requires a bit of finesse for such a sensitive trigger. My experience sez it's worth the effort messing with."
5,"Mice and shrews, BEWARE !",It's amazing what goes on after dark in the garden.The battle continues........and I'm gaining/winning.I catch something almost every night.
1,Can't hold a mouse,"I agree with the other reviews that describe this as a finicky trap to set, but after one night of feeding the critters without catching them I eventually figured out how and caught one of the mice that have been living in my kitchen. I heard a ""clink"" as the doors closed and saw the little guy in there. But in the five minutes it took to get dressed and find the flashlight to take the mouse to a nearby park, it somehow escaped. The doors had closed, so there must have been enough space between them and the sides for it to squeeze through. Not an effective trap."
4,works,"was difficult at first learning how to set , I bought in order to capture chipmunks and have been surprised to also capture mice / moles as well just by using a square inch of bread with a little peanut butter on it"
1,"Very Flimsy, Doesn't perform per design.",This cage is very flimsy and only performs per design in the most perfect of circumstances. Not worth your money. Better off purchasing a larger cage.
1,Falsely advertised as a Rat Trap,"The Havahart 1020 is advertised here as a Mouse and Rat trap. This incorrectly suggests that this trap is large enough to trap rats. As the written instructions for the product clearly state, this is a mouse trap and the next larger size (1025) is a rat trap. My rats are happy to crawl in, reach all the way to the back of the cage (in one-door mode) and eat the bait and wriggle out again because they are large enough to keep the door propped open the entire time. This trap is not useful for trapping rats. This product (1020) is a MOUSE trap, NOT a rat trap. My rat trapping is thus delayed in waiting for what turns out to be an inappropriate trap."
1,"Maybe it works for squirrels, but not for mice","We purchased this human trap to try to capture a mouse we had seen lurking in the yard/porch/crawl space. We loaded it exactly as directed (which is very very very difficult, partly from unclear instructions and partly because it is easy for human fingers to spring the trap).And we gave the mouse free snacks for a week. The bait--no matter what we put in--always got eaten, but the mouse never sprung the trap.Maybe it would work for a heavier animal, but the little field mice seem to be just too small to spring the trap. We had, however, EXCELLENT results with a different humane trap shaped like a little green house (although those results included finding out the mouse had a friend...or five)."
4,They built a better mousetrap,"Works great catching mice. No bloody or gruesome mess like with the traditional traps or screaming mice on the glue traps. No guilt with killing the little buggers, either. Plus the kids like to look at them before they're released. Downsides: somewhat tricky to set and occasionally trips for no reason. It took me a few tries (and swear words) to get the hang of setting it. Now it's no problem. Only other negative is the mouse poop falls out and onto the floor. But pretty minor issue, really. All in all, a really well designed product that does exactly what it's supposed to."
4,Effective one-mouse trap,"Very effective - often even works without bait if you put it in the right location. Because the critters can see through it like a tunnel, they are much less afraid to go inside. The only drawback is that you can only catch one at a time, so you may need multiple traps."
3,Works..but instructions are very difficult,For the price..the cage is fine..had difficulty with the instructions...pictures were not good...did not know what the different things were. Took me a day to figure it out..but works..but very sensitive. Only for mice..LITTLE ONES!
4,Double whammy,This trap is most effective when you dangle the bait from the top above the trip plate. I recommend using only one door.
2,Trap failed often.,"Ok, it's possible I am setting it wrong so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.I setup this trap and the mouse was getting in, licking the bait tray clean and leaving. Mouse got my bait 3-4 times without being caught.Finally I setup the trap only using one door open to make the trap more sensitive, this worked and I caught a mouse.Might be worth a shot if you are having trouble with this trap."
4,Mouse Eviction Successful!,"This fat little mouse used to make a mad dash across the kitchen floor, with the two little Terrier mixes always too late to do anything but jump up, skitter around, and look up: 'what was that'?Entertaining as hell, but still.After finding too much mouse evidence in odd corners here and there, I had to act. But I couldn't bring myself to break out the lethal method.The Havahart arrived in good time, and it was fairly easy to set up (some patience required...a little mechanical ability is recommended).The mouse was trapped within 3 days. He now has a new home in an open field a mile from the house. Trap was re-set, but apparently the mouse was a hermit, or his friends and family are smarter than he is."
1,Junk,"This trap is a poorly made and poorly designed piece of junk. The trigger mechanism is far too delicate. If you're not extremely careful, every time you set the trap down the doors will close rendering the trap useless. A strong breeze could set this thing off. In addition, the trigger is so flimsy that it is VERY difficult to set. Save yourself a lot of frustration and don't buy this thing."
3,trap,"Delivery was prompt and fine. The product itself works fine with field mice and star moles, but I couldn't tempt any chipmunks which I was after."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this incredibly poorly-designed product,"What a piece of crap this thing is. I could not figure out how to set the bait tray to be level and could not set the trap to be sensitive enough to shut BOTH doors (not just one).(FYI, I have built radio-controlled kit cars, work on my mountain bike and repair my race car, so, on a scale of 1 to 10, I consider my mechanical abilities to be about a 7.) After all the years that Havahart has been around, I am amazed that this thing works so poorly and has such vague instructions. I tried the humane approach but will stick with my trusty snap traps."
3,Could be a better mousetrap,My wife is a big time animal lover and this is the only humane trap I know about. Still it is far from perfect and could easily be improved.There needs to be a door at the top for installing the bait. Also the trip mechanism does not always work and could be improved by a good engineer/designer. These type traps work well on larger animals but instead of redesigning it for mice they just downsized it and the two problems above resulted.
1,100% Cuban maybe...but this is NOT the Sonora Matancera,"Maybe is not your fault of this lacking of knowlledge...but I dont hear La Sonora Matancera in this Audio CD playing at all!You can hear some of the famous singers like Celia Cruz, Bobby Capo, Nelson Pinedo, Bienvenido Granda, Carlos Argentino and others singing BUT they are NOT being backed up by the SONORA MATANCERA.The Orquestras who are playing here are La Sonora Santanera (Mexican one!) and maybe the cuban one La Orquesta Aragon (who have 3-4 violin players).This is because the singing artists left Cuba before the Revolution in the 50's and recorded the same HITS they had with the SONORA MATANCERA with other big Orquestras in Mexico and New York, USA.So, the tittle 100% Cuban is not that accurate either...and worst of all and it is a shame for the Music Industry, is that they are MISSUSING (and it's AGAINST THE LAW!)the name of the Sonora Matancera and making money through it!So people BE AWARE !!!!"
3,"Love Chaplin, but book arrived damaged...","I gave this as a gift and gave it 3 stars because book was damaged. We both love Charlie Chaplin and he wrote this book himself which is what makes it so important. The gift receiver is reading it now and says it's great, I shall read it after. Looked through it, it has great photos and I look forward to reading it. Was disappointed that although the book arrived shrink wrapped, I did not inspect it, and found after the gift was given and book unwrapped, the back cover of it was all smudged, like the ink was smudged right after printing somehow. With it being shrink wrapped I thought it would not be damaged and was so disappointed that this was a gift and it was like this. I guess I should have thoroughly inspected it and unwrapped it before I gift wrapped it and gave it. I don't like giving damaged gifts."
4,"A Great Life, Only Partly Realized in His Writing","There was a lot more to Charlie Chaplin than what he wrote about in his autobiography. In several instances he would mention that a subject was touchy or self explanitory, and for that reason write very little of it. However, these are the most interesting aspects of his life. The book concentrates almost completely on Chaplin's personal aquantences, and despite how interesting and prestigeous they may have been, it just isn't worth putting into a book. Certainly worth reading though, for there is no better source for information on the begginings of Hollywood."
5,AWESOME SHOES!,I love Crocs. They are so comfortable and it's like wearing no shoes at all! Add burnt orange and a longhorn and these are the BEST shoes ever! I've had several compliments. I'm a teacher and several students have asked me where I got them! I LOVE THESE SHOES!
2,Polyseamseal says it's CLEAR but it isn't!,"I'm doing a project that requires a clear, transparent look so that it looks professional. I purchased Polyseamseal All Purpose Adehesive Caulk after getting our local hardware supplier's recommendation. It looked like any caulk product and so I bought it. The Polyseamseal says there's no color to it and it is labeld as such, with CLEAR right on the tube. The product I purchased is either in the wrong tube, the manufacturer goofed or is color blind. Either way I'm not happy with this product as it says one thing and is another.I recommend you check with the manufacturer before buying if you need a CLEAR product or double check the product before you leave the store you buy it at."
5,A stress knockout!,"This is my favorite CD, and has been since I bought it. My husband and I often go to sleep at night to it. If I have had a particularly stressful day, I play it - usually fall asleep before the first cut is over, and wake during the last cut completely refreshed. I've since purchased extra copies as gifts to friends; one with fibromialgia uses it as I do when in need of stress release. It's such a beautiful experience. I've been a fan of Deuter's for years, but this is, in my opinion, the best he's done."
5,Another Editorial Review,"""There is a veritable plethora of excellent healing music CD's available in the modern digital world. A rather high percentage of the best is by Deuter, a true master of the art. 'Wind and Mountain: Music for Healing and Relaxation' is one of his more diverse efforts. Using a wide array of acoustic, electric and electronic instruments, he has created pockets of warm ambience and gentle textures. The symphonic timbres add panache and verve to the set. This grand soundscape will appeal to fans of Kitaro, Anugama, Vangelis and Yanni. ~ Jim Brenholts, All Music Guide"" [refers to 1998 release by The Relaxation Co., Inc. label]"
3,Wonderful draughtmanship as the adventures of Rork continue,"Like the rest of the Rork stories these two adventures are wonderfully drawn, well-paced and plotted but somehow slightly disappointing. At times elements seem to be deliberate mystification, stray plot elements are not resolved, and others seem to be resolved in a somewhat seat-of-his-pants way. Is THAT the end of Low Valley?!? Where is all this leading? I could wish that the story, which is set in semi-historical time, wove some real history into the plotline."
3,I Am The Author Of This Book,"I wrote this book when I was a bit down on twelve step recovery, and that is the weakness of it. Otherwise, it's an interesting look at a conversion to Christianity, and a look at living with gynecomastia. I've never seen another book written on gynecomastia, or even one that mentions it. This one does. It's not the greatest story ever told, but it's an interesting read, and worth checking out."
4,"Love it, but still have press arm / bench alignment issue","2010 Yellow model. Would give it 5 stars, although I cannot use any bench exercises. The right press arm is two+ inches closer to the bench than the left. Not bio-mechanically correct and injurious if used this way. I have photographed, emailed issue, and although I have spoken with their techs they have no answer and no suggested solution. I cannot believe I am the only one with an alignment issue in the course of their business over the years! Gotta get a solution and get working out."
5,His last complete great work.,"This album, like its two predecessors defined Ike's work. He shows his continued ability (having already proven himself an first rate writer) to take great songs in their own right and rearrange them to make them new and different classics. ""The Look of Love"" is a masterpiece, which must give its creators new found pride. However, there is no song like ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"": Sure enough a great work by the Righteous Brothers. A whole 'nother smoke when Ike puts his inimatable stamp on it.A worthy successor to Hot Buttered Soul, and The I.H. Movement. Like those (unlike what followed) no filler."
3,"Is ""Lest"" really the best?","There's not really much to say about ""Best Of's"", other than what's included and what's not. Overall I think this is a decent collection, but I can't get over what's missing. Being that his ""Antichrist/Animals"" era was his most popular, where is ""I Don't Like The Drugs (but the drugs like me)"", ""Antichrist Superstar"", and ""Coma White""? Also, if he's going to include 3 covers, why not include ""I Put A Spell On You"", which is better than the mediocre ""Tainted Love"" and ""Personal Jesus"". But on the plus side, this does have the good cover of ""Sweet Dreams (are made of this)"", ""Beautiful People"", ""Dope Show"", ""Get Your Gunn"", and ""mOBSCENE"", which recalls a better Faith No More song. Overall, even though this could have been great, it is a good sampler, and I'll take Manson over alot of others anyday. Good painter too."
4,Read no other ratings besides this one!,"The album is good. Of course, it's nothing like a CD of new original music, but it's Marilyn Manson nonetheless. Some people claim that all of the ""greats"" are not there, however, this is not the MTV hits version! Go buy 'Last Tour on Earth' if you're looking for mainstream Manson. This album is a great addition to add to your collection! Pick it up NOW! If you're a TRUE Manson fan, you'll appreciate the CD. If you're not, then you should not be concerned with any of these ratings!"
4,Interesting...,"I've recently hopped onto the Manson fan train. I bought this album online because I wanted the music NOW and didn't want to depend on the USPS. Anyways, each song keeps my interest and sounds awesome! Not one song have I listened to and then went to the next right in between listening to it. Can't go wrong with this!"
5,Manson Still Rocks!!!,"I finally got this in the mail today, and I listened to it as soon as possible! I could listen to my favorite songs for hours! My favorite songs are mOBSCENE, Tainted Love, Disposable Teens, and Sweet Dreams (are made of this) I first heard Disposable Teens from Blair Witch 2, and I liked Sweet Dreams from House on Haunted Hill, but I never knew they were both done by Marilyn Manson. I just found that out recently. It seemed like I waited a month for this, and the wait was worth it, because it made my day. To make my day even better, I found out that there is finally going to be an American release of Howard the Duck on DVD. If you love the sounds of Marilyn Manson, I highly suggest LEST WE FORGET: THE BEST OF MARILYN MANSON!!!"
1,"YOU""LL BURN IN HELL FOR THE TRASH YOU WRITE!!",This CD is a total waste of time and money. All the cd is made out of is noise. Marilyn Manson sucks. And that's all I've got to say.
1,Alice Cooper Rip-Off.,"This guy is such a fake it's not even funny. Almost everything he's done was done before by Alice Cooper. Changing your first name to that of a girl's? Very original...idiot. Makeup? Coop's got that covered. Shock-rock and theatrics in live shows? Oh please. That was done while this guy was a baby.The only thing ""original"" about this guy is his hatred for, well, just about everything. Rips up the Bible on stage? That's just desperate. Yelling that he hates God? This guy's retarded.His music also sucks. With Alice Cooper, you have good songs to back up the stage theatrics. This guy seems to be making money off of shocking idiot teenagers who think what he's doing is new, revolutionary, and cool. His music is horrible.How can anyone even take him seriously? He's a JOKE!!! He should be paying royalties to Alice Cooper for every CD his clueless fans buy."
1,Less We Forget,How can you make a best of album full of 80's cover songs.. Nothing orginal about this... Its all been done before..
1,Boo this Man,"His music is garbage, his image fake, and was voted ""least likly to have a greatest hits"". I would rather listen to an eternity of ""nails on a chalk board"" I hate this man!"
5,Lest we Forget!,"I have been looking for this cd for a while now but could not afford the price, It is a great deal for an amazing cd! If you like Marilyn Manson you will LOVE this CD!"
4,Best of 2004,"This is a greatest hits album by notorious shock rockers Manson. I saw them live in person. My only complaint is they didn't include Great Big White World in the album's tracks. Personal Jesus is pretty much a straight up cover of the Depeche Mode original, doing it justice. Most of the album's tracks still hold up well today. Key tracks are: Sweet Dreams, Lunchbox and Get Your Gunn."
1,Horrible,I never got the product mailed to me. I made the order over a month ago along with another product. I haven't received either one.
3,A fairly good compilation,"As allready stated, ignore the Satan stuff. Marilyn Manson (the person) is a very intelligent person and says what others want to say but are too afraid to do so. I too hate the Satan stuff, as I am a Christian, but I am able to look past that an enjoy his great music and amazing lyrics.Out of the 17 tracks on this disc, I really only like ""Personal Jesus"", ""The Fight Song"", ""Tainted Love"", ""The Dope Show"", ""Disposable Teens"", ""Sweet Dreams"" and the classic ""The Beatiful People"". That's not even half the disc. But, while your skip button might wear out while listen to this CD, there are those enjoyable tracks, which I listed, that makes this CD worthwhile.So ignore the Satan stuff, listen to the tracks I listed, have your finger ready on the skip button, and you'll enjoy this CD, as I did."
4,Ignore the satan part,"I think his church of satan thing is a publicty stunt. I just ignore the fact hes supposedly worships satan and listen to his music instead. I'm not a satanist and I don't think Christians should think that they can't listen to the music. I don't think religion belongs in the music industry at all because religion is meant to be the person's own belief, not to be exploited to sell an album."
4,1 OF THE BEST,"This is a very good album. It is not my favorite but is still worth buying. My parents hate MM, and won't buy his albums. If I want a MM album i have to buy with my own money. MM is a talented person. He is very peculiar but talented. People that say he is evil don't know what there talking about. They don't know the facts. I think MM sees both ways, and when I say both ways I mean good and evil. I recomend this album and all other MM products."
3,Enough?,The order of the songs on this CD is lacking alot of what I think should be on here. But they are all good on this CD. You just need more variety. Just buy each CD which each song comes from and you should be satisfied if you are a real fan.
2,why?,"Ive always felt that albums all need to be listened to as a whole work, as opposed to taking it song by song. Each song is crafted for the demands of the album. That's why a greatest hits album seems like a poor way to get to know these songs. In a way it also proves that im right. These songs, however good they are on the corrosponding albums are not as exciting on there own. No denying that there good, but they feel incomplte. This CD will give you a false representation of the band, and it's not even worth buying it for the accompanying DVD, since most ofthe videoes can be found onf the GOD IS IN THE TV video. In short, dont waste your time with this if you've got a choice/"
4,"Great mix for the ""casual"" Manson fan.","If you're a fan of the work, but not enough to buy all the collection, this is a good place to start. Most of the bigger hits from the last few albums, but the last few kind of felt like filler to me."
5,I was never a big Manson fan but...,"I picked this up mostly for the two cover songs plus a few others.I'm glad I did buy it since there are some other nice songs I had never heard before. Track 7 is nice...but the last track, Reflecting God is just awesome...Highly recommended..."
3,ok,I liked the cd but I could only listen to the first 4 or 5 songs as soon as I got it since it was messed up. so that's some 10 or 11 songs I can't listen to on mit.
5,Oh Yes,The best of the best and then some. Whoever thinks that Manson is sick and twisted is correct and it's such a lovely thought...I love this CD it stays in my car and on my Ipad.
5,Perfection,"All the great songs I remember when I was younger. Amazing cd, very glad I purchased and at such a great price. Can't beat it!"
5,best of Marilyn Manson,"Nice collection of tracks, good value. Has works from every album starting with portrait of an American family to current (whatever that is, haven't bought a Manson album in years), makes me remember why i liked them in the first place"
5,The Perfect Combination,"The perfect combinnation if you are a fan all of his hits including""The Dope Show"" ""Beautiful People"" and Many more."
4,What's missing...?,"That's the big problem with best-ofs like these: there's a LOT of great/important stuff that should be included but isn't. Among the absent are: from ""Portrait of American Family""-""cake and sodomy""; from ""Superstar""-""irresponsible hate anthem"" and the title track; from ""Mechanicle Animels""-""don't like the drugs"", ""coma white""; from ""Holy Wood""- ""target audience"", ""fiction in space""; and from ""Golden Age of Grotesque""- ""(s)aint"" and the title track. I'm not even going to mention the unauthorised Spooky Kids comp released earlier this year! Maybe, 15 years from now, when Rhino does a four CD box set on good ol' Marilyn, these gems will be included."
2,trash,"I love MM. He was great in the early 90s. But now he isn't even trying to hide what it's all about: MONEY. Sure everyone loves money, but this is ridiculous. This cd doesn't have half of his best songs. It's garbage. Go buy the actual albums. They are good. Even better is that you could get the songs in context and not be beating your heads about what they mean. Manson has gotten lazy and greedy. Don't buy this. It's just a waste of money time and space. If you only want to carry around one cd, go get all the albums, pick your favorites, and burn it off."
2,Don't buy this CD...,"First of all, this disc is just the record label trying to squeeze some more money out of this tired old act. Manson was already showing their age on ""Holywood"", with low-quality songs like the ""Fight Song"" and ""Love Song"".This CD is worthless, because Manson forgot how to write heavy songs after Smells Like Children. The only songs worth listening to after SLC were quiet songs like ""Man That You Fear"".If you want to listen to good, HEAVY Manson, pick up Portrait of an American Family, his first and best CD, by far. This collection only has two songs on from PoaF: ""Get Your Gunn"" and ""Lunchbox"". Cake and Sodomy and Cyclops are much better songs from that album.Pick up Portrait of an American Family instead."
2,What a racket!!,"Whats the point of this satanist actor?His musics pretty good and he's quite a thoughtful and knowledgable man, not my cup of tea, but talk about a nice big blop of muddy cake.It all sounds the same after a while.""Personal Jesus"" is dreadful, and all that gore and shock horror rock carry on, he was relevant at a time with ""antichrist superstar"" but now its just more of the same carry on."
1,Typical sell out garbage for brainwashed teens,"This CD pulls together all the reasons why shock rockers like Manson are nothing but sell out poseurs. His image overshadows the music and his image is a manufactured rip off of TRUE artists like Alice Cooper and David Bowie. Only dumb teens mad at mommie and daddy for taking their xbox away could relate to this mish- mash of ""Satanic"" posing and posturing.No reason to go over the songs since everyone has probably heard them already and either loves them or hates them. I hated this crap. Give me Cooper, Bowie, or The Vampire Lucan Wolf anyday."
1,Good god...,"really don't get this type of music. This little albino goth is just screaming into a microphone. His music videos are just distirbing. I really dont like this.REAL rock music is seventies rock. Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Hendrix all saw the true meaning to music. And Plus they all knew how to use thier instruments. I KNOW that all you gothic manson lovers are reading and thinking you want to kill me. Well I dont care. I don't see how you like this. And I garuntee you it will be dead soon, and you will wonder why you even liked (...).Peace and Love Goths."
5,Good Movie,LL Cool j At his acting best it's like the part was written with him in mind and nobody could have played it better definitely worth watching You don't know what your missing
3,If only for Gene Anthony Ray,"The only reason I got this was because of Gene Anthony Ray in a very minor role. I could have cared less about LL running around without a shirt on or him doing the damn thang with Victoria Dillard (Spin City) on a picnic table.It's directed by Debbie Allen and prodcued by Tim Reid. As far as I am concerned, this should be in your collection because black people are behind the scenes."
1,Why Bother?,"It's you basic email program, it does absolutely nothing special, except cost a fortune. Try the free program Thunderbird, it is made by the same folks who make the web browser Firefox. Works very well and its free. Excellent interface"
5,lifew saver,this was such a lifesaver.I bought a black berry storm to replace my treo and I unfortunately have windows vista. so I can't hotsync my treo with the computer. I have over 1000 contacts and 500 memos. I was able to manually type them into the computer rather than the black berry by hand. I am so happy I bought this.
3,Is it compatable with Office 2007 for home and student package?,"In a few days I'm going to be receiving a new computer with Office 2007 for Home and Student. Outlook is NOT part of that version of office. I have two important questions since I am considering adding Outlook to my system.1. Is the student version of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint the same as what comes in the professional edition? In other words, does the student version have all the same features as Word, Excel, and Powerpoint in the professional edition... or is it just that Powerpoint is not included in the student edition?2. Is Outlook fully compatable with with the student version of Office 2007?On my existing computer, I have the Professional edition of Office 2003Thanks!"
1,"oh, the horror! Outlook 2007 & Vista","What a disappointment. I have a dual-core, 2GHz processor, 2GBytes of RAM, and Outlook 2007 on Vista is too slow to use. When I try to compose an email, the busy cursor is almost only on. When it goes out, all that I have to do to bring it back is enter a single key stroke. It cannot begin to keep up with my typing, and editing a typo is impossible.I've turned off as much of the indexing, as many of the widgets as I can, disabled all the RSS feeds, etc., but no joy.At this point, I'm hoping a service pack will fix my problem, but I am not a happy camper."
5,Outlook is even better now,"I have tried them all and keep coming back to Outlook.Microsoft got it right with this product.The spell checker is even better now, recognizing such things by context as form when it should be from.It also does a much better job of checking only the newly added text instead of trying to check the entire thing including previous included text.The Office 2007 Ribbon interface is a bit of a learning experience but is well worth the effort.You are allowed to activate 2 copies , one for the laptop and one for the desktop is my setup. I would not have bought it if not for that and suspect many others feel the same way."
3,having problems with Outlook,"The plastic case arrived cracked, but I don't know if this had anything to do with the operation of the product.Sometimes Outlook won't open. Then it tells me to open in safety mode.It takes a long time to download incoming mail.I didn't have problems with Outlook Express and I'm disappointed I have them with Outlook."
4,Microsoft Outlook,"Amazon has best software prices. Warning: You will have to call the Microsoft tech line to help you get your emaial function to work. I'm pretty software savvy, but I quickly realized that the 2007 with Vista was not that easy to get going.Microsoft's tech group is excellent and once you're on, you'll love the new features."
4,Organization,"My husband and I both have blackberrys, so we use Outlook to sync our schedules. There are some new features to the updated version, but it is easy to pick up."
2,Don't rush out to buy it,You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have.15 years of Outlook and you can't print a single address label or an envelope with one click. (or 10 clicks for that matter)There is no function to easily print out mailing labels either.Lets remember Outlook is a Contact manager ... next to many other things...Maybe Outlook 2010 will be the answer.
4,Does what it's supposed to do.,Microsoft Outlook does everything it's supposed to do. It merges information and helped me sync my PDA phone.
4,Ok but didnt buy it for it original use.,We purchased this as it was needed for my wifes blackberry and while Outlook seemed to work fine the interface between the phone and the desktop version never really worked as well as we would have liked
3,More recent not always better,MS seems to think newer and more is better. I got this so my wife could read docx files that she receives. We used to use Office 97 and that still works fine except where MS screwed up file compatibility.
5,Everything I expected!!,"I purchased this program after attending a class on how to use it correctly. I hadn't known what I was missing,by using ""Outlook Express"" and ""Windows Mail"" up 'til now!"
4,Microsoft Outlook 2007,I have always used Outlook too bad it doesn't still come with Office software. I guess it is a sign of the times
2,Not for people new to Word,"This is a good product if you are familiar with current word procedures and functions.No handbook or instructions are included and would have to be purchased separately. I had not used word since 95, and had a very hard time figuring out what was needed to be done to make the type of document I wanted.I was disappointed, and still learning. Templates that are user created are available on line, which can be a security risk, and for my needs none were available."
3,It takes some getting used to....,"Overall it's a good product, Microsoft god bless them, has decided to move things around but after a short time you find the most common tasks."
5,outlook,"It is just exactly what I ordered, however, the packaging left a lot to be desired. The it was packaged in a plain uncushioned envelope and arrived with the plastic case surrounding the discs totally destroyede. Fortunately the discs were still useable."
2,Outlook 2007 stopped running after automated update,"For those considering Outlook 2007, beware of my experience: one morning I ran Outlook 2007 to find it would not download email messages at all. (I would get an error about MAPI.) This appears to be due to an automatic office update of the junk mail filter.One of the most important features of an email program is that it doesn't suddenly stop being able to check email (imagine being on a business trip). Automatic improvements to the junk mail filter sounds great, but if that means one morning I wake up to not be able to check email at all, then the medicine is worse than the disease.The new features and changes Outlook 2007 really do not compensate for the lack of reliability. If you have another email program that works, I'd stick with it and not switch to Outlook 2007.On a positive note, I was able to fix the above problem by running repair (reinstall) from the Office 2007 install program, but this took half an hour or so to run."
2,stand alone doesn't work,"I was mistaken. I bought and installed Office Student Home edition on my 2 new Windows 7 computers. I decided I would still like Outlook for e-mail so I spent the money and bought this software. Well guess what. Since it was not purchased in a bundle, some of the features aren't functional. You can't use themes or stationery. Word will not be the text editor for e-mail. Spell check will not work without connectivity to Word. I am sure there are other missing features I haven't discovered yet. Microsoft knows all about this yet they did not make it plain enough for me. I am very frustrated with MS for this shoddy system. I bought 3 new computers for home and church in the last 2 months. If I knew how, I would rip Office out of all of them and send it back but what can I do now? BE WARNED. Oh for the old days when Office came with everything.Randy Rusconi"
2,A Giant Leap Backward,"I purchased Outlook 2007 because Microsoft has now chosen to exclude it from certain versions of Office 2007. Well, it has way less features than my previous Outlook:- no animated GIF's- no support for Outlook Personal Address Book (PAB)- the Outlook Text Editor has been eliminatedAnd now I find that if you purchase this `stand alone' version of Outlook 2007 the `Themes and Stationary' feature is disabled. It only works in those versions of Outlook 2007 that are bundled with the Office Suite, not this version!This is NOT AN UPGRADE, it's a DOWNGRADE!"
1,Useless; Do Not Buy!!,Received the software in the factory box. The seller placed a secondary sticker over the factory sticker that lists the product key needed to install the software. The secondary sticker could not be removed. Amazon also would not replace the product since the order was fulfilled by a third party.
2,Great until mail reception fails,"I got Outlook 2007 with Office 2007. As the title of my complaint states, the software seemed wonderful at first. I especially liked its capability to set up accounts. After about five months, however, reception of email became spotty, then failed altogether. A reinstallation of Office, which happened when I upgraded to Windows 7, 64-bit, got Outlook back in operation for about two more months. Microsoft's answer seems to be to sell a new version of Office. At least a stand-alone of Outlook 2010 is available. I will have to check to see whether it works with Office 2007. Stay tuned..."
1,Program would not install,I wish I could give a better review on this product but I'm unable to get it to install on my computer. It seems to have a problem with Vista and my student edition of Office 2007. As it turns out Microsoft seems to be incompatible with Microsoft. Who would have thought? I've found many blogs posted by folks with the same issue but no one seems to have a good solution.
2,non opening,"I guess it's alright, but most of the time it won't open. when I boot up my computer and open outlook 2007 it works. If I close it , it won't open again and I will have to reboot the computer again. I had 2003 for a long time and had no problemm with it untill it got some bug in it and I lost everything and I couldn't get it to work again.So why not update to 2007, more bells and wistles , sounded good to me but not so. I tried half a dozen cures from Google but to no avail. [...]"
5,Worth every penny,Received the product in a timely manner and had no problems loading it onto my computer and start receiving emails on Outlook.
3,Great Buy!,"I've been using MS Outlook 2010 Beta since it became available earlier this year and really like it. The Beta had a few bugs but MS will get it straightened out evenually. Anyway, I purchased the MS Outlook 2007 version because it was being offered at a lower price than normal and purchase included a free upgrade to MS Outlook 2010 when it becomes available. As of today (06/26/10) the offer is still valid and it is a good deal. Also, the 2010 version is available for download NOW. I have downloaded and installed the 2010 upgrade - it is a no hassle deal and installs clean - no problems. My advice: Buy the 2007 version at a discounted price and upgrade to 2010 for free. Amazon's free shipping makes the deal even better.I gave the 2007 version 3 of 5 stars because I only bought it to get the discounted price and the included free upgrade to 2010. The 2010 version is better and has more features."
4,Microsoft Outlook 2007,"Product was easy to install and I was up and running in no time. Had used the 2003 version previously and bought the 2007 version when I got a new PC. Not that much different then the older version. Everything transfered seemlessly. If the price would have been lower, I'd have given it 5 stars."
3,Pricey!,Needed it to sync with my smartphone. Works like the older Outlooks. This is the only program that crashes in my Vist64. You would think it should work flawlessly? Sure would be nice if Mozilla developed an Outlook alternative like Firefox for IE!!! Firefox runs even faster in Vista64!
1,Disappointed,This program is very buggy and I wish I did no even purchased and upgrade. Very disappointed
3,Cosmetic Makeover,"The new version of Outlook is VERY similar to the previous version. Cosmetics are neater, but wholesale revamping of the user interface that took place in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint missed this version. Usability is good, and I hope that security is improved, but I see no ""burning"" need to upgrade to the new version."
5,Works great side by side with Office 2003,Better interface than Outlook 2003. Cleaner with a nicer calendar. I installed Outlook 2007 and OneNote 2007 as stand-alone Office Upgrades alongside an Office 2003 install. No problems. I had seen reviews where other users say a reinstall screen pops up everytime they switch between 2003 and 2007 products. That has not happened with my install.
3,Caveat Emptor!!!!!!,"Potential buyers need to know--and Microsoft will NOT tell them--that Office 2007 products, including Outlook, do not exist side-by-side happily with older versions. For example, if you upgrade one Office product, such as Outlook, everytime you start an older Office program, such as Word 2003, it will ""reinstall"" itself. Then, when you start Outlook 2007, it will ""reinstall"" itself, etc. Furthermore, if you install an Office 2007 suite that does not include Outlook, it will be impossible to install an older version of Outlook."
2,Outlook 2007 doesn't live up to expectations,"I have used and loved Outlook for many years, along with the rest of the Office suite. To get up to date, I just bought the home & student Office suite 07 sans Outlook and bought Outlook 07 separately (thinking $200 total was better than $400). Fine - except this Outlook doesn't hook up with the suite, won't let me set default fonts, and is driving me nuts. I sometimes receive a message in white font on white and can't read it until I hit forward to put it into a message whose font I can change so I can finally see it. I looked it up on Microsoft. It's designed to act this way. Thumbs down."
4,Version Warning - No CRM,"This was the only Outlook 2007 version listed for sale on Amazon, so I ordered it. Found that it does not have Customer Relationship Management (which MS refers to in Outlook as Business Contact Management). I have since found that BCM probably would have been a useful tool in managing my 1500+ contacts. So if that is important to you, order ""Outlook 2007 with BCM"" from a vendor that offers that version. Amazon should state somewhere in the product description that this version does NOT have BCM."
4,Good and Reliable,After a four year hiatus of not having MS Outlook available it was great to have the program available for my use again. This product does what it is supposed to do and does it very well. The installation is very easy with the program taking care of itself. I am using Windows 7 and there have been no problems. As my needs are constantly changing I find MS Outlook a sutable solution to scheduling and keeping track of appointments. I have found the Outlook 2007 to be a great improvement over previous versions and very user friendly. I recommend this product to anyone needing an email and calander management system.
3,The standard for office suites unfortunately,"MS Office is THE standard for office suites which is really saying no one is trying very hard. Office 2007 user interface is vastly different from Office 2003. The menus are based on logical grouping vs function which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Once you get used to where things are it's not that big of a problem. I would like to see better integration between apps instead of the clunky embedding process. If I can create a table in Word, why not just create a spreadsheet with Excel driving it? What is really needed is one single app (or interface) that does all the major functions (word processing, spreadsheet, typesetting, slides) without having to open separate apps. You would think that MS, with all of it's inside knowledge of their OS and apps could make that work."
4,Much better than Windows Mail,"I've liked the other versions of Outlook and decided that I needed the new one (since I have Vista). It loaded easily and the look of it matches my Word program. Working with it for about a week, it is easy to use and add accounts and new schedules.My order reached me sooner than I thought.Overall, I am very pleased."
5,LOVE this latest version.,"For what I use Outlook for, I guess the best change is the asthetics. I find this program easy to use to keep my life organized and it works beautifully with my HP iPAQ111."
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this software. Microsoft is usuall a good product, however Outlook 2007 is awful. I had Outlook and was having problems, so I upgraded. Because I have Windows XP I had to get a service pack just to make it work. It is slooooooow, it frezes, there are too many layers to go through and nothing works smoothly on this software. It's just terrible."
4,Microsoft Outlook 2007,Pretty much works same as previous version. Looks have changed via the ribbon; which is the same for all Office 2007 products.
2,Unbelievably slow,I added Outlook 2007 to the Office 2007 I installed which didn't come with Outlook. I had been using Office 2003 with Outlook 2003 on an XP system and it had worked fine.Outlook 2007 is incredibly slow to start downloading emails and slow for each email. It may take it 5 minutes to download a couple dozen emails-no attachments or anything. These will download with Mozilla Thunderbird in maybe 20 seconds. And during that time it basically locks up everything else you want to do until it is finished. I've tried turning off everything that has been suggested that may be slowing it down but no success.I'm now using Thunderbird for my emails. Outlook 2007 was so slow the frustration level just got too high.I don't recommend buying this. Outlook 2003 was just fine but Outlook 2007 is a disaster on my machine.
2,Poor performer,"Microsoft Outlook 2000 still has a tendency toward locking up and is very slow. I would appreciate a better, more reliable program."
2,Overpriced low value,I bought this product for a specific purpose and later realized that it was not everything it was suppose to be. It was very expensive and had very little utility.
1,overpriced,"I bought this program (Outlook) and found it to be of little real value.Wish I could get a refund from the ""richest guy in America."""
1,Amazon will not stop spamming me,I purchased Outlook from Amazon.com. It was the first thing I've ever purchased from them.Now they are spamming me and I can't seem to get off their email list.This is the lastest insult. They want a review from me.Please take me off your email list!
3,"Great Design, Installation Issues","Outlook has the right mixture of features, so much so that one would think an open source product would come along with the same (even improved) features. I had a problem with installation--corrupted profile record and/or registry defect--due to inadequate documentation and, apparently, some sort of core coding issue. It required more than a week to find a solution, ultimately getting to Microsoft phone support through an indirect manner. Support did fix the problem quickly and without charge."
5,Outlook Leads the Way,"You cannot go wrong with Outlook. The feature set is so great, and the support so good, that all others pale in comparison. Mozilla Thunderbird is a close second, but lacks the simplicity of Microsoft support, and has no easily installed or configured backup solution that I can find.As usual, Amazon provided me with the best price and delivery options of online resellers."
2,Great features but very unstable,"I purchased Word 2007 and Outlook 2007 as they link (or are supposed to) with some other software I use regularly at my office. The link for Word has never been a problem but only some of the features of Outlook 2007 actually work with that software. For example, the calendar in Outlook is supposed to sync with the calendar in that program (PCLaw). It never has.I have found that Outlook 2007 is very unstable as well. It is very prone to lock up. Also, quite frequently, I will have to open it in safe mode as it tells me the program did not exit properly the last time. Even more annoying is that Outlook 2007 will suddenly not allow me to click on a link in an email even though the program allowed it in a previous email. A reboot may or may not solve that problem.Overall, I need that program for the links to PCLaw, but it has been a very frustrating program."
1,Moving at the speed of turtles,"The Business Contact Manager was a huge disappointment! Clunky, not-intuitive, and SLOW. I spent half of my time using it waiting for it to catch up.How about getting some of those Google minds into Microsoft?"
3,Microsoft Outlook 2007,"Screens are not as intuitive as I think they ought to be, but it does allow me to sync my ipaq. Had it not been required to sync, I would never have spent the money on this software..."
3,Wait for Vista improvements before buying,"Albeit this is obviously a MS product, it is not fully compatible with the ""upgrade"" versions of MS Windows Vista (at least the ""Ultimate"" version). Something went awry with the installation process to the extent that not all of the features are available, just to mention a few of the headaches I've encountered. See my review on MS Vista for further details. Tech support has been trying to fix this problem for over two weeks now, and as of my last conversation with them, it will perhaps spill over into three weeks before they are able to make any determination of what went wrong. It's possible I will ultimately be forced to undergo a ""full"" or ""clean"" install of Vista, which also means reinstalling all of my software."
5,Outlook 2007,"Works better than the previous version it's a shame that the previous version of Outlook will not work with Office 2007. but they have improved the latest version, so it was worth the money. Amazon had the best price I found for other than a student copy."
3,Outlook 07,"works good except trying to fine tune it and get rid of Windows live has not happened and cant find a microsoft person to help. the way it always is, cant find expert microsoft help. apple has the experts at the apple store, microsoft help no were to be found."
5,Great update to an old standard,"I upgraded from Outlook 2002 and have enjoyed the easier to use ribbons that have replaced the pull down menus that are standard on the previous versions and most software. While the ribbons are not available on the main page, they are there for reading and composing email, contact etc. The ribbon is the biggest improvement over previous versions I have used.Microsoft Outlook 2007"
3,Outlook 2007,"While the product was received very promptly after purchase and installed easily, I am not using it as my default email program. I love many of the features of this program but email that I send to others does not display properly unless they are running the same program. This version does not use stationery and does not slow Gifs as they are intended to display. For me, I use the calendar and contact information as well as some of the other features but I miss my old Outlook Express."
4,Very Good Product,"I've used Office 2003 for years and loved it and I must admit that I had some difficulty adapting to Office 2007 Word, the program I use most for my studies. However, I have to say that once I customized the Quick Access tool bar, I was able to accomplish most of my tasks more quickly than previously. While it took some time to feel even remotely comfortable with this program, it was definitely worth the effort. I would recommend that anyone currently using Office 2000, XP or 2003 get familiar with the Quick Access Bar and customize it to suit individual needs and then minimize the ""ribbon"" which has nore features than the average person either needs or wants. Definitely a great product."
3,outlook 2007,I did have a bit of difficulty loading the software. I kept getting an error message and finally I repeatedly clicked on ignore and it loaded. Seems to work fine now.
2,a word of caution,"Insert those Encarta CDs into your PC and you will notice, that not one, but two installation processes start. Microsoft updates your system with Internet Explorer 6.0 and Oulook Express 6, deleting scores of registry entries and seriously ""updating"" your system settings.There is NO hint that this will happen, there is no way to stopp it and it's irremovable. The new explorer crashes frequently on my system, it's much slower and a million things go wrong that worked perfectly before.The content on the other hand is closely focused on use in schools and is so politically correct that it will hardly satisfy any critical mind."
3,Kind of disappointed,"I thought it'd be a complete one but it turned out to be something filled with outdated data. If you read a review about a country (that you know well) besides USA, you'll be disappointed easily.So, I don't recommend this product. Bad!!"
2,Clunky,"The product is functional; however, the way the information is presented is clunky and navigation is akward. I have tried to use this product with my 10 year-old on projects and 90% of the time Wikipedia is more useful."
4,Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 2003,"I'm sorry my english is very little, but I need buy the ""Enciclopedia encarta deluxe 2003 in spanish, a friend recomended thisproduct, I need send to Nicaragua but write in spanish.spanish: Me gustaria saber si tienen esta enciclopedia en españolThank you: Sincerely Ronald Perez"
4,BRING IT ON HOME TO ME,"THIS SONG HAS A LOT OF MEMORIES FOR ME. IT WAS THE LATE 60'S WHEN WE WOULD HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD PARTIES, ALL THE KIDS WOULD STAND IN TWO ROWS AND DANCE UP AND DOWN THE LINE. THAT IS WHEN NEIGHBORHOOD PARTIES WERE FUN AND SAFE. I TOLD ALL MY FAMILY TO LOOK UP AMAZON.COM BECAUSE THEY WILL FIND ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. I AM LOOKING FORWARD IN BUYING IN, YOU CAN'T FIND THIS CD ANYWHERE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING SUCH A GREAT SELECTION."
2,Not applicable for modern recreational indoor soccer,"When I began looking for information about indoor soccer I got this book. It does not contain what I was looking for. It was originally written in Dutch and translated to English (which I did not realize at the time). There is some useful information here, but not enough to inform the reader about modern day North American indoor soccer.After reading this and all the other books on indoor soccer (of which there are very few) I embarked on the mission to find out everything I could about indoor soccer. The result of my research is here:Indoor Soccer: Strategies and Tactics."
3,Law for Business,"The Book was returned without having used it because it was the wrong edition.Where as the Book wanted for the purpose was the 16th Edition, the Book that came was the 13th Edition hence the return.As a result of the mix-up it is difficult to write a meaningful review."
1,Advertised one but got another!!!,"I ordered this book under the impression that I was getting the book they showed me. Although when I received it, it was 2 editions earlier than what I needed! Thanks a lot. I missed numerous assignments and had to drop the class I needed the book for so I wouldn't fail and mess up my GPA. In the end, they told me to keep the book and gave me my money back. I would not recommend this company to anyone nor would I buy from them ever again."
3,Not understandable,"I found the book to be confusing in most cases. It would seem as though it would make runaround in descriptions. It would try to explain things in to much detail, thereby confusing the hell out of you."
5,Law made simple.,"This introductory book makes learning the basics of business law simple and easy. I like the glossary, it makes finding the meanings of the unfamiliar words easier."
4,Good for quick reference.,"This was a required book for my Degree. Most of the book is everyday common sense, however it doesn't go into deep detail. Ok for quick reference of terms."
4,One of the best books I've puchased and I've purchased many over the past several years of undergrad and grad programs...,This is a great book for its purpose--a condensed no fluff instruction on business law. My only complaint is that it should be available in hard cover. I'll certainly keep this reference for some time.
5,Oakie it aint!,"If someone would have told me that my new favorite CD was going to feature a guy who plays banjo singing songs about the dust bowl settlers coming to California I'd have laughed in their face. I first heard Chris at a music festival in Chico CA. He was alone with an impressive array of guitars, a banjo, and some hybrid acoustic/steel body thing I had never seen nor heard of. Not only was he not ""Oakie"" like I might have expected... He rocked. OK so I bought the CD and it blew me away. Chris clearly had fun with this project, the music moves from haunting intro's to knee slapping jams. If Pink Floyd had been around in the 1800's, this is probably what they would have sounded like. It is an intelligent expression of a rather unusual subject... not what I would have expected at all. Now I am just itching for more, I can't wait for the sequel: ""Exodust"" to be released! Check it out."
3,The price is right,"Having purchased and listened to many, many cd's on African and Afro-centric music this one rates right down the middle. While not electrifying (as some are) this gives you a middle of the road. text-book overview of ""tribal music"" in Africa. I have found on many of this type of compilation that many of the titles are mediocre at best. I would highly recommend the cd, ""Africa; Music of a Continent"" that accompanied a African Arts show in London. I would also like to see more liner notes on the tribes themselves w/ their histories, i.e. The Griot of West Africa. All in all $4.00 + shipping is pretty much a bargain, especially if you will be using this for a classroom."
4,Good music and features Babatunde Olatunji,"This is the same CD as ""All The Best From Africa"" but at a lower price. Why? Don't know. I would have given it a five star but a lot of the songs fade out long before they are done. It has a good selection of different kinds of music, vocal, percussion, string, etc. The main reason I like it so much is that it features Babatunde Olatunji on tracks 2,3, and 14-20. This is rarely heard Baba music especially to those only familier with his ""Drums Of Passion"" recordings. Some of the sound quality is not that great but I've heard much worse on other recordings. The CD also has squat for liner notes, but all in all, for the price, it's definately worth it."
1,Lowsy lounge music,Gillespie's effort to approach more commercial area should be avoided by his fans.If you're into fusion I guess you might like this CD...
5,Great Vintage Collection of Tarzan Tales inside the Earth!,"I always enjoyed Tarzan running around the jungle etc etc but when he made his way ""back into a land time forgot"" in the Pellucidar series of tales at the earth's core fighting dinos and sabertooths and mastodons and cavedudes -- well, heck! How cool was that! So get the series of tales here all together."
3,Good general guide book,"This book is Primarily just a general book about dogs. I was looking for a book specifically about Lhasa Apsos. There is some background material about the breed at the beginning of the book. There are some good tips and pictures about grooming a Lhasa with long hair. (My Lhasas do not have long hair.) There really aren't a lot of books about Lhasa Apsos but, as the book points out, there were not really any records kept about them for centuries. All in all, the book is good."
3,Price or Performance??,"We all want that extra performance in our games and that extra few seconds off loading times, but with this Pc800 RDRAM, is it really worth the price? Certainly, the RAM provides the needed performance, with the coolant system that keeps it running extra-fast. However, this is one of the more expensive sticks of average RAM on the market. In addition, it has ECC-Error Correction Control, which, in my opinion limits the maximum performance a stick of RAM can give. Nevertheless, most home users and gamers will be satisfied with the performance they receive from this product. For potential buyers, you must weigh the cost and the performance. In my opinion, both these factors equal out, which is why I gave the product 3 stars, right on the fence."
5,"This is a MUST have cd, don't miss out!!",Having been an Edwin fan for a few years now I have to admit he has topped himself again! This cd is amazing to listen to. Edwin brings such energy to the songs you can actually feel what he is trying to put across with his lyrics. Craig with his sax is breathtakingly wonderful. The whole band has got it going on! This is going to be a #1 cd and I suggest you hop on with Edwin because once you listen to this cd you can't help but know he is an amazing artist with so much talent.
5,The Best Yet,"I have been a fan of Edwin for only a short time, however, I have bought a few of his cd's and think this is the best one yet. I love that he ends it with ""Maggie Mae"" just like he ends his concerts. I have seen him in concert and I must say that no cd could do his live performances justice. If you get the chance to see him, do it, you wont regret it. Still waiting for the live cd."
4,"""I'll Be"" darned, I can't find a single.","Edwin McCain plays intelligent pop music. He appeals to those with good music taste while playing basic structure acoustic pop songs. What is it? Maybe it's his voice, fabulous. Maybe it's his simple songs about the world, written with just enough creative spin to make the words interesting. But, whatever it is, he's great at it. As far as this particular CD, it's not going to bring him any more popularity. There's no standout single on it, which probably means no radio time for Edwin. But, if you enjoyed his past efforts, you'll find more of the same on this album. If you're a first time listener, pick up ""Messenger."""
5,YOU MUST GET THIS by D Hanson of Piney Point MD,"This CD, Scream& Whisper, is categorically brilliant. Edwin McCain Band has out done their selves again. Edwin McCain is a fantastic storyteller, poet, and songwriter. His music has a mixture of sounds: jazz, soul, and rock. Edwin's lyrics come from his heart and tell a meaningful message that is poetic and set masterfully to music. Of course this CD wouldn't sound as it does without Larry Chaney, Craig Shields, Lee Hendricks, Dave Harrison, and Pete Riley. This CD is definitely a must have for any person who is not only an Edwin McCain fan but also a music lover in general. Check out his other CD's: Honor Among Thieves, Solitude, Misguided Roses, I'll Be, Messenger, Far From Overand Austin Sessions."
1,"If you love Messenger, this CD is not for you.","My husband and I love Messenger, so much so it's on our iPod. After reading many favorable reviews for Scream & Wisper on Amazon, we happily purchased the CD, thinking it would be simular to Messenger. It's not. Scream & Wisper is mostly loud pounding music. After hearing it one time, we were so disappointed we tossed it."
2,Very Disappointing CD,"Edwin is one of my favorite artists. I got a pre release version of the CD and put it right in my car player. It was OK and that is not good enough from Edwin. The more I listened the more I thought ""he's going to lose his record deal after these last 3 bad outings"". Then I found out he lost his deal before this recording. Songs all sound the same -- writing is very uneven. Messanger is an awesome CD - his high point but they have back slid ever since.Edwin, I love your earliest 3 CDs man, but you are losing me. Far From Over had some decent material, Austin didn't have much and this is mediocre - which is a word I never thought I would use when talking about Edwin."
5,LOVE!,"Ok so not everyone will get this but if you are looking for a great Shabbos or Yom Tov lip-gloss, this is it. Its not too thick and sticky, has a pleasant taste, its got SPF, and I am pretty sure none of the ingredients present a kashrus concern (but obviously you should find that part out from your LOR.) I use the Blistex Lip Medex everyday during the week but since its not a gloss I can't use it on the weekends. I used to use the costmetic type of roll ons on Shabbos but my lips would get SO dry. This is perfect. Totally worth it to buy the 12 pack, keep one in your Shabbos travel bag, gift them to friends, etc.I highly recommend."
5,Roll on applicator :),"You can purchase these locally at Albertson or Homeland if you wanted to try them out first.As far as I can tell, these are the only roll-on chapsticks out there. The formula used is light and feels like a liquid. I prefer this formula because traditional chapsticks tend to melt, magically collect lint in my pocket, or become messy with balm buildup on the cap. This chapstick might not be for people with dry lips or want superior protection, but it is great for maintenance or moisturizing.PROS:+light, clean feeling+doesn't melt in your pockets or car+roll on applicator, biggest plus for meCONS:-protection not as good as other lip balms"
5,Blistex lip infusion,Absolutely the best lip balm I have ever used. I would never get through a NE Ohio winter without it
2,Not that great for chapped peeling lips,"Ohk...my lips recently got sunburned and the few vodka shots i had later surely didnt help things. So now i got painful, dry, peeling lips. I saw this product while checking out at the local walmart and picked it up. I have bought it previously and dont really remember anything good nor bad about it from that time. Anyways, this feels great as soon as you put it on but within a minute it has soaked up the liquid and your lips feel even more parched than before! Even when you add more right away it doesnt seem to improve. I am extremely disappointed with this product but the price isnt bad at $2.49. Additionally, my daughter, whose lips are not chapped loves it...go figure!"
3,"works great first time, but how sanitary?",The liquid here works great. But I question the container design. It uses a metallic roll-on and a container top that touches the metallic roll-on. Forget about the Blistex for a couple of months and reuse it-- I wonder how many old bacteria remain? Needs to provide caution or redesign.
3,Average sounds,This has some interesting storms but I do not play it a lot.I will look for a better one in the future.
4,Good CD to sleep to,The CD consists of a steady rain sound with a little thunder and a little animal sound. The rain sound is just okay. The CD is a good CD to sleep to. A big plus is that the CD is quite inexpensive. Rating 4.
2,They call this rain?,I listened to this to help me with sleeping a solid eight hours but to me the rain on this CD sounds like static. So it didn't really help me to get 8 hours of sleep - I figure I get 6 hours of sleep sometimes 5 - the healthy amount of sleep a person should have is 8 hours. So in 10 years I've lost 1 year of sleep & with my life the way it is I should be trying to sleep through as much of it as possible (Ha!).
2,No Tropical Storm here,"I like rain and thunder sounds. However, I would like to ask: where did they record this so-called storm. In my native Central America storms sound terribly beautiful: powerful thunder and noisy rain and all the stuff. Not like this poor CD."
1,Where are the thunderstorms?,"This cd is terrible. It is basically an entire cd of nothing but rain. There are a couple of thunderclaps here and then, but %99 of the cd is just rain."
2,This is NOT a cd of thunderstorms but showers,"This CD isn't bad, just not of thunderstorms. It is a cd of rainshowers with some thunder. The constant rain sounds more like static, like when your cable goes out. I was disappointed."
1,Rain/Thunder CDs,"I have this cd and another (forgot the name). Won't buy another. Thunder is too loud to sleep by, and when you turn down the volume, the rain sounds are so low you can't hear them."
3,Is the title meant to be ironic?,"I was hoping this cd would have lots of rainstorms and lots of thunder. Now I do not mean to say I wanted some kind of sound effects record, but something to make me feel as if I am listening to a proper thunderstorm. This cd was sorely lacking in that aspect, but overall it was a decent 'sounds of' type cd."
2,too noisy,"I thought this would be a thunderstorm recording with a lot of rain and waves etc. but it has all these crickets chirping and its annoying, I don't want to listen to bugs. Besides for that it gets really loud and then soft, I bought it to go to sleep by, no way. Some people would like this recording because it really sounds like nature but its too much ""nature"" for me."
5,relaxing,verry relaxing i like to listen with a sleep timmer as a drift away to sleep at night really helps me sleep. most people wouldnet like that but im odd i guess if you cant sleep i recomend getting a nature sound track of some sort.
3,"Plenty of rain, not enough thunder","I bought this cd for my husband, who has insomnia. The sound of summer thunderstorms helps him sleep, so it looked like a great idea!The cd itself is not bad. The rain falling is steady and soothing to me. My husband says he would have liked a track with a lot more thunder in it, however. On the last track there are these annoying birds chirping for a few minutes and they never fail to wake us both up, but overall, I'd say it's a decent relaxation cd!"
3,Thunderstorms,"Nice, in that there is no music, but just natural sound. Not terribly exciting though."
2,Static and thunder,"If you're expecting the sound of a thunderstorm, forget it. What you get with this cd is the sound of constant static and intermittent thunder. The thunder is pretty good, and at the very beginning and end you get some assorted bird noises. But the rain? What a mess! Static, nothing but static, and it doesn't even vary to try and pretend it's rain -- frankly, if I'd wanted static I could tune my radio to it for free. Skip this one."
2,Echoes of Nature: Thunderstorm,Not enough thunder. The long periods of rain sounded like static. Dissappointing.
4,Very good shoes,"These shoes are very comfortable, perfect for everyday use. Very soft. Ventilation openings are very handy. You never get tired of wearing these shoes."
5,Friday Night Lights,I got this as a Christmas gift for a ardent fan of the series. It will be well received and enjoyed by all.
3,TANGLED TANGO,"I approached this CD with much anticipation seeking more tango tantalization along the lines of the outstanding ""Otros Aires"" or the godfathers of the nuevo tango wave ""Gotan Project"".The resulting listen,whilst ""satisfying"", wasn't quite the audial orgasim I was hoping for.In common with alot of ""compilations"" by various artists,it was somewhat patchy,especially at the end when normally I'm expecting the best till last....It showcases alot of new artists(for me at least) & several styles of tango production which either you like or not as the case may be.There are several Astor Pizzolla standards given the new contempoary beat treatment .. unfortunately not as successfully as Otros Aires .. the stand out track for me being Astors ""El Tango"" & ""Libertango"".Bottom line .. if you seek new tango magic get hold of ""Otros Aires"" & take a look at the ""Bandoneon Tango Electro"" compilation... !!"
5,One of the best games ever!,"OK, i really like this game. This game is an exelent space combat game. I really suggest you play it with a joystick, but its fun to it without a joystick. Buy this game! NOW!"
2,"The bottom is embossed with ""MADE IN CHINA""","I was embarrassed to give this to my stepmother for Christmas. I didn't realize it was embossed ""MADE IN CHINA"" on the bottom. I was very disappointed; it's a deal-breaking blemish on an otherwise nice piece."
4,cow charm,"just the right size, well done, very clever, a conversation charm for any bracelet, granddaughter will enjoy it, I'm sure......"
5,Cow charm,This is a perfect size solid charm that looks the same on either side. Silver is nicely finished and the enamel is a nice highlight. Really looks like the picture.
4,excellent purchase,"great purchase, they sent me the wrong intake but still worked excellent. substancial notice in throttle response and mileage increase, must purchase after upgrading exhaust though to notice mileage increase"
2,Flimsy,"The title says it. Flimsy and cheesy looking. Yea, ya get what ya pay for most of the time. I ended up getting a stailess canister rather than put this in my classic."
2,It was sitting on my shelf unopened....,".. and brand new; I decided to give it a whirl.There was a little bit of leakage from the unit, but nothing unmanageable, and it did indeed make excellent espresso. Yes the metal cup (and plastic assembly) inside does get hot, but so do the parts from a ""regular"" espresso maker. A quick rinse in warm or cold water does the trick before fully disassembling. On my next attempt, I made the base tighter and voila! No leakage. Except that it only makes one shot, this is a very neat gadget. I guess it's too bad that it didn't catch on.... Ok now that it's been here awhile...Pain in the patootie to use, and the espresso is really not very good. Now I'm sure I know why it's discontinued."
3,Frother mystery,"The product is OK, but when the frother comes apart, beware...no instructions and I have tried every which way to put it back together without success. Searched online and many others have same problem."
5,ATrue Rapper,"Mr. Lif (A fine and fellow bostonian) shows hip hoppers can rhyme and spit knowledge without rappin' about cars or money. Lif accompied by other tight rappers shows true rhyming abilities. Dont let the few number of tracks turn you away from it, it's an album you can bounce to all the way through (hidden tracks pay mad hommage to bean town) big ups to lif and anyone who picks up this hot album."
5,Real Hip Hop,"Honestly, Mr Lif has to be one of the greatest MCs on the scene right now. His delivery and the images he creates are sick. I read an interview he did last year...and the guy is super intelligent. Such a shame that kids think that P.Diddy, Nelly and Jadakiss are real hip hop. Lif could squash those cats...easy. Every track on this EP is a banger, as is everything Def Jux/Ozone releases."
4,My introduction to Lif.....shook me,I slept on boston hip hop for real...but Lif singlehandedly readjusted my perceptions of the scene there.......This album is a classic...just too short....so buy the Live at the Middle East album for a follow up and then just wait patiently for Liffy's next jawn just like i am.Peace
1,Very Poor Recording Quality,"--I have written a review on this twice and for some reason Amazon.com has chosen not to publish my review.This recording is meant to be a meditation tape and not music or entertainment. Therefore, audio quality is essential to effectiveness of the product.Stacy Dean sounds as if she is very dehydrated and the thick mucous in her mouth makes clicking noises as she speaks. This is highly distracting in a MEDITATION recording.I do not recommend that anyone purchases this. Note that audio sampling is not available for this. The most probable reason that you are not given the opportunity to listen before purchasing is that the quality is extremely poor for meditation.I would give it zero stars if possible."
5,Why ~ DJ Sammy,"Why~ DJ Sammy is a great trance cover of Annie Lennox smash hit of the early 90's. The lyrics are amazing, and the chick that covers the track is just as good a singer as Annie Lennox. I love this up tempo version of this modern classic and this should be obligatory for private parties and discos."
4,More Toots!,"Chez Toots is terrific, but don't expect a hard jazz album. It has a lot of traditional French music which I think is wonderful. If you are really into Toots, check out his album with Kenny Werner. It is a very well done listenable collection of songs."
4,True American Heroes,"In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, all Americans developed an appreciation for true American heroes---fire fighters. Long before that day, Karen Kruse knew the character of fire fighters and what it takes to join their ranks. In her book ""A Chicago Firehouse,"" she tells of the hearts and souls of all fire fighters. Yes, it's the tale of one firehouse, but that firehouse captures the spirit of firehouses across America and throughout our history. As Karen presents fire fighting, she defines familiar words and terms we thought we knew. The book is highlighted with dazzling photography from aged newspapers and Karen's own camera. Her unique perspective of growing up in a fire fighting family brings a loving touch to a moving story. Here's a tribute every fire fighter would love to own."
4,Good reading,"Not completely what I expected. I enjoyed the story as it relayed to the Fire Dept, but didn't need the in depth descriptions of the different graves in the cemeteries. I felt the story got off track at that point."
3,"It's not the best, but worth a look, and the girls are hot","This is not on my list of favorite movies, but it is at least enjoyable. And the actor who plays Benny has talent. Where is he now, when we're seeing the same faces over and over in movies?For me, though, the main thing here was the girls. Or one girl in particular. Claudia Kaleem was mucho calliente as the girl of Benny's dreams, but she had nothing on sexy porn star Devin Deray, who made a cameo as a stripper with enormous breasts. If you like 'em big, keep your eyes open for this scene!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"While ""Phat Beach"" has a good premise, it ultimatley goes nowhere. Throughout the film I kept waiting for it to get interesting soon, but it never did. None of the inexperienced actors have the charm ability to carry the movie by themselves. ""Phat Beach"" may have been more enjoyable if someone like Martin Lawrence or Chris Tucker starred in it instead of these inexperienced comedians. Plus, the script is extemely slow and unfunny. Some jokes had the potential to be funny, but weren't executed right, due to the director's lack of skill. I only laughed twice at the most during the whole film. By the way, the advertisements show Coolio on the cover as if he was a main character , but he actually is only in the film for about 2 minutes."
1,the worst movie ever,"this movie is the worst movie because its a skin flick that attempts to be deep, and the black stereotypes not only come awkard, but unfunnily"
1,Not the best in black movies,"I was first enticed to watch this movies because the trailers for the movie contained a lot of women in bikinis. This is not a movie worth buying. The acting is not that bad, but the writing is not good. The only thing that would have improved this movie would have been a lot of nudity but the director and producer had the dignity not to do that."
1,very predictable,with the right actor for this film like a Jamie Foxx this would have been a breakthrough film for him.but the film trys to many cliched themes done many times before.it has it's moments.Jermaine Hopkins has skills.but the sidekick was wack.i liked the Bikini Contest.but overall a Black Version of Spring Break 2 or 3.nothing special.a few good things but overall forgotten.
1,Recycled,"If you want to experience the pop and crackle of old vinyl, this is the rocording for you. This is clearly a poor job of analog to digital transfer. The music content is not too good either."
5,i like it,"Although I am hardly an authority on DIJ, I really enjoy this compilation and would recommend it to others. Perhaps because it [DISCriminate] was how I was introduced to them? I can't really compare it to their other stuff, because I like everything I've ever heard from them. I especially love when Rose McDowall sings with them. ;) I wish that the version of ""Break the Black Ice"" that she sings were on this album instead."
2,"If you plan on running, don't buy this armband.","The design of this armband makes the ipod flap against your arm. You will end up damaging the ipod. Although the armband fits well around your arm, the ipod is not stabilized. This is not the armband for runners."
4,It works ok,The band is good for the most part. Sometimes I feel it slipping so I have to adjust it. It will take some getting used to.
3,for skinny arms it's loose,"for those of us with skinny arms, it's hard to wrap it tight enough around your arm. You have to have a larger bicey to have it fit snug"
2,Not for the older 20 GB ipod with headphone jack in the middle,"I was disappointed that the wholes in the top did not match up to the middle headphone jack and the top right 'hold' toggle on my ancient 20GB ipod. I ended up clipping the top with scissors, which sort of made it functional, though it is still a pain to get in and out of hold mode. As other's have noted, it's a bit floppy if you are exercising hard, but fine for the slow jog / walk, and the front of the ipod was very visable/useable, which was a nice changed from the older holder I had that blocked the control wheel."
3,Decent but not brilliant,"Like one previous reviewer, I found the case a little difficult because you have to wiggle the iPod in and out of a tight rubber sleeve--fine if you plan to use the sports sleeve all the time, not so fine if you don't. Once you get the iPod in the sleeve, it works fine; I have small arms, but the band can be shortened significantly, so that's no problem.My assessment: a reasonable value that keeps my iPod looking nice for now, but it won't stop me from looking for ""the"" case."
3,okay product,This product is okay because it dosent really keep your ipod stable.Kind of cheap. I would go w/ something better.
4,A wonderful collection for the classroom,"As a history teacher, I am constantly on the lookout for music that can help to bring the past alive. This CD does a wonderful job for both the American Revolution and the Civil War. While the country twang of some of these pieces may jar young sensibilities, students quickly warm to the authentic verve of the performances. The Revolutionary period includes such chestnuts as the ""Riddle Song"" (and actually omits ""Yankee Doodle""), but also some jokes of the period, including a hysterical folk version of a taming of a shrew. The Civil War period is split between northern and southern songs. There are the standards ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" and ""Dixie,"" but also more obscure songs like ""Lincoln and Liberty"" and ""Goober Peas."" All in all, a great tool, especially for the price."
1,Subject to Failure,"When it worked, it was a very nice addition to my reference library.

4,Nothing Special (Batteries),This was just an order to augment another product I purchased that needed batteries. The batteries where the 1st to arrive.
5,Just ordinary batteries,"They work as they should no problems, and I most likely will order more from the same place, I use them in my remotes and my ham radio hand held.Glen S Barney KC7EQF"
3,Batteries are batteries,"Batteries are batteries, what more can you say. So far, the ones that we have used are performing in the tools in which they have been installed."
2,Smashed Box,"Sure, they're only batteries. But they're MY batteries. Packing was completely destroyed. I would not be able to put these with gifts this season."
3,So far so good,The batteries have all been good so far so I have no complaint. Batteries are batteries if they work. I could not read the date code so do not know how fresh this pack is.
3,Good disposable batteries,I needed some batteries for my Roomba Lighthouses. These are batteries. They have done the job that i would expect and came nicely packaged. They have worked as advertised.
3,Slightly unsatisfied,"Two slight problems were that the packaging the batteries came in were bent and wriggled from the shrink wrap.Not a problem unless they are displayed.Second it was not a 24 pack as advertised and pictured but rather two twelve packs of batteries.Sell what your advertising or get out, because the web has many competitors."
3,Good,"For the money this was a pretty good deal, however they only lasted me a couple of months. I only use these for flashlights and in the controller for my Xbox 360 and I rarely use either of the two. Personally I would suggest buying rechargable batteries because these dont seem to hold much value."
4,Sassy,Very good value for the price! Would order again! Would recommend for of Amazom buyers to purchase. Good price value!
2,expired batteries.,"These batteries are stamped with an October 2012 expiration date so I was not thrilled upon reciept of them. We are using them, so I can't really say how long they will last, but I just think its wrong for these sellers to knowlingly sell expired batteries."
4,just batteries,little long too ship but it was the holidays and it was shipped through the good ole mail so you cant blame too many people
5,They're batteries,"There really isn't a lot to say about the batteries except they worked as expected, shipped quickly, and were for a good price."
5,batteries,What more can I say? They worked and were at a good price without having to fight the holiday shoppers.
2,Terrible battery life.,These batteries died quickly even though I bought a name brand. I've had some off brands last longe than these.
2,what happened,didn't get what is shown. I received to packs taped together. Same amount of batteries but they had dates from different times? Guess trying to get rid of the old stock instead of the new bigger packaging.
5,Energizer i love it,How can you go wrong with energizer? They last long --great product and new....I am set with batteries for a while
1,Not one battery had any life left!!!,"The package shipped and arrived within a couple days. The battery package was exactly what you would find in any department store. Expiration date in 2017. Everything looked fine except for one thing: NONE OF THEM WORKED!!! Every single battery was dead right out of the box. I was so disgusted I took them to the nearest recycling center and tossed them in the box, so I can't comment on the return policy. STAY AWAY from buying batteries online. I have read other reviews from consumers who bought from other sellers and more than a few had this same problem. I didn't see any from this seller though. Find a coupon and buy from your local store."
1,Keep Shopping,"I thought this was a great deal for Energizer AA Batteries, buy a 16 pack of AA for $12.32 ($.77 each) until I found Rayovac 48 pack for $25.30 ($.53 each). They also come in reclose able package so after you open the pack they do not role around in your drawer. My boyfriend uses Rayovac UltraPro at work, bought them at a contractor supply store.One of my students did a battery test and found all of them work the same. Comes down to price. Sign up for ""subscribe and save"" and get 15% off too. Because these are $25.40 you get Free Freight at Amazon without having to shop for more to hit the minimum.Here is the product link.Rayovac ALAA-48 UltraPRO Alkaline AA Batteries, 48-Pack"
5,Great bargain,"The day after I ordered this Gold Box Deal, I saw one package of 12 batteries selling for more money than I paid for the 32 batteries in this order. It's a great bargain!"
5,Great batteries in a bulk at a good price,"Can't beat energizer batteries. Getting them in a bulk helps keeping some as backup when kids need them or you need them for remotes and such. When you can get them for a good price from Amazon, you can't beat the value."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE,"I have been buying items off amazon for years. It pissed me off when I spent $10 on these and I got a pack full of batteries with battery acid all over them. I'm very disappointed in amazon because of this. If you want batteries, don't get them on this website. You have better luck going to ebay and buying off someone with 1% positive feedback."
4,Batteries...not all the same!,They worked well and lasted a long time the first time I bought them. That's why I made sure to get the same ones again-good batteries!
3,Good batteries,"The batteries are excellent but the price is average but it is still better than going to the store, spending the time, and spending money on gas. I read the review about the cosco comment but getting in and out of cosco is good for several hours."
2,What you see is NOT what you get,"I was assuming I'd be getting a single pack of 24-count batteries. Instead I got 6 packs of 4-count batteries, one of which was ripped open and the batteries were moving around freely in the packaging box."
3,Have had problems wit this order,"Although I received the batteries quickly, they were the wrong ones, namely, no-Max versus Max, which I ordered (and paid). Luckily, the seller offered me a discount of 25%, which I hope will cover for me getting the inferior batteries. However, I got too much involved with this purchase, trying to get the tracking for the shipment, as well as trying to recover from the seller sending me the wrong batteries, which left me with quite sour taste in my mouth. Luckily, I will not need to purchase another pack of batteries for more than one month, until which I hope that I will find a better provider. Otherwise, the batteries have been marked as ""USE BY 2015"", which shall suffice me, provided that I received them on 1/4/2013. I can only hope that the promised life will be true."
2,Savings vs. Storage,"Stocking up on batteries and searching for the best bargain? I suggest you skip this one. I was also looking for a great deal on batteries that I planned on storing for emergency use, this was the best price I could find on 9 volts. When I received the package I checked the date of production... 2009. It is now November 2012 so these batteries are at least 3 years old maybe more. From what I have read the life span of 9 volts is about 5 years so these batteries now need to be used up pronto AND I still need to buy more for my emergency stash. Not exactly the bargain I was looking for.If you are using these immediately I have nothing negative to say. In November 2012 this was the best deal I could find on Amazon."
2,New Batteries??????,"Just got the 16 pack. Totally ripped open. Batteries spilling all over the box. They are dated to expire on 03-2018. We'll see. I've tested some. They work. But the package looks so old and beaten up that I'm wondering about the life of these batteries no matter what the expiration date is. Plus, the package contains a little plastic car from the TransFormers movie. A little dated??????? I'll post another review if this turns out to be a flop."
2,Not What I Expected!,"Batteries came in a plastic bag and when I went to place them in the air pump I purchased them for they had very little ""juice"" to them. the company said they tested the voltage and these batteries were NEW but the clearly were not!"
2,OLD BATTERIES!,"New 9V batteries are supposed to be good for 5 years or close to it, according to Energizer. The batteries sent to me were old, it says right there on the battery they expire in 3 years. I don't use 9V as often as the other sizes so I might have them for a while therefore I need maximum shelf life. Mostly they will be used in smoke detectors which take a long time to use up a battery. It's not a good deal if you end up throwing them out before having a chance to use them."
3,Sage Cuisine Art Poster Print,"Not worth paying the same in shipping as the product costs. It's cute and it works in my kitchen, but I should have gone to Wal-Mart."
5,"Finally, a really useful book for guys","As a divorced man after 10 years of marriage, I had no idea how to talk to women. Patrick's book really showed me how to connect with a woman and gave me confidence. Now, instead of talking about myself or something mundane, I really get to know the woman I'm talking to, and it's wonderful."
3,Experienced travellers may be dissappointed,"This is not a reference book - it is more a description of the authors'travels. The book was obviously written by people with a lot of time on their hands. You'll find a lot of detail about changing money and visiting markets in foreign countries, for example. Still, if you have never travelled by cargo ship before, the book contains a lot of useful information, particularly about accommodation and the lifestyle on board."
5,great,"Works great for my 9 year old's chello. High quality product, I would recomend it and my daughter has been very happy with it"
4,Economical stand for cello,"I got this for my cello so I didn't have to uncase it every time I played it. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I would have given it five stars except that the tabs on the front are a little too hard for my taste, so I was worried about dinging the finish. However, a piece of velvet draped over the tabs took care of that. It is well worth the price."
5,Perfect Gift,Got this doll for the neighbor girl because she loved playing with my daughter's Groovy Girls. She loved it! The outfit was super cute and it was a big hit.
5,Loves It.,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday. I thought that she was out of the stage of playing with dolls so much, but she is even sleeping with her Groovy Girls."
3,wrong cover,"The book is great and has great info on all the basics of becoming a social worker. However, I paid the extra bit for a hard cover and the sent me a paper back."
5,Great cd of Koto music.,The music on this cd is very good and relaxing to listen to especially with tea on an uneventful afternoon. 5-stars and hope more people enjoy this as well. Happy New Year!
1,Word is HAS NO LOGIC,"The way to create Headers/Footers in Word is illogical and with 20 years of software experience, it took 15 minutes to figure it out. MICROSOFT WORD is idiotic. I am going to wear a black arm band for WORDPERFECT. WORDPERFECT was so much better and SO MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY."
2,Office Word 2007 Home and Student Version,"Disappointing, this is not what I was looking for. The product just gave me Word. I wanted Word, Excel, PowerPoint etc."
4,Microsoft Word Home and Student 2007,"Pretty good, but needs to be a little better in it's icons and easier to use for us ""older"" students."
4,It's a plane. Plain to see this is a beautiful book.,"A beautiful book that had me utterly engrossed. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially any family suffering with congenital disease. It tells a unique, adult story in a whimsical and heartbreaking way. I love too see the graphic novel used to such affect."
1,Awful,"I feel lesser for having read this comic book. I was hoping for a different take on Superman, but all I got was a whiny, self important diatribe on Huntington's Disease. If I wanted to read a whiny, self important diatribe on Huntington's Disease I would have picked up a comic entitled ""A whiny, self important diatribe on Huntington's Disease""!I feel that somebody needs to refund me the time I wasted on this garbage. Oh and let's not forgot his jab that people that don't support illegal immigration are racist. You know, because Superman is an illegal alien. Get it?"
4,BRIGHT TRIO,"BRIGHT, ENERGETIC BUT SENSITIVE TRIO PERFORMANCES. LaVERNE ON PNO, STEVE LaSPINA - STRING BASS AND ANTON FIG - DRUMS. GOOD MIX OF STANDARDS AND ORIGINALS. LaVERNE HAS DONE SOME OF THE JAMEY AEBERSOLD CD'S AND PLAYED WITH STAN GETZ."
5,Political infighting at its best (or worst!) at CCSN,"As a student, you don't really know what goes on amongst the faculty when they decide which instructor gets what course in the next term. Sometimes the best instructors for a certain class or subject get overlooked for no rhyme or reason. Lee Miller shares about his experience working with students that wanted to learn and faculty that could care less about the dynamic programs Miller offered. Tales of backstabbing, misuse of funds, unprofessional behavior and frustration fill the pages of this book. Read it and ask yourself if you would stand up for yourself and do the morally right thing. Miller went through a lot of grief from the faculty. He found that the rigors of being a professor extended beyond the classroom but with his bosses. Let's hope that fellow instructors and educational institutions do not fall into the pit that Miller went through at CCSN."
5,Doing What's Right,"This book, while using the trials and tribulations of Academia, isn't about Academia at all. Its about doing the right thing, for the right reasons, no matter what. Lee Miller went the extra mile, and showed what he is made of. He could have been a Marine, or a Bus Driver. The message is still the same."
4,Good movie to add to my collection!,"This is a good movie, you can easily watch it, it has laughs in it, it displays real life issues that people may face, it may have one thinking about their own life. Acting was not great, but it was not terrible either. I will and (would) watch it again. I recommend getting and watching this movie. (I've seen worst)"
2,Low budget and terrible plot,I watched this because it was free but what a waste. They storyline was weak and the end was terrible. I'm still wondering what happened...
3,DIDNT LIKE,"I CHOSE THIS ITEM, BECAUSE IT WAS RECOMMENNED TO ME, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE, ITEM PACKED GREAT."
3,good storyline,"movie was decent and definitely watchable;showed most aspect of the Black culture without using obnoxiously offensive language and acting.i think it was well done considering a probable low budget.the story,about ordinary folks, is very belivable.some actors could (and woud with time )improve their acting.good job and keep it up"
5,A Must See!!!!,"Really, really enjoyed this film. A must see for anyone who wants to enjoy a decent, watchable film made on a shoe string budget"
3,Okay,"This movie had its moments. There were a few funny scenes. I love Kevin Hart, he's hilarious! Some of The story lines were a bit boring and over the top, but I found the movie to be entertaining, at the least."
5,Good and funny,I really enjoyed the movie. It was interesting and funny with a little bit of serious. Well done. Kevin Hart makes any movie funny.
4,Good comedy,"I didn't have high expectations going into this movie. But this movie was surprisingly good. Very funny but also touching at the same time. I'm a Kevin Hart fan, and of course he was great in the movie. I thought it was better than ""Think like a Man."" If you like comedies, esp black comedies, check it out. You won't be disappointed."
4,good quality product and service,the shirt fits well and didn't shrink after washingexcellent service and fast delivery
5,Wonderful,I love this flag pole holder. Its sold hard unbendable metal unlike the ones that come with the flag kits at Wal-mart. Its been up for well over 4 months now and hasn't bent. I went through 3 other holders all with a little wind bent downward ugghhh. This one has not. Well worth the extra cost...
1,I think I got duped on this product!,"I bought this because it was advertised as new and in excellent condition. Should the seller have mentioned that this book is in fact more than ""24"" years old, I might not have bought it! The minute I saw the book, I knew I got duped. It has old book smell, yellow discolorations and the cover is only half attached! The owner had written notes and underlined in the book. The worst is the original receipt was left in the book. It cost 2$ only in 1978.Consider it is old and used book and being sold as new and excellent condition, I'd say ""I got duped"""
4,pleasant surprise,"I bought this tape mainly because it had ocean waves sounds in the background, and because it was cheap. I fell in love with it, and still enjoy listening to it even though the luau theme party has long been over. the only thing keeping me from listing it as a five star cd, is that most of the songs are very slow and not too upbeat. But I'm still glad I bought it!!"
4,Perfect for Tiki Bar,"This cd was just what I was looking for: hokey traditional hawaiian songs as instrumentals, with the sound of the surf in the background. Perfect sound effects for my at-home tiki bar!"
2,"NO cool hawaiin language (no lyrics at all), every track is same, too much ocean background (used on every track I think?)","NO cool hawaiin language (no lyrics at all), every track is same, too much ocean background (used on every track I think?)"
4,Nice lazy Hawaii vacation.,Mood of lazy Hawaii vacation at the beach. Nice guitar. I wish the effect of wave sound in the background could be better.
3,Homework Purchase,"Sometimes you buy a thing because you must. The title here forms a small part of a project on Hawaii that my stepson is doing. I would love to say wonderful things about this CD, but the truth of the matter is that I'm not a fan."
4,Sounds of Hawaii,Purchased this CD for Hawaiian theme party... great collection of music and fantastic background for our party - continue to play it.
4,Great Background feel,Gives one the ambience and atmosphere of traditional Hawaii. Great as background sound for those that still talk during parties late at night.
3,How much star power does it take to make a good movie?,"Arguably the two greatest actors from my teens together again in a gritty vigilante film should be a slam dunk success, but for me it wasn't. The story is okay, not great, full of clichéd plot lines. The acting is okay, just not what I might have hoped for from Pacino and De Niro. Top that off with these super-cops being in at least their mid sixties, made the suspension of disbelief surpass any science fiction plot that I can think of.So here's my take,If you want a vigilante cop movie, (the much maligned acting of Keanu Reeves is more believable) inStreet Kingsis a much better view from last year. If you want a Super Vigilante movie, go seeTakenwhere Liam Neeson is also much more believable and also much more empathetic as the man best not messed with."
2,De Niro-Pacino Reunion Generates Little Heat,"After their memorable faceoff in director Michael Mann's ""Heat"" (1995), Robert De Niro and Al Pacino find themselves stuck in this routine cop thriller. ""Righteous Kill"" plays like a TV Movie of the Week that acquired two Oscar winners. Seeing De Niro and Pacino together again is more impressive than the film itself. Director Jon Avnet also was responsible for the Pacino turkey ""88 Minutes."" Next time around, let's hope these acting legends find a real script."
3,"3.5 Stars , Decent Movie","I'm not a fan of Pacino. I did like him in this movie. The plot has a good suspenseful twist. The acting was pretty good. This is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was entertaining and worth watching."
2,Deniro and Pacino walk thru it,"This movie wasn't bad but it was hardly the movie that you would want to see Deniro and Pacino wait so long to share screen time on. It was a pretty basic police/serial killer story that tried to keep you guessing but really has been done before. I would rather have seen them sink their teeth into something worthy of their early efforts and all we got was something that was worthy of their latest efforts which haven't been all that great. The movie had a really good cast and Carla Gugino looked great and super sexy as usual.It is worth a watch but if you are expecting The Deer Hunter, Serpico, The Godfather I or II or any other number of great films these guys have done including Heat you will be let down. It is a walk thru performance by both."
3,"Average story, superb actors","In some ways Righteous Kill is a waste of great talent. The story is conventional--a vigilante cop is killing perps who escape the legal system through technicalities. We've seen it all before. Here there is a twist--the apparent vigilante may actually not be guilty of the crimes. On that slender thread are hung the abilities of two of our greatest living cinematic actors. The film held my attention, though the subplot was shaky and the conclusion largely predictable. The supporting cast is effective and the direction is workmanlike. This is a rental."
2,You've got to be kidding,"I like interesting cop shows. I-n-t-e-r-e-s-t-i-n-g! This movie should have been called the DeNiro and Pacino Show. Couldn't figure out for the life of me why the killings could have been ""righteous"", even in serial killer terms. You were searching for a commradere between the two partners but there was always that ""guy thing"" that kept them at odds and made their partnership rather vacant for anything meaningful, especially after all those years. All the action throughout the film just seemed like a filler only until the end when it finally decided to pick up the pace. Pacino and his righteous kills didn't sound like a mystery finally unearthed but just a flat ""well here it is"". This movie could have been written better for these fabulous actors. What a shame."
2,"Boring, Unrealistic","I was immediately struck by how miscast the two stars were - both too old to be playing cops, especially Pacino. The second immediate impact was how unrealistic the plot was - that 14 murders of criminals who had gotten off would have succeeded. It was obvious almost from the start that a cop had to be doing the killing. The third point that will strike viewers is that the supposed killer, De Niro, was too obvious, and it had to be someone else."
2,Love Deniro and Pacino but...,"the movie is too predictable. If you are a big fan of either actor, I think you'll be disappointment. Not because of the acting, but the script is too predictable."
4,"""Good Thriller!""","Robert De Niro and Al Pacino star in this 2008 crime thriller.Two cops pursue a serial killer who could be a cop. It'sgreat to see Robert and Al together again and this isgood, but not as good as ""Heat"" This dvd has nicepicture and sound plus a couple neat extras.I recommend this."
2,newspapers are giving away this dvd !,"i live in istanbul -turkey....this weekend- hurriyet newspaper which costs 35 cents, gave away this dvd to the readers who paid an extra 20 cents with it! and believe me - there is a reason for it :) do i need to say more? don't waste 14 dollars on it as big names don't do justice to this movie and it should cost no more than a blank dvd...."
3,DeNiro and Pacino are dynamic in a weak film,"I watched with anticipation for the scenes between these 2 iconic actors yet in the end I was disappointed. Why? The revelation of the serial killer was just not plausible and even the performances of DeNiro and Pacino cannot cover this hole. Also why is Jon Avnet the director of this flick when he just made Pacino's horrible ""88 Minutes"", probably the worst movie Al has made since ""Revolution""? I still have hopes for these two brilliant actors since I've enjoyed their work in ""Donnie Brasco"", ""Goodfellows"", ""Heat"", ""Scent of a Woman"", etc. You'd be better off watching a re-run of ""NYPD Blue"" or ""Law & Order"". Also the fine supporting cast is pretty much wasted here (Brian Dennehy, John Leguziamo, lovely Carla Gugino and Donnie Wahlburg). Better luck next time fellows---I give this film just 3 or 2.5 for the duo!!"
2,A waste of good talent,"I really looked forward to seeing Pacino and De Niro together. This story is a sad vehicle for their talents. It's a disappointment relative to the previous work of either actor. The ""plot twist"" is not suprising or meaningful. Overall, the film leaves you wondering what was the point???"
2,"GREAT ACTORS, FAIR FILM","i love these two actors, two of the best living legends around. this movie was kind of ""bland"" , but i enjoyed these two together. if you are a true pacino and de niro fan . you would still want this movie part of your movie collection."

2,Neither DeNiro's or Pacino's best work,"I thought this would be a blockbuster but was kinda disappointed with this one. The story was weak and the ending left me with something to be desired. It played on the old story line of an over-the-hill cop who does things his own way.....how many time have we seen this in a movie! Really, I think this was just a payday for Deniro and Pacino. The movie didn't challegne these guys at all. They could have done these roles in their sleep."
3,Righteous Kill,"`Righteous Kill' is a pretty formulaic and sedate thriller starring two giants of cinema whose talents are sorely underused. Following some NYPD detectives who are tracking down a vigilante cop this film has very few surprises and you can guess the ending from about twenty minutes in. The acting is ok, but not great and although both De Niro and Pacino are legendary actors, they always feels a bit stilted and lacking of any conviction in this film. The storyline is sadly unoriginal and without any great shocks or twists, but it does keep you engaged for the 90 minutes duration. Any longer and you'd get restless though. For all it's flaws this film is not that bad overall and when you want an easy evenings viewing, where you don't have to think too hard, then this is a pretty good place to go. There are better thrillers out there and I have seen De Niro and Pacino in better films, but this is still worth a watch.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,Save your money,"Take two of Hollywood's most capable actors, both with lustrous careers behind them and... throw them together in a boring movie with a mechanical predictable script devoid of worthwhile dialog or anything at all that would enable them to shine. Add uninspired camerawork, tedious editing and mundane direction and you have Righteous Kill.DeNiro in particular should be brave enough to seek out scripts worthy of his talent. Instead he's wasting the years with third-rate sausage-machine drivel like this and like Meet The Fockers. What's the man thinking about? Unlike 95% of Hollywood stars he can really act when he wants to. Shame he's not making the kinds of movie that would be worthy of his talent. Unless you are very undemanding indeed or a certifiable DeNiro groupie this is a movie to avoid. Even the so-called ""plot twist"" at the end was boringly predictable - I called it after only 27 minutes into the film."
2,Sad to see these guys do this movie,"This movie has been done before In a dozen different ways.(The Plot)And part of what makes this so sad Is, there Is NOTHING distinguishing this movie from an 80's version of It. Not even the clothing, which seems to match all detectives. If your a fan of either star and just want this for a collection ok. OTHERWISE rent this and not be so angry you wasted good money on buying It."
5,Just the way it is.,"Some reviewers have noted that Deniro and Pacino ""sleep walk"" through this movie. I disagree. They're 30 year on the force veteran cops, who as they say themselves are ""numb"" to the violence and the system. They don't get frantic and out of control, because to them, it's all business as usual - taking out the trash. The plot is solid, if not spectacular and the acting exactly what I would expect from the stars. I'm not sure if I'd call it a twist ending, as there are several ""clues"" or tip offs through out the film that might lead you to figure it out before hand. However, in a year (2008) or largly disappointing movies, this one is certainly well above the crowd and in my estimation one of the best."
3,rent when you are bored,"This movie was just average. Like most other people have said , the plot runs thin after awhile and the acting is nothing revolutionary. I'm surprised more people didn't bring up the waste of time w/ the brief sex scenes. I guess no one wants to see a 60 yr old man close to naked so they basically angle it so you just see the woman but the scenes (and the puzzling way it is initiated) just leave you scratching your head in bewilderment. If you are at the vid store and need something to kill a couple of hours with go ahead and rent it. i'd struggle to call this one a keeper. PS - tons of big stars in here, some I never even knew were part of the movie till I watched it."
4,A Righteous Man Stands Before Me,"It's Pacino and De Niro,but do not forget Gugino!Blue shield and gun consume their lives;is it a righteous kill for which they strive?Rooster and Turk, for Law they work.Solving crime should not cause a smirk.When the body count starts to grow,clues foreshadow truth that begins to show.Corpses poetic, lawmen prophetic,killers's mood becomes frenetic?Six shots and a Russian dares death.Borders, friendship, and trust gulp their last breaths.Supporting cast provides a blast.Leguizamo's name, talent vast.A villian cop, the trust betrayed,the plot twist is simple, about fifth grade.The great actors, aging they are.Catch a glimpse of the dwindling stars.With luck it's not their last hurrah,four stars out of five - for this cast, it's par."
1,bad script,"Two great actors with a really bad script, there was no suspense or a build up to understand why the characters did what they did. Both actors would have been better off playing against each other, De Niro should have played the part that Leguizamo played. The ending was bad, bad ,bad."
1,"Dumb, Boring, Tired","The only reason I wanted to see this movie (thank God I didn't buy it or see it in theaters) is because of DeNiro and Pacino. But they couldn't save this piece of trash, no one could. It is honestly so boring, I kept falling asleep and had to restart it when I woke up at least fifteen times. Finally with 20 minutes left I turned it off and took it back to the video store and asked for a credit."
5,You Numb Nuts have to be joking!!,"De Niro & Pacino were the movie they were awesome.You people take movies way to serious, instead of tryingto enjoy them.Non-stop action, suspence and had you goin one way and at the endyou find out you had it all backwards.I give the movie a 5 of 5 stars.If your a true fan of De Niro & Pacino you'll like it!!"
5,Must see,This movie has very good feel. It keeps you guessing to the very end. The ending is actually believable as well. Most movies anymore the villain and the good guy hold hands and skip off into the sunset instead of someone getting shot.
4,Childhood memories!,"Jon Avnet directed this shocking thriller with a visible approach to the documental style, giving us hints here and there that allow us to pick up the pieces of this complex and haunting story.A serial killer is cleaning up the city from well known gangsters, corrupt collaborators but at the moment a priest is murdered, the film acquires a new dimension and the awful nightmare by this victim-executor, paves the way to build a solid and penetrating portrait.It's useless to remark that both giants of acting like De Niro and Pacino ignite the screen with his well known gifts.A not so original and much less innovative Noir but it surely will keep you hold to your seat. It made me remind to ""Internal affairs"" from the early Nineties."
2,So disappointing...,"This one was just a weak as all the reviews had mentioned. How the hell could you waste the talents of Pacino and DeNiro with such mediocrity? Not awful, but awfully disappointing."
4,Another great serial killer movie,"Another great serial killer movie staring two of the BEST actors ever! I strongly recommend this movie to any fan of serial killer movies, don't believe the critics reviews on this movie! Great stars all around in this movie and Pacino/DeNiro are definitely at their best!"
1,"poor man's ""departed""","What a miserable film!This storyline was so predictable and overdone. I knew exactly how it was going to end. I guess if you watch a lot of movies it is easy to become jaded and guess endings, but this was just so lame.The acting was not bad, John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg were interesting, but overall the acting was not at the level I was anticipating. And what is wrong with Carla Gugino ... why is she picking such strange roles that showcase her physical and sexual attributes, and not her acting?I am greatly disappointed. This movie is a series of clichés strung together that was not supposed to be noticed because we were supposed to be mesmerized by the De Niro/Pacino combo. Like I said, poor man's ""Departed,"" watch that or Godfather 2 instead."
1,This could have been great,"Righteous Kill could have been awesome with DeNiro and Pacino. It wasn't. The two superstars didn't have a great chemistry, and even worse, didn't have a great writer. The plot just didn't grip me and I couldn't summon any caring for the characters. I reserve one star ratings for movies I can't even finish, and this was one of them."
2,Put me to sleep,"Pacino - Deniro, sounds like a perfect combination. It didnt work, i almost felt they didnt want to work together either. The movie twist and turns this way and that and the outcome is sadly disappointing. I expected so much more from two of Hollywoods biggest guns. Glad i got it used and dint pay full price for it!"
4,Thank You Hollywood,"Thanks to Hollywood for proving the Bible verse in Romans chapter three where it says ""There is none righteous no not one.' The only hero I know for sure about is Jesus Christ who provides ""for"" (because a non-perfect human being cannot make themselves perfect) and delegates ""within"" (because a non-perfect human being cannot make themselves perfect even if they tried)"
2,Not Urban nor is it Bellydance,The title is false. There is nothing Urban about this dvd except for MAYBE the clothes. And it definately is NOT a belly dance video.Two stars for a workout dvd.
2,just okay,"I really like the dry vac part of the Flip It. I have a lot of hardwood flooring and the wet ""mopping"" function doesn't seem to be built to handle a lot of space. It is not easy to push, so it takes a lot of physical energy to get the job done, particularly since the mop head is so small which means lots of going back and forth. Also the cord is short so there is a lot of stopping to find a new outlet. But what did I expect for this price? The other problem is that I have been unable to find a local store that carries that wood floor cleaner although I see it can be bought through Amazon. I'd opt for an upgraded version of the Flip It, if there is one."
3,Works for Price.,"I got this product because i have multi surfaces to clean slate, hardwood and tile. with A new baby in the house i needed something that would really clean and be quick but not too expensive this answered that calling. The steam mop feature work great for all my surfaces. i really feel confident that the floor is clean.cons: The vacume feature barely works i still feel like i need to sweep first on all the surfaces. The tank is not very big so i have to refill and empty them several times to do all the floors. the tank kind of fights to go back in after cleaning it."
2,"Bissell Flip - it Bare Floor Cleaner, 5200","This product did a better job on my floor then the mops I was using. I was having trouble getting my floors clean and leaving a shin due to the salt that was being dragged in from outside. What I did not like about it was that it is harder to use. I am in my 60's and it did wear me out after doing the large floor, plus I had to be very careful about how I did it so it would's leave steaks. Which a lot of the times it did."
4,Floor cleaning,The Bissell Flip-It saves me a lot of time cleaning floors and does a more thorough job than a mop.
4,The Best Christmas Present Ever!,"I was very leery of purchasing this product based on the reviews I read here....Thankfully, I decided to ask for it from my Husband for Christmas anyway! It is the best thing to have! I have not had to get down on my knees to scrub floors for almost three months now...It cleans up very easily and stores right in my closet. It might have a few little drawbacks, but nothing worth mentioning and nothing worth deciding to not buy it."
1,This machine is terrible!!!!!!,"The only thing I asked for Christmas was for the Bissell Flip It. We searched all over town and I finally found it at Best Buy for $93.99. I was so excited to get it home and try it out. Unfortunately, the thing leaked fluid all over my floor and it blew the dirt away from the machine instead of vacuuming it up. I was so disappointed, I had my husband return it to the store the next day! Needless to say I was without present on Christmas."
2,What a disappointment!!!,"I was so excited to finally get the bucks to buy one of these gadjets. I run a daycare so mopping daily is a necessity! I thought this was an answered prayer. I should've went with Mom's advice and purchased the Hoover!!!Having already owned a Bissell vaccuum, and being extremely happy with that particular purchase, I thought I was making a wise decision in choosing the Bissell FlipIt over the Hoover Floor Mate. What a let down! It does clean well, if you want to take the whole day cleaning the floor! I could mop the old fashioned way much faster. I was so sure I was doing something wrong that I called the 800# to speak with a rep. After I answered his many questions - I finally asked him one. Is it SUPPOSED to work this way?, I asked. ""There will be some resistance"" was the reply. That's all I needed to know, I said.This baby's going back!"
2,save your money and sanity!!,I have to say I was excited to buy this vaccuum. The idea of vaccuuming and mopping in one unit made me thrilled. I have twin toddlers who are 2 1/2 years old - so convenience is HUGE to me!! I was pretty dissapointed with the dry vaccuum did not pick up well at all - so what is the point???? Now I still have to use the broom before I mop. ALso the fluid goes very quickly. I am in search of another unit! Save your money and mostly aggravation!
1,Bissell flip it-flipped it back to the store,Tried this product only twice and returned it for Hoover H3010 plus spinscrub. Bissell was difficult to use. Had to repeatedly go over same area with cleaner and would dry up to soon to effectively clean some spots. Had hard time pushing and pulling to squeegie dry floor. Have a bad back and neck. Was really aggravated with performance. Maintenance was easy. Tried the Hoover and like it better.
5,FANTASTIC PRODUCT,I love this product. The one thing that I would advie everyone to do is FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. You should absolutely empty the cansiters after each use to preent a foul odor. This is not hard to do and only takes a couple of seconds.This machine was excellent at sucking up the water and leaves my floors beautifully shined. It's so lightweight and compact that I can use it daily for spot cleans if necessary. I love how it rotates from vacuum to mop in one twist. It's great!This is definitely a product for the home. I would not recommend it for industrial use. Someone wrote that they tried to use the machine to vacuum leaves....not a good idea.
2,waste of money,"I was so excited to buy this because my whole house is hard wood floor. Waste of money!, I have 2 cats and all it does is blow the air around. If you have pets its a waste of money. The mop side works just ok, it would be better to just buy a vacume for hard wood floor."
1,Doesn't make life easier.....,"The Bissell Flip It is completely useless..... I was excited to use it and clean my laminate floors after the holiday mess.... What a Waste of Time and $$$$It just blew the dust bunnies and crumbs around and under furniture. The removable compartment doesn't fit well and the air actually blows out of there instead of moving down to the suction part. It must be some sort of defect. Then the wet part, the genius part of this machine is supposed to be that it cleans and dries the floor with the back and forth motion. Yes, it does that, until you have to go forward again and leaves a wet trail over the dry section! Plus it leaves wet lines after you use it a while!It is going back tomorrow!!!! I rather use swifter!!"
1,Waste of MONEY and TIME~!!!!!!!,"I have hard floor throughout the entire house both ceramic tile and Laminate wood. I got rid of carpet because it is filthier. I also have two dogs that bring dirt in and out between slight shedding. I have learned about this Unit, and gave it a try. Well, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. First of all, the unit is too small. You have to go back'n force over and over between trash bag, refilling to machine between cleaning which gets old fast. Then, it does not clean as good. For 12 x 12 Ceramic tile, you would have to go over and over the area before you can move on. I found it MUCH easier and LESS expensive to just sweep or vacuum with a regular vacuum machine, and then use mop to clean the floor. It gives BETTER result in no time~!! DO not wast your time and money into cheap GADGET like this one, or Floor Mate, the worse. Do not get the lazy idea, just do it physically can actually save you a lot of trouble. I am taking it back."
1,DON'T BUY IT! JUNK ALERT!,"I have never thought that Bissell made a quality product so I'm not sure what lured me to purchase this lemon. I guess because it was on sale at Target and I had just moved into a house with white, brick flooring. (1st mistake! :)This is a terrible product. It doesn't work. Period. There is nothing good to say about it. A mop and a bucket does a better job and is faster."
3,Not too shabby,"Like other reviews the vaccume side not so great. I did love the mop side, really easy to use and I thought a good size. If it was any bigger you would get out the giant carpet cleaner. This one was easy and fun enought for my 6 year old to use. For the price I think it is great but Bisell should have just made it have the mop part only in my opinion."
2,Smoking! (Literally!),"I have had this product for about a year but don't use it all that often because the vacuum side isn't all that good and for the small floor area that I have, I usually find it quicker to just use a dust mop and then mop. However, I drag it out every so often and tonite, immediately after I plugged it in, the motor made a funny sound and then started smoking - enough to set my smoke detector off. I emptied the detergent area, wrapped up the cord, and put it in the trash bin outside. I don't believe that I will be buy anything like this again."
3,"""Just Ok""","We have all hard wood floors in our house and we have a dog so we are always vacumning. The first time we used the flip-it, it clogged and we had to clean the filter. It's just okay, I'm not really satisfied. The one thing I do like about it though is for washing the floors. That works well."
2,I'm returning it.,"I was very unhappy with this product. The suction for the dry vacuum was very weak. The air blowing out the side of the vacuum actually blew the dirt away before I could vacuum it up. The wet vac left streaks and did not dry the floor. The cord got in the way while using it. It is actually less time consuming using my regular vacuum and then mopping. Although it is a small vacuum, it was bulky and difficult to use."
1,Very Disappointing product!,"I was very excited to get this product but I have returned it because it doesn't do the job. On the tv commercial it shows a woman effortlessly swiffing it around the floor, but in reality it is really hard to push when it is washing. My shoulder ached after doing one small room, it would have been easier with swiffer mop. I think they have used false advertising for this product."
2,"too heavy, hopefully newer ones are better...",I bought this one about a year ago...wish I had waited. I hate doing the floors and have numerous products it hopes of making that job easier. It's too heavy.
2,returned it received refund no problem,I returned it because there was no heater on it...and would nt have kept it because the cleaning surface is way too small
1,Bissell Flip It,Streaks and very uneven cleaning. Cannot get uniform wetting. I am very disappointed and have gone back to using a mop.
5,Really gets the dirt!,"I am amazed how much dirt this small mop picks up. I have had it for a year and it really cleans the floor. I have had no leaking or failure to pick up the water, or any flaws in a year. It's so much easier to use than a regular mop and bucket, I highly recommend it!"
1,Bye-bye Bissell,"When I first saw the commercial for this, I wanted it! So I started searching around for one. Found it on Amazon and the reviews were ""iffy"". I always use the reviews but I also keep an open mind on items. So I got it two days ago. The setup was easy. With my open mind I started to dry vacuum the kitchen and bathroom floors (we have one dog and two cats). Sad to say that I'm returning this item, the suction is terrible. Thought I had something wrong when I put it together so had my hubby check it out. Nothing wrong - it just won't work. Tried it again the next day thinking I was having a bad day. Nada. So I'm not even going to try the wet part and just return it. Geez, usally Bissell puts out awesome products. We hardly return items and never to Amazon. One star for the concept."
3,Bissell Flip-It Bare Floor Cleaner,"I like this machine, although its not very heavy duty and you have to do a lot of physical scrubbing with the machine itself to get the floor clean. I do like not having to lug a mop bucket around and then find a place to empty it, after cleaning the floors with either the brush attachment or the easy clean soft head, you just empty the dirty water and you are done. I also love the fact that you can take the head off and wash and reuse. It's great!!! I'd say a good buy for the money, don't do much with the vacuum side, Im not really sure the purpose for that, but I don't want to suck up stuff in the same side as my cleaning fluid. Does great for small jobs, but not recommended for large amount of flooring."
5,it works,"It's worth owning, a breeze to use, does an excellent job of cleaning my ceramic tile floors. The negative feedback on the vacuum has been corrected by Bissell. I called their customer service line before purchasing and was advised of the correction. Do not hesitate to try this 2 in 1 product. It really does work. Mesa, Az"
2,"Flip it...skip it, save your money","I thought by purchasing a Bissel brand Flip It that the quality would be superior. It was far from superior. Using this machine is more work than standard mopping is! Everything it sucks up gets clogged in the filter, and then you have to go in manually and clean it out (gross!!!). Then, if the pad underneath or the brush gets clogged with stuff, it leaves dirty water spots ALL over your floor. you would be better off with a standard mop."
1,It Really Doesn't Work....,"I bought this for my mother for Christmas. I had read some reviews, but didn't think it could be as bad as they said. It was. The dry vac side blew the dirt away, and then stopped completely. The wet side just kept leaking solution everywhere, even when on the dry side. It didn't dry the floor afterwards, either. The only decent thing I found was that the wet side worked alright. I returned it for a full refund, and would not recomend anyone to get it. Hope this review helped."
1,"Yeah, I'll Flip It Alright -- Right into the Garbage","I truly wish I had read all the previous reviews before buying the Bissell 5200 Flip-It. Now that I've read a few of the other reviews, I say DITTO. It will not pick up even the smallest particle on the dry vacuum side and I had to go over spots on the floor many times before they were clean. I bought it on sale at Target and stupidly threw away the box. I tried it once and just assumed I wasn't pleased with it because I had to first assemble it (which is very easy) and read the instructions and then use it. I figured my dislike came from the amount of time it took from beginning to end. When I used it the second time, the vacuum picked up absolutely nothing. It falls over easily, and the water stinks terribly. Give me back my old string mop."
3,Okay for light cleaning,"I have 4 big dogs who like to run in and out and track all over my tile floor. The first time I used the Flip-it, there was a lot of hair and debris on the floor from the holidays and the vacuum side just wasn't up to the task. The vacuum blew the hair away, then it wouldn't pick up most of the dirt. So I used my canister vac instead.Afterwards, the wet side did much better but I couldn't get enough solution on the floor. There were plenty of streaks plus it doesn't do a good job getting to the grout lines.Overall it's okay for light vacuuming and spot cleaning but not if your floors are moderately dirty."
1,deserves zero stars,"Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product. The vacuum is absolutely useless, all it does is blow the dirt all over the place and the filter needs to be cleaned every 15 minutes or so. This is possibly the only vacuum that leaves a room dirtier after vacuuming than before you started. The tanks for washing floors are much too small and need to be changed constantly. I am unable to return this dud since it has been used. Buy yourself a dustpan, broom, bucket and some cleaning rags and you will be better off than being stuck with this lemon."
2,This thing doesn't suck!,"The one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn't! This thing blows more air than it sucks dirt. What a useless thing. I'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor. This thing certainly doesn't do it! If you're looking to buy this thing, look again -- there MUST be something better if not just your regular broom!"
1,flip it vacuum,"The flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did I know thatI would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop. When using the wet mop-it will leave water lines where I stop, therefore I have to wipe up the floor with paper towels. When using the vacuum myliquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks!I have not recommended this product to anyone. A waste of $100.00!"
2,dont waste your money!!,I bought this to replace my Swiffer vac thinking it wld be easier to use. Its not even close!! You cannot use the wet vac unless u dump the cup first and it does not pick up hair well at all!! The filter clogs and makes a huge mess and it doesnt work if yr floor is the least bit uneaven. Really go get yourself a Swiffer!!
3,It works for lightly dirty floors,"I bought this to mop my wood floors. It works but it isn't as nice as I was hoping. Most of the cleaning solution ends up being soaked up by the cleaning pad and doesn't get sucked up by the vacuum. It's not that it leaves the floors dirty but it makes me think that I'm just moving a dirty wet cleaning pad around the floor. It doesn't work well on heavy dirt but it is suitable for light dirt and regular use, just don't think that you're going to avoid ever having to pull out the old mop for the heavy dirt."
2,Flip it vac.,"I am a senior and have used many different vacuum cleaners in my life, this one has not my full approval, and it also leaks. I click slightly for the water but even then, at the end, it leaks and keeps leaking for a few minutes, leaving a puddle on the floor. Sorry, but I did not like the product what so ever."
2,So crappy I gave it away for free within weeks,"This product leaks, does not clean well, etc. I have nothing good to say about it."
1,this sucks.... err doesn't suck,this vacuum can't pick up a cheerio of the tile floor. I'm NOT talking about one that's stuck to the floor either. In fact it doesn't pick up much of anything. The flip it - is a joke - not like youi can just switch back and for. you have to change parts. It doesn't even seem to want to pick the water back up very well when using the wet side. Basically useless except as a big ole paperwait. Personally I don't have a desk that big! Serious waste of money. Hope to exchange it.
1,Bissell 5200 Flip-It Bare Floor Cleaner,"I purchased this cleaner because I am getting old and washing my whole downstairs on my knees has been killing me. I have tile in every room. Hate mops. Well, I did realize you'd have to change the water a lot but the machine didn't work well all the time. Sometimes water did not come out and I had to keep going back and forth to get the flow going. Everything was in place so I don't know what it was. And I vacuum my floors first with my Kenmore. Anyway, I used it maybe 3 weeks then sold it to my neighbor for the same amount of money it cost me, so I wasn't too disappointed. I think it is good for hardwood floors, linoleum or even laminate, but not so much tile like I have. By the way, my neighbor loves it. She says the vacuum works great."
3,Bissell,"My client just bought this Bissell yesterday for me to use on her floor. I think you would do better in high traffic areas if the brush would spin, was not good as i thought it would do. Took it longer to clean and a mop would be quicker. Refilled 3 times too. Very time comsuming if you have a big area to do. I would check out Hoover before buying this one."
1,Buy a Mop and a Broom,"I bought this to make my life, helping around the house, easier. This didn't even come close. I have mopped a lot of floors in my life and this product made more work for me. The vacuum, wet and dry, has as much suction as a gold fish! If you want to sweep first and use this contraption to 'mop' the floor, just prepare yourself to then wipe up the muck that it just pushes around. A note to Bissell, Not even close! The good reviews for this thing are most likely employees of Bissell or from people that actually clean the floor before cleaning the floor. Either way, I'm getting my money back and using it to go the way of a regular mop and broom."
4,Great little cleaner!,"I had used one of these machines about a year ago and wanted one for myself! I love how it vacuums and then flips to mop. Don't really have to vacuum first either. Wish it had a separate vacuum hose to detach and use in corners or under furniture. Otherwise, it's great to mop since it sucks up most of the water and the floor dries much faster."
4,wonderful for all floor types,"this is great for in between cleaning! I'm a hands and knees scrubber, but doing that every week is rather rough. this makes it so I only have to clean that way every other week! it's not as good as hand cleaning, but it does a decent job. and the sweeper function is pretty nice too to clean up crumbs and hairs. the only issue i have is that when you clean out the tank all the crumbs are mixed in with the dirty water and sometimes it takes awhile for the fluid to wet the pad. other than that it's a nice, easy to use cleaning item."
2,flip floor cleaner,I sent this product back as it does not do what it says it will do. The vacumm part of it is not good at all. I just laid 400 square feet of tile and it just dosen't do what it is suppose to do.
2,Returned it,"It's a good idea, but just wasn't worth the $100 I spent on it. I agree with the previous reviewers that the vacuume side actually blew dirt away before it swept it up and the mop side didn't have the power. The one time I used it I couldn't get up a coffe spill along my cabinets. I might have kept it for quick clean-ups if it hadn't been so expensive."
4,Excellent Product !!!,This conditioner is really good. I am using this product for the last couple of months. I would certainly recommend this conditioner to anyone who reads my review...
1,(older edition?) Too Fragmented for my taste...,"I found this book to be too much micro-focused.the book could have been improved with a better use of maps, they should have:been on a larger scale, showing the different gauges to highlight lack of interchange ability,the smaller maps should have been better linked to what stage - period of the war the smaller (local) segments fit into.shown the predominent traffic flow (freight & troops) at different times.Althought a RR & transportation specialist, I had trouble following a continuous thread through this book; 'disjointed'.too many details, too little overall view(s)"
5,One of THE BEST Rock recordings ever.,"great poetry, jim at his best. ray at his best with his jazzy organ sounds, robby and his bottleneck guitar sound great.. and of cource john.. great in L.A. woman.. i am a drummer.. i could never do that!"
5,"The Best, Most Consistent of all the Doors Albums","Although there are some stand out tracks on other albums, LA Woman is the most pleasing album overall that the Doors produced and one which exudes quality on all the tracks. It is the most blues oriented of all the albums, whilst still maintaining the "" other worldly"" mystic tone that was the Doors trademark on tracks like L'America, Hyacinth House, and the WASP.The production mix showcases equally the musicianship of the Doors as well as the strong vocal talents of Morrison. The instrumentation is more complex than in other albums, less pop oriented than other Doors albums - the Doors were coming out of their musical adolescence with this one. If you own one Doors album it has to be LA Woman."
4,Ve'y good.,"This is quite my favourite Doors album. The title track is amazing, and The Wasp just sends shivers down your spine. And don't forget The Changeling and L'america. A good place to start, as far as Doors material goes."
5,It's The Doors!!! 'Nuff said.,"The thought of the Doors making a bad album is hilariously ludicrous. I would rate none of their albums less than 5 stars, but L.A. Woman happens to be one of my favorites. Most of the cuts on this album are full-fledged blues, which The Doors dabbled with on Morrison Hotel, then perfected on L.A. Woman. If you are a Doors fan, you must own this album."
5,LA Woman (DVD-Audio),"Not as splashy as ELP's Brain Salad Surgery DVD Audio but still a quantum leap over any CD version I've ever heard (including the new remasters). There is no audible hiss; the guitars and drums are crystal clear. The Lizard King sounds like he''s in your room. My only gripe is the underutilization of the subwoofer channel. However, this is a must buy."
5,The best Doors album and my favorite album,"This is the best doors album and my absolute favorite by them and any other band for that matter. The reason jim sounds (wrongly) tired and bored is that this a blues album, plus with jail time hanging over his head I don't know about you but the fact he put all the emotion he had with little voice he had left to me out distances anything the doors or any other band has done since. The lyrics are awesome, if sad for such a radiant singer who had now burned out from rock stardom. The true fan sees this as a return to their roots of blues and jazz improv and poetry that was the best of Morrison's career. W/ that said I can only hope you see beyond Jim's beard and into the soul of this music. This is the Doors masterpiece."
3,DVD Audio,"I am perplexed. We have all heard this album. This is the DVD-Audio version of it. Why is no one reviewing that? How is the mixing, the sound quality, the speaker distribution?"
4,This is the end it was only for Jim Morrison & The Doors!,"The sixth and final last CD album for the essential lizard king's only moment. A few songs for retrospective of Jim Morrison is these songs like ""Love Her Madly"", ""Riders On The Storm"" and ""L.A. Woman"". It's the only highlights I've got on my Best of collection here!"
4,"Well done ""Lizard king""","Ther's only one Doorsalbum that can outgrade this one and that's the first one, simply called ""the Doors"". This album contains songs like ""Riders On The Storm"" (my favourite) and ""Don't You Love Her Madly"". To the sound, it's identical to the the first one. This was made just before Jim flipped out, which resulted in the weakly made ""Soft Parade"". Why isn't it worth 5 stars? well the songarrangement quality is a bit muddle. Otherwise than that, a great buy."
4,Not sure ???,"Top album by a top band.With that said,I bought this and really dont listen to it.Instead, I listen to my box set remastered edition. The extras just werent worth it to me, but who am I..........support your favorite artists."
2,DVD-Audio,"I have to say that I am a little disappointed with this disc. L.A. Woman is perhaps the best of the Doors albums but the DVD-Audio is not very well done. After being totally blown away by other DVD-A discs ( The Eagles Hotel California, America Homecoming to name a couple) this one is kind of a dud. The surround is very artificial sounding or even nonexistant in places.There is no real advantage to owning the DVD-A disc over the cd."
5,doors,"I've always enjoyed the lizard king...and his bandmates.Unfortunately I was too young for the show in new haven, ct in 67'. This cd is incedible. I lovvvvve the alternate versions. JDM left this world way too young.""I live uptown...I live downtown....I live all around.""So many years later, and yes the bandleader does....still..Thanks for your time ....Jikan"
1,Remixed!!!,"Yes, the sound is great but the tracks are remixed, often with new vocal and instrumental parts. These are NOT the original mixes! Caveat emptor!"
5,Doors still rock after 40!,Excellent re-mastering of a classic! Second CD features uncut studio sessions. I love it! No one does it like The Doors and no one will ever repeat their sound.
5,One for the collection,This album is certainly one of the many great Doors albums and a must have for the serious collector.My all time favorite is Strange Days followed by Morrison Hotel but this is equally as great.
3,Not the best Doors album,"I understand that since this is the last Doors album, many consider it their best. But several tracks here are pedestrian. Morrison's vocals reflect his physical decline due to booze and drugs. Though the keyboards and guitar are often impressive, the songs here are quite uneven. The standard blues numbers are just that -- standard, in no way exceptional. Morrison's poetic excursions in L'America and The Wasp are far from his best. L.A. Woman, except for the tiresome ""mojo risin"" interlude, is an impressive song with striking lyrics. Love Her madly is a pleasant listen and Riders on the Storm is a fine song. But add it up and it's not a consistently fine album.Strange Days remains the Doors' apex, with a multitude of haunting songs that recur in my mind decades later. Their first album and Morrison Hotel also rank among their best. It's hard to beat the rock and roll desperation of Roadhouse Blues."
3,SO SO,Although the DVD-Audio is better than the equivalent CD the difference is not great.Some surround implementation is ok and helps but subjective audio quality as hi res disc is simply not there.For Doors fans the DVD-A is probably worth it but for anyone interested in improved audio through the hi resolution format this does not compare with the better examples out there.
5,Awesome,If you like the Doors this is the CD for you. You can't beat Jim Morrison in the capacity he was born to play: the blues.
5,"Thanks, Jim!","Jim Morrsion died while this album was climbing the charts. I can't listen to ""L.A. Woman"" without mixed feelings of joy and sadness. Joy- because the music, lyrics, and vocals are so fantastic. Sadness- because this is the last Doors studio album.If Jim had to go, at least he went out on a high note. Although Jim, at this time, may or may not show up for a session, what the Doors were able to get on tape was well worth any inconvenience.For the ""L.A. Woman"" sessions, the band basically went back to the woodshed, literally. They recorded this masterpiece in their rehearsal studio. The tracks are essenitally ""live"" recordings with very little overdubbing. Morrison even used a hand-held mic. The intimacy of this approach adds much to the sound and feeling of the album.""L.A. Woman"" ended up being Jim's ""good-bye"" letter to his fans."
4,Last true Doors record,"The Doors last stand. A bit of a departure from the earlier recordings. This was Jim's last recording before his death. A very bluesy effort with a laid back sound throughout. Songs like the Changeling, Love her madly and others are more real and not contrived just for the sake of doing a different record. Jim sounds like a blues shamen on this one. Too bad they never got to build from this one. Riders on the Storm rejoice and pick this one up."
1,LP STILL THE BEST SOUNDING FORMAT,I was disapointed in the mix of the entire DVD Audio disk. Who ever did it should of call the engineers who worked on ELP'S Brain Sallad Surgery. The mix is flat and Jims vocals need more than just the center channel speaker. I also feel the sub channel was left out in the remix of this great recording. If you want to hear great L.A. Woman recording BUY A TURN TABLE AND THE LP VERSION OF L.A. WOMAN.
3,Attempting the dignified exit,3 1/2Although The Doors final entry had a few songs that could hang with the best of their catalog (obviously the ones that went on to be hits) those songs almost feel like intuitive last-chance stabs at audio immortality in an attempt to raise the vibe of these creatively limited final recording sessions.
3,A LITTLE OVER-RATED,"Ok, I know the word ""over-rated"" appears on just about every amazon review page......but that word really does describe this album. Some of the songs on this just suck sh*t. Like ""Cars Hiss by my Window"".....very slow paced. ""LaMerica"".....kindof crazy, whacked out garbage. And then that song after LaMerica, ""Hyantich House"" is a real bomb. I'd say go with ""Best of the Doors"", since that album has the good hits on this one (LA Woman, Riders On the Storm, and Love Her Madly), plus many other good songs, yet without some of the crappy songs on the LA Woman album."
2,Who ReMixed This Mess?,"All of these tracks are very, very familiar from three decades of airplay and the LP. The net effect of the mix is as if the surviving band mates said, ""Let's push all Jim's vocals down, and fight over the surround joystick so we each get our share of the channels"". On most tracks, the band seems curiously crowded in the front, and then suddenly an instrument will blare out the back channels. Jim's voice was mixed low in volume and low in pitch so he is no longer fronting the band, he's singing by himself alone in the center channel. This remix is worse even than the DVD-A of Yes, Close To The Edge, which is an all-time bungle. Ham-handed remixes of well-known material like this are killing DVD-Audio."
5,Answers Many Important Questions,"I know God is merciful, but never understood why the murderer who repents the day he dies gets to go to heaven as well as a lifetime loyal believer. The difference is the rewards received in heaven! Now it all makes more sense!"
1,From an athlete's point of view (on the track).,"Further Clarification from an athlete's point of view: It was written in the review that ""The Bible mentions MANY times about our ""rewards"". But as Christian, we need to look beyond that, as God intends for all of us to set our (mature) spirit on the race."" I LOVE running a race. I have NEVER met an Olympic runner (a mature athlete) who focuses on the reward in a 100 meter dead heat. At the professional level, it is not even conceived. It is ""written"" in numerous places and well known among athletes and spectators that there is a prize (a promised reward) at the end, but no one focuses on it. NO ONE. As the 100 meter last ""less than"" 9.90 seconds, so do our lives by God's eternal clock. Focus on the race."
1,Salvation by works of the law is failure to know God.,"I have noticed that these books all follow the same premise -'working for your salvation'. Yes the Bible does say ""work out your salvation..."" but 'work out' is different from 'work for'. One implies 'a process of learning' the other 'work hard or else you're going to be rejected'. What is it about Christians that they are not happy unless they are beating themselves up over some failure to please God? So they do 'more work' to try and be accepted all the while not realizing they are striving 'under works of the law' instead of 'resting in grace'."
1,Please remove my review of this book...,"To the editorial staff, I wrote the following review:C.S. Lewis' needed to get a reality check., March 13, 2003Reviewer: Holden from MassachusettsNo one is arguing whether it's ok to accept God's rewards. That's a moot point. C.S. Lewis'needed to get a reality check...Please remove my review of this book as I feel there are a fewreaders who have misunderstood my critique. Thank you."
5,Holy Smokes!,"WOW!!! I feel that Bruce Wilkinson has really hit the nail on the head. I remember being taught about the Christians in Rome who persevered in their faith, despite harsh persecution, for the rewards they would receive for their faithfulness. It wasn't the rewards here! As a matter-of-fact, the crowds were stunned as Christian yelled to be thrown to the Lions. They wanted their reward, now! Wilkinson has written a tidy little book that ties all the strings together."
3,"Okay, Prayer of Jabez and Secrets of the Vine Are Better","While ""A Life That God Rewards"" contains some good insights, I liked ""Prayer of Jabez"" and ""Secrets of the Vine"" better.Among Wilkinson's more insightful comments include:1) page 74 - ""Ruling in heaven will have nothing in common withe corruption and manipulation we're so used to seeing in displays of power on earth!"" (to that I can say ""amen"" because I'm so sick and tired of seeing flesh on parade both in the world and in the church!).2) page 85 - ""Do you want to store up treasures in the heavens that does not fail? Then surrender it to God's priorities here. That is the only way. (again, amen! we must adjust our priorities and lives around God and let Him have the power to do what He wants to do in and through us).While the two comments above encouraged me, there seemed to be more like comments in the other two books.All in all, a good read that lacks the substance of the first two books in the series."
2,Life based on works?,"I found this book difficult to be enthusiastic about. It is definitely the most controversial of Wilkinson's books so far. Wilkinson maintains that in order to be rewarded in Heaven we must have good works. It seems like he is saying that we must have rewards in Heaven in order to be satisfied. This is off the mark. We should be striving for God's will and do as He would have us to, but not only to get rewards. The books reasonings seem selfish. There is little information about faith. I expected much better."
5,Highly recommended,This presents a nice overview of Rick's career. If I had the money I would buy the Bear Family box sets (at least the first which highlights his early years). But this provides a decent sampling of his best. One can see the quality fall off on the last disc but what a ride this set provides.
5,Rick(y) Nelson......ADULT IDOL,"What an absolute joy to listen to some different versions of Rick(y) Nelson songs, as well as the original versions. My personal favorite in this collection is a Buddy Holly song that Rick sang so well.....TRUE LOVE WAYS. The 4 disc box set(100 songs) was worth purchasing to me for that song alone!"
4,Monsarrat at Sea,"Although most of what is in this book is already well known to me as a student of his work, there is one passage of especial interest which I was able to compare with the same passage in his autobiography. There has been a change in that passage which is of interest to me. I also compared it to another recent purchase ""The Cruel Sea Retold"" and I am disappointed not to have had reply from the author of that book.Marjorie Lockwood"
4,Entertaining Listen,"Product exceeds my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product. I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase. Great on trips !"
5,Krentz fans will love!,"I was wary of switching from reading Jayne Ann Krentz novels to any of her psudonyms because I knew they would be different tones and/or voices, but I'm so glad I did. Second sight was the second Amanada Quick novel I've read (The River Knows was the first one), and now I'm hooked. Her writings of the Polite World and its inhabitants are just as good as those set in more modern times. It's a good thing too since I've read all the ones by Krentz published as herself. I now have a whole new set of books to read!"
1,This one's a stinker,"I really love Amanda Quick, but this one just didn't work. We don't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together; the action starts after they've already spent a week getting to know each other. Very disappointing from a romance novel.And I don't really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels, but the plot in this one defies belief. It's never explained why the first murder even occurs. The hero's fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because she's using the last name ""Jones"" is beyond ludicrous. If that was going to be a major plot point, at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together. But JONES?!All would be forgiven if the romance were compelling, but it wasn't in the slightest. I will probably choose to wait for the next one in paperback or at the library."
3,Just OK,3 out of 5 stars. Another book I started out really liking and then grew bored with. It was ok I guess.
3,"Good, but not riveting","I've read a few books from the Arcane and Harmony Series, but had never read them in order, so I was looking forward to reading the book that started it all. I was a little disappointed with ""Second Sight"". It didn't seem like it was quite up to Ms. Krentz's usual riveting standard. The writing seemed almost a little sloppy at times, not as well constructed as later novels in this series.That being said, though, I did enjoy the book and was happy to start at the beginning of the Arcane novels. I'm also happy that I purchased it, simply because I like to have complete series in my library. I suspect that any sloppiness of writing was simply the author feeling her way through the new universe she had created."
2,Disappointed,"I'm so disappointed. I always look forward to an Amanda Quick book, although the last several haven't been her best.I can't believe this book was written by Jayne Ann Krentz! The characters were flat and had no life in them. There was nothing to show why the hero and heroine loved each other. The villan was boring and unrealized and the storyline uninteresting. I finished the book hoping for improvements but they never appeared.Sadly, I felt nothing for Gabriel and Venetia. Based on the first chapter I thought I was going to like Venetia but it turned out otherwise. Once she went to London she became hard and a bit unfeeling. I couldn't believe her reaction to Gabriel being alive and not dead - it was as though the woman in the first chapter had vanished and been replaced by this unfeeling person. Her attitude was that he should go away and let her focus on her business. She often unknowingly relayed that disinterested feeling to others. Again, a big disappointment."
1,Read her earlier works instead...,"I was surprised by all the positive reviews of this book; it averaged one star with my book club. This is the 2nd Amanda Quick book I have read (the first being ""With this Ring"") and there is no comparison between the two. I really enjoyed her first book, but with ""Second Sight"", it felt like reading a different author entirely. The characters were bland, the dialogue repetitive, and there was no sexual tension whatsoever. This is light reading with a capital L. I'm going to try another of her older books, I hope it isn't as boring as this one."
4,Great mystery,"I found this surprisingly good. I'm not much of a romance reader unless it is mixed with another genre, but I really liked this one. The characters were smart, funny, and endearing. The setting is historical with a touch of fantasy. The characters have some form of magical ability which they hide from society by being a part of the ""Arcane society."" I thought the minor characters were so funny and sweet. Each was different and unique from each other. I'm looking forward to reading more in this series."
2,Subpar plot,"I've always been a fan of Amanda Quick's witty sense for verbal exchanges and amusing plots, but this is by far one of the worst romances I have ever read. The romance between the couple in unconvincing and unsubstanciated; the plot is silly and nonsensical. Do not read it; you'll be disappointed. Try one of her earlier books, like Mystique, that's a bit more plausible."
4,Another enjoyable read by the Queen.,"I gave it 4 stars but if available, I would give it 4-1/2 stars. Ms. Krentz never disappoints. I enjoyed this book as I have all of her previous books. I love her sense of humor, and the personality quirks she gives her characters as well as the strength and intelligence she gives all of her female characters. I love that I learn something new about the era she is writing about in every book. I anxiously await the second book in this series."
2,Another Romance Novel,"This book will probably rate fairly high on a romance-novel lover's list. There is a heroine with some special ability, a hero, and a mystery. The story is pleasant, if not memorable. It was rather like cotton candy, sweet and light, no particular flavor and soon gone."
2,Blah Blah,I am a great fan of Amanda Quick and this book did not move me at all. I really could not get with the whol aura business. But because I like her books I read it anyway. I would recommend it if you had nothing else to read.
4,"""Second Sight"" is Worthy of a Second Read","I have all of the Amanda Quick novels so of course I bought this one as well. I fact, I have most of the books written by her other authorial names she uses as well. Her romance is as pleasing, enjoyable and complicated as I expected."
1,Yuk Yuk Yuk,Don't waste your time or money on this one. This book is terrible. Whatever happened to Amanda Quick writing great books. She used to be my favorite autor. It will be a long time before I ever purchase another one of her books.
3,Solid romance novel,"Even with the supernatural element, I enjoyed this story. It was quirky and fun, with a hint of mystery and some good characters. It's a traditional romance story, following the prescribed arc, so all of the goodness lies in the little details. Her descriptions, the dialogue, and those little unexpected twists make this a worthwhile read for any romance lover. Not my favorite of her books, but not my least favorite, either. A very middle-of-the-pack 'good' romance novel, a great rainy weekend read!"
3,"Frankly, I'm disappointed...","Since everyone else has given the basic premise of the book, I'll just give my opinion of the book. Frankly, I was disappointed in the book. I am a die hard fan of ""Amanda Quick/Jayne Anne Krentz/ Jayne Castle, but....Yes, I do feel it was worth reading, but not in hardback. This book has interesting characters, an intersesting sub-plot with the Arcane Society going on, but it just felt like a longer book that had been whittled down for publishing purposes. The characters did not have the depth most of her books offer and the plot was a bit lame- just didn't feel like it was more than a detailed outline."
5,Great Thriller/Romance,"Amanda Quick does not disappoint in her latest installment set in Victorian England. She has the gift of all fine writers -- the ability to create interesting characters, complex plots, and fascinating details (who can resist the Arcane Society?) that leave the reader with the feeling that the time was well spent. The paranormal aspects of this book are particularly intriguing, and the romance aspect was well done.Be prepared to finish this in one sitting, because you won't want to put it down."
4,"Good Book, But Lots of Irrelavent Information","I though this was a very good book about termoil and terrorisim. However, there was a lot of stuff in their just used as fillers."
4,A solid and exciting read.,"A solid and thrilling read. The writing was lean and tough with a hard-boiled edge. The characters had depth, and their dialogue crackled with humor. The scenes built around the terrorist attack in New York -- I won't spoil things by giving away any more about it -- were especially powerful, largely because one gets the feeling they could happen in the real world. With this first book in what hopefully will be an ongoing series, Mr. Clancy is moving into new territory with assurance."
1,Not worthy of Tom Clancy,The best part about it is that it is short. Shame on Tom Clancy for allowing his name to be put on this worthless novel.
1,A game-based novel?,"There have been many PC games based upon novels, but this is the first (I think) novel based upon a game, and it shows. I do not believe Clancy wrote anything... at least I hope so."
1,Stinks,"This is not a Tom Clancy book, and reading it is a waste of time and money . Surely Tom Clancy can't be this hard up for money to allow his name to be used on such a poorly written book."
1,What a waste of money!,It is a pity that a respected author should stoop to putting his name in big letters on the front cover of a book that was very obvoiusly written (badly) by others. I was left with a real sense of having wasted my money.
2,Icon II ?,"If you have not read this book, try Frederick Forsyth's Icon instead. He did a much better job with the same story line."
2,Not the Best,I bought this book hoping for another Tom Clancy thriller but was disapointed with what I read. The book has a corporation as the good guys (yeah like that could every happen) with their own weapons and equipment. It was not what I expected from an author as talented as Tom Clancy
1,This is poor writing at it's best!,If this was the first book I ever read by Tom Clancy then I probably would never read another one. What a let down. Tom Clancy what were you thinking of to allow your name to be associated with this book (and I use the word book very loosly)?
4,Pretty Good-3 1/2 Stars,"I was generous and rounded up. This is not the best book by Tom Clancy, not by any means. But it is not as bad as the other reviewers say. It has a lot of good ideas in it and it has a couple of good intertwining subplots and good action scenes. Sure the characters weren't the best, and having more development would have been great, but it is what it is, and I thought it was pretty good overall."
3,His best co- writen book by a long shot.,"This book kept me reading, but had its boring spots. Good book but don't read the next powerplays."
4,Clancy's Politika,"I would recommend this book to anyone out there who doesn't currently know a great deal about strategic and corporate warfare in the 21st century. The book is a rather grand book for those who haven't read a Tom Clancy style book before. I say his style as it's not truly his writing, at least the majority of it. The plot of the book is not overly complex while still offering enough complexity for those who have already ventured into the depths of Clancy-ness. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a ""Tom Clancy style"" book."
2,"Readable, but up to Clancy's old caliber?","This book isn't a horrible book, but not what people have come to expect from Clancy. First, the complaints. This book's biggest weakness is it's bad habit of jumping around, and jamming characters in for the entirity of three pages. Obviously, those characters aren't given much opportunity for development, and even some of the major characters seem to be either flat or generic. Also, the plotline,while serviceable, has been done before, and better, and there are many mediocre subplots. On to the good point. This book has some very exciting moments, especially during the (Potential spoiler)terrorist attack on New York. The rest of the book, however, tends to be dog slow. All in all, it's an OK book, but not on par with previous Clancy efforts."
1,"This is not political fiction, it's political fantasy.","Super-vigilante Roger Gordian's private army sweeps the world fighting the forces of evil. National frontiers are not a limit for the millionaire's quest. But when his henchmen save a defenseless, unprotected Russian President from a terrorist group, in his own country, this proves to be just too hard to believe. This is the end of Mr. Clancy's cycle as a writer. At least, for this humorless reader."
2,"Well-Written, but sadly lacking in some respects","This book was definitely not written by Clancy. In his earlier series, Op-Center, he at least followed his own style of writing. Without his name on the cover, I could have never guessed he wrote it. The only way it is remotely like any other Clancy books is that it is a definite rip-off of the first Op-Center book. Read them both and look at the similarities: the man who loses his wife (Gregory Donald in Op-Center, the chief of police in Politika), the bombing (a convention in Seoul, New Year's in Times Square). This was not very good, at least not enough to read more than once. It had good points, but overall, he has written much better."
2,Ugh.,"This is bad. Really bad. I could expect this from another author, but Tom Clancy? Sometimes I wonder if he actually writes these series of books (Op-Center and Power Plays.) It came with the CD, so I can't complain, although that wasn't very good either. Tom Clancy seems to get worse and worse.. read some of his earlier books."
1,This is the worst book clancy has written. Its awful,This was written by an inept committee. Tom Clancy should be ashamed to have his name on the cover.
1,Stay Clear,"I'm a committed reader. Once I start reading a book, I finish it. I don't drop it in the middle. No matter how boring a book is, there is sometime a single page or paragraph or sentence which can justify the reading of that book. That holds true for most of the books but, sorry, not this one. I read this book from cover to cover and wondered for a long time how a writer of Calncy's reputation can produce such a book. It triggered an old and recurring thought in my mind; it's everybody's right to make as much money as he or she wishes but should he or she compromise the quality to make that money?"
1,Did he write this?,"I have read almost all of Clancy's books and none have even been as close to a total bomb as this one. I do not think that he wrote this book because some of the parts are not characteristic of a Clancy book. Why in heavens name does a techno-guru have his own private special forces task force? Something like this Clancy would have loked into and realized that that is so ludicrouse an element that he would throw it out immediately. In short, don't buy this book, I would be ashamed to have my name on it, and I hope Clancy is."
3,Starts off well but ends ordinarily,"I read this book in the coming days to the new Milleniun , and wondered whether the same scenario would be enacted somewhere in the world just like mentioneed in New York (or was it Washington ?). That scenario in itself was worth a star, but from then on , the story plodded along as if it were resting on its laurels."
2,Too many mistakes.,"It's not absolutely bad (I put 2 stars!), but boring enough. Advice: if you are writing a book about something (for example, Russia), it's good idea to get acquainted with your subject a little."
1,Don't bother!,"Tom Clancy should be embarassed that he has lent his name to this overt marketing ploy. If he wants to sell on-line gaming, do an ad, don't ""trick"" fans into wasting their time reading a truly deplorable novel (I'm not sure this should even be called a novel). The characters are poorly developed, the plot is poorly laid out, the action is poorly described. In summary,this doesn't even deserve a token scanning. If someone is looking for a story about internal political/ economic/ organzed crime type turmoil in Russia, a better choice would be Forsythe's ""Icon"", or even Thayer's ""A Wild Justice."" Please, if you read this, take my word, and avoid Politika."
1,Why?,"Yep, that's the only question to ask. Mr. Clancy has to stop putting his name on these type of books. The Op-Centre series started off okay but No.4 was by far the worst and if anymore are published I may not buy them. As for Politika, don't bother wasting ink or time at a computer trying a second one. As for potential readers, leave well alone."
1,Script for a Saturday morning cartoon,The only thing this book had to do with Tom Clancy was that his name was on the cover. Score one for the marketing department.
2,Can't be Tom Clancy !!!,"To this point I have ever been a rabid Tom Clancy fan, but this work, if indeed it was penned by Mr. Clancy' falls so far below the standards of excellence set by his previous novels that I find his authorship doubtful. An awful waste of time and paper."
2,Power Plays is power-less,"Although Tom Clancy is highly regarded as a adventure writer, I found ""Power Plays"" limp and unrewarding. The characters jump from one place to another in such disconnected fashion that I found myself not caring for any of them. To me the story was predictable and--dare I say it--boring. There is none of the depth that early Clancy books possess. I had the feeling, like with Michael Crichton's ""Airframe"", that this book was written for one reason: to make money via sequals, cd ROM's, and a movie. This does not make for good writing!"
2,Intriguing Plot. Poor character development,"The first few chapters took some time to get into, but when the opening action plot begins it looks as to be a very promising read. But alas, character development is slow, and many 2nd string characters are barely utilized, and open ended plot threads are dealt with too quickly or not at all towards the end of the book. Too bad Clancy did not write this himself, had a lot of potential."
2,Not A Good Book!,"I bought this book because it had Tom Clancy listed as the author. Surprise. He has hired another ghost writer. The book started out on an exciting note. Boris Yeltsin dies after having heart surgery. The next plot developer is a terrorist act that is committed in New York on New Year's Eve. After the terrorist act it is all downhill. The plot dies a sad death. The villains are even boring. I also was able to discover that Roger Gordian is not Jack Ryan. This is not vintage Clancy. The new book ""Bear and the Dragon"" is a much better book. I think he must have fired his ghostwriter. Don't buy this book."
3,Average - for Clancy that is...,"I'm a great admirer of Clancy's work but this is one of the rare occassions that he has not lived upto my expectations. It is also my first book in the ""Power-Plays"" series. I liked the way he prepared the plot upto the explosion but the story seem to lack ""punch"" after that. Still it is not that bad."
1,shallow and sloppy,"Not only the book is shallow and weak, Clancy's attention to detail is gone too. I can forgive him misspelling of so many Russian words, but a woman named Nikita?! This is a masculine name! Clancy seems to be going from detailed, informative and interesting descriptions to butt-kicking kind of cheap thrillers."
2,Missing key elements of a story,"There were aspects of this book that were entertaining. The action sequences were well written. The overall plot is intriguing. It has the elements that would make a great start to a series of action novels.But it's missing a few things. It's missing a central character. There were several candidates, from the head of the Sword organization, to some of the team leaders for Sword. The police commissioner from New York was also a good candidate. But none of these characters were ever fleshed out enough to be considered the protagonist. The story moved in an orderly fashion, but the conflict that was central to the book was rather bland. There were no surprises and it was generally very predictable.In addition, the language and adult content simply detract more from the book. This has the potential to be a good series, but after reading the first novel, I'm not hopeful."
2,Not up to usual standards,Very dull. Was unable to connect with any of the characters in this story. Did not find the plot to be very creative.
2,Dover Thrift Editions made a poor choice,"I have been an admirer of Gertrude Stein's work and chose ""Three Lives"" in good faith. I wound up discarding the book because of the content of the second story in it, entitled: ""Melanctha"". The story concerns a woman of African descent. The language and content of the story is racist, blatantly so. Why did the publisher choose THIS volume for its Dover Thrift Edition when something far better could have been selected from Gertrude Stein's vast body of work? (And why did Gertrude Stein write something like this at all?)"
5,Fat Burning Workout for Dummies,"This exercise routine is fun, easy, and helps you burn calories. I enjoy working out with this video."
3,Pretty good tape,"This tape is geared towards fitness DUMMIES they teach you everything in explicit detail during your warm up. Than u put those moves together in different ""combos"" for your aerobic workout. The instruction is clear and right on the money every time. You can make this tape easier or harder depending on how hard you wanna work. most moves have modifications to make them hi or low impact."
4,Great Workout!,"I'm just starting to get into an aerobic workout and I found this video to be great. The first 12 minutes gives you all the basics and then the rest of the video goes though combinations of them. Since I am just starting out the whole video seems a bit long, I can't do it all at once, but I find that doing a couple combinations at a time helps give me something to work up to."
4,Easy if you do the intro which shoes the basic moves,"I don't usually do reviews but thought I needed to counter what some other reviewers were saying about her plunging right into 80mph movements with little instruction. There is a section (maybe 12 minutes long) which shows each one of the steps and provides a warm-up at the same time.After that, yes there are a lot of combinations, but believe me: if it's EASY the first time you do it, it will be BORING in short order. So just be patient. Do the beginning section a few times until you know the steps, and then get on with the workout. It *is* easy. It is fun. I like it. And I highly recommend it."
1,Avoid,This product is no better than a poor standard VHS transfer - Grainy & poor sound - Total Disappointment for a great film
5,sweatpea from fla/ny/ca,"Robert was right! A classic blues cd/classic Albert. His usual outstanding guitar licks, and muscular vocals. But there's more. If there has been a flaw in King's body of work, it may be that some of the cuts on occasion ""run together"". This release has extra energy, a delicious flow, and each selection stands on it's own merits as Albert runs the gamut of emotions. Evocative, sweet, powerful, and...catchy? From first to last a buffet of very tasty blues.(Remember when you used to have a limited budget and you scoped out the albums where every/almost every tune was a fave? Bingo!"
3,Video/DVD is Better,"My toddler and I love the Wiggles, and we initially bought this CD before we bought the video. The music is okay, focusing more on teaching children about Australian animals, which is great, but lacks the catchy tunes of the Wiggles in their heyday (e.g., Toot Toot or Yummy Yummy). Listening to the CD without the video is quite frustrating because the songs and dialogue are all about the animals. I had to go out and buy the video for my 2yo so she could see what an emu looks like since she heard about them in the songs! I would recommend the video or DVD before the CD. If you're looking for Wiggles music, try Toot Toot or Yummy Yummy."
5,Mom Of A Wiggles Fan,Good CD to have for long car trips! My 2 1/2 year old son used to hate long car rides but now he does not mind as long as I play The Wiggles CD's. I do get a bit tired of listening to them over and over again but it is either that or listen to a crying little boy which is much harder on the ears. If you liked the music on the DVD then this is the CD for you. It has Steve and his wife talking to the guys on it in between each song giving tid bits of info about the animals.
4,Another Hit,"Our 2-year old just loves this CD and we (his parents) don't find it as mind-numbing as some other Wiggles CD's - even after hearing it over and over again in the car. The songs are pretty catchy and our son seems to enjoy learning about the various animals. We have the video for this too, but he much prefers just to listen to the music and sing along."
3,Just O.K.,"Not the best of Wiggles, video is too fast for little kids to keep up. It is our 19 month old daughter favorite program and she love to dance with the Wiggles and the rest, just not in this video. The bottom line: The Wiggles are great programs for your little one."
2,Echoes of Nature: Rainforest CD,"The only reason I rated this two stars was because my bird could care less about this CD. I originally was online with some bird websites. I have a cockatiel and she is so whiney (squawking - screaming) when you leave the room. One of the reviewers said this CD did the trick for his bird. Well I think I have a special needs bird :) The CD itself is soothing for me. However, it doesn't do anything to quiet my needy cockatiel."
5,CD,"Sounds just like your in the middle of the rainforest , I would deff recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to the forest"
3,A LOT OF RAIN SOUNDS BUT NOT MUCH ELSE,"MAYBE I WAS EXPECTING TO MUCH BECAUSE BESIDES RAINFALL AND VERY FEW BIRD SOUNDS I FOUND THIS CD TO BE VERY BORING,I WAS EXPECTING TO HEAR MORE OF THE DIFFERENT ANIMAL SOUNDS OF THE RAIN FOREST ENVIRONMENT."
3,ecohs of nature--rainforest,"Product was ok .wasn<t what I was looking for ,still ok.service was fast and so was the delivery"
3,Great for kids,"I used this as part of lesson about urban vs. natural sounds. It sounds like what it is! Lots of rain and birds. It's also a good idea to play during naptime, or to induce naptime *ahem*. Very relaxing and fun thing to have on the iPod."
3,Kind of boring.,"Sound quality is good, but was not impressed. Could have been recorded in any backyard during Summer. No real rainforesty sounds. Rain, birds, and frogs. Should be named ""Sounds of Summer"""
3,Lots of frogs,"OK, I like amphibians, and I know they are having a tough time of it, even in the rainforest. So indeed, we DO have to pay attention to them. But not, please, as the featured voice of the rainforest, at least not on a CD. Got this to use as a ""natural alarm clock"" on my CD-radio clock. I've since switched to a different CD that puts morning birds upfront. But, if you are an amphibian fan, or you like to start the day with drippy rain sounds as well as the frogs, go for it!"
5,It am the best jams i ever did herd!,"My man Issac did it again! With his soul jiving jams. I too have 20 albums of his and feel it is da bomb! I sugest if you are a Black Moses fan as I be, you best get this here CD ! Peace -"
1,Is a jewel.,I have this Album in a double vinyl and it is in bad conditions to listening by so much times I play it and here in Spain I can't find it because it's out of catalog. I think that this album is the best of Isaac Hayes and I have around twenty two albums of this man. Thankyou for your attention and service.
4,An eye opening book,"This book takes a very different prospective to the stimulant medications. If your child is diagnosed with ADHD and you are pressed by school and public oppinion to medicate your child, this book will give you strength to resist the medicine.Some of the ideas in the book seems too extreme for me but is general it's a great scientific prospective."
1,Hysterical Garbage,"Contrary to his press release, Breggin is not a mainstream practitioner, but a charlatan exploiting the fears of millions of Americans. His findings have been directly contradicted by the American Medical Association, the National Institutes of Health and the American Psychiatric Association. The book is written in an hysterical style that makes it hard to take seriously and undermines his claims to legitimacy."
4,A great Bob Wills tribute,"""Buddy Emmons Sings Bob Wills"" will satisfy your expectations for what an amazing steel guitar player can do with songs by one of America's greatest songwriters. Buddy's singing makes the listener wonder why he so seldom exercised his vocal talents. I walked into this tribute expecting arrangements that would be heavy on the steel guitar. I was surprised to find conventional versions that give the fiddles, piano, and steel guitar the conventional spacing one would expect to find in an 'Asleep At The Wheel' type arrangement. While not a great steel guitar album, this is a beautiful recording for those who adore Bob Wills' music."
5,"Fun, Happy, Western Swing","Many people know Buddy Emmons' work as the premier pedal steel guitarist in the world but, until this album, few knew what a good singer he is! Here he treats us to one of the most fun, upbeat collections of western swing tunes you could ever want to hear. Each one is a thorough pleasure that will have you grinnin' from ear to ear within the first 8 bars. With such heavy-hitters as Johnny Gimbel on fiddle, how could he go wrong? The music is absolutely top quality and just reeks with ""fun""; it sounds like he's smiling through every tune from start to finish! His numerous CDs of swing standards with Ray Pennington are all very impressive but, I must say, do not have the easy, carefree, swingin' FUN feeling of this album. My extensive collection of Bob Wills albums not withstanding, this one is my favorite western swing album of all."
5,Kickin',"I recently discovered this collection, beautifully played and sung.With a terrific choice of tunes, if you don't know Bob Wills this is the best place to start..........."
4,very interesting.,I was 12 years old when Pope Paul VI and John Paul 1 died so I never really realized what was going on. It's an eye opener.
5,Good Read,"Great conspiracy theory, a good read after reading ""Absolute Monarchs:A history of the Papacy"" by John Julius Norwich and ""A Thief in the night""by John Cornwell. Read them all then make up your own mind."
5,"Anyone who hates jazz, hasn't heard of Spyro Gyra...","Fluid, snap happy, toe-tapping delightful. Fresh and fun. Great house-cleaning music."
1,Beatiful Breast (Fresh out of the implant section),"I thought I would check out othr type movies, and I love Japanese type. This movie was made in 1995. The setting mobster type with an assasin (Black Orkid). This is something you would expect from an old american detective type flick. But it has a good plot.The movie is easy to follow lots of action not much sex only the beganing scene. But it does flow well. Funny dialogs too. I was happy I purchased it,liked the movie and how it was done. You won't go wrong with it."
3,Body Art,"While, the kids had a blast with the product, the crayons were hard to use, the stencils were too flimsy and the paints didn't go on too easily. I don't think I would buy this product again - I would go buy the actual face paint which is what we were looking for in a simpler form."
2,Not so good as the club hits 97 and 2000,"It was a kind of dissapoint, because the club hits are not like that, buy i recommend circuit party 1,2,3,4,and 5 are just great."
5,Stax Holiday,Stax is to soul what Motown was to R&B. This holiday selection will not disappoint. Makes me long for more of that Memphis sound.
3,Self-Absorbed,"The book was touching and beautifully written. While ""Mr. P"" was certainly a man of great intellect, compassion, and literary prowess, it became obvious that this was a couple that was terribly self-absorbed and narcissistic. Reflection can be beneficial, but they carried it to a pathological extreme. Diana was not a ""saint""; none of us is. She was an exceptional woman of talent and sensitivity who was ill. This happens to millions of very fine people on a daily basis. However, in his grief, Lowenstein portrayed her as larger-than-life, saintly, set apart from humanity. A little humility would have humanized the account and made the couple much more endearing to the reader."
2,Very good read.......however,...I thought that the book did not explore Tony's and Lacie's relationship. Too much time was spent on Lacie's family problems and her mixed feelings for Tony's friend. It would have been great if Tony and Lacie had more romantic interaction. Maybe next time Ms. Carter will do better.
2,I hate to agree...but I must,"I must agree with the other reviews that this book was very disappointing. I too waited for its arrival, and I read it in 2 days. I kept anticipating the chemistry between Tony and Lacie to explode, but it never happened. Even when they admitted they had feelings for each other, it left the reader feeling like ""Wait! What just happened?"" This book had so... much potential, but the author missed the mark on this one.If someone doesn't hurry and write a really good IR novel,I guess I will have to dedicate myself to sit down for about a year and write us a juicy IR love story.Still Waiting in GA"
3,"Interesting, But Was a Big Let Down Towards the End","Hi I read Ms. Grayson's book over the weekend and at first I could not put it down, it was very interesting and so good! But towards the end of the book she kind of let me down. It was like her writing style was kind of melting down. I don't know if she just didn't have the same zeal for the book as she did when she first starting writing it, but something happended. She left me hanging also with the romance of Lacie and Tony. I was expecting more to develop between the two of them, but it never happened. According to the book, in my opinion, Joe was the better catch than Tony. He seemed more into Lacie, whereas Tony seemed to be more infactuated with her. It was okay, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,This is supposed to be a romance!!,"One reason that I love romance novels is the pure adrenalin rush that comes from exciting chemistry between the main characters. From the moment the characters meet in this book I waited for the electricity. It was written like the writer was given a four book deal and one of the books had to be an Interracial romance. Lacie Adams is supposed to be a mature woman with an education and life experience. Tony Douglas, her love interest is written like a high school senior. I expect to feel swept away by romance, not dragged through a jerry springer like experience. There was so much time spent on the storylines of other characters, I almost forgot the two main characters were supposed to be involved. I love it when a writer creates a love story that is grand, passionate and does not apologize for being a romance, no matter what the ethnicity of the characters."
2,Not what I expected.,This story was a little disappointing. Although it ended on a good note...the meat of it was a little weak. I can't say I enjoyed this book.
2,real dialog,"The love story the attaction was so lacking I had a hard time beliving that this was a love story or that Lacie was pulled emoional to one man or the other.The secondary charators bulled over the main ones.The story line at work where the main action was at seem like a bothersome part to right. The ending weak and disappointing. There was dialog that made the story pick up and me laught out loud even say ""I know she didn't"" I Was really let down with the story line on Simone.I waited for a final out come and the story just let me down.The failuar to commit to the charator was a real let down."
2,I must agree with the other reviews,"Unfortunately the concensus on this book is correct...the romance was a let down. The story started out well. I got interested in the other characters while I was waiting for the romance to start...While I continued to wait, the book centered around Lacie's family and their dysfunctional behavior. The mother reminded me of a few of my friends mothers (do what I say, not what I do-attitude)...the mother was more likeable than Lacie.Lacie's rational for not getting with Toni wasn't believable. By the time Lacie and Tony got together, I didn't care anymore."
3,Good premise but....,"I like this book, I like the different angle it took regarding the IR romance it is more about a woman's struggle to accept a relationship with a white man rather than the relationship itself hence the triangle aspect between Joe, Lacie and Tony. My only complaint is I think too much is happening in the book, the drama with the mother, sister and the best friends issues. The men also come across as too good to be true, Tony patiently waits for Lacie to accept him, Joe comes to accept too quickly the broken engagement. As for Lacy accepting Joe's proposal cos he is the right colour I suppose there are people who would rather follow society's unspoken rules rather than follow there heart - so that was realistic.All in all not bad for a debut novel perhaps a sequel to see what happens to Joe and to see if Lacy and Tony make it would be interesting."
4,Let's not be hasty...,"I've read the majority of the reviews and I've found that we all have one thing in common. We wanted more romance between the main characters. In truth, the author doesn't give enough time to the romance between Lacie and Tony, nor does she develop Tony's character. Personally, I wanted to know more about Tony and less about Joe. Other than that, it was an interesting and entertaining read and a definite ACCOMPLISHMENT for a first time writer. I hope she writes more novels but gives more attention to character development and situation development."
2,This is not a romance novel :''(,"I was very upset after reading this book. It does not explore the relationship between Tony and Lacie. This novel is a waste of time, excitement, and imagination. Nothing happens that is worth reading. The story carries on FLAT to the ending and the reader is left dissatisfied. I will not read from this author again"
5,Classic!,"This is a classic Julie Andrews romp! Full of great dialog and witty humor! This movie is not to be taken seriously, but great for a Saturday afternoon with the kids! ""RAAASPBERRIES""!"
4,A rediscovered fan of classic musicals,All the cast from Julie Andrews to James Fox offers an nostolgic look at the 1920's through music and song.I just enjoyed the experience and even though the film is over 30 years old it still retains the fun and innocence of the a good musical.Hope others appreciate the musical the many talents of James Fox and Julie Andrews. Especially as there may be few and far between musticals from Julie Andrews in the future.What a treasure this film is. I feel as if there a Millie in all of us.Great movie!!
4,"Thoroughly Modern Millie is ""terrif!""","Thoroughly Modern Millie is a great musical spoof of the roaring twenties. Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, and Carol Channing provide tongue-in-cheek performances that made me laugh until I stopped. The only complaint is that its a wee bit too long, but still great nonetheless. Mrs. Meers, who is Millie (Andrews) and Miss Dorothy's (Moore) house mother is hysterical as the oriental-themed antagonist, with superfluous expressions like, ""Ding foo!,"" and ""Shoo-shong! Shoo Shong!"" I was a bit baffled as to what the writers were on when they thought of the random side plot of Mrs. Meers white slaving young women to Chinatown. Carol Channing is exellent as ever, with her, ""Razzzzberries!!!"" Mary Tyler Moore shows us she sure can dance in that broken old elevator and Julie Andrews is good as always (duh). If you're looking for a light-hearted movie that would rival Leslie Nielson flicks, see this one! Its NOT full of applesauce!"
1,Exchanged for another,I had to return for an exchange. The DVD didn't work. We'll see how the new one is when I get it.
3,Thoroughly Leaden Millie,"Imagine ordering the most succulent. lightest. frothiest souffle imaginable, only to be served something made out of marble. I don't know how it happened: Julie Andrews tries her best to inflate this lead balloon of a movie with her wonderful voice and her native wit, but at the point where Bea Lillie intones that ""they all must die"" trust me, you'll be rooting for her and her dart gun."
3,Cheesy,I bought this movie because my daughters are in the school play. The movie isn't the same as the play. The songs are really good of course because anything Julie Andrews sings is AMAZING but the movie it self was lacking.
3,Thoroughly Modern Millie DVD,"I bought the DVD to replace the VHS my VCR ate. I love this movie, and so will anyone who enjoys a thoroughly silly premise. Millie is a musical set in the twenties full of fantastic costumes, great dances, villians and wonderful situation comedy. There unfortunately isn't much in the way of extras on the DVD, but the quality of the colors and sound make this DVD the perfect medium to view this film."
5,Thoroughly entertaining!,I watched this with my granddaughters who are ages 11 and 6. Both enjoyed it very much. It is so nice to have a wholesome movie to watch together!
5,Thoroughly Modern Millie,This movie is well directed. The actors enjoy their roles and perform well with each other. The 'violence' is comical but not slapstickish. The teenager who watched it with me enjoyed the movie. A good choice for a family evening of entertainment.
5,Christmas,I can't say how much I liked it because its a Christmas present. It was much wanted and I'm sure will be appericated.
4,Thoroughly Modern Millie,"Unfortunately I had to return this movie as the person it was bought for already had it. So, it is impossible for me to give a rate/review."
2,Nothing like the Broadway show!!!,"With the exception of a few songs and key lines I found this movie to be extemely disappointing in comparrison to the Broadway show. In my opinion, Julie Andrews lacked the spunk that Millie's character required and Carol Channing was just horrible as Muzzy! I do think Mary Tyler Moore was a very good ""Miss Dorothy"" and I was impressed by the dancing, much more so than the singing. If you are wanting to purchase this as a reminder of the Broadway musical, I would recommend purchasing the CD of the songs from the show instead."
2,To be watched only if there's nothing else...,"I did not think too highly of Thoroughly Modern Millie. The acting fell flat (especially the overstatement of Carol Channing) and it was mostly plotless. Plus it was blatantly racist. ""If Mrs. Meers is with the Chinese, she's into something really big..."" Two stars because the idiocy of the movie was funny in spots, and it is good only if there is no other alternative."
5,Thoroughly Modern Millie,"This is a wonderful movie with Julie Andrews at her best. Light, fun and really entertaining - like all her movies you can watch it over and over again!"
5,Thoroughly Silly and Entertaining,"Thoroughly Modern Millie is a hilarious 1920's type comedy. Its about a young girl in the city who wants to be ""modern"" and her adventures with her friends Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore) and Jimmy (James Fox). It has everything you could ask for in a movie: laughs, music, romance, mystery, and excitement. Although I may be a bit biased, considering I'm the worlds biggest Julie Andrews fan! She does a wonderful job portraying Millie! Very cute, not for the serious type though. What it lacks in plot and substance, it makes up for with humor and well...Julie! A great movie, I definitly recommend it!!"
3,Not as good as suggested in Amazon ad.,"Not much more I can say is that it works only okay, skips a bit, and otherwise is way used."
3,"Originally, was good; but the material now seems dated.","""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" is a fairly good comic musical movie. Originally, it was very good. However, the material now seems somewhat dated.The movie is a type of melodrama. The comedy comes from the frantic attitudes and ideas. Unfortunately, we have been oversensitized to ""racism"" and there are parts of the movie that can be interpreted as racist by overly serious and overly sensitive people. All three of the lady stars do FANTASTIC jobs.I do admit that white slavery seems to be an odd subject for a comedy, much less a musical comedy, but it still works. I think it worked better in the 1960s, when I first saw the movie.Despite my praise for the movie, I rank it as three star because the comedy does seem corny today. But, it is a worthwhile movie."
3,Good MoviesThroughly,"I purchased ""Throughly Modern Millie"" an enjoy the DVD. It is entertaining and funny. It is the first time to purchase for this comany, but I found it to be easy and delivery was in a fashionable lenght of time. Would recommend this company to all."
4,Indelible childhood favorite,"I cut my B-spoof teeth on this movie as a preteen...and learned to practice the obscure art of elevator dancing.Even though, as seen by countless other reviews ahead of mine, there are a few random musical bits thrown in for no reason...overall, the movie as a whole does a good job of presenting the audience with an ""innocent"" side of social satire.I was sitting at my desk singing ""cheery bim-bim beery bim-bum bum beery bum beery bum I diddle-um""...the whole time I was typing this. Evidently even the unneccessary parts can be important."
5,Thoroughly Modern Millie,This movie is so entertaining. It is great to watch a terrific moviewhere there is just fun!
1,"Not ""paperback"" version but study guide","What is being called the ""paperback"" version of A Short History of Western Civilization here is in actuality not the paperback version at all but another paperback book entitled ""A Study Guide to Accompany A Short History of Western Civilization from the 1600's."" Richard Sullivan is not the author of THIS book. On the order form and on the packing slip it says ""A Short History of Western Civilization"" but it is not! If what you want is a study guide for half of this book then go ahead and order it. If you really want the entire Short History of Western Civilization book, then order the HARDCOVER version."
5,Love this routine,This is a relaxing and excellent exercise routine. I have noticed an improvement in my body and my mood. I highly recommend this.
5,Not for the beginner,"This is a great workout video, you do have to be familiar with yoga. This video would frustrate a begineer, Kim moves quickly and she expects you to be familiar with the names of various yoga positions. I have been practicing yoga for about 3 years (through tapes and personal instruction)and found this to be a great addition to my Rodney Yee tapes, they compliment each other and it is a good idea to use different instructors and tapes to keep using all those vaious muscle groups working at their maximum."
4,Music that is missing today,"Some great britpop songs which are simple pop/rock songs even though some of them have weird intentions e.g country house and parklife. This album showcases 10 years worth of work from there very first song 'she's so high' which was released way back in october 1990 to music is my radar from the year 2000.Blur's first big hit 'there's no other way' from way back in 1991 is one of the catchy tunes on here. Not many great songs from there second album but the songs from parklife and great escape are instant britpop classics like parklife, girls and boys, country house, charmless man and the universal.The rest shows stuff from there last two albums like the brilliant 'tender'."
4,Probably the best SINGLES band from Britain in the 90s,"While Suede and Oasis, both better bands, consistently put out superior albums to Blur's, I have doubts that either band could release a better singles collection. Blur had a certain variety and catchiness to their short-form releases, which makes this their best cd to own. The new song isn't quite up to snuff, however."
5,Where is chemical world?,"Great cd, but there are some missing songs that are awesome.For example Chemical World, which is for me one of the best songs of blur, with an awesome chorus.Another big one missing is M.O.R its a short song, i dont know why they havent included this song, its fast and very catchy.Other missing songs are: Death of a party, Sunday Sunday, Yuko and Hiro, and Best Days."
4,"Why No Chemical World or Sunday, Sunday?","Who says this is really the best of Blur? I think every Blur fan there is would select a different playlist for this album; I'm no different. Whoever produced this album seemed to have jumped from She's so High and There's no other Way straight to cuts from Parklife carelessly omitting anything done in 1993. A travesty! Chemical World surely has to be somewhere in the top 18 best songs blur have done?Other than this rather large snafu, we have an excellent album; I'm glad to see On Your Own made it in but Coffee & TV? Come on."
5,REM = Blur?? You are on crack.,"The guy who compared Blur to R.E.M needs to rethink that one...you are talking about Blur, right?"
3,Good Brit Pop that can overstay its welcome,"I'm not a huge die hard blur fan, but I like some of the hits that made airplay in the US (though Song 2 isn't the best IMO). But, man, a couple of the tunes that don't have a whole lot more to say than a three minute pop song should hang around for twice that long (beetlebum, for tomorrow, tender - just goes on and on and on). Harmless tunes in and of themselves but stretched out as if it's pure gold that they just didn't have the heart to end. Boys, it's not THAT great. A lot of these Brit Boy Bands take themselves way too seriously (cough... oasis). Parklife is my favorite and weighs in at a reasonable 3:07.Maybe take a cue from Supergrass and keep'em short or make them interesting for the entire ride if you've just got to go past 4:00."
4,That's right!,"The best of Blur, a sweet album! This band bother me all this years, they always have some amazing songs and some boring songs you have to skip skip skip...Like people who bought 13 because of Song 2 will wonder what the hell is this band doing.anyways, I love Blur, they try different kind of music all this year. And it's time I don't need to skip skip skip..."
5,A masterpeice,"Like most people, the song that turned me on to blur is ""song 2"", when I saw the video for ""coffee and TV"" I thought it was crap, it was nothing like ""song 2"". And how wrong I was, now coffee and TV is one of my most fav blur songs, next to ""this is a low"", ""beetlebum"", ""parklife"", and of course ""country house"". Blur is much better than you think if you know them only from ""song 2"".Now the old fued.Oasis and blur are both good bands, when it comes to creativity blur wins. When it comes to consistency Oasis wins."
3,Not Garden Central,"For me it's much too early for a band that was a sickening Drunken mess that made an unexpected comeback in the Melody Maker Tent at Reading '93,(Their Best Gig) to release a Greatest Hits CD. The Running order is abit of a Blur as well. I've seen Blur play over 100 times, Even in America, And still think Their New Cd is a case of Modern life is Rubbish. As most of the Post Woo Hooh and all that ware's off, Blur still have alot to offer, In My opinion Their B-Sides Rule Supreme (Camden) aside, 'Into Another' is the best song Blur have ever Recorded. That even made a comeback in BBC Session Form on Music is My Radar CD1. So to finish (Notice No Review Of Any Tracks!) Don't buy this, Instead Hunt down a good B-Side Cd."
1,This sucks!!! Don't buy it,"Blur is the most God awful band that there ever was! The singers vocals are horrendous! He sounds like a whiny little ....... If you like poor music and wasting money then by all means get this, but if you like GOOD music then skip this steamy pile of dung."
5,Excellent Retrospective,"Blur is by far one of the most interesting bands to come from England, definately the most original. This collection is a must have for old and new fans alike, as it is an excellent representation of their career. Starting off with two big hits, ""Beetlebum"" and ""Song 2"", which the latter has become one of their most recognizable songs and biggest hits. Of course there is the campy and fun songs like ""Parklife"", ""Girls and Boys"", ""Country House"" etc which have become fan favorites, along with the rest of the tracklisting. Some of my favorites include ""End of a Century"", ""She's So High"", ""On Your Own"" and ""There's No Other Way"". Overall this brit bands music is compelling and worth well repeated listenings, so if you need a jumping point to get your introduction to Blur, this is a fine collection to do so."
4,A Great 18 track collection.,"When you own over 700 cd's, it's hard to find the time to listen to them all. That's why I love the best of ""Blur"". It has everything from the first song I heard, ""Boys And Girls"", to my favorite one ""Coffee And TV"". It also includes the excellent tracks ""Beetlebum"", ""Tender"", ""She's So High"", ""On Your Own"", and the huge ""Song 2"". I'd say if you know any of these songs, you'll like them all. Each one is catchy and well crafted. This is also available as a ""Limited Edition"" import which comes with a bonus disc, 10 tracks live at Wembley Arena. But that's fairly expensive, and this should be fine for any casual fan. It's Brit-pop at its best."
2,"poor style, spotty substance","Admittedly, I expected a lot from this book. I had just learned about Bernays from Stuart Ewen's book Spin: A Social History of PR & was looking forward to getting a balanced picture of this alleged master. Tye's book did not fit the bill and, unfortunately, most of Bernay's books seem to be out of print. My main problem with the book is that Tye does not document the connection between Bernay's schemes & their outcomes - were Bernay's efforts smoke & mirrors that simply presaged natural turns in public opinion or did they actually manage to influence public opinion? This is the main question that I wanted the book to address, and it simply did not do it. Furthermore, the book is structured non-chronologically, and Tye does not have the skill as an author to bring Bernay's life together coherently in this manner; at best the structure is a good idea poorly executed. Check out Ewen's book for a more cogent history of public relations (including Bernay's innovations)."
4,Must reading for students of US history,"You can't possibly understand the history of the 20th century without coming to grips with Edward Bernays. Bernays bragged in his autobiography that Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels valued his book ""Crystalizing Public Opinion"" above all others in his library. Bernays, a relative of Sigmund Freud, applied his formidable intellect to corporate-sponsored tasks such as convincing women to smoke and demonizing movements for land reform in the Third World. Sadly, this thoroughly amoral individual's outlook on life - bend the truth for the highest bidder regardless of who is harmed - has become the norm, not the exception, among ""communications"" professionals who apply their craft with a charm and polish that belies the often deadly consequences of their ""campaigns."""
4,Our history discarded,"As a non-PR person, I thoroughly enjoyed The Father of Spin because it confirmed my suspicion that a large part of our history was and today still is ""manufactured"" out of the offices of spin. Larry Tye's portrayal of Bernays seems very balanced. However, having read the contents of the book I am inclined to say that the credit given to Bernays is somewhat over-rated by naming him the Father of Spin. One question needs to be raised: Is the information and news we see everyday inspired by commerce or actual events?"
3,"50% term paper, 50% analysis--at best","This book does a disservice to its subject in its failure to communicate the big picture of Edward Bernay's life and work. There's too much focus on fragments, and not enough analysis or overview, to give a true perspective on the ""father of spin."" A dissapointment."
5,"This is a great, great, great book",I am a PR professional. I read a lot of books about PR. This one is definitely on the top of my list. Many thanks and praises to the author for his fantastic contribution.
2,"A lot of detail, little insight.","While the first few chapters of the book are entertaining and informatative, the remaining chapters seem to merely add detail to what was already said.Because the book is not structured chronologically, you are forced to jump back and forth through some 75 years worth of events. In some cases, this forces you to revisit the same events in several different chapters. This makes it very difficult to place events in context. Also, the chapters didn't seem to carry equal weight.The book is very well researched and reported. However, it tries too hard to be objective. For every positive thing that the author says about Bernays, there is a negative thing to counter it. After completing the book, I am left with no opinion about the man and I'm unsure of what exactly he did accomplish."
3,okay but not great,"Larry Tye attempts an ambitious view of Edward Bernays but falls short. While his stories are entertaining he fails to draw a connection between his ideas and the results. Frankly, I found Michael Levine's Guerilla PR Wired to be a much better and useful read."
5,Gloria's view,"I have enjoyed this album, it brings a lot of soul and rekindles love all over again, and again."
2,OK but....,"This album is OK but is not the best. ""Dedicated to the..."" does not have the original long intro that we know and have!!!"
2,good product-poor service,"The product was nice,but I ordered heather grey and received black. I E-mailed the merchant about this problem but received no reply."
1,Vile fluff!,"This is slick, over-orchestrated mush, elevator music. But Jim Hall's other version with Paul Desmond and Chet Baker, ""Concierto"", is excellent."
1,"I COMMENTED ON ""CRISIS""...",Boring. Boring stories. Boring James Gunn. Shoulda changed his name to Ray. Hardy-har-har. (Get it? Ray Gunn...)
4,Eagles Greatest Hits 1971-1975,I have enjoyed the album and have in on my MP3 player. THere is a variety of music and it is energetic.
4,Eagles review,Cant say anything bad about album-every song I wanted was on it. Good deal! I am happy with my purchase.
2,Big Whoop........,9 tepid country-pop songs and one disco song? No thanks. Give me the Paul Cotton version of Poco ANY day!
2,Merely Mediocre,"I must agree with A Music Fan whose review appears above. I recently sold all my Eagles CD's back to the Wherehouse, under the misguided notion that there was an Eagles collection of Greatest Hits with songs appearing from Volume one and Two on it. Sure, people could purchase Hell Freezes Over but what about individuals who liked the Eagles music before they sold out? I hope that someone can get on the stick and make a Greatest Hits CD that spans the two volumes soon and includes other lesser known hits as well. It is the end of a Millenium after all."
1,Nothing special,"The Eagles represented that mid to late 1970's emphasis on safe, no risks, and utterly unchallenging music. Pleasant, unremarkable, and devoid of any real substance, they made music that parents could listen to. So naturally they were huge.The songs were easy to digest, much like corn flakes, which means they are as forgettable today as they were a quarter of a century ago.Time to move on folks."
4,Better without Joe Walsh,"-Yeah I know that may be heresy for me to say that but I really didn't care for ""Hotel California"" or ""The Long Run"" all that much, and preferred The Eagles when Bernie Leadon was with the band. Just my personal preference, ok?This CD takes some of the best tracks from those early (pre-Joe Walsh) Asylum albums and by today's standards, it could have been longer, but the vinyl only had ten songs on it to begin with, so it's consistent.See if you can find this at a steep discount. The same with ""Greatest Hits Volume 2"" which only pulls off tracks from the last two albums with Joe Walsh._"
5,Brilliant 70s band- ultra smooth,"If you've never experienced "" The Eagles"" this is a wonderful place to start. What a great ultra- smooth blend of country, pop and light rock.Has all the great Eagles stuff fromm their first four albums.I guarantee you'll be a fan after listening to this!Essential for your CD collection"
4,eagles cd,I like the music but I think i could have bought it somewhere else cheaper. With shipping and handling its too much for a CD.
5,Truly their greatest hits...,Great CD! This is definitely a collection of the Eagles' greatest hits. This is the music I grew up on. It is great to have it all in one collection. A must-have for any music lover.
4,Feels like the 70's Again!,"I just wanted the hits by the Eagles because, although I was never really a ""fan"" I usually liked their hits. This is a good ""best of"" album with lots of songs you'll remember (if you were around in the 70's!) and probably sing along with."
5,Can't touch this album,"This is the best, ""best oF"" ever released. It is the best selling album of all time with 27 million certified coppies sold acording to the RIAA (recording industry of america).Ps. thats just in the U.Swith hits like ""take it easy"" and ""take it to the limit"" as well as many others this album is a 'must' for any classic rock fan."
5,lets clear this up.,"fantastic album! however, you folks need to get your facts straight. this album is number one in america, not world wide. mjs thriller has sold 45 million copies world wide pink floyds dark side of the moon is second at 30 million copies. the eagles greatest hits is third world wide. dont beleave me. check out the top ten of everything. by russell ash. dorling kindersley pubishing co."
3,"Adequate, but could be so much better.","The Eagles are another great band whose catalog desperately needs to be upgraded (by Rhino, perhaps?) with a full-blown box set, remastered and repackaged versions of the original albums, and a comprehensive single-CD hits package. Instead, we have a ""Greatest Hits"" album that was perfectly adequate for its time (the mid-Seventies) but now should be upgraded or supplanted by a more thorough version. Hell, on a 78-minute CD you could include everything here AND the most essential material from ""Greatest Hits Vol. 2."" And I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer from the 'Stick: include some decent liner notes and session annotations, for gosh sakes!"
4,Half as good as the 2-disc collection.,"These are without a doubt 10 of ""The Eagles"" best songs, and go with the ""Greatest Hits Volume 2"" very well. But I would suggest the new 2-disc ""Very Best of the Eagles"". It has 33 remastered tracks, and includes every song on both ""Greatest Hits"" sets, plus 13 more. Plus it has a good booklet, and a DVD that's ok. Whichever you choose though, it should leave you with a ""Peaceful Easy Feeling""."
4,vintage Eagles,"One of my favorite groups, and this cd covered a lot of their best work. Good vendor and good quality recording"
3,"Not Bad, But You Can Do Better","The music here is easily worth 5 stars. But this outdated and extremely incomplete collection isn't.Sure, in 1976, this wasn't a bad idea. But in 2010, you would be much better off buying the 2-CD set ""Very Best of the Eagles."" It spans their entire original period, 1971-1980, and includes all the big hits. This album seems like a budget release in this day and age simply because more definitive collections have been released since.The Eagles are one of my top favorite groups but to buy this album would be to ignore the brilliant second half of their career -- the half that gave us the masterpieces ""Hotel California"" and ""The Long Run."" The 2-CD set from 2003 covers it all, and that's what true Eagles fans ought to have."
5,A classic compilation of early Eagles' masterpieces,"The Eagles' early albums were a hybrid of country, pop, folk, and rock, and they virtually defined the southern California rock sound. And these 10 tunes capture the Eagles at the top of their game. There does seem to be a troubling streak of sexism running through the lyrics in songs such as ""Witchy Woman,"" ""Lying Eyes,"" and ""Take it Easy."" Yet while some of these songs may score a zero on the political correctness meter, they are so tuneful and real that they nevertheless connect and resonate with the listener. And where would modern country music be without the influence of the Eagles?"
5,Love it!,Great CD. Glad I bought it. Not a bad song on it. I enjoy listening to it. I would recommend this cd to all Eagles fans.
5,good memories,"Pretty good. Almost like my album from ages ago. I wouldn't have gotten a CD, but it's impossible to play/listen to an album in the car!"
5,The greatest from a legendary band,"This is a compilation of The Eagles's greatest hits from 1971-1975. Few have enabled the release of a greatest hits within only four years in a career. These tracks remind the audience how truly great The Eagles are. Every track on here is a classic, which are still frequently played on the radio. They define the missing parts of today's rock music as they express their true musical talents. Their ballads: ""Best of My Love"", ""Desperado"", ""Witchy Woman"", etc., define this compilation as the singer marvelously sings with deep soul. Their upbeat rock tracks: ""Take It Easy"", ""Already Gone"", and ""One of These Nights"", etc., define 70's rock music. The songs express their necessary emotions regardless of who's singing lead. Those who are pleased with this album should also buy ""Greatest Hits Volume 2"", which compiles the remaining 70's and early 80's."
4,Comprehensive,"A nice collection of the early days of the Eagles. Peaceful Easy Feeling, Take It Easy, Witchy Woman, etc. are classics that will always be special. It avoids my five star rating as On The Border in my humble opinion is the premiere Eagles album to own with its diversity of styles and textures. However, for those choosing the quick route to collecing this band, this compilation should fit your bill."
2,This is the Eagles?,Desperado was a pretty good album. This is....easy listening. The Eagles got a lot better after they got Joe Walsh.
2,not the product that is advetised,"This is NOT an import, it is the generic greatest hits found in stores. It is not housed in a mini lp slip case, but the normal jewel case found in stores"
3,Ho hum,"The Eagles were pleasant and bland, therefore widely popular. It's not bad, but there's no way it could be great. No risks at all."
2,The most over rated greatest hits collection?,"I'm sorry, but in my opinion, The Eagles were mediocre until Joe Walsh joined the band. ""Hotel California"" is and always will be their best work and easily deserves five stars, but this is a boring collection of dull songs. Why even buy it? Gee whiz, just turn on your favorite classic rock radio station and within several hours, it's likely that you will hear most of these songs. Classic rock radio is over rated,too, but that's going off the subject. Unless you love early Eagles, save your money or spend it on ""Hotel California"" (5 stars) ""The Long Run"" (4 stars) or ""Eagles live"" (4 stars but a must own for ""Seven Bridges Road."")"
5,"They're are still loved, even after 3 decades for a reason!","I just wanted to respond to a previous entry about the Eagles being better without Joe Walsh! Of course that is a personal opinion, however here is mine! I love the Eagles, and without Joe Walsh, there would be no Eagles!! Those guys together, are like magic.. This CD is by far one of the best CD's I own! Not only do I recommend it, I encourage it. All of the songs just get you rockin, whether you're on the road, at work, or just hangin out! I was lucky enough to see them perform, and let me tell you, they brought the house down, every single one of them!"
4,EAGLES KICK A$$,"It F***IN rocks out.If you are a big eagles fan or you don't even like the eagles, you will still say that this album rocks out.Rock the F*ck ON!"
5,A Great greatest hits package,"this is one great eagles greatest hits package on one disc, so why would you want to buy that limited edition disc? it does'nt make alot of sense for the record company to repackage this album when it already has ever track you'd ever want in my opinion. this cd rocks & is one of the best i own as far as my beatles , creedence & queen discs are concerned . i play this more to put me in a good mood for the day. personally if i want the extra tracks i'd go & buy the early albums no offense to record company. i'd definely say go & buy this album you won't regret it.Highly recommended.Hey where is another eagles concert dvd or video to replace hell freezes over it's kinda of boring in spots? come on people."
3,It is what it is.,Holds 4 hard drives. Fan works. I bought this because my other one was full. It came with 4 left connectors!! It is supposed to come with 2 left and 2 right! Thank god I had extras that my case came with.
2,Banquet folding table,"Although a well made table, it was delivered damaged. It looked as if it had been thrown around by either the delivery people or the people that shipped it. This was due to the fact that the table was wrapped in plastic rather than being packaged properly. What a shame."
5,Fun tunes with a reggae beat,"This is great summer fun music. Open up the sun roof and cruise down the highway with these tunes. As well as we all know Red Red Wine, it is only the appetizer to whet your appetite for the rest. By the way, the sound quality is excellent, complementing these tunes."
2,Not what it seems,"This CD does not have the songs that are listed on this site. ""Here I Am"" and ""The Things You Do"" aren't on this CD. Beware, the ""Red, Red Wine"" version is cut short also. Don't buy it unless your really know what it is you're getting."
3,Incorrect Song List!,"The song list preview that amazon has for this cd is INCORRECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This particular cd does not have ""The way you do the things you do"" or ""Here I am"".Okay,here is the exact songlist for this cd:1 Red Red Wine2 Kingston Town3 Higher Ground4 King5 Cherry Oh Baby6 I Got You Babe7 Come Back Darling8 One In Ten9 The Earth Dies Sreaming10 Watchdogs11 Don't Break My Heart12 Can't Help Falling In Love13 Sing Our own Song14 Tell Me It's True15 Rat In My Kitchen16 Bring Me Your Cup17 Light My Fire18 If It happens Again19 Food For Thought20 Many Rivers To CrossThere you have it folks,now you can decide if you want this cd or not :-)"
3,bring me your cup,"my best song is bring me your cup, other is cheery oh baby, can't help folling in love is the best of my, all of your labour of love voulume 1,2,3 is very best. higher ground, promises & lies. the best of ub40 volume 1&2 is very very good."
3,Breakfest in Bed?,"Good CD, but wasn't ""Breakfest in Bed"" a good enough song to be included in this package?"
3,"Good enough to buy, but...","Okay, I admit, I bought this because I always said if UB40 came out with a greatest hits I'd add it to my collection. However, I only recognized 4 songs on this CD, and 3 of which were reason enough to buy it, at least for me. I also do not have any other UB40 stuff in my collection, hence, it made sense to buy this."
2,SATAN NEVER SLEEPS,"SATANIC is ulimately silly and amateurish but it is perversely interesting enough to subdue horror fans who yearn for the days of really good horror movies.A young girl is in an auto accident and horribly mutilated. Kindly Dr. Angus Scrimm reconstructs her face and she emerges beautiful but with no memory of who she is. She is placed in the youth shelter from hell where she encounters three other troubled teens and is haunted by ghastly visions. James Russo turns up as some kind of hobo and Jeffrey Combs flits in and out as a weary homicide detective. Climaxing in one of the worst fight scenes on screen, the twist is pretty obvious. Not a classic but not a true turkey!"
2,Johnny Lion's REALLY bad day,I had this book as a kid and it scared the crap out of me! The book's about a poor little lion who halucinates due to this terrible red medicine his mother insists on giving him. He has these terrifying visions of monsters and I really don't think this book is suitable for small children. Too scary!
2,Not a great story,"I just read this book to my niece last night. It is an ""I can read"" book, designed for young readers, but it is rather lengthy, which is why I think I ended up reading the book to my niece. Plus the dialogue is a little forced... a lot of repeating the phrase 4 times in a row ""Oh no oh no oh no oh no"". I understand a little repetition is good in children's books, but this one kind of was overkill.I think kids starting out with reading will get bored half way through the book because its rather long. And the older kids that want longer stories will get bored with the actual story line.I did pick up on the craziness of the ""hallucinations"" after the medicine. That was kind of odd, then again, if I read right, it WAS published in the '70s."
3,"repertoire top drawer, performance less so","I was looking for a lively performance of Boeuf Sur Le Toit and chose this recording for the several works I was unfamiliar with. I don't regret the choice as the works are all quite lovely and the performances sensitive. In all of them , including Boeuf, the New London Orchestra under Donald Corp does an excellent job of bringing out fascinating and quirky secondary voices that marvelously enrich the experience of the works, Boeuf included. That being said these are, overall, rhythmically bland renditions. This is perhaps not so important in the lesser known works but for Boeuf sensitivity is less called for than unbridled high spirits and in that regard, this well considered performance is decidedly underwhelming."
5,So useful in so many ways!,"I originally bought one of these to store vitamins and meds for my kids when we travel. One at a time, I've bought several more, since they are so very useful. I keep the jewelry I wear most often in one, and it's so easy to pack up and drop in my toiletries bag when packing. It's great for keeping almost any small items in. I'm so glad I have them."
2,Don't bother,"This DVD was a major disappointment. They have no music by George Harrison. There is music, about three songs, just background noise, and not even done by George or the Beatles - some other group. It's mostly some childhood friend talking about George and their school days - very boring. George Martin and some other guy also talk. There is no worthwhile footage of George. It is so poorly done. I would not even recommend to a die hard fan of George's, which I am. There is absolutely no worthwhile information."
5,worth it.,"I loved it. It worked and still works. I think the instructor it great. As for all those people who didn't like it I think it was a little to much of a beginners tape for them. This was my first introduction to anything even resembling Pilates or Yoga and that style exercise and I can't make it to a gym so it was nice to have all those icons reminding me and teaching me and everything was useful knowledge. The people who found it painfully easy should be being perhaps intermediate DVDs instead, this is a definite beginners tape and works very well."
3,I would recommend this for a good introduction into pilates,"I bought the DVD version. For someone that's new to pilates, I think it's a good one to get started with. I acutally wished the intermediate workout was a little longer though. I also liked the instructions at the beginning. It was easy to follow and helped when I started the intermediate workout. I thought the rest periods for breathing needed to be a little bit longer as well. Overall, it's pretty good. I'd recommend it."
4,Great product,I already bought this dvd for myself a couple of years ago and really liked the explainations on how to use proper form for beginners. It was recommended to me by a pilates instructor I had a couple of years ago. I bought this dvd for a friend that was interested in pilates after having her baby and didn't have the money or time to go to a pilates studio. She loves being able to have the time to workout with this dvd and also spend time with her daughter too. I would definitely recommend this dvd to everyone.
5,"Love, love, love this DVD","This is so fantastic! I started out taking Pilates classes, but the cost became prohibitive. So, I came across this DVD. I've always enjoyed the Dummies books, so I figured this was worth a shot.It's a KEEPER! I started out just renting it from Netflix in case I didn't care for it, but quickly bought it. It's very simple, very straightforward, and very easy to understand. I wanted to do this for expercise and relaxation -- not some ""spiritual journey binding your feet to the grass of the earth"" (I seriously heard that in another one) or something, and this is great for that. I HIGHLY recommend this!"
5,Great for Beginners!,"I was new to pilates when I first purchased this DVD and now I am hooked! I recommend this video to anyone who is just starting out as opposed to someone more experienced with the pilates method. As a beginners video it is easy to follow with a pleasant instructor. More importantly, this workout is not intimating. A great first pilates DVD!"
3,a good gateway,"I'm amazed at how rave these reviews are. The reason why I got the tape was because I saw a review in Newsweek. I tried it out and still have it. It's got simple excersizes that really add up in the end. (I always get good sleep at night when I do this workout during the day.) However, I get discouraged because I don't feel as challenged as I would like. I don't see the results that pilates promises, but that is also because I don't do this religously... I wouldn't be able to, it gets old pretty quickly. So, now I am researching for better videos that suit my taste."
2,"It's fine, if you can stay awake","I found this video to be a good introduction to Pilates itself, however, *extremely* boring. When they mean ""for dummies"", they REALLY mean ""for dummies"", because they spend SO much time explaining everything up front. They do walk through the positions with you and describe them well, but then go a bit fast for a beginner to keep up and get into the next position. Overall, though, after you've watched it a time or two and have memorized the positions....it just about puts you to sleep."
5,No Longer A Dummie!,"I brought this tape not knowing what to expect about a month ago. I figured it was time to try something new, since I became quite tired of just weight training 3x a week. Luckily for me Pilates for Dummies has turned out to be my new favorite video! Its actually made me look forward to working out regularly! Yes I said it! All you need is a mat and a towel and you're off for 30 minutes of 'core' conditioning. Which after the first try you will surely feel the next day! I also really like the instructor Michelle-not to bubbly to annoy, and not to dry to bore you to death. In fact I enjoy her so much I'm ready to move on to an intermediate tape of hers-Breakthru Core-Conditioning. Good luck Pilates Dummies, it works for me and hopefully for you too!"
3,Buy the DVD edition instead,"I watched my sister's DVD edition and loved it. However, the VHS edition is missing the intermediate workout, so I found the tape way too easy. It does give excellent instruction for beginners, but you'll quickly outgrow it."
5,excellent job,"well done video, with all the key points covered. please note that the last two exercises on the beginners workout are really advanced exercises. the pace is workable, background music unobtrusive, and the instructor has no annoying qualities. enjoy!"
2,Difficult!,"Am I the only one who found the basic workout difficult? The pace was too quick for me to get the right technique in the poses and even though I have done this workout several times now, my back almost always is very painful for at least 24 hours afterward. I have found that, apart from a few exercises, the intermediate workout is easier."
4,"Good one, but I have problems.","Well, I agree with most reviewers here. It is a great video to learn Pilates: nice demonstration and clear explanations. And it is low-impacted. I have weak knees, but it is OK for me to do the tape.However, I do have some problems/questions. Does anyone feel strained on their neck while doing the Ab session, and feel pain on their wrists during the last couple of moves? For the Ab part, I am pretty good with my Ab muscles, but my neck is killing me. Is it OK to drop the head on the mattress while doing those moves? Or, probably it is better to seperate rather than doing them altogether according to the sequence shown in the tape."
2,Off The Mark,"This video has good production value, yet is restricted only to basic Pilates movements; it does not demonstrate how you can progress in the Pilates method. Another limitation of this video is that it does NOT include the importance of flowing movement, rhythm, dynamics, and energetic tempos, all of which Joseph Pilates believed are essential to his method of body conditioning. I would recommend Classical Pilates technique videos because they demonstrate Joseph Pilates original method. It is very important to see the ENTIRE RANGE of exercises to develop and appreciation for Joseph Pilates' brilliant method, and to inspire you to higher levels of accomplishment and energizing fun!"
2,"Not for ""dummies"" or beginners at all","Her first workout is the pilates ""hundred"". I don't know about you, but the average person probably can't lie on their back and put their legs about 90 degrees in the air with their legs pretty straight.I think this video is advanced. The moves following that are even harder.If I was advanced in pilates, why would i buy this workout video anyway?I don't know who they are making workout videos for. They should be making it for beginners, they are the ones that need help."
4,Yes get it!,"I am 38 yrs old and I have never done Pilates before - but I do enjoy stretching and getting a good workout. This DVD does both! I'm a busy mom and dont always have time to workout and dont like the fast pace aerobic workouts - but this I could do everyday! Its great for beginners to learn the basics and step by step techniques to Pilates. I would recommend that you watch it through first and keep a remote (to pause) nearby. Because the instructor is ""an expert"" she tends to go through the techniques with ease when I'm just getting it down - she's on to the 2nd rep. I also like that you can choose which exercise you want to do. And just like all ""Dummies Books"" there are helpful hints and tips along the way. But again - watch it through first b/c some of those helpful hints come when you've already done 3 reps - then you realize your not quite doing it correctly. I would definitely recommend this DVD!"
5,great introduction to pilates,"I had never done pilates before and had only heard of them and how helpful they were. I have a lot of lower back problems, so I spend a good deal of time strengthening my abs. Keeping that in mind, I moved swiftly through the workout without too much difficulty, but despite that, I still get a good deal out of it from focusing on keeping my position as clean and crisp as the instructor does while I do the work outs. Additionally there are a few that I still struggle with (the upward facing pushup where you lift your legs one at a time...thats a tough one for me). All in all it is a great introduction to pilates in general so having this as a starting point, you can get a lot more out of other pilates videos that are not as basic, just by keeping in mind the pointers that Michele provides here...without being agitating :D"
4,Very easy to understand.,This is a very good program for a first time Pilates student to use. It is basic and very explanatory. I like basic when I start something new and this satisfies my needs. Some of the more expensive programs are too advance. Elementry works for me at the beginning. I am pleased.
3,Pilates for Dummies can be better.,"The beginning lessons went by too fast. There was little depth. I felt rushed. We jumped from one pose to another. I liked Denise Austin's mat pilates workout better because she took her time with the exercises.Also, the intermediate pilates was way too advanced to be intermediate."
3,It's Alright...,"First of all, I think Pilates is something left better off at a gym or a class where you have an instructor to make sure you are doing the moves correctly. I had a hard time following this dvd, and I am a very quick learner. I always found myself straining to do a move while watching the screen to make sure I was getting it at least halfway right. It wasn't good at keeping my attention, kinda boring, no music. But I could definatly feel the burn for a few days and it was nice that they show you the Beginners version of the moves so you aren't killing yourself. But I was never confident that I was doing the moves right, which could leave you looking worse than you did before you started by bulking up the wrong sections of your body. I felt more comfortable doing a pilates class at a local gym."
2,Good Yet Too Basic,"I bought this DVD because I assumed the Dummy collection(s) have something usefule for everyone. But have you ever bought a video and wanted your learning to grow with it? I found this video on the slow side. There's actually too much teaching, and too much interruption of exercises. It was hard to get a good vigorous workout. Although they show some so-called intermediate exercises, I didn't feel challenged. Although the Dummy collections try to be everything for everyone, this video did not inspire me."
2,Where's The Inspiration?,"This is a good video, but only for very basic viewing and reference material. I love Pilates because it's fasinating and inspiring! When you experience the energy and inspiration of traditional Pilates taught by true Pilates professionals, you will want to keep Pilates in your body forever.This video is not traditional because you don't see the full range of exercises and mat levels, and because passion is missing. What happens after you see basic Pilates exercises and you want to learn more? Answer: take lessons from a certified instructor from Joseph Pilates' original method. Then you will feel how exciting this method really is! Your energy will improve as much as you posture!"
3,Pain,I really like the video.It is harder than it looks!Has anyone had problems with their neck doing this or any other pilates excerises?joan
2,Should not be listed in Stretching Video category,I rented this DVD and was surprised at the lack of warm up and cool down. It was really more like a reference guide for moves.
1,Pick another pilates tape,"I was very disappointed in this video. This one will stay on the shelf and gather dust. There is no warming up prior to doing the exercising, which makes getting into the positions hard, because the muscles are not warmed up. Also, the instructor is extremly fast performing the positions for this being a dummies program. If this is your first time of trying pilates I would find a different dvd.I wish I would of spent my money on a different dvd. I enjoy yoga and Tai Chi but this was my first time doing pilates. I have no desire to carry on with pilates. I will stick to Yoga and Tai Chi."
5,great!,"i was worried about trying a workout video but it was a lot better than i expected.-the instructor isn't annoying! she's nice but not overly peppy/fake.-the exercises are a great workout!-i didn't get bored.-great pace. although sometimes i hit pause.i'm not in very good shape but i don't have any back problems or other health problems so this tape wasn't too hard for me. the video has great tips to make things easier though!i swear she's psychic! as we started an exercise she'd say ""make sure you're not sagging at the (whatever)"" and i'd look at myself and realize i was in fact making that mistake. that's great they help you correct yourself otherwise i might hurt myself or not get a workout.this dvd is cheap too!!plus when you get really good you can try the advanced tips or watch the intermediate video with the faster pace and bigger ranges.:)"
2,I must have done this wrong,"I wanted to buy this, but rented from the library to try it out first. I did the easier/beginners workout. I thought the pace was great. She tells you at the beginning she will do it first to show you, and then you do it together. Once in a while it had little side video of what not to do to break form. As I worked out I thought ""man, I'm going to be sore tomorrow"". A couple of the exercises I couldn't even do (like laying on your stomach and lifting your legs and shoulders off the ground). However, with as hard and effective as I thought this video was when I was doing it, I did NOT wake up sore the next day. At all. I should have which tells me I was doing all of the moves wrong somehow. Something was missing in the video. Something that would have helped me have an effective workout. I am puzzled."
3,"Good workout, BUT.......","I purchased the VHS version of Pilates for Dummies and I found it helpful, BUT a bit irritating--Michelle Dozois is great at explaining the DO'S and DON'TS of the Pilates moves, However she doesn't help you count the movements--I believe she does 10 of each type--18 routines. I also feel she left a few important explanations out--How to breathe--from the chest, not the abdomen, because you 'hold' the abdominal muscles tightly in (navel to spine) while concentrating on the correct form of the excersize; the Pilates stance, a VERY important part of all the different excersizes....Also, the hints and wrong ways to do the movements pop up while you are trying to concentrate on the excersize--very distracting as most of Pilates relys on breath, concentration, and quality of movement. Other than that, this video was very informative--moving from one excersize to the next with ease. Keeping up was my main challenge :)"
3,Almost to easy,"I found that this video was easy. I have just started my pilates routine and after a week, I find the video too short and unchallenging. If you are just starting up from a sedentary lifestyle , then this should be perfect. Great for someone who is recovering from surgery, you're not jumping around like an aerobic workout, but still getting exercise by strengthening your body."
5,Great Teacher,"This is probably the best beginning Pilates DVD around. I've got about four, but this one gives concise instructions. In some cases it still moves a little quicker than I'd like, but I'm just starting out and haven't done some of the excersises. I'm also taking a class for beginners and this helps learn the correct breathing, and correct positions."
5,Great workout.,Easy to follow even for an out-of-shape person like me. Just long enough to feel the results.
4,A very good introduction!,"It starts off slow with a lot of introduction, but eventually covers 18 Pilates moves at a good pace.Probably the only real gripe I have - and it's a big one - is that modifications to make the moves easier or more challenging are shown AFTER you've started the exercise - sometimes even halfway through."
4,Simple but not easy! Great for beginners,"I'm new to Pilates, I had bought another tape that bored me to tears so I thought I'd try this one, based on good reviews I had read here. I think the instructor is sympathetic, not glitsy and non-intimidating, all important things for beginners. The exercises are done at a reasonable pace, not too fast, and there aren't too many reps to discourage people. There's two programs, beginners and intermediates, but the beginners program is perfect for me now...it runs about 30 minutes in length but with a DVD you get to pick and choose which exercises you'd like to concentrate on. I noticed results almost immediately, especially in the abs, because Pilates is great for the stomach, and I haven't lost weight, I've just toned! I highly recommend this tape for anyone just starting out on Pilates and not wanting to get discouraged. There's no fancy room full of beauties, there's no fancy sets, ocean in the background or any of that stuff...it's lowkey and NOT boring."
5,"My first shot at Pilates, and I love it!","I'm not sure if I'll ever feel the need to move on to a more advanced Pilates program, but for now, as a beginner, this DVD is excellent. I am definately seeing results. My favorite thing about this video is that I can do it every morning (sometimes I'll do it a second time at night instead of my evening 2-mile walk), be sweating like crazy, burn calories and tone my muscles, and not feel exhausted afterward. I take a short break to have a glass of water and I'm ready to get on with my daily routine.I highly reccomend this video for anyone just starting out."
1,you better have strong back muscles for this one.,Don't attempt some of these exercises if you have lower back problems. This is not for beginners.
1,For the life of me I can't bend like that!!,Okay so this is Pilates for Dummies - maybe for me they should write Pilates for Fools! I've watched these moves and tried them but to no avail - I got confused with the breathing when to's and not to's and the rolling! My Lord! This tape is not for beginners which I am - it goes on the belief that the watcher knows what the heck they're doing! It also is not for people who are any bigger than the instructor! Sheesh! Not worth the money - very disappointed in this.
1,Too Much Instruction,"This video has very good production quality, and it is well organized, yet there is so much instruction that you do NOT get a good workout. Pilates should be a vigorous workout, and you should sweat! Explaining too many details removes the zest and fun and life from your movement! The Dummy series has a good reputation, yet it is possible to dumb-down too much. The main purpose of exercising is actually defeated when you do not get a good workout that will energize you and make you feel better."
2,Men & Pilates: Where Are They?,"Why do you seldom see men doing Pilates? I bought this video but was somewhat disappointed. Although the woman who primarily demonstrates exercises seems good, it's sometimes good to see male strength and stamina show a workout. This helps me understand that Pilates is NOT only for women. So I looked high and low for a DVD that has a man who practices Pilates. I finally found one: Classical Pilates. Don't get me wrong, Pilates for Dummies is OK, but I just couldn't connect to all the explanations and talking. It was better for me get another DVD that had a man do the workouts, and to have a master instructor---who is also a man---teach me and challenge my abilities."
3,Great beginner workout,"This is truly a beginner workout, which is what I needed after 2 c-sections.The dummies icons interrupting were a bit annoying, and the modifications were shown at the point in the exercise when you are almost done it...I didn't understand that?I prefer: ""easy pilates"" with Ana Caban, it is filmed outdoors, and I found her teaching style a bit easier to understand.but overall it was a good BEGINNER workout."
5,Worth every penny!,You will improve everytime you solve problems on this book. Very solid contents with passages that are really going to help you on the MCAT. Although I think they are harder than the real MCAT problems (some questions are vague) you will learn alot by doing it rather than reading it.
1,Unusable,"There are so many errors in this book it's laughable. They have a forum on their website that tries to give corrections, but it's so badly organized that I spend more time looking for the corrections than I do doing the test itself. It reads like it's been written by a non-native English speaker. I'm using a Kaplan book that's infinately better."
2,Stick to the real AAMC practice exams.,"The problems and passages in this book might be a nice supplement but in my opinion, just doing the practice AAMC exams available through the MCAT company should be sufficient for the BS section. I scored an 11."
3,Too much writing,"Bought a used copy, just not happy that there was too much writing in it. Writing practically on every page which made this book kind of useless."
2,Extensive coverage... but full of errors.,"I bought this book looking for a good passage-based practice for the biology section of the MCAT. From my experience with the book 101 passages in Verbal Reasoning, I was impressed with Examkracker's accurate represenation of real MCAT questions. However, I soon found numerous errors in the questions used in this book, and I confirmed that they were wrong with several physiology and biology professors. From that point, I gave up on the book, because it caused more harm than good."
4,Drinking from a Fire Hydrant,"The questions and quick passages in this review really was great, I could simulate that worn out feeling you get as you start the biological science on the actual test by doing an hour of study in the Examkrackers Biology or O-chem book then going at it with all these questions. Many of the questions asked are very good thought questions and I didn't find as many mistakes as other reviewers had noted. I ended up doing each and every last question in this book I didn't think there was much improvement to be made once you hit double digits but I was happily surprised. For self-study before the new MCAT format comes out I totally recommend the these 1001 question books to solidify that science base."
5,Rick springfield - rocks the house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Rick has come up with a tremendous driving sound on this album.The energy on this cd is surreal. However, Rick has produced the greatest ballad or slow song of his career. A message song, ""ANGELS OF THE DISAPPEARED"". This song should be on the radio and heard by everyone. Everyone who has ever lost someone or has not lost someone. It makes you think about the ones you love and the loss people feel when you do not know what happened to someone. RICK this song,""ANGELS OF THE DISAPPEARED"" is every bit to lost people what Allan Jacksons. ""Where were you when the world stopped turning""? is to the people of the U.S. after 9-11AWESOME JOB!!!!!!!! THANKS FOR THE CD."
1,Not Up To Par With Rick's Other Effort's....,"I Have to agree with the other review, about this album falling short of his other work in the past- notably Karma and WCD. There seems to be a constant theme of anger and rejection throughout, that becomes exhausting. I understand the venting on maybe a few songs, but to have to endure this on all 17 tracks, is not enjoyable. The singing feels forced...Also missing is the natural progression, from song to song. What made Love Somebody, Jessie's Girl and Human Heart so excellent was the great pop hooks, and great emotion- unfortunately not present on this record. Will I is the only track that comes close, but not enough to salvage the rest of this record, to give it a recommendation."

Will I, is the only track that comes close, but not enough to salvage the rest of this record, to give it a recommendation."
1,Not on board with SDAA,"First off, let me start by saying I am a HUGE Rick Springfield fan. I have been since the early 80's. I have seen Rick in concert over 25 times and his live show is spectacular. I have every cd Rick has made in my collection. I even had the pleasure of meeting Rick twice and he seems to be a good guy. But I've got to be honest, this is not Rick's best effort. I understand Rick not singing about ""scoring"" with girls in the back seat of a car anymore, but why are you so angry?! I tried to listen to the whole cd, but I had to listen to it in stages. I could not take the bitching and moaning for long periods. In all fairness though,""Will I"" is great song and should get some serious radio play. As for the rest of the cd, stop complaining. Rick is a talented musician and song writer, but you would'nt know it from his latest effort. So, until Rick's next cd, I will have to rely on his past efforts."
5,This isn't your mama's Rick Springfield!,"If you're expecting to reminisce over the old RS tunes of the 80's, this CD won't help you; however, if you've always enjoyed this man's musical range of raw emotions and songwriting and guitar talents, you will defintely appreciate this compilation. I've got four words that sum it up: ""This CD kicks @$$!"" I was fortunate to hear a few of these songs at RS's last concert in Kansas City, so when I saw the announcement that his new CD was being released, I jumped online to Amazon and bought my copy immediately. CAN'T WAIT for his return!!I'm anticipating a few hits already... ""Idontwantanythingfromyou""... ""Will I?""... ""God Gave You to Everyone""... to name a few. Now we just need to bug the heck out of the radio stations to get these on the air."
5,You and I should age this well.,"I confess, I'd almost forgotten about this guy. SDAA took care of that in a hurry.""Perfect"" is an aptly-named three-minute warning shot across the listener's bow, and things don't go much downhill from there. ""Idontwantanythingfromyou"" is loud, synthy, somehow simultaneously retro and modern, and seriously fun. ""Jesus Saves"" is sarcastic bliss. And let's not overlook the irresistably catchy ""The Invisible Girl,"" which delivers a blatant musical quote from ""Jessie's Girl"" in its bridge: it's Springfield's way of saying, ""Hey, I've earned this,"" and it's hard to disagree.(BTW, if you like this one: be sure to check out Michael Penn, who's a bird of a feather.)"
5,The best rock CD I've heard in years.,"This is one of the most interesting, well-written--and hard-rocking CDs I've heard in a long time. It's raw, yet well-crafted, with hooks galore and lyrics that will stay with you. Too many of today's artists seem to rely on songs that are a lot of flash and little substance. There's none of that here. Springfield writes in intricate layers of meaning, coupled with guitars that grab you by the throat and won't let go. And yet, the quieter tunes are just as good-particularly ""Your Psychopathic Mother,"" and the bluesy ""Alien Virus."" The richness of this collection grows with each listening. Springfield has long been underrated, but for this CD to continue the tradition would be criminal. If you like your music safe and sedate-this is not for you. If, however, you're a fan of songwriters who also happen to rock-or rockers who also happen to write songs with substance, run, do not walk to add this CD to your collection."
5,Not what you'd expect...but still AWESOME!,"This is a real departure from Rick's usual pop style - it rocks and it rocks hard! Much edgier and angry than his usual fare. If you're looking for Jessie's Girl, you won't find her here... AWESOME! A real must-have!"
5,THIS CD ROCKS!,"I can't even begin to say how blown away I am by this new album by Rick Springfield. WOW! I can't even pick a favorite song...they are all soooooo good! Jesus Saves White Trash Like You is one of the best rock songs I've heard! Idontwantanythingfromyou is also one of those songs you can't get out of your head.Rick has totally undone himself with this one! If you don't get this CD, you are missing out! This is THE CD everyone has been waiting for from Rick!!!"
5,Perfect,I think the cd is perfect.To all those who did'nt like this cd ...the cd is perfect !!!!!!!!!
3,Let's not get carried away.,"Wow! Most of you people must still have Rick's Tiger Beat posters hanging on your walls.While this collection has some rocking numbers, there are few that actually jump out at you and scream brilliance. In fact, several of the songs sound as if they're actually just one long track as there there just isn't anything really separating them from each other. Don't get me wrong, Rick is a talented guy and can still rock, there's just nothing here that deserves the kind of gushing put forth by his obviously devoted, but starved for good music, fans."
4,Par for the course,"Many reviewers have noted how dark the music is, but I haven't seen anyone put the tone together with the CD's theme. SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE are the demonstrated four stages that a person goes through afterlearning that he/she has a fatal illness. Perhaps RS is making a statement that his fall from popularity and resurgence is analogous...."
5,Totally Rocks!,"Even if you're not an avid Rick Springfield fan,this CD will blow you away with it's intense guitar driven rock songs! A slight departure from his past recent works, this CD showcases the passionate feelings of shock,denial,anger,and acceptance through the hard edged,fast paced rock out music! A great CD to put on and listen loud."
5,best album,"sitting here in edinburgh,scotland 11.00pm,a few beers later and i stick on this cd again. now i love hard rock from the usual suspects but this cd is immense from a guy who used to be a teen idol!!.some of the big guns should listen to this and rethink their strategy.please bring this show to g.b. rick."
4,Back to the Front,"Impressive return to the rock & roll picture show. I saw Rick at the ""House of Blues"" in Hollywood, CA last night and I have to admit that I (like most people there) went for the ""hits."" But he started out with the new stuff, got great audience reaction, and he kept them coming! Needless to say, I picked up ""Shock Denial Anger Acceptance"" this morning and I'll be damned if the energy on the CD doesn't mirror the energy of his live show! The new songs rock from start to finish and he still knows how to play on his strengths. Much like another hard rocking solo artist from L.A., Neil Daly, Rick's hooks and melody lines have never left his side! But most impressive is his actual musicianship. His guitarwork is certainly worth noting, and trust me from seeing him live last night, it's all him! So all in all, listening to Rick Springfield's return conjures up thoughts of a new possible album title... ""Shock Denial Energy Excitement!"""
4,I was SHOCKED at how this one ROCKED!,"Wow, I was certainly not prepared to hear this masterful LOUD IN YOUR FACE rocking music from Rick Springfield! This is some serious hard rockin' stuff that will blow your speakers and get you a speeding ticket. I could do without the ""blurbs"" in between tracks, but the music ROCKS. Hands down. With 17 tracks, certainly getting more than your money's worth! This is one to definitely crank up loud! Rock on Rick!"
1,Not Up To Par With Rick's Other Effort's....,"I Have to agree with the other review, about this album falling short of his other work in the past- notably Karma and WCD.

Will I, is the only track that comes close, but it's not enough to salvage the rest of this record, to give it a recommendation."
1,Bubble Gum Rock Schlock,"It's clear that Rick is indeed in denial. I was highly anticipating his return to his musical roots. Instead, we get kiddy pop/rock fare, reminiscent of that disposable bubble gum rock music from the likes of Dokken, Warrant, White Snake, Et al. He basically whines throughout this record...It's one over the top, unsatisfactory song after another. Rick, stop acting as if you're some broken down old man. Maybe next time you'll get with the program."
5,An Undeniable Masterpiece!!!!,Not a bad song on the entire CD. It kicks butt! Definitely his best ever!! Stop with the Cheap Trick already! It doesn't sound like any CT I have heard! Keep rockin' Rick!
5,Rock 'n roll that will never die,"This CD gets better and better each time you listen. It's the music and lyrics that grab you. It's amazing to think that Rick is now 57 years old! This CD rocks like he was 27.My favorites are ""Wasted,"" with lyrics like ""her e-mails read just like a porno site""; ""Jesus Saves White Trash""; ""Alien Virus"" and ""The Garden of Eden."" The CD starts with heavy metal, but reaches towards ballads after the 10th song. Another lyric: ""I put a Band-Aid on a bullet wound and ignored the infection."" And you get 17 songs.This is a dark but very thoughtful album and not what I expected from Rick. His voice isn't the greatest, but the music will have you dancing. Play it in your car to wake you up in the morning; it's better than coffee."
5,REMARKABLE!,"You'd never expect such an outstanding album from someone who has been doing lot's of soul searching on previous efforts. But..........BUT, this is one of, if not thee...best rock album I have heard in over 10 years. Sean Daly of the Washington Post didn't like it. However, rap fans like him can't understand an American Rock Album anyway. So Daly can keep his ""wanna-be"" hip-hop attitude and waste away with the rest of the gimmicky music that comes and goes. Shock Denial Anger Acceptance is an instant classic that resonates of hard hitting rock, and soulful lyrical blend. The title personifies the journey of the tracks, and flows through the hard-hitters to the ballads. Rick Springfield has truly outdone himself on this one. Do yourself a favor and pick up this CD. You will be quite pleasantly surprised. This is his best effort to date."
2,CUTE AND SMALL,"I GAVE 2 STARS BECAUSE I BOUGHT THIS FOR AN ADULT CHARM BRACELET AND THIS IS TINY LIKE FOR A CHILD CHARM... IT IS VERY CUTE AND WELL MADE, SHINEY, AND THE COLOR IS A SOFT PINK (CUTE)"
5,Grape pods.,"I gave this as a gift, but it is so beautiful. My daughter really loves them. They match a previous gift from Amazon."
1,DONT MEASURE UP,"I bought a lovely necklace that Amazon featured this set of earrings as well as a bracelet with as a ""buy together for"" deal. I was SO incredibly disappointed with these earrings! These were described as 4-5 mm, and the length 1.75"". The image alone is deceiving. The actual ""pearl"" portion is only 1"" long (see images I uploaded). If the seller had featured a picture of them being worn, I would have seen the pearls & overall earrings were much smaller. My husband, an engineer, measured the pearls with a caliper and found they were 3 mm at best, only 2 were 4 mm. The freshwater pearl necklace (from a different seller) looks NOTHING like these earrings and together look mismatched so I gave the earrings to my teenage daughter. For a 16 year old, these are fine, but I wouldn't rate these earrings better than any fake set you could buy at Claire's. I think I'm done purchasing jewelry on Amazon.com unless they start requiring sellers to post more images, especially of the item worn."
2,Horrible mixing,"I saw Bryan Duncan perform this morning at my church, and was very impressed. So I decided to buy one of his CD's. When I popped it in the CD player, I was very appalled to hear some of the worst mixing I've ever heard. There is virtually no bass at all; and only after serious EQ tweaking does it sound even decent. The songs are OK, but it just doesn't sound right with only treble. Do not buy this; buy some of his studio work instead."
4,Excelent and perceptive novel,Excellent and perceptive novel of italian fascist period and its effect on people in that period. Avoids heavy handed dogma
2,disappointing,"While some of the anecdotes are quite humorous, a large portion of the commentary sounds like it comes directly from the mouths of some bitter ex-Mormons/Latter-day Saints. I didn't want an entire book of Mormon/Latter-day Saint jokes--I was looking for commentary of Utah at large. Also, a lot of the tongue-in-cheek humor would be misunderstood by those not 'in the know,' giving a perverted view of the Utah I know and love to make fun of."
2,Two shots and it is dead.,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. She took it out of the box, charged it up and on the second click of the shutter it flashed a message ""turn off and turn on again"". We did. It never recovered despite numerous resets and removing the battery, per Sony customer service rep instructions. The lens is frozen; it cannot retract and the camera stays in an inoperable error state. Sony is telling me to ship it to them. Giving it two stars rather than one because I removed the memory stick and printed the two shots we'd taken and they looked great. Second Sony product in a row that we've had out-of-the-box quality problems with (LCD monitor was the other). Losing our brand loyalty very rapidily."
4,Pleasing camera. High mp gives dramatic detail.,"When you use it, its alot of detail power for it's size.Sometimes it may not focus right on target but you'll get a photo that looks superbly great. At rare times, I do not get the prefered results I need but still looks good.Indoor pictures not with flash end up shaky.Down the road, the extra options and scene modes give you different ways and results to take photos.The video is great with fast frames. Also it lets me get spontaneous images."
2,I can't believe it's a Sony,"I fully agree with the reviewer who gave this camera only 2 stars. I have just tested one, which I bought for my wife as a Christmas present, and everything he wrote about the P150 is true. I spent the whole afternoon, took 152 snapshots, and found not a single mode that would give my wife an easy way to use this camera. Even in full manual mode about 40% of the easy shots I took turned out to be blurred or underexposed or both.I have been a VERY satisfied owned of Sony's DSC-S85, which is a great, great camera. (great lens, very good flash, decent firmware) The P150 is such a disappointment that it is hard to believe it is made by Sony. It has seriously shaken my trust in this brand and I am now wondering whether I should do the previously unthinkable: buy a Canon? :-("
3,No Trimming???,"Great camera and some nice improvements on the p10. Indoor picture quality is better with less blur and the speed to turn on/off and even click to capture picture is a nice improvement. However there is one MAJOR flaw for me in that Sony have decided for some reason to leave off the trim facility. Once you have taken a shot, you can zoom in but unlike previous models you can no longer capture the zoomed image as a new shot which means alot more editing on the PC as opposed to the camera itself. I used the trim facility on practically every shot with my P10 so this is VERY dissapointing.... :("
1,Junk,"When it did work, for about a month, it was ok. Very sensitive to movement, but ok. After I took it with me on a trip I got blurry, dark images under the best of conditions. Otherwise I got nothing at all. Quite often the screen would be almost completely black. Maybe I got the one bad one or maybe they don't survive airport security. I finally threw it away in disgust on my honeymoon."
5,This one's OK to open,The action feature works and the figures will stand even when combined as pictured
1,Golfman1,"In error I was shipped the wrong item, I received Volume 1 not Volume 3 that I ordered. I have requested information about how to exchange for the correct item but have not received a reply."
4,"Very cute and loveable, small pieces a waste of space","These are very cute, although they mostly just bend at the waist so they don't do much. The small pieces will just get lost and you can't relly use them anyway so I would suggest just throwing them away with the packaging. The tops come off and get lost very easy becasue they're so small and it's a little weird to see small topless mermaids around the house. However, all that aside they're very cute and my daughters love them. They have both mermaid sets and the little fairies too."
2,Finicky,Haven't really been able to use as hoped. Have tried on several occasions but before I really get started the nozzle clogs. Using coal slag as the media which is pretty darn fine...but the second you stop the flow of material with stop it backs up and plugs. Air flow settings are key and just haven't found the settings to make it work yet.
5,The promise of 70's hard rock is delivered,"This could be one of the only hard rock cd's you ever need.Fantastic from start to finish, this set shows everything that was right (and excessive) with the music scene in the early 70's.Beyond any rating system"
5,Musically and technically inspired,"I just finished listening to Highway Star and had to write. This is one of the greatest recordings of the one of the greatest rock songs played by one of the greatest bands I have ever heard. Perhaps the greatest. Deep Purple had the perfect rock intonation, phrasing, tone, and dynamics that one expects from a band (they performed from 1969 to 1973), but their musical intelligence, their sense of abandon, and their intense and continuous concentration was extraordinary. I listened to the great Child In Time with tears running down my cheeks, I don't remember that happening since a performance by the Moody Blues many years ago. The recording is technically perfect, clean and clear with appropriate channel separation. It sounds like the mix was done by a musical and technical expert. I can not believe this band is NOT in the rock and roll hall of fame?!"
2,Horrible pressing,"I expected a really nice re-issue of this outstanding concert. Yes, it's 180 heavy vinyl, but the sound is terrible, it's a cd with vinyl-shape, it has nothing to do with the original lp."
5,The greatest live ROCK album?,"I think so. The new Led Zep dosent come close.Music wise I would say Zep have the edge, because they wrote more classics, but recording quality, not on the same planet. Who ever produced this was well ahead of the game. You just dont get live recordings like this, when the band,venue and producer were there for a one off piece of rock history. My comments are based on the gold dcc version, which I only have a copy off now. Lets have it reissued on SACD with somebody like Bob Ludwig from Gateway Mastering doing the transfer.That is the only way this can be betterd.Music this gets 92% and recording 90%."
5,Extraordinary!!!!!!! A million stars,"Deep Purple is the best band of all times...Why Made in Japan is considered the best live album ever made? Because The Purples are the Best, the best Zep or Sabbath song's haven't the level of this tracks...Ritchie, John, Roger and Ians are the maximum...."
5,One of the best live albums ever,"This album is one of the best 70's live albums ever, alongside Led Zeppelin's ""The Songs Remain The Same"". I think that says it all."
5,LET'S HAVE EVERYTHING LOUDER THAN EVERYTHING ELSE!!!,"This is the best live album I've ever heard. Deep Purple is flawless in this cd. Some songs are stretched out very long, but who cares?, Deep Purple really rocks on this album. My favorite on here is Lazy. Jon Lord's intro is fantastic and is a heck of a lot better than it is on the recorded version. Buy it and make everything louder than everything else!"
3,"***** for ""Lazy"" ! ... after that, stay in bed...","""Lazy"", first... and last. Blackmore's Mk II at his best on this title only. ""The mule"" is too long because of his drum solo which is better to be cut off this record. I agree with the no-singing part of ""Space truckin'"" ; ""S.K.O.W."" is unacceptable for our ears ; ""Smoke on the Water"" is really great ; ""Highway Star"" and ""Child in Time"" are not at all at their top because we hear to much Gillan's voice and not enough Glover's bass which could easily supply Lord's keyboards"
5,fly by night,i have this albem on all the release format back in the day yea i show my aged but this is still one of the best from DP ever
2,CAUTION...DELUXE EDITION (US RELEASE),"Purchased this release a few years ago, after ignoring the info I'm about to impart to you.Warner/Rhino have the stereo imaging backwards. I've listened to the mp3 version Amazon offers here and it's also incorrect. If you've ever seen DP live you know Blackmore was always stage left (audience/stereo right) and Jon Lord was hard panned left. This disc has it reversed, so if it matters to you this will be unlistenable. You'll be flip-flopping your R/L cd cables for one disc. If it doesn't matter to ya' then ROCK ON !!"
2,"Sometimes, ""more"" is just ""more""","Did DP Mk 2 have chops? Yes. But ... talk about beating the dead horse. When songs run out of musical ideas, the boys just crank the amps and let 'er rip for 10 more minutes. Nuance and subtlety were not in their collective DNA. Nor was a sense of humor: the whole point of 70s hard rock was to be dumb fun. But pompous Ritchie Blackmore thought he was Mozart with a Stratocaster. My favorite moment is at the end of Space Truckin (sweet Jesus, unplug Jon Lord already!)when there is almost a full minute of silence before polite applause. I imagine the Japanese audience waking up from their 20 minute coma."
2,DISAPPOINTING Reissue,"This release is a compressed unpleasant sounding listening experience. Audiophile my ASS. The original mint condition release I have on vinyl sounds Awesome and a thousand times better to the ear. At first we thought it might be my friends stereo so We then played it on my $12,000 System and it sounds just as bad !. I am glad I didn't purchase it. A good mate of mine isn't happy parting with the money tho. Please AVOID and shop around for an original copy or a 70's or 80's reissue.I really don't understand Record company's releasing Digital remastered Crap like this. Don't fix what ain't ben broke I say."
5,the best live albun forever,This is the best production of the band in a live concert. They did a lot of live concerts during those years but it was terrific and fantastic because they show all of best they had playing music .
5,Classic Tunes You Love!,This is arguably the best live album ever made containing the best of Deep Purple in their prime. It has great track selection and plays like a greatest hits album on steroids. I remember this was one of the first vinyl albums I purchased as a kid and I practically wore it out. Now digitally remastered my daughter and I love listening to this one in the car or at home. Higly recommended as one of the greatest albums of all time.
5,Best Version of Smoke on the Water,"One of the best live albums ever. I played mine so much in the 70's that I wore it out and had to buy another one. Then I replaced it on CD and later transferred it to my iPod. I still play it all the time. The version of Smoke on the Water on this album is better than the studio version on Machine Head. Great album, a real classic. If you have a 70's rock collection then this album MUST be a part of that collection."
5,Better than I Remembered,"What a rush, what a classic, what a time it was. The youth was there. The timelessness. The world was ours for the taken and electricity king. Born in the 50's, living my 50's. Is good to still be alive and sane and be able to enjoy this music as if it was yesterdays. Deep and Purple. That is how it was. Deep Purple is how it is and it Rocks. Loud and Clear."
