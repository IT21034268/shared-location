4,Good so far,Fits well but always get a larger size than you think you need (I had to return one). The material is a bit thick but I guess that is how lap suits are made. I have not used it to swim yet and I hope it holds up well.
1,unhappy,This swimsuit has faded completely after 2 weeks of wear. I am very unhappy with the wear and would not suggest anyone buying it. I have been swimming for 20 years and never had a suit fade this badly!
3,Dolfin Winner HP Back Swimsuit-Royal Blue,This bathing suit seemed excellent but difficult to figure the correct size. It fits tightly but not enough room in the hips so is cut too high for me. I have ordered a size larger to compare before sending one or both back. I like the higher neck and the tightnes so that nothing bounces or seems to slip. There is absolutely no bra support.
4,Incredible,"This is simply the album of 2001 period.This will renew your faith in the young talent out there. This young lady does not fall in the trap that so many have done (Britney,Christina,Mya etc.etc.).She has depth and the album does what so few do nowadays. It lets you think.Buy it!!!"
3,2 FANTASTIC! songs,download the 2 or borrow from the library-tto bad the others weren't as good as clutch...
3,Ani DiFranco Knock Off,"I have listened to the album, and find it bearable. There are some really good melodies, and the production quality is top notch. However this idea of combining hip hop with rock or pop or country is growing old. It's not innovative anymore. Besides lesser known artists have done a better job at it. Also, what makes it hard for me to fall completely in love with Shea Seger's voice is the fact that she sounds an awful lot like Ani Difranco a lot of the time. But, if you can deal with an artist that is highly derivative, then I say buy her cd. It's really not bad at all."
3,"Average, very average","Shea Seger was one of MTV's artists to watch; Shea Seger is one of Tower Records top picks; Shea Seger is one of Dido's favorite artists, and yet somehow, she doesnt quite deserve this.I am aware of many new vocalists coming out on the market today, and Shea Seger is one who is earning loads of praise, but her sound is totally unoriginal. Shes pop music with a Sheryl Crow sound. In fact, her vocals are totally Sheryl Crow, with that throaty mysterious sound, but the music that accompanies her is just SO VERY VERY unoriginal. Its that fake electronic sound that tries to be mainstream with some guitar. One song that really scares me starts off nicely and then goes into some REALLY bad rapper.""Clutch,"" the song that will eventually make her famous, isn't even all that great. I don't particularily recommend the May St. Project, unless you like Sheryl Crow a lot and can talk knock-offs well.SHEA SEGER IS OVER-RATED... VERY OVER-RATED!!!"
4,Naami's Review,Great book for both laymen and students who wish to understand some of the ancient Near East civilizations.
5,This worked like a charm!,"I used the techniques outlined in this book and bought a business without paying even one dollar out of my pocket. I highly recommend these techniques, but you have to be willing to work, and to work the system."
1,Too difficult to implement,"Most sellers of small businesses expect all cash deals. Taking them from that to carrying a majority of the purchase price is a looong way. When I read this book, it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know, and didn't answer my questions effectively on how to actually make this kind of deal happen in reality. I ended up not using anything in the book, when I made my business purchase."
4,Great book!,"Great textbook, great purchase. Shipping was normal, price was good, book was in great condition. The only thing I would say about the book is it has a little bit of writing in it, but nothing damaging or detrimental to the book's usefulness. Just some stars around important points, and a few highlightings; very few of each though. Overall a great purchase, much much cheaper than any bookstores, and in much better condition than any used books I have bought before. Thank you!"
1,Overpriced and unremarkable,"There is nothing new or outstanding in this text. At best, it mimics the Italian textbooks already on the market."
1,Never received order,"A month after I ordered this book, I still have not received it. The seller contacted me once with an apology and a promise to ship. Three emails later, I have not heard back from her."
2,"Washington, DC Metro Map Book - don't expect Maryland","I was very disappointed after purchasing this street map book. Apparently majority of Montgomery County isn't considered Metro Washington, DC. Don't expect to see any streets north of Bethesda - Whiteflint, Rockville, etc. are all missing. This definitely isn't a map street finder for someone living in the MD suburbs"
5,Great cup of tea,"It's great cup of tea! It really helps you unwind after a day at work or a long day shopping, its caffeine free so you can enjoy it at night before bedtime too."
1,"Why the midquels, disney??? Why???","First off, the animation was very nice. But pretty is as pretty does, right? The story is pretty weak and fairly uninteresting, like most disney DTVs today. It's about Tarzan's boyhood. Like I said, it's not too bad, but it's not very original either.This is one of disney's first so called ""midquels"" that later spawned nightmares Bambi 2 and Fox and the Hound 2. I know that some don't feel that way (especially about Bambi 2 apparently), but, if you ever ask those that do like them, the answer is usually that they would have preferred a real sequel. What's with that, eh? Anyway, I'd rent this, there is too much of a chance that you might not like it."
2,Not as good as the 1st Tarzan,It does not continue from the first movie and seems pretty generic.You would think it would continue in his adult life and not regress.
3,Ehhhhh,"The first one was AMAZINGGGGGG, the sequel/ prequel was ok I guess. Animation was weak, my boys still liked it."
3,Kids like-parents don't,It was a little cheesy compared to the first one but my son likes it a lot. Same music :) different voices from original :(
4,Great Movie,My son loves watching Tarzan...he laughs out loud everytime he watches this movie and can recite many of the lines from the movie...A good sequal which isnt always easy to find!
4,Not a Sequal!!,"Ok this looks like a cute movie and I will get it for my Disney animated movie collection. The thing is, they should have called it Tarzan the Early Years or Tarzan Beginings. This is really a prequal. They alreay came out with Tarzan and Jane. That is the sequal. It is life after the two get married and Jane and her dad move into the jungle. That movie was a set up for the Tarzan cartoon series. If you don't beleive me it should be here on amazon somewhere. So this is really a Disney mistake. Just wanted you all to know that. They didn't get the sequal part right like one of you said in a review."
1,STOP STOP STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"disney stop making direct to video sequels! you virtually made a sequel to everything done! and this is not just disney, this also applies to hollywood in general, with after 100 years, have run out of ideas for good. no wonder that the box office is in a 15 week slump (and will indefinitely be in a slump for decades to come) with sequelization of almost every film made over 10 years ago and remaking the rest. And commercials that use old 70s songs to sell yogurt and cars, that is the nail in the coffin!to find originality these days is almost as imposssible as reversing gravity. WELL SCREW YOU HOLLYWOOD!"
4,pretty good prequel,"After reading other reviews of this movie, I decided to rent the DVD. It is a very cute movie! Usually sequels are kinda lame and never are as good as the original movie, but this prequel was good- I enjoyed it right along with my kids- ages 10, 6, almost 4 and 2. I especially liked that it had kid charcters that respected and obeyed their parents - ""yes m'am"" which is how my children are instructed to respond to any adult. I would consider buying this movie and I don't usually buy sequels. Happy viewing!!"
1,Not as good as the original,This is a strange movie. It is definitely not as good as the original. I don't think I would recommend purchasing it. The kids don't even like it.
3,Looks like an amazing movie,I've seen the trailer of this movie and it looks very goodthe animation is as good as the original one and the story is a medequel to the smash hit animated movie TARZAN . It tells the story of young Tarzan and his adventure in the jungleI'm sure it's gonna be better than Tarzan and Jane
2,What an ego,"After checking this book out at the library (thankfully I didn't waste my money on it) I read...and read...and read. Is it only me, or could I just not feel any sympathy for this woman? What pure fluff (I never made it through the entire book)! While her tragedy is one nobody would ever want to experience, it doesn't seemed to have changed her; all that remains is a rather large ego, and shallowness.One reviewer mentioned the book 'I Am the Central Park Jogger'. Now there's a woman who the reader comes away respecting and loving!!!"
3,Lipton is good...Celestial is better,"I don't know if it's the ingredients, or the packaging process, or what, but the Mandarin Orange by Celestial Seasoning is about 100 times better than Lipton's Orange & Spice. Knowing that I could get either one from Amazon, in the future I think I would pass on the discount (got @ 15% off at the time), and get the Mandarin Orange by Celestial."
5,perfect first drum,"I gave this drum to two very young children for Christmas. They have loved it and whack away at will with a real drum sound. Their parents may not agree, but this drum is a winner!"
1,Not happy with this robe,"I am very disappointed in this robe. It had a bad packaging smell, so I washed it right away. It still smelled and frayed. I re-washed it again and it still has a smell to it."
1,Yawn....,"If you wanted to conpare this book to a feature in the Goldstein-edited Village Voice, it would have to be Michael Musto's gossip column rather than the more thoughful social/political analysis of people like Nat Hentoff.Sadly, there's a lot of bitchy personal attacks and parlour psychologising (which will guarantee plenty of attention in the gay press), but little serious engagement with ideas. More disturbingly, there are also frequent mis-quotations, dubious paraphrases, and assertions that are just not supported by actually reading the people he assails for badthink.The only ""attack queer""on offer in this book is Goldstein himself. This is another volume (one among many) for people looking to have their existing prejudices confirmed, but it adds nothing to rational debate."
1,Don't do it.,"Do not buy this wrench. They sent me a 1-7/16"", etched right on the handle, doesn't say 36mm anywhere, wrench.The conversion makes it a 36.5mm wrench.I'm a mechanic, I don't have time to do conversions everytime I need a wrenchand I'd prefer to have a tool that's not as sloppy, brand new, as the worn out tool I was trying to replace."
3,"One of the more obscure & unusual R&B albums of the 80s, but not particularly compelling","This extremely obscure group is fronted by a young woman who has only average singing ability but can play a tight little guitar. Most of the music is hardly soul-stirring, but one interesting piece is the 10 minute medley ""The Drought/Lust Is A Rush"", the second half of which has a weird, spacey background that at least makes for something to offset the trite lyrics. It is her guitar playing that best carries the album."
3,It's gonna be Lonely,"Rare item get while you can. Produced by Joyce Fenderella Irby 1987. Obvious prince Influences on the cd, including the Prince cover""it's gonna be Lonely"""
4,A beautiful writing,A beautiful telling of a missionaries work in southern India to save the children from using them for sacrificial worship.
4,Add this to your collection,"Grant Taylor's voice soothes like Barry Manilow. The Journey is easy listening at its best, well mixed, with excellent instrumental to accompany Taylor's lyrics. Perfect date music."
4,Bien bonito el disco,"This cd volume 5 of this promising series encompasses some extraordinary bachata songs from renowned artists of this category. This volume in particular is extremely mellow and all the bachatas are of the genre ""bachata romantica"" which makes for very easy listening. The selections were well chosen and Platano Records has included the most popular hits of the year of each artist that figures in this cd. It has more merenbachatas than expected of which two are definitely what is known as ""merengue ripiao"" for those of you who are real connoisseurs of tropical music. You will smooth sail through this cd until track #10 and there begins three merengues in a row. Although I tend not to like the inclusion of merengue tracks in this compilation, I still recognize that the cd was carefully organized and the selection of songs was based on popularity. Once again this compilation of the series ""Aqui esta la bachata"" is a great buy and would enrich your collection of bachata music."
1,Not a good camera.,"I was excited to try out the new polaroid camera using the bigger film. What a waste, if you want a great polarid camera you are going to have to go to some special camera shop, if you want a decent one don't buy this just get the old stand by, one step (...), its just as good as this camera if not better."
5,Big Bag,"Loved this bag. It fit four sleeping bags, two blankets, and three pillows. I probably could have gotten some smaller items in as well. The zipper is strong and the canvas too. I foresee no problems of wear and tear in the near future."
5,super storng,this is a great big ass bag what i was expecting and more its strong the metal zippers are sturdy and the space is amazing
4,Great bag,Heavy duty sucker with plenty of room. Probably should come with a shoulder strap because it is a little tricky lifting.
5,Bigger then expected,"So far this bag holds 3 sleeping bags, 2 pillows, afew towels and still has quite abit more room in it. This is a great bag for camping, it holds what you need so all of your things are together in one spot."
4,Super Large Duffel Bag,If you are looking for a large duffel bag than you have come to the right spot. This item is large enough to pretty much be a hockey bag (for a much lower cost). The picture in my opinion is deceiving and the diameter of the bag is almost 2'.
5,"Nice, heavy duty bag","Nice bag for international travel. It is huge! The only downside I have is it does not have side handles, only end to end."
5,Ginormous!,"This thing is every bit as big as advertised! So far, great construction and holds everything! Recommended if you have the space in your car."
4,Timeless....,"These are the Martial Arts Heroes that I grew up with. To have thisfilm in my private library is a real treat. Master Han is a class act (as always). Having studied Kenpo I had hoped to see Master Parkerstep out of his character (in this film) and give more of a demonstration of his incredible hand speed. But, all in all... it has a reasonablygood plot and was well worth the money."
1,"What is this THING doing under ""Elvis Presley""???","Too bad there are no ZERO stars.. This ""thing"" would get it.OK, Parker WAS working for Elvis and so on.But apart from that, which is extremely minor, WHAT is this thing doing under ""Elvis Presley"" when you search for new Elvis Presley DVD's?Amazon sure had a strange way to put things together.Go ahead try it: Type ""Elvis Presley"" in DVD search and you'll get a certain number of DVD's... including this.Come on Amazon... wake up!"
4,Tracklist,TracklistA1 There Must Be An Angel (Playing with My Heart) (Tanimoody Mix)A2 Lotto (Andreas Dorau Mix)B1 You Must Learn All Night Long (Dancing Baby Mix) by DauerfischB2 Mpf (Loop De Loop Mix) by The Maxwell ImplosionBungalow Records Germany
2,Shovel is very flimsy!!!,"I just received this shovel today. It was a size that would fit in my trunk, however the blade connection to the shaft of the shovel was very weak. It was held by one philips head screw. I am going to return it to Amazon."
3,Yep it works,"Handle is a little loose feeling, so I'm keeping this one to use as a spare if the other trunk shovel breaks."
3,"SUNCAST SCS300, 11 INCH AUTOMOTIVE SNOW SHOVEL","SHOVEL IS OK, BUT NOT FOR EXTREME CONDITIONS, SO I CANNOT RECOMMEND PRODUCT. SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A CAR SHOVEL THAT WILL DO THE JOB AND LAST A LIFETIME. THERE ARE COMPACT SHOVELS THAT ARE USED TO DIG OUT BURIED SKIERS AFTER AN AVALANCHE. BUY ONE OF THOSE."
2,"Music is good, but everithing else is boring","Music is good, but everithing else is boring. My kid did not want to wach it for a minute, comparing to other videos that could watch for hours."
1,Disappointing,This dvd dis not interest my ten month old or my two year old at all. And the jazz and other music arrangements I found less than mediocre. Overall this dvd is overpriced and a disappointment.
5,Awesome!,"I have a very active baby! She does not care for Baby Einstein DVDs, but LOVES Jazz Baby Jazz. Her eyes are glued. It is the greatest thing for helping me get dinner ready! Thank you!!"
1,Not Interesting at all,It's called JAZZ and the music is dull and the puppets barely move. My 9 month old twins will watch just about anything. But not this. :(
1,Not what I expected. Disappointing item,I didn't realize there is Japanese writing all over these pencils and there are no erasers attached either. A waste of money.
3,Somewhat useful,"Only gives about 25% of what you need for CLEP, i don't think it was worth it, but it is entertaining (for business law)"
3,kk5336,"First of all, it is not an Introduction to Weaving, but rather an introduction to the looms available. If you don't know what kind of looms are out there, than you might be interested in this DVD. It is an older production. I was originally going to buy the DVD on Rigid Heddle Looming, but it was suggested to purchase this one first. I'm sorry I did that. There are no instructions at all. If you don't know what kind of loom you want to purchase, then this DVD may help you out. It's like going to the ""auto show"" of looms. As I did know what loom I wanted and had purchased it already, I found this DVD of no use to me (and actually she was quite boring), I should have purchased the one I intended to, but after seeing this one, I'm hesitant on doing that since it is the same person."
1,Awful,"Unlike other reviewers who gave this Silverchair offering 1 star, I am not going to slate this album because its not the same as Frogstomp.It's natural for musicians to want to explore new directions as they mature. No one wants to listen to a bunch of 30-somethings whinging on about broken hearts and daddy-issues for the rest of their career... So, I would have welcomed this change in direction if Silverchair had done it well.However, Young Modern currently stands out in my mind as being one of the WOSRT albums I have ever heard. The songs are boring, the lyrics are bad, its over-produced and the whole thing seems really contrived... They seem to be trying far too hard to create their very own Sgt. Pepper, and I did not find the result at all enjoyable."
4,"Good for them, something different, but far cry from past","This is a good album on it's own, but almost soft rock/easy listening compared to first three albums. Diorama was a peak of potential, but this is by far the most comercial and polished I have ever heard this band. They don't have their angry young feeling anymore, and are hunkered down on just playing moderate rock and roll. It is almost as far of a departure as what Megadeth did with Risk, but I think silverchair pulled this off with a milder transition.This has a lot of synths on it, along with no real hard rock edge. Straight lines and Strange behavior are two better tracks, but this is still and album that i'm going to have to grow used to. Overall it is worthy of the four stars, because this album is just solid songs all the way through. These boys are growing up, but I hope they don't forget their roots."
1,This is not the silver chair I was expecting,I am used to the Silver chair that rocked. This new Silver chair is not at all what I want to listen too. I am so diappointed with the songs on this album. Not one rockin song like on their first album. I am glad I listened to it on here first before spending my money on it.
5,"""THIS IS NOT WHAT I'M USED TO!""","Silverchair has evolved. Some of their fans should try evolving too. If you can't understand the genius of at LEAST the first 5 songs on this album, then go find a new band to listen to, cause this isn't your band anymore and they've passed you by. Why are people SO INSISTENT that things stay the way they are??? Let's not take this too seriously folks, the band obviously doesn't, and I think that's what makes this album so amazingly brilliant! If you're not afraid of change, BUY THIS ALBUM! If you are, go listen to the same song, by different artists, played over and over again on your local rock station... Ohhh, fun!"
2,What happened to Silverchair!???,"I, by nature, am a very eclectic person. I love all kinds of music. I've played trumpet and french horn in an orchestra and also play guitar and have been in a few alternative/metal rock bands. That said, I was quite let down by Young Modern. I can respect some experimentation, as was the case with ""Neon Ballroom"" and ""Diorama"" and was quite impressed. But, there are 3 tracks on the whole ""Young Modern"" CD that I actually like. I've loved the chair since ""Tomorrow"" first came out and really like ""Neon Ballroom"" and ""Diorama"", but this latest CD doesn't even sound like Silverchair. Half the songs I can't even tell what Daniel and Chris are playing behing the orchestra and strings on most songs. I've always loved Daniels lyrics, but those just aren't enough to keep my interest in ""Young Modern"". I'm all for a band growing and changing, to a point. But this drastic change is just too much."
2,Not so good!,"My other Silver Chair CD is Frogstomp, bought about a decade ago. That album like this one relys on one good song to promote the album while the rest of the cd has subpar music. I wasn't too impressed with frogstomp due to it only had maybe two songs I liked, and I am not at all impressed with this one because it only has the one song I like being played on the radio. Listening too it twice over is enough for me to say I should have just download their hit and borrowed the cd later on to see if I liked it. If you liked Frogstomp, then you'll probably like this one."
2,Dissapointed All The Way - Too Bland For Me,"Yound Modern was quite a dissapointment for me. After the first listen, I thought I was listening to some other band and not Silverchair. The album sounds like the band took the ""lets just rock and see what happens"" approach. The songs are very simple, straightforward and I didnt get any emotion nor passion from the songs. Even the tracks with the orchestral arrangements are uninspired.Overall, their weakest album by a mile."
5,The Dissilverchairs,"With how much fun Daniel Johns had with The Dissociatives, and with the addition of Paul Mac to Silverchair, I definitely had a feel as to where Young Modern was headed (a highly anticipated sound in my eyes, I love the Dissociatives). This album was what I expected and sooo much more. What a treat. The band has once again taken another smooth musical turn.Original/creatively weird to say the least, there are so many sounds stylishly fused together -this album is musically brave in such a positive way. I was happy to hear that they kept the orchestration and arrangements (Van Dyke Parks) and added electronic sounds on top (Paul Mac). Those don't even make up for half of the pleasant surprises on this record.Once Diorama was finished, I really thought the band was going to have a difficult time making a more exciting follow up record. Well, they did it!! The world needs more fearless artists like Silverchair!"
3,Not Up to the expectations,Not a bad Album. The lyrics and the music just don't match the quality of the previous albums. I still miss the bitter guitars and the heavy drums.Good purchase although.
1,Silverchair? I doubt it.,"I admit that the album got better from beginning to end. Trouble is, it started out dreadful, abd didn't pass thru ""play me again"".It sounds like warmed over Crack The Sky, but more pop.Not sure where Silverchair went, but you do not want to go here with these people.rr"
1,SIlverchair is done,"I thought i would never be saying this, but silverchair is over, i have been a huge fan since they were the ""inocent criminals"". And i have to admit this album is really bad. The only bad album by silverchair.Do yourself a favor and save 25 bucks. Dont buy it!Daniel Johns is a great musician and composer, but for some reason this album is not beautiful like Diorama, its horrible, bad songs, feels forced.Go buy Diorama,FS,NB or frogstomp. Even the LP tomorrow. But dont buy this.!"
1,It's just such a sad thing,"I think most of the reviewers that gave this album a 1 or 2 rating got it right. I have been a HUGE Silverchair fan since day 1. I still listen to their first 3 albums almost religiously. Their ""Diorama"" release marked their downfall [even though everyone seems to think that Diorama is a classic].I love seeing a band change and evolve, but this is just not the case for Silverchair. If you're looking for brilliance in musical advancement, look at Radiohead or the Deftones.I mean, tell me they don't sound like the Wallflowers or The Sleepy Jackson with this album! It literally hurts to see a band that I had the utmost respect for move in such a dissapointing and pathetic direction."
3,The Queers - 'Beyond The Valley.....' (Hopeless),"Yet,another disc release by those fabulous(yeah,right)potty-mouth speaking guys in this long-running all American 'vicious' punk band.I've never seen this band play before and that's a shame because they've played my area numerous times before.Let's face up to the fact,that if there were an award for the most offensive CD of the month,The Queers would most likely win hands down.Some of the tunes here are actually likable,such as ""Strangle The Girl"",""In With The Out Crowd"" and ""I Wanna Know"".But,with tracks like,""I Just Called To Say F*** You"" and ""Just Say Cu**""(love it!)makes one think these guys are trying just THAT much harder to piss more and more people off.Is that real punk or what?Just might appeal to fans of Minor Threat,Ramones,Nerf Herder and maybe even Screeching Weasel."
5,Great Loppers,"These loppers are very nice quality. It cuts smaller branches with little effort. The larger size brances, (it claims to cut up to 1 1/2 inches), I do not have the strength to cut. But these really helped me."
4,Colin Firth makes a cookie into an eclair!,"I boughtHope Springsbecause I haven't yet found a Colin Firth film I didn't like, and I wasn't disappointed. I would rate it five stars, except that the script, some of the accompanying cast, and other ""filmological"" features don't match the quality of some other Firth films. If you're interested in a recent 5-star, try ""The Advocate"" or ""Love, Actually"". But the film was a very enjoyable experience on its own, and Firth takes an emotional cretin and makes him into an emotional genius during the course of the story, always a satisfying journey."
1,Hope Springs,"I have really enjoyed all of Colin Firth's movies, until this one. Very blah and did not seem to have a good story line. Thank You"
3,Hope Springs ok,"I was disappointed because I thought I was ordering The movie ""Hope Springs"" staring Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones."
1,This was the exception,"I very rarely do not finish watching a movie once started. This was the exception. The contrived affectations of the ""free spirit"" local girl were too painful to behold. I stopped the movie with a sigh of relief that I would no longer have to be tortured by her guzzling of alcohol (was that supposed to be cute? sexy?) and the rest of that awkward positively revolting scene. I could only feel sorry for the poor actors having to act such pure drivel. Big disappointment but I should have looked at more reviews rather than at the average of 3 stars and the belief that anything Colin Firth would appear in must be worth watching. Not."
1,I rented it for $$ so I sat through the whole dreadful thing.,"Colin Firth. Minnie Driver. Mary Steenburgen. Heather Graham. With a cast like that it has got to be entertaining, right? The answer is no. Even this lovely cast could not pull this awful movie up from the dregs. The story was slow and predictable. If you think you know the next thing that will happen, it will. There are no really sweet moments. There is nothing believable at all. No build up to anything. There is only one word to describe this movie: stupid. At least I feel as if my IQ has gone down several points watching this. I wish I hadn't paid money to rent it. I feel ripped off."
2,Disappointing...,"""Work with what you've got"" I guess was the mantra during this one. I really expected this to be better. (Colin Firth? Minnie Driver? Mary Steenburgen? Please.) It's never a good indication of ""good"" when I can stop a movie umpteen times and do whatever I just thought of because ""now seems like a good time."" What a shame. I wouldn't say this was a complete waste of time. It was interesting. Somewhat unbelievable, definitely, but interesting. And it got a little better as it went on. But not much. One very sweet 3 seconds and an actual moment warranting genuine laughter. I guess you can't expect everything to be stellar. This was quirky and a bit weird. But watch-able. If you're patient."
2,Hope Springs,"Love Colin Firth, and the story preview sounded interesting, which is why I bought this. Disappointed, though in the acting and plot."
3,An okay movie...,but not really a Colin Firth movie. A cute chick flick but could have been better. One mans quest to get over the woman who dumps him. The ending is VERY satisfying.
2,Bad bad bad movie,"Imagine you are trapped in the most boring day of your life, with Colin Firth and Minnie Driver and Heather Gram. This movie gives you a good idea what that day would be like. I got this because it looked good, but the story was pathetic. I couldn't under stand 1/2 the motivations for the characters. For instance, the night after meeting firth for the first time, Gram's character strips and jumps into bed with Firth. Um ok? Isn't Firth in Hope because of devistation over Driver? I guess men need only to go to the suburbs to find super easy women. Wow.Firth's character, if you can call it that, is so boring I couldn't imagine what any girl would see never mind 2 of them fighting over him.Stay clear of this clap trap."
1,Major Colin Fan,"How could Colin and Minnie been coereced to do such garbage?ß And to be cast along Heather graham (Boy, she really can't act!!) Such a dumb character. A pathetic attempt, if the director was aiming to come up with a british sort of comedy or whatever kind of comedy, it was not funny at all, just plain ridiculous!! Even Colin's gorgeousness and good acting could not make up for it.Colin Firth, please stop doing hollywood chick films, it lowers you, it ruins you!"
3,Colin Fan!!,"Yes, the movie was rather lame and disjointed, but seeing Colin Firth throughout the whole movie was worth it!! I have been crazy about Colin Firth ever since I saw Pride and Prejudice. Colin's role as Mr. Darcy definitely has more artisitic quality, but, hey, I watched Hope Springs for aesthetic reasons!! If you want to spend an hour and half watching an extremely handsome, witty man -- rent the movie!!"
4,Good story line,We're fond of Colin Firth and the story is great. However we would prefer that sexual content was not quite so visual.
3,surprise,A surprise movie when i was expecting to see Streep and Jones and still found this movie a nice story even with the English slang
1,Skip it,"This movie is very poorly written and the result is not distressing, just lame. The actors do their best but from very early on it is obvious that the material gives them nothing to work with. Fans of Colin Firth will experience a certain dim level of enjoyment. Minnie Driver is a treat but her character is no better written than the others. Vermont locations are worth something. With one or two moments of exception it's neither comedic nor romantic."
1,I didn't watch it.,"Be careful. I thought I had ordered ""Hope Springs"" with Meryl Streep. Same title. Well, my daugher did. Anyway, I didn't watch it so I can't review it."
2,Boring,"Bad movie. It really doesn't have a story. Too bad because I like Colin Firth he is great actor, not this one."
1,didn't understand this movie at all,"movie starts out with him having pangs of pain in a store making you think he has some terminal disease and 1/2 way through, having the blond get naked and in bed with this guy. no sense at all and even though i absolutely love Colin Firth, this sucked"
1,Stay away from this movie,"Do not waste your money in this movie. The story is flawless, there is no chemistry between the main characters and their acting is terrible. There are gaps in the story and the viewer just can not find any interest in any character main or secondary. Minnie Driver's acting is decent but she can not save the movie by her own."
1,Boring!,"This film was incredibly painful to watch. Boring, boring, boring. The storyline was ridiculous and the acting was contrived and terrible. What a waste!"
1,"Amazingly bad--- don't buy it, don't even rent it!","This film is unwatchable-- and the only question is what talented actors like Colin Firth and Minnie Driver are doing in this insipid hack job.When it comes to dialogue, not a single word rings true. None of the characters make any sense at all. They are reading lines and getting into situations that are so dull, and so ridiculously unbelievable, that one wonders if the film were written by a group of typing monkeys who happened to hit letters that formed words, rather than a cognizant human being.We couldn't get through it, as it was clearly outside the realm of possibility that the clueless writer-director could ever have his characters do anything that anyone else on the planet would care about. I see that view validated by the other reviewers with more persistence who watched this thing until the end.It's amazing he ever got funding for this ultimate turkey!"
1,Is this some kind of a joke? Romantic Comedy my foot!!,"My Gosh! the movie is bad - I mean really bad! The lead female role is someone you would want to run from. All through the film she jumps up and down like five year olds. She reminds me of the heroins of badly written, cheap romantic paperbacks. Ugh! And, what were those innocent - non-innocent clothes shedding?! She is an ideal example of ""how to loose a guy in 10 (read one) day"". The less said about the second lead - Minnie Driver the better.Colin Firth - I implore you to choose better next time - you are worth better."
4,Hope Springs,"I saw this movie when I was on a 11 hour plane trip and this was one of the only two things worth watching. I liked it a lot, it had many cute lines and I was able to watch it twice in a row. I don't know if it would be so good in a diferant setting, and clearly many people didn't like it, but I think that it's worth seeing. If it helps anyone I am female and 18 y/o."
2,Not great movie,It could be me but I was thinking I was going to watch the Hope Springs movie with Meryl Strep. At first I thought it was the introduction to movie I wanted but then found out it was the wrong movie with the same name. I think it's a bad idea to name 2 very different movies the same.
5,Captivating and tender romance,"Thrilling to the last minute with realisic and cultured dialogue, this is an excellent novel of sincere devotion."
2,The beginning of the end......,"This is definitely the album that puts this band on the downward spiral. Remember when bands like Obituary did 2 great album, but then by their 3rd it was clear it was over? This is the case with Exhumed. Basically, this band is now trying to take themselves ""serious"" as musicians and that's not the point of this style of metal. Also, getting some hyped up ""producer"" does nothing for this band. Whatever happened to death metal bands wanting to play raw, dark, and ugly sounding music? Like Autopsy, early-Carcass, Impetigo, etc.? Does Exhumed think they are impressing people with a clean and totally digital sound? I'm embarassed to have ever been a fan of this band after this atrocity. Latest on the band is that they now only have 1 original member left. That's another sign it's over for this band..."
1,...that was the day my dead pet returned,"Geez. I generally like - at least - one track on each Alice solo album. But, my God!, this one has no redeeming qualities whatsoever - zip, zilch. I have to admit that it is a unique album, but only in the same way Ed Wood makes ""unique"" movies. Upon listening to it, one must wonder what was going on in Alice's mind -- was his mind on how well he would play in his next golf match? It certainly wasn't on the music. If you're in any way masochistic, get this CD now and play it ""'til your eardrums bleed...""! Or, perhaps, there's that special enemy that deserves a little revenge? That works, as well. In 1973 on the album ""Billion Dollar Babies"", Alice sang of ""Sick Things"" -- he may have foreseen this album's release ten years later."
3,Alice Cooper - 'Zipper Catches Skin' (Warner Brothers),"Originally released in 1982,this was the follow-up to his 'Special Forces' effort(see my review).'Zipper...' is a rather 'off' the beaten path lp for Alice.That's not to say it doesn't have good songs,because it does.Tunes I thought were good were ""Zorro's Ascent""(it's got a great beat to it),the radio friendly ""I Like Girls""(with guest vocalist The Waitress's Patty Donahue-R.I.P.),""Tag,You're It"" and ""I'm Alive(That Was The Day My Dead Pet Returned to Save My Life)"".There's a cut here ""I Am The Future"" that at first I didn't remember where I've heard it before.Turns out it was part of the movie soundtrack for 'Class Of '84'.Line-up:Alice-vocals,Mike Pinera&Richard Wagner-guitars,Erik Scott-bass,Duane Hitchings-synthesizer and Jan Uvena-drums.Make not a classic,but decent."
1,Welcome to his nightmare,"I have a vynil copy of that album, and won't buy the CD, cause there are much better options to waste money! ""Zipper"" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the ""New wave"", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album ""Lace and whiskey"" and ""Zipper"" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. ""Zipper"" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of ""Love it to death"", ""School's out"" etc., but it's far from being on the same level."
1,The real Trash,"This is easily the stupidest and worst album that Alice Cooper would ever release, and that's against some real strong competition. Unless you're a 15 year-old there should be no way in hell that you'd hear this rubbish and like it."
2,Ouch,"I suppose this could be an enjoyable album...if you enjoy lousy, clueless shock-rock. ""Zipper Catches Skin"" is, along with ""Lace And Whiskey"", his poorest work. Alice appears to be going for humour again, and it fails on that level. The only even mildly amusing cut is 'Make That Money'. Such the-title-says-it-all tracks as 'No Baloney Homosapiens' and 'I'm Alive (That Was The Day My Dead Pet Returned To Save My Life)' will not make you laugh, at least not in the way Alice intended. There is the fine song 'I Am The Future' and a well- performed sendup of the slasher film genre 'Tag You're It', but nothing on this cd justifies buying it unless you're a Cooper diehard. For a far better look at his strange early '80's output try ""DaDa""."
2,Bloody Quirky Mess,"Alice was far too lost by this point to make a comeback record, and it shows. Aside from ""We Are The Future,"" there really isn't a decent song here. Since you can get ""Future"" on the Box Set, you can take a pass on this one."
5,Excellent Service,Remotes came within 2 days and programmed to garage opener with no issues. Absolutely will use this company in the future.
5,Works Great,"Easy to use. Click the garage door learn button, then the remote and your remote now works on your garage. Took me 5 seconds."
4,Good,This is an origninal OEM replacement remote and it worked first time with no problems. My only issue was finding the reset button on my opener whic was different to the ones listed on the instructions which came with the remote. but all went well in the end.
4,Worth the wait,"They took forever to get here, but these Liftmaster 371LM garage door remotes were new and exactly as described. Can't go wrong with these little workhorses."
4,Fully Operational Garage Door Remote.,"The Amazon price of this remote was the best I could get during my shop-around time. The product was sent to me quickly and I had it programed and working almost immediately upon receipt.Glad I got it from you guys!A.HernandezEl Paso, TX"
5,It works,"It works and it is a lot less expensive than the universal controls from hardware stores, which I cannot make work"
2,Returned,"Returned this item, as it was the wrong item I needed. Be sure you know the model # or the learn code button color of your unit before ordering a remote."
5,Easy and Fast,"Item arrived quickly.Setting it up was straightforward, easy, and well documented. It took about 45 seconds to do so. Have had no issues since, and that was two months ago."
5,Liftmaster remote,Excellent product that works on my Craftsman opener. The cross reference was very helpful and the programming was easy. Battery was included.
5,Liftmaster an easy fix,"Three cars and only 2 remotes for the garage door was making it a juggling act to get in and out of the house. Ordering this remote made our life easier in many ways. First, the remote was inexpensive. Second, the website for LiftMaster made it a snap to see which remote we needed. Third, the directions which came with the remote ensured an easy programming of the new remote and we had our opener responding within minutes. And finally, the product was shipped and at our door within days. I highly recommend this seller and the LiftMaster Garage Door Remote."
4,Great Experience!,"I lost my LiftMaster Remote Control while riding my motercycle. In need of a new controller, I turned to the web. Amazon.com provided the cheapest price and when I received the product to my surprise they were all new. The listing stated new and used controllers and a quanty of only four. At the low price I was able to buy all four. With the listing stating some being used, I was expecting at least one controller to be used. I had no trouble ordering, no confusion on shipping, and the controllers work great.In other words... Great experience."
5,Great Remote,"For those looking for a replace remote or just a secondary remote, this is a great remote. Easy to step-up. Please note this works with the garage door opener with the purple learn button."
3,It works,"Hey, it operates the garage door what more could you want. I bought a couple of these to replace my original units which have failed. The original units lasted three years, hope these new ones are better."
3,works but lacks range.,"Make sure the color coding on the door opener matches with one in the instructions. I accidentally ordered the wrong one and had to get it replaced. Getting this to set up is quick and easy and was done in a minute. The only thing that i didn't really like about this garage door remote was the lack of range. The other ones i have that came with the chamberlain garage door opener, I could be a house away and it would be able to open the door with a press of a button. With this remote i literally have to be in front mail box in order for the remote to be detected."
2,Easy to program but failed after 17 months,"The product was easy to set up and use and is lightweight. However, just a few months after the one year warranty expired, it quit working reliably. The battery still holds a great charge, but the remote fails to transmit most times due to a failure of one of the circuits."
5,very pleased,Ordered two garage door openers at half the price local companies want. they work perfect! Would order more if needed.
1,credit,This product was retuned unopen to the vendor about 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything back.Can someone tell me why
2,Had to return this,Wish there was more information with this product before I made the purchase. It did not work with my garage door. After the fact learned that it was not easy to return to the manufactor.
1,Aweful!!!,"This company and product is awful! Did not find out it only works with PURPLE learn codes until arrival, on the work order in very small font says ""Works with PURPLE learn code BUTTON ONLY !!""This means if your garage door motor does not have a PURPLE button, this will NOT work.Now there is a $5 ship back fee and another $5 restocking fee per remote. Save yourself the hassle, Do not buy!"
3,Watch the Shipping Charges,"The three Liftmaster 371 LM 315 HZ Garage Door Openers that I purchased worked as advertized. No problems with functionality. My problem is that I ordered three at one time and was charged the full shipping and handling charges for each one individually. They were shipped together in one box as one would expect. So the actual price including the shipping and handling was much higher than what I expected. I feel I was ripped off, although somewhat subtly."
1,NOT SATISFIED CUSTOMER,"I emailed and asked to confirm proper garage door openner. I purchase two that ended up being the wrong ones, they said that the color of the button on the unit mattered. I thought the serial # and other numbers would get me the correct unit only to find they want me to order again and pay in advance then refund my new remotes if they get them back in original condition with a 25% restocking fee. I would not use this company again until they make this right. I don't recommend them, find a company that offers a better return policy and faster response.Good luck.I went to HOME DEPOT and gladly spent $35 without the hassle and it worked fine."
1,Didn't work,"We followed the simple universal instructions. My Brother tried first, no good. My Mother then tried to set the garage door opener, no luck. Then I cam from inside the house, not seeing what they had previously done, checked the battery, opened closed the garage door, started from the beginning of the instructions. Still nothing happened.We tried with an existing remote that was working, followed the new remote's instructions. It worked perfectly for our old remote. #EpicFail"
5,Perfect,Bought a home with a two car garage but only one remote control. Other universal remotes in the stores were $30 and up. The is cheaper and actually the same brand as the garage door. I could not be happier with this perfect solution.
5,Chamberlain/Liftmaster garage door remote,"The garage door remotes work great, but you can't use more than eight on one door opener (per factory rep)."
5,theladypamela,"This was exactly what we needed in a second garage door opener. The price was great. I tried the local hardware store and they could order a 'compatible' one in for twice as much money. I am glad I went on Amazon, because we got a genuine product at a good price. I also tried buying it direct from Sears, and they wanted too much also."
1,Could not make this product work!! :(,"I spent almost an hour trying to make this remote work. I tried testing the battery, taking it apart and re-assembling it all to no avail. In the end I went to Sears and bought one that worked instantly."
1,Defective,"I received a defective opener. The only thing that works is the battery. Taking all things into consideration, I did not feel that it was worth returning."
3,Return policy is the horrible else good,I bought the LiftMaster 971LM buy mistake and can't return it because policy return is more expensive than buy this one (LiftMaster 371LM). Beside that everything is work as expected.I give 3 star because of the return policy.
1,worthless,I purchased 2 of these after I purchased a home with a liftmaster garage door. The batteries had only arabic instructions on them and they were not programmable to my american garage lift system.
1,Con Artists,"The sealer cent me the rouge item and to send it back for an exchange, I had to pay 25% restocking fee. I don't right reviews, but this mad me so mad! you are better off getting one at Home Depot or Lowe's"
1,Stingy and odd smell when open the remote box....,"I purchased the remote control from vendor name called: Sanford and Son? Services Incorporated . The remove control works fine however there is a Stingy and odd smell when open the remote box....The box appeared to be brand new but I am not sure what the smell was...anyway, I gave 1 star for the smell, and the remote controller like i said works just fine. my hubby programmed it with our garage opener with no issue...."
2,Didn't work,"This product will only work with ""liftmaster"" garage door motors. It seems like the designer could support interfacing with more than one type of device. That would be a much more robust and useful tool."
1,so simple a cave man could do it,"my remote arrived in the mail last week. i took out my stepladder, climbed up to the opener and programmed the remote as per the instructions. within 3 seconds or less, the remote was working like a charm. it doesn't get any easier than that."
1,"I only wanted to buy one, but three were orderedI","I only wanted to purchase one, but I checked other products. I could not figure out why the other two I only showed my interested without even given my final purchase request, but all showed up with my purchase even without my approval. Stephen Yu, 415-469-5469 (home), if not at home, try cell at 415-244-6215"
4,Item came and worked as expected,"I have tested this item recently, and very happy with its performance. To me, everything works smoothly, and both the product and service are great"
3,remote,the remotes work good but have weak batteries and need replacement. Should list that batteries may need to be replaced in ad.
5,"fast service, excellent product",i got the product in couple of day and set it in couple of minutes and it is working fine. Recommend the vendor.
5,can't complain,"Ordered two of em one for me and one for my wife, and they both open and close the garage. Great price too i got two on Amazon for the price of what i would have paid at Walmart for one"
5,Works great!,"With only one door, this price is great! Programmed my Craftsman opener easier than the originals. 2 seconds, done and working!"
1,Not much meat to this book.,"I was looking forward to receiving this book but was disappointed. It did not provide any more than a few visual cues on the artist's best known pieces. I had hoped for notes on his start, inspirations, and other less known pieces of artwork."
1,In 1989 I would have said this is a great book,If you are able to log on and see this via Amazon you are already too advanced for this book. I guess if I run out of bathroom tissue I may find a use for this book. Other then that it is a waste.
5,Excellent book covering the internet and PR,Specifically targeted at book PR but I found it very usefull as a general intro to the internet
2,Outdated information,"This book can be useful in some ways, but the information, contacts and so forth are badly out of date. Many of the contacts given in the book are non-existent now."
5,Phenomenal!,"This book is so ridiculously good, I barely know where to begin. If you have a web site to promote, this book offers advice and inside tips you simply cannot get anywhere else at any price. I've been in the web business since 1993 (http://www.e-media.com) and I've read (or skimmed) just about everything that's come out about business on the Internet and attended so many conferences as a speaker and attendee I've lost count. ""Publicity on the Internet"" is absolutely the most detailed, the most practical, the most real resource I've encountered in this field bar none. Even if you don't have a web site to promote and are just trying to get insight into what's really going on in the online world, I'd say this is the best introduction to the topic I've seen"
3,Paquito's weakest and least-interesting album.,"Since Paquito is one of my very favorite male vocalists, I bought this CD when it was reissued. Though his voice is very strong and clear, the choice of material and the production were mostly mediocre. The title track and ""Lirio Blanco"" are swinging salsa dance jams and the boleros ""Ciegamente"" and ""Cosas De La Vida"" are quite good but I found the other songs very disappointing."
5,"Old, Yet Curiously Refreshing","I love this book. When I was in the seminary, I was solemnly taught (from a plywood cathedra) that the New Testament was fundamentally unhistorical. The sugar on this bitter pill was that ""Jesus is the Lord of History, so what's the diff?"" Well, there's a big diff; and I was delighted to read Taylor's account of the earliest legends of the founders of the Church. His methods and his language are old-fashioned, but I think his instincts are right on target. I recommend that any serious student of Christianity take off his ""it really didn't happen that way"" spectacles and engage this book in good faith. In many particulars, Taylor has convinced me, and I daresay he may convince you too. His account makes the early Church snap into vivid focus, and though some details may be questioned, I doubt the edifice is unsound."
2,Combat Dodgers,"I have recently seen a comeback within calssic video games for the computer. Unfortunate for Snap! Classic Arcades collection, they make it where it costs really a little bit out of the ordinary for nostalgia. Their version of Atari's classic 2600 video game Combat, is a one on one battle of trying to dodge yor shot while manning planes, and tanks from the menacing bullets. All in all, the game is great for classic buffs, but is it really worth it in price, no. The graphics also have been remastered well, and the game is great, but there really isn't much variety here. Instead, I suggest you buy the Atari deluxe edition for the computer. You'll get well over 80 video games to choose from at a affordable price, including combat."
5,What magic lies between the covers of this book!,"I have thoroughly enjoyed reading these wonderful stories again, and it was a bonus having all of Rudyard Kipling's stories together in one volume. This book has all the Mowgli stories, plus other favourites like ""Riki-Tiki-Tav"", ""Toomai of the Elephants"", and many more. Reading these again affirmed my belief of Kipling's great skill as a storyteller. These stories had appeal for me when I was younger, but they have a different appeal for me now. Kipling's descriptions and characterizations are wonderful, and they put the reader right there in the jungle with Mowgli and Bagheera, and all Mowgli's other friends. We who love to read should not forget to read these wonderful stories once in awhile. Modern short story authors still have to go some to even begin to match these classics by a great author."
2,More tabasco please,"As a fan of Rebel Yell 1 it is with resigned disappointment that I accord this Sequel the two star rating befitting most any Sequel in any Genre. Because to my disappointment that is all Rebel Yell 2 amounts to. Outakes...leftovers. ""Let's take a good thing and see how far we can make it stretch"". To anybody interested in this subject matter I can only say buy the first book skip the sequel. And hold your breath together with me in hope that Jay Quinn takes a long enough breather for Rebel Yell 3 to be something FRESH."
4,mission immpossible 2,This music was the best. It had all the right lyrics and the best sounding music. I loved this soundtrack
4,Super Reader,"This is a novelisation type deal, based on a screenplay and information done for a movie of the same name.Here, Holmes and Watson meet at a fancy private school. So, of course, Holmes, while still brilliant, is not yet the supercompetent superdetective.One of the masters is murdered, and the boys have to look into it while dealing with school and that sort of lack of freedom."
2,should be sold at the 99 cent store,These are really cheaply made.After a while the glue holding the magnets on the bottoms starts to slip. Eventually the magnets simply fall off. We've also had a lot of issues with the lids getting stuck. You have to twist the lid in order to pour out the contents. Most of the time the lids get stuck and you cannot turn them at all. We've had to throw away a few of these because we actually had to crack them open because the lids refused to budge.They are neat but just know that they are extremely flimsy.
3,It is magnetic,Item was similar to expected. Magnetic surface held canister firmly to the stove refrigerater and enclosed steel strip that I mounted on the wall. The lids were a bit flimsier than expected with a light plastic rather than glass. The spouts work well and the prepackaged labels were that static cling material that you find with window decals. Tossed them as soon as we opened the package because they looked kind of tacky.
2,"Concept is great, execution is poor","When I first received these, I was delighted at their appearance and function. However, after time I've found that they just can't be used for all spices. Due to their inferior production, they are far from air tight. This then allows moister (humidity) to enter the containers causing powder-based spices to clump. Only herb-like spices work fine; my garlic and onion powders (for example) are hard balls and cannot be used. I'm very disappointed in this product."
3,I like these but . . .,The lids can be a little quirky with the shaker holes. You just have to be careful when you're finished using them to be sure the lid is properly in place. They do hold well on the magnetic strip.
4,Life Changing!,"Can I just tell you that this simple device has made my life so much easier... I can't believe I didn't find it sooner! I have 6 of these sets now on my fridge. Baking and cooking is alot easier because all I have to do is reach over and pull off the spices I need. No more digging through the cupboard, spice jars tummbeling off the shelves, or lost ingredients. One aspect of this that I like is that it holds a small sized spice jar (approx. 1/2 cup) and forces me to rotate and get fresher spices more regularly. For those spices that I use constantly, like garlic salt, I still buy the bulk containers, but store the bulk away and just refill as needed. The only complaint I have is that some of them have super tight fitting lids that are impossible to turn and sometimes stick when trying to pull off. Out of almost 40 spice containers, 3 are like that. I put my least used spices in those. To me, it's a small price to pay for such a handy item. LOVE THIS!"
2,Great Concept Poor Materials,"I actually loved my containers when I first received them. They are perfect for our kitchen and super functional. After the first 6 mos, I noticed the tins started to rust so I ordered another set as backup. Well now, I am in the same position again. Maybe a stainless steel would have been a better choice for materials. So I am going to try to order a stainless steel set from another manufacturer."
4,Nice little spice jars,They look great and have the option to sprinkle or poor. The only reason I didnt give them a 5 star is because I dont think they are airtight so moisture is getting in and making some of my spices clump together.
3,Not very usefull,The design is nice and conserves space. But its hard to get them out of the magnetic strip.
4,Perfectly Fine,"I received this item a few weeks ago and ... so far, so good. I've had none of the problems some of the other reviewers mention. I do think it's a bit overpriced and you might be able to make a similar home-made version of this item; you're basically paying for a very strong magnetic strip and cheap tins.The spices included in the package will vary, but it includes labels for many (but not all) common spices.It is kind of cool to look over at your spices and see the color, and the ""top of mind"" awareness of the display makes it easy to incorporate spices into everyday meals.My only regret is that I got a 6-spice product; I should have gotten a 12-spice rack or something otherwise bigger."
4,A Smooth Change,"Compared to the MOS Annual 2004, which was extremely vocal heavy and almost pop based, the Annual 2005 goes more into trance and dips into some break beat, but the good anthems are still here. Honestly the mixing job is amazing, the sound quality of course is superb and the songs can get any weekend started the right way. This has to be my favorite compilation to get ready to."
3,"Good album, but 2004 is better","Being a huge fan of the 2004 annual I had been looking forward to this album with extreme anticipation. That being said, I feel slightly disappointed, although this album is still a great effort by the two Australian DJ's. Unfortunately this year's selection of tracks just aren't as good, being more limited in the range of influences and generally slightly less sophisticated musically (and even a bit grating at times - and I usually like weird tracks!).Still quite a good album though, and one that I'm sure will grow on me a bit with further listening - but if I had to recommend a MOS annual to anyone, it would definitely be the 2004 one. And for variety, one can always go for MOS's Chillout albums."
4,Migraines,This book is short and to the point; very informative and makes sense. It seems apparent the author is well versed in the subject of migraines from a personal as well as a professional point of view. Recommend it.
4,Quick read,"This was a quick read to help with migraine treatment. I went through a rough bout of migraines where I thought I would lose my mind. I discovered that magnesium might help, but needed to know more information before I started taking the supplement. This book is a good resource for anyone who is planning to take the magnesium route. You can find a lot of the information online, but for a solid reference, this was a good book."
2,light weight but tinny- tunnel sound,"I liked the size and weight of the 700 and was satisfied with its sound quality although somewhat tinny sounding on my end, BUT, many of my clients complained about the reception on their end. Their complaints were that I sounded far away and very tinny. After a couple weeks of hearing complaints, I returned the 700, and purchased the Plantronics 510. Although the 510 is a larger headset, it is very comfortable for extended periods and fits better (feels more secure on my ear)than the Cardo Scala 700. I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end."
4,Among the best,"Better wind noise control than Jawbone, and Plantronics 510.Stays connected with Razer. Others don't.Background music a problem. Jawbone better when backgroung gets rough.The Boom best of all but so far no bluetooth. www.theboom.com.Bites ear after awhile.Good transmit and recieve audio. Almost as good as 510 in audio response.For less than $40---Good buy."
1,Poor Quality,"When I finally got the device paired, the small piece of plastic that wraps around the ear broke in half. So I had use of the headset for two weeks only. I am a very disappointed customer."
3,"Decent bluetooth, probably not worth the money anymore though!","When I got this it was my first bluetooth earpiece, and it worked well. My only complaint was the earpiece not really cooporating with my glasses. At the time they did make a hook attachment for it that would let you hang it from a glasses frame, but I never got it. Another consideration about the earpiece is this: do not leave it in a hot car. The rubber coating on mine turned to a sticky gel after one hot day. What a nasty, black mess!As an earpiece, however, it worked great!Why, though, do so many bluetooth earpieces not use standard USB connections? This one and the one I replaced it with both have proprietary connectors... So annoying."
3,Good serviceable unit,"Fine working unit. Paired just fine with the phone, and only had one issue with it. The earpiece would go dormant and needed to be 'awakened' by pushing the call button prior to picking up the phone. It could be worked around, but is something that needs to be looked into.Good battery life and good audio quality."
5,Great product,"I bought this headset and its incredible, very tiny ang light, the reception is fine, i recomend it!!"
4,scala 700,"This is a good headset. Lightweight, easy to use. One issue, when muting headset there is a tone that beeps to remind you that you are on mute. This tone drives me crazy. Other than the mute issue, I recommend."
3,Adequate Bluetooth,"Bluetooth is easy to use, clear, convenient and lightweight. Uncomfortable on my ear after long periods of use."
2,Disappointed w/the Cardo 700 BT Headset,"Alas, I did the research. I checked the reviews. I really thought this new version of Cardo's BT Headset would be terrific -- but it's not.It does fit in and around my ear ok and is comfortable. The controls are easy enough, and it matches up fine with my Motorola phone. But, the supposed top notch noise and wind canceling feature(s) is absolutely useless! If I'm sitting in a quiet room, it's pretty good. Get outside in any wind, or around crowds, or a busy city area and - to the other caller it sounds like I'm in a battlefield zone. It picks up every little noise and amplifies it. My suggestion -- keep searching..."
1,Cheaply made.,"I was so excited for this headset and after it finally arrived I was surprised by how cheap it felt in my hands. The buttons are not very responsive and the ear loop is a joke. You put the plastic ear loop through a hole in the headset and slide it up and down to adjust - no locking mechanism of any sort. The headset itself doesn't stay in place on the loop if any pressure is applied (ie: for adjusting volume) and I'm sure that after a while, the grip between the loop and it's hole will diminish and the headset will slide freely off the ear loop.I sent this headset back immediately after I opened it and realized what a piece of junk it is."
2,I am returning it,"I never even charged it and tried it, so I can't speak to it's sound quality or anything. The earpeice itself was flimsy and uncomfortable, so I returned it and ordered a different one."
2,I've had better ...,"Pros: Light weight and easy to use. Comfortable with glasses & sun glassesCons: Bought it becase of noise cancelation. Had to even turn the air conditioner off in the car while using it, don't even try it with the top down. I've had better quality with the Jabra that came with phone."
3,ok not great,"I just compared this with the motorola 700 and there were pluses and minuses. I am using mine with a LG 8300 and they are both ok so I dont know if the phone just has crappy bluetooth qualities. The sound is plently loud and the thing is comfortable enough to wear for long periods even though its a basically a paperclip on your ear. But there is always this constant hissing sound in my earpeiece I not sure if tthe other party hears it or not. It was def louder on the scala than the motorola, the motorola had clearer sound. On the flipside if I put my phone is the opposite pocket than the ear its on, the static almost makes the conversation impossible on both but there was less static on the scala, and the same goes for when I was walking around my room. Im not sure if its my phone or I just got a defective product, but i would reccomend trying it out at a store or making sure you can return it if it doesnt work without a restocking fee."
5,"Good reception, average connectivity","My main concern with buying a headset was clarity, both in transmitting and reception. The Scala 700 rates a 5 in both of these areas. However, I found that maintaining a continuous connection was a problem. I use a Treo 700w and found that I had to reconnect via bluetooth 3 or 4 times a day. The headset gives no indication that the connection has been lost and thus incoming calls would go directly to the phone piece and not the headset. I did like the comfort of the headset. Many times, I would forget I was wearing it. Originally, I thought the connectivity issue may be from my phone but I purchased a different headset and have had not connectivity issues. I've since given the Scala 700 to my wife and she is not having any connectivity issues, using a Moto Razor"
2,microphone volume is too low.,"this one is small, but the microphone volume is too low. When I called my friends, they all said that they hardly heard my voice."
4,scala 700,From the limited testing that I did the voice on the other end is clear and reasonably noise free. It works well with my motorola phone and the volume is good. Even works with the voice dial well.
4,pleased so far...,"I am very pleased so far with this device. a cost of $40.00 is a great bargain for a well performing bluetooth headset. It is lightweight and a real comfort to wear. One problem however is the swap feature. If you do not swap between two devices often (say once or twice an hour) the device has the potential to ""stick"" on one device only. You have to power down the headset and power up to ""unstick"" the device. This may be an isolated incident because of my devices. I currently use the headset for a Blackberry 7130e and a cingular 3125 smartphone. I have the issue mainly with the cingular device.All in all. I love it!"
2,Cheaply Made,"I bought this because the reviews were good. I have a KRAZR. It paired with minimal fuss, and I used it several times with good results, although it felt impossibly cheap (as if it would fly apart any moment just by using it). After two weeks (and using it three times), the volume control stuck on high. You could hold the headset at arms length and still hear the people speaking to you. Totally unacceptable. I've returned it.Borrowed my father's H500 Motorola and couldn't believe the difference in how well the Motorola was constructed vs. this - I thought perhaps all headsets were like this Cardo. Not so.Would not buy another Cardo headset due to the cheap construction (it reminded me of a dollar store toy)."
2,Other party can't hear,"There is not enough volume for either the called party or the caller, but it is especially bad for the called party. However, it does connect consistently in my experience and funtions properly."
1,disappointing sound quality,I bought this because of the noise-cancellation features. It's peformance is very disappointing. I have stopped using it in my car because of noise complaints on calls and gone back to my old Palm bluetooth headset. I could not recommend this headset except in very quiet environments.
4,Great Blue tooth Headset,I have been using bluetooth on my cell phones for nearly 6 years. I have tried and thrown out or lost at least 10 bluetooth headsets in the past 6 years. I am very happy to say that the Cardo Scala 700 is one I will try to hang on to. It has several capabilities that are critical to me:1-Great listening volume2-Very good voice quality for the people I speak with.3-Excellent battery life4-Very easy to use.5-Very comfortable.I use by blackberry 8700C and bluetooth headset as my primary office phone. I am on it 12- to 16 hours a day. The Scala 700 is the best blue toothheadset I have used to date. It is also one of the least expensive quality headsets on the market.I strongly recommend it.
4,My Observation,"The reception and the functionality of the Scala 700 Bluetooth Headset is quite good, taking into consideration the relatively low cost. The actual earpiece is a bit problematic in that it does not fit securely on your ear, however, it can be adjusted for a better fit. Overall, I am pleased with the headset."
5,The Best,Tried several motorola bluetooth and the Scale 500 and 700 out preforms them in every way. It has all the volumn you need and the person you are talking to can not tell that you on a bluetooth.
2,Decent budget headset,"I purchased one of these and kept it for two weeks.Pros: It works and has good call quality. The ear hook is adjustable, so you can form it to fit your ear, but...Cons: The adjustable ear hook is easily formable - put the headset in your pocket and when you take it out the ear hook has changed shape and now doesn't fit your ear so nicely. To turn it on and off (I saw a huge battery drain on my phone when it was constantly on), you need to press a button down for 3-5 sec. With my new headset, I just open or close the boom (Motorola 850)."
4,Best so far,"after reading all of the reviews on the Cardo Scala 700, I decided to purchase this item and it turned out to be just as the reviews stated. I gave it a 4 star only because of the static that so many mentioned in the reviews and I have experienced it. other than that, I love how it syncs so immediate, the volume is very loud, small and very easy to use the many functions. Great product!"
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this product with great expectations. Heres my review about it -- The ear loop is not comfortable , you can't wear it for more than 30 mins.- If you are planning to use it for voice activated calling( using Motorola Q or Verizon XV 6700 ). The voice activation over bluetooth does not work ( although phone supports it).- Most of the times you cannot receive calls ( according to user manual short press of contol button will receive a call ).But 4 out of 5 times it does not work.- Only thing I was able to do was to make calls consistently.- Call quality is not that great you will hear a staticky hiss on background.- I am not impressed with the wind guard technology.- Battrey life is very good."
1,cardo 700 review,the product does not work with the Treo 700 phone. I have friends with the Treo 650 that use the Cardo 500 model and it works fine. I actually borrowed someones Cardo 500 and it works withmy Treo 700 just fine. Can you help me with this problem?
5,Just really good.,"So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had. Simple, lightweight and great fit. Heard great things about battery life, but I've only had it for about two hours so far!"
1,"Two units, both DOA","First unit would not charge or turn on, unless plugged in. Same problem with the replacement. Even if I got a functioning one now, I'd wonder how long can it possibly be good for.I've had a SCALA 500 for about 4 years, and it's been just about perfect. I recently dropped it, and the speaker cover and one of the wires have come off, but now I'll be soldering it back together - even after a few weeks of sitting in my ""dead electronics"" drawer, it is still charged, and works well when the contact is held closed."
3,Six weeks and still waiting!,"Originally ordered this item in late July. First one shipped was defective (wouldn't take a charge). Returned for replacement, which wasn't sent until shipper received defective item back. Second item was also defective - same problem. I requested prepaid shipping and asked that a replacement be sent right away. The initial shipping charge was refunded, but it's ten days later and I still don't have the item.Can't evaluate the product yet, but getting a hold of it has been a nightmare!"
1,Too Delicate-Fell apart in 2 weeks,"If you have ever dropped your cell phone, this isn't the product for you. I dropped the earpiece once and it completely fell apart. I emailed customer service and they never responded. Instead purchase the Platronics earpiece because it sounds great and is sturdy."
2,Depends on you,"The sound quality of this headset is pretty good. It looks and feels very poorly made, almost like if you drop it it would just break which is not a very reasurring quality that you would want in a headset. Personally when i get a headset I would rather not a have a little plastic piece that i put in the blue tooth and then around my ear.the main reason i wanted to return it was that it hurt my ear and did not fit right at all. My friend put it in his ear and had no problems it depends on if you happen to have a larger ear and don't care about the filmsy problem then its very well priced and go for it, if you have small ears like me and my mother (who also bought one and returned it because it just has no padding and is sharp and hurts), then i would not recommend this headset."
1,great price and fast delivery but poor quality,"I had one of these prior to this purchase and it worked great. I dropped that one down 2 flights of stairs so I made this purchase. The second one is terrible! Static at any/every range - I couldn't hear anything but static. I hope this is a ""freak thing"" for Cardo but my experience is 50/50 and those are not good enough odds to make another Cardo purchase."
3,"My first Bluetooth headset, but not impressed","I bught one of these, and the tiny plastic earpiece broke the first time I tried to adjust it. I sent it back and received a new one. I am not sure why so many people complain that it is uncomfortable, I barely even notice it is there. It also paired pretty quickly and easily with my LG VX 8500 (Chocolate phone). The sound quality on my end is very good, but some people I have called complain of an echo on their end and it picks up a lot of ambient noise. I have not tried pairing with multiple phones, using it in a windy environment, or using the feature to find it when it is lost. I did try the voice command dialing, and it works intermittently. I cannot say that I am very impressed with this headset, although it is convenient, I would definitely not buy another one."
2,Not all it is cracked up to be,"I was excited about this new Scala 700 because I had like my 500 so much. The 700 had the potential to connect to multiple devices so it would make changing from one BT device to another simple.The good news is that it does support multiple devices flawlessly.The bad news is that it picks up background noise worse than any other BT headset I have every used. The slightest wind, road noise, airport noise, etc caused the caller on the other end want to end the call until I was in a quiet place. It is also not comfortable with some of its sharp edges. Totally unacceptable in my opinion."
3,Pretty good head set,"PROS: Small compact, light weight, multiple functions, easy to use and decent sound quality.CONS: feels a bit flimsy and needs a better ear loop.OVERALL: Okay headset for $25."
3,Some features don't work,"I bought this for the ""find me"" feature. It didn't work. Wrote the company. Never heard from them."
4,I use it with my 2 cellphones,"This product is great. The biggest issue with it is the earloop. I`ve had to change it twice in 5 months and it keeps breaking up. Other than that this headset is great. The battery autonomy, the sound quality and the fact that it can be used with 2 phones and you can easily switch between phones is more than great."
2,disappointed after doing the research,"I actually read a couple reviews before buying that spoke quite highly of this headset. At first the ill-fitting earpiece wasn't enough to dampen my spirits, because I thought it supposedly had great ""noise cancelling"" technology. Then I continued to have friends and family tell me how rare that great sound was from their perspective."
4,Excellent For The Money,"I bought the Cardo Scala 700 initially for my 16 yr old son. It was so good out of the box that I have bought a second one now for myself. Its great for driving down the road and it pairs well with a Sanyo Katana DLX and a Sanyo M1.It does well until the surrounding environment becomes extremely noisy or windy. But in all other common environments its great. People when asked, say it sounds as good or better on their end, as my cellphone itself does; and I can hear others just as well. Response to all voice commands is great! I can check and navigate through my voicemail without a hitch.I have very carefully researched headsets for a few weeks before deciding on this purchase and I strongly recommend it - if you want something on the budget end. If you want something that is truly creme de la creme and willing to pay for it; then you need to get the Aliph Jawbone. These are the only two headsets to get on the market at the moment."
2,Quality not up to snuff,"While this product was easy to sync up, my first minute of conversation with it contained a lot of 'what?' for the other party. I actually returned it and will continue with my wired ear piece."
2,Just average,I bought it because of the great reviews it had. It actually is not that great. It is not that loud and i still can not get it to stay in my ear right. I had a scala 500 but lost it. I would rather have it instead of the 700.
2,Poorly designed,"The electronics part of this product work great. The design of the ear piece is terrible, as if it was an after thought. 90% of people will not like the way this product fits on their ear."
2,Overall...Poor,"The part that goes into your ear is waay too big to fit comfortably in any reasonable person's ear. I'm a 6'1"", 200lb guy, and I don't think of my ear's as abnormally small in proportion to my body, so that should tell you something.Also, any time that your phone is not 3 feet in line-of-sight from the phone, it starts getting interference with weak sound and buzz.Moreover, it is very hard to get it to fit in your ear with the way the earpiece works."
2,I expected better,"Disappointed with this headset, although I have tried just as bad or worse. Based on others' reviews for Treo 700, I tried it and do not like that there is almost constant static on the headset, and the bluetooth range is significantly less than 10 feet. People tell me it is like listening to me through a tunnel; sound quality is pretty bad most of the time. The great feature about it is the finding it feature, which worked for me immediately and quite well. All headsets should have this feature as a standard. This is not enough for me to keep it; I am returning it."
3,LeapPad,For little kids this may not be the best toy.Five year olds are the ones who want to read.Four and three year olds want to have fun but not by learning when other kids are outside exploring.When they are in Kindergarden they will want to know more so they can show the teacher how much they know.All I can say about the education of this toy five stars since it is full of learning how to read.About the durability you could say on the line of three and four because the kids are repeating they might not get the word the first time so they want to listen to it over and over again and it might scrach the tape and it will make a stammering noise.why I chose four is because the rest of this toy seems nice and sturdy. ...
2,It did not engage my 5 year-old,"Dispite the excellent reviews of this toy (which I gave my son for Christmas), it did not raise the slightest bit of interest from my son. Once I received the Leap Pad and saw his reaction to it, I figured out why. Essentially, this toy does the same thing as any number of learning-oriented CD-Roms such as Reader Rabbit, etc. However, it is ultimately a lot les interactive and exciting than the computer. Therein lies my son's lack of interest. Compared to the computer, the Leap Pad is clunky and less fun to use. Maybe I'll take it with us on vacation and see if it interests him once we're away from the computer, but if you have a computer at home and your child has some reading oriented CD-Roms, I'd save my money on this and buy another toy instead."
3,Maybe we got a bad one,"We got my first leap pad for our daughter at age three. We really liked it, but the pen didn't work for very long,it's not detached or anything, it simply doesn't work when applied to the page.It also doesn't recognize the cartridges sometimes. It was pretty frustrating, as I have quite a few books that she was unable to use. I was thinking of getting the next leap pad, but I am a tad skeptical, and am now looking into other products along the same lines."
1,What a piece of JUNK,"I rated this item a 1 because that is the lowest rating available. It should be ZERO. I bought the LeapPad for my grandson and could never get it to work properly. When I could get it to turn on all it would do is throw out words a random and make a krackaling sound when we moved the pen. After changing the batterys and cleaning the contacts with alcohol as sugested in the instructions it worked for about a minute, reading half a page then jumping back to the start instructions. At the price (I spent almost $100.00 on the pad and extra books) they charge for this item this is uncalled for. VERY DISAPOINTED after reading the reviews of others. This piece of crap is going back to the store in the morning!!I had a very sad little boy on his 4th birthday.DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!"
1,Learning,"Purchase this product and your child can learn to read without Parents. Thats right, give this to your child and then you can no longer be apart of their childhood memories. Buy a book from Amazon and read it to your kids at night, during the day, on your lunch break.....read together. LeapFrog is creating new ways to isolate the child and create a lonely environment with an animated voice. Don't buy this with the notion your child will pronouce their words better, or make reading fun. You make reading fun, the parents. Its just a fancy toy not a tool."
2,Toooo sloooowww for my boy,"My boy has the attention span of a 4 year old. Why? Because he is 4 years old. He has no patience for the slow pace of age-appropriate leap pad materials. The learning games are too short, too slow, and too repetitive for him."
2,Yuck. Please. Buy some books instead.,"Played with this at a neighbor's house. The ads promote it as portable...please! It weighs three pounds! It's uncomfortable to have on your lap. It can only ""read"" a few select stories, unlike the million-and-one stories an actual live human can read to a child. As for ""teaching at the child's pace,"" that's something a good teacher will do, at school (or home-school) when the child is developmentally ready. Where will this glitzy toy be in a few years? In a cardboard box, in the basement. Buy a nice copy of Good-Night Moon; that'll still be around for your grandkids.As for the [money] you'll spend...well, a library card is free. Cuddle the little one on your lap, and read, and read, and read!"
2,How do I rate the service,"My dauther loves Leappad toys. They no longer sale Leap Pad Learning system so I bought it via you. When the toy came, it was on a box without any pacaking to protect the toy. Also it was dirty( had brown stain on it, so I had to clean it before using. After three and half week of use it started to have problem with the sound. We change the batteries but it is still acting up. This is the first time I had problems with Leappad products. I would never buy any futere product from this vender?saler. Very dissapointed"
2,A great education in ... frustration!,"We will not buy any more Leap products unless they improve their products and their treatment of customers. My kids love the my first leap pads and the regular leap pad and want the new Leapster but I refuse to invest more money. We only allow these pads to be used while sitting next to an adult on the sofa, but we've still encountered numerous problems with the pen/stylus, cartridges ""wearing"" out, etc. The company doesn't want to fix or replace anything so you're stuck with whatever you spent. I would love to see a system that uses mini discs or some other data source that doesn't stick out of the system and uses complete touch screen or game pad technology. Since nothing else really has the great educational software, we'll be sticking to the computer and getting a game boy for entertainment."
4,"great concept, not-so-great design","My 4 year old loves his leap pad, and I really appreciate its educational value. That said, the huge problem is durabilty.As others have mentioned, the pages are spiral bound and thin. They rip very easily. My 2 year old has destroyed 3 of her brother's books already.The pen is also a problem. My son, unfortunately, chews on it, but even if he didn't, the position of the pen when not in use causes the wires to crimp and short eventually. Replacements are available only directly through Leap Frog customer service, which is a hassle, but they are relatively inexpensive and my experience getting replacements has been excellent."
3,A Great Idea For Kids Who Want To Read By Themselves,"It is a great idea, however, there is a downside.The one down side that I saw immediately was the quality of the speaker. It is poor.The real benefit of this toy is its ability to interact and ""talk"" to the child. A bad quality speaker makes that difficult to impossible. Any voice with an accent or variation in tone can make it very difficult to understand.My suggestion to the buyer is that you get a set of earphones with the Leap Pad. I recently went out a bought a pair and have noticed a big difference.My suggestion to Leap Frog is that they install a better quality speaker and offer earphones as an option with the standard edition, but include a decent pair in the deluxe edition.That's my two cents."
3,"Parents like, but kids...another story","My cousin had one so my 4 year old daughter, who is two years younger, had to have one too. For months, whenever we passed one in the store my daughter wanted to play with the leap pad, so naturally we got her one for Christmas 2003, along with several book and the carrying case. My daughter played with it at home for about one month and then was soon bored with it. She loves books but she was very frustrated with the cartridges and the malfunctioning of the toy. New batteries trend to work, but there was no turning back. Its now collecting dust. Every now and then when we are going for a long drive, i make her take it with us, but she prefers, pen and paper so she puts it in the carrying case. My aunt recently told me the same thing with her daughter, loved it until they brought it home."
4,Lovin' It!,"We bought Leap Pad for our daughter last Christmas right before she turned 2. She loved it from the word go. At the beginning we had to sit with her while she played and got used to the stylus, as shes gotten older she's become a little more independent. Now as she's approaching her 3rd birthday she's asking for more books. She loves the puzzles, and is good at them too. She enjoys learning her letters and what they sound like. Even the book that came with the Leap Pad is pretty cool.I highly reccomend this to anyone."
4,Great for my son with Autism,"My sons have autism, this product is conducive to their learning to read fluently. The only down side is that the stylus is sensitive."
2,Dumb Down,"Just know if you buy this that if the game cartridge reads 6 to 9 yearsit should really read 3 to 5 years. My 7 year old found them in her own words to be to "" to babyish "" I would say she is an average 7 year old child. Games and pad 200 dollars wasted. Not for kids over 5.Also customer is worse than a joke."
2,Great product but major quality overhaul required,"I have now purchased three separate models. My 5 yr old son absolutely adores this toy. He calls it his ""Computer"" and I was really impressed that he began playing the spelling/decoding game and actually learning how to spell. After a month of the first one, the product failed to turn on. We bought new batteries, followed the trouble shooting directions to no avail. So, we ordered a new model. This one didn't even work the first time we tried to turn it on. We sent that one back and ordered another one. Again, product failed to work on start up. It's a real shame. I would have given this 5 stars if only I thought I could count on the thing to actually work!"
5,GREAT PURCHASE,"I bought a leap pad for my son, now 4, and he loves it. My 3 year old daughter is getting her own this Christmas because she uses her brother's a lot. She is learning the 50 states now and I am relearning with her. There are a lot of things to do in all the pages. I like that they have many different books. The only thing I didn't like is the paper pages. My 1 year old has gotten ahold of one of the books and ripped it. My son was so disappointed that I am buying him a new book. I highly recommend this to anyone with young children."
3,Some problems for my left handed son,"My six year old enjoys his, but is somewhat frustrated by the pen and cord layout. It is clearly designed to better facilitate a right handed user. I am right handed, but tried using it with my left hand, and the cord was always getting in the way. It is also difficult to close without the cord getting in the way. I suspect this will cause some wear and tear on the cord in time."
5,excellent and educational,"My 3 year old loves this. She is still a bit young for the reading part of it, but really enjoys the ""games"", which help her learn.We used it on the airplane for our trip to Europe and it really kept her occupied. The great thing is you can plug in headsets and that way, it makes it a ""quiet"" toy.I just don't like how the pen goes back in the pad...it gets crimped in there, and it's not easy for a child to put back in place. It looks like they've solved that problem with the new leap pad plus writing... I just wish they had thought of that earlier when they made this product."
5,much loved but quickly broken,I found out what was wrong with the Leappad after writing to Leapfrog online. The pen was broken. I have since replaced the pen twice. This current pen has been in place for the last 12 months. Perhaps it will last. Leapfrog will replace it for you for free if you send the defective pen back.
3,Leap Pad - the Whole Series,"My children and I were rather disappointed in our LeapPad. It was received for Christmas with 5 books.While they made it through New Years, shortly after, they bagan to misread whole pages, paragraphs, --and just pieces, here and there.We changed pins, etc., but it seems the cartridges didn't hold up well for a toy of this price.In order to replace cartridges, one must buy the whole new book.Manufacturer was no help."
3,Very nice but he got bored with it..,This is a very good educational toy but my little one got boredc with it. Maybe when I can afford more books he'll be interested again..The books are a little too expensive for my liking..I don't let him play with it unattended.. He is tough on toys and I don't want it broken. I don't feel it is built tough enough.
4,Does not last,The idea and concept behind this toy is great but the craftmanship is very poor. My son had his for four months before it quit working ..... we have tried everything and the device just does not work. We are very disappointed in this item and cannot recommend it due to the poor quality.
4,The ultimate road trip necessity!,"I bought this for my son when he was 3yrs old. He loves it! He changes the cartridges and matches them with the correct color books! At 3 he was learning the states and their capitols as well as the different bones and parts in/of the human body! I keep it in the car because anywhere we drive it is a lengthy distance and keeps him entertained. I also purchased the backpack for the leap pad that holds up to 4+ cartridges and books as well as the leap pad itself! It aids in eye hand coordination, color and number recognition as well as geography and the human body! It really is a wonderful product. I give it a mom's 2 thumbs up! :)"
3,Great educational toy BUT...,breaks easily. Six months and the pen breaks and that's with very little use. After reading other reviews and noticing others with the same problems I can't understand why the company doesn't fix the problem but I do understand why it only has a three month warranty. My advice for those wanting to buy this is to try to get it used with books (another major expense at [$$$] per book).
3,"A gret idea, however ours didn't work right","My dau got this for her 3rd b-day. She loves books & often ""reads "" them to her 1 yr old brother since she knows the story. The problem with the Leap Pad was that unless you click a certain spot the book reads the wrong page & instead of reinforcing learning it is actually teaching incorrect words & phrases. I was very dissappointed since this is not an inexpensive toy, esp when you buy several books, the backpack, etc.. It also eats batteries. If I had it to do over again, I would not have bought this toy. I gave it high educational value since it could have been a great toy to learn with."
5,Best Educational Toy Ever Made!!,"My 3 year old daughter received the Leap Pad for Christmas and has enjoyed it every day. We asked each family member to get a book for it since they are a bit pricey. I would say this is the best investment we have ever made. The LeapPad seems to make a child want to learn. We also gave our 23 month old the My First Leap Pad for Christmas because she was having a problem concentrating on her ABC's, but now she is taking more of an interest in learning since we got her the pad."
5,Endless fun,"I'm not a fan of automated or battery operated games, but I have to admit this one is worth every penny. My son immediately fell in love with it. It's good educational fun, which keeps your child challenged."
4,Good Stuff!,"The LeapPad is wonderfully simple to use --our four year-old took to it immediately and required very little help. Haven't had it long enough to really speak to durability or how long batteries last, but the unit seems solid. My only area of concern is the cord that attaches the pen... I could see it not outlasting the rest of the unit."
1,What about the PEN!,Ths was a great toy. I purchased it when my daughter was 3 years old. It lasted for about 6 months before the pen stopped working regularly. Now we have about 100 dollars worth of game books. What a waste of money that was! Too bad they didn't have the finger touch one back then! I won't buy another leap product.
4,This is a really great toy if your child hates to learn,"My children Ceejai, Rajiv, and Deepa all were at one point at the bottom of their class. The teachers had so many children to take care of, they couldn't give a lot of attention to my children. Ceejai, Rajiv, and Deepa all hated to learn because they thought it was hard and they knew they wouldn't get it. Rajiv, now in 3rd grade, brought his test grades from 40's to 90's in 3 weeks. Because the Leap Pad makes learning almost concealed in the fun and excitment it brings, kids forget it's educational. Ceejai, in Pre-K, will be reciving her's this year on her birthday and Deepa, in 1st grade, is still asking me every 15 or 20 minutes to ""Pleazzzze Mamma put in my book so I can read again"" everytime she finishes a book. The best part is, you can grow with this. From Pre-K to 3rd grade, and still going strong, this toy is a keeper!"
5,Multi-subject Interactive Learning Book,"Excellent learning tool. Various subjects motivate reading,music, listening skills and more. My four year old can't put it down.Additional books are unavailable anywhere until spring. We want the ""Pooh"" book."
2,watch what cartridge packs you buy.....,"I purchased the leappad learning system online and purchased the suggested packages to go along. Not realizing that they do not work w/ my daughters system. They are for the ""my first leap pad"" system. Selling online for $145.00. You have to really watch what is suggested by amazon on the toys you sell. What is suggested does not always work. At christmas time, it is hard to know what works and what does not sometimes. I recommend they add model numbers to thier items to know what will work with what, not just the name."
4,"Fun, educational, can really pull you in buying modules","The Leappad is a fun educational toy. The child touches various things on the book with a pointer, and the toy reads the position of the pointer to respond appropriately. Sometimes, in the book aimed at a younger child which we have, the book will make music just to make music. It seems odd at times. I don't think the LeapPad alone will teach your child everything he needs to know, but accompanied by everything else it can make a contribution. It's pretty durable, towing the LeapPad around by the pointer hasn't broken it yet, though we try to discourage that activity."
3,Stock up on batteries,"Our daughter enjoys this toy. However, we could afford the Leappad but not the constant changing of batteries. It would be so much better if it had the capabilities to be plugged in. During the first two weeks we had this toy, we used more than 20 batteries. It was used a moderate amount and we supervised to make sure it was turned off properly each time. Our daughter became frustrated because it seemed to need batteries every other day and we didn't always have the batteries on hand. It's too bad because otherwise it's a great toy. It's just too high maintenance for the parents."
3,The batteries don't last!!,The stories are sometimes pretty lame and the batteries don't last even through lightest use.
4,Would Not Buy,"If you wear out the pen on this toy it will not work. I just put new batteries in it today and it doesn't read the right book, it's worthless now for my 6 year old. If it worked right it would be great, but can't figure out what keeps happening to our leapfrog products none of them work right after a year and this toy wasn't used enough to be broken....Don't recommend purchasing leapfrog items...."
3,"good product, poor durability","We have had the same problem with the Leap Pad as another recent reviewer: after a few months, the pen no longer activates the &quot;magic&quot; circles in the books, rendering the entire leap pad useless. We don't know where to get a replacement part. Very disappointing, especially considering the cost and the fact that the Leap Pad people should have constructed the device to withstand children's play (in this regard, we have seen no evidence that our 3 year old girl has tugged at the pen wire or otherwise manipulated it roughly)."
5,BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT!!!,"[...] Okay.... I bought Leap Frog and took a major chance, because it cost me [$$$], and I usually don't go that expensive on gifts. I gave it to my 5 year old for Christmas. Not only did she play with it, my 7 year old loved it, and my 9 year old went nuts over it. So now we have 2 Leap pads and a Quantum Leap!! It was the BEST money I have EVER spent!!!!"
5,A great toy!,"Although a little pricy, it is well worth the money. My son has had his for a year now (he is 5 now) and he loves it. It is very educational and keeps him interested for hours. He has added a few new leap pad books and enjoys every one of them. He even asked for a new book from ""Santa"" this year. There is so much room for him to grow into it since they make books for it for when he is older. I think it is a great toy as well as very educational."
3,replacement pen,"Can I really replace the pen on the leap pad? My daughters leappad is not working correctly. She points to a word and it reads something else, sometimes it just shuts off on it own. I'm not sure if its just the pen or the pad itself. I even changed the batteries? Where can I buy a replacment pen? or should I throw it out and buy another one? My daughter really learned alot with this toy, but it didn't last long because she loaned it to other kids. I suggest that younger kids should be supervised with this toy so it could last longer."
4,Pleased Parents,"We purchased this for our son who was 6 at the time and he loved it. He loves playing the games and even had the entire family playing with it. We have found it very educational and many books to choose from. He is always wanting more books. The younger kids like to play with it and it's not very difficult for them to follow along. We will get more LeapPad products, they are really great."
5,"Way Fun, Even For Adults!",This is a great product! Fun for kids of all ages. My little niece recieved one for x-mas and everyone enjoyed playing with it including her grandparents. It is very educational and fun! I would recommend it totally. It gets an A++++++ from me.
2,"My son loved it, but it won't always work...","We originally bought this for our son several years ago when he was three years old. He loved the interactive nature of the toy and played with it a lot for the first few months. Then we noticed the unit would not recognize the cartridge as a leappad cartridge. The unit would turn off on its own. The pen was defective, and the replacement pen was also defective. The paper books need to be a lot more sturdy. Too bad. My son loved the toy. If it would just work."
4,Worth the Money,"The Leap Pad is a great gift for a variety of ages. You can buy books at different age, interests, and ability levels, so a child won't outgrow this toy. It's very portable and handy to take in the car. If they use headphones, no one but the child will hear the Leap Pad's sounds...I think the Leap Pad is worth the money."
4,Loves it,"I got this for my daughter when she was 3 years old. It's all she talked about so we finally got it for her. She loves it. She's 4 now and she still plays with it. As far as the books go, they are all ok but you don't have to stick to the age limits. My daughter is very interested in maps so we got the geography book that is for older kids. It's one of her favorites and she has learned quite a bit from it. The only tricky part about the system was getting her to remember to touch the ""go"" button on each page to start. The other drawback is each book has a cartridge to go with it. Keeping up with the cartridges has been a pain."
5,My 4 year old loves it,"I like this product for all of the reasons given in the other reviews, but just wanted to add one more if it's helpful. We have to our surprise found the Leapad to be a great alternative to home computer games for our four year old.My four year old calls this her ""computer"" and we find it has several advantages over her software games: (1) she can turn it on, off and use it by herself; (2) it doesn't wear on her eyesight the way staring at a monitor would, and (3) it's portable.If you are trying to decide between investing in a computer for your child or getting the Leapad, I recommend trying this first!"
2,My children are not interested,Neither one of my kids show much interest in this. They both love books and one is starting to read. It is a pretty expensive item if your not certain your children will use it.I attempted three times to show them how it works and they lost interest quickly.
5,**Perfect,I purchased this toy for my 2 year toddler & it was fun for him to hold the pen to heard to different sounds coming the the bright illustrated pictures. Now he's 3 yrs old and now he's interest in repeating the words as he listens to the story. Perfect for bedtime reading.
3,Pushing agenda,"Both my kids (ages 4 and 3) enjoy playing with this. It's a great electronic toy, but the book that is included with the system, which is a sample of various subjects, opened my eyes as far as the science aspect goes. The Leap Pad company treats evolution as a proven science and says that dolphins' ancestors once had legs. This is not a proven fact.Also, the pages do rip easily, as other reviewers have stated. I will continue buying books for this system, but will most definitely stay away from the science subject."
2,Caution! Boring story!,"The concept of Leap Pad is wonderful. I like the interactive nature of the reading, where the child can control pace and focus. BUT the STORY is BORING and very strange, language-wise. Because the writer has limited herself to a very controlled vocabulary selection, using only limited vowel combinations, the language sounds very contrived. For example, instead of saying ""My tooth is loose,"" the story says, ""it TIPS""! Whoever talks about a tooth TIPPING? Given that the child can listen to the story over and over again, controlling the vocabulary that way isn't necessary."
1,Never got past putting batteries in!,"After the second Leap Pad I've purchased (the previous one I had to return to the store yesterday) that is broken and doesn't work, I've decided that this is NOT the toy for my child. We didn't even get past putting the batteries in!The first one's battery compartment screw and bolt were broken, so the compartment wouldn't stay closed. Hence, I took that one back yesterday and exchanged it for another. The second one worked okay for about five minutes after I turned it on for the first time, but the second time I tried turning on the machine, it wouldn't work, no matter what I tried. BACK TO THE STORE with this one, too! Very frustrating!! Would've been a wonderful toy for my child, who loves books and would've been delighted with one that is interactive. But I cannot imagine that a toy that's this unstable would last for very long with a small child.I'm on the lookout for something similar, but certainly from a different manufacturer..."
2,Sad,"My son loved his LeapPad. When it conked out for the second time we decided to purchase another one, thinking the first two times were a fluke. Just because he chewed the cord on the first one, and the second one just went haywire. Well, we hadn't had the third one for more than one week and it started to act up. So now his LeapPad doesn't work anymore. What a waste of money! And it's just so sad for my son. We have all kinds of games for it that are just going to sit in his closet and take up room. I didn't want to believe the previous reviews, but I can't deny them now! When it did work, it was fantastic! My son could be on it for hours and he did absorb the things that the LeapPad was teaching. Plus it's done in a fun, interactive way. So I rated it fairly high for the educational and fun values, and quite low for the durability. Overall, it's not a great product."
3,Disappointed in MN,"I am very disappointed with the Leap Pad I bought for my child over the holidays. Although I bought plenty of cartridges (most are $14.99 + Tax), my daughter does not find her Leap Pad all that exciting. Once in awhile she will take it out to play the games. The games quickly become redundant to my daughter who is a bright 4-year-old. Three times now I have watched my daughter poke at her Leap Pad with a bored look on her face.Suggestion to the company: Please make Leap Pads with an AC outlet ability for the children who do love their Leap Pads. Keeping the game supplied with fresh batteries is expensive!"
4,"""Magic Pen"" broken",Great concept - My 4 year old loved this toy but after 3 months of light use - the pen ceased to work rendering the toy useless. My 8 year old daughter has had the Leapfrog explorer globe since Christmas. It also uses the magic pen as an input devices. It makes it through about only about half her games without the need for a restart. Warranty also expires after 3 months.
4,This is a great new learning experience for kids.,"My daughter got this toy for her Birthday. She enjoys all of the booklets that i have boughten for the leap pad. The Leap pad is very, very easy to use. My daughter loves the story's the best because she can run the wand over the word and it will tell her what the word is and what the meaning is. Have fun, and ~~Happy Holidays~~"
1,NOT WORTH IT,"I purchased this item along with several cartridges as a gift for my 5 year old. He really never got into it, even though there were characters he likes such as Bob the Builder. IF YOUR CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER THEY WILL PROBABLY NOT BE VERY INTERESTED IN THIS ITEM. My son loves playing the computer, but the LeapFrog is not as interactive as a computer. If you have a computer, I would not suggest buying this product.JOE, a concerned father"
4,LEAP FROG PAD IS OUTSTANDING,"Having a six year old grandson who was struggling some in school we bought the Leap Frog pad for him. He loves it. My daughter purchased at least two additional books for him and in the past 4 weeks his teacher has noticed improvement for him and he loves to have her help him in the evening. Strongly reccomend it for kids which will help them grow with their school work and they will enjoy playing with it and learning as they do so.Jerry McClishNorth Ridgeville, Ohio"
1,"This is UK version, not US version","The product you receive when buying from this link is the UK version of the LeapPad. The book (worth roughly [...] of the purchase) uses a British accent. It is very hard to understand if you're American and is useless to a young child trying to learn phonics. Amazon will not let you exchange the product because it comes from an independent seller. (Although this product is eligible for Prime shipping, it doesn't come from Amazon.)Beyond that headache, the LeapPad is also a poor piece of technology. To answer questions, you must be fairly exact with the pen and press hard. If you don't do this quickly, the LeapPad ends the game, which is frustrating for a child. I'm not sure why everyone raves about this game."
1,Broken toys are not fun,"I purchased this for my child who has problems with fine motor skills. It turned out to be too much for her at the time (Christmas 2003) so I put it in the closet for later. When I took it out in the Fall of 2004 it no longer worked. (It made sounds like an electronic babbling brook)This toy had been used two or three times. I spent forever online at their web site trying to find a way to get help, scrolled through hundreds upon hundreds of trouble shooting questions and answers, followed the directions to email my question/problem to them, and never heard back. Needless to say, had the warranty been for one year, it ran out while I waited for them to get back to me. Good product or not, the customer service fell short. Next time I'll go with a brand that doesn't have a pencil attachment."
3,Printing pages for Leap Pad Learning System,I have found that this item does not securely fit the pages printed from a printer. It can be confusing for a small child trying to touch the figures. The pages must be perfectly centered on the leap pad for it to work. I have to secure the page with tape to keep it in place to react with the player correctly. The cord to the pen gets in the way of the book when turning the page. It is a great learning tool but it is in need of improvments.
3,My review on this is undescided,"I bought this for my 8 year old son, which at the time was 7. He was excited at first to get it, but that lasted maybe a couple day. Now it sits on his book shelf. I think it is a great learning toy,and I was very excited to get it.. I would still recomind it to people, because if you can get your kids interested it, than it would be worth your money. I have just tried the reading part of, but I might need to try the other things they have to offer for this product."
5,This is awesome,"I bought this for my son who just turned 4 and he LOVES it. He is just starting to read and it helps him along and gives him encouragement. He is even starting to memorize where all the states are on the map. It is very hard to find books for, because it is such a popular item."
3,Wish it was better,"Great idea needs to be be a bit better...don't like that once you write on a book it is permanent...essentially they can't use it again because there last answer is right there. Also, it slips alot. My daughter get's frustrated by the fact that when she turns the page or increases the volume that it sometimes takes 5 times...trying to position the book exactly right for the action to take place. Overall, I do like it although she doesn't play with it as much as I would have thought...it does make me feel better though that she has an educational toy, even though I have to ask her to play with it."
5,Love this toy!,"We have at least 6 books and my 4 year old can't get enough of them. There's so much to do and learn in each one.The toy itself could use some improvement though, the pen is a awkward because the cord always seems to be in the way. Also, my son has a hard time carrying it around because it's too big for him. There's another Leap Pad that's smaller, but the books don't work on it. Someone should look at the size of the toy with 3 and 4 year olds of all sizes."
3,leapfrog average toy,"This is pretty much an average toy. At first, he really liked it but it didn't keep his interest. He had much more fun and learning from the phonics desk and the math desk. In addition to that, those desks are much more durable. He got bored and chewed through the wire connecting the wand to the desk."
5,this is a great learning tool!,"we got the leap frog leap pad when our daughter was three. she caught on quickly and loves the fact that she can control the thing herself. not only does it build her motor skills by using the ""pen"", it builds her ability to concentrate on instructions. she loves it when she gets the answers correct and always says ""i did it mommy!!!"" one of the best learning toys we have gotten for her so far. great toy for long car trips or anywhere. there are lots of different books available you can change depending on the child's ability level. jamie warr"
3,Great TOOL,We bought this for our 5 1/2 year old grandson. His kindergarten has one in the room and it is considered a TOOL. The teacher noticed he was very interested and focused when using this and suggested it would be good for him to have one at home. I didn't rate this a 5 for fun because he considers that he is WORKING with his TOOL and loves every minute of it. The MATH book is especially useful in recognizing numbers out of sequence. We look forward to many years of use at higher levels.My only question is: Is it comatible with Quantum Leap Pad?
3,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY,"We purchased this toy for our son about a year and a half ago. Our son loved it. He would play with the Leap Pad everyday. After spending about [a lot of money] on the Leap Pad and lots of extra books we have decided to get rid of it. We went through 3 pens and it still didn't work properly. The Leap Pad never read words properly, the speech was garbled and slurred (even with new batteries), or sometimes the unit wouldn't work at all. Overall a great concept but poorly designed and manufactured.We have recently recieved the new Fisher Price Power Touch Learning System and are much happier with this product."
3,"Good, but....","My kids love their Leappad, but we've just found a bug in it. A major one. We had the Little Mermaid book in the Leappad and it started playing the story from Winnie the Pooh. We don't even own the Winnie the Pooh book. We have model #30004. The one colored lime green on the front and blue on the back."
1,Not much of an Aura,"The booklet is really small and there isn't much instructions. I can tell you that what you will be seeing is just an energy field around a person. Not the actual Aura though. I am able to see Auras 2 years ago (without the help of anybook), and wanted to teach others what Auras look like, so I had purchased this book just to check it out. To my disappointment, you would see only the etheric aura and not the shell - besides that you wouldn't be able to see the colors - just plain energy field. I'm using the traditional way to teach others how to view Auras. Training the peripheral vision, then the viewing. But all this takes practice, practice, and practice. The book is not worth it, since its so small. Just think of it as buying the glasses, though the price isn't quite right for inexpensive paper glasses."
2,You don't need glasses to see an aura,"Just use two eye sight. Stand a person 18 inches to 2 feet in front of a white wall with ambient indirect daylight, look past the outline of their head and shoulders at the wall, and if you keep focusing on the wall past their head, you will see it. You don't need the glasses. I learned this from the book called ""Auras-See Them In Just 60 Seconds"""
2,sounds better than it really is,"I have been trying to see auras for quite some time, and i thought this book would help me out, but when i put on the glasses i found no change in my weak aura perception abilities. It may be good for beginners, but if you have tried to see auras before and can't, don't rely too heavily on this book."
4,Pocket Door Lock,"We installed a pocket door when we remodelled our bathroom, and the lock that our contractor bought did not work very well. So I found this lock on Amazon. It is really a unique lock in how the extension twists open to lock the door. My contractor was reluctant to use it at first, but became a believer after he installed it and saw how it worked. I confess we have never locked the door in our every day use, and don't expect to use it very much, but it really does work if you need a lock for your pocket door."
4,POCKET DOOR LATCH,"GOOD DESIGN BUT IT DOES NOT ADJUST TO 2 3/4 BACKSET, ONLY 2 3/8. GOOD FINGER PULL. CHOICE OF COLORS."
1,This lock sucks.,"I installed this lock in my bathroom pocket door and the mechanism is so stiff that you can't even turn it to lock it. The whole thing works fine until you install it! I actually had this problem TWICE with the same model--my contractor broke the first one trying to fix the problem, so I had to buy a second one. I was hoping that the first one was just defective, but the second one I received was broken too!"
3,Malfunctioned when installed,Malfunctioned when installed. Unit would bind and not lock as designed. Because I had drilled the round hole in the door required for this type of hardware I was stuck with having to purchase another of the same type. The second device functioned as designed but still binds to some degree and does not operate smoothly.
5,"Slick and slim, great value","None of the online info shows how cool it is. Insalls like a regular door handle but hides in the profile of the door. When hidded in the pocket, the latch is flush until you push on it, then it pops out with a little handle to grab. Also, there is a strike plate not shown. When you go to lock it the ""handle"" pops out and deploys the latch into the stike plate then to the side, locking the door."
1,A Thesis-less Trip Through Casanova's Consciousness,"Are you looking for an interesting book about religion that has a cogent thesis? Well, don't look here. This is basically a random stroll through Casanova's stream of consciousness. Why bother having a tightly-constructed thesis when you can basically explain everything by describing it?! I will have two lumps of sugar with my extra thick tautology please."
2,Did not like it,"I received this book as a gift. I had it on my wish list based on reviews. In my opinion it is not worth the money. You can do the same by drawing boxy shapes on graph paper. Make one square equal one stitch. I think it would have helped if there were more instructions and perhaps some ideas for alterations. I did not like this book. I think I was expecting something different. It would help if this was one of items that you could see sample pages from. If I had been able to pre-view the sample pages, I never would have placed it on my wish list.Fashion Doll Knitting Graphs"
2,Disappointing,"I can't even tell you how many Frommer's books I've bought over the years. They are definitely my go-to travel guides. Having said that, this one was very disappointing. The descriptions were full of meaningless adjectives. There was no way to differentiate which restaurant or which lodging I might like better. One was the most beautiful, one the prettiest, one the loveliest. The author seemed to like rustic a lot which is not necessarily a compliment in my book. The restaurants were all a foodie's dream. He also devoted way to much space to wineries. There must be something else to do in Oregon besides drink wine. Not very helpful and boring to read."
3,real story is better than the movie,"This movie, clearly and transparently based on the last year in the life of Mary Pinchot Meyer, is, unfortunately, not as good as it could have been. All the real characters are here and very thinly disguised: Ms. Meyer, Cord Meyer, James Angleton, JFK, with the addition of a fictional nice teen-age boy who happens to live next door. This character is the problem. Though well-acted, the role is poorly conceived, and the boy's various shadowings and spyings look absurd. Plus there's some tiresome material set at his Catholic day school. Gretchen Mol is wonderful, as is the actor who plays the Angleton character. But this could have been so much better if the filmmakers had taken a tougher position. Left out are Ben and Tony Bradlee and their role in the destruction of Mary Pinchot Meyer's (possibly inflammatory) diary. On the plus side, the LSD scene is nicely done. Bottom line: a fascinating tale receives a mediocre treatment. What a shame!"
2,"Ok,","This movie shouls have shown a little more with and the president, not the after math because you got a better understaning of it."
3,Be Aware,"Despite what the ad says this is NOT the one featuring the voices of Beau Weaver, Lori Alan and Brian Austin Green. This is the latest version that was briefly shown on Cartoon Network. Here the Four wear radically different costumes and the Thing has a ""4"" spray painted on his chest. And Johnny, the Human Torch, is a complete idiot. But since this is basically a ""comedy adventure"" version of the FF I can overlook this. I cannot truely rate the DVD since I haven't seen it yet. But I did like the cartoon for what it was. Brainless fun."
1,there's racism in this cartoon,"in episode 14 Revenge of the Skrulls, there's a character with yellowish skin, black hair, big buck teeth & big goofy glasses, its the racist Asian caricature you see in old cartoons, kinda sad this stuff still goes on today"
5,Must have for any Marvel / Superhero or Fantastic 4 fan!,"This newer version of the Fanatastic 4 series in my opinion is better than the original Fantastic 4 in both it's stunning visuals as well as the storys.You get to see the fantastic 4 from their origin and them gaining their powers, and see them as they grow and learn to use their abilities which get them into various adventures. It's fun seeing the rivalary between human touch and grim with much sillyness. The storys are good for both young and older audiences, where older cartoons tended to be a little more kid sentric. You also see cameo's from other super hero's such as incredible hulk, she hulk, thor and so forth. Overall I highly reccomend this set to any fan of the fantastic 4, of the super hero genre in general. It was greatly entertaining to watch."
1,Disaster - A sure disappointment,"We love the Wiggles but this game's design is truly horrific. Before you can even play ten sets of cards have to be sorted into piles. The sorting is more educational than the game itself. The activities are almost too easy even for a pre-reader but you cannot play this game unless you are a reader or are playing with one. This game is way too easy for the recommended six to ten year olds. (eg: ""Name something red"") The instructions make no sense and the progress of the game is dreadfully slow. Just stay away from this game! Even the most ardent Wiggles fans will be bored. And parents - you will be haunted by the memory of being dragged into playing this game for a long time...."
2,to small not enough words,not enough words if your serious about studying the word of God i recomend the crudens concordance is a lot better with every word from the holy bible king james version
5,This is an amazing,This is an amazing book.... I have a lot of cookbooks by Hussain and not a one is less than great... and this is the best of the bunch. My favorite recipe here is the sweet and sour duck casserole.... more like a duck vindaloo.... The recipes are varied and overall delicious. Try her other books as well!!
5,AN AWSOME MUST-READ!,"I got the book on the 17th and between work, and traveling this past weekend, I finished the book last night and by the time my head hit my pillow I was overjoyed.I'm sure we all have a story to tell, but `BEHIND THE SCREEN' depicts a moving and `TRUE-TO-LIFE"" portrayal for anyone who has experienced or even thought about online dating and/or developing friendships via this medium (the internet).Stormy, you definitely deserve 5 Stars, 2 Thumbs-up AND a `SUSTHA-GURL-HANDS-ON-HER-HIPS NECK JERK' on this one.Continued Blessings and Success to you and yours both in front of and Behind The Screen!"
4,The Ups and Downs of Computer Dating,"I just finished reading BEHIND THE SCREEN today and found that Charles and Kyla's stories and views felt very familiar to me. I've never cyber-dated, but I have a couple of friends who met on line so when I saw this book being offered during the AABCS Cruise, I picked it up. It's obvious that the author has had some experience in this area whether it was her own personal experiences or those of others that she knows well. Some of the book was funny and some was serious. There were some areas that could have been expanded upon or just maybe outlined a little better, but overall, I think it was a good read. I'd recommend that you buy it in the softcover version instead of the hardback. The softcover is less expensive and you'll be more likely to agree that the book is worth the money invested."
2,Skeptical that this is a 50-pack,"Bought (and paid for) the ""fifty-pack"" which turned out to be a single, drawn handybox that was perfectly average/serviceable in every way. I complained, but never got the remaining 49 pieces. I'm not sure if it was a mistake or a scam, but it was definitely BOGUS advertising."
2,Ohio Indian disappointment,I must admit the title of the book was accurate but I expected more anthropoligal information.
4,Finn looks at working-class literacy versus elite literacy,"This book shows literacy at a socio-economic level, and what teachers of the working-class schools need to strive for in their classrooms. It answers descriptively the reasons schooling and literacy for the America's working-class children are not the same for other levels of the social spectrum. It is insightful and inspirational!"
2,Disappointing,"This is the smaller and worse thanInferno ClubandPrivate Passion (German and French Edition) (English, German and French Edition). Unlike the other two books from this photographer and model this book isn't worth the price. Also it doesn't offer anything not seen in larger images in the other books."
1,Bad Girl,A beautiful young women in a largely degrading context ...you won't see any smiles. Unique and appealing artistry but poor in spirit.
3,Missing arrows,"A generally informative book, but.....some of the directions refer to diagrams with arrows showing the direction of the rope. No such arrows!Overall fair to good diagrams and interesting history, but I think I would have bought a different book had I known what was missing."
4,Good intro book,This book is a very good introduction to sailing knots and rope work. If you're looking for a book on decorative knot working this is not the book you want. Though it's filled with lots of useful knots and techniques it's really geared toward rigging and sail work be it on a one man sailing skif or a massive sailing ship from centuries ago I think the information contained here in would at worst give you a solid base to learn from.
4,"The Arts of the Sailor: Knotting, Splicing and Ropework",Good informative book in the areas of knotting and ropework but lacks information on splicing weaves. Only shows how to splice twists. Halyards on my boat are weaves as are on most sailboats and therefore I'll have to obtain this information elsewhere.
3,"OK, but not great","I didn't find this book helpful. Most of her advice, which is few and far in between, anyone who reads interior design magazines or has common sense would already know. What little advice she gave was practically useless--shun ""silk"" flower arrangements (for those of us live in areas where cut flowers are not abundant and cheap, I found this to be rather snobbish.)--Paint all your rooms beige--but make sure they are ""complex"" colors like mine--but then she doesn't tell you where to get them. So there is a clear lack of practical advice. This is mostly a book about a designer musing on her houses and high opinion of herself. Not inspiring at all."
1,"Very boring, very depressing and not comfortable looking","The rooms in this book are boring, depressing, and not comfortable looking. As a newcomer to the decorating book world (I'm looking at lots of books as I work on my home), I am learning to beware of words such as ""luxurious,"" or ""taste,"" or ""elegance"" which may indicate that some author or designer is about to tell me how I should live. As I went through this book I saw that this author's idea of ""luxury"" is very formal and stiff which (to me) is not ""luxurious"" at all. Luxury (to me) means being able to relax completely in my home. Unfortunately, this author doesn't get that and has filled this book with overly formal, overly fussy, overly traditional and therefore uncomfortable rooms. I can't imagine who would really want to live this way."
2,Not what I expected. A waste of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$,"The rooms in this book are attractive enough but they don't fit the book's title or premise. I feel cheated because I wanted a book that does what it promises by telling me how to create 'luxurious, livable spaces.' I knew I hated the photo on the cover but bought the book anyway, which was my mistake. (A room with one ottoman in it? Is that 'livability?') After I bought the book, I read that the author is a designer who is big in New York. That explains a lot about the stiffness and unreality of the rooms shown in the book. Some of those New York designers should get out and see the rest of America some time. This book is not what it is cracked up to be."
2,Out of touch with the times,"This designer seems very out of touch with the times. The title talks a good game but the contents don't deliver to homeowners, including affluent ones, who want to go home and relax after work. The rooms are so refined, so perfect, so staid, so unlivable that they seem like a throwback to a decade or two ago. They certainly don't fit today, and I'm sorry I bought this."
1,"Oh, come on........","The title of this book is a lie. The places shown in this book and the pricey products shown in those places make this book a lovely book to look at but not a book that will give you any ideas you can act on. If you want a coffee table book to impress friends or to browse through, fine. If you have tens of thousands of dollars to spend on one room, fine. But if you want to learn how to create ""luxurious, livable spaces,"" do not buy this. I bought it and I'm sorry. I'm annoyed with the author, and I'm annoyed with myself for buying into the lie."
2,Tombs,"Some of the rooms in this book are good, some not so much. I like the format of this book very much, however too many of the looks presented therein can be a little underdone. That's not necessarily a bad thing. I just wonder if it makes for compelling interior design. I must admit, however, I have referred to this book a good deal."
1,Is it just me?,"Is it just me, or do other people find designer's books like this sort of dated and even annoying? I received this as a birthday gift and I looked through it and was put off. I don't need a so-called tastemaker to tell me how to decorate, and I found the rooms shown very sort of grim and dated. They sure don't like very livable. I think this designer is buying into the dated old ""do your house to show off for your friends"" mentality. The rooms are very offputting. Bleah!"
1,"Pretentious, stiff and stuffy","What were they thinking? Whoever put this book together doesn't have a clue about creating luxurious, livable spaces. This book is a turnoff. I'd call this funeral home or hotel lobby design or designing to impress the ladies who lunch crowd. This book is obviously about how to spend a fortune in the process, too. Real luxury is about comfort and unpretentious ease, not necessarily money. Unfortunately, this designer does not seem to get that."
1,A book for a very small segment of readers,"With birthday money, I indulged myself with several decorating books recently. I'm not fond of this one, and I've enjoyed reading other amazon buyers' comments. This book might appeal to a very small segment of readers who are either truly upscale and formal or snobby wanna-bes. It's about showing off ""fine"" furnishings instead of putting your feet up and living the typically casual American lifestyle. It's a high-end book by a high-end designer for a clientele that's either very formal or simply show-off. It's not for everyone. I'm a high-end consumer, but this book and these room designs certainly are not for me. I'd rather relax, thank you."
1,does anyone check these reviewers?,"The ""reader from Florida"" review sounds as if the author wrote it. It sounds fake. And no one signed a name to it which makes me believe it's fake. I just wrote a review of this. We tested this book at a gathering of affluent suburban Chicago women, and we agreed that it didn't show the kind of comfort we all want right now. We are not into junk furniture or beat up furniture but into rooms that look welcoming and relaxing vs. formal and stiff. Some of the attempts to create ""luxurious livable spaces"" in this book were actually funny because they were so far off the mark."
4,"Solid, entertaining read from Mrs. Himes Gomez","Hines is clearly a master of furniture placement and--it is rumored--an excellent antiques shopper. Her rooms are refined, warm, uptown and expensive; they are not young, they are not hip. She is traditional, but nothing here is ever stolid or dull.Though soft monochromatic rooms often photograph as a wash, in person they are a different animal altogether, often rich and highly textural. The same problem plagues pictures in the books of Jeffrey Bihuber and Vicente Wolf: you can never capture what those rooms feel like in person (and I've been in them).Hines is a good place to start if dallying in design. Her text is clear and makes for a nice read. She plays by the rules. Nothing here is earth-shattering, but it is all close to perfection. (not all clients want earth-shattering, and you probably don't either). If you think one of these types of rooms is easy to pull together, then--believe me--you probably have never tried it."
4,It's about time for Sulu,"Finally a book that gives us some insight into the private life of Sulu. We have been bombarded with information about Kirk, Spock and Bones but little has been done to add to our knowledge of the rest of the characters. While the ending became rather obvious long before the book gets there, it is still a well written book that delves into the struggle of Star Fleet officers before their families were allowed to travel with them (TNG). I was truly able to feel the internal struggle of both men."
5,One of the best Star Trek books in the numbered series.,"As might be expected by anyone familiar with Peter David's later writing, this book, one of his earlier efforts in the Star Trek universe, is one of the best of the series. It is a perfect example of his style, which is very distinctive: high action, high emotional drama, but always told with a tongue-in-cheek wit that keeps the reader from feeling that he takes his stories TOO seriously. Even though it is an early effort, and in some ways his writing matured over the years, I would still rate this not only as one of the best ""Trek"" stories, (as many of his stories could be said to be) but also one of his best."
4,Wine bottle stoppers,"These were quite elegant and the perfect gift for true wine connoseur, who has everything. Thank you very much."
3,Not the best,"There are two types of poetry translators -- those who translate precisely what the poet has written, and those who make small embellishments to improve the sound of the poem in English. I prefer the former. Even though the poem no longer rhymes and might not sound like something someone would write today, it is closer to the original meaning.Unfortunately, this book falls into the second category. I prefer Wallace Fowlie's ""Rimbaud"" published in 1967 (still available on Amazon). It contains the complete works of Rimbaud, plus some letters he wrote. Fowlie also has a newer translation written with Seth Whidden and published in 2005, which I have not read. If you know any French at all, you will see what I'm talking about when you read these books (or search inside them here on Amazon). The original poems are presented first in French, then in English, so it's easy to see if the translator has added his own flourishes, or has remained true to the original text."
5,One of the best reggae albulms EVER.,"This albulm is one of my favorite albulms ever. Every song makes your spine tingle and gives you goosebumps from the pure beauty and power of each song. This is a must have for any reggae fan. I just fixed my record player and played my old LP and each time a new song came on I thought to myself, ""Oh my god, this is my new favorite song."" This continued throughout the record. BUY THIS ALBULM!!!"
4,Get these for your older sportbike.,OEM style turn signals for mid to late '80's sport bikes. Comes with bulb and has a rubber stalk. Includes plenty of wire to get this connected. Amber plastic lense and metal bolt in stock. These look like the OEM blinkers on Kawasaki and some other older sport bikes.
5,Amazing record by Sixx!!!!!,"This CD is just awesome. I love the Crue and anything Nikki Sixx is involved with but even I was blown away by the depth of this record. If you like music that bites back than you better buy this now!!! This could be the record of the year (but so could the Crue's ""New Tattoo"". Different.....but good."
4,nikki sixx seems to have found a forum for his darker sides,while the darker... more introspective lyrics are not what the fans want from his more familiar gig... motley crue... nikki has always bemoaned the fact that as a songwriter.. he wants to write about everything.. not just girls and money and drugs... i think that 58 is a perfect example of what motley could never be. at first glance... people might think that this is an answer to tommy lee's methods of mayhem solo project.. since nikki has slipped in some hip-hop... pop... and grudgy sounding songs in here... but this isn't metal rap... this is thoughtful... and something that i plan to listen to quite a bit... til i wear it out...
3,Good but not esential cd,"Im I Big Fan Of Motley Crue, but this is not Motley Crue, this is more that Methotds Of Mayhem,Good Bass line From Niky Sixx, but the music is very electronic"
2,5 stars? did I miss something?,"58 is an interesting experiment from Nikki Sixx. While there are some good tracks on this cd, it is not worthy of 5 stars. Isn't 5 stars reserved for true classics that sold tens of millions of copies and are worshiped by music lovers worldwide like Nevermind, Thriller and Appetite For Destruction? This album will never be a classic, 99% of people don't even know it exists."
2,The Hobo Philosopher,"This is obviously one of Manchester's earlier productions. It really doesn't sound like Manchester at all. I was very surprised because I like Mr. Manchester.I kept reading and turning each page expecting the book to begin in that shocking, startling, exciting Manchester way. It never happened.But nevertheless it was interesting to read as a typical Rockefeller bio. It contains the basics - nothing shocking or controversial. It is the same old same old.Compared to Manchester's later work this hardly seem to be the same author.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:America On Strike - Labor History"
5,Vivid and brilliant,"Patti Powell's book is a hilarious and scathing account of her experiences teaching in both the public and private school systems of central Louisiana. A disclaimer: I've enjoyed Patti Powell's wit and incisive observations in person since seventh grade, although we have not lived in the same town since high school. Patti calls a spade a spade. No doubt this is partly the reason she has butted heads with school administrators more interested in protecting the bureaucracy than educating students. She is also a compassionate and gifted teacher willing to ask hard questions about why we accept the outrages so prevalent today in many of our schools. Although Patti's story is about particular schools in central Louisiana, the politics and bureaucratic impulses she describes are universal. Some of the characters (real, but with pseudonyms) will stay with you forever. This book will make you laugh out loud, even as you shake your head in dismay."
3,One school district's dirty little secrets!,"As a friend and former student of Ms. Powell, I'm so proud of her for writing this book and getting it published! I really enjoyed the book, (even if my parents were mentioned in a not-so-favorable light!), because as a teacher in this district, I was able to figure out who most of the main players were. I'm only rating it a 3, because I'm not sure that people outside this district will really appreciate the humor. Even though the book focuses on all the problems Ms. Powell had as a teacher here, I think the overview of what problems educators face on a regular basis makes this book a worthy read."
2,Not helpful at all...,I am very fearful of death and had hoped to find some tools for coping with such in this book. I was not so lucky. This is not the book for you if you are looking for the same.
1,Disappointment,"This book is not what I was looking for. I'm 0 for 2 on books about dying. This one is written with a heavy Christian base, and yet I am Jewish. This book was not for me. At least it did not tell me about what the title says it will."
4,I believe,Rich does a great service to the workings out of the historic struggle in this area. Very readable and well cited. Read along with Leithart's.
3,I returned it and was never notified of the amount taken off my credit card. That was over 4 weeks ago.,"The anklet was nice, but my daughter wanted to return it. I never got an e-mail stating that it was returned, nor did I get it taken off my credit card as of yet."
5,Great Interpretation,"This is a great interpretation of the classic book. It sticks pretty close to the original story, and the actresses play the March girls so well. I was afraid this wouldn't be that good because the book is such a well-loved classic, but I was happily wrong about that."
2,"SPEEDY DELIVERY, BUT....","Great service on delivery time, but unfortunately, the sound quality was bad. We started to watch the movie on Christmas eve, but had to stop because we couldnt hear the voices!!!! Disappointing..."
2,"Not ""New""","I bought this video and expected it to be ""NEW"" (according to its description), but it was scratched. It skips at a certain point in the movie. I don't know if I'll buy anything from this seller again."
1,Wish I could get it to play,I was so excited to purchase my copy of this film because it's one of my favorites. But it won't play. It won't play in any American DVD player. That's something that should have been advertised.
1,Just plain HORRIBLE!,"Don't waste your money or your time on this HORRIBLE remake of a wonderful film. This movie is an insult to Louisa May Alcott. The story does not even follow the book, the acting is terrible, the casting is terrible, and the character study is non-existent. I won't even add this to my collection, and I have no one I would want to give this to. It's just that bad. Pathetic, absurd, boring and emotionless. Avoid it."
1,blah,"if one was to compare katharine hepburn to winona ryder, the results would be obvious. the book isn't supposed to be a feminist account, it's supposed to be a civil war tale of a family. since it's so modern, and the acting and even the colors are modern, we never feel the full experience, or that we are in the 1800's. In the 1933 version we feel a part of the family. This is less than inspiring. how clare danes became Beth, i'll never know, what Kirsten dunst is doing here is a mystery. Although SUsan Sarandon is fine, she is the best thing in here, but nowhere near spring bryington. Christian bale is too dreamy, and his and winia'a chemisrty isn't right. it doesn't follow the book, and the cast is miscast. I don't recommend, instead watch the beautifully done 1933 CLASSIC, or even the 1949 one with June Allyson and Margaret O'brien. Skip this."
3,little women,Good not as good as the first ryder is good and dunts is.the rest of girls are so bleak.
5,Great book for your library,This is a great book for anyone to keep in their library. I've read it twice and watched the movie many times.
4,my daughter had to watch it for a class!,It was nice to be able to download it and watch it the night before the assignment was due! She liked the movie!
1,Won't play in most U.S. DVD Players,I wish it would have more prominently stated that this DVD is in PAL format and will not play on most U.S. DVD players.
2,Unwanted subtitles,The dvd has subtitles at the bottom that you can't remove! I was not happy about that and we can't remove them :(
1,for the European market,"Love the movie, I watch it every Christmas. Somehow, when ordering this, I missed or it was omitted, that it was for European DVD players only. Won't work on the players made for the American market. I wish it would have been clearer when I ordered it."
5,"Underrated, sexy, brilliant Christian Bale!!!!!!!!!!","This movie, Little Women had me so hooked from the moment I pressed play on my dvd remote. After seeing Christian in A Mid-Summer Night's Dream,Velvet Goldmine, and Shaft, I became a true believer that he is one of the most brilliant, sexy, most underrated actors that I've ever seen. In Little Women, he captured my heart, soul,and he just plain took my breath away. I have not been so taken with a romantic performance by a male since Richard Chamberlain, in The Thorn Birds! Christian is so handsome,charming,and romantic as ""Laurie"",that I just melted when he got his heart broken by Jo, I screamed at the t.v., Are you blind! You've got to get this movie for the holidays, it's perrrrfect."
5,"A ""Little"" Bit Goes a Long Way","""Little Women"" is a wonderful novel written by Louisa May Alcott about four March sisters. The oldest is Meg, short for Margaret, then comes Jo, a boyish fifteen year-old who is greatly interested in literature, next is quiet, peaceful Beth, and finally gorgeous Amy, the artist of the family. Marmee (their mother) is a kind woman who is watching over her children while Mr.March is at war. The four girls do the best they can to help out. The March family faces a numerous amount of obstacles which they eventually overcome. If I were to rate this book from one to five, I would surely give it a five for being enlighening, touching, exhilarating and all in all wonderful!!"
1,Absurd story line!,the movie did follow the book... BUT the story itself was absolutely absurd and illogical.the ending was unexpected and unreasonable; JO SHOULD HAVE ENDED UP WITH LAURIE!!!!!!!!!Winona Ryder was horrible portraying Jo.The only good thing in this movie is Laurie (Christian Bale was fine tho!) and even he turned out weird!!!!
3,Solid,"Okay, it's a bit schmaltzy, and steeped in our modern views--some of which Alcott shared, but couldn't print--but it's a reasonable interpretation of the book. I thought the casting was very good, and Susan Sarandon did a particularly fine job as Marmee. The most outstanding part of this production is that it succeeds in making John Brooke interesting, Professor Bhaer sexy, and the Professor and Jo's romance believable. Much as I enjoy the book, I think Alcott failed on those last points."
4,DVD Little Women,Condition as discribed. In good mailer and DVD of Little Women is very good. Would use this seller again.
4,Wow,"I felt that this version of little women, is the best ever made. All the girls fit there parts perfectly. You feel as though you know them. JO was absolutly fabulas. I thought the movie was great. Definatly worth your time and money. If you like classics or ""old"" movies.... you don't wanna miss this one. 4 stars maybe more!!!!"
2,preachy and ahistorical,"Having loved the book as a girl and enjoyed the earlier film versions, I had high expectations for this remake. Sadly, those expectations were dashed. I didn't have as much of a problem with the movie departing from the text, because I believe that movies always interpet the books which inspired them anyway. My objection pertains to the degree or extent of interpretation. What I disliked most about this remake was its unrelenting preachiness and the ahistorical way it projected 1990's values into the past. I thought the book was feminist and modern in its own context, and so its variant of strong womanhood should have been honored on its own terms rather than devalued by reinterpreting it in our terms, while still locating the story in the past. In so doing, this movie implied that the best, the only valid, and the most enlightened feminism is the one we know today. That's just plain old conceit."
1,The Sarandon Version,"Others have written praising the updating of this classic story. I found the updating sad and came away sorry that this film of the book kept the original title. The new movie imposes modern liberal and feminist values on the old story and rips out the simple christian goodness that made the classic shine.I will agree with other reviewers that the new version is beautifully executed, but the simple joy and goodness of the book was left out."
2,A decided opinion,"First of all, Winona Ryder is no Jo March. She ruins the whole movie. Very bad casting indeed. If it wasn't for that, the movie would of been excellent."
2,Not As Good As The Book by Alcott,"I felt I was missing something thoughout this whole movie. I haven't run across anyone who doesn't regard it as a classic or a masterpiece that tugs at their heart strings...but I just didn't feel it.It feels too much like a movie...too much drama, too much music, and too many colorful costumes. I know it's a movie, but when I watch movies I usually am not thinking: ""movie, movie movie"" throughout the whole thing.Not one of my favorites. I like the book this is loosely based on better."
2,Not a good remake,"This movie is ok, but I prefer the 1949 one with Elizabeth Taylor. I hated Winona's acting, and I didn't like how Gabriel Byrne played Prof. Bhaer in this movie. But good thing Christian Bale was in it.This one is ok, but the 1949 version is much better."
4,"Not completely true to the book, but enjoyable.",Just a side note on this film if you haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a while...Laurie is played by Batman. Christian Bale.
4,Cyndi's view,It is such an amazing movie! This is my second copy of this movie. I loved watching it so much that I had to get a newer copy in order to enjoy some more. The sister who plays the piano was super. All the sisters in this movie had such wonderful chemistry. Christian Bale was outstanding. I love how he came to maturity. He loves Jo so much and then he was able to marry Amy. This movie is so much fun to watch!
5,6 stars! This movie started my obsession w/ period pieces! Must see!!,"A beautiful, believable story with a wonderfully accomplished cast (Susan Sarandon, Christian Bale, Winona Ryder, Kirsten Dunst, Gabriel Byrne) - Ms. Alcott would be proud! I have nothing but the highest praise for this adaptation!! Save yourself the rental costs and just buy it already! You will be amazed at how often you find yourself watching it."
5,Just wonderful,"This has to be one of my favourite movies ever. I absolutely love it. It's the best version of the story so far I think. The 1944 one isn't too faithful to the book (Amy is older than Beth for a start) and the 1933 one has dated,despite a very contemporary performance from Katherine Hepburn.The cast in this is ideal. Winona Ryder (though far too pretty for Jo) is perfect, as is the rest of the cast, especially Susan Sarandon and Kristin Dunst. Clare Danes's death scene must be one of the most touching ever.Only I always watch it with the thought ""Why on earth didn't Jo end up with Laurie."" Especially when they had such chemistry like in this version"
5,Compendio de la mejor poesia del maestro,"Bennedetti es un autor que nos tiene acostumbrados a lo cotidiano, a lo urbano, al sentir de seres normales ante situaciones que se le dan a cualquiera. Su poesia, a diferencia de lo tradicional, es abierta, amplia, sutil en su forma de hacer llegar el mensaje, pero sin tabues ni complicaciones. Este libro viene en dos ediciones, una de ellas incluye un disco compacto con todas las poesias leidas por el autor mismo. En todo caso, es la mejor recoleccion de poesia de Bennedetti. Disfrutela"
5,No introduction is necessary...,"No itroduction is necesary when we are talking about Mario Benedetti. His capacity to comunicate with the reader, the simplicity, and the humanity of his works is what makes him famous all through latin america. ""My estrategy is deeper and more simple My estrategy is that same day I don't know how or with what pretext you finally need me"" Benedetti. Beautiful indeed"
1,Don't bother,This book is a sad reminder of what repugnicans once were. How can a party sink to multitudes of degrees of filth and worthlessness.
4,A basically fair account,"I will admit right away that I am a conservative Republican. I did like the book, but found it grating in some places. Therefore I rate it as a fair account. (Nelson Rockefeller was not Conservative! Michael Dukakis is not a moderate!)I also find it odd that the publisher couldn't get one Republican elected official to review the book. (While the Book on the Democrats has two such reviews.) It is also notable that the Republicans had to suffer disection by a liberal partisan Democrat. The publishers let another liberal Democrat write the book on the Democrats. It struck me as true to life."
3,Decent read,"I was expecting a bit too much out of this book. I am a home schooling father, and was looking for a bit of brass tacks advice on getting better involved in my kids' classical education. It is a fairly easy read, but there's just not much substance. Honestly, the most detailed chapter is the one about getting your kids involved in government. I suppose that shouldn't be surprising considering the author's passions. (The edition I own is littered with horrible typos and even obvious draft notes.) Even so, it's worth the read."
2,not recommended,"If you know anything about Michael Farris, nothing in the book will surprise you. It is solidly conservative (perhaps leaning fundamentalist) Christian and political thought. I skimmed it to see if it might be helpful to my husband but can't say I would recommend it."
5,My Eye to the Horizon,"My family has origins in Southwest Virginia and I always wondered when we drove south down I-77 what the sign ""Appalachian Trail"" meant. The author did an excellent job describing his journey. I found the book easy to read. His attention to his surroundings and his honesty made it hard for me to put the book down. I met the author and his wife this past summer before reading the book. I have a tremendous amount of respect for these people and hope to someday make this journey myself. The trip obviously takes intense planning and the author not only shares some of his resources with us, but he also shares some of the changes he made during his trek whether it be shoes he wore or the type of tent he changed to later in his journey through New England. It is not just a hiker book. It is a story of determination. It is a story of not only setting a goal, but attaining it with the help of his family. Good Book!"
2,"Walk, eat, sleep, walk, eat, sleep - it's foggy today...","I'm sorry, but I found this book too boring to even finish. I'd have to agree with the lone 2-star reviewer who said it is just another trail log. There is little in the way of wildlife and scenery descriptions, other than a laundry list of species observed, and not much as far as stories about people the author met on the trail. Mostly, the author wrote a paragraph or so per day about what he ate, how far he walked, and where he slept.There are a few photographs, many out of focus, and all in black and white.This book is not cheap, and in my opinion, not worth reading."
2,Just Another Trail Log,"After the high praise and 5-star rating of the other reviewers, I expected much more than just another AT thru-hike trail log. Logs of similar, if not better, quality can be found on numerous Internet sites. For a published work, I expected to see a lot more depth on Trail history, interesting people encountered and creative insights. Even the 8-12 photos at the start of each chapter were black and white! The text meanders from day to day, becoming increasingly repetitive as the chapters pile up. On the plus side, I did get a few insights into the VT/NH section I'll be hiking this fall that go beyond what is available in the guidebook.In retrospect, this book might appeal more to readers with limited long-distance hiking experience. Hmmm, perhaps I should publish my Trail notes?"
3,The cheap shovel works better,"I bought this mostly off the rave reviews it gets here. I wish I could say my experience was the same. As far as build quality this thing is a tank, very sturdy and seems like it will last a long time. This comes at a price of weight which isn't a big deal most of the time but if you have a lot of snow to move it will wear you down faster. The problem I had with this shovel comes from the wear strip. Great idea to make the shovel last longer but unfortunately instead of ""gliding"" along a surface when shoveling is just digs in or drags is maybe the better description. Concrete sidewalk, wood deck or asphalt driveway I couldn't get it to go a foot without fighting to get it to go further. In the end I just drilled out the rivets and removed the wear strip, glides smooth as butter now. I know it won't last as long but at least it's usable....next time I'll just buy the cheap one season throw away shovel."
5,Greatest Snow Shovel,"I have owned this shovel for over 7 years. Didn't think it would last 2 years. Not only do I use it but all my neighbors do too. Everyone that uses it wants one for themselves. If you can find one, buy it. Best 15.00 dollars I've spent."
4,suncast snow shovel,bought this as a joke gift.... our son lives in NM in the desert....not suppose to snow.... got socked in for 3 days...no shovel...
3,cannot say,It has not snowed after I bought this showel so probably might know how good it is only next year.
5,If ever we need to heed this poet it is now,"Seeing a posting for a new biography of Wilfred Owen reminded me to return to this anthology of his poems. Every war has produced great poets and WWI was fixed in our minds by the sensitive words of Siegfried Sassoon and especially Wilfred Owen. Writing from the trenches Owen managed to keep his eyes and mind and heart wide open while he witnessed the horrid plunder that surrounded him.. That he was able to transpose these experiences into the transcendentally beautiful poems that fill this book is a major wonder. Yes, WWII had WH Auden et al and the hungry monster machine of war was again made into words. And poets wrote of Korea, of Vietnam, and other countries' poets wrote of other wars. But again the threats and facts cloud our lives and world, and their words seemingly fall on deaf ears. Would that we could take heed of the poems of such perfection as those here by Wilfred Owen. This is the time to study this book........daily."
3,A lot of theory,"Jomini joined this group of 19th century writers who tried to benefit from their experiences on the Napoleonic battlefields to gain a certain reputation and probably make a better living. Like Clausewitz, he was not among the most glorious generals of these wars but had enough insight to teach to others (at least to attempt this). The result is not completely useless and many of his thoughts are valuable but they remain very theoretical. In addition, this theory mainly applies (when not erroneous) to armies of that time and then doesn't reach the level of a theory on the art of war itself. The main interest I find to this book is to get an idea on what people of that time could be thinking about the art of war given the exceptional warlike era they went through a few years before writing these kind of studies."
1,i never ordered nor recieved this,i just found this under my past purchases and i never purchased this or have i ever recieved it. I don't even own a kindle.
4,Can't complain,"Received this for free from the Android Amazon Kindle App. At first it was not what I thought. Downloaded it anyway, good read."
3,Poor Art of War book ... I don't like it!,"I have read so many Art of War books that I can remember the total number. There are just two types of Art of War books: Good and Bad. Bad books have the same trend of interpreting the Art of War, and when you open it you will know it by the first page when it talks about Tao. I would not go to far analyze the book because everyone has different opinion about books. To me, if you are hardcore about the Art of War or try to use Art of War for business strategy, this book should not be on your reading list. :-)"
2,Returned due to printing errors!,"I had to return this book due to the high number of printing errors contained inside. After 10 errors, I decided not to even bother counting the rest. Why is Amazon selling books like this? I found a better edition of this book in the catalog, but I wish someone had posted a review about the poor quality of the translation and printing."
3,Still reading,"It seems most of this is common sense. But in today's times, maybe we need a little reminder! It is on my bookshelf at work though, so everyone knows I mean business."
2,Too short & all repeat releases!,"ALL of these cartoons have been released on DVD in Disney Treasures sets, so no reason to get this.Orphan's Benefit (1934) - already on ""Mickey Mouse in B&W; volume 1""Farmyard Symphony (1938) - already on ""Silly Symphonies volume 1""Mickey's Grand Opera (1936) - already on ""Mickey Mouse in Color volume 1""How to Dance (1953) - already on ""The Complete Goofy""Donald's Dilemma (1947) - to be released on ""Chronological Donald volume 3"" on December 11, 2007.Music Land (1935) - already on ""Silly Symphonies volume 1""Woodland Café (1937) - already on ""Silly Symphonies volume 1""Pluto's Blue Note (1947) - already on ""The Complete Pluto volume 2"""
2,Not really a Mickey Mouse DVD,"My 2 young boys love the classic Mickey Mouse & Friends shorts on the Sports Adventures DVD. So I thought it would be fun to get one with music.However, there isn't much Mickey Mouse or Friends on this DVD. So my boys don't enjoy it.I made the assumption based on the cover and the description that the shorts would be centered on the classic characters. But most of them don't even have the classic characters in them.Very disappointed."
3,Same short as on another classic cartoon favorite!,"Everyone has already mentioned that these shorts are also on the treasure dvds but no one has mentioned that there is one on here that is also on another dvd from this series!!! Yes, ""how to dance"" is also on classic cartoon favorites starring goofy! I didn't think Disney would stoop so low as to duplicate shorts on the classic cartoon favorites line but they have. I now will check and see if any of the others are copied onto the other ones I have. Shame on you Disney!"
5,Fun for the whole family,"Fun for the whole family to watch...over and over and over. You know what I mean if you have a young child. My daughter is two and loves to watch movies many more times than once. And she loves anything with Mickey Mouse. These cartoon classics are great. They keep her attention, but allow for her to go play and come back to watch a new one and still understand. It also plays on a loop...sits on the menu screen for a couple of minutes before restarting itself."
3,Okay classic,"My 2 year old daughter loves the old Mickey Mouse movies. This one wasn't exactly the ""music"" edition we were looking for, but still an OKAY buy!"
1,Not Great,"This is not exactly what I expected. My daughter loves the other classic Mickey movies, but this one was a disapointment. Wouldn't buy again or recommend."
5,oh my lord!,"This is one of those albums, that at first listen, i gasp, jump up and down, shake my hands wildly and start chanting ""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!!"" IT ROCKS!!!! Nick Cave and his cohorts create such believably dark and menacing atmospheres that you can feel the fear. it's sooooo raw. all the tracks have this sleazy evil mood...like a strip joint in the swamp at night. all the tracks are perfect; it's one of those perfect cd's that can be listened from start to finish. it's just so coherent. if you want a goth cd...i mean real dark goth...get this cd. it basically screams ""Hands up! Who wants to die?""...well actually Nick does. ;-) you can hear all the Stooges influence...It's like ""Nightclubbing"" meets ""Search and Destroy""...super charged doom and gloom. God Bless You, Birthday Party!"
5,Tonight We Sleep in Separate Ditches,"To categorize this CD as ""goth"" or ""blues influenced"" or ""Stooges-like"" is a gross oversimplification. Nick Cave is at his best bible infused morbid-ism. The addition of Einsturzende Neubauten's (and future Bad Seed) Blixa Bargeld on `Mutiny in Heaven' is pure genius. The CD in its entirety is pure genius. A timeless classic, for sure.An excerpt from `Deep in the Woods':Now the killed waits for the killerAnd the trees all nod their heads, they are agreedThis knife feels like a knife feels like a knife that feels like it's feed.Yeah I recognize that girlI took her from rags right through to stitches (pray for me now)Oh baby, tonight we sleep in separate ditches."
1,bad cleat,"the laceless design give you a loose fit,but it gives you wierd ball feeling,and it is really hard to get your feet into it without the lace. i won't buy another one."
4,Do you feel like I do?,"Peter Frampton has one of my all-time favorite songs, the awesome guiter filled, lyrically stunning... Do you Feel Like I Do. This song is absolutely one of my favorites and this recording of it is great. The rest of the album is Classic Frampton, so if your a fan it's a must have."
1,"FRAMPTON, ALIVE, AGAIN","I liked it better the first time when it was called Frampton Comes Alive. To be fair, a lot of bands put out live albums after each and every tour...The Stones, McCartney, even KISS...and most of the time, just like being at the actual event, you have to sit through the 'new' stuff to get to the classic stuff. But for Frampton to put out yet another LIVE ALBUM is like Christopher Cross putting out a greatest hits. Frampton only has one album...live or otherwise, that needs to be bought. This ain't it."
4,"Modern ""live"" release","Excellent ""live"" cd. As I said in a previous review for ""Frampton Comes Alive"", I got the opportunity to see Frampton up close in a small hall and I was blown away by the show. This ""live"" release is a carbon copy of that show. The only thing missing was his hair. It was great to see Peter Frampton touring again, he is a very talented guitar player/singer and puts on a great show. The pause during the song ""Show Me The Way"" when he sings ""spinning in a circle"", the band actually spun around causing the delay in the song."
2,Same Ol' Songs But Older,"I'm a fan but am disappointed with this CD. These songs are available on older Frampton CDs or on the internet. The prior live versions are more interesting than what's here. There is a certain ""old friend vibe"" about this CD, but I'm ticked at paying [amt] for songs that are weaker versions of what I already have. Let's start focusing on today and tomorrow Peter....."
5,Better than the 1st.,"I got this for my wife, and I listen to it more than she does. I feel this is better than the other live CD, for one thing it's 1/2 the price! Tracks 9, 10, 11 are very good, rock and roll at it's finest! My only regret is that I passed on seeing him in concert at Pine Knob the year it was taped."
4,1912,"A good history book, which led up to President Wilson's election. I think the author is right about that the election of Wilson changed history. However, Wilson's legacy is somewhat discussed. Personally, I think it was 'sad' that he did not get USA to join the Leauge of Nations. The worst thing he 'instituted' was that it was a crime to critize him or his policies. But historians have a favorable look at his presidency today.1912: Wilson, Roosevelt, Taft and Debs--The Election that Changed the Country"
2,"Interesting narrative, but it is unfocused","This book starts off very well, but Chace misses the mark because he lets himself get unfocused. Only about a third to half the book really looked at the election, most of the book discussed life after the election and before the election for the four men. Also, Taft is not discussed as much as Wilson or Roosevelt. However, the pictures are spectacular, and the book is written well."
5,Political history at its very best,"I read 1912 expecting your typical Woodwardesque political history. What I got was probably the best read of the year and one of my favorite works of nonfiction. Not only was 1912 the election that changed America, it also firmly established conservative principles of the Republican party while featuring a cast of four of the most colorful characters ever featured in a presidential election. I was especially impressed with the treatment of Eugene V. Debs, usually overlooked by historians except for the bit of trivia about pulling 1 million votes from prison. I whole-heartedly recommend James Chase brilliant 1912."
4,uuuhhhhh,"this game is great. I played EverQuest for 4 years and I'm gladly moved over to this new game. The graphic art is exceptional and the game play is a new and inventive idea that will hopefully pull, drag, or carry along the other games of it's type out there."
5,Great Product,This has a great book. It gives a good overview of all the missions. There isn't really any more info than you can find on the Wiki site however it is something I can hold in my hand! I like having it in print.
3,Guild Wars: Game Guide,"Is very helpful, but there is a lot missing, and it's hard to find what you're looking for in the book as opposed to the game... The maps are very helpful when you can find the one that applys to the game... I'd like to see an updated version of this book, I would definitely purchase it!!!"
4,Great value,"First of all, Electronic Express did a great job shipping the stereo. I ordered on a Saturday night and received on Wednesday. I've had the stereo a little over a week now and think its an outstanding value. The sound quality is decent (would like to see brighter highs though), and it works well with mp3 players, usb jump drives and CDs (both retail and MP3s burned onto CD). Radio reception is solid too. One feature I'd like to see is a random/shuffle on the CD player, but overall am very happy with it!"
4,LG LF-U850,This player was just what I needed. It even reads my ipod but the order of the files is random.
5,Great desktop stereo,"For the money, this system is hard to beat. Great features. Excellent sound quality."
5,Brilliant!,"A very good production and songs choosen one by one! Old and new fans of Asia, must get this album! If you like ""Aura"" you will just love ""Silent Nation""! Geoff and the Gang are back!"
1,My Own Stupidity,"Why oh Lord do I continue to purchase new Asia releases? Theybore me to tears. There must be something I can do with my$14.99 than keep giving it to this band.I have nothing against them, it's my fault. I find absolutely nothing redeaming in this CD as with the last yet I keep buying them. Good cover, that may be what got me.It has nothing to do with the Asia of the past, I am making nocomparison. This just does nothing for me in any way, shape or form. I can listen to just about anything (Country and Rap not inlcuded) and find something worth keeping. Silent Nation is now being recyled next to a banana peel and some empty beer bottles that were next to the banana peel in the trash.I'm done now with Asia. Thank you and good night."
1,Why doesn't Geoff,"just join another band or try & put the Buggles back together. He had his 2 shots, one with Yes & the other with Asia 20 plus years ago. At least change the name of the band, because everyone harkens back to Heat of the Moment, Only Time Will Tell, & Don't Cry. Is it unfair? Yes. It's still going to happen all the time under the name Asia. Asia's days are long over, here & all over the world. Stop driving the name into the ground & giving once-proud Asia fans something to cringe over. The die-hards rating this thing more than 3 stars need to get with the times & quit blindly following a cool band name & some awesome ancient album artwork. It's over."
1,Too bad the whole CD was not Silent,"This is not an Asia release.Please dont waste your money and ""Asia"" (I use the term loosely since only 1 is a real member) please hang it up!NOT WORTH THE RESOURCES IT TOOK TO MAKE"
2,Not very good,"I got this DVD camera last week as a gift. I tried it for one week and I returned it. There are several reasons:1) The specs might sound good on paper, but not a reality.Picture quality is horrible, both indoors and outdoors. Myhouse is sunny and bright indoors. I took video of my children during the day and it was grainy. I tried it outdoors and it wasn't a sharp picture at all.2) The DVD-RW discs in general loose their quality overtime, and infact may become completly unreadable after 2 years! So, if your planning on saving your children's childhood memories don't buy DVD, use miniDV instead. Just do a search on the computer and you'll find this to be true.3) The hitachi's batteries last about 30 - 45 min! That's it! The video is also 30 min only!4) This particular hitachi does not have the capability of hooking up to your computer."
3,The night shoot was not good.,"The night shoot is not there.ZRs are much better in value and better. They had good review on previous models. I do not understand why some reviewer prefer this one than the Canon-- the reason being Canon Zr lines have no reviews out yet, but this one has practically no reviews at all except his own.5 Stars for this camcorder is ridiculous."
1,Device is a toy,I was told it connected to a computer and I find out later it doesn't. Time for the trash
1,not happy,"was unable to fully use single use disk, after using camera a few minutes was unable to restart to use it again, maybe I should have stayed with a JVC??"
4,Very pleased,My husband and I purchased this camcorder after doing a lot of research. We thought the price was great! So far it has done the job for us. We have 3 kids so it gets a lot of use here. We also took it to Disney and it worked out great because it is so small so taking it on rides or into shows was not a problem at all. We love it and would reccomend it.Also it was not hard to get it going. All you have to do is make sure you read the directions.
4,No Problems with this Item,"I got this camcorder a few years ago and have never had a problem...in fact, I'm quite surprised at all the negative reviews and bad experiences.Maybe I'm just naive, as this was my first and only DVD camcorder so far. I'm not sure about all the features on other products, but I've gotten so used to this camera that it has never been a problem (however, after reading these reviews, I'm knocking on wood!).True, the DVD recording time is not long. True, you have to finalize discs before you take them out. True, you can only finalize through an AC outlet. But for the most part, this camera has served my needs. I guess if you are looking for something more elaborate, you can get something else. But this item works well and serves its purpose."
3,It does work,"I bought this product to cover a few marks on my face, it worked just that the color was off! I have asked the seller about returning the product for a different color and no reply yet so... I will update this once I hear something."
4,Great colander but handle a little loose,"We love this colander and hope it lasts for a long time. Only problem is that the handle was a little loose when it arrived. Not bad, just a little jiggly."
3,colander,it is a nice colander but is smaller than I really expected; depends on your needs but a 5 qt would probably be better.
3,Paint fades,"Though I like this colander overall (it's sturdy and a good size), the paint does tend to fade in spots when you wash it in the dishwasher. And, you know, I'm just not going to bother to wash an everyday cooking tool like this by hand like it was fine china or something."
2,"Paint Bubbles, Peels and Rusts","Beautiful colander. I had it for about 2 months now and the paint started to bubble and peel on the bottom and around each of the holes. after the paint comes up, the colander then starts to rust in the exposed areas. Had to throw it out. I did wash this colander in the dishwasher, so that may have something to do with it."
1,i agree,i agree with who ever wtote the first suggestion. this book was the excat opposite of what i thought it would be
1,"Twice I tried, broken both times","I'm not sure I can give this 0 stars. If it makes me give it 1 star, be forewarned, 0 is the right number. I ordered this product and when it arrived it was evident that the pestle was broken in 2 pieces. The pestle wasn't separately protected. I thought I was just unlucky. I went to the trouble of reordering, sending back the broken one. The replacement came, broken in exactly the same fashion. It was a different set, but equally broken. Buy this elsewhere."
1,Didn't even work out of the box,"I purchased these at Lowe's and they didn't even work out of the box. I had returned them, and bought another. They worked for about 20 hours. Do yourself a favor and avoid these."
5,a safety must,Every store that sells tiki torches should have to display these right next to them. The standard bamboo steak incorporated into the torch is just not safe enough with a flaming bottle of gas wobbling atop a four foot stick.
5,A wondrous journey,"On a long train ride to New York, I consumed Jerry Ellis's wonderful new book in one sitting. From the man who walked a straight line to the squeaky staircase, the stories Ellis tells make the reader feel as if he were along on the pilgrimage too. And a pilgrimage it was as even I, a particularly non-spiritual person, felt moved by the otherworldly aspects of the quest.Further the fact that Chaucer, all these years later, drew Ellis across the Atlantic to make this trek is captivating proof of the universal power of literature. Walking to Canterbury achieves the right balance of the then and now, and I predict that Ellis will introduce thousands to Chaucer who would have never known him."
5,Pleasant Ramble,"I have just finished ""Walking to Canterbury"" and find it a delightful read. As you share the walk with the author, he contrasts present day locations and customs with the distant world of Chaucer in this well flowing account . For this reason, I found the book hard to put down. The historic references were well intertwined, often with humor to show how man has not changed so much in his nature in the intervening centuries. I look forward to reading his other works. (I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Ellis and he is as fascinating in person as his works)"
4,very funny,"Silent comedy, as well as being interesting, can be quite clever, as some of these go far to prove."
4,It's helpful for researching,It's helpful for researching. I am looking for such book for a long time.
2,Spooky Ohio:13 traditional tales,Being from Ohio I knew some of these stories and places so that made it neat. Book is more for childern than adults. My 10 year enjoyed most of the stories but found them not spooky.
2,Not the best intro to the Reivers,I bought this after reading the rave reviews. The voices are grewat but the material seems weak. I should have gone with my normal MO for unfamiliar artists and tried their early works first. Maybe its time to just stop buying CDs altogether and just buy downloads.
3,Where are The Creek Bank Singers?,"From the moment the CD arrived, I realized that something was askew. The only date on the album is 2003, and aside from copyright information about the songs, there's nothing in the CD booklet -- not even a list of the singers. The original LP had different cover art and a gatefold with the lyrics, cast list (The Creek Bank Singers, who were credited as such on the front cover) and photos.When I put the CD in, it was instantly clear that the 25th anniversary edition is ABSOLUTELY NOT the original recording. The case vaguely boasts that it's ""the same gang as before, but this time they are captured on newly re-recorded digital soundtracks."" The songs and narration are the same, but it's like expecting to hear a beloved Beatles album and instead hearing a cover album by The Bootles -- it's the same, but it's not the same."
1,Poor completely new version,"This CD is NOT the original recording. Instead of the folksy, acoustic original, this CD uses mostly synthesized instruments and highly studio-ized vocals and acting. Gone are Dottie Rambo and the real kids. Please re-release the original!!!! Don't bother buying this one."
2,Disappointing - politically tinged,"The author recaps early spy flights, with emphasis on British participation. There is much that is new and interesting. Unfortunately, the author's political views creep into the story as he attempts to prove that USAF leaders wanted to start WWIII. His conclusion that Western spy flights were just too provocative ignores Soviet aggression in areas other than the air war. The thought that the brutal, totalitarian Soviet system maybe deserved to be fought and eventually defeated doesn't seem to have occured to the author."
4,Spyflights of the Cold War,A good starting point for someone interested in the beginning to middle stages of the recon missions\overflights conducted at that time(1945-1960). Also very informative about military personnel involved in the decisions to conduct the overflights.
5,a MUST for any fan of attrition!,"face it- we've all spent money on remix albums and been terribly disappointed with the quality and consistency of the mixes. ""the hand that feeds,"" is NOT one of those disappointments. this is a wonderful album, with each remix building on the original. recommendations are morbus kitahara's mix of ""white men talk"" and chris & cosey's take on ""i am (eternity)"". very good stuff."
2,B sides / Remixes? Anyone?,"One of the more compelling tracks from the better than expected Eurythmics comeback album and a great choice for a single. But why oh why oh why won't someone tap the record company on the shoulder and say ""where are the remixes"", ""where are the non-album tracks"". These recent singles have failed to deliver very much beyond the stock standard album version and another album track and this single has got to be the worst value yet. ""Peace Is Just A Word"" would have been one of the few tracks from the new album that could be shipped off to any number of innovative remixers (Massive Attack could've done a nice job on this) and made this single even remotely of interest to the general public. Let alone a rabid fan like myself!"
2,don't bother,"His background is in Special Forces, not tanks. He should stick to what he knows. He knows nothing about tanks.The first chapters deal with tanks, their vulnerabilities and tank armament. Much of this is very general and not very accurate. He also goes into detail about tank armament. These were the sorts of rumors about tank armament that I commonly heard when I was in the army; it's also wrong.When he discusses infantry tactics, he does a reasonably good job. However, the good points of this book do not make up for the failings."
5,Ako-Mils Parts Drawer,"The Akro-Mils parts drawer is just what I needed to hold all of the little stuff in the garage. It is plenty sturdy and the drawers move in and out nicely. It was a little bit of a pain cutting the drawer separators off of the back, but they are handy to have. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the unit."
1,Beware Hidden Cost,These do not include drawer dividers! The dividers are another $8 for 6 of the large and $10 for 16 of the small . This adds up when buying multiple units. I just sank another $80 into 4 units just to get dividers! For the price of this unit considering it is made completely of plastic the dividers should be included. This is nothing but a hidden cost and I find it deceitful.
4,"Its an organizer, what more can you say?","The shelves are made out of a soft plastic, unlike many of the older crystaline hard plastic organizers but I guess that's what keeps the cost of it down."
2,Need to Return,The drawers are too small. My daughter had asked for this for xmas but did not realize the drawers were so small. How do I return it.
3,Plastic does and plastic is,"It works for it's intended purpose, but it's about as 'plasticy' as a product can get. The product is made of softer and a little more flexible plastic than the 20 year old metal case, plastic drawer unit that it replaced. Hopefully this softer plastic will not break and crack like it's predecessor did. We'll see. As is true for many of it's cousins, don't make the mistake of tipping it forward. You'll have a bunch of drawers in your lap and a sea of screws to pick up and sort out."
5,Excellent Organizer,"I purchased this for my husband to organize about 20 years worth of nuts, bolts, screws, parts and pieces that were littered all over his workbench and storage area. After reading other reviews it sounded like it was a decent size and actually turned out to be even more spacious than expected. The large drawers are big enough to fit wall switch plate covers. It came with some dividers and I easily made more by cutting up some cardboard from the shipping box. Everything is now conveniently in its place. This was an excellent value purchase."
3,Nice storage chest,"The chest is well made, and the drawers slide easily. The big disadvantage is that of the dividers that are provided, only the long ones work with the drawers, and only four are provided for the 24 drawers. Otherwise, it's a good chest."
4,Great Quick Reference,Great used book and a handy reference for reptiles in my area of Florida. Would recommend for anyone wanting a quick reference and not needing a lot of detail.
4,There are some pricey ingredients in this book.,"I have loved every receipe I have tried. They do as they promise. The receipies are easy and fun to create. The receipies are also in small portions easily doubles or tripled. But, just to warn you; some(not all) of the ingredients required in this book are somewhat expensive."
1,Too basic!,"This book is just too basic. Probably intended for elementary or high school students. If you're thinking of seeing stuffs like Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate, Methyl Paraben, ..... etc. This book is definitely not for you!"
2,I wish there was a craft book with SIMPLE ingredients.,"I decided to check this book out at a bookstore first, because I have gotten so many craft books that sound really great, but the materials and ingredients needed are very exotic or expensive. This book is no exception. Although the recipes and ideas are simple and easy, the essential oils needed (which are NOT cheap, mind you.) and the other array of items (that no one keeps in their house) would cost a fortune.Her other book, ""Natural Beauty at Home"", is a MUCH better book, with the same easy and simple instructions, and realistic materials. Ideas like oatmeal masks, potpurri, and soap that are not hard to do, and not pricey. I highly recommend this one over ""Natural Beauty for All Seasons""."
2,Misleading,"I didn't care for this book. I have several (home-made toiletries) books and I was dissapointed in this one. There should have been more recipes that incorporate the use of 'raw' natural materials OTHER than food. Food is extremely perishable. There ARE natural preservatives available on the market (Vit E, Grapefruit Seed Extract, Germaben II) that could have been utilized to come up with many good recipes. I also didn't like the fact that castor and mineral oils were used in some of the recipes, as these will clog up pores tremendously. In the Gift-Giving section, her ideas were good, though I would have liked to have seen some actual recipes and step-by-step instructions on the creations of these ideas. All in all, I give this book a 2-star rating. There ARE a few recipes in here that I will use, but hardly worth the price of that I payed. I could have had a better response via the search engines on the internet and saved the money."
5,Must have!,"I love this book, it has cutting edge business communication and english empowering illustrations."
2,Not Satisfied,Well I needed a cheaper equalizer and this seemed viable being as I use a boss amp etc. but when I hooked it up it buzzes rediculously and can't get it to stop. Buying some filters and stuff tomorrow to hopefully fix it.
4,boss ava 1204,this eq is preatty good.i got it conectted with a4000 watts mono class d lanzar.a alpine v12 with a boss radio 9962 dvd tv radio with a kicker l5 for bass.for high some pumch and mirange i got alpine and it sound good good bass the voice sound clear.
4,this looks good,I have just played this game at the game store and it was great! The down side was it was difficalt. Of course I was tring to learn the controlls on my own. I am deffently getting this game!
2,Mis-led Gamer,"When I first saw the description and the reviews of this game, it sounded awesome. But, being the cautious type, I first rented it. It is pretty monotonous in the fact you get up every morning and the landlady yells at you to go to work. then you go there and get an assingment.After every battle you're in, you get a new part, but you never get those ""illegal"" parts you heard were so awesome. Once you beat Rahu, there is Not much to do.This is not a challenging game; and, in my opinion, is not worth $40 for a game that takes you 6 hrs. to beat. If you want a nice, easy game for one weekend, this is your game to RENT. If you want a challenging game, get something else."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!,The only good thing about this stupid game is one-player mode. When i played multiplayer mode i expected it to be first person. Everything is so dang tiny!! PLus the boards are really tiny too!
4,Cool Game,"""I like this game, it's cool"", that's what my son said about the game he's 14 and a gamer."
4,Coolest game ever!,I like this game alot! It's packed with cool weapons and custom bodies like you see as Megazords in the power ranger series.
2,A picture is worth a thousand words,"I have an '84 900 turbo, and I found that this manual left a lot to be desired. As I've found with a lot of Haynes manuals (this is my fourth), this manual is missing a lot of details. For instance, what is that cylinder in the front left fender well? I finally had to search through junk yards to determine that the flexible hose from the air filter does not actually connect to an exhuast port, but just wraps around the exhaust manifold. I really wish the under the hood/car views had better resolution and were more detailed. Finally, the manual often just says ""see photos"" instead of refering to specific photos. I get the impression this one was rushed to print."
2,Only really useful for the most technically inclined,"If you're seeking a useful manual for your Saab 900 or 900 Turbo, this probably isn't what you want. This is a VERY technical technical manual, useful only for those already comfortable with building/rebuilding and servicing engines."
3,dont like the way i got it,"when i got the movie you can tell the movie was loose inside, this is a christmas gift and when they open it most likely its going to be all scratched from it being loose inside. !!!!!!!"
5,Superb ethnograhic account of advertising agency practice,"I could not recommend this book highly enough for students of advertising and consumer culture. It is a really insightful, insider account of the work of advertising agencies and practitioners,and while the tone of writing is definitely academic, this book has much to offer practitioners within the field to reflect upon their work. I found this book having completed ethnographic fieldwork within an advertising agency, and I could relate to much of what many of the authors within the text desribed in their own accounts of agency practice. This text should be essential reading for all students of advertising and integrated marketing communications, as well as marketing and advertising practitioners alike, and is a much welcomed new perspective on advertising production."
4,Good Action/RPG for NeoGeo Pocket Color,"Dark Arms (Beast Busters '99), despite the rather questionable name, provides a very enjoyable action/rpg experience (similar to, say, Zelda). Perhaps the funnest part of the game is 'growing' and 'evolving' your weapons. The graphics are excellent, as is the gameplay - although the game is somewhat short. Great for rpg fans, as there are very few rpgs out for the NeoGeo Pocket Color..."
4,A Good Showcase of Their Style & Attitude,"I liked listening to Dr. Hook when they were at the peak of their popularity. Their sense of humor and irreverence constituted so much of their appeal. That attitude shines through on several of the songs on this album. While I don't enjoy every single song, there are enough that I really do like to make it well worth the price."
2,Dissapointed,"I admit I was impressed by the table of contents of this book, and I admit I had no previous experience with the subject, but sure with the 'real life' of support services for a database company. Most of the book is devoted to review commercial software available on the market and for me, this is just enough to be dissapointed. There are better commercial magazines or even websites can provide you this information for free... Although some formulas and templates looks very interesting (that's why 2 stars), maybe should you consider a help desk book instead."
5,Great toy!,"My son loves this toy, its been wonderful for his teething. It was delivered promptly. Will order from this site again."
4,Curve Balls,"""Gigantic"" offers a mix of experiences. From the opening credit where the title is in a small font, one knows that this is a film that throws curve balls. One never quite knows what to expect. Paul Dano who was so good in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" also produced. He turns in a subtle performance as Brian Weathersby who sells mattresses and works to secure his life-long dream of becoming an adoptive parent to a Chinese child. A complication arises as he meets Harriet ""Happy"" Lolly played by Zooey Deschanel. Shopping for a mattress, she falls asleep on the bed. From there a friendship and unusual romance develops. Ed Asner has a nice cameo as Brian's father. Jane Alexander turns in an excellent cameo performance as Brian's mother. John Goodman is blustery and eccentric as Harriet's father. The performances are all first rate. Enjoy!"
1,Great Potential! Falls Flat!,"I wondered how Paul Dano landed the starring roll in this. He's just an annoying moper throughout. He's the Executive producer! He put up the cash to make it. A story that could have gone any number of ways, goes nowhere. Great characters and acting from everyone but Dano. Always beware of movies that the star bankrolls. It nearly always means no one else wants to invest. And for good reason here."
1,Something's rotten in the state of .........,"Where to start !!!!! An appalling overhyped load of cobblers . I am beginning to think the other reviewers must have watched a different movie to the one I endured. Boring stupid and a total waste of time and talent. You will be lucky to crack a grimace let alone laugh out loud. There is one redeeming feature and that is the luminous beauty of the young female star,Zooey Deschanel. She is a knockout!!!!"
2,"Try as they might, nothing interesting happens","I was intrigued by this movie because I enjoyed the lead couple respectively from their quirky work in Little Miss Sunshine / Yes Man. I've seen half the movie thus far and this movie wants to be quirky and off-beat but doesn't deliver. Most disappointingly, it delves into the tired subjects of sex and drugs with shallow treatment. Also, the dialogue in the movie is flat and uninspired. It's particularly annoying how several individuals in the movie are supposedly doctor level education but use the vernacular of sophmoric losers. Paul Dano's desire to adopt a chinese baby is an attempt at cutey-quirky that really lacks authenticity. J. Goodman and E. Asner also have parts that don't sum-up and act them in an exaggerated style for pure spectacle. Too bad independent movies at times can't be more independent, but seem bent on copying some well-worn vibe of outsider cool. Thumbs down."
1,This is NOT a paperback textbook!,"What Amazon neglects to inform you on this page is that this book is actually the *STUDY GUIDE* for the hardcover textbook, not the textbook in paperback form. Buyer beware!!"
2,Geosystems,"I purchased this book used. When it arrived, i noticed that it had a distinct smell of cat odor. Other than that, the book was in good condition."
4,Unplugged Cale,"This is really very good. John Cale is not a showman so don't buy this DVD if you're expecting that sort of thing.What you do get is a good musician performing some of his best material alone at the Piano or Guitar. Stripping away some of the elbaorate arrangements of Cale's songs helps you to concentrate on whats important in the songs.The concert was recorded in Brussells in the early 90's the DVD has fifteen tracks on it, including ""Paris 1919"" and ""Dying of the vine"".This well worth getting."
3,This dvd gets stuck,The dvd gets stuck during the first song. I'm disappointed. The performance and content are terrific but I can only give this a fair review.
4,I bought this for the first song.,"I had heard the song Chain before, and liked it, so I wanted to buy it. The other two songs on the CD are nice as well, and I understand it is an import, just seemed a bit high priced ($14 at the time) for only 3 songs, but it just comes down to whether or not you think it is worth it too you."
5,An Excellent Read,Matthew Pinson's treatment of this volatile subject was balanced and informative. I would recommend it to others who would like to study this issue or have questions concerning eternal security.
4,"Excelente,y encendida preciosa......",He quedado muy satisfecho con la compra y el vendedor me ha parecido muy legal.
4,Great clutching toy,"I got this because my son is at the stage where he puts everything in his mouth (he's 8 months old). I wanted a product that could be tiny enough to bring everywhere, keep him entertained and would be non-toxic if he were to use it as his new teether. This is a great size for my son to hold and play with. The body is held together by a an elastic string that stretches the toy out if it's being pulled at both ends which makes it great for a ""clutching"" toy and the eyes and hands are parts easy for putting in the mouth. It gives me peace of mind that the paint is made of non-toxic paint especially for babies that are constantly putting everything in their mouth. It is definitely smaller than I thought but still a great toy."
3,arms seem dangerous,"arms seemed like infant could easily chew through connecting cord whle teething and free wooden ball on end. felt this was potential choking hazard, so we cut arms off. infant still enjoys without arms, but seemed like a big design flaw for such a pricey small toy."
4,Very nice clutching toy,"I bought this and the moby toy and didn't realize I was getting practically the same type of toy (clutching toy) but just two different animals. I don't consider this a ""rattle"" because well..it doesn't! The wood just makes a claking noise as it is shaken back and forth (not very easily by a baby) and it's just as much of a ""teether"" than the moby is and for that matter any toy. Don't get me wrong it is a very cute clutching toy but I was expecting to get exactly what it says a ""wooden teether and rattle"""
2,Dont waste your money,"I bought these for my border collie for the 4th of July, these calming pills don't work. Don't waste your money, Didn't help at all.would have worked better putting earmuffs on the dog."
1,Quieting pills for dogs,"Did not quiet my dog and she did not care for its flavor, so had to disguise it in many ways."
2,Worthless on German Shepherd,"I have an INSANE German Shepherd that paces, 'air snaps', whines and howls non-stop. Its beyond irratating. We will be flying him on a 14hr flight and I bought these pills to keep him from ripping his kennel to shreds and roaming the cargo bay of the plane. He ALWAYS tears out of his kennel and hurts himself severly...even with zip ties. Needless to say, at 2 pills nothing...still paces & bites the kids when they move. 3 pills he lays down occasionally when NOTHING in the house moves...but as soon as the kids move an inch he is up scratching, grunting and being annoying. I'm worried to increase the dose more. He is only 65lbs. But I'm thinking for the flight we will give him 5 pills. *shakes head*"
4,Works great for mild to moderate anxiety,"My dog has a fear of trucks, which has generalized into a fear of walking down the road and of riding in the car. This product lessens her anxiety enough for me to get her attention to give her treats and train her. Before, she was far too scared, shaking, and refused food/treats. She didn't have an all-out panic attack, so I'd classify her as moderate anxiety. Now she's okay, and we're finally making progress with her fear. It doesn't remove the anxiety totally, but it is noticeably better and fading as we can train and desensitize.It doesn't make her tired or lethargic like a sedative, just less anxious. I give her 3 tabs (she's 105 pounds) 30 minutes to an hour before we work.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the taste that my dog isn't so fond of. The pills are crumbly and break easily to mix with a little wet food, so that's how we do it."
3,It's a nice puzzle.,"I bought it for my son as a Christmas present. I'm sure he'll like it, but I can't say it'll make it under the tree. It looks complete. I do like the art style of the puzzle itself, and decoder is present. I'd give it a 5 star if the box weren't crushed, and frayed to the point it looks like it was a substitute soccer ball. I suppose it still is as advertised 'very good' condition for a used puzzle."
3,Devil's Island,"I've enjoyed listening to and reading John Hagee over the years, but I'm waiting on him to write a hands on real-to-life story like this novel that was highly recommended to me called ""Waiting to Exit Hell."" THAT IS A BEST SELLER AND GOOD BOOK!"
2,Someone should have spoken,"2 1/2Starts off as a reasonably strong follow up to the emotional Brit-boys well received debut with well sung vocals complimenting simple but effective guitar-and-piano arrangements, but takes a progressive nosedive after the fourth track and never really recuperates from a mediocrity prevalent in their saturated production coupled with blatant songwriting limitations."
3,Silence Is Easy,"It just all seems a little TOO easy. Starsailor's James Walsh has an emotive and embracing voice, but the music and lyrics never really justify the anguish. Even when the tunes hit home - the Phil Spector-produced title track, Some Of Us, Four To The Floor - the schoolboy sentiments deny the songs any real emotional intensity. Born Again is the best track here, and even then it struggles to match Coldplay or even David Gray for clout. That said, Silence Is Easy is no major backward step from the debut and deserves to be heard above many of the so-called 'trendier' new bands. Expect a better third album."
4,Cute doll,Cute doll a little darker than shows and small but the colors are nice and it's easy to wash.
4,My second order,"I like these gloves, although they don't last me long, the thumbs seem to wear out quickly, other than that they are a very good general purpose garden glove."
3,Not very durable,"I do manual labor everyday and I bought these because my company stopped furnishing dot gloves for the employees. They fit very well but do not last as long as I had hoped. During a busy week they will not last the entire week, but the last few weeks have been slow and I am still using the same pair, so as I said, an OK glove."
5,"Shut up, Withnail! Of course he's the fcuking farmer!","I'd seen this movie about twenty times when i received the screenplay as a gift. I wasn't expecting to laugh much, or even read it, having memorized the script, but i was very much mistaken. Reading the screenplay was a completely different experience than watching the movie; robinson's writing is delicious. It's also amazing to see what the extrodinary cast took and turned into the film. Their preformances seem all the more impressive. I'd recomnend this to long-time fans, one-veiwers and non-veiwers alike. Truly a modern masterpiece."
1,I would love to review this item...,"...but I can't since Amazon doesn't seem to be able to fill my order for it. I love the movie, and I was really looking forward to reading the screenplay, but Amazon keeps telling me that there are ""delays"" -- and not sending the product to me.It's a book, but it sure seems like vaporware."
4,Laxatone Order,We've used this product for several years and found it to be effective. We would prefer the metal tube shown in the picture to the plastic tube. The metal tube can be completely emptied.
5,THE BEST CHRISTMAD CD EVER MADE!!!,"I got this on cassette way back in it's ""early days"". I was so thrilled to see it released in CD. It is heart warming, loving and brings the holiday home to your heart where it belongs. So forget the hustle and bustle of the season, put on this CD, light a fire, uncork the wine and snuggle up on the sofa with someone you love!!! This is a must have for EVERYONE who celebrates the season! Way to go, Cris!!!!"
5,All Too Familiar -- Unfortunately,"""Institutionalized"" is a slaphappy journey into the corporate world of Byzantine politics, incomprehensible language, and delusional programs. Into this all-too-familiar scene, enter our hero, Lance, a new executive of Institutionalized Industries. Hired by a CEO who was non compos mentis at the time, Lance is a clear-headed entrepreneur and a natural enemy of the status quo. The war is on! Who wins? Ah, well, for that you have to read the book...."
1,do not buy this comforter!,"This comforter is a dud. It is advertised light weight because there is such a minimal amount of down. The cover is not white it is grey. It may have baffle box construction but the edges are cheaply made (not gusseted as would be expected on baffle box construction). This would have been our 3rd comforter in 43 years. Our 1st 2 were beautiful, plump, soft treasures and I was very excited about getting number 3 but now I am just very annoyed. I had it shipped 1-2 days shipping (not cheap) and now I have to send it back plus they do not honor Amazon Prime Shipping Think this time I am just going to buy from a Name Brand REPUTABLE company. If this is ""Warm Things"" Supremium, that being the best they have, we don't need them. Pacific Coast and Lands End make a beautiful product...may look at them again and The Company Store is very good also. Don't make the same mistake I did-"
5,Great birthday gift!,"My dear sister Heather gave me this book for my birthday. I am an avid internet dater, so this was the perfect gift for me. I guess the best word to summarize Cosmo Fox's book would be: CAPTIVATING. I couldn't put the book down! The next day, I dropped the book off to one of my friends that has been having hazardous dates. I would completely recommend purchasing this book and give it a FULL FIVE STARS! Know someone who chats and dates online? ""Online Dating: The Early Years"" should be their next birthday gift! Thanks, Cosmo."
2,when are we gonna hear something a bit different,"I may not be the biggest DTTB fan in the world, but this album does nothing for me I'm afraid. The band seem to be relentlessly treading the same old path used by the last two albums, which isn't a good thing in my book. I think that although you'll probably happily tap your feet (or foot for those less fortunate) to a lot of this album, its instantly forgettable, as though a computer has seemlessly programmed the 'funk' & 'groove' into each piece with soul-less precision. I had heard that although the live band are quite good - and live(?) the studio side of this project is largely down to computers, so maybe that won't surprise those of us with a need for organic grooviness. In my summing up I'd say yeah, go buy, but don't wait for any surprises - maybe we'll get an album of remixes to stop counteract this output of jazzmuzak lethargy!"
1,What were they thinking?,"First of all, I have been a HUGE Down to the Bone fan ever since I first heard a track of theirs a few years ago. Seeing them live at the Old Pasadena Jazz Fest was one of the highlights of the summer of '03. With that, I have to say -- what were they thinking? This CD sounds like they got tired of the whole thing, turned on the synthesizers and left the room, no, the building. Monotonous. Stale. Wow. Why? Any of their other CDs blows this one out of the water. Try ""Manhattan to Staten"" and ""Crazy Vibes & Things."""
3,Not Funky Enough,"I found that this CD did not live up to its title. DTTB's later CD, Spread Love Like Wildfire, is much funkier (despite its title, which would lead you to believe that its tracks are all love songs). The tracks on Not Funky Enough all seem to have the same disco beat and the horn lines are very repetitive. In short, I found this CD to be on the boring side."
5,:),"I grew up with McKay, and his book highlights points in his life that all of us in the graduating class of HHS '05 will never forget (or let him forget). Perhaps it is because I grew up with him that makes the book so good in my opinion. Perhaps it is a biased opinion. But whatever it is, I applaud McKay for his writings and his ambitions. His humor is natural, his self-depreciation unnecessary. And to Brian, I do not notice a spelling mistake on the first page."
5,Statin drugs and their natural alternatives,"Very informative. This book is a ""must read"" for anyone using statin drugs. Side effects may not be noticed when first taking statins, but damage done is sometimes not reversible. Knowledge on dosage and how they are determined is a ""must know""for both doctors and patients which this books gives in much detail."
4,"Essential information for patients, about statin drugs","""Statin Drugs & Their Natural Alternatives"" is a must read for anyone using statins or who may use them in the future. Even though prescribed by a doctor, statins are not always safe. They can result in many undesirable side effects. Doctors don't tell you about all the side effects when they prescribe statins, it's just easy for them to prescribe statin drugs so they do it. The dangers and consequences become the problem of the patient, not the doctor. Protect yourself by reading this book."
2,ups and downs,"The circle part of this devices works perfectly. The majoy flaw is in the ""pen"". THe pen is, honestly, a peice of plastic junk. I do not typically write harsh reviews, but this thing is bad. The pen does not hold the blades well and breaks very easily. If the per were made of metal of some sort this would be a far better product."
1,Worst buy,"This did not work at all and although didn't cost much, you pay for what you get with this one...I immediately went and spent the money on a good circle cutter and trashed this one! I saw it on an info-mercial and they made it look so easy to use but really the blades broke off immediately and it didn't make one straight circle....don't waste even a dollar on this."
2,EK Circle Scissors,I recently bought this item and am a little disappointed with it. I've used it only once and already one blade is broken and I haven't had time to enjoy using it.Can anyone tell me where i can get replacement blades please. I think I might need to buy a few.
2,Circle scissor review,I own this and find it difficult to use. The idea seems simple enough but it slips easily and you have to press fairly hard to turn the plastic to cut out your circle. Still looking for something that gives many size choices and is easier to use.
5,Undeniably the best guide!,"Lance Cutler provides a witty, personal guide to tequila and mezcal - not just the drinks, but to the industries, the regions, the people and the cultures. Part travelogue, part research, the book meanders between serious study of the spirits, and playful retelling of his many trips into Mexico's heartlands. The inclusion of mezcal in the latest edition should help to open more eyes to the traditional liquor of Mexico. Very enjoyable to read and easily the best book on the subject. Highly recommended!"
5,Best Tequila and Mezcal Information Ever!!!,"What's the difference between tequila and mezcal? This book explains it all. Cutler says it's not a travel guide, but sure make me want to go to Jalisco and Oaxaca and follow his easy to understand, detailed suggestions for tours, restaurants, shopping - the works.Gene D."
2,this case,this is a good case if you like things made out of paper mache. it does work as a case but a very crappy one that is made of paper mache and painted black. did i say that this is a piece of crap case and youre better off spending the extra money for a case with some integrity. dont let the picture fool you this case SUCKS.
1,junk,This case is JUNK! I returned it and purchased a much better lightweight reinforced softshell case with many more features and completely professional construction for a couple of dollars more. AVOID!
3,"Good case, but missing inner padding","I've got a 5 string Framus banjo and I really needed a case because I live on an island and the sea blast was blasting away at the strings and steel parts.So it's perfect for protecting it from that, but I was very disappointed that there was no cushy inner padding for when I am travelling with the banjo. So there is nothing to prevent her from shaking up when I'm on the road. I don't think there was any photograph of the inside of the case on Amazon, so when I purchased it online, I just assumed that it was padded on the inside.I've owned several guitars and cases and this is the first time I've bought a hardshell case that did not have a padded inside... It fits in the case well, with a little extra room, but because there's no padding I'm only giving it 3 stars."
2,Very cheap,This is a VERY cheap thin cardboard case. It doesn't have any cushion inside to keep my banjo from bouncing around. I would not recommend this case.
5,Hot Summer Nights,"Like the reviewer below, I was surprised to find that this entry in the Beach Houses series was much different than ones in the past. It's still great though! It's got a more chilled out feel to it, for poolside listening, or just laying around. There's definately some highlights. The second disc picks up with a few dance numbers. Old favorites like Bonnie Bailey, Kaskade, Stonebridge, Late Night Alumni, Peyton and more make appearances on this two disc set."
5,A frank autobiography of an amazing life.,"Sir Rudolph Bing is most famous for running the New York Metropolitan Opera House through the '50s, 60's, and into the '70's. In this time he witnessed some of the most amazing opera the world has ever seen. Of course the book does not start there. Bing had lived a full life before even signing on at the Met. I found this book to be very well-written. Sir Rudolph Bing's personality really shows through in his writing. If you are at all interested in opera, life during the World Wars or just hearing about the flaws of world famous celebrities, I highly recommend this. - David C."
1,Junk,"Like others, I bought this being that LG has a good rep. But the washer just plain rots.Racks are impossible to load all the dishes, after 6 months the washer leaves everything soaking wet. Had a repairman out and he said it was the rinse agent setting. Changed that to full setting, still wet dishes.I would not recommend this to my worst enemy. An expensive way to learn a lesson.I did not review it at all. I took the word of the salesman in Home Depot.Do NOT buy this."
1,Be prepared to wash by hand - Just Not Dependable,"Have had the dishwasher 3 years now. The door leaked 3 times in the first year, all covered by warranty. It takes 5 - 10 days for each in home repair. Since warranty ended the door leaked again, and an internal hose leaked flooding the kitchen floor. Both of these repairs I paid for, around $100 each. Today the control panel smells like it burnt up, and the unit stopped running. That part looks like it is covered under warranty, but the labor will not be. Looks like it is time to part ways with this, as I feel like I am tossing good money after bad.As far as performance, the best thing about the unit, it looks great, and is super quiet when running. The racks don't load very well compared to a Maytag. The dishes don't always dry.Conclusion: Add LG to the list of banned household appliances, just not made to last."
1,disapointment!,"If you are looking for music,dont bother with this DVD.It is mostly the rantings of some obscure critic with the ocasional floyd member speaking from some BBC radio program or tv show.There is a reason there is no list of tracks on this DVD,there are none! SAVE YOUR MONEY! this will be in the 3.99$ discount pile at your favorite market soon enough!"
1,Very bad quallity,"The information is very good, but the video and the audio quallity is so bad. I don't like it at all. We are in the XXI century. I don't accept this kind of work."
5,"Wonderful Story, Good Quality, Fast Shipping","This is one of my favorite books to read to my little ones. My 4 year old has asked to read ""Alice and Greta"" every day since it arrived. She loves replacing ""Alice"" with her name and ""Greta"" with mine. We talk about which witch does the right and wrong, and we try to decide what Greta should have done instead. It's a great way to discuss right and wrong with preschoolers. I highly recommend this book!"
5,The Brewmerang Principle.......,"Alice and Greta is a delightful book written by Steven J. Simmons. As you can read from the other reviews, it is about two witches who choose to behave differently, one doing good deeds and one doing bad deeds. The Brewmerang Principle is the main theme here, telling the witches that whatever you do will come back to you. My four year old granddaughter LOVES this book. The illustrationsby Cyd Moore are vibrant and wonderful! This book has been a wonderful way to teach my young granddaughter that good deeds return good deeds to her. She talks about being like Alice and doing good things for people. If you are looking for an entertaining book with a great moral lesson, this is it!! I have just discovered the other books in the series and am going to buy them today!! Thanks for a wonderful book!!"
4,Great Starter!,"Parents looking for a great introduction to counting? 1 2 3, repeat after me-- Buy this book! Its easy to grasp format and bright colors make this wonderful book appealing to everyone. Even to children."
4,Small but potent,"I originally bought this book for a report in one of my Recording Industry classes and found that it was a pretty good read. Buy it, check it out from the library or borrow from a friend, anyone in the biz should read it to get a glimpse of how much power the little labels have - and maybe you can help influence the big labels to 'see the light' that mass production and high sells don't mean you are releasing good product; however 'good' is in the eye of the beholder as they say. Think of all your favorite artists, the ones that really did something, the ones that made the history books..more times than not they started at a small label, became well-known then either the big labels copied them with similar acts or the big labels waved lots of cash in their faces to entice them over. If it wasn't for the small labels giving more freedom to artists I'd bet we'd all be spoon-fed the likes of ""How much is that doggy in the window"" from the days of conformity."
4,Little labels--Big dreams,This little book tells some big stories about a time before the major corporations destroyed the music. It is the history of heros and tyrants of some of the most important independent record companies ever. Without them recorded music would have never been the same. Some of the stories are a little dry but others are brillant. A good read for anyone interested in the history of records and modern music
1,Attack on Pearl Harbor,The puzzle was not bought with the understanding that it was used. It was supposed to have been a gift. The box is opened and tattered. I would hate to spend hours putting togther a puzzle to find that pieces are missing.
3,"Not bad, but nothing special either","Robert Kirkman, better known as the creator of the brilliant and riveting Walking Dead for Image Comics, gets to weave some super hero shenanigans with his re-booted Marvel Team-Up. The first storyarc finds Spider-Man and Wolverine teaming up and taking on a murderous, mutant teen with some interesting abilities, and as the book goes on we get to see Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Strange team up, along with Iron Man and the Hulk to boot. Kirkman's dialogue is sometimes witty, but his stories are nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before. His use of an evil, alternate reality Iron Man is pretty nifty though, and the interplay between Spidey and Wolverine is nicely handled as well. Scott Kolins' artwork is solid throughout as well, albeit a bit too cartoony at spots. All in all, Marvel Team-Up: The Golden Child is a nice ode to the original series from the 70's, and it's worth a look for those craving safe and harmless super hero action."
4,Not My Favorite Robot Book But...,"This is more for the Asimov lovers rather than a separate good read. If you were into any of his other books or enjoyed the others in the Robot Series, then I recommend this. If you are new to Asimov, I recommend Caves of Steel first"
5,The Return of Asimov,"Well, here it is: the final robots mystery starring Baley and Daneel. Personally, I think this falls to second or third place in the trilogy, with The Naked Sun as first place. This is in no way a knock of the book, mind you. This book's plot is more involved, making the mystery aspect even tougher to solve. I had thought of the solution, but never given it any thought. This novel takes place on Aurora, the main Spacer world. Its a pleasent mix--not population saturated like Earth, but not robot city like Solaria. My only sort of complaint--sometimes it seemed a bit too long. However, when I finished it, I wished it was longer. Go figure. Now that this novel is done, and Baley has solved his final case, there is only one place to go-- Robots and Empire"
1,The Worst Robot Book.,"I liked the previous two robot books. This one is different. It was written many years later and is not nearly as good as the other ones. It is also vulgar, as Isaac's later books tend to be. It was so bad and vulgar that I didn't even finish it."
2,"As a science fiction story, this is pretty good.","As a mystery/whodunnit, it is horrible. Many of the reviewers here have commented on how difficult it was to anticipate the ending; of COURSE it was difficult; that's becuase the ending made no sense; worse, there was a perfectly logical, elegant solution to the mystery that was completely ignored simply for the purpose of jamming in a deus ex machina that would tie in to some of Asimov's other stories. And worse yet, it would have been possible to use the elegant solution as a part of the deus ex machina, if he really HAD to have that tie-in, and it would have made perfect sense.I can't explain here what that ""elegant solution"" is without giving away the book's ending, an unpardonable crime when reviewing a mystery, but if you're curious (and have read the book) feel free to e-mail me and I'll let you know what I think."
1,Tedious and Flat... Wish I had those 400+ pages back...,"I had to write a review somewhere after reading this book. After reading the Caves of Steel, I thought it would be an enjoyable read. However, it was not. This was the most tedious, long-winded, horribly written piece of snot that I have ever laid my eyes on. Asimov spends way too much time saying the exact same thing over and over as if the reader were completely illiterate. The plot is horribly stupid, and non of the interactions seem 'real' at all. save your time and reread the Foundation series... This book sucked."
5,"asimov, science fiction, novel",Excellent merchandise and service. Pleased to find this novel that I have wanted for a long time.
4,"Third Book in the ""Robot Murder Trilogy""","Decent book, I give it a B-. It is twice as big as either of the prequels in The Robot Murder Series, ""The Caves of Steel"", and ""The Naked Sun"". Unfortunately, The Robots of Dawn isn't as good as either of those two. One of the problems were the number of editorial errors (typos, syntactical errors, etc.) - I remember counting at least six or seven. The other problem is that ""The Caves of Steel"" is Asimov's premiere work, and much of Asimov's other work pales in comparison. All three books can now be found in a 3-in-1 ""Trilogy"", which might be the best way to go for some folks."
5,Story vs Time,I've always enjoyed reading Asimov. I just never had the time (or the assistance of a kindle) to read everything!
2,NATURAL COLOR???????? NO!!,"If you can put on calamine lotion and it matches your skin perfectly this may actually be your color. I would never think that ""light biege"" is pink, but that is just me I guess. I don't know about the other colors, but you may want to call before you order because as costumer service says ""light biege IS pink"". They are impossible to get ahold of through email so you have to call them and wait on hold, until they are ready to help you. And then you have to pay for shipping AGAIN to send it back and EVENTUALLY they will replace it or refund it."
4,Great replacement,Works great small and compact. Much better then the big long ones you have to buy at Sears and half the cost. I needed a replacement as I had to literally get out of my car and stand in front of the door to get it to open my garage with my old one. This one works from about 2 houses down the road.
3,"Good, but way too short.","I was disappointed by the length of this video. It's about 30 minutes and what's provided is good. But, for the price, I don't feel I got my money's worth"
2,Mother of Pearl bracelet,The bracelet is okay. It isn't as shiny as the one pictured in the photo. I guess I got $5 worth. It did arrive in a reasonable amount of time.
5,Early George Jones!,"George Jones is a honky tonk hero. His music is legendary. He is a jukebox legend, and he is still widely popular, even today. And, in 2000, he was given an installment in UMG's '20th Century Masters' series.Unlike many George Jones sets, this focuses strictly on his early years on the Mercury label, spanning 1955-1967. These sides are mighty fine, although many people prefer the Columbia sides of the 1970s and 1980s.How does this collection measure up? Read on.Positives-EVERY MAJOR MERCURY HIT IS HERE! 'Why Baby Why,' 'Color Of The Blues,' 'Who Shot Sam,' and 'Family Bible' all make appearances on here.-The sound quality is superb!NegativesNone.If you like George Jones, than you'll like this set. Highly recommended for any George Jones fan!ENJOY!!!"
3,"great songs, poor value","You can't argue with the greatness of any of the dozen songs here. But you can gripe with the fact that at a scant 30 minutes, this is a poor compilation even at a budget price. Look elsewhere for an introduction to the Sinatra of country."
1,The worst of the puppet master series,Don't see this movie on any accounts.You dont need to see this to know more about the puppet master series.Waste of time and money
4,WHy I love the Puppet Master Movies :-),"Though I belive that curse of the puppet master, the 6th video in the set was not that well made, the entire series as a whole has been one of my favoite since I first watched them. This boxed set of 8 DVD's contains the many adventures of a team of puppets that have been brought to life by the Original Puppet Master Andre Tulon. Each movie continues on with the puppets adventures as they gain new Masters. Some of the Puppet Masters are good, and others are evil, but regardless of their master's intentions the puppets cary out their wishes using the special deadly talents that each one was designed with. Unfortunatly for the last several years many of the films in this series have been out of print, but now they have all be released in this great dvd set that I think every horror film lover should buy."
2,OK for a B movie,"I'm not a Puppet Master guru like some of the other reviewers, but I thought the story line was OK.Pro: Emily Harrison is cute.Con: the ending sucked. It's as if the writer rushed to end the story."
2,Small and flimsy,This looks a lot more durable in the picture. I wanted it for the garage but it is so lightweight and flimsy I am going to have to think of somewhere to use it inside.
3,About the things sisters share,"My sister bought me this book when I was 20 and she was 16. Now I read it to my 2 year old, who has a new baby sister. The two year old loves hearing about the things sisters have in commona and the things they don't."
1,dirty & torn,"Right out of the box, I noticed the book's cover is torn on the binding and the bottom half looks like someone dropped it in mud or spilled something on it."
4,gift for great-grnd-daughters,"It is always risky to buy books you have not read for others. Going on how popular it is, I can say about this book that the 3-year-old with a new baby sister to deal with has found it one of her favorites."
3,Not his best,"This album was sort of a dissapointment for me. I found many of the album's tracks to be just average at best. ""Que le den vitminas"" is a good (not great) song. ""Espera Turno"" is a rather enjoyable bolero/guracha very Cuban-isque. ""La Cosita"" ruins the albums for me (as does any merengue in my case). The best song is unarguably ""El Montunero"" and ""Tumba Brava"" has it's moments. Overall the album is not a must-have, unless you're a die-hard collector like me, you're not missing out on anything special. It's a true shame because Hector Casanova is a great singer and I usually enjoy most songs with Pacheco on chorus."
1,Don't get this one,You can buy the whole Ring Cycle from which this is taken for the same price as this single opera right here on amazon.com. It's published by Opera D'Oro with good sound and reliable quality discs and is readily available on this site. Enjoy!
2,L* A* M* E,"Things started getting a tad nauseating 'round the 4077th in season 8, what with the recycled storylines (""War Co-Respondant"" -- just cheat on Peg already, B.J.! Get it over with!), and cheap sentimentality (""Too Many Cooks"" -- Just divorce him already, Mildred!). Add to that the painful chore of having to watch Margaret Hoolihan slowly disappear behind Loretta Swit's helmet hair and false eyelashes, and you'd be forgiven for missing Henry and Frank a little bit. Or a lot."
3,Garry Burghoff's disappearance matters little,By season 8 of MASH we viewers were accustomed to seeing less and less of Radar O'Reilly. He was in fewer and fewer eps before Burghoff outright quit anyway. Can't recall seeing him with Major Winchester (not too much). His final exit in a two part ep where he has a different voice and is really grouchy is well done enough but no match for the scenes of the dimunitive but surprisingly nifty and wolfish guy in season one. MASH definitely got worse over time.
5,I'VE BEEN A BIG MASH FAN FOR 6 YEARS NOW!,MASH IS THE BEST TV SHOW EVER!I LOVE SEASON 8 MY FAVORITE EPISODES ARE LEND A HAND APRIL FOOLS OLD SOLDIERS!MASH RULES FOR EVER!FROM A BIG MASH FAN FOR 6 YEARS NOW KIRSTEN
2,Worst M*A*S*H Season Ever,"While there are a few gems among these episodes (""Heal Thyself"" and ""War Co-Respondent"" come to mind), most of them are far below the standards set by earlier seasons of this series.The beginning of the season saw a complete turn-over of the writing staff, and the new people pretty clearly (at least at first) weren't up to the job. What's worse, fame and success were obviously starting to go to the cast's collective head. Thus you had Alan Alda writing and directing an episode which he spends bickering with his father, the usually humble Mulcahy demanding (and getting) a promotion, and pretty much everybody seeming very impressed with their own wit. While other shows have managed to survive much heavier doses of cast ego, this sort of thing is especially wrong for M*A*S*H because it makes our heroes no longer seem unhappy to be where they are.Die-hard fans, of course, will want to collect the whole series. But I'll be skipping this one."
1,Purchase of M*A*S*H Season 8,"I had to return this product because it contained Season 1 disks instead of Season 8 disks. I didn't see any way to simply ask for an exchange so I am expecting a refund and will have to re-order. You should have an option to exchange.And I hope someone checks it before they send the replacement, when I do re-order!"
2,C * R * A * P,"I'm sorry but this Season is pure crap.The very minute Radar left and that big-nose, loud-mouthed, unfunny ""Klinger"" became company clerk, the show took a complete nosedive. The whole cast started to look and act stale, not to mention the ridiculously lame humor that crept into the show - it was totally forced!.How on earth could characters like BJ (Bore Jay) Hunnicutt possibly wear that 70's moustache and pink attire as being indicative of early 1950's dress ? Not to mention Margaret Houlihan's terrible facial and hair job - she look's like something out of a doll shop.Nup, these changes along with very weak storylines and recycled themes meant that the once great M*A*S*H had gone forever. Sad, really, since this show would have been a true classic had it finished at the end of Season 7."
5,Great deal,MASH is always a treat to watch and I was especially happy to be able to buy it for such a bargain before Christmas.
4,Goodbye Radar,"Season 8 is a great season in the series of MASH. We say a sad goodbye to Radar, who came a boy and left a man. With Radar's departure we see the rest of the cast become a family, something that had not been the case since season 5. I think that the cast was finally getting comfortable with the changes, and now that radar is gone(he'd been trying to leave since season 6) I think everyone calms back down and gets back to business.There are some great shows in this season:Guerilla my dreams: a great show that shows why this series can't be classified a comedy.Life Time: a great show, that convinced me that the series still had a lot of relevant unique stories still to tellApril Fools: a GREAT show, one of my favorites, that has a twist that you won't see coming.Morale victory: I liked this one because it was different. We see the humanity of Charles like never before.This was a great season for MASH that I think helped America love the show even more."
3,No show should be on this long,"I mean it. Even the Simpsons. Most series run their course after 4 or 5 seasons and Mash was no different. Not saying there cannot be enjoyable episodes because there are, but we become hangers on for the sake of memories sake and for love of the characters, not for love of the creativity. I'll admit it, I'm a fan of the Trapper era but it doesn't change the facts.I thank God, Starsky and Hutch, Star Trek (original), and so many other shows I follow went out when they still made a statement... and not the same statements over and over. The problem with a show of this format is they are a prisoner of their surroundings where as a show like Columbo can go on forever, it's really just simple geography.And do they really need to call these the ""Collectors"" Editions? How about ""The Only"" Editions (as far as DVD is concerned)? Plus, the term ""Collector"" implies more than ugly MONO sound and NO EXTRAS. I may buy this someday, maybe when they re-re-release it in 5.1 DD."
5,J'en ai marre de vos 20 mots,"je refuse de passer mon temps d'écrire 20 mots si je n'ai rien à dire saufque le service et produit mérite 5 sur 5. Donc, je ne vais pas faire plus de commentairessur mes autres commandes si vous continuez à éxiger ces stupids 20 mots!"
5,MASH Season 8,Are there any new descriptive words for any MASH episodes/Seasons? I have the complete set and enjoy them frequently. Also have the Goodbye-Farewell-Amen episodes and the reunion episode. Wonderful program.
1,Wrong DVD in Season,I didnt hate the Mash season itself but I did not get the first Disc to season 8 instead it was for season 10 and since the pack is open I cant get it replaced or refunded. Its soppose to be the part where Radar leaves Mash
1,MASH season eight,Twice I ordered this DVD and both times instead of season eight being in the case season ONE was in it -- Correct case - wrong DVD.... go figure!
5,mash season 8,Another great set. My wife looks forward to each release. This is another in a long line of the mash series.
4,Changes to the 4077,"This a very funny season. Is sad when Radar leaves, but a lot of fun thing happen when Klinger became the company clerk. We can also have lost of fun with the jokes on Charles. This is a most have."
1,unhappy,I recieved the case for season eight but inside was season one! They need to check to see what is inside before they send the product!
4,Summer the way it used to be...,"Whoa! Trip to yester year.... Matt Dillon is outstanding in one of his earlier and most memorable flicks. A great story well told, we learn that father really does ""know best"", and that the old-fashioned values are the only substantial anchor. Fisher Stevens as Hawk is awesome in his first ""named"" role. Also good is Janet Jones (better-known now as Wayne Gretzky's wife)--heaven only knows why she never received another significant role. Too bad the film was marred by a couple of iterations of the PG-13 word and a nude sex scene (sensitive body parts hidden...)--I would like to have shown this one to my kids."
3,Honor thy father,"In 1963, a kid from Brooklyn (Matt Dillon) takes a summer job as a cabana boy at a ritzy beach resort serving the wealthy instead of learning about hard work by taking an office job that his father (Hector Elizondo) has arranged for him. He becomes enthralled by a flashy car salesman (Richard Crenna) who is the reigning king at the gin rummy table and has a beautiful daughter (Janet Jones).This is a pleasant enough film with good performances and valuable messages about hard work and paying attention to the people who love you. The only problem was that the screenplay was so clearly written in service of these messages that every single plot strand played out exactly as I expected it to, which made the story feel a bit mechanical."
2,Question about this item,"Don't know where all the old reviews went. ""Moviemaker,"" are you out there?This VCR/DVD recorder has stopped responding to the remote, except that the ""eject"" button still works on the remote. Yes, I've changed the batteries several times. The VCR is still taping the program that I had it programmed to tape, but of course I can't watch any tapes because I can't view anything (tapes or DVDs) with this machine. It used to work. Any suggestions? I have this haunting feeling I just need to press some button somewhere and I can't figure out where. Thanks."
1,Don't buy this item,"After the warrenty passed the RF output died; only the ""individual outputs"" worked, ie, the Component Video Outputs.After a few months I decided to put this machine to another use as a simple tuner. That is when it went it went ""crazy."" When it powered-up it tried to read a DVD that wasn't present. It continued to open and close the DVD tray every few minutes. Eventually it stopped with the tray open.That's when I slammed the tray shut. It stopped that behavior.This machine still displayes ""Hello"" when it should present something about time or condition.I'm using this machine at this time only to see Comcast cable on the basic plan.I haven't shut it off since the ""slamming.""In my opinion, this machine is a piece of crap."
2,Good and Bad,"Bad first. The DVD player freezes up on a fairly regular basis, in most cases with rented DVD's. This requires you to get up and manually hold the power button to reset the machine. After resetting you may get lucky and the machine may resume playing from the previous DVD location. However, the result many times is a message informing the user that the disk cannot be read or there is no disk. I then have to play the disk in another player to finish watching the DVD.Good. I originally purchased this unit to transfer VHS recordings (home movies) to DVD. The machine performs this function flawlessly. I have created several DVD's from VHS and from digital camcorders with no problems."
2,imperfect,"this item installed on 2007 4runner,it is not a perfect fit.thr rear doors part they were hard to set in place and they bowed after, but no problem with the window up or down.the front they were easier to install did not bow but problem when lifting the windows up hitting the back end of the vent.you need two hands to push the vent out to be able to lift your front windows."
4,"Hey, it rocks...","15 bands, 15 songs, rock n' roll, how can you go wrong? People who play insturments playing them for the Hell of it. Imagine that, in this the age of the fabricated pop star, people still make real rock music. Get some, you may find yourself interested in music again."
2,"Good for scanning slide, BUT....Moisture Stamp under glasses",I got this one two weeks ago. I was using it to scan my slides.Software and Hardware are pretty easy to use and scanning quality is good too. I was happy to have it...BUT...I found there is a big Moisture Stamp under glasses last night !I will return it today.
2,Look elseware for a quality scanner.,"I have been extremely disappointed by this scanner. I bought it new a few months ago, but found that little spots appear on scanned photos for 600dpi and higher. I've cleaned the scan bed and photos. The problem appears to be on the other side of the glass. To get half-way decent scans, you have to hunt for the area of the scan bed with the fewest marks. Cannon sent me a replacement (referb.) which has the same problem but to a lesser degree. A third scanner is supposedly on its way.The whole experience has been less than positive and makes me question Cannon's quality control process. It's highly unlikely I'll be purchasing another Canon scanner in the future."
1,Image Quality Stinks!,"I have purchased two of these scanners because I was hoping that the first one was defective. It was, and I think the second one was too! The closest I can come to describing the problem is to say that there was condensation under the flatbed glass. It dried and left a residue that shows up on every scan. The first time I thought this was a fluke (although I had read a review that said it happened to them.) so I returned it and ordered another. The same thing happened with this one. When I called Canon to ask about the problem they played dumb and said they hadn't heard of this problem. Well it happend twice to me and at least once to another review so it does exist. The biggest problem I am going to have now is finding another scanner that has the multi-scan feature. It was very cool to pop four pictures on the flatbed, scan them, and have them come out as four different JPEGS. What to do?"
2,Not worth for the price..,"Photo scanning: Quality is very low. We can see the ""paper texture"".Negative scanning: Too much on the blue side. Even with ""auto calibration"", all scans turns out blueish. Quality is soso.Software: One of the worst software package. The software are soo basic, you can't do anything special or configure the scanner correctly.NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,Mort,"A significant use for which I bought this scanner was for my wife and me to make copies on my printer using the one-button. I installed it today and, to my dismay, it didn't work. After two hoours on the phone with Canon tech support, Canon gave up and said it won't work with a laser printer. I have a laser printer with 1700 KB memory but it wasn't enough. This is a warning to prospective purchasers."
2,canon scan 5000f,the scanner is very easy to use but the quality come up short from my exspectations
1,Boring,"My own opinion of this movie - not worth watching.Not much of a plot, tedious, acting tiring.Could hardly stay awake to see the end."
2,Predictable and Dull,"Yes, the main character is defintitely charasmatic and appealing, but the story itself is a predictable ""odd couple"" scenario, in which the gentleman cast opposite to ""Solo"" is neither sympathetic nor noteworthy. In fact, he is a rather wooden chap. Although this film aspires to be uplifiting and inspiring, it lacks the dramatic qualities needed to succeed."
2,tribal fusions 2,"Where do I begin indeed? I have to agree with the first reviewer, this dvd is all over the place. As much as I love Bellydance Superstars, I just do not know what to think of this production. Unlike the first Fusion dvd, which was awesome, this one does not live up to the hype. The 1920's flapper, Moulin Rougey vibe seemed confusing. The performances seemed forced and looked like not much effort was put into them. The only performances that are worth the money I spent on this dvd are, Moria Chappell's second performance, Fat Chance Bellydance, and Sonia and Colleen. Elizabeth Strong is just a mess. Sharon Kihara, Samantha, and Kami Liddle were all ok but not the amazing dancers I remember. I was very disappointed with this dvd. I expected the best and got mediocre. I don't recommend anyone buy this dvd unless you are a hardcore BDSS fan."
2,seriously?,I dont know where to begin. All the ladies looked lovely as usual but thats about it. The music selection is like a new orleans soundtrack literally sounds like a jambalaya rice commercial...like are you kidding me? elizabeth strong just doesnt seem to fit in right. A lot of this is too wannabe flapper 1930's sideshow freak dancing. It is wayy too over the top. The only alright performances were sharon's and fat chance bellydances performance. I was absolutely dissapointed.
4,The real deal on Addiction Recovery,"As a recovering alcoholic and addict for 19 years and a professional worker in the field for 16 years, this book was so refreshing to read. Most people who work with addicts will tell you that until they achieve some sort of ""spiritual experience"" often through a faith based program such as AA, NA, etc. they never achieve long-term contented abstinence. Even though the author is outside the field of addiction and is primarily a journalist, he does an astonishing job of surfacing the issues that are the ""elephant in the living room"" of addiction treatment and recovery. With all due respect to the medical and psychological research and literature, none of it speaks as clearly as this book about what ""causes"" recovery from addiction."
2,not like the one's from a store,These do not taste the same as the one's I buy from supermarkets. The tea covers are cheap paper compared to the ones I buy else where. It tastes really weak too. I ordered six packs but will not order tea from internet again unless I read some good reviews.
4,"great, for an herbal tea","Can't believe I tried it. Not an herbal tea fan. Even so, it is a surprisingly tasty tea."
4,Lipton discontinued this tea,"Spent way to much for it. But my wife likes it, so I bought it. She has been drinking this for years, and loves it.Lipton discontinued making this herbal tea, not sure why, but I wish they would bring it back."
5,Flintstones: A Flintstone's Christmas Carol DVD,"Fred's so caught up in his role as Scrooge in the Bedrock production of ""A Christmas Carol"" that he's forgetting to take care of his family--but Wilma and the rest of the familiar crew are there to keep him on track in this Flintstones holiday special. This DVD includes the perennial holiday favorite plus bonus episode: Christmas Flintstone."
5,Flintstones Christmas Carol,The Flintstones Christmas Carol movie is great. It is definately an all time favorite that the whole family should enjoy together for the holidays.
5,Funny and Unique telling of A Christmas Carol,"A Flintstone Christmas Carol is one of my favorite holiday movies. Although I was already an adult when it debuted, it touches me, makes me laugh, and it just isn't Christmas without it. I used to watch it every year on The Cartoon Network but when it didn't appear in their schedule this Christmas, I was heartbroken. I was so glad to hear it was on DVD and Amazon had it.It is a great way to get your children to watch this classic story and it is a good lesson to them about loving and being good to one another. It tells the story in a way they can understand and it is ""watchable"" to adults as well. In fact, I can watch it over and over and never bore with it."
5,Yabba Dabba Great,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, for having this wonderful movie available. I always liked the Flinstones, and I just love this movie. I watched it so much, I wore it out, and had to buy my second copy! I advise everyone to get this movie, and really get into the Christmas spirit!"
4,FLINTSTONES VERSION OF THE CLASSIC,"The Bedrock gang give their version of the Dickens classic. Fred lands the role of Scrooge in the Bedrock Community Theatre version of the play. Fred throws himself into the role as Scrooge and soon starts having delusions of granduer as he thinks he's on his way to broadway...or Broadrock or something. Anyway Fred starts treating everyone poorly, forgets to do his shopping and to pickup Pebbles. He's only thinking about his rehearsal for his role.The play goes on with everyone upset at Fred but he, like Scrooge, eventually learns the error of his ways at the end, and gains the true Christmas spirit. This is about what you'd expect from a Hanna Barbera production in terms of animation. While it doesn't have the adult-oriented humor of the 1960's show it's still pretty good in general and worth at least one viewing."
4,great Christmas story,"loved flintstones since i was a young boy and now mature adult i still love it, great Xmas story done by whole Flintstones. i loved it."
4,I liked it,"I have this on video and I really enjoy watching it. I think the Flintstone's version of Dicken's classic is really interesting. The ""Bedrock Bug"" concept is funny too. This is highly recommended. Oh, I also liked the line by Philo, the cop: ""You'd better get the stars out of your eyes and watch where you're going."""
3,"""What the Dickenstone?!""","Seriously, folks, this Hanna-Barbera adaptation of the classic Charles Dickens book is not bad. Fred Flintstone takes on the role of Ebenezer Scrooge (and is full of it) while wife Wilma manages the show off and on stage. One cast member after another comes down with the 'Bedrock Bug,' a flu-like illness which turns its victims green and disables them for at least 24 hours. Fred must pull off the role of a lifetime and redeem himself to his family before the Bug finds him. Faithful to the story, and imaginative at times; I don't see Dickens' ghost getting restless over this."
5,Memories,This brings back memories of my childhood and the Christmas' I had with my family. It is one of my favorites. I am very satisfied.
5,Yabba Dabba Doo!,"It was just as I remembered! We enjoyed watching the ""Flintstones Christmas Carol"" very much! It is definitely kid friendly and not ""dark"" like the original Dickens ""Christmas Carol"". The whole family can enjoy this movie together for the holidays!"
1,This was pretty bad,We were excited to watch this over the holidays but the sound quality and the voices of the characters was way off. Not a fan of Fred flirting with his eyes popped out like that. At least not when sitting with a family of all ages for a Christmas Cartoon. Will probably give it away since we turned it off early and moved on to a different movie.
2,No better than integrated graphics,I went through the trouble of installing this only to discover that it is even less capable than the integrated graphics of my motherboard. So it sits with my collection of obsolete hardware.
3,Lulu Review,I choose this rating because I don't know or have never heard of some of the songs Lulu as an artist is fabulous
3,As great as these hits can be...,"I like Lulu and bought this solely for a remastered ""To Sir with Love"". She's done plenty of interesting stuff beyond this 60's top-40 hit. How much you appreciate her other work will be a matter of taste; something that is lacking is some of the cuts in this collection."
4,Lulu still rocks,"This collection of Lulu tunes cover her career. It's amazing when one of the '60s performers manages to continue to have hits for all these years. Great collection, nicely priced. Great singer. Has all her hit songs."
4,Solid pop,"I had heard bits and pieces of this record. All at once this is a lot of Lulu to listen to. Works well in my itunes mix, though."
5,Still Great,"Lula continues to be great to listen to. I really like the way she sings, ""Oh Me Oh My"" on this CD."
2,Disappointing,"This product seems like a great idea, but its much easier, quicker, and more effective to find a buddy to pump the brakes for you."
1,It broke the first day,"After opening it and using it a few times, it broke (the metal pieces securing the handle to the pump shaft popped off). For such a sturdy and solid design as a whole there shouldn't be this weakness, very bad/fragile design. It's a shame, I chose this product due to its perceived quality so this exact scenario would not happen (the plastic one I owned before did the same thing).If you expect to get some real, solid use out of this pump you might look elsewhere to one of the other metal pumps (mityvac seem to be a good alternative that don't have this design flaw)"
2,Spend money elsewhere,I would have saved my money had I known what pain it would be to seal this up for use. I ordered a pump that fills from brake reservoir under pressure by motive products specific to my app instead after all of the trouble.
3,Fair,"No real stand outs on this recording. Nonetheless, it's a fair to good example of late 70's salsa, with some funky bass playing by Sal Cuevas."
2,Not good for beginners,"I got this dvd because the summary on the box implied it would be easy to follow. However, the pace was too fast and the moves changed too often to be giving a good workout to a beginner like myself. Plus, the camera angles, as some other reviews mentioned, made it even harder to follow. If they had not advertised this as easy to follow, I wouldn't be so disappointed. I recently started following another dvd, Ultimate Fat Burn by Women's HealthWomen's Health: Ultimate Fat Burn!, and that was a much better example of a good workout for beginners. It has a good pace, and allows you to focus more on the quality of your workout rather than racing through it."
4,Hard- But GOOD Hard!,"I first watched the video to get an idea, and I immediatly put it aside, as I thought ""that looks like way too much!"" However, the other day I thought I would try it... well I did I couldn't finish it, but I will! The point is MAXIMUM Calorie burn is right! It is broken up into segments so you have moments to cool down and you don't fatigue your muscles at one time.... so I like it a lot and I can't wait to do it again and finish! If you want a good cardio video with basic moves that are not super dancy this is for you!"
3,"Very difficult workout, not for beginners","I have been a Firm user for almost 4 years and love almost everything I have purchased with the Firm name. This video, however, was a bit of a disappointment. I find this instructor difficult to follow and the moves are somewhat difficult to do at the high speed set with using proper form. I certainly would NOT recommend this video for a beginner - advanced Firm users only. You will definately get a great sweat, but I find myself calling the instructor names. Good or bad?...you decide! I will continue to use this video - as I know if I can ever do this video without being drenched in sweat I am TOTALLY in shape!"
4,Good Workout!,"I really like this DVD! It constantly changes it up, although it does take a couple times to get the moves down. I agree with a previous comment that the camera work is little to be desired (which is why I am rating it a 4). Sometimes I have no idea what the instructor is doing because the aren't focusing on her and/or her entire body. But overall a good workout, even for a beginner!!"
4,"Excellent, fun workout!","I've been trying to convince myself to try the Firm for a long time but haven't mustered the courage. I don't know; something about the pink cases with Barbie-doll instructors made me think it wasn't going to be a real workout. So when I finally took the plunge and picked this one up, I was ambivalent.Sigh of relief-this workout is a lot of fun! I enjoyed myself the whole way through and felt great afterwords. There were a few places where I didn't understand the motion, but I actually liked that because I just substituted some of my favorite cardio moves that were not featured in the video. The sequencing is great to keep you interested and prevent injury, boredom, or just getting worn out.I agree with some of the posts that the instruction sounds uncomfortable and a bit robotic, but this didn't really bother me since I was having so much fun doing the moves."
2,Disappointed,"I consider myself a fan of The FIRM workouts, but this one just didn't do anything for me. I found that the transitions between the cardio and strength training segments were weak. It was aggravating having to do cardio, then pick up the weights, then drop the weights, then do more cardio, then pick up the weights every two minutes. It was quiet annoying after a while.Also, while I love most of the instructors I've seen with The FIRM, Alison Davis just seemed so stiff and robotic for me. When she mentioned how our ""guns"" were going to look, I couldn't help but crack up at the absurdity of her comment. It's one thing to hear my thirteen year old students (I'm a teacher) mention that, but it just seemed so foreign coming out of her mouth.On a positive note, I loved how the workout was divided up into chapters, and I did work up quiet a sweat, but overall, it's not a keeper for me."
1,Not your typical bootcamp workout!,"I have some of the older Firm workouts and really enjoy them. More recently I have been doing local bootcamps and P90x, based on the good reviews I purchased the Firm Get Chisel'd and the Bootcamp Maximum Calorie Burn for a change of pace. I felt like some of the exercises were unsafe and really did not get a good workout. Depending on what you are looking for these might be good workouts but they are not for me and I will be taking them to Goodwill!"
2,Would NOT recommend,"I've never purchased any of the Firm workout DVD's so I was excited to try this one. The format of this workout is broken up into two types of segments--cardio and plyometrics. Overall, it's a good workout and does get you sweating quite a bit. However, the instructor is the reason that I only give this video 2 stars. Although, I don't care for peppy instructors, this one was quite the opposite extreme. She had no energy whatsoever and the most annoying part was that she referred to Sue Mi, the lady doing the modified moves a thousand times!!! The only reason that I can think of why she would refer to Sue Mi so many times is because she was nervous and was looking for fillers. It really deters me from wanting to work out to this DVD."
5,Still Using This One After A Year!,I have been through many home video workouts. I bought this over a year ago and still use it more consistently than any others. I have not gotten bored with it. I also like that the only equipment is optional hand weights.It's a challenging work out if you go with the 'Advanced' instructors and a solid workout if you follow the 'Beginner'.
5,I love it!,"I bought this DVD because the firm always creates good workouts. They did not let me down. My heart rate was up, I was sweating and having a good time. What more can you ask for? The moves can be a little bit hard to follow the first couple times because sometimes when the instructor is demonstrating the advanced moves, the camera is on the beginner. There are also a lot of squats and lunges, so if you have bad knees, you may need to modify or skip or section. All in all, this is a great workout, and it is definitely one of my favorites."
5,good calorie blaster,this is an intense workout. that first cardio segment is pretty tough. the weights are not that hard but your body definitely feels different after this video!
2,Too difficult to follow,"I'm honestly admitting that I'm uncoordinated and found this choreography very difficult to follow. I feel that the instructor changes moves too often, leaving me confused and frustrated.I decided to go with Beachbody DVDs instead (with Debbie Siebers). They are challenging, yet easy to follow with lots of repetition (not changing moves too quickly, unlike the Firm). I'm a seasoned exerciser, but my body was too used to the treadmill. I needed a change. Beachbody has given me great results and people compliment me all the time on my body (I'm 36 and a mother of 2 boys).In summary, if you're coordinated and able to follow quickly-changing moves, then the Firm is for you. If you're looking for a challenging, but easy to follow work-out, spend your money on Beachbody instead."
3,A little too fast paced...,I have a lot of Firm workouts which I enjoy. This isn't a terrible workout but it was extremely hard for me to keep up with the first part of the workout with all the fast paced moves. It wasn't until it got to the kickboxing portion of the dvd that it got easier for me. I may need to just watch it over several times before trying to get it down pat.
2,Not that great,"I am not the fittest of the fit, but I am relatively healthy. I work out a few times a week to different dvd's or by walking a few miles. This DVD was not a challenge in the least. It was boring, slow, and I did not feel like I was truly excerting myself at any point. It was not effiective for me at all. If you more of a beginner than you will find it suitable for a while. I feel as though I wasted my money."
1,Must have dance skills,"This looks like a good workout, but they need a disclaimer that you must be advanced in aerobics or dance to participate.....some fancy footwork to try to learn. It is to complicated for a beginner."
3,Cant stand the accent,"Great workout, tough and challenging but Im sorry I couldn't get past the southern accent. Warmin' up those muscles and thi's"" it was distracting for me...who knows maybe thats what I sound like I am from the south, but if I was going to be on a DVD somebody tell me please and give me speech lessons."
4,Alison really works you out!!,"I didn't think this dvd was going to be this tough. But, I must say that I have gotten a very good workout from all of the dvd's Alison leads on. Whenever i see her leading the dvd I will but it because she always makes me sweat and gives me a good workout. Would reccomend to people to try you will get a good workout."
2,Not worth the money.,"It has some great ideas - large tub, upper rack that moves, steam is recycled and not blown into kitchen, energy saving upper / lower rack washes - but does not do the job. It does not wash my dishes well even if rinced, even on the strongest setting. Disappointing. Also, the main board and the display board had to be replaced within the first four months. Not worth the money."
1,Breaks better than it cleans,"I've had this dishwasher for a little over a year. I've had to call the company twice to send me replacement rollers for the racks, and one of the plastic holders for the movable racks broke. It's very frustrating to not be able to use the functionality of changing rack position or pulling out the racks to unload. I get better results for cleaning difficult food when using the powerscrub and strong spray settings (with Electrosol tabs). However, I still need to take some dishes out and wash them by hand."
3,Not what I expected,"I have had this dishwasher for about a month, and it does not clean as well as I had expected. I had better results with my apartment Hotpoint than I do with this $700 one. I do like the features (moveable rack for large plates on top, adjustable tines),it looks pretty,and it is quiet, however, I have to rewash at least two items with every load. My flatware is also getting nicked up pretty badly. I plan to excahnge it for another brand, although I hate to since it took 4 delivery attempts to actuallly get this one in my house!"
1,Worst dishwasher at any price,"Looks great. but dishes were not coming out clean. Several repairmen later, we only ran it on ""strong"" setting. Then the main motor blew out. Then a year or so later, the ""diverter"" motor blew out. After that was replaced the door gasket started leaking. And LG service is no help, even in the warranty period.The manufacturer should be ashamed."
1,Bad Quality DeckCell,"I have ordered two sets of these batteries for SONY DCR-IP5 and both batteries are defective on arrival. the product is made in china, no proper packing and packaging, the quality seems to be very very bad, i dont recommend any consumer to buy these sets at all.To be clear on all fronts, i removed the plastic seal (cheap one), i plugged it to the camera, i turned the chargin on, the led blinked for few seconds, then it goes off, then after few minutes, the orange led came back blinking very fast, after 4 hours, i turned the camera ON, there was no ""life time battery indication"" then suddenly after few seconds the camera gave this message ""In compatible InfoLITHIUM batteries"" batteries !!!!Great Job ""Brilliant Store Inc."""
1,This is a total ripoff. This is NOT THE DALE CARNEGIE.,"I have a real hardback copy of Dale's book by the same title. Nothing on this CD comes from Dale's book. The title's of the chapters are all different, the forward totally different.This is a ripoff.And, the material certainly does not compare with the real Dale Carnegie books."
3,Lots of unseen trailers...,"This 2 tape set features one tape of nothing but a history of trailers from most all of Dukes flicks. Pretty complete although it skips a few of his later films. Pretty infomrmative insights on the production of the movies makes it worthwile too. Tape two is just the two movies, your standard B movie westerns. Unfortunatley, both tapes are recorded in EP mode which makes for somewhat unpleasant viewing, but Im holding onto it for tape 1. It gives me insight to some of the Duke movies I havent seen yet and is fun to watch every now and then. Hollywood just doesnt make them like John Wayne anymore. Long live The Duke!"
4,Excellent resource for Johnny Lightning collectors,"This book is an excellent resource for all Johnny Lightning collectors, experienced and novice. It provides much information on the history of JL and many of the nuances of collecting, manufacturing, etc. There are great color photos of many cars. Price ranges are also included as well as how to rate the condition of the cars. The only drawback I can see is there is little to no info on many of the newer cars/sets. The index is also somewhat difficult to follow, especially if you don't know what year the car was manufactured. Perhaps this will be included in the next edition? Overall, I highly recommend this book to anybody interested in Johnny Lightning collecting!"
3,Not much for vintage Johnny Lightning collectors.,"This is a slick and attractive book, and I suppose great if you're into collecting the modern Playing Mantis Johnny Lightning cars, but there's precious little here on the original vintage JL cars: only two pages of photographs. At least you get a picture of each of the original cars.So, my three star rating probably reflects my disappointment both in the descriptions I read here as well as the book it self. It's almost useless to me as a vintage JL collector."
2,Not a dependable unit,"Upon receiving the MP3 player everything worked as expected. However, the unit kept indicating that the battery was not fully charged, even though it was charged overnight. Now it's come to the point where it won't hold a charge and the unit is therefore completely useless. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this MP3 player: it lacks dependability. It only uses USB 1.0 (slower) to load music and photos ... not the faster USB 2.0 I'm sending it back."
1,Pretty Cheap,"Earphones fall apart in about 4 weeks, wire length for earphones is way too short to even place in a pocket, easily gets scratched, easily gets dented, hard to navigate, cheap menues, dont buy it or else youll regret it."
5,A beautiful print of a truly important film,"I will be 30 next year. This was my favorite film when I was 15. I remember I taped it off of TBS and must have watched it at least 50 times. Watching this truly exceptional widescreen print brought back a lot of memories. I usually try to watch period movies in the context of their era, but this film is timeless. Do yourself a favor when watching this film: try to focus not on the (coincidental) early deaths of its' stars but instead on the powerful potrayals within."
5,"Fantastic film, beautifully preserved on DVD!","Definitely on my Top Ten List of magnificent movies, EAST OF EDEN is beautifully preserved on this DVD with a decent commentary track (although they'd've been better off getting Julie Harris or Dick Davalos). Disc Two offers some fun bonus features, such as wardrobe tests, a fan-friendly documentary and some newsreel footage (yes, that is CABARET's Joel Grey---looks like he had some rhinoplasty since this was shot!).The movie itself is wonderful. Great performances all the way around and you will barely notice the Fifties styles thrust into 1917 California--the story, the acting, the cinemtagrophy are all wayyyy too rich and sumptuous.Excellent collection for film buffs and, especially, James Dean admirers."
5,One of the Great Films!,This is one of the great films. The drama is so stirring I have the most pained look on my face at the end of this film as I try not to cry before I inevitably do. James Dean made three films and all were great but this one is the best. He was truly a great actor and a great loss. The other actors are just as skilled and the director Elia Kazan makes the most out of his actors. This disk contains not just a great print of the film but several terrific special features. The commentary with Richard Schickel is absorbing enough to keep you glued to the television set for another two and half hours. Just a wonderful movie.
2,James Dean was wonderful but the film was disappointing,"I've lately been reading great novels of the twentieth century and I'd just finished John Steinbeck's East of Eden. Certainly Steinbeck's best, the novel expands on the Biblical story of Cain and Abel through three generations of a family, more true to the Biblical text than most preachers ever could be, and philosophically ahead of its time. But this movie version is disappointing. The script was clearly written to showcase the promising young actor James Dean stereotyped in the ""what's happening to our teenagers"" 50's angst. The script obliterated Steinbeck's story line, cut out the Greek Chorus-like main character of the novel- the Chinese manservant Lee- and tried to focus a multi-generational theme into a few months of a wayward teen's life. The film is only a 'classic' because Dean was superb and he died so young. I highly recommend the 1981 mini-series TV film version of the story over the 50's 'classic.'"
2,This is a classic?,"I liked the acting and the production values. It is well crafted. I'm not impressed with the story. What a wacky, unlikely family. A more coherent plot would have helped also. I saw another comment saying the movie is not as good as the book. I have not read the book but I would not be surprised. Also, the playback froze a few times during playback -- that was annoying. I wish I had 2 hours of my life back."
2,Romantic dramas- rebelwithout a cause,The disk for Rebel without a cause was not in the packet with Cat on a Tin Roof. Otherwise enjoyed the movie CAT ON THE Tin Roof.
5,East of Eeden(Two-disc Special Edition),"Have not had an opportunity to view this video, as yet. Will not do so until, probably mid September. Will comment then.However, this DVD seems to be scarce and I was impressed as to the easy access and delivery to me. Thanks.Les Parrott"
1,Only one problem with this film: it sucks,"Alternative titles for this film should be ""Rebel Without a Plot"" or ""Phoniness Without a Cause."" I can't decide which one is more accurate; it's a tough call. During the film I never got the feeling that this was even a half hearted attempt at describing real life. The fact that this false, artificial, self involved movie was a touchstone for a generation of the same qualities should tell you something about the decline of our society, and not just the decline of Hollywood filmmaking.If you want true teen age nihilism try ""American Me"" or ""Boyz N the Hood"" instead."
2,let down,"What a let down, after hearing so much about this movie. It is so intellectually contrived, with Sal Mineo being named ""Plato"" and the planeterium metaphysics. It's cheap existentialism. And Dean has charisma, but should learn not to lurch about so much in his movements, nor keep his face so busy with contstant moving of his eyes and eyebrows. Any fan of John Mellencamp should observed James Dean's line on the stairs in the mansion, where he says to Mineo, ""Well, then there..."" In Mellencamp's song JACK AND DIANE, that's the line Mellencamp sings (in a perfect Dean impression): ""And he did his best James Dean, `Well, then there Diane, we ought, run off to the city...'"""
4,"NICHOLAS RAY, OPUS 11","**** 1955. Original story and direction by Nicholas Ray. Three nominations for the Oscars. James Dean and Natalie Wood, in conflict with their parents, meet Sal Mineo, a neurotic kid. They'll have to deal with a local gang and the police forces. Plato's myth of the Cavern revisited by Nicholas Ray. Behind the usual clichés of a movie about juvenile delinquents, the director tells us again the Greek myth that opposes the world of the shadows (night, planetarium, abandoned mansion) to Reality. Highly recommended."
4,A good capsulization of American life in the fifties,"So long James Dean; we'll miss you. Here's an actor who showed so much promise of a very productive acting career, but was tragically taken from us so soon. Unless you're old enough to remember this era in history and can relate to it, you probably won't find this film too interesting. The cast of this movie reads like an obituary list today; but we can all be thankful this picture is still around to showcase their talents."
3,Nothing to write home about.,It was o.k. I guess. A James Dean fanatic might like it. A Steinbeck fanatic will hate it.***Not Dean's Best***
4,Nice Film,i've heared about this film and James Dean for a while and i just got to seen Rebel without a cause and i will say that it's a good film.Not a film for all time but a film that would have been radical for 1955.It's like the movie 13 was when it came out...rugged and well recieved by fans and critics
3,Rebel oversight,"Although, The dvd version, gives more movie for your money through widesreen, Theres not much to the so called theatrical trailer, most of the attention goes to Dean & Wood, they only mention Sal Mineo as an after thought. Eventhough Dean was the lead actor, the dvd cover picture should have included all three rebels Dean,Wood,Mineo"
2,Boring and tired,"I've heard the hype for so long. Finally saw the movie and don't see what the big deal is. Dean looked like he was 35/40 years old so the high school edge was unbelievable. Too much drama and overacting. Dean's character needed a whooping, that would have handled that ."
5,Rebel Without a Cause a Classic,This movie is wonderful. It is a classic that will never go out of style. James Dean had a style of acting no one else has.
5,TCM Classic James Dean,Great mix of movies; outstanding performances still touch your sole. Thanks for putting four in collection and great picks for sure.
3,a good study in alientated youth,"the characters in Rebel Without A Cause are three youths who feel negected by their parents. James dean and natalie woods character are not merely troubled outcasts but are rightfully angry kids with insight and concern into their plight. They are not simply juvenile delinquents but kids searching for a better family life. Althought Rebel is a worthwhile and interesting film,Crime In The Streets also starring Sal Mineo is a better and more powerful film from that period. This films gets right to the heart of the mentality of tough kids. The plot may seem simple to some, but the idea of an angry gang leader seeking to murder a man who told him off and slapped him is very true to life of this kind of person. The leader believes that no one can mees with him--if they do they die--. Whats more in regard to the review from the last person, some gang members in the 50s had guns too and used them. Check out some articles in the times from 1956 and 1957."
3,Not very good.,"I'm a fan of old movies, and I'm a fan of James Dean. But this movie fell short of my expectations. I found it shallow, and just plain silly... perhaps I'm just out of touch with that generation. When you think about it, Plato is the real Rebel Without A Cause... and I really didn't like that character. Maybe that's why this movie isn't so good, not enough Dean."
3,James Dean's debut,"This is a good film (arguably Dean's best), and is very worthy of having in your dvd collection."
4,now I get why all the girls like him!,"I've been hearing about James Dean often the last year, so I wanted to know what the hype was about. I now get it, he is different from all the other guys. He knows what's right and does what he feels is right...even though everyone seems to be against him. I love it!"
4,not as good as book,Of course no movie is as good as the book and of course Hollywood changed book but for most part it goes with book and has same message my opinion read book then. Watch this movie then movie is good
5,"Great product, great price","I can't imagine buying four great movies at a bargain price, two of them classics with James Dean. Fabulous."
4,A shadow of the book,"This classic with James Dean actually covers the last 25% or so of the famous novel by John Steinbeck. Having read the book first, it was hard to take the movie on its own. Of necessity, the film simplifies the characters--the stern father, the rebellious son, the good son and his perfect girlfriend, and locks them in a classic tale of sibling rivalry. Because we don't know anything of the history of the mother Cathy, or Kate, she is portrayed almost sympathetically in the film. The wonderful character of Lee from the book is absent, as is the wonderful sense of the country these settlers tamed. On its own, though, it's a fine film with a star cast--Julie Haris, Burl Ives, Raymond Massey, and the legendary Dean."
5,Rebel Without A Cause - DVD,"All DVD Collections of films should have this movie. Even more so if the Collector is a Baby Boomer. One of James Deans best......sadly, I think he only made 4 movies. All standouts. ""Rebel Without A Cause"", to Me, is timeless. Teenagers, growing up, high school, w/bullying and 'gangs', young love, angst, finding oneself, cars, and all the other 'trappings' of Youth."
2,"Screen was fuzzy at some parts, movie was also so not as good as the book!","This is an old movie, so I'm not terribly surprised about the screen quality. I was thankful that Amazon even had it as a choice for me to rent! However, I will be honest in saying that the screen went fuzzy a few times for about 15 seconds and then returned to normal, which I wasn't expecting. Also, if you are excited to see the movie because you thought the book was great, don't bother seeing it, because it was terrible. East of Eden is one of those books that no movie could ever justify."
3,Rebel Without A Cause.,"Pretty good film,Of A Troubled man sadly. Played by James Dean who was a troubled man himself. There is much irony in his portrayal in this film. so much potential gone in a tragic accident."
3,Reflection,"It amazes me that no-one seems to undertake a new production of this brilliant story. The movie only deals with a small part - if you've seen the movie, you must read the book."
4,Great for spider veins,"I ordered this product in hopes of covering up some dark veins on my lower leg and ankle. I have had medical procedures to clear up larger veins on my upper leg but that hasn't seem to have helped to clear up the lower ""superficial"" veins. If applied by ""patting"" it does an unbelievable job of covering up the veins. I was skeptical that is was going to look like ""make up"" but after it dried, it really blended in with my skin. I am very satisfied and feel confident to wear skirts and dresses again!"
1,Requested a refund and never got a response,"""I ordered Leg Magic and it did not work at all. I bought it to cover up a birthmark and it did not work. I still saw the mark and you can tell the leg magic was on it because it did not blend into with my skin tone. I contacted the seller twice to see if i can get a refund and they never answered me. I am so mad that I did not ever get a response. They could of at least told me no. Very rude!"""
1,horribly blotchy,"This product may work for someone with very smooth skin, but for me it was blotchy and cakey. Couldn't wait to wash it off, I mean scrub! Undoubtedly with some expertise, the product could go on more evenly, just not my luck."
1,Received wrong color,I was so excited to order this product to see if it would work for me. I was so bummed to see that inspite of me ordering true beige and even the shipping box and ticket they sent me said it was true beige to my surprise it was actually almond. I mean how do you mess something like that up. They don't even sound the same. I sent a request to return it and still haven't heard anything back. I don't think Ill be ordering from them again. Shipping was super fast but maybe that's why they screwed my order up.
1,Not the truth,"There was no converter as advertised, as in ""comes with"". It said ""comes with an optional converter."" That seem self-contradictory, but ""comes with"" does not. So where is it?"
4,A beloved tool when modified,It is not possible to store the cap to the pen on the end of the pen which is irritating. However I cut the end off with my bandsaw and glued a plastic colored thumbtack cap on the end for cosmetic purposes. (They color metal thumbtacks by affixing lightweight colored caps onto them. They are easy to remove.) Now the cap to the pen fits on great. Plus the pen is lighter which is always a bonus for me. At first I found this pen very stiff and its ink flow very light. However the distribution of ink is so steady it is possible to use it as fast as you can use a pencil and build up tone the way one might want to with an ink pen (Van Gogh etc.) I use the converter and my own purchased walnut ink rather than cartridges. It has loosened up a bit and I must say at this point I am happy with it. No hint of leakage to date.
3,Do some hunting before you purchase this one (and where you should purchase it),"Im not sure if my pen is defective or not, but I havent got the catridges to puncture/load properly-- that could be just me though. My main criticism is that this pen is much much cheaper on art websites-- by about $10. Rotring seems to be a brand gradually discontinuing more and more of its products... I'm not sure if this pen is the best investment to be spending top dollar on, as the true rotring favorite- the rapidograph-- has had its accessories discontinued and are increasingly hard to find, this one may also follow suite. Check other sites before purchasing here."
5,Used this pen for 12 years for Maakies comics,"My pen name is Tony Millionaire. I use nothing but this pen for ALL my cartooning and comics work (Maakies, Drinky Crow, Sock Monkey). It is reliable. The nib starts to soften after months of drawing, so it ""gives"" a little, enabling you to make a wider line with pressure. If I need a fine line, I roll the pen over and use the back of the nib. I don't use the cartridges that come in the box, they are watery and gray. I buy the good black cartridges on Ebay, they come in plastic bags. GREAT PEN! Don't know what I'll do if they ever stop making it."
3,"Great, portable pen.","I've used this thing for about 6 months. I bought it with the optional converter, which is really a must, as Rotring's cartridge ink stinks. I use it with waterproof Speedball SuperBlack, and it rarely clogs, but when it does, it starts flowing quickly if you just rinse the tip. It's a good idea to clean this with Rapido-eze pen cleaner once in a while like a Rapidograph.That said, this pen will not give you the kind of line differentiation as a crowquill, (Hunt or Speedball 102) and other reviewers were correct in saying this pen is stiff. The thinnest line is still pretty fat compared to a crowquill, but it dumps ink and doesn't cut the paper.EDIT: I downgraded this to three stars, after a few months of use I just find this too big a pain to clean properly and there's just not enough line variation when applying different pressures. It's fast and rarely skips, but for what I use it for I'd just prefer a fat Rapidograph."
4,Good Thesis but boring at times.,"There was a time we simply taught that China was isolated from the rest of the world by mountains, seas, deserts, and its own ethnocentrism. More and more we are finding out that this ""white lie"" of history is an over simplification. The Silk Road, Zheng He, are just two examples of ways China was not as isolated as we used to think.The Sextants of Beijing is a wonderful look (especially in the opening chapters) on just how China was connected to the rest of the world in ways we have overlooked or just did not understand. Personally I felt the later chapters got boring and less interesting, but the first 1/3 of the book is great.For a new look at China read this book and combine it with 1421 and the new biography of Ghengis Khan."
3,Extremely / dangerously sharp: do we need this sharp?,"Mundial 5100 Series 6-Inch Utility Knife with Serrated Edge, BlackThe knife, as advertised, is extremely sharp. My wife cut her fingers twice in the first 4 days and I did one.Never used after that. Sitting in the kitchen cabinet unused."
3,it's a well put together complation,it could be slightly better it's most uplifting album and its a good start to the evening
3,I expected more,"What could be more interesting than a book on violence written by the world's leading psychiatrist? That's what I was thinking when I bought the book. Although Beck made some interesting points, very few were original points that I wasn't already familiar with. The book is a slow read and only moderately interesting. For a much more interesting account of violence, read James Gilligan's book VIOLENCE: REFLECTIONS ON A NATIONAL EPIDEMIC.Lee J. Markowitz, Ph.D. student in clinical psychology"
5,Meryl Streep is Electrifying!,"Meryl Streep earned her third Best Actress Oscar nomination in a row with her powerful and sobering portrayal of the real-life Karen Silkwood. The filmmakers took liberties in retelling the story, but Streep, Kurt Russell and Cher are simply fantastic. If you love well made drama with real performances from stars as well as supporting characters this is a must see. And if you love Streep, there is no choice, you must own this! She'll blow you away!"
3,Radiant Movie about Radiation,"""Silkwood"" was Meryl Streep's breakthrough movie. It's no surprise why. Streep radiates class and determination as whistleblower Karen Silkwood. She brings conviction to her role, carrying the film. Though the movie's coda claims that Silkwood died under ""unknown circumstances"",one still wonders if there was a conspiracy afoot.""Silkwood"" is also a human story. Kurt Russell is excellent as Silkwood's on-again,off-again,and frequently shirtless lover Drew (this helps,since the plot slows down several times) Cher shines as Silkwood's lesbian friend Dolly. Craig T. Nelson is a convincing villain.""Silkwood"" tells an inspirational, chilling story. While it is slow at points, the acting and production is excellent. It's a timeless classic of courage and conviction."
5,not as scary as the book,I read a book about the crime of killing Karen Silkwood. I found it was very scary. Somehow because I have only seen nuclear weapons on TV the video wasn't able to scare me much.The book and the film too had that other element that is the career of a typical North American chemistry student.The nuclear chemistry industry is a very strange place to work.The film also shows typical seventies film making style. Although not a great one it is still layed back and realistic.
2,Way too long,"Of course some information about Karen Silkwood is necessary to ground the movie, but way too much time was spent on her personal background (boyfriend and roommate), which was not particularly interesting. Eg. wordless scenes were dragged out too long. The ending was far too abrupt, especially the closing words on the black screen ""The plant closed a year after her death."" Well, why??? Give us some info! And the singing of all the verses of Amazing Grace was interminable, particularly as it had absolutely nothing to do with the story or her character. It's just a sad song. After hearing about this movie for years, I was disappointed."
2,An average flick about a fascinating subject.,"I found the film entertaining only because I find the topic absolutely compelling. Streep, Russell and Cher turn in very average performances, but in all fairness they were portraying very average people. The big mystery is not who killed Karen Silkwood but how did Meryl Streep get an Oscar nomination for this? Musta been a slow year the the movies. I found it ironic that the lead character in the film was so concerned about the carcinogenic dangers of plutonium while she chain smoked through the entirety of the film. As I have said, the story is compelling. The movie doesn't parallel the events very closely as they really took place, and when it does follow fact it barely scrapes the surface. I have just finished the *excellent* book ""The Killing Of Karen Silkwood"" by Richard Rashke and I heartily recommend it to any Silkwood buff who is interested in the whole story. It'll scare the daylights out of you."
5,Tip for a longer lasting HC-14 filter,This Replacement filter works perfectly on my Honeywell HCM-6000. I found that the filter will last longer if you flip it every other water fill up. This will not allow any one side to stay in the water too long and turn sour.
1,Price discrepancy,"There seems to be a price discrepancy. I ordered this product at $31.99 each, but when it was delivered it was the same as a similar filter that is listed for $9.99. There are two different products shown at this site that are both called Honeywell HC-14 Filter E. In fact, they are the same product listed at two different prices. Do not buy the product shown in the ad because it is priced $22 more than it should be. Buy the one listed for $9.99."
2,Save your money and don't by these filters,"I had several of these filters and one of them didn't even last a week. What happens is that after the water has wicked up in them the absorbent material breaks all the way around about an inch up so that water can no longer wick its way to the top. save your money and look for a good equivalent filter online. I found mine at filtersfast.com the honeywell filters seem to have a manufacturing issue at least in my professional opinion. On the positive side, I did call Kaz who manufactures these filters and they sent me a replacement for my trouble so if you heed my warning and purchase them anyway do call and complain if you have an issue."
3,HC-14 Filters for HCM-6009 Humidifier,"This product works fine, it is the original filter. The only downside is that I paid 2 times what i had to pay elsewhere."
4,works well,the replacement works as it should after only about 2 weeks I started to notice mold growing on the wick.I went online and found out I can use either watered down bleach or vinegar in a bucket and it would remove all the mold and I can reuse it.
3,Argh - didn't fit my Honeywell humidifier.,"My stupid Honeywell humidifier does not have a marking on it saying what model it is. So when I ordered this filter, I assumed that their filters were universal.Well, they're not. Argh."
2,Stuck buying these over and over,This filter is pretty pricey compared to others and I have yet to get more than one season out of it. I only use my humidifier during the winter and I will be looking to get a replacement next fall. There does not appear to be a way to clean it. The first few weeks the thing works great then the absorbancy appears to taper off as time goes on.
3,honeywell hc-14,"the filter is just okay. In general it is more pricy than other filters, and mineral will build up at the end of the season. need to come up with a different design that will reduce this kind of mineral build up."
4,honeywell hc-14 replacement filter,"The picture of the filter is misleading, it has an additional blue layer on the exterior of item. Filter appears to do the job. For my hard water I flip the filter for a longer life."
2,Filter Separated,Filter worked great for about a month and then suddenly it justseparated and would not maintain its ability to soak up the water- it just dried up.I dont know if its because I let it dry out once but I resoaked the filterand placed it back in the humidifier and it quickly dried out again.Im going to try again - the price is right so hopefully its a one time problem.
3,Buyer beware...,"My wife bought five of these filters recently from Dealyard. We received all five filters from them, but only two of them had the air filter feature that is listed in the item description. The other three must have been a much older version which will function as a humidifier filter but will do nothing to filter the air, similar to the original Holmes replacement filter. They all had the same part number (HC-14) listed on the box, but the two boxes are totally different.Previously, we have bought these filters directly from Amazon and they have all included the air filter element, which we like. Needless to say, we were mildly disappointed.Dealyard is known as a clearance item retailer, so who knows how old these filters are? Be warned: if you buy from Dealyard you may not receive what you are expecting."
2,Not an OEM filter...,"This is not a ""Honeywell HC-14 Replacement Filter"", it is a replacement for a Honeywell HC-14 filter. Not the most straightforward description from the seller. That said, for all I know, it's a better item. I need the item, so I guess I'll find out about the quality."
1,Price Gouging!,I used to buy these from Amazon all the time but not anymore... not at over 20 bucks. Especially since I just picked one up at Target for 10 bucks. Amazon should be ASHAMED!!!
5,humidifier,"as filter is identical to the original it's equally efficient. it lasts about twice as long as less expensive filters, although not nearly as long as i'd hoped. we have extremely hard water"
4,works as advertised,"i'm on my second wick filter at this point and have no problems with them. they do discolor a bit in my humidifier at the top end (turns to a brown color) but there is no smell or visible mildew, so it must just be some minerals in the tap water that collect at the top end of the filter where the water evaporates. I am pleased with the performance and longevity of this product"
5,listener,"This soundtrack is awesome. The very last song, was a song that a lot of people could relate to. The words tell the complete story of a lost love in any circumstance."
3,Where is Volume 2?!,"...There are so many songs that are not on the CD!! What the company should have done is released the soundtrack as a double-CD with ALL the songs! I would have definitely bought it, but now I'm not so sure. I'm in my mid-thirties, and I miss all the ""old-school"" jams!!"
4,Name of song,I am looking for the name of that song by Maxwell that was played when Q and MOnica made love after the Spring Dance. Please e msil me and let me know where I can find it.
4,Not Bad,"Thank you, thank you, thank you to whomever was responsible for adding Me'Shell N'degeocello's enormous talent to this soundtrack and to the film. The use of her song was absolutely perfect for that particular scene. For those who don't know, Bitter was one of the best (and most slept on) albums of 1999. If you like that track I encourage you to pick up that album. I also lament the exclusion of the Maxwell track from this collection. Add that one and it easily gets 5 stars from me."
3,where's all that great music?,"i saw the movie and was very impressed with the music, so i went and bought the soundtrack. i was kind of disappointed when half the songs i purchacsed the sound track for were missing. like the marvin gaye song for example. it would have been perfect if the marvin gaye track was on the cd, not to mention maxwell and new edition. all in all it is a pretty decent cd. meshell ndegeocello, chaka khan and al green make up for what is missing."
3,PLEASE HELP,"DOES ANYONE KNOW THE NAME OF THE SONG THAT PLAYED AS THE CREDITS WERE ROLLING.......I THINK IT WENT"" I FLY, I SOAR.....SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK THE TITLE IS MORNING STAR. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY INFORMATION I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT, I LOVE THAT SONG!! JUST EMAIL ME THE INFO..........THANKS"
4,Need to know a song,"Ok here's the deal. 1st..I thought the movie was great! Being that I play ball also for my school i could relate to what was happening and how she was feeling. Anyways I liked the movie so much that I went out and bought the soundtrack. I do like it but there are, I feel, some songs missing that should be on there. So if anyone knows this 1 particular song that I am looking for if you could email me I would be so greatful! I really dont know the words to the song but it is being played when she is at college practicing by herself dribbling the 2 basketballs. I think that it is a great uplifting song and I would love to find it! So, if anyone knows that song could you please email me and let me know as well. Thank you. Hollace_42@hotmail.com"
4,QUESTION ABOUT A SONG,"I REALLY LOVED THE SOUNDTRACK. IT WAS TIGHT! IT HAD A GREAT BLEND OF THE OLD SCHOOL AND NEW. I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT ONE OF THE SONGS THAT WAS NOT ON THE SOUNDTRACK. IT PLAYED IN THE MOVIE TRAILOR WHEN LATHAAN WAS BEING INTRODUCED IN THE WNBA. I ALSO HEARD THIS SONG IN THE MOVIE WHEN LATHAAN WAS TRAINING ON HER OWN IN THE GYM DRIBBLING TWO BASKETBALLS. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHO SINGS THIS SONG PLEASE LET ME KNOW. IT WAS A WOMAN, THAT IS ALL I KNOW. OTHER THAN THAT THE SOUNDTRACK WAS THE BOMB. MY JAM IS ""I WANNA BE YOUR MAN."""
3,Just want to thank everyone......,Hey everyone! Thanks for letting me know that the song I wanted is by Maxwell......I too agree that it should have been included in the soundtrack
3,The Love Song,"If you are looking for the love song from this movie (the one from the commercial), it is called ""This Woman's Work"" by Maxwell and appears on his MTV Unplugged CD..."
4,Love and Basketball Soundtrack,"Great CD! The songs in the movie really ""took me back"". But I too purchased this CD because of the song that was playing durgin the love scene and it is NOT on the soundtrack. Does anyone know the name of that song, who sings it and where I can get it? Other than that song being missing the Soundtrack is great."
3,Pretty Good,"I Thought Maxwell was on here as well.However The Lucy pearl cut was alright sounds just like old Tony,Toni Tone.ROger,Guy,AL GREEN,Rufus Chaka Khan,Me Sh'ShellNDEOCELLO Cuts WOrk.ANgie Stone's Version Of Holding Back The Years is So-So.Her VOIce is Cool but the songs really Doesn't go anywhere.The rest of the disc is so-so at best.but if they had have put that Maxwell Sounding cut on it may have been better."
3,Love & Basketball,The Cd was ok but I only wanted it because of Maxwell's song. I was surprised it wasn't on the Cd. It's the most important song.
4,need to find a song title and artist name,i was wondering if anyone new the name of the song and the artist name of the song playing when quincey and monica make love for the first time I love the music and can't figure out what its called please e-mail me with the title at sundae7786@aol.com
1,Re. missing song,"I am also looking for ""I should be crying"" for over a year but I can't find it. Maybe someone will see our notes. I am getting sick of companies using songs on the trailer and then not putting them in the movie or soundtrack. It took me two months to find the song they used on the Ever After trailer."
4,Missing Song,"What is the song at the end of the movie trailer? Some of the words are, ""I should be crying, but I just can't let it show."" I would appreciate any help in discovering the song and the artist."
2,disappointed,it doesnt put out much warmth guess i expected somthing closer to heat pad it more like a spot that doesnt drain your warmth
4,leading the way,"This must be one of the most influential books I've ever read- but quietly so. A friend lent me a copy- then I bought mine. I found it difficult for the 1st 20 pages, maybe the different cultural approach, BUT THEN IT CLICKED, and I understood what Wolf Moodance was teaching me, how she led me through to self discovery, explaining the trials and hurdles- and how to overcome them,to feel comfortable about a spiritual side long denied. A copy of this book will always be treasured, and read many times. I've now bought another by her."
4,Magic cover-up for leg problems,"Some of the really bad veins, age spots, etc. you develop with age (and too much sun in your youth) make short pants seems inappropriate. Well, this cover up is really great. The only word of warning. While I'm very pale - very pale! - this lightest cover up was TOO light. My leg color, as with most people, gets more exposure and therefore is darker in tone. So you need to order 1 or 2 shades darker than you probably initially think you should if you spend any time without spending it in sun block. And while it took just a little bit longer than expected to get, overall I'm ok with the results as I can use the cover elsewhere on my body. I've already ordered and received a darker shade for my legs and I've already used it. And it doesn't rub off on anything!"
1,Terrible coverup,I tried this product because I was taking a vacation on a beach for the first time. I have not worn shorts in public for many years and I tried this to cover up imperfections on my legs. The color was waaaaaay too pink and did not blend in at all! The product also did come off on my clothes. I tried patting it in as much as I could before taking it all back off again and it still rubbed off on my clothes. A complete waste of money.
5,JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,"I love this product! It keeps my legs looking immaculate and does not rub off on my clothes, like the Sally Hansen brand did. It's also a great shade. I got the Very Light. I am fair-skinned and most brands are far too dark on me. This matches perfectly!"
5,Hide Scars and Stretch Marks with This Product,"This product was a Godsend until my stretchmarks faded! I have fair- but not porcelain- skin and ""Very Light"" blended well on the lightest part of my arm (test spot.) Go a shade darker if you're planning to use it on skin areas that stay tan. It does have pink undertones as others have mentioned but it is super blendable, stays on for up to a few days (even with showers), waterproof but nothing a good scrubbing won't cure. I felt much more confident going to the beach with this product safely hiding stretchmarks. I don't think you have to purchase the setting powder or primer; I have used it in hot, humid climates and it held up just fine. It doesn't flake off."
3,Extremely hardcore,"This is extremely heavy-duty stuff! It really sticks to your legs and is hard to get blended because it is so heavy and sticky. It is also extremely light, as other reviewers have mentioned. Very hard to wash off. It does make my legs look better than without, but it's too heavy for my tastes. I am the palest person i know and it is still too white for my skin tone."
1,Absurdly Boring with Little Character Development,"Most of the folks reviewing this film seem to have been searching for it out of a fond childhood memory. If you like really dry, old-fashioned British humor, maybe you will like this film?However, I found this film to be absurdly boring. All of the girls in the film are completely undeveloped caricatures. The only developed character in the film is Sims. Of course Alistair Sims is a wonderful actor, but his voice can be grating when there is no other focus.This is one of the few classic films where I actually preferred the remake. This film barely has a plot. At least in the remake the every single scene isn't focused on the Fritton character.Don't get me wrong- I actually love British humor and classic films, but the humor in this film was a little too dry and the pace was a little too slow. Not to mention, the film quality (washed-out b&w; picture quality and horrendously low budget sound) gives me a LITERAL migraine."
4,A Feast for Fans of British Farce,"This film has appeal to a particular audience: fans of true Brit farce, with a tale of private English girls' school featuring (among other things) an on-site bookie, stills in the chemistry lab and a race horse concealed in the dormitory. Alastair Sim is at his best in dual roles of the headmistress and her twin brother. Again, this type of film has ""niche"" appeal, but for those who appreciate this kind of cinema it is a real treat!"
2,Lacking in longevity,"I bought these boots in the middle of December, and found them to be very well suited to what I needed them for (working as a cart attendant in western Michigan). Unfortunately, over the last month and a half, they have developed a number of problems of varying severity have ensued (listed in chronological order):1) The insoles that were included in the boot wore out within a week of their arrival. Not a big deal, but it did make the boots rather uncomfortable until I could replace them.2) One of the eyelets yanked out of the leather. This didn't impede my ability to wear them any.3) One of the laces broke, which was of course easily replaced.4) Holes began to develop in the sole. It is at the point now where they need to replaced soon.Now, I walk pigeon toed and I am particularly hard on shoes, but 1.5 months seems to be a very short life span. I've gotten a longer lifetime out of my cheap wal-mart tennis shoes."
1,Do Not Buy!!!!!!!,"I bought these for my husband who loved them when he first tried them on. After the second time using them the sole came apart! They are flat and now cause him back pain. We bought inserts but they can only do so much. The boot is also not as warm as you would think.Overall, not worth the money! Spend a little bit more for a durable boot. I am very dissappointed with this purchase."
4,for occasional bad weather; great,"we are here in northern Az and we get a few good snow storms a year. for that I need a pair of dependable ""winter boots"" to get me to the office a few times during the winter. these work great for that. they are not fancy nor are they super comfortable but to get you from here to there in a snow storm you can't go wrong, especially at the low price of these boots."
5,Men's Itasca Icebreaker Boots,"The quality is excellent on the ""Men's Itasca Icebreaker boots"". The shipping was expedient and we would definitely recommend the item and Amazon. We look forward to future purchases."
5,A must for engineering statistics,"If you are doing an engineering statistics course this book is of a hell of a lot more value than Engineering Statistics by Hubele, Montgomery and Runger.This book teaches you how to do statistics using excel.Should be aplicable for most statistics but is of greatassistance if your doing Engineering statistics and get stuck without much support."
4,The Norton Book of Personal Essays,"Brilliant. The volume covers some of the most engaging writers known for fiction and/or nonfiction. My only complaint is that I would have enjoyed seeing work by writers from non-Western countries. Some are represented here, but I believe they are naturalized citizens of the US."
5,HGHLY RECOMMENDED SERVICE.,The book I purchased was timely delivered. The quality of the book was as described. Excellent condition. The price was great!
4,Excellent Debut,"Great first album. If you want simple good country songs with heart, meaning and fun, look no furthur!! No dissapointment here!!"
5,Go Amanda,"Wow, I can't beleive I didn't know about this artist earlier. She is amazing and I'll be watching for more albums with her name on them. You need this CD."
3,Gaiam always seems overpriced to me,"I bought two small recycled flip-flop doormats from BB&B. The price was $15 each and I used that 20% off coupon they mail to you, so I paid less than $15 each. The ones I bought are made up of bright cheerful colors and I like seeing them in front of our front door and our kitchen door. I have three kids using them along with all their friends in the neighborhood."
5,Just fantastic!,"A British friend introduced me to Slow Train and I must say since I have purchased this CD, it has not left my CD player!This is soulful lounge music! ""Twisted Cupid"" is just hypnotic! If you are a fan of Hotel Costes then you will be more that happy you invested in this CD."
3,Lounge stuff,"I wanted this CD primarily because I love the sound of the Theremin. It's here alright, but a little too clean. Not pulsating ghostly the way I like it in so many 1940s films.The music is good; the lounge singer is decent and quite retro. And who knew there were lyrics to the 1966 Star Trek TV theme?! I think I would have enjoyed this more if it were an anthology of different singers and musicians for each track.I'm keeping it in my collection, for now. (And thanks Chad!)"
2,Sodium content of foods,"I found this book to be limited in it's range.Many items are listed accoring to the producers such asCampbells,Planters etc. Not helpful if you don't use thosebrands.Also many items related to ""fast food"". Not helpful if youdon't buy ""fast food""."
2,Ultimate Risk? Maybe not,"It is a decent book, but not nearly as exciting nor risky as the title states. The author also chooses to bash American's every chance he gets. YMMV"
3,Snooze Fest,Not very compelling or very interesting.Actually got no feel for the dangers of combat nor was the story told well.
5,A Genuine Classic on Social Class,"This novel stands far above most contemporary American literature. It's an intricate, smoothly allegorical warning about the dangers of climbing our society's class ladder. The network of allegorical symbolism works beautifully. And, along with that, the characters are highly credible as human beings whose thoughts and feelings deserve our sympathy. Except those dastardly Luther Nedeeds, of course, whose devil-like natures make them perfect, yet also perfectly tempting, occupants of the lowest circle of Naylor's Inferno. If you find this novel confusing at first, stick with it--the whole structure, a visit downward through various contemporary temptations and their potential costs--will become clear soon enough. Love, love, and love--that's where this book finally finds salvation. (Great companion piece: Where We Stand: Class Matters, by bell hooks.)"
4,A Black Version of 'The Stepford Wives',"This book reminded me of a black version ofThe Stepford Wives. It is an allegorical tale of an upper class black community, mythical in quality, that is populated by people that have given up all tat is important to them in order to live there. They have given up their values and true feelings so as to fit in with what is required at Linden Hills.Linden Hills is ruled/owned by one Luther Nedeed. In fact, it has been ruled by one Luther Nedeed after another - a generational perpetuation. This Nedeed locks his wife in the basement because he thinks their son is not really his. The son dies and eventually his wife ascends the stairs and a tragic even occurs.Nedeed has given the homes in Linden Hills to people who fit his image of who should be living there. Sound creepy? It is."
4,Who else pays attention to Dante?,"Yeah, all that stuff those other people above me said is (mostly) true. But the thing that sets this book apart is that it is a mirror of Dante's inferno. remember reading that in high school? Linden Hills in Naylor's hell. It's all here...wandering poet led by an inhabitant of hell...different levels of sin and punishment...and a devil at the bottom. This may be the closest thing to epic that comes out of the 20th century. nuf said."
3,Too involved for me.,"LINDEN HILLS was a very involved novel that bordered on lost and found. I was lost on several chapters and found my way back in the next. The story of blacks who made it and the blacks who hadn't was a good one, however, the point would have been better if it hadn't dragged on for so long with filler chapters and constant talking between the lines. Still, only if you have the time to kill, should you give it a try."
5,Don't Wait,"One cannot undo a miserable 1 star review by another reviewer who has not seen the blu-ray release, as his rating will forever drag down the average, but I can at least counter it with an offsetting rating, which at the time of this writing will produce an average 3 stars.Rebecca is a great classic movie, and if you're reading this, you are probably already familiar with the production. If not: check it out.Given it's origins, year of production, film stock, editing, etc. etc. - there is no way that a blu-ray treatment can be harmful. Sure, we all want loads of extras, but even if there is no menu, that doesn't mean the picture won't be great quality.If it comes out in 2.0 stereo, well, that's better than when folks saw [heard] it for the first time. (original mono: Western Electric Recording)So there.(ps: I pre-ordered it, and there is no link for verified purchase - so how the other reviewer got a verified purchase tag is beyond me)"
4,"""Happiness is something I know nothing about.""","This was Alfred Hitchcock's first American film and stars Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. Olivier and Fontaine have married rather hastily, and Olivier's dead first wife (Rebecca), who from appearances one assumes he loved very much, provides the chief stumbling block for Fontaine in ever capturing Olivier's love. But it's soon revealed that he never loved Rebecca, but hated her; in fact, killed her. Rebecca's dead body being discovered after a number of years have passed is a bit hard to believe, but from that point on the picture really rolls. There is a legal inquiry, attempted blackmail, and arson committed by the jealous housekeeper (Judith Anderson), who is deliciously wicked. The movie is a tad too long (over two hours), but the last hour is excellent. Definitely worth a watch."
3,"not bad, but also not true to the book","I read the book by Daphne Du Maurier and loved it. I knew I had to see the movie after that; the story was that good. The movie isn't bad on its own, but if you are expecting a true adaptation of the book you may be disappointed with some of the liberties taken with the film. Did you know the Hitchcock classic ""The Birds"" was based on a novella by Du Maurier?? Interesting piece of trivia I just recently learned."
3,Special Features Best Viewed On Computer,"Allow me to preface my review by stating that Rebecca is my absolute favorite movie. When I heard about the release of this DVD with all of the special features, I ordered it immediately and could hardly wait for it to arrive in the mail. When I popped in the special features DVD, my bubble of excitement suddenly burst. The features were mostly stills and audio recordings, which is great if you are in front of a computer, but not so great when you're lying on the couch.Watching the actual film with the restoration of sound and images was a treat, and I am grateful to the folks who restored this film. Now Rebecca is forever safe from the fate of all celluloid. This, alone, is worth the price of admission."
5,Classic Favorite,"I've read the book several times. The first time I was a teenager and I related to the shyness of the second Mrs. DeWinter. Now I'm old and not so shy, but still loved the book when I read it last year. I now see that Max is a brute in many ways, but that doesn't take away from the story for me. He fits his station in life for the period. He also carries a dark secret that affects his conscience. So he broods. The story haunts me. How the past can reek havoc on the present. Mrs. Danvers is delicious. Rebecca is evil. It's a perfect tale for my taste and I still love it. The movie varies slightly from the book, but stays true."
5,Another really great Criterion disc,"Actually two discs. Once again, Criterion has really done it right. The extras here are extensive. The screen tests of the actresses for the main role of ""I"", are really fascinating. Anne Baxter, Loretta Young, Vivien Leigh, Margaret Sullavan, and finally Joan Fontaine...It provides a glimpse of the old Hollywood casting process; gives us an opportunity to watch how each of these actresses brings her own unique qualities to the same scene. Finally, it allows us to dream how the balance of the relationships in the movie might have turned out had one of the other women gotten the part...Fun to see all the options that were in front of the casting people...Really interesting.This is one of my favorite movies and I am relishing the experience of looking at it from all the different angles provided here."
2,Masterpiece BUT The Criterion DVD was better,"I'm quite curious what happened to all the wonderful screen tests and costume and makeup test which are 90% missing from THIS new MGM Fox version. Not to mention all the stills, the documentary, original commentary, etc etc etc. How sad to double dip..."
5,An amazing movie!!!!!!,"I have always loved the novel REBECCA. It is a pure example of classic talent! Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are William Shakespeare's present day Romeo and Juliet! The love, struggle, and passion between the two throughout the movie is a prime example of strength, determination, and the power that is needed to hold one's relationship together!This DVD captures their love and the passion of REBECCA in more ways then one. There's nothing more explicit then watching this suspensful yet awaking romance on DVD. The entire movie is captured ten times better by it. REBECCA is a movie that must be followed every step of the way to be experienced and endured to its fullest, and this DVD does it with no hesitation! I highly recommend this DVD, REBECCA!"
5,Great classic film by Hitchcock,"This is based on the classic love and mystery story of good and evil, missing information revealed, and a surprise ending that is an edge of you seat thriller! In black and white with a really excellent cast and flawless direction by the master himself."
5,Very happy with this product. It arrived quickly and seems to be a long lasting printer cartridge for my canon printer.,"Purchased as a gift for my wife, she is very pleased with this movie and greatly enjoys it. Couldn't be better."
3,Product Details say that WHO stars in this?!!,"If anyone already owns this, please tell me if this is FOR SURE the Rebecca that stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier. The picture shows them, but the product details describe a bunch of actors I've never heard of and who are definitely NOT in the Hitchcock Rebecca that the picture shows. HELP!!"
5,not exactly my cup of tea,but I have to give respect where its due.I truly loved the haunting opening sequence. And I was consistantly amazed by the cinematography.Some of the performaces were semi dated. But often impressive and overall quite satisfying. The pacing was dead on. The plot is a bit of a cliche - bluebeard with a twist. But the execution and tone are so classy and elegent you almost forget its a b-movie comic book type of story.
5,Excellent,This is the first time I used this seller and I give him/her five stars!I received my dvd as discribed and within a few days! What morecan I asked for? I definitely would use again!Good job...seller!
5,One of my all-time favorite Hitchcock movies,"If you want to see Hitchcock at his best, then you must see ""Rebecca"". The lighting, directing subtleties, innuendo, and overall suspensefulness of the movie will captivate you. Laurence Olivier is brilliant as Maxim deWinter: amazingly handsome, dashing and brooding at once. Joan Fontaine is perfect as the naive second Mrs. deWinter, and Dame Judith Anderson will send chills down your spine as the obsessed ""Danny"". Watch this movie once, and you will watch it again and again, and find yourself recommending it to your friends."
4,Review of Rececca DVD,"I read the book and couldn't put it down until I finished it. After reading the book I wanted to see the movie so ordered it from Amazon. The movie, unlike most movies, closely followed the book's story. Hitchcok directs in his usually superb way. Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine turned in excellent performances. I would recommend this movie to anyone but also would suggest ordering the book as well. I always get more out of a book than a movie."
1,*poit* :|,"All you people who said this is good are crazy! This movie was even worse than the novel! (something i thought was impossible!) hell, the guy playing Maxim can't act! so i say BOO TO YOU! BOOOOOO! .... have a nice day :)"
5,REBECCA,This version of Rebecca was exquisite. It is how the book is written. Anyone that has not read the book or seen the movie definatly needs to. The 2nd Mrs. De Winter was beautiful and Maxim and the 2nd Mrs. De Winter were played wonderfully in this movie. It was the best movie by far. My friends and I love watching it. We watch it over and over. We all agree it is as good as the book.
3,REBECCA,"When I buy these great classic movies, I expect to see the the director's vision up on the screen, with no editing and with the original screen size. With Rebecca, I feel short-changed. While watching the included special feature, ""The Making of Rebecca"", which showed some clips from the film, I suddenly realized that this dvd doesn't show Rebecca in its original screen shape. The film shape in the clips are much taller and deeper. This is a movie about entering mysterious new worlds. The taller size allows the viewer to feel as though he is entering these new realms with the new Mrs. de Winter, as no doubt intended by the director. The film in this dvd version has had the top/bottom of the frame cut by at least 25%. The package says that the film is the full frame version. I don't really understand what that means."
5,Still a classic,"""Rebecca"" is a classic movie that has stood the test of time. I loved it and so did my teenage daughter and her girlfriends. The story is wonderful and the acting is excellent. A winner all around."
5,hitchcock at his best!!,"Great movie adaptation of Daphne du Maurier novel, funny at times, but tragic and surreal. This is the kind of movie Hollywood forgot how to make a long time ago, where you can just get caught up in a mesmerizing story. I can't think of another story where an unseen character plays a more important role."
1,Great movie but terrible DVD,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. However, I purchased this ""collectors edition version"" and was suprised and annoyed to find it came with Japanese subtitles (quite distracting), a sound track that did not match the video exactly (also quite distracting), and a hilarious Japanese interpretation of the story line for ""Lubeka"" on the cover. For the price I paid, I expected much more than a ""knock-off""."
2,Is this Region 1?,I am trying to get a DVD of Rebecca. The information on this DVD is not complete. Please tell us more about this release. Thank you.
3,Request for writers to check their spelling before posting reviews,"While much of the commentary on the film Rebecca is interesting and helpful, I find it most annoying to frequently encounter misspellings and malapropisms. If you want to write a well thought-out piece that readers will take seriously, you really should pay close attention to writing correctly. Errors detract from the message and annoy the reader. With the proliferation of opportunities for people to contribute to online written forums such as this, people tend to get lax about spelling. As an example to students who pass through and out of respect for our own English language, let's use a dictionary and get it right."
1,Moronic trash!,"I am now truly convinced that Hitchcock is THE most overrated director of all time! This movie is about as provocative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. The music was poorly placed and way overused! With the exception of Fontaine, the acting was wretched. The plot revelations were so hokey I actually broke out laughing a few times. Other than some interesting lighting and photography (which you can see in probably a million other thrillers), the movie went absolutely nowhere--no real tension, plodding development, and an astonishing lack of credibilty. Perhaps this movie is more an influence of Selznick than Hitchcock, but ironically, a man by the name of Val Lewton, who worked under Selznick, went on to do some of the greatest thriller/horror movies ever!"
1,Cover Art?,After waiting a very long time for Hitchcock to appear on blu ray I'm very surprised by the bad cover art. Instead of vintage poster art like Psycho it looks like the future covers are stills from the movies - stills that don't say or express much of anything. On the Spellbound cover you can't even see Peck's or Bergman's face.Here's hoping that the dics are well transferred.
1,ugh!,"How can anyone write a good review of this movie? It does not even come close to doing justice to du Maurier's classic novel! Anyone who has read the novel knows the importance of what happens in the cabin that stormy night, and the movie RUINS IT.My rating: -5 stars."
5,Rebecca,"I love this film. Rebecca is a classic film with everything, a rags to riches love story, a murder, suicide, gossip, & Lawrence Olivier. I just love the forbidding, malevolent, overbearing housekeep. The whole story about Rebecca, a woman you never see and whose presence never leaves the story. Joan Fontaine is great as the hapless, naive girl who marries the worldly Olivier. The suspense just keeps on building throughout about the death of Rebecca, was it suicide or murder. Is Olivier guilty or not. Will the lovers be torn apart by the specter of Rebecca. An amazing movie that does not disappoint."
4,"Good movie, but the new version portrayed characters better","I enjoyed this movie. At first, I thought it really wasn't very good, but the second time I saw it, I realized it was much better than I thought. It was well-filmed and suitably chilling, and most of the performances were good. Still, I think the new version that Masterpiece Theater did a few years ago gave better portrayals of the characters. Judith Anderson was good as Mrs. Danvers, but Diana Rigg was more chilling, espicially in the ""Why don't you jump?"" scene. In this version, Laurence Olivier gave a pretty weak portrayal, I thought, and Charles Dance gave a much more complex portrayal of Maxim de Winter. Joan Fontaine was suitably naive as Mrs. de Winter, but I think Emilia Fox did a better job. Better portrayals in the Masterpiece Theater version, but otherwise, this was a good film."
4,A great movie!,"What can I say ""Beautiful, Romantic, alot like Jane Eyre?"" Athough it is alot like Jane Eyre ya know ""Plain not very rich girl that lives with a brudy old lady, Somewhat handsome rich guy who has a mysterious past, and a buring house"" that's not all though. But I loved the movie... Probably because I love Jane Eyre..."
2,Not for me,"I will admit, I was not impressed with this film. It just did not work for me. The entire time I was thinking when will it end? I'm sure others will enjoy it. But it was too slow of a storyline to keep me wanting to watch it or care about the key players."
3,Not one of Hitch's masterpieces,"Rebecca (1940) is the only film directed by Alfred Hitchcock that won an Oscar as best picture and it is also his first american film. It certainly has many of Hitch's trademarks (the opening sequence for example)but imho it is an overrated film, the performances are dull with the exceptcion of Judith Anderson`s role and the script is weak. Suspicion , Notorius , Strangers on a Train are by far better films in which the Master of Suspense displays all his genius. Sincerely I expected a more interesting film."
2,Bearing Away,"All in all, classic video games have truly been a part of our arcades for decades beyond imagination. Yet, there are some video games that really seem to set in the opposite direction. One game from Atari, really was one of those games now. Crystal Classics enjoyed moderate but not die hard success in the 80's. The game is a bit like a knock off to Pac Man, as you guide a bear throughout a maze-like castle, grabbing gems on the floor, and trying to avoid bees, and ghoulish villians to garner points. All in all, the game was fair, but this version is really not one worth purchasing. I strongly suggest you buy the Atari Anniversary Edition or the deluxe edition which includes over 80 different games, including Crystal Castles. This version of the game on CD-ROM isn't worth the money."
5,So glad I found this,I remembered playing with this game so much at the Arcade in the late 80s. Later I even found a roller ball controller for this game just like the original arcade. Jewel case? Just plan old plastic cover with cd for pc.
2,Disappointed,"The pictured showed two mallets but we only received one. It was a birthday present, so now I have to find other mallets at a music store in the area. Is it so hard to make sure everything is included when packaging? I was very disappointed with it."
2,Negative Overtones,"My husband and I were disappointed with this drum. We wanted to get a nice floor drum for my young niece, but this drum had a very pronounced and negative high-pitched, ringing overtone. My husband (who happens to be a Juilliard trained percussionist) tried to mute the overtone it by taping a small amount of foam to one corner, but we could not get rid of it, and the ringing sound was pretty annoying. Otherwise, the drum is very well made and sturdy (we own several other Remo drums). We later returned this drum and ordered the larger 22"" x 8"" Remo Gathering Drum which due to the larger drum head, had a lower, warmer, and more pleasant tone. We realize this is for a toddler, but why not start them off hearing a rich, resonant drum that they can enjoy for years to come, and one which won't give the parents a headache. I would recommend splurging and getting the larger (wider) drum instead."
5,Highly Recommend,Was the perfect gift for my 1-yr old nephew. He loved it immediately. I'm already looking at which Remo product to send him next.
5,My son loves this drum!,My 2 year old enjoys banging this drum at his Music Together class. I can't wait to see his face when he opens this one (same as the one he uses at class) on Christmas morning. These drums are high quality and built to last.FYI - There are two mallets in the box with this - even though the picture only shows one. Just wanted people to know because the Amazon suggestion for things people buy with this is an extra mallet...but it already comes with two.
4,great quality,They had this drum at my baby's daycare and he loves it there so I bought one for our home. He loves banging on it and it is a great quality item - will last a long time.
4,It is a great toy !,"My 17 months baby boy likes drums so he play with this drum every day ! It is well done and comes with 2 mallets ! I like it, too !!!"
4,A big hit with my 2 year old ...,Hesitant about spending so much money on a toy drum but based on excellent reviews I'm glad that I did. Seems much better quality and sound than other plastic drum choices out there so I hope it will last for many years to come. Keeping a budding musician happy while not giving mom and dad a headache which is a plus! Important note: Description and some reviews state that only one mallet is included but this floor tom drum came with 2 mallets (maybe a manufacturer improvement somehwere along the line) so I'm glad that I did not buy an extra mallet at time of purchase. Very happy with purchase and would definitely recommend and buy Remo products again.
5,My son loves it,This drum is great. My son loves it. It's well put together and puts up with a lot of rough and tumble from my 3 year old.
5,one of our favorite presents ever,"We bought this for our two year old music loving boy. He LOVES this drum. This is not a fake toy drum that sounds terrible and will break in a few months. Remo is a respected maker of amateur and professional drums for adults, so this is a real instrument. It sounds good and is very sturdy. And most of all, toddlers LOVE it."
5,Come with 2 mallets!,I bought an extra mallet at the same time as I bought the drum because there was only one pictured. It was not clear to me. The drum actually comes with two mallets so no need to buy an extra!
4,Remo Kids Floor Tom,"This is a wonderful gift for a child. I purchased it for a one and half year old and he plays it a lot. It came with two mallets and if you purchase one be sure it has two mallets. I have taught drumming for over thirty years and the quality, size and sound are fine for a child."
5,Best drum for kids,Our sons immediately loved playing with this drum together. Watch the drum sticks! our dog loves to try and chew them!great purchase
4,FANTASTIC DRUM,"My 2 year old loves this drum. It has a wonderful rich sound, and you can beat it with your hands or the mallets it comes with. He can play it loud or soft, but it never gets annoying to listen to because of the full sound it makes. I am a music teacher, and I use remo drums in my class rooms because they are so beautiful sounding.Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath"
4,reminds me of old tom tom dad made out of rubber tire just updated,love the colors and design with animals for my grand daughter for christmas and the nice drumming sound...juanita good for older kids too.
5,Sound quality is very rich,"We just received this today so this review can't speak to the quality of the drum over time. We are very happy with it. It seems very well made and came with 2 ""drumsticks."" It has a very nice rich tone to it. We bought this for our 2 year old and I can tell that this type of sound will be much easier to listen to than him beating on most cheap toy drums (of course this is not an all the time toy... we will only get it out when we want to play it and then put it away. Great for outside play also)."
5,A great suppliment,"You can't go wrong with Waylon. Although this album doesn't have as many ""hits"" persay as his other albums; it has a lot of great stuff most people tend to overlook. As far as I'm concerned, if Waylon sings it, it's good. I'm very pleased with this album."
1,Absolutely Terrible Song Selection,"As a ""greatest hits"" compilation, this one's an absolute failure. Not one of his major hits is here. There are plenty of other Waylon albums better than this. For newcomers, start with his GREATEST HITS VOL.1, and go from there."
5,Chocolate Aquarium Gravel,"I first tasted this item at the Georgia Aquarium and brought back some as gifts. Once they ran out, everyone was addicted. These are THOSE SAME candy pebbles and they're GREAT! Authentic looking and great tasting."
2,"Color of Rocks not accurate, DON'T BUY FROM Clayton Kendrick INC","I've purchased candy rocks for a party that I host for over 5 years now, and they have always been more muted colors, like brown, beige, and green which is exactly what the product image shows. Unfortunately, what I received was more garish and bright colors of red and tan, with no green at all. I don't want to have to deal with trying to get a replacement for the party in time, so I'm just going to use it, but wanted to warn everyone else who was expecting the product to arrive as pictured. DON'T BUY FROM Clayton Kendrick INC"
5,Best DVD I own!,"This is such a great movie, and the DVD has great extras that make this well worth the money. The audio commentary by Spinal Tap (in character no less) is so funny, I was laughing throughout. This DVD also has music videos and outtakes that are also funny. Spinal Tap alone was a funny movie, the DVD with the added extras (particularly the audio commentary) make this a stellar movie. Also worth seeing are the other two mockumentaries by Christopher Guest (it's the six-fingered man!) and Eugene Levy: Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show."
4,This is Spinal Tap,"If you like dry, hilarious humor, this is it! Absolutely full of surprises and a wonderful movie. (Just remember that it's make-believe...)"
5,Hilarious,This film is a reality check for all those rock bands out there who take themselves SOOOOOOO seriously. Ha!Good on ya Rob Reiner!
4,Start of RockMockumania,"Reiner, Guest and cast team up for this takeoff on bands coming across the pond, bringing along not only talent but barrel of problems as well.From the band manager to girlfriends and inter-personal strife between band members, this is funny for the 60-70's group.McKean is just outstanding in this one. Williard is not the strong character of the followons, but equally good here.Too bad Levy isn't here, maybe as crazed drummer?"
3,"an interesting film, but not my favorite","This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Since I am not a fan of rock music, I am not too familiar with this film.Having watched it, seemed to give me a sense of the 'rockumentary' idea of it. The film itself is not really a documentary since it is a work of fiction. It seems to be somewhat of a comedy, but i did not find it as funny as most comedies I have seen. The Criterion edition is LOADED with special features and is well worth the money for any fan of the movie. ... a great collector's item also.The movie itself was not very comprehensible to me so I find it difficult to do a complete review."
1,Buy the DVD - NOT the VHS.,"Despite Tapster.com and the Spinal Tap website at MGM advertising one hour of new footage on tape and DVD, the VHS version that I ordered, which is the 2000 special edition, does NOT have these additions. This is a hugely funny movie as basically the version that came out in 1982, but this video is not worth buying twice. (It is almost exactly the same as the ""old"" video.) This re-release does not even have the two videos that appeared at the end of the original release. Shame on MGM!Amazon, I note, does correctly identify that the VHS is remastered but that the DVD has additional footage. I should have read Amazon's description and not relied on MGM's ad blitz which even today (September 18th, 2000) still has a note on their website promising 1 hour of new footage on VHS and DVD.They should have done it in Dobly."
1,Tappers beware!,"This DVD apparently had some unspecified mastering problems that almost delayed its release. Maybe MGM should have delayed the release. Not only does the disc booklet not list the film's last three chapters, but the film itself lacks the original on-screen captions identifying characters, places, etc., thus making itself more bewildering. (For some reason, a Tap clip played during Rob Reiner's new interview has the clip's original caption.) Did the filmmakers intentionally remove the captions for this rerelease? If MGM did botch Spinal Tap, will the studio replace our DVDs with corrected copies, and with corrected booklets?"
5,Soon to be re-released!,"I have received word from the Spinal Tap camp that they are planning to re-release this movie in theaters in August with the DVD and VHS to follow shortly after. According to Harry Shearer, a few live shows may take place as well. Stay tuned!"
5,"I have watched many DVD's, but this one takes the cake.","Not only one of the funniest films ever, but the best ""mockumentary"" about rock'n roll ever made. Every rock band in the world, whether famous or not, will have at one time or another, quoted a line out of ""Tap"" & got a giggle during rehearsals. The DVD is another story. A dream for all Spinal Tap freaks. Not just commentary by the band AND the director AND hillarious trailers AND the Hell Hole video AND the famous 20 minute ""demo"" of the movie BUT ALSO over an hour of unbelievable outtakes!!!!! Never has there been a DVD of such quantity & quality. ALL DVD's should be put together like this. Mrs Presley!?"
5,essential for music obsessive types,"This is one DVD where you get your money's worth. All but a few of the extra scenes are fantastic. Especially wonderful are the bits where the band is musing about the speed of elevators and how your neck brakes if you break the sound barrier or the band's philosophising on the diet of gorillas - ""Gorillas - culture, baboons - subculture"". Oh, I forgot about the deleted scene where the Sinatra-obsessed cab driver parties with Spinal Tap.What's great about a DVD is I can pop it in view a selected scene, say, You Can't Dust for Vomit and get a quick laugh."
1,"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid","Stupid and boring. A few good chuckle moments, but primarily a near-post-adolescent bad boy movie. Sound track has problems, many spots where the sound does not sync with the action onscreen. Many sound dropouts.Purchase only if you absolutely need to see the cucumber scene again - and then only if your player has a fast forward scan button - you'll use it alot."
1,this stinks!,i waited and waited for something funny to happen but all i got was bad music and worse jokes. you people that think this is funny should consider adjusting your meds.
1,The most stupid movie I've ever seen next to The Waterboy,This movie is proof that the dumbing down of America is a reality.
1,i am a worse person for watching this movie,'this is spinal tap' is the worst movie i've ever seen. it made me want to stick a pencil in my eye.
1,childish,"It's difficult to come up with words that will do an adequate job of describing this movie but here's one that pretty much says it all:Childish - seeing Lenny (from Laverne and Shirley) speaking with a fake English accent playing air guitar pretty much sums it up.There really isn't anything good to be said about this flick.The music - unimaginative and boring as is the scriptwriting.The humor - (someone mentioned ""deadpan"") isn't deadpan but just dead.The premise - sad and lame... a tasteless ""Rutles"" parody.The acting (if you want to call it that) - juvenile at bestThere is nothing good to be said about this video other than that it points out how worthless image without content is.If Rob Reiner was trying to prove he the real life ""meathead"" `Archie Bunker"" always said he was then bravo! This DVD is a worthless waste of time, effort, energy, plastic and (if you were to buy it) money too."
1,"""A Viewer"" said ...","I must be stupid if I this movie is funny. Well ""A Viewer"" thinks Blair Witch was scary, and Anime is an art form !Did I call YOU stupid, viewer ? I am now !"
5,Phenomenal Disc,"Here's the deal. Shortly after Criterion started releasing this movie, their license to do so ran out. I'm sure if they had the option, they'd pick right back up where they left off.Now, with that said, you should do anything in your power to find a copy of this disc. Pick through e-bay if you have to, and pay the 100 bucks it'll probably cost. It's worth it. The movie is just as great as you remember, and the extras are something that, as a fan, you need to see. Some of the deleted scenes are funny to the point where you'll wonder why they weren't included in the actual movie. Nigel's testing of exotic musical styles nearly had me needing a change of pants."
5,"Love the movie, love the DVD","Maybe it's my weakness for silly humor, but ""This is Spinal Tap"" is easily in my top 5 list of comedies -- and this DVD really completes the whole ""Tap"" experience. The in-character commentary alone is worth the price of the DVD. I'll spare the reader the easy jokes about ""it goes to 11"" and the ""fine line between clever and stupid"" and just recommend this DVD very highly for anyone who needs a guaranteed-to-make-you-laugh comedy."
5,Here lies David St. Hubbins...and why not?,"Brilliant. I've seen this movie countless times...and everytime I see it, I find something new to laugh at. It's really hilarious to watch this, and then flip over to VH-1 and catch ""Behind the Music"".The DVD features almost an entire second movie of outtakes. Some of these are pretty boring and trivial, but there are some great scenes mixed in here (including a fun bit about Derek Smalls' movie career). The DVD also includes the band's ""videos"" and the TV commercial for their greatest hits album (a rip on the K-TEL complitation commercials of the 70's and 80's). Rob Reiner also adds in some humorous promos, in character, as ""Marty DeBergi""."
5,11 is louder than 10,"If you are a rock fan and you have a good sense of humor, then this is the ultimate. The band Spinal Tap comes up with some of the stupidest songs but they can still rock. The Parodies in the movie nail how over the top metal and rock bands can be. I suggest buying this movie because it never gets old and it's just plain good."
5,Still Tapping After All These Years,"This is Spinal Tap is, inarguably, a classic comedy. Now, with the recent trend of brainless teen boppers (Brittney, Christina, Jessica, etc) it has again become all the more relevant. The really great thing about this film is that it's not all about the rock and roll, the truly hilarious observations and conversations come from the trio just being human and having enormous egos. This one definitely deserves a second look, if not only for the classic scenes (Stonehedge, the airport metal detector, Puppet Show and Spinal Tap...) Do yourself a large favor and crank this one to 11 all over again."
2,Complete hack job from a total hack,"No surprise Marti DeBergi wasn't able to get a job after this. He could teach Michael Moore a thing or two about selective editing, turning one of England's most influential rock bands into a troupe of inept buffoons. DeBergi clearly knows nothing about music, and its sad watching him struggle to understand Nigel's technical explanantion of his (then) cutting edge amps. The only reason to recommend this is for the music, which even DeBergi's editors couldn't ruin. Its a shame that this turd has so badly tarnished Tap's reputation, and even caused now-defunct Megaphone records to keep their brilliant catalog out of print."
3,It's alright,"The movie is a cult classic, but there is something wrong with the disc. It will play normally and then all of the sudden mess up for a bit."
4,Spinal Tap,"Spinal Tap is a certified cult classic. like the Blues Brothers, Animal House, etc. Comedies like these can never die and it is foolish for the movie to be unavailable to consumers."
5,Or not so black,"Every line in this movie is funny. If you're a musician, you have been in all these situations. If you're not a musician, well, emmm...So what about the festival on the Isle of Lucy? What is that about? ('I Love Lucy' the Lucille Ball show?)Etc Etc Etc.They even mocked the big loudest amps and the stupid vintage instrument craze. Indeed, if a guitar can no longer be considered 'true vintage' if the tuners have been replaced, then how can it be considered vintage if the original strings and tags aren't on anymore? Hilarious.How about sustain? You can go and have a bite, and come back and it'll still be going 'aaaahhhh'...Again, if you're a musician, every line rings true and is funny. If not, well, ...how much more black can life then be?"
1,"I admit it, I just don't get this film","1. I'm into rock, classic rock and since this is one of those classic rock films--> I finally decided I needed to check this out.2. I admit that I'm lacking in... something, but I just don't get this film. It's kind of funny, but more so, it's just... dumb. But I'm willing to acknowledge to the knowledge of the masses that perhaps there is something magical about this film, it just eludes me."
1,Check the Format B4 Buying,"Hello,Be sure to check the format of a DVD before buying. I spent $50 for a 2 disk DVD that will not work on my USA DVD player. The format is in PAL for European DVD players. Caveat emptor!"
2,Not really that funny...,I was excited to watch this movie but was a little dissapointed because I expected it to be extremely funny.There are at least two memorable scenes but thats it.Rent this movie first.Waiting for Guffman is a lot funnier (though not from the exact same people behind Spinal Tap) though heartbreaking.
1,Getting an actual spinal tap would probably be better.,"Getting an actual spinal tap would probably be better than sitting through this mockumentary about the decline in popularity of the british rock group Spinal Tap. The one star is for the only funny part in this movie(cucumber). The parts that aren't funny are not just boring, but they are unbearable to watch. Concert after concert, the redundant songs that are dull and annoying. I am truly sorry I had to watch this movie and I'm writing this so you can save your money and time. If you want to see a good mockumentary check out And god Spoke, a classic."
1,not funny,"My best friend recommended this to me as the funniest movie ever. He said It would make me laugh. We ususally have the same sense of morbid humor, however I did not laugh once, I thought it was the dumbest movie I had seen in awhile. very dry humor, jay leno / carson jokes, not even close to funny or entertaining. My comedy recommendations: Friday, next friday, me myself and irene, scary movie...trying to think...anyway, you get the point, you were warned!"
1,THIS MOVIE ISN'T FUNNY!!!!!! DON'T BUY IT!!,"THIS MOVIE ISN'T FUNNY!! DON'T BUY IT! I watched it the whole time waiting for it to be funny, the only funny part was something about crackers being shaped wrong it's NOT funny!!!!Don't waste your money!!!i warned you!!"
1,Sitting By The Fireplace,"That little dog that chases the covered wagon underneath the sink? That was mine. In 1966, I went down to...This movie was probably thought of and concieved under that sink. This is pathetic! I would rather floss my teeth with Roseanne Arnold's gstring than be forced to sit through this lame piece of boring crap. Those of you who actually laugh at this stuff are in serious need of a qualified team of dedicated and trained deprogrammers. NOT ONE really funny line through the whole thing and the music isn't good enough for AM radio in any era. Instead of buying in this DVD rent it first. If you really do like it try snorting about a half can of Ronson lighter fluid and go sit by the fireplace."
4,Not quite an 11,"I first saw Spinal Tap when it came out years ago...then not again until a week ago. It was as funny as the first time. I have since seen about every Christopher Guest film or mockumentary and loved them.I think this film has a following and I think it would be fun to have a""where are the now? Spinal Tap, England's loudest band"" sequel.Is it award caliber, no. Is it entertaining and funny? Yes."
5,Demi Gods of Rock,My girlfriend is only 32 so she had never seen the movie. It was easier to buy then rent. So we turned it up to 11 and had a rocking good night!
4,No English subtitles!,"The movie itself deserves five stars and the special features are just gravy, but I want to understand EVERY WORD, and when everybody's mumbling at the same time I need help!"
5,Spinal Tap - A work of Art!,"This is an absolutely hilarious movie. This is a documentary on a british band called Spinal Tap. This band has never been very big in America, and they are not very bright, either. Half the vidio is clips of their playing, and the other half is interviews of the band. What makes this so funny is that this band is very unfortunate. Not only are they a little slow, but their drummers keep dying (one of a tragic gardening accident, another spontaniously combusts). They also run into a series of problems, like losing their way back stage and not able to find the stage. I highly recommend this to any garage band. It is also a large spoof on bands such as the Beastles and Led Zeppelin. Buy it!"
4,This DVD is a must buy,"The Criterion release of Spinal Tap on DVD is worth the extra few bucks. The 16mm film looks MUCH better than it should in this transfer, and the soundtrack gets a new Dolby surround mix (but no 5.1). The disc is PACKED with extras, including over an hour of deleted scenes (VERY entertaining), the original 20 minute demo film they used to sell the picture, and tons of trailers (which are as good as the film), production notes and pictures, and TWO commentary tracks (one by the filmmakers, the other by the 'band').BUY IT!"
5,One of the best comedies of all time,"The first film of Rob Reiner is one the best comedies of all time. It's a false musical documental. The actors are amazing, the artistic direction is great, and the songs are very funny & greats too.Is one the best ideas for make a splendit film. It recomends for all the people love the rock music & the ironic comedies for these music world."
4,Tap cranks it to 12,"The Tap is at it again. Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Christopher Guest star in this Rob Reiner masterpiece. There are so many jokes in this film like In Cleveland, Ohio, Spinal Tap gets lost in the basement under the stage. I recomend this comedy smash to friends. So crank it to 11 and watch the film with the extra bonus footage."
5,Smell the Glove... over and over again.,"After you have watched all of the other pansy movies, and decide, ""you've seen enough of that one"", watch the legandary Spinal Tap. If this movie dosn't part your hair, you should see it again. I highly recommend this film to anybody who is looking for a really funny and clever film"
3,Intravenous de Milo,"I've finally seen this for the first time in 2008, and I'm 44 years old, making me a contemporary of Harry Shearer or something. Wow, talk about being behind the times.There was no way this movie could live up to the hype. No way any movie could live up to what I heard about this when it was new. And a coworker gave away the best gag in the airport, which I'm not doing because I'm not such a spud.Anyway, I smiled a lot and chuckled a time or two. I enjoyed the music, too, which was unexpected, really. But mainly, I came away from this wishing that Spinal Tap was a real band, and that's a nice trick, don't you think?In short, this isn't ""laugh out loud funny"" as I was told over and over (and over) again, but it's certainly worth watching."
5,Where is it?,WHY OH WHY is this currently not available? My VHS copy is worn out from protracted viewing and I was looking forward to having a sparkly new DVD of this funniest of mockumentaries. Things don't get none more black than this...
4,"Yeah, This is Spinal Tap!","Hesitate no further, this is a must-have DVD! You get all the info you could want about the Loudest Band, including loads of outtakes you wish could have made the movie. I deduct one star because they didn't include the commentary with the director and actors from the Criterion DVD, which is no longer in print, and very hard to get for the new fan who didn't have the foresight to buy it when it was available. This is one of the funniest movies ever made, with satisfying extras, and needs to be in your collection!"
5,You can't really dust for vomit,"Any Tap-heads out there need no introduction to this bona fide classic. Simply buy the Special Edition DVD today and cherish it for life. Tons of extra goodies make it the definitive home video version. I'd also strongly recommend a killer new VHS release called ""Welcome to the Rainbow"". It's a hilarious rockumentary featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy of Motorhead, Ron Jeremy and other rock 'n roll lifers. Almost as funny as Tap -- and it's all true!"
5,two fer one,"So many many DVD's come out with a ""b"" side hook full of outakes and dopy commentary offered by a bored actor or director who you can visualize constantly looking at their watch while jabbering away. Not Spinal Tap. THere is, quite literally a whole other movie on side two. Another hour plus of outakes, floor clippings and the like, all pieced together as a kind of Spinal Tap II.. Every bit as good as the original. Seriously, what a deal!. This DVD is a great gift for anyone who's a musician or in the biz. Rob Reiner clearly built this flick for that audience. Lots of insider bits. This movie hits on all cylinders when it comes to actor talent. Perfect picks for the parts."
4,Dumb but Funny,"This movie is dumb, and contains a lot of stuff no one cares about. But is hilarius! I laughed my head off! Even though I'm sure this movie is totally made up, its almost as funny as Waynes World. Almost."
5,one of the best movies my wife has ever seen,"If you would enjoy laughing at yourself, and you had any part of the rock evolutions of the late 60s to early 70s, this movie has lots of moments for you. so says my wife. I must admit, I have met several closet tap-heads, and we have enjoyed a chuckle or two, or eleven."
3,NOT A BAD MOVIE JUST NEEDED MORE LAUGHS IN IT!!!!,"This is Spinal Tap is a good comedy movie to watch for only one time.... Some of the reviews that i just got done reading gave it five stars,but i think in my opinion i think to me that the movie deserves only three stars i was hoping to get more laughs out of it... It's worth renting but on buying it i wouldn't watch this movie again and again.... But do check this one out for one time!!!!!!"
2,A snooze,"This movie was a snooze fest. There were a lot of things that were obviously supposed to be funny, but the ""humor"", for the most part, just does not work. Obviously a lot of people disagree with me, but I did not find this movie to be entertaining at all."
4,FUNNY...,I SAW THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS FUNNY BUT SOME OF THE STUFF IN IT IS KIND OF RETARTED. LIKE HAVING AN 18 INCH LONG MONUMENT WITH TWO MIGITS RUNNING AROUND IT.THOUGH THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY FUNNY BUT NOT AS FUNNY AS I HAD PLANNED IT WOULD BE. STILL THIS MOVIE GAVE SPINAL TAP A HUGE COME BACK. AND REMEMBER LISTEN TO WHAT THE FLOWER PEOPLE SAY.
3,Don't watch!,"Blah. Dumb movie.Weird crotch shots,big eighties hair,strange lyrics and music,did not understand at all!don't, stay away!"
1,Trash.,An uninspiring account of victimhood. The author blames his mommy for a miserable and contemptible life which any sane person would be too shamed to reveal.
5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, the author really brought me into the experiences of both himself and each of the family he talked about. I found the book so so sad but told with great humour, frankness and the honesty in the book was both shocking and disturbing while refreshing and endearing. It is hilarious about the saddest things, real black humour very 'irish'! . Now I want Amanda's story! The author of this book tells it as real as it gets"
4,"Very sharp looking, just one drawback.","The batteries they put in these are wimpy little 600 mAh rechargables. They only lasted a few hours after dark. I replaced them with some 2250 mAh and there's a big difference.Brighter, stronger, longer!"
3,Short but cheap.,"Most of the other versions run 95 minutes or more but this one only runs 75 minutes. I suspect it is a shortened version, but the price is very attractive."
3,It is a 1919 film...,"I bought this movie to review in order to use it as an example of Asian stereotypes in a graduate paper and it didn't disappoint. The evidence of stereotypes and a down right racist point of view of course is not very surprising since the filmmaker is D.W. Griffith, (Birth of a Nation fame) or as I like to call Mr. Griffith, Mr. Ku Klux Klan. It is a simple film with a simple plot line with a 1919 mind set. Some of the 1919 themes present in the film are: 1. Drinking alcohol is bad because it turns people into abusive monsters. 2. Adolescent white girls are extremely vulnerable to men offering attention. 3. Most important of all, don't treat your white children badly because otherwise they'll end up roaming around less fortunate parts of town and fraternizing and liking company of people from other races. In essence, it is interesting to watch from a historical standpoint in filmmaking, but as far as watching a good movie for enjoyment this would not be the pick."
1,Simplistic and dated,"A tender though simplistic effort by D. W. Griffith. Very dated, especially in regards to the oriental stereotypes; the main character is only referred to as the yellow man. This is ironic since Griffith's reason for making this film was to respond to claims that he was racist based on his earlier film The Birth of a Nation."
2,Lillian Gish - the Duse of the Silent Film,"D.W. Griffith once characterized Hollywood, with perfectly unintentional irony, as ""a Detroit of the mind."" Griffith's mind was itself a mini-Detroit, a depressed megalopolis masquerading itself as a genuine human community. And Hollywood, that perpetual dreamworld with some distant connection with the geography of Southern California, was surely Griffith's creation. Yet another reason (as if we needed another!) to consign Griffith to one of the deeper circles of Hell. And yet (and yet!), Lillian Gish makes the film nearly bearable. She is easily America's First Lady of Film."
2,not what I hoped for,"This movie was probably a good one in it's time, but it was a very slow movie. The only good thing was the old cars. Not very many speaking parts. From all of the reviews I read I thought it was going to be a lot better, but like I said it probably was good in it's time. If you like old cars (mustangs) you should get it, or maybe rent it first."
3,Bullet BluRay DVD,"The movie was delivered quick and easy to my home! The movie was a bit slow, but the car chase senes was worth it!"
2,The car chase was good for its time.,"Steve McQueen portrays Bullitt, a stiff-nosed cop who is assigned to protect a gangster. It was a good movie, but the performances were stale. However, the plot remains fresh. Entertaining shoot-em-up...detective style!"
3,Bullitt DVD,"The DVD is in good condition for a release from the 1990's. I like the case it came in and there are no scratches on the disc. Came in the mail in 3-5 days, I can't remember."
2,LIKE GETTING SHOT BY A BULLITT,"Bullitt was one of the most overrated films I have seen in a very long time. As always Steve McQueen was cool in the movie but didn't show that much emotion to hold the viewers interest. The story itself was hard to follow, not because of a complex story but because they space the movie out with things that don't need to even be in the film like Bullitt picking up frozen food at the supermarket, going to the cafe, etc.These are the kind of scenes that are suppose to build up the character but in this case it doesn't. It was totally pointless. The basis of the story is very simple. So simple it could have been told in 30 minutes if you didn't include the pointless scenes I just described. I admit the car chase sequence was pretty cool, a lot better than the 'French Connection' one. All in all the chances you will get bored are extreamly high.If you are looking for your tough cop/car chase movie than hire out 'Dirty Harry' or 'the Italian Job'(original & re-make)"
2,Overrated,"I know this is considered a classic, but I personally did not like it. I thought it moved very slowly due to the minimal amount of action. Now, I love Steve McQueen just as much as the next guy, but I really do not think he played the hard-boiled, renegade cop all that well. His face didn't show any feelings of anger, frustration or rebelliousness. This film is famous for its car chase; I am sure that it was amazing for its time, but in this day and age, it is passe. The other thing that really bothered me about this film was its silence; there wa almost no soundtrack. Save for the occasional dialogue, song or sound effect, this felt like a silent film. The soundtrack elements that were present did not seem to enhance the story at all.If you want to watch a movie about a hard boiled, renegade cop, I highly recommend any of the Dirty Harry series over this one."
5,Classic Steve,McQueen really enjoyed making this movie and it showed.I have friends that knew him and he lived for excitementand challenge. His confidence in his driving abilitiescan not be more quable. Miss You!
4,Not a bad movie...,"This isn't a bad movie, kind of slow in parts, but makes up for that with the awesome car chases through the streets of San Francisco. If you like muscle cars, watch this one."
3,dated,Dated but still likeable San Francisco venue film for viewers who can't get enough of McQueen.
3,It Is Just Not That Good Anymore,"I am no spring chicken at 61 so I love and fondly remember the 60's but some movies just don't hold up. This is one of them. Movies now are faster, more exciting. This movie plods along and at near 2 hours is just plain boring now. Sure the car chase is still great, one of the best ever, but that does not justify sitting for 2 hours while this movie crawls along. It is now a mediocre movie at best. I might add, I absolutely admired and wanted so much to be like Steve McQueen. He is the ultimate cool guy but this movie is just not as exciting as it might have once been considered."
1,bullitt in Blu-ray,"Movie is in 1080p, Audio is in Stereo 2S, NOT IN 5:1 So don't be misled 5:1 audio is in the Commentary only."
3,I don't get why people like this movie so muchI,"I like Steve McQueen a lot so it's hard for me to rate a movie he's in anything less than 5 stars, but this movie isn't good at all. The only thing good about it was the car chase scene. Other than that, I didn't like it at all. McQueen is a great actor but I felt his acting in this movie wasn't very good, aside from the bad script, bad plot, and other bad acting."
5,A RIDE OF YOUR LIFE,Buckle up; hold on tight for the ride of your life. One of McQueen's best. A must see and you'll likely watch it many more times. A classic that will last for a very long time.
1,Great movie but,The quality of the sound recording is worst. The sound level fluctuates constantly. Either it is so low you cant hear what they are saying or it is so high it rattles the windows. Buy it somewhere else.
4,"Great movie, but HD-DVD adds nothing vs. DVD","This is a great film for Steve McQueen fans and if, like me, you did not already have a DVD of Bullitt and have an HD-DVD player, you might as well get this disk on Amazon's two-for-one offer since it's only $10, then. However, otherwise just get the DVD version as there is nothing the HD-DVD adds. This is an old movie and short of a Ted Turner style make-over, there is nothing that can be done to make it look better than the DVD version already does. The movie, in HD-DVD, is quite grainy and not sharp...just like on DVD.I rate it a five star for the movie and three star for the HD-DVD format and average to four starts."
5,The Need for Speed!,"Best Car Chase scene ever filmed. And just think, Steve does all his own stunts (...Driving!)."
5,One of the best movies ever made.,"COOL, CASUAL AND CONVICING. McQueen joins the ranks of top movie detectives.Fast, well acted. It has energy, drive, impact , and above all .....STYLE.Steve McQueen is perfect..... the very personification of COOL."
3,GREEN MUSTANG & PINK PORSCHE,"BULLITT is clearly an american film noir of the sixties. Members of the Organisation wear black hats, politicians are rotten and cops have the blues. Furthermore, the music of Lalo Shiffrin brings a cool jazzy atmosphere to the ensemble.The scene which will stay in my memory isn't the long car chase in the streets of San Francisco but the face of Steve McQueen sitting in the passenger's seat of Jacqueline Bisset's pink Porsche. It's worth multiple viewings.Warner did a pretty good jod with the DVD transfer, as for DIRTY HARRY, and bonus features are more than allright.A 1968 DVD."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"Great movie. Was expecting a widescreen print of blu ray.It was reduced to small screen, which cut out the full movie.A waste of money. I watch the regular dvd wide screen version."
5,Still one of the very best films ever.,Don't worry about the thin plot ( and possible plot holes) in this one.Sit back and enjoy McQueen at the peak of his game.The car chase that set the standard for action movies.
1,HORRIBLE,"This is definately one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I bought the title because of the ravings about the car chase and forced myself through the rest of the film. Since everyone else rated this movie so well, you might think I'm an idiot for my opinion. If you haven't seen the movie, give it a try and you decide. Oh, and Bullitt and his 68 Mustang are NOT CHASING A GTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S A CHARGER!!!!!!!!!!!Thank you very much for your time and consideration!"
4,Steve McQueen was never cooler,"As a cop doing things ""his way"" he pre-dates Clint andHarry Callaghan. Clint may have some good zinging oneliners, but McQueen is the eptiome of cool.In the famous ( and still the best ) car chase, he hardlyseems concerned. His scenes with Robert Vaughn as the oilyDA are great.There is no one comparable to McQueen even on the movie radarscreen right now. Not even on the edge."
3,The sweater,"In the last scene, Bullitt arives home, wearing his famous royal blue turtle-neck sweater.He goes into the bathroom and looking back at him is his reflection wearing a dark maroon turtle-neck sweater!and this movie won an award for editing!!The chase scene in San Francisco is still a classic!!!"
5,No Stunt Man For Steve!,"Steve McQueen was usually worth watching no matter what he was in, and he's excellent here as an intense but low-key cop. It's a pretty solid police thriller which features a famous car-chase scene that set the standard in its day.What's interesting to note, according to a documentary on the DVD, is that McQueen did his own driving! No stuntman for him, even at 110 miles per hour through the streets even the up-and-downf streets of San Francisco.Robert Vaughn, Don Gordon, Jacqueline Bissett, Simon Oakland and Robert Duvall complete the big-name cast, but this is McQueen's movie all the way.....and, for a film about 40 years old, it's not very dated."
3,classic,"Long drawn out plot, poor editing on car chase (see green beetle), did not age well. Regardless, this is a must see classic."
5,The car chase,"If you judge this movie with today's standarts you would say that it has a slow pace. However there are not many, if any, actors today like Steve McQueen just for that and the greatest car chase in movie history this movie is worth own it and watching it. It should be noted that at that period of time there were no computers or special effects that exist in todays movie industry and thus the car chase becames ever better. Good plot and great acting"
4,You don't have to bite the BULLIT to see this picture.,"This is definately one of Steve Mcqueen's best films. McQueen play a dective assigned to protect a star witness who will be testifying about the criminal organiztion he once belonged to. So as not to spoil anything I will suffice it to say that the plot becomes action packed very quickly and includes what is probably best car chase that will ever be put on film, and made the 60's Mustang an icon in muscle car history. Long story short Steve Mcqueen is an amazing actor, and this is an amazing film"
4,bullitt,"The movie was pretty slow paced at first, kinda like a puzzle waiting to be put together, but once you gather clues the movie really starts to come together, & it gets even better every minute, but you gotta see it without a blink of an eye, if you miss something the movie will suck.My favorite part of the movie was the car chase, which is without a doubt the best car thriller Ive ever experienced, a fast paced scene that I truly enjoyed.the colors & sound were good & I would have expected more car chases but overall the movie was a four star hit this movie is pretty good, check it out!!!"
4,McQueen at his driving best.,"I bought this disk mainly for the car chase because it is one of the best chases I have ever seen in a movie. I believe that McQueen did all his own driving in the picture. If you like wild car chases, this is the movie to see again and again. I actually felt my stomach doing flip flops while I watched him chase the bad guys."
3,Bullitt- Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,"For along time I heard that this movie was the definitive cool car chase/action movie. But when I saw it, I was gravely disappointed. The one big car chase was great, but that was about it. There were a lot of slow boring scenes. I'm not some bratty SoCal kid with an attention span of .00000001 seconds, but this was a real letdown. It got the 3 star by the skin of it's teeth. You want good 70's cop entertainment? Watch Dirty Harry movies, at least he's always involved in gritty, urban adventures with no waiting around."
2,Seen better movies...,"Car chase is not so good as told ... or maybe it was in 1968. Not worth of buying just because of the chase. But anyway - McQueen, cars and musics were pretty cool anyway..."
1,It's about as exiting as watching Mr. Rogers.,"Steve McQueen in my opinion has made lotsa dull films (not The Great Escape and The Magnificent Seven.) Most of the film he looks at dead people at the morgue, and little else. He barely pays attention to his case. This movie is too [...] detailed. I remember them showing him in the grossery store 16 times. The film slowly got tiresomely slow. I was squirming in my seat 37 minutes before the car chase. When it came, all I heard was roaring motors. It was so damn pointless that after the car chase I decided to fast foward to the airport shootout. Big mistake! It was just as slow-paced as the car chase, only worse. The film is just too terrible for me to talk of anymore. I recommend it to [...] fans of dated films. Peace out!"
1,Bullitt = Bad,"Not to offend anyone who liked this film, but I simply couldn't find anything inherently good about it. Except for the car chase, but then again, couldn't the two villains have had some sort of dialog! For the entire car chase the two don't utter a word! Unbelievable.Bad script and wooden acting = bad movie.The movie came out in '68, one year after I was born and I had always heard great things about the chase scene, but to me this alone doesn't warrant purchasing this film. Sorry.Should have bought the SD-DVD! I should add that the transfer was pretty good."
2,Great Movie. Bad Blu ray,"The sound quality was not good,the volume went up and down and it was very difficult to watch an excellent movie.I would not recommend this blu ray to anyone, I would have them look somewhere else for a better quality blu ray."
3,very dated and has a weird ending,"Interesting only because it had one of the first bad ass car chase, but other than that very dated. I didn't see much I would consider good acting. The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I have both the standard DVD and now (unfortunately) have the Blu-ray DVD. I was very disappointed in the extremely grainy picture quality on this disc. After watching the movie on Blu-ray I inserted the standard DVD and compared a few scenes. The main difference I can see on the Blu-ray copy is that some scenes appeared brighter. Even on sale for $9.99 this was a waste of money.Since initially writing this review I have decided there is one benefit to the poor quality of this blu-ray release. It will actually save me money because I now have no desire to replace any movie in my existing collection of standard DVD's with its blu-ray counterpart. Probably not the result Warner Home Video was looking for, but what they should have expected."
1,This review is for the blu-ray quality (or lack of blu-ray quality),"This review is to address the blu-ray quality of this movie.It is awful. Grainy, flat, milky. If you want this movie, buy it on DVD, not on blu-ray. Paying extra for blu-ray is a waste of money in this case.As everyone knows, old movies just don't transfer well to blu-ray....but this one transferred worse than most."
2,"Cropped, and dark (blu ray)","The image is cropped, especially on the top and sides. I don't like seeing the tops of heads cut off in every other scene. It's grotesque.The dark areas are too dark. Much detail is gone.I'm new to blu ray. I thought they were supposed to look better, not worse, than DVDs."
5,Great Gift!,"My Dad has forever talked about the chase scene in Bullitt. Finally, this Christmas we got it for him and he enjoyed it as much as he did watching it the first time."
5,Awsome movie - must own,"This is a must own movie for any collection small or large. The chase sceene is the one that set the bar every movie after this one. I now have a copy on DVD, Blue-Ray and Ihave downloaded a copy to my Kendle Fire."
4,The Classic 70's Cop Movie (from 1968!),"This was one of a handful of truly classic cop movies from the period. Not to be missed if only for one of the best chase scenes ever to make it to film. Steve McQueen is more Steve McQueen than usual; calm, cool and always in charge. If you liked the Dirty Harry series, the French Connection or the Seven Ups this is a must see. This version is also in Wide Screen (unlike the one I rented) and it's much better than the cut up for your TV version."
4,McQueen Cool,"Just saw this in the last month, and it has held up pretty good over the years. The chase scene through San Francisco is still the template for all to follow. Closest to this was Gene Hackman's elevated train (el) chase in the ""French Connection"". ""Bullitt"" is not as slow-paced as ""Connection"" before the big event, though. Worth the moolah."
3,it was OK,"the DVDs that arrived had writing on it and i was unable to give it as a gift. , but it played just fine."
5,best car chase ever!,"Sure the story was great - but the car chase made it immortal. In fact, watch this film and follow it with a viewing of the Michael Mann film HEAT. You'll be shocked at how ahead of its time this is - and how HEAT ripped off its plot."
4,Bullitt,"This movie was a first for the director in the USA, No part of the movie was shot in studio. The mustang stunts were done by Steve McQueen. The Mustang had a 351 C engine, the car was one of 4 built for the movie."
4,A classic,"A classic of its kind from the 1960s.The picture quality suffers from too much soft focus, but audio is good.In the extras division, there is commentary by Peter Yates, as well as a good featurette from the time of filming that shows the making of the car chase (SD). Also in SD is the special bio feature Steve McQueen: The Essence of Cool.My favorite, though, is a new documentary in high definition on Movie Editing, featuring a look at a lot of film clips (and because they are in 1080p in this documentary, we can get a look at how they will look on Blu-ray). The documentary runs about 90 minutes.On the whole, I think this is worth definitely renting but not so sure I would recommend it for a purchase because of the PQ."
3,Good enough but it leaves a 'what was that' taste in your mouth...this is a very forgettable film,"Steve was a big actor in the 1960's and 70's but the films i've seen him in remind me of a looong sequel. I got nothing from this film and it somehow never made any sense.If you are a McQueen fan sure go ahead and get it..if you are not a fan of his, watching this film wont change that fact."
1,bad!!!,"this must be a classic from the classic!! don't make me laugh!! the story is boring, it was a terrible movie!!!!"
5,EAST-WEST CRIME GAME,"For people with absolutely nothing to do,rate the famous chase scene in this legendary hit with the one 3000 miles away several years later in ""The French Connection"". Both Frank and Popeye are ""loose canon""cops, supported by highly liberal bosses.Also, in both instances, the police quickly reverse roles,faster than a Clark Kent undressing,becoming the reckless persuers, wanting desperately to atone for past blunders. The spectacular cinematography in San Francinco is contrasted to the stark realism of Brooklyn, but our heroes get their men, albeit in very different ways. Be forwarned to get your vote in quickly, lest Matt Damon attract all non AARP voters in ""The Bourne Ultimatum""."
1,"Description is false ""Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy ""","Product description reads "" Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy "" but is only a single disc. (DVD) Buyer beware if it seems to good to be true it is. Correct description and be honest about your product."
5,Possibly McQueen's best. Picture quality only okay.,"This film is probably my favorite of McQueen's. He was the essence of Hollywood cool when he was still around. However, for a Blu-Ray I wasn't that impressed. The picture quality still seems slightly grainy, but for a film made in 1968 I think the Blu-Ray people did as good a job as they could on a film that's 40+ years old. Saw this on the big screen when it first came out. That I will never forget."
3,A classic old thriller,"This is considered a classic thriller. I watched this movie when I was a kid and I loved it.Watching it again some 30 years later, I found it very slow and the car chase is just a minor plus in this movie. I watched all this movie simply because it is a classic however the story including the sound effects and picture of the DVD are simply very basic and not worth spending the money. Rent it first, and see if it is worth buying."
3,WIT PROTECTION (SURE),"DVD adds little (in this case nOthing), to the viewing and story. Smart-aleck cop McQueen tries in vain to protect wit that others are trying in vain to waste. Legendary highlight is car chase. I had no idea it was so good! My stomach fell right thru the sofa as they started up and down those damn hills. Sideways around corners. I thought they would both explode. I really don't know the difference between a Mustang and a Challeger. But my brother does because he watches nascars all the time and he thinks this is the best race ever. But I know its staged. Bumpy though. Fasten your seat=belts!"
3,It was better in the 60's,Funny how you missed the repeating of the same scenes over and over to make up the car chase when you are a teenager. Good for a few memories and laughs.
4,A hip Mcqueen in the coolest 60s location. Dream matchup,I would be tempted to give a five star rating to this fast moving 60s offering but not for the acting alone. The location is probably what sets this film apart from the ordinary coupled with Mcqueen at his coolest and at the top of his all to short career. There are not many films set in this city that have ended up lemons. It would be a pity if all this movie was remembered for was the sight of Mcqueen propelling a 67 GT Mustang around the streets of San Fransisco as there is much to like both in the story line generally and the adequate and sometimes brilliant casting.Don Gordon gives a standout performance as does Robert Vaughn who seldom failed to give of his undoubted best certainly during the 60s. A very watchable film for many reasons.
4,It's Bullitt... How can you not like it! :-D,"I disagree with one of the other posters. I hadn't seen this movie in along time. When I first saw it, I had to sneak in to a theater with some friends to see it. Now I'm a young 'un, only 57. But, even though I discovered some of the chase scene trickery, I still think this is a good movie after all these years. This, of course, was pre-green screen goofy-ness... and that can only be a good thing, eh? :-D"
5,"BULLITT, a great movie of the 60's","Steve McQueen is really a good actor!... Great car chase with wonderful effects, with music to hear the cars sounds. A classic."
3,Good modifier but..,"Good, durable and quality light as with all rotalux and elinchrom modifiers. Sadly, the modifier that came with the box didn't have the carrier bag. I was expecting one, just the same as the midi-octa i bought from amazon. So disappointed"
4,A very good book from beginning to end!,This book is probably one of the best Star Trek Voyager books. I think that the story was well told and it has everything ayou want in a voyager book!
3,It was Pointless,"This book was dull, not to mention pointless. It left me with a sense that Janeway had done something wrong, by coming to the star system. It didn't have much scientific information about the Superweapon, and the Characters didn't interact. you got the feeling that no one really liked each other... On the whole I was bored. For slower readers this might be a good book, but fast readers probaly won't enjoy it. It doesn't leave you with a feeling of completness, like most Voyager books do."
3,not bad,"I enjoyed Tuvok going bonkers and Neelix outsmarting the guy with the replicator. but, don't read this if you're not a Voyager fan."
5,ADORABLE,"ADORABLE...and excellent quality! :)My only complaint is that the bottoms are quite small (particularly when you are putting them over a swim diaper). For that reason, I would order this product a size (or two) larger than needed..."
5,Tom's Ze world.,"great video, short in terms of music, just few tunes , but worth to listen too, as well as the interview which offers a valuable insight about Tom 's Ze life, upbringing,etc."
5,Pink Cream 69 one size fits all,I think this cd is definitely a classic. the music and vocals are excellent. If your looking for good rock-n-roll you will love this band and this cd.
2,Glad for the change,Glad the band changed singers and their sound. If you want to listen to some outstanding PC69 of the melodic nature start with Electrified and go forward. If you end up liking what you hear give David Readman's solo a go and his vocals on Voodoo Circle. You can thank me later.
3,It was ok,"This one didn't grab me like ""Don't Let Me Go"" or ""Pay it Forward"" did, but it was an interesting read."
3,Just as I remembered it,"I LOVE this movie! My only complaint is that the extra/special features (minus the cast and crew section) do not have sound...unless you pause the feature, start it again and then the sound is magically restored! Other than the quality of the extra features, I would generally give this movie 5 stars."
5,A wonderful and cheerfull film full of memory,I watched this film when I was a child and I have never imagined to see Mr Wonka again. This time DVD bring me the excellent vision and audio entertainment and also bring me the memory. I enjoy the film with the Madarin subtitle in the asia version as my English is not good. Now I am looking forward to taste Willy Wonka Chocholate Bar in Hong Kong.
5,Adventure filled story for all ages,"A great adventure filled story about a pour young boy that wins a ticket to a Willy Wonka candy factory and learns a lesson in life he will never forget. With his grandfather they both have the time of their lives.Only one person stands in their way, the grumpy Willy Wonka himself."
5,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"Easily another soon to be classic, Willy Wonka and the Choclate Factory is a delight for any admirers of the book and the entire family. On this 30th Anniversary DVD you get the great movie in almost new looking, vibrant colors and sound and also a few extras like a commentary by all 5 Golden Ticket winners, all grown up talking about the film.Adapated from the book, it starts out as Willy Wonka, the famed and mysterious candyman finally decides to open the gates to his chocolate factory, but only to 5 lucky people who find A Golden Ticket. Inside, his factory a world of wonder, sweets, pure imagination and more sweets await!I'd pick this up in a heart beat! This is a great family buy and every child should see this movie (if not read the book). If you're shopping around for more movies, check out WIZARD OF OZ as well. It's another great, classic family movie sing a long. You'll remember all those good times and you're kids will love it!"
5,"Great movie, a Classic!","I always wanted this movie, it is has a very nice story, my children loved it and I think it is much healthier for the minds of my children than the new version. My 8 year old son watch it several times only in one weekend and it is their favorite movie among all the ones they have."
4,Fascinating information about a classic treasure,"My 10-yr-old daughter and I watched this DVD recently, and she loved it. She'd seen it before, and had really wanted to see it again. Then we looked at the additional content - and that was what I wanted to especially write about.The additional content was very interesting, and really added to my appreciation. The fact that the producer's 10-yr-old daughter was the provocation for the movie getting made was delightful to my daughter. And who knew that the movie came into existence because of the long-forgotten candy bar, produced by Quaker Oats?I'd highly recommend this bit of our shared cultural history."
2,same as 1999 release,"I just purchased a copy of Willy Wonka and the chocolate on blu-ray i was disapointed because i also own the 1999 release on dvd and you get all the same extras nothing is different, the only difference is the hi-res. althought the 1999 release has very good picture quality, and a better menu. the blu-ray menus could have been much better. also you get a booklet with the blu-ray copy which is no big deal. i give the movie 5 stars but i give the blu-ray 2."
2,HD-DVD Issue,"I bought the HDDVD version and also had issues with the disc. Unlike the other HDDVD review I read who's disc froze in the special features, my disc froze in the main movie, right as they enter the factory. This is about the worst timing, Im already into the movie, loving the HD picture, and then nothing further right when it gets to the most visually stunning part. I was bummed, still am. At least I bought it post HDDVD demise, so it only cost a couple dollars. I put the HDDVD in the drive within 15 seconds of removing the shrinkwrap, so it is not fingerprints or anything on my part. I use the xbox360 HD Drive with a 360."
5,One of our favorites,"A perfect family movie. Great songs, great story. Incredible colors and sets. Gene Wilder's best performance. Buy this one for your family (present and future.)"
1,Disappointed!!,"Unfortunately I received the most pruduto spensive and unnecessary. The seller sent via express dhl, no need. I was taxed on a product below $ 50.00 and the most possible service charges of Brazilian custom house. A good seller, a seller with experienced international sales would know about it and send the product otherwise. The final product was three times higher than it should be. Disappointed!!"
5,Quick and easy !!,"The order for this product was very quick and easy. I received my dvd soon after in perfect condition and as specified. A trusted seller from who I would definitely order again. Thanks! As for the movie, absolutely fantastic !!! A great classic with music that sticks in your head and makes you feel like a kid again !!! Fun for all !!!"

THIS MOVIE IS THE ONE YOU WANT TO KEEP IN YOU COLLECTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TO BE HONEST, WHEN I WATCH THIS MOVIE IT MAKES ME WANT TO EAT CHOCOLATE ALL THE TIME!!!ENJOY THE MOVIE!!! :"
4,not quite what i thought,nothing against the seller but i thought the picture quality was poor. it looks no better than an up converted dvd.
5,"For the right price, a must own :)","Being a child of the 80s, we all remember this one! If you can find it for ~$25 here on Amazon, go for it. Lots of extra goodies...and mine came still in it's shipping cardboard from the manufacturer. Also, surprised to see they are individually numbered..limited edition of 100,000. I'm not sure how ""limited"" that is..but still..it was a nice touch :)"
1,The widescreen version is pan & scanned from the fullscreen!,"This DVD is an outrage! I had previously purchased the fullscreen version of this movie and liked it so much that I wanted to see what I was ""missing"" and decided to get the widescreen version. After reviewing each movie side by side on 2 DVD players, I found the widescreen version is nothing more that the fullscreen version clipped off at the top and bottom. An outrage! The result is lower quality resolution and missing images. One would be wiser to purchase the fullscreen version and zoom it in to pretend it is widescreen yourself."
4,I love it,"I love it this picture, because our childrens can learn the attitudes of others and their consequences. Is excellent. Thanks."
4,Forgot how much I loved this movie,This version is way better then the Johny Dep one. The picture quality is realy good. I realy didn't need all the etra stuff but it was cheaper then just the blue ray.
4,Ever Lasting Candy,Another one of my daughter's favorite movies. Just a world of imingation that takes you a way to a very colorful place. A great movie for youngsters about telling the truth
1,Lousy Quality,"I did the 48 hour rental for my grandkids. While the movie is wonderful, the quality of the streaming was TERRIBLE! (It was NOT my TV either). Some sections were barely discernible."
5,my favorite ki's movie,"I've been watching this movie since I was about 5 years old. I'm only 16 now. but I still love it just as much if not more. I bought this dvd last year. and I think it's great. I really like the ""pure imagination"" documentary extra. Everything about this movie is perfect. so i'd advise everyone to get this. it will be countless hours or maybe even years of entertainment for the whole family."
4,"Timeless, Even if You Don't Like Candy","I loved this film as a kid from the very first time I saw it in a theater, and that love has not diminished one bit in the 40-odd years since. This movie is an all-time classic.It's a beautiful fantasy tale of mystery and wonder, of wildest dreams coming true, of adventure, with the clear moral that honesty, truth and humility will always stand you in good stead. That, and imagination is only as real as you choose for it to be, whether an adult or a child. A beautiful, lyrical, magical film for adults and children alike. And it's fun to sing along with, too.My 3-year-old son loves this movie. He can't yet explain why, and it really doesn't matter. It's got candy, outrageous and colorful (literally) characters, fantastic sets, song and dance, and every now and then goes seriously surreal, strange, and downright creepy.Superior entertainment, with a valuable, positive, and stealthy character-developing message."
2,Golden ticket is an HD-DVD that plays!,"I went though SIX copies of this before getting one that played without issues. This is yet another title that suffered from Warner's shoddy disc manufacturing. If your copy plays, consider yourself lucky.Even with a playable disc however, you find another way Warner screwed up HD-DVDs- this, along with other titles including Enter The Dragon, The Fugitive and Lethal Weapon 2, looks like it was transferred through a screen door! Everything has a blocky look to it- if you've seen it, you'll know what I mean. (Amazingly, I've read some positive reviews of this HD-DVD when it first came out, proving that many people wouldn't know what a good picture looked like if it hit them in the face!)I don't know if the Blu-Ray, which came out a bit later, uses the same flawed transfer or not."
3,good movie,"This is the original willy wonka movie with gene wilder, maybe not one of his best movies and it is a bit weird in places, basicly the story is that wonka (wilder) is putting gold tickets in certain wonka chocolate bars kids from all over the world buy up tons of the bars in hopes of getting a gold ticket, if you find one you get to visit the wonka candy factory. Yes its a kids movie but i think adults will enjoy it as well, no swearing, sex or violence. jack albertson is the boys grand father who gos along with charlie (He finally got a gold ticket) on a wonderfull magical tour of the candy factory, and of course thats where they meet the oompa loompas. Roy kinnear is allso in it. Do i recomend it? yes i think this movie should be in your library."
5,Wife Loved Willy Wonka,"My wife is into older movies from her childhood like Never Ending Story, Goonies and of course Willy Wonka. So I got the blu-Ray for her on Mother Day's and she loved it and it looks great."
4,Review of Willy Wonka VHS,"I received the product quickly. The case was a bit beat up, but the VHS works great."
5,Loved it as a kid,Loved this movie as a kid and still love it know. It captivates the imagination and makes you dream of the impossible.
4,Great,Great movie and worked fine. A must buy though I don't like that Amazon is charging taxes now in CA
2,Irritating.,"This movie is about a third generation loser that defies odds to inherit a factory downtown and become a chocolatier. Charlie as he is called, is flanked by the opportunistic Gandpa Joe who has spent twenty years in bed before literally leaping at an opportunity to tour the factory of a local recluse candy manufacturer (Willy Wonka) with his grandson. Willy Wonka concocts as series of sadistic tests to weed through the list of invited children before finally choosing Charlie. In the end Charlie must choose his path but what what will it be?This film irritated me on many levels. The biggest irritation was how Charlies mother worked her fingers to the bone to support her mother, father, in-laws and bastard son all while Grandpa Joe laid in bed ill for twenty years. Suddenly when an opportunity comes his way he is back on his feet. The sheer laziness of that family is sickening. I could not watch this again."
1,Chocolate covered psychedelic dream,"I don't like this movie. It's dated, the 'mod' and 'psychedelic' effects clearly placing it in the late '60s/early '70s.Wonka is a corporate CEO for the new millenium, though. He closes his factory, throwing the town into ecomomic chaos. Then he brings in slave labor (the Oompa-loomps) to make his candy.The only song worth remembering is ""The Candy Man""."
4,Rating based on my daughter's opinion,"I never liked this movie as a child. I love Gene Wilder, but I just never liked it for some reason. My 9 year old daughter and her friend, however (and her friend's mother) love it. My daughter did not ask to watch it again (yet) but enjoyed it. Her friend and the friend's mom watch it repeatedly. Compared to the movie, Charlie and the Choc Factory with Johnny Depp, I don't know. I have heard great things about that. I ordered this on the ""view now"" for $2.99 which is an awesome capability. My daughter stayed in the comfort of her room while she was not feeling well and watched it on the laptop. Great price for filling a need."
3,My mom loves this movie!,I bought this as a present for my mom because she loves this movie. Very cute.
2,$45.00? Isn't that a wee bit overpriced?,"I've never been a big fan of this film, even without reading the Roald Dahl book it was based on. Just a little too lightweight and creaky for me. (not being blinded by nostalgia, I think the Tim Burton film is far superior). But no matter how much you like this film, charging $45.00 for it is simply ridiculous. (And the $65.00 list price is grotesque. I wouldn't pay that unless Gene Wilder delivered it personally) I suggest waiting until the price reaches a reasonable level."
1,DVD did not work!,My children wanted to see the original version of this move so I ordered it but we were all disappointed to find that this DVD did not work in any of my DVD players.
5,Great extras on the DVD,"I was disappointed that the studio didn't release this in wide screen, but I'm still happy to have it. I especially enjoyed the documentary extras and the commentary track by the 'children'. My kids still ask me, 'Please, can we watch Mr. Willy Wonka?'"
5,Amazing Classic Must Own!,Willy Wonka is a wonderful film for the whole family. Any age can and will enjoy this movie! It is WAAAAYYYYYY better than the remake with Johnny Depp. Gene Wilder is fantastic as the mysterious Willy Wonka. The casting director also couldn't have found a better Charlie!
5,Gifted away,Given for presant at christmas. no info on quality of CD. package was unopen in new condition. Good Quality .
3,Disapointed,"Let me start off my saying this is one of my all time favorite films of all time. I could not give it any more stars because of what it is, just the DVD but on blue ray. While the quality looks better that is all there is to it. There are really no extra features than on the DVD. The interviews were all done 15 years ago. And the voice over from the cast is the same that is on the DVD version that I own now I own two copies because this came with a DVD as well). If you can get this as a stand alone bluray than I would do that rather than waste money on this set."
5,"a beautifully colored, dark fairy tale","this is one of my favorite movies of all time - its the most amazingly endearing yet horrifically dark fantasy tales ever.something like two or three years ago i got my first dvd player and my first dvd was willy wonka. i was SO excited. but something was missing.... speacial features. i really wanted to know all about the making of and what the kids were really like and so on....then they re-released the movie this past year and i was even more excited; all the features i wanted were on it. i finally got it on x-mas and as soon as i had it i popped it in the dvd player... whoever decided to put commentary on the dvd with the kids was brilliant! they were so funny.... it was the most insightful, amusing, and all around worhtwhile special feature i've seen on a dvd.i only love the movie that much more now that i've seen the re-mastered and re-released edition.... thank you so much to the studio for doing this."
5,Absolutely Scrumptous,"I finally rented this movie after hearing about it for years. It was great! A true classic - not just for children, but for adults.Spoiled brats, greedy children, and overindulgent parents share the screen with Charlie, who is the star of this film, and Willy Wonka, the millionaire chocolate factory owner. Gene Wilder is hilarious in his role as the goofy and slightly deranged Wonka, who obviously has no idea how to interact with adults, nevertheless spoiled children. Each time a child disappears in his factory, Mr. Wonka simply moves on to the next attraction.Funny and sentimental, this film will have you singing along to the many songs. Now I know what the fuss was about. Enjoy!"
5,Awesome,This is a total classic and is so much fun to watch over and over again. I would buy it again
5,AHAHAHAHA,GREAT just great there is no way to ever top this movie. Gene Wilder is so amazing and just a pleasure to watch.
2,children must conform or suffer,"I thought I liked this but re-watching really was an ugly experience. Wonka is a fascist and treats his army of servants like dirt, he has complete disregard for the death and mutilation of the obnoxious kids (sure they're annoying, but is it just sort of okay that they die?). Charlie, who remains a total bootlick through all this, is rewarded with the dubious honor of Wonka sort of adopting him and playing continuious mind games with him. Clearly this is the work of a cynical group with an intense dislike and distrust of children."
2,Propaganda,"This movie is about a third generation loser that defies odds to inherit a factory downtown and become a chocolatier. Charlie as he is called, is flanked by the opportunistic Gandpa Joe who has spent twenty years in bed before literally leaping at an opportunity to tour the factory of a local recluse candy manufacturer (Willy Wonka) with his grandson. Willy Wonka concocts as series of sadistic tests to weed through the list of invited children before finally choosing Charlie. In the end Charlie must choose his path but what what will it be?"
4,"Loved it, loved it!","My four-year-old loves this movie. It demonstrates to children the sad fate of four 'naughty' little children and the wonderful reward bestowed on the kind, honest Charlie. Most-loved scene is definately the room where everything is edible! Creates bright, colourful dreams, great music and lyrics. A winner."
5,Oompa Loompa,"What can you say about the great Willy Wonka. If you are a fan of this movie and who isn't, you should own it just for the extras...Finally found my golden ticket!!!"
5,Snozzberries!,"In 1969, when I was ten years old and had a very bad flu, my sister plopped herself at the end of my bed and read me the entire book of Roald Dahl's Charlie and The Chocolate Factory in one fantastic sitting. It became my instant favorite. You can believe that two years later I was waiting in line at the theater the day the movie opened. I was thrilled, enchanted, triumphant--my favorite book had become my favorite movie!What can I tell you that you don't already know? That Willy Wonka is a subversive mastepiece? That it's an adult movie for kids? Or is it a children's movie for adults? Doesn't matter, like The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a must-see for every child and every parent."
1,don't buy,"i think the dvd was a pirated and that was the reason it was so cheap, it didn't work in any of my 4 dvd players. but amazon gave me my money back pretty quickly without asking questions."
2,Disappointing,"I just saw this movie for the first time the other night. I was so disappointed. The movie is about a candy factory owner who has 5 golden tickets inserted into 5 Wonka bars that are distributed around the world. The 5 people who find the golden tickets are given a tour of his factory. The movie does teach a lesson in morals & ethics. I can't really say much about that because it would give the ending away.I didn't particularly like this movie, but it was interesting to see."
1,Creepy and boring all at the same time,"I never was a fan of this movie neither was my brother. This movie is very boring and pointless. About two years ago my teacher read the book to us and then we watched this movie and I have to say, this has just about nothing to do with the book! Those geese should be squirrels and Wonka is nothing like Gene Wilder in the book. All the kids are portrayed as brats!!!!!Next, this movie is just plain creepy. The loompas are from horror movies not a child's classic. How is this even a classic???? It has no real great thing that's really going for it (maybe Gene Wilder) The tunnel is a nightmare. How did they think kids could handle that. Guess what, this film was a huge flop when it came out and then someone said it should be a classic. What happens to the kids is wrong. If you really want to see and good version get Tim Burton's version of the story so badly crushed by this trash."
5,christmas gift,"i was surfing amzon for gifts for christmas for my kids and a friend. i decided on this dvd. i got it on time and im very happy. i would recommend amzon, thank you so much."
5,A Classic,This movie is one of my all-time favorites. I rented it through Amazon on instant watch for a little girl I was nannying for this Summer. She enjoyed every bit of this movie. It was very simple to view online and easy to go back and pick up where we left off when we took a break. I highly recommend!
1,"I should send it back, but its to much if a hasel","Did not play extra martial, just showed a picture and had plenty of audio. I will end up spending the money to buy a good one later on."
1,Simply didn't work,"DVD arrived promptly as a gift for my grandkids, but nothing comes up at all when inserted into DVD player. Labels look a bit ""iffy"". i have reported problem to the seller and am hoping to hear that this was a fluke, but so far, no word."
4,One of My Favorite Movies,"I pre-ordered this DVD about 2 weeks before it was released, and I never pre-order stuff. I've always loved this movie. My only complaint is that it is full-screen instead of letterbox.When I ordered this DVD, I ran out and told all my friends that this great movie was being re-released... and I've had nothing but harassment ever since. ""What on earth is an almost 21 year old with no kids doing buying Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?"". Well, besides the fact that this movie is a classic, and I am a film nut, but this film also has appeal for adults. There are several elements that a 6 year old just would not understand. So if you haven't seen this film after the age of 16 or so, don't tell me that I'm a nutcase until you've watched it again."
5,"One of the truly great movies, good DVD","Outstanding, good-natured parable movie. Truly a classic. This DVD version has some decent extras as well, but the real reason to get this is to watch this movie whenever possible."
3,"One MILLION copyright warnings on Region-Free, Great movie quality","I'm not going to waste your time here. The movie quality is excellent and the price for this version is great compared to the other versions available on Amazon.The one thing that annoys the crap out of me is that before the movie plays, there is about ONE MILLION copyright warnings in like 20 different languages on the region-free version. Seriously. So. ANNOYING.Other than that it's a steal at this price :-)"
5,Excellent classic!,This one was excellent. Too bad they had to insult Gene Wilder and the others in that new version. Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka and no one else. This film had very memorable music that is still in my head despite the fact that I have not seen this movie in a few years. The Umpa Lumpas in this one were different people and not all the same like in that new release. Maybe the special effects are not as nice but everything else in this one was better.
4,Willy Wonka is my kids favorite tap,Willy Wonka is a great tape. It is one of my children's favorite tape. The clarity of the picture is good and we all wound up with popcorn and great moods. Its a must see for children (and some adults who are still young in heart). Its just one of many tapes that you can get from Amazon that provide great entertainment for the wholefamily.
3,I Didn't get my scented pencils,I thought this was an excellent addition to my collection however I did not receive the scented pencils that were supposed to come with the set.
5,Wonderful movie!,"This movie is absolutely amazing. The scenery is beautiful, the story is worthwhile and captivating, and the antics of Willy Wonka are very amusing. Though this movie version does not follow the book precisely, it still seems true to Roald Dahl's vision of how the story should be shown.The young actors in this movie are talented, and show a wonderful ability to portray the traits of their characters perfectly. Gene Wilder is perfect as Willy Wonka, able to show the wild emotions of the character in a way that is both accurate to the book's version of the character and that is hilarious.I would recommend this movie for both kids and adults, who will both find something special about it."
5,scrumdidlyumptious,"This is by far my favorite movie of all time. I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Ostrum 12 years ago, as he was the uncle of one of my friends. It was my favorite movie before that, but that encounter certainly cemented it. The extras with this DVD are awesome. I didn't realize the book was included, and I had already purchased ""Pure Imagination"" a couple years ago when it first came out. The pencils and eraser were fun additions. Any Wonka fanatic needs to add this to their collection!!"
2,Dimensions are WRONG!,"The case is fine, but it is nowhere near the 4x6x9 dimensions that are listed. It is more like 3.25"" wide, by 5.25"" tall, by 2.5"" deep. As a result, what I wanted to carry in it doesn't fit!"
3,Its a good backup case for my digital camera,This camera case is a little bulky. Its good but just that I have a Canon Sd400 and this one is meant to be used with a lot of cameras and hence is free size. Other than this everything is great.
3,New?,"The description of the product said it was new, however; the item did not come in its original packaging. I believe when a product is new it should be in its oem packaging. Item appeared to be in excellent condition. I guess you pay for what you get. Item was relatively cheap but i dont believe it was new despite its excellent condition."
3,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 37","Good parody ofThe Godfather Collection (The Godfather / The Godfather: Part II / The Godfather: Part III)kind of film. Huston adheres to the law of the genre by presenting one-dimensional characters like Don -Nosferatu- Corrado Prizzi, Charley -romantic- Partanna or Maerose -Lady Macbeth-Prizzi for instance but, by introducing in this frozen family Irene Walker's character, whom nobody manages to completely understand because Irene never does what she's expected to do, John Huston goes beyond the bounds of the parodic genre. Recommended."
2,Inferior dub of a flawed crime film,"This ABC Motion Pictures VHS of PRIZZI'S HONOR is recorded in SLP mode and doesn't have HiFi audio.The tape I recently purchased tracks well enough but as is to be expected, the picture quality is less-than-ideal: a bit of fuzziness and color over-saturation is obvious throughout.As for this John Huston work which is billed as a comedy, it's not all that funny and except for a dramatic switchblade climax, rather slow-moving. Jack Nicholson's Brooklyn mobster accent is all wrong. He sounds like a generic dummy and clearly the character Jack plays is no fool. William Hickey as the family's doddering Don is also miscast. Best here is Anjelica Huston in a vengeful spurned lover role.There's better mob-type movies and to be certain far superior home video versions of this one. (If not for the SLP issue, it would be rated 3-stars.)"
3,Its Alright,"'Prizzi's Honor' is a mediocre gangster/love story set, of coarse, in New York City. Jack Nicholson plays a hitman who falls in love with a seemingly innocent woman. Later he finds out the woman is part of a complicated hiest and has command of a large sum of money. Directed by the legendary John Houston, this film seems odd and off balance at times, but never is bad. Nicholson and Angelica Houston kept my interest even when the plot was confusing and not interesting. The ending was not sad nor very tense. To me it just kind of ended."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Since I'm apparently the only person in the world who thinks this movie is terrible (despite loving John Huston and Jack Nicholson), it's my duty to report to you that Prizzi's Honor is overlong, completely unfunny, and a waste of two hours; I went in expecting something near a great film and went out feeling that this should never be mentioned in the same sentence as Treasure of the Sierra Madre or The Man Who Would Be King."
5,Great Movie,I highly recommend this movie. The performances were great and so was the writing. I wished there had been some extras on the DVD .
4,A review of the DVD,"The video quality was very good. The picture was clear with bright colors and no artifacts. The sound seemed a bit washed out, or muted, especially during dialogue. It even seemed to be re-dubbed in some scenes. Absolutely no extras, not even subtitles, on this DVD. It was surprising how good the picture quality was considering there wasn't anything special about this DVD. Many criterion collection DVDs have worse pictures. Mainly a DVD to get if you enjoy the film."
3,Wedding Sound Track - a joke?,"Got the DVD ... a few days ago, and must say I'm amazed at the poor sound quality towards the end of the wedding scene. The Ave Maria solo is fine, quite moving in fact; but the organ music which follows and accompanies the end of the scene ""wows"" something horrible. Was this on the original sound track and I missed it? or is it some sort of joke by the transfer department. The well placed mafia could surely have afforded a decent church organ, or have I missed the point and this is yet another piece of black comedy? As a film I enjoyed it first time round, and the apart from the above the transfer is OK - a bit lacking in extras, but at least it's free from cheesy adverts."
3,"Good movie, disappointing DVD","This film is difficult to classify: Comedy? Black comedy? Social commentary? However, in judging a film, I believe it is unimportant whether the film expresses or remains true to its particular genre. I also believe that insisting on the movie having ""a point"" is indicative of limited, two-dimensional thought. (What is the point of a Monet?) Instead, I ask how well it held my attention and interest, and how much it made me reflect afterwards. This movie accomplished all of these. While it is not a great film - it did not make me see life in a new way - it is a good film. The ending is weak, and the photography is only average. However, the acting is superb, and the script tickles the imagination. The DVD, on the other hand, is only acceptable because of the lack of features. Four stars for the movie, two-and-a-half for the DVD."
1,Microphone does not project sound to headphones,"Ordered and received KOSS SB-45 Communication Stereophones two weeks ago. Shipping and delivery from Amazon was great.Regarding the headphones and microphone, the sound quality is good on the receiving end. Unfortunately sound quality from the microphone is slightly garbled - based on recorded voice tests. Most disappointing however is the fact I cannot hear myself talk over the microphone (there was no voice-feedback). If you have ever talked to someone wearing safety earmuffs, you get a feeling of how distracting this can be. You don't know if you are speaking loud enough or too softly. I work a lot through internet collaboration websites, and I found that it was simply better to use my smart-phone rather than these headphones.Having thrown away the packaging, I am doubtful I can return this set to Amazon for a refund. Be assured, unless this is a malfunction in the Koss headset, I will not purchase another product from this brand."
1,Very poor quality,The headphones are cheap made and the microphone does not work. It is not worth the time to send it back.
1,Never again through this company,I ordered these headphone and when I received them I opened the package and I had received a Universal charger instead. Was not happy. The packing slip and the sticker on the bag said that is was the headphones but no headphone. The company did reimburse me but I really wanted my headphones and now i have to order somewhere else and wait again.
4,Great phones for the price,"These headphones are great for the price. Fit comfortably, sound is good, mic is good. A better alternative to the chintzy little headphones and mic for a similar price."
2,"Had 3 of these, would not reccomend","I purchased this headset on 3 separate occasions. The first set, the wire connector between the headset and the inputs came loose at the headset juncture, and the sound ceased to work. The second set is my own fault, the cat got a hold of the wires and it was toast after a week (yes, I still have the cat and he is still unbelievably lovable). The third set the microphone is now completely shot for no apparent reason, and I see that another reviewer had a similar problem.I can't complain about the actual working headset - it's fantastic and comfortable as long as it works, but I just haven't been able to keep them for longer than 3-5 months before the go bad. Would not recommend due to durability issues, however."
2,microphone broke after 3 months,"I loved these headphones until the microphone broke 3 months into using them. I've now had them for over a year and a half because the sound quality is still great. As a WoW gamer, I NEED a working mic and prefer it on my headphones, which is why I got these in the first place. NOT WORTH IT! Find better ones! gl hf dd"
1,Why do I keep buying Koss?,"I like Koss's design when it comes to headphones, yet the product quality is sadly missing. It never lasts long even after I sent it back a few times to fix or replace. Yet it brakes or shorts out or the wires come apart."
3,Uncomfortable,"The audio quality is all right with this headset, but it feels like the earpads are crushing my head and ears."
2,Microphone only worked a few days,Microphone stopped working after a few days - of course I'd tossed all the packaging so no way to return it. I'd been careful with the headset but I suspect the cord or plug is weak and just prone to shorting. The headpiece itself is comfortable over-the-ears so ok as just headphones.
