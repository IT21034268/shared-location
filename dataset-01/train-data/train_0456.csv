5,The King Returns!,"Some new tunes and old favorites for long-time fans! ""Foggy Windows"" is still my favorite, but ""I Cleaned Out A Room (In My Trailer For You),""Lingerie,"" ""Peace, Love, and Hard Liquor,"" ""I Quit All That Mess"" and plenty of others cement The King's place in music history. Hell, he is music history. Buy this CD!!! As a matter of fact, forget all that rock mess that any idiot can play and buy a couple dozen copies of the CD, stand on the street corner and pass 'em out to people. The King'll thank you for it."
5,Wimmerns Like it.,"If it is true that Unknown has stopped making music now, the world has lost a gem. This stuff is GOLD"
3,"cheesy, but fun","If you're a Squidbillies fan, this is the voice of the main character. His voice is definitely one of a kind. His songs are goofy and lighthearted so not a Billboard album but fun to listen to with friends."
1,The Future is Unknown,"Unknown Hinson is an incredible guitarist.He's great live, in interviews, and on Squidbillies.I do not like this CD. It is cheesy, over-produced glam-country.But I will still buy his new album."
2,Not was I Expected,"I caught the UnKnown one in March of 2003. At the time I was impressed by what I saw; The stage presence, the funny lyrics, and terrific guitar playing. This stuff would sound great on Disc.The one positive is that the lyrics are pretty funny, along with great titles like I make faces when I make love, and the doll song is too funny.One of the attractive aspects of seeing the Unkown one live was the great sound achieve with a three piece band. The sound of the strings made me cringe. The rock songs sounded too sanitary and klunky, and the overall pace of the album is poor. Hopefully the Unkown one will strip it down for future efforts."
5,A must have game.,"The best game in the world and the longest played game ever. Currently, item can be shipped only to U.S. addresses. We outside of U.S. cannot buy this game, but we love to get one. So, you who are in the U.S., why shouldn't you get one?"
2,Not another one....,I recieved this from a friend for my birthday. It looked cool; new money tokens and such. But there is one flaw. IT IS ANOTHER MONOPOLY! There has to be at least 30 different types of this game out already. So why buy this new one?
5,"So over the top, quality suffers","Firstly, I've already written a review here which I wrote when I first got the game, now that I've had time to play with it for a while, serious flaws have turned up. 1: The boards shiny, silvery surface looks so cool on the box, actually causes the board to curl which means your pieces slide right of the property squares, knocking down your houses. 2: The money. At first I knew the oney curled up but it didn't really bother me, now I've played with it a lot more, the money really starts to bug you as each note is practicly a see-saw! 3: The outer transparent box. After you've put the tin in and out the box for a while, the lid will begin to tear and if your not careful, will rip off completely. For the price this isn't worth it if your going to be using it as a family game. This is only worth it if your never going to play it and keep it as a collectable."
4,Where Are My Jeweled Dice?,"I recently received my Monopoly Millenium Game after months of waiting for the item to become available again. I feel this edition of Monopoly is excellent except for one, blunderous flaw. Instead of orange, jewel shaped dice, my game came with orange, but traditionally shaped dice. I am outraged! I believe that Hasbro should mail each person who purchased this game a new set of dice as well as a written apology for the emotional devastation that their false advertising has caused."
5,"the basic monopoly, just a little different","If you liked the original Monopoly, you'll like the 2000 edition too. The new edition is just the same as the original, but has a few visual changes. This special edition features simi-transparent money, new game pieces such as TVs and cell phones, and stackable houses. The 2000 edition also comes in a square box, with a 4 way foldable game board. The money has a tendecy to curl up, as it's made of some kind of plastic, not paper. The money is also very sharp on the ends b/c of the plastic, and can poke you if you aren't careful, but is is also more durable. Overall this is pretty much the same as the original, but still slightly different."
5,Incredible Band: They are a must see live!!!,"I once had a regular email address, but changed it because I want everyone to know I was one of the first to support these guys before they are huge. While I am still waiting for their next release, I am absolutely amazed they are not signed to a major record deal right now. I fortunately saw them live at Las Vegas and the live show blows the CD away. With catchy heavy tracks like ""Forget About It"" and ""Dada"", don't miss the ballad turn mosh pit song ""Deep Water"". And who can turn them away when they throw ""Pimp the Nation"" at you as the last song on the CD!! Be on the look out for these guys very soon."
2,Needs more than an off switch,"Two big problems with this toy. First, its grammar is atrocious: Mr. Potato Head tells kids ""you did good,"" rather than ""well,"" which countermands any ""educational"" value it may have. (Why can't toy makers at least get this right? Kids learn by repeating!) Second, you can't turn it off. When you ignore it, Mr. Potato Head yawns and tells the kid to push a button before he goes to sleep. If you have direction-oriented kids as I do, this thing will NEVER turn off. At one point, my 3 year old was apologizing to the toy, saying that she couldn't press the button because she was holding Mama's hand. Very annoying."
3,"Bad, but better than that Candy Land game.","I just bought this at someone's garage sale for my little brother, because he loves Toy Story, so I bought this for his 3third birthday hoping he will like it...I was wrong. He got bored playing it in seven miutes! That stupid game keeps turning on by itself, even if nobody's in that room, and it takes fore or five minutes to wait for him to turn himself off!I'm rating this one a three, because it's a little (but not much) better than the Candy Land - Electronic Hand-Held game! At least Mr. Potato Head's in color!!!!!!If you wanna give your kids/relatives/friends a game that's quiet, and entertaining, try buying the Mr. Potato Head doll!!!"
2,Frightening Grammar,"If you do well, Mr. Potato Head says, ""You did good!"" Yikes! If you are trying to teach your children even passable grammar, a toy like this will set your efforts back immeasurably."
2,"Just say ""NO!""","I agree with the other reviewer...this toy definitely needs an off switch. I purchased this toy thinking it would be a good diversion for my three-year old on a long car trip. Boy was I wrong. He liked it well enough, but quickly became bored with it. And the fact that you can't turn it off is a real TURN OFF! Arghhh! We have woken up in the middle of the night to hear ""Hi, I'm Mister Potato Head""...when the toy was in the toy box. It seems to be easily 'set-off' and will jabber on for about 5 minutes before shutting itself off. I'd steer clear of this one. There are plenty of other toys out there that DO have an off switch!"
2,"Ugh, be quiet already","My daughter enjoyed this toy for about a week - it was her first handheld game so she was naturally excited about it even though it's not much fun. It's biggest problem is that it doesn't have an OFF button and it goes on and on before it finally gets quiet (back in the days she occasionally played with it, she would shove it into a closet or under a pillow when she was finished). The second biggest problem is that it seems to have a mind of its own and randomly starts talking when no one is touching it (Nothing I hate more than a haunted toy). I haven't even seem my daughter's game since moving into a new house four months ago. I know it's there because I hear it talking on a regular basis. If I ever find it, it's going in the give away pile."
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!!,"For one thing you can not turn this game off and it becomes very annoying listening to it prompt you to push a button.Next, it does not hold my daughters attention. She got this 2 years ago for Christmas and she is now 6 and has never enjoyed this game.It is difficult for young children to use."
2,Religous testimonial,"This isn't a bad personal memoir of WWII, although any ""truth in packaging"" requirement would mandate that the title include the fact that the author spends considerable space expounding his religious views. Zamperini certainly led an interesting life, and clearly had a run of incredibly good luck over the decades. His experiences as a captive of the Japanese are interesting in their own right, although there is really nothing exceptional in his story. My biggest complaint about the book -- other than the fact that it's just an average memoir -- is the excessive attention given to his involvement with Billy Graham and his personal faith. Had I known this facet of the story beforehand, I would never had bought the book."
5,Inspiring story,"I read Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken before I read this book. From reading Unbroken, I know that everything he says in this book is true and documented. It is an amazing story. I liked this book better than Unbroken, but would never just read one without the other. This is a story about his life so how can anyone be offended by the fact that he is religious--that is his life. Also, I think you need to be an overly optimistic person in order to have survived all that he did. He is a survivor, and survivors tend to be opportunists and self promoters, but what is wrong with that. I would bet that if he were growing up today he would be diagnosed with ADD or ADHD and would not have been able to have accomplished all that he did because he would have been stifled by treatment and a system that wants everyone to be the same."
4,Couldn't put it down! Miraculous Survival!,"I'm a wife & mother age 52 who just finished reading this book in 2 days! I've never read a war story before. My husband & daughter both love the history & military channel. I heard Louie on a Cleveland radio ""phone in"" interview about a month ago. After hearing part of his ordeal, I knew this was an interesting man. I just had to read his full story. It was shocking! My husband and daughter also read the book. Once you started reading it, you couldn't put it down. I can't believe he survived after all the horror he went through on the raft for 47 days BEFORE getting rescued by the enemy! His 2 year prison ordeals were so inhumane. I just wanted him to get home safe without anymore harm. I'm happy he conquered his many demons and was able to forgive. After you read what he endured,you wonder how the latter is even possible!! God bless Louie! What an amazing man!"
1,BRAGGER !,This guy is so full of himself it made me sick. Page after page of bragging and false humility. Because he exaggerates his own greatness so much it makes me unsure as to what parts of his story are accurate.
4,Devil at My Heels,Good read and at times breathtaking in it's descriptions of his capture by the Japanese during the second world war.This book was written in the hero's own voice.
5,Devil at my Heels,Excellent reading and is a real test of human survival. I think that the world should always remember the badly some of our prisoners of war were treated. Or should I say mistreated.
5,Outstanding book!,This is a truly amazing story of this man's life and the ordeals he went through during the war. The courage and tenacity he used to get through the ordeals he faced would be almost impossible to find today.
4,a good storyfor all ages,"male or female,a page turner and life lessons on the strength of will power when you needit most and you get you through life."
3,Problems with the transfer,"eBook:There are a couple issues with the electronic version. There are some typos, most noticeably the fact that ""lie"" is sometimes used where the word ""him"" should be. There are also references to floorplans and a writing sample, but these do not seem to be included in the electronic version. While the writing sample is not crucial, the floorplan would help clarify movements of characters during the commission of the crime.Content:All in all this is a good story. I read ""The House of the Whispering Pines"" just recently and this is very much in that style. Lots of fainting and several comments about a ""woman's place,"" combined with detailed detective work and an impressive grasp on crime. It's an unusual combination. It's a quick read - I had a hard time putting it down as I wanted to know what happens next. All in all very enjoyable story."
2,The Woman in the Alcove,This is not my kind of book found it hard to follow and bit old fashioned took a long time to say something
2,too proper for me,a very proper mystery thusly to boring for me in fairness i guess i enjoy more of a thriller that is a page turner
4,Arctophiles unite!,Great magazine. All the bear essentials from Steiff to Russ they cover the territory
3,Doesn't Bennett Like Anything?,"Joe Bennett's two books, WHERE UNDERPANTS COME FROM and HELLO DUBAI are excellent and well written. A LAND OF TWO HALVES is whiny and negative. More about hitchhiking and pubs than New Zealand, it could pretty much have been set anywhere. I learned very little about New Zealand and more than I needed to know about Bennett's personal habits. From a very good writer, this book was disappointing."
1,Train Wreck,"I learned more about Joe Bennet's bodily functions by reading this book than about any aspect of New Zealand. He enjoys drinking to excess with strapping NZ country boys and peeing off of cliffs. There, you don't have to order this book, unless you enjoy reading about being a repressed homosexual misogynists who cares nothing for nature's grandeur. Oh, and I defy you to find a paragraph that is not chock full of metaphor or simile. Joe, do us a favor and stay out of the travel literature genre."
1,"Unreadable, pages out of order",This Vintage International edition of this book was unreadable -- all the pages were out of order. Don't order this edition.
4,"Passionate, gripping, and beautiful.","""The Wild Palms"" is one of the most compelling love stories I've ever read: a story about decision and indecision, passion and failure, love and loss. ""Old Man"" provides some of the most exciting scenes I've ever read, as the tall convict shows his strong sense of duty and honor in the face of his only chance of freedom."
3,Fools and Reprobates,"I'm beginning to think this is the best way to read Faulkner: take two completely unrelated stories and intermix them, so you at least have a respite from one story while you dig through the other. Actually, in all fairness, this is both one of Faulkner's more comprehensible and relatable outings. Nevertheless, it's filled with his usual suspects - fools and reprobates - which makes it difficult to like."
1,Disappointed,"I've purchased these before a couple years ago. This time I bought 4 pkgs, and was disappointed. The pieces are now thinner and have mold flashing at the seams. The prongs that do the job of holding onto the peg board are smaller, and do not do a very good job. I would return them, but the cost of shipping and my time handling them again would not be worth it. Live and learn."
2,Don't have high expectations,"Bought several packages of these. Have been underwhelmed. Made of flimsy plastic and have almost as hard of time staying in as the peg hooks. Better than nothing but not much. May try to make my own out of piano wire.As always, Amazon did a great job in delivery of product."
5,Excellent transaction,"I purchased a ""box"" of these locks and they sure do make life easier when replacing or removing tools from my pegboard. I called the company that was selling them through Amazon.com and they were extremely helpful and informative."
5,Works as advertised,does what it is supposed to as long as the pegboard hooks have a part long enough to be over an open hole.
3,Save your $$ and use a ZIP TIE,"Sure these are nice, but you lose two holes using the peg lock.Just use a nylon zip tie to strap the peg to the board for a system that won't pop out.Only thing is you have to have access to the rear of the board.This is done by a simple hinge design.Do a Google search for peg lock Lifehacker and you'll see the article."
3,light duty is right,Had trouble locking these clips onto the peg board. I don't know if they are too short or the hook is not long enough.
1,My comments,"These peg locks are very ""light"" and ""flimsy"" and do not do what they are intended to do. If I had been able to visually see them in a store, I never would have purchased them!"
2,How to make them work....,"I also felt they did not work very well. We are using a pegboard in place of a coat rack and the hooks keep falling out. I made a tutorial to show you how to make them work. Now, they never fall off.[...]"
2,Check your pegboard hole size before ordering.,"These do NOT work on the newer pegboards I recently purchased a Lowes. The hole size on a lot of new pegboards is 1/2"" and these locks just fall out. They don't work very well on the older version pegboards with 3/16"" holes either, but they do stay in the pegboard, . . . sorta!"
1,Loose,"Plastic locks do not secure hooks well enough, they keep falling out of the peg board holes. Another buyersuggested heating them up and bending them before the locks become rigid again. This worked well..... thanks forthe tip."
3,rr,"They work ok, will do the job, but do not fit my 1/8 peg board real snug. First shipment, only received 15 locks in my package, but Ace Direct responded very quickly with another package of locks, extremely happy with their response to my complaint."
3,Feline Online,"Feline OnlineBy: Elyse CregerFeline Online is a well-written book that I recommend for my age (I'm 11). Feline Online is about two cats, Tarzan, a cat who can read, and Foo Foo, a chunky, sun bathing, eating machine. Bastet, the ancient Egyptian cat goddess, gives Tarzan the power to read. One day Tarzan mistakenly orders a very disruptive parrot online, when he thinks he's ordering a cute, little parakeet. Come find out what happens to the two cats.I personally hate cats, so that affects my opinion. It was a good book, but not the best. This is my personal opinion of the book Feline Online by Elyse Creger."
3,Student of author,"Elyse Cregar has been working in our libray for an enormous amount of time. She is talented as a writer and artist. However, this book did not strike me as one of the best. The book was a fiction about a cat who learns to read and write becuase of a dream. The book is not very exciting but it is interesting especially for a cat owner. I would not recomend this book as a favorite but it's a good book to pass the time."
5,Smart Kitty Kapers!!!,"I LOVED this book. It is fun, educational, and very well written. You get a hilarious plot, strong Siamese and human characters (Foo-Foo is so lazy you can hardly believe it), and fascinating mysteries involving the ancient cat gods of Egypt. What more could anyone ask for??? Plus,the descriptions of Amanda and her use of sign language are extraordinary. This book is all about the beauty and mystery of communication--what cats and people crave."
3,Feline Online,Join the internet adventure with Tarzan the smart cat in the book Feline Online By:Elyse Cregar. Tarzan and Foo Foo his caompanion get themselves into trouble many times in this story.You might never see a cat as smart as Tarzan the cat who surfs the internet. In the last sentence of the last chapter the words where will his knowledge lead him is a wonderful way to end this magical story.
4,Feline Online is good or bad?????????,"When I read Feline Online, different opinions came to mind. At the beginning of the book it was a little boring because it was introducing the characters. It started to get more interesting around chapter six, Tarzan of the Internet. This was the first time I have ever heard of a cat using the Internet. The most exciting part of the book was the ending. This was when Amanda found out about Tarzan's power. Overall, I think this book was great. If Elyse Cregar wrote a sequel to Feline Online, I would be one of the first people to read it."
1,Don't Bother,This book is fairly tedious to read. It has a fairly boring plot unless you are really fascinated with cats and Egypt. It is obvious that the author had little understanding of computers. I really did not enjoy this book.
1,Peach is down the toilet!,"Unless you find performing bodily functions erotic then give this book a pass. If the bathroom stuff is what gets you going then this book is definitely for you, you will love it from beginning to end."
3,lesbianism and excretion,"I do not rat this book as highly as intertainment. I found the unusual handling of excretory scenes daring, but not something I would want to read every day. I do not like lesbian scenes and they are many in this book."
2,"Nice idea, didn't work.","The idea is nice, the settings work - had Zelazny written it, it would probably have been a great book. As it is, it's simply a missed opportunity. Too bad. One or two of the chapters are OK, most are just boring, and none are Zelazny - style. Don't bother."
2,"Compact, weak, dead","Mine just died after a few months of use. Kind of fragile and light... and top-heavy - a bad combination. You get what you pay for I guess. Also, if you are using this in a cold office, you'll definitely want something bigger. It barely warmed my feet."
5,works great!,"I have researched a lot of heaters and tried some other heaters and I still like this better. This is the second year I use this heater, it still works very good. I use it at my small bedroom( 9*13 ) it can warms it up within 30 minutes, if I use two of it at a living room ( 14* 18 ), it will makes the room go up to 70 degree (the fan will warms up the room very fast! )I think the simple design is best, as heater , it really doesn't need too many extra function."
5,great time,Love it and over 21. This classic game now has easily recognizable characters from Disney to be both educational and lots of fun for all ages.
4,Loved It!,"In the ever diminishing area of ""just good fantasy"" it is nice to find a book to feel comfortable with. I usually read 2 -3 books a week and struggle through a lot of ""drugstore paperbacks"" just to feed a fix. This book was great ! The lady is out there writing a great story not just selling print. Cannot wait for the rest of the story."
3,"good story, poor quality ebook","So far I am rather enjoying the story, however, when the ebook is twice the price of a print copy I expect that the content isn't full of typos...frustrated by the constant distraction, which is keeping me from really being absorbed by the tale.There is a name Blas which about 50% of the time is spelled Bias. I know I sound picky, but I just can't ignore it."
4,A Modest Success,"This workmanlike set of translations gives hints of the beauty and power of Mistral's poetry and prose, but I've read more moving translations of the same poems. Nonetheless, it's one of only two available through Amazon.com in English, and better to have a hint than nothing at all. A highly revered figure in South America and a Nobel Prize winner, Mistral should be better known here than she is."
4,Good Poetry,"This book of poems was one which was put together very nicely. I liked how all the poems were grouped together by having similarities. It made them some what easier to understand when reading them. Not one to be to enthusiastic about reading poetry, I was surprised to actually take a strong liking to some of the poems. The ones that struck me the most were:""Rocking"", ""The Future,"" ""The Rose,"" ""Song Of The Dead Girls"", and ""The Christmas Star"".These poems seemed to stick out to me from all that were selected to be in the book.The only part about this text I didn't appreciate too much was the selections of prose..), maybe me being from a different country than Mistral I was unable to relate to them, but other than that I would highly recommend this book to everyone, even if one is not interested in poetry. It may catch your attention because it definitely did catch mine."
5,Superb piece of writing,"Just by reading ""A Reader"" by Gabriela Mistral one is able to experience the beauty of artistical language. Mistral's message to her readers depicts her real attitude toward life and how confidence she is of her profound feelings. Hungry readers will find satisfaction by understanding Mistral's content and enriching their cultural background. Mistral's word in ""A Reader"" is sufficient to open one's mind to see a different horizon. One will be able to find new ways to express sentiments that have been hidden in our hearts"
5,A fun game for the family,"Our three kids love this game. The youngest (2 years old) is too young really understand, but she's capable of rolling the dice and handing us the correct piece. The 4 and 9 year old enjoy it, even though it is a little simple for the 9 year old (she likes the regular Yahtzee too). The four year old needs a little help deciding what to do, but not much, and they all love the Disney characters."
5,ya gotta get this game!!,"We bought this game for our twin 6 yr old girls and they love it! It is a fun family game. It is very easy to learn and they play it over and over. And they can play just the two of them, no need for a parent to remind them of the rules.Great game, a definite must for your family."
1,Couldn't get the facts right,"Initially, I was really excited and ready to read this ""historically accurate"" mystery, because I have always loved Buddy Holly's music and the period it came from. All the pre-publication reviews talked about how wonderfully Gorman evoked the period and had researched his subject.Well, it's difficult to buy into the research the author did, considering he got the date that Buddy Holly died, ie. ""the day the music died"" WRONG!!! Big time oops.Tried to get into the book but found it pretty lame for a mystery and worse as historical fiction."
2,retro revisionism,"The characters and action in this book are possessed of a political correctness that did not exist in the Heartland (or probably anywhere else) at the time (whichever time that happens to be - February 3, 1958 or 1959 - see previous reviews.) In a time when June Cleaver wore chic dresses and real pearls everyday to wash & wax the kitchen floor, the author expects us to believe that one of the main characters is a FEmale judge and another main female character intends to go to law school? It just wasn't like that then.Another error - let's try a little sing-a-long here: o/~ 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 . tell the people what she wore. She wore an itsy bitsy, teeny weenie, _____ polka dot bikini o/~ The author gets gonged here because he says it was pink. [p. 154, original hardcover ed.] Those of us old enough to know better will tell you it was yellow.The mystery is just so-so and the ambiance the author takes pains to create is simply not credible because he needed fact checks!"
2,Dissapointing,"As historical fiction, and as a mystery, this books fails. Besides occasional references to convertibles and AM radio, the story could have been from any time. The mystery is uninvolving, and ultimately dissappointing."
5,Coaching As An Act of Service,"Doug Silsbee offers a rare perspective in writing for a business context. He speaks from a deeply personal experience of his own journey and how helping others must begin with looking at self.This is a powerful book because it is written with a commitment to personal honesty, truth telling, and service. Doug makes a very strong case that this is what coaching is and should be all about."
1,Photo-reproduction of old book,"This book was a big disappointment. Rather than freshly typeset a book, the publisher photo-reproduced an out-of copyright work. That might not have been so bad, but they priced it like something of much higher quality, and evidently reduced it in size from the original. I can't be sure they shrank it, but the printing is small, perhaps 8 points. They omit the date for the original work, only saying--for copyright reasons--that it's from before 1923. It appears to be from the middle to late 1800s.You can find Robert Burns on Amazon in several books that are of much higher quality and at a lower price."
2,S'Alright toy.,"My boy recieved this one for Christmas last year. I have to confess that I probably played with it more than he did, and it was consigned to the closet soon after. The problem is that it outpaces reaction time at an incredible rate.If your kid's the type to be turned off by that lack of instant gratification, and the lack of a difficulty switch, don't bother.But if you want one for yourself, for the fun of whacking something, have at it."
3,Fun Playing Bob It Extreme,"When I played Bop It Extreme for the first time, I was like, wow, is this a fun toy or what! It might be challenging, but it was exetremely fun. This toy really gets you to pay attention! It requires one thing. And that is speed. If your hands go slow, you will lose! But it also requires another thing. It requires you to have fun. :)"
4,Fun from 7 to 77,"We bought this game for my nephew. Not only did he play withit, but so did his uncles, aunts, cousins, mom, and dad. Even thebaby cousins wanted in on the fun. We played it alone, we played it together. We played it so much the first night the batteries went dead. The only complaint I have is that it is loud and there is no volume control. I have ordered one for my husbands birthday. It is the only thing he has asked for specifically."
5,extreme fun!,"Educational? I don't think so, but let Frasier Crane worry about that! I'm a full-tilt grown-up, and I bought this for my office - it's like an instant dance party."
5,Really Fun,"I got this game around August. We have had regular Bop-it for a long time, and saw a big difference for the better with the new one! The voice is clearer, it is better for groups becauese it is easier to pass, and it is more fun."
5,I had way too much fun with this toy...,"When I received a BopIt Extreme for Christmas, I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. I was 18! What did I want with a toy? When I finally opened it in a moment of boredom 3 weeks later, I played with it for at least 2 hours (that's a guess; I actually lost track of time). I had so much fun with this toy. It can be immensly frustrating when you lose--and it insults you--but that is more than compensated for when you finally reach the nearly-impossible score of 250. It is an excellent test of speed and reflexes, and the multiplayer mode encourages cooperation and teamwork. I loved BopIt Extreme!"
5,A keeper!,"With three children, I have seen many toys come and go (most too quickly). This toy is a keeper. We have found once you pick it up ... you can't put it down!"
5,Extreme Fun,This is a great game for people of all ages. It combines fun with excitement. You can play by yourself or with your friends. You need to get this item for extreme fun and competition. I got this for Christmas and haven't stopped playing.
5,Bop it Extreme II is the best!!,Bop it Extreme II is a really fun game. I first played it at my friend's house. We played it for hours and held exciting competitions. It is probably one of the best electronic games that I have ever played!
4,Bop It Extreme,This toy is a very fun game. It's pritty durable and if I were bored I would just get my bop-it extreme and play. GET THIS GAME!!
3,"Ain't the thing I was expecting,","Hi ya people,once again I got a nother toy. It is kind of fun in a way. Now, on to the review. In a way it is fun. I mean, sheesh, go buy bop it extream 2. This thing don't even have something to make it SHUT$& ! Yeah, there is'nt much differince in the game thingies. No diff at all. Next to that bop it extrem 2 has a head phone plug to lisin and play without disterbing anyone. Now, bop it extrem before you play choose what setting you want. I know beep-bop solo is when you play by yourself. Bop box is when you here tunes and noises. I don't know about the other settings. They ain't all that challenging. I bet you are wondering how to turn it off. Well, after you lost put it down gentley and it is automaticley shut off. So I recomend bop it extrem 2 more than I recomend bop it extrem. Hope this review was helpful! Late"
4,Bop It Rules.,"My stepbrother had one of these on his keyring, and I would hear him playing with it for hours. The song started to get really annoying so I went over and asked him what it was. Once I tried it, I was totally addicted to it and had to get one. I am 24! I got my mom and my sister one and they both became Bop It addicts as well. Although I have to say, after about 3 days it gets really old. But, I just put mine down and pick it up a few days later and it's fun again.The Pro's: It's really fun and can be somewhat challenging. It's not as mindless a game as most other ones on the market.The Cons: Sometimes it doesn't start correctly. Also, sometimes when you do what it tells you to do, it still screams at you. Mine only works right about 60% of the time, but usually if you play with it long enough it starts working again.NOTE: A word of advice. This toy will ANNOY the life out of anyone within earshot, especially if they have not played it."
5,Great for the whole family,"I purchased this toy about two years ago for a teenager and he still plays with it! In fact, the whole family plays with Bop It Extreme, including my four year old. This is a great toy for everyone."
4,"Loads of Fun, A Bit Hard to Hear","Our lab bought the Bop It Extreme to play at parties and get-togethers. We found it to be an extremely addicting and fun game, and a great group game. The toy isn't meant for really young children who aren't able to move fast enough. It was also hard to hear the commands when in a group situation. The Bop It is EXTREMELY durable, and it lasted through tossings and scratches."
4,Very Fun!!!!,"I'm 12, but when I turned 11 or so, I got Bop It Extreme as a present.I think this toy is VERY fun!! It's can amuse you for a long time, and it's challenging too. It's fun trying to beat your old score, and really fun to play with a friend.For education, I think it can help develop hand-eye coordination.I definately recommend this toy!!!! I got it a year ago and I STILL play with it!! The *only* problem is that is can be a little annoying to other people because it's a little loud...but just go into another room!!This is a VERY fun toy!!"
4,Great fun toy,"I bought this for my son when he was 7 and he and his friends loved it & played with it often. That was a year ago and it's still working, though he doesn't play with it much over the past few months."
5,Extreme Bop It,I purchased this toy for my 11 year old nephew for Christmas. What fun the entire family had playing it. It is durable; very educational. Children and adults need to remember the actions. The only deficiency there is no volume control...not conducive after late nights.! A must toy for any age.
5,Warning to Parents!!,"This is a great toy for children, and they will love it. However, you as a parent will hate it. It is extremely loud and after your kids play it constantly for hours on end you are on the brink of insanity. So basically what you need to ask yourself is Are you more worried about your kids happiness or your own sanity. On the other hand it does help improve memory skills. Another game which is not quite as loud that is similar to this one is Simon 2 by Hasbro. I think this one is a little better though."
5,Grandaughter has BopIt Great toy!,On my way to a great vacation in the Pocono's with my son and his family. Niita took out the toy and started playing with. I was amazed at what it can do. So I just mailed her about Extreme Bop It
5,"Lots of fun, great for a group party","My boss bought one for the office. We have been having a lot of fun with it. This model allows you to select play for one or play for a group. It also has two difficulty settings, one with voice commands and one with only sounds to guide you. I'm buying one now to take home for the holidays!"
4,all good until it got to the hot tub,"great toy for parties, can probly be used for drinking games, but once it got wet that was the end of the fun. can really get younger kids frustrated if they don't have the dexterity."
2,Disappointed...,"I am a teacher and collect lots of games. I seem to remember enjoying the electronic game 'Simon' as a child, and had read good reviews of 'Bop-It' here, so I ordered one. It was fun for about the first 15 minutes. The song and voice are too repetetive (and annoying), and for an adult, the challenge of the game just wasn't fun. There are only 2 different versions of basically the same game programmed into it (boring). I'd recommend going to a toy store and finding the much more creative version of the same principle, an electronic game called 'Brain Warp' which pleases many different intellects. I did pass 'Bop-It' around at a party of educators and of 15 of us only 2 enjoyed this game."
5,Had it a year and still love it!,"This was a Christmas presesnt for our 13 year old in 1999, and the whole family, from our 8 year old up enjoyed it -- and still does! It has been a lot of fun. Its only negatives are that the voice can be a little annoying at times, and we have experienced trouble with ""who gets to play with it next."" Also, it is very addictive, because you always want to beat your last score!"
5,"Like tobacco, but not.","Let me put it this way: it takes a while to put it down, especially when you're trying to get the high score but failing each time. It's very fun, but very time consuming because if its addictiveness. Buy at your own risk. I love it. I need to play it again..."
3,Fun- For a little while,"When you first start playing with Bop It, it's fun. Kind of like a new simon for a new generation of kids. Even adults like it, for a little while. After a couple of days, it just gets boring. You only pick it up only about once every two months. So my opinion is, don't buy it unless you have tried it, and absolutly love it."
5,Addictive,"My 8 year old son, his friends, and my wife and I - LOVE this toy. It is a ton of fun and very addictive. I agree that a year from now, we will not be playing with it every waking moment, which we are doing at this time, but it is great fun now. Moreover, its apparent sturdy construction and lack of tiny parts to get lost, ensures that if we want to play with it a year from now, we can. I highly recommend this toy."
5,CANT PUT IT DOWN!,"This is such a great toy! We bought it for our 7 yr old but it seems like his mom and dad are playing it more than our child is! It teaches fast thinking and quick reflexes, and is an absolute blast! I highly recommend bop it extreme!"
5,Great for older kids,"We got this for my son when he was 9. He is now 10 1/2 and still loves it and plays with it regularly. This is a good challenging game and even we, the parents love it. One thing my son loves about it, is that you can set it to play a variety of different games and when he gets really good with one game, there is another one to challenge him. He can play by himself or with others."
4,bop it,"my cousin got this toy for xmas, and after about 10 times he got tired of it even though it is difficult, and builds detirmiination. it was difficult for a 14 year old, so don't buy them unless your kid is detirmined because it's very hard!"
4,WHOA!,"Find it, get it and wow! Stay tuned for tracks 14, 15, 16, 17 which are not listed on the product. This album makes me wanna drive real fast and yell and scream! Try it, you'll like it!"
4,Interesting; 3.5 Stars,A short collection of ironic essays by the great poet Zbigniew Herbert. Each essay is an ironic re-telling of a Classical myth or story. Some include allegorical commentary on contemporary events. Generally quite clever and with some intermittently striking language. Not major works but enjoyable.
5,Christ Centered,"As with all good Christian biography books, Scots Worthies offers you a glimp into the lives of God's people in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. I believe its central message is to amaze you with God's amazing grace towards sinners. This book could have been called the jewels of the Holy Spirit. If you are intrested in God's power to save sinners, then this book is a must for every libary. If you thirst to see the power of God unto salvation, then drink deeply of this book and cherish the fruit that is evidenced in the lives of these godly people."
4,Lots of Fun - Great Exercise,"We've really enjoyed this game. Our only complaint is that the music is not really our preference. It was obviously intended for a younger audience. Regardless, we've had a lot of fun playing."
2,broken plastic case,Delivered with outside plastic case broken(this is the first time for me to see something delivered damaged and delivered for a stuff bought from Amazon). Fortunately DVD software inside was O.K.
2,bitter poppy seed,apparently there is no way of fixing bitter poppy seed. Maybe someone has an idea? I still have half a package
3,"For nostalgia, not for parties.","Enjoyable to listen to and to reflect upon, but probably isn't going to liven up a party. As with most early demos and such, the polished quality of the group just isn't there on most tracks. Still, it takes one back to when the Byrds flew high."
4,you need it,"Any fan of the Byrds and Gene Clark should have this in their collection . I never had either half of this material when it was released previously by both Rhino and Together, and put off buying it due to spotty reviews. Throw that mess out of your mind and get a copy . The Sundazed label did a great job on the whole package and it's a valuable addition to my collection. The sets have a lot of fascinating stuff , but hearing the original acoustic version of "" you Showed Me The Way "" by itself is worth it."
5,Birth of a Legendary Band,Essential listening for die-hard byrd fans. Gene Clark was such a great songwriter. Too bad that the byrds didn't use more of his songs.
4,Greatest Hits,"It's an overall nice compilation, however it could do without Let Your Heart Do All the Talking, The Final Cut and With Or Without You - which are the 3 weakest songs on this album. Also, I do not like the version of Heartbreak Lullaby they have on this album."
5,Excellent Songs,I enjoy their music I like their song Can't Help Falling In Love With You from Lilo and Snitch the first movie
5,Excellent!!!!,"This album has all my fav. A*Teens hits! It's a GREAT Album for all loyal fans and for all those that like great up-beat songs. It has some of their best Abba singles, ""Dancing Queens"", ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Gimmie,Gimmie,Gimmie"". And their recent #2 hit in Sweden ""I Promised Myself"". The album also has some nice soft POP songs like ""Perfect Match"", ""Sugar Rush"", ""Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" and ""Heartbreak Lullaby"". It also features party hits like ""Floorfiller"". Their Top 100 Billboard Hit ""Bouncing off the Ceiling"" and new material. This album rocks and should be a great present to anyone from the young to the seniors. I give this album a 9.8/10 overall."
1,A really bad film,"Why Roger, oh why? Why did you have to make one last OO7film after the success of Octopussy. A View To a Kill is possibly the series' weakest effort. The action is crummy and very cheesey, Tanya Roberts almost brings down the whole film herself, and Grace jones is SO weird. Roger Moore looks like he's 7O and the only good actors in this film were Christopher walken and Patrick Macnee. I would give this film two stars but I hate the settings , they are so queer, and the plot is confusing and boring. Duran Duran provides an okay title but John barry's score is his worst."
5,awsome!!!!!!!,"this is the second best roger moore bond film 1is for your eyes only, 2nd is well a view to a kill, 3d is the spy who loved me and moonraker.this is rogers last movie, he was 57 there but he is the best bond yet!this is a cool movie so buy it now!!!!!!!"
3,A View to a Kill,"The final outing of Roger Moore as James Bond and his weakest. An exciting teaser is followed by a mudane plot with less than adequate villans, uninteresting ladies, and lame action sequences (a steeple chase sequence and escaping from a burning building, not exactly up to the usual Bond standard). Thankfully the climax of Bond battling Zorin atop the Golden Gate Bridge, accompanied by John Barry's exciting score, is worth the price of the DVD. This DVD also includes an extra ""The Music of James Bond"" paying tribute the the great works of John Barry, Shirley Bassey, David Arnold and others. It is worth adding to your shopping cart for the teaser and climax sequences."
5,A perfect blend of awesome nonsense,"Everything a Bond movie should be: far-fetched but interesting plot, charismatic villains, beautiful women, stunning exotic locations, lighthearted witty dialogues, amazing music, Bond's absurd invincibility and universal irresistibility... Somehow, most subsequent Bond iterations diluted at least some items of this formula in an effort to ""modernize"" Bond for the increasing sensitivities of the 21st century. So, is this all shaken or stirred the right way? That depends on your preferences. For me, this might have been the last Bond of its kind."
3,Cubby Broccoli made a bad choice,"A View to a Kill was not in the top ten of the Bond Films (actually ranked 15th). Though a stronger plot line than Tomorrow Never Dies, the thought of a 'British' agent coming to America to foil a caper is a bit thin. Yet another of the Bond films that was not a book by Ian Fleming (though it was a short in the paperback For Your Eyes Only), it lacked the international flavor that a true Bond film must have to be successful. Eon Pictures should have used one of the trade paperbacks ( Icebreaker or For Special Services) that had continued on with the Bond saga, instead of a short that was stretched past its limits to two hours"
1,"Was this ""Made for TV""?","The absolute WORST of ALL the Bond movies, Moore or otherwise. Walken gives his worst performance ever and the Bond girls are extremely ordinary looking. Even the lame action can't save this one. Grace Jones was the only thing 'Bond worthy' in this entire movie. Like a real bad episode of Charlie's Angels without Charlie or the Angels. Absolutely UNWATCHABLE and made for TV caliber script, acting, direction and camera work...."
4,not the best...FAR from the worst,"A View to a Kill is one of the best ""sit back and relax on a rainy day"" movies of the series, although Roger Moore, as always, gives an unanimated, dry, dull performance as the ""dapper"" Bond. Walken is a good Max Zorin, and Jones as Mayday is well-cast. A few of the action sequences are unimaginative and far-fetched. Such as the fire engine chase in SF, and the fight on the golden gate bridge, but all-in-all this a quirky, almost well-done, Bond that always keeps me entertained!!! You won't regret buying this film! Just for your information, whether it's helpful or not, here is how I rate the 7 Moore Bond films: 1. The Spy Who Loved Me 2. For Your Eyes Only 3. Octopussy 4. Live and Let Die 5. A View to a Kill 6. The Man With the Golden Gun 7. Moonraker"
3,"Good, but not great","A View To A kill was Roger Moores swansong as James Bond 007, and it isn't the disaster some people say it is. However it is let down badly by a weak script, and the script is one of the most important parts of any Bond film. But it does compensate with great villians (Christopher Walken, Grace Jones) some superb stunt sequences, and the usual trademark performance by Roger Moore (aged 57!) Not one of the more shining entries in the Bond series, though."
3,Roger Moore and his stunt dbls as James Bond,"Let's face it, this film is basically a bad reworking of GOLDFINGER with it's plot to destroy Silicon Valley and increase the value of villain Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) own computer chips. Grace Jones is bizaare (Connery would never have gone to bed with her), Tanya Roberts (the last -- and worst -- of CHARLIE'S ANGELS) couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag. Patrick MacNee is a saving grace but he isn't around too long. Gawd but poor Lois Maxwell looks she could be Bond's mother! Nice John Barry score with the theme a hit from Duran Duran -- the film title was altered from the original FROM A VIEW TO A KILL because Duran Duran felt it was too difficult to make into a lyric! The last of the Roger Moore era."
3,Underrated Roger Moore entry,"'A View to a Kill' may be the most underrated film in the James Bond series, simply because so many people think it is the worst of all. This is hardly true. Among Roger Moore entries, sure, it's no 'The Spy Who Loved Me' or 'For Your Eyes Only'...but it's a helluva lot better than 'The Man with the Golden Gun', 'Moonraker' or 'Octopussy'. The pace is sometimes unnecessarily too slow, Moore does look worn out for the role, but the villains (Christopher Walken and Grace Jones) are truly memorable, and the climactic thrill scenes in San Francisco and the San Fernando Valley are exciting and enjoyable. As an overall movie in the James Bond series, it's in the middle of the pack. Certainly not one of the best, but hardly the worst. It will make for enjoyable viewing for any Bond fan. Roger Moore was wise, however, to make this his last outing."
2,last moore bond movie,I can't put my finger on it but this was terrible. Director or writing but it was way off the standard for Bond
5,Silly Campy Fun ...remember the 80's and NEON,"Wow, I forget how silly we were back then and better yet its a great throwback to what computers USE to look like. Watch it and honestly James Bond kisses must be fabulous because there isn't anything Risque except for the neon."
2,The truth about this Bond,"Okay first the good things about this film. Christopher Walken portrayal as Max Zorin is great. If anyone can play a psycho its him. Roger Moore plays the role with class and style, not his fault the storyline was weak and the producers couldn't get Brosnan or Dalton to fill in, Moore plays Bond great one last time. Now the Bad. First the plot was a really bad spinoff of Goldfinger, both Zorin and Goldfinger portrayed villains obsessed with dominating the global market with their respective loves (computer chips for Zorin and gold for Goldfinger). The destruction of silicone valley and Fort Knox. Skilled Henchpersons, you get the idea. The other really bad element of the movie was the Bond girl (Stacey Sutton, played by Tanya Roberts), even Goodnight in TMWTGG was more capable. Good thing Dalton or Brosnan did not do this film, neither could have saved it. A Bad way for Moore to go out."
3,Weakest of the Roger Moore Bond films,"I love James Bond films and am a big fan of Roger Moore but this is the one Bond film I don't like very much. Reasons? (a) Tanya Roberts can't act (b) Christopher 'Wooden' Walken can't act (c) Duran Duran's songs all sound the same (like crap). Okay I realize that most Bond girls aren't exactly picked for their acting skills but please! Tanya Roberts? Come on, they could have done better than that. Any of the other ex-Charlies Angels would have been better (Jacklyn Smith would have been awesome - but I digress).If you want to complete your Bond collection, by all means get it but I'd say any of the other Roger Moore Bond films are superior to this one ..."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Long-in-the-tooth Roger Moore stars in an uninspired Bond entry that lifts large portions of its plot directly from its (better) predecessors; A View to a Kill has little to offer aside from a catchy theme and an interesting Bond girl in Grace Jones' Mayday
4,1980's BOND VIDEO,"VIEW TO A KILL should have let Roger Moore bow out with class appropriate and fitting to the 007 mode. Instead, it's a high budget MTV video with all the mid-1980's trappings: Duran Duran, Grace Jones, San Francisco. It appears Roger had alot of fun screaching ""stretch"" to Tanya Roberts, maybe he was auditioning for his next career as an aeorbics teacher (remember this is 1985). This one gets saved by Christopher Walken's over the top performance and the double Duran theme song that ranks high in their songbook. Why didn't Simon LeBon have a walk on part?"
5,"May Day, where have you been?","I first encountered this film when I recieved the movie storyboook from this film. I was mesmerized by it, and being only 5 or 6, it really didn't have an impact on me until later when I saw the film on TBS.I had wished that I had watched it earlier, because it is quite a good Bond movie, and it really ends the Moore era with a flourish.The plot revolves around Max Zorin's insane, and yet diablolical plot to flood 'Silicon Valley' and Bond investigates the plan.While Moore was looking old enough to be Tanya Roberts father, his adventerous additude was still there. That is what the best part of the film is about, it's not about him being old, its about him saving the world.This is a good Bond film........"
3,Among the least of the Bonds.,"Needed much less of the preternaturally frightening, oft-G-string-clad Grace Jones, and way more of the gorgeous Tanya Roberts."
3,a view to fun,"I don't know why some hated this bond movie, it's pretty cool;it has action, a great villain (play by Walken)a terrific henchwoman (Grace Jones)and the best actor to play Bond Roger Moore,the only bad things (that's the reason I only gave it 3 star) are: Macknee's character of Tibett was to short, Tanya Roberts is the worst Bond girl since Mary Goodnight (the man with the golden gun)and where was Felix Leither? when Bond came to America his CIA counterpart always whas there to help. But still View is fun to watch, so buy the dvd and enjoy."
2,Really bad,"This is my least favorite Bond out of all the 7 I've seen. It barely even feels like a Bond film at all. The film is about Max Zorin, who wants to make his own microchips, and in order to do so he must destroy the Silicon Valley. Of course, it's 007 to the rescue! Moore by this point was way too old to play Bond, and he kind of walks through it, you know?There are 3 good points in this film. One is the action. Like in every Bond film, even the worst can be held up by good action sequences. Two is Christopher Walken as Max Zorin. Zorin is one of THE best Bond villans. His henchwoman May Day, is one of the worst. Third is the title song by Duran Duran.Avoid it at all costs, except for the great extras on the DVD."
2,Two Stars is generous,"Watching this barely watchable Bond flick again last week I am amused by two scenes.The first is where James Bond and Tanya Roberts escape from the authorities in a stolen fire engine. Then, what is supposed to be the following day, Bond is still driving around in the fire engine.Even more ludicruos is the final scene with the blimp on the Golden Gate Bridge. Here you have a huge zeppelin entangled in the tower of the bridge while traffic below continues on like nothing is happening above."
2,Horrible exit for Roger Moore,"I thought this was supposed to be bond but I thought wrong this flim is boring,silly and weird because the characters suck and they don't fight so stay away from this flim and get gold finger instead. Didn't you know that this is a remake of gold finger and plus the bond girl in here is stupid and all she does in there is just screaming and crying too plus she's not tough. This flim barely even has a plot and there's no good action and villains and come on it even has no gadgets and the places are not even exotic. If you want bond movies with action,adventure,gadgets and exotic places get the living daylights,goldfinger,octopussy and the man with the golden gun because this flim isn't good."
3,This Bond Movie is missing something,"As much as I think Moore made a good Bond this one fails to hit the mark. I get the impression this one has a lower budget than the rest of the ones made in the 1980's. The actress who played Stacy Sutton is a babe, however she cannot act to save her life. She is constantly squeeling and lacks any sort of character. Pam Bouvier in Licence to Kill was one of the best Bond girls in my opinion because she had more intellignce and good looks. I like Max Zorin played by Christopher Walken because he is so insane(a typical Bond adversery). To conclude I was disappointed because this was Moore's final movie and he should have been given a better script and a higher budget."
4,AVTAK puts the series back on track,"After 1977's TSWLM the Bond series fell into a hole for a number of years. 79's M was plain awful, 81's FYEO was bland and forgettable (great stunts, dull villains), and although 83's O was good it was largely outshone by Connery in NSNA. The Bond series needed something and AVTAK gave it the adrenalin shot required. This entry contains great action sequences, an enjoyable plot and most importantly, a group of villains (a psychotic Zorin, MayDay the Shemale, and a Nutty Nazi Doc.) that would probably rank as amongst the best of the series (definitely the best of the 80's - the only other contenders being from 89's LTK). The only negative is an ageing Moore who yet again sleepwalks in the lead role (this annoying habit worsened from Moonraker onward). Despite this, AVTAK is a great flick and paved the way for solid entries in which Dalton and Brosnan gave a touch of class to the lead role (despite the 20-year-old series formula remaining the same)."
3,Could only give it 3 stars,"At this point in 1985, Moore was pushing 58 at the time. He looked so old that he could be Tanya Roberts father or grandfather at this point. Moore was not as whitty as he usually is in his earlier films. Even Lois Maxwell just looked to old to play Moneypenny. She looked good during the Connery years, but she sould have quit in the mid 70s after The Man With the Golden Gun. The action is pretty good and all of the locations were ok. I think when they try to make a Bond Film in the US, it just doesn't have the right touch. Goldfinger was the best film done in the US, it had taste and style. The villians however was excellent with Grace Jones and Christopher Walken. I am glad the Moore decided to quit and did not continue on. Moreover, still lacked that Ian Fleming touch!!"
2,What happened to you 007?,"A View To A Kill has to be the lowpoint of the series. It's a shame that a good theme song was wasted on this trite film. How can you make a classic Bond film like Octopussy, and then make this? It's just a basic retread of Goldfinger. This ranks up there with Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, Goldeneye, and Tomorrow Never Dies as the worst of the series. Christopher Walken is way over the top. Tanya Roberts couldn't act her way out of a paper-bag. Bond films are supposed to be made like From Russia With Love, For Your Eyes Only, and the Living Daylights. Those are films with intelligent plots, realistic villians, and great action. Shame on Roger Moore for agreeing to be in this. Thank god the series got a second wind with The Living Daylights."
4,"I Hate Roger Moore, But This Movie Is Great Fun","Well as many people were glad to hear this is the last Bond movie starring Roger Moore, and it was deffinitly time for this relic to throw in the towel. That being said I think this movie is great fun, even though it does have a lot of stupid things in it. The highlights for me were of course The God, Christopher Walken, playing the insane Zorin. He is probably my favorite out of any Bond villian in the series because he just seemed to have a fun time with his job. The girl who now plays Midge in that seventies show, was a lot more funny then sexy, but I had great gun watching her, because her performance was much to comical to take at all seriously. Well that's about all for this movie. Check it out.THE GREAT ETNEBOB HAS SPOKEN"
2,Geriatric Bond,"Roger looks pretty old and worn out in this one (so is the plot). A couple of nice action scenes. Walken is okay as the bad guy but the script really limits him, and Tanya Roberts is badly in need of some acting lessons. She is simply awful."
4,Dance Into The *Bond* fire!,"Good movie. Sadly, Roger Morre's last 007 movie. Oh well. This movie has A LOT of action. Some people don't like the chase seen in this movie when James hangs from the lader. I think it's cool. The story is this guy, Mr.Zorin wants to rule the world(well what else!) Not also that, he wants to make an earthquake! Bond must stop him. The DVD features 3 traliers,3 tv stops, a documentry of the movie and about the James Bond Songs from 1962-1999, and a music video of Duran Duran. 007 fans, this is a must see. Get it on VHS or DVD today!"
4,A View to a Kill,"I had a reaction similar to gottlibschaller. I also liked the movie without any particular compelling reason to. Maybe because Silicon Valley is more or less close to home. When Moore did ""For Your Eyes Only,"" it was Greece and Switzerland and he and Carole Buquet were trying to get some junk from the bottom of the sea. In contrast, the Silicon Valley... now that's something worth protecting and fighting for. The view of the Golden Gate bridge and the SF bay is... see the title. The stunts are good. And Grace Jones' character is a victim of love and international intrigue. So what else do you need? Perhaps a somewhat younger James Bond."
5,A View to a Kill,"I thought""A View to a Kill"" was action packed and it kept my intrest to the end. The plot was great, the villins were sinister,and most of all: it was Roger Moore's last outing as Bond...James Bond! let me be one of the few that think Moore further secured his place in the Bond files! Even I know that This was NOT Moore's best performance but, with Walken putting on a splendid show, ""A View to a Kill"" is a classic among Bond films. I don't see why this film takes so much heat. If you look at ""Live and Let Die"" (Moore's best outing) he had the same suspect acting (the fight in the alley in Harlem) that he had in this film. Moore was always the Bond that needed his stunt-men and extra's most! With that in mind, I thought for his age, the great screen-play by Walken(like always) and a solid performance by Grace Jones, add the best sound track of all the Bond films, ""A View to a Kill"" is one of the greatest Bond films of all time!"
3,A View to an okay Bond movie,"A View to a Kill was okay. But they despretly needed to retire the 58 (!) year old Rodger Moore. He limped when he ran, which is definitly a sign to retire. The girl stunck. Christopher Walken played a buck-toothed villian,he was good though but it was his right-hand man... no woman Mayday who took the spot as villian. She was the Oddjob or Jaws of the movie. A good end to Rodger Moore's career as Bond, James Bond though."
1,Don't bother with this one,"What a disappointment! This toy purports to have multiple levels and games, but it's way too simplistic for kids at the older end of the recommended range. Whether it's following a sequence of lights or matching the colored fireflies (i.e. pressing the unlit red firefly if the other red firefly is currently lit) this is way too repetitious for even unsophisticated 4 year olds. And what's worse, the buttons are temperamental so sometimes they don't register a ""hit"" even when the correct firefly has been pressed. 2 or even 3 year olds might find this amusing, but forget it for older kids."
4,"Good toy, good value.","Bought this a long time ago when my daughter was little. It is a fun game for toddlers and also helps develop motor skills, I think. It is durable, we still have it after all this time. The only thing I didn't like about it is the volume could be a bit louder, it was hard to hear in the car."
3,"Nicely, laid out book","This book was nice and calming. I was in search for something to help me calm down my body and to get my core into alinement, but after going to some classes realized that it is all in my brain and controlling what I'm thinking is most of the battle."
5,Your Hands Can Heal,"In 1992 my dear friend Jill acquired a blood disorder which left her legally blind. From '92-'96 she endured nine laser surgeries, blood thinners, steroids...nothing changed. She met Master Co, he used the techniques, The same ones in 'Your Hands Can Heal', and in 45 minutes her vision returned and the blood disorder disappeared. This is medically documented. 'Your Hands Can Heal' is a Priceless manual that I hope will empower all to a place of preventative rather than curative measures.These Techniques Have Changed My Life.Master Co, Dr.Robins, I bow to You in admiration for the Gift You have given us."
5,Great book,I just got this book since I'm on a path of healing. And looking forward to reading more about it.
5,You Hands Can Heal You,I loved this book so much I bought it twice! I had lent it out and it never returned and this is a book you can read over and over again as well it is good to have for reference. I had the pleasure of meeting Master Stephen Co and he is an incredible gentleman.
5,Jerry's review,Life transforming is all I can say. Started using the information provided in the book and WOW.Immediate results. I recommend this book to anyone interested in helping them selves or loved ones with any physical malady.
2,Why no gift card?,"This item was ordered well in advance of Christmas. Why no gift card with $5.00 gift certificate prior to receipt of magazine? I realize that the magazine subscription would take weeks, but surely an acknowledgement could have been sent for Xmas stocking."
1,Too thick like Huge Catalog or phone book,"This magazine is full of the company's advertisement. The magazine is too thick and like phone book. unless reader is interested to go thru all the company's catalog, this is perfect for them. The only reason i am subscribe this magazine is their free gift. After all, their free gift is not so good after all, and one time they did not send my free gift. I can't wait to end my subscription. I subscribe this magazine for 2 times, and every time was hoping to read something more ""educational"". But, I am disappointed."
1,Dissatisfied Customer,I ordered this product on 02/06/07. Today is 03/09/07 - more than a month. I have not received this product. HOw can you even ask me to rate this. And HOW LONG DOES IT FREAKIN TAKE TO START A MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION?
4,very good considering price..:D,"despite what many people say about Amazon's magazine subscriptions, I like amazon's. It arrived a month later I ordered just like most magazine subscriptions. I was a bit annoyed by the fact that the magazine wasn't covered/packed with plastic bag or something like that (National geography alwasys puts their little magazine in the plastic bag! :D). but other than that no problem at all! and magazine itself is good..."
2,All Reputation,"First, let me say that I love getting my magazines from amazon. They're easy and cheapter and there's no constant mail begging to renew at a (higher) rate. That said, I get Elle and Bazaar ($10 each) but forget Vogue. It used to be good-models, clothes, fashion, cutting edge-and I subscribed for years. Now it's celeb fluff or (the worst) some socialite with too much money complaining about how her ballgowns won't fit in her closet and that she picks the kids up from school and not the nanny. Honestly, I'm all about Carine Roitfeld and blame Anna Wintour. Roitfeld has style and Wintour lost it years ago. I miss the old Vogue but cannot reltate to this crap. When I like the ads better than the articles, there's a problem. So I stick with Bazaar, which has better fashion coverage, and Elle, which has articles that are interesting and I can relate to and scrap Vogue."
2,Too long to download on Kindle HD,"I like the magazine, but not the Kindle HD version. I already had a subscription so I decided to try the Kindle HD version , I kid you not it's been downloading for the last three hours! I'm glad I tried it before ordering the O magazine which is also a larger content magazine. If you have a lot of time for a download and battery recharge go for it, if not it's a bust."
4,Good stuff,"Always some nice photo shoots, though they tend to go back to grungy a bit often for my taste these days."
2,Downhill since they decided to put celebrities on the cover,"Vogue self proclaims to be the fashion authority but alas it no longer is the case. Articles are insipid and tabloid gossip has taken over. If you truly want to see fashion, buy the French Vogue or better yet, ""Numero"". In the US, I now read Harper's Bazaar."
1,Boring Boring Vogue,"This magazine is insipid and even worse it just keeps coming. I ordered a one year subscription and it has been arriving like clockwork for years. Apparently once they have your credit card number they renew it without permission.The ""free gift"" with the subscription should have been a warning of how sophisticated Vogue actually is. The tote arrived, dirty and wadded up in a much too small plastic bag. I threw it out... now to get off the Vogue hook as well."
2,Boring!,"Yes, I'm a fashionista & this is supposedly the bible of the fashion industry! However, I find this magazine to be really dull. It has too many pages, too many advertisements & they show nothing but the most expensive designer clothes worn by the usual anorexic stick figure models who really need to eat! The articles are also very boring. They write about alot of really rich sociallites & high-society lifestyles. There's really nothing in this magazine I can use that relates to me. You'd have to be Paris Hilton to be entertained by this publication. If I want a great fashion magazine, I get ELLE because at least the clothing they show is a liitle more affordable & they have some great articles!"
2,This is not Vogue,"This is definitely not the Vogue, as we know it. As a matter of fact, the american Vogue is one overestimated pound of paper full of ads, a little bit of fashion in between, and some socialite news. And I mean FULL of ads, page after page! I can't help but wonder what's next?? Coupons??? This is just a pathetic exploitation of the name of Vogue.If you want to read the real Vogue, go for the Vogue Paris - such a huge difference in quality!"
1,zero stars sounds right torn cover looked like garbage,"If you want a vogue subscription I suggest going to the Vogue website and ordering from them. My magazine arrived with a torn cover, warped pages, and basically looked like garbage. Fine. Things happen during shipping and I understand that. I've sent them a polite request for another unblemished copy and have yet to receive a response. Upon receipt of a pristine copy of the October 2011 issue, I will happily delete this review. Until then, I recommend not buying from this seller."
5,Excellent!,"Vogue is a great value! Whether you are on the cutting edge of fashion or not, it's a great resource for trendy ideas."
3,NYgirl,"My order was placed July 13th....I rcv'd the ""July"" issue a couple of days ago.....so I wonder if I'll get the August issue-b/c it's already 8/19/10.....and I only got the July issue. I was thinking my 1st issue would be the Sept. issue since it can take 6-10 weeks for the 1st issue to arrive. The first issue usually comes in a plastic cover.....mine didn't have one so I guess they stopped the plastic covers! I called vogue CS-they can't send me the Aug. issue...and they don't know if I'm going to get it-so they just extended my sub. 2 months."
1,sent me an OLD ISSUE! I received the May issue on June 21st!,"I intend to call and complain! I should have received the July issue and yet, I was sent the May issue on June 21st as my 1st issue. I cannot believe they get away with such an insult. Hopefully, it will not be too involved to get them to make it right!"
2,Delivery is soooo slow,"I ordered the Vogue on 7/17, and today is 8/29, I still haven't received it. I ordered two magazines at the same time, got another one one week ago."
3,A good magazine but not like it used to be,"Gosh how I yearn for the days when supermodels were splashed on the cover of ""Vogue"" magazine. I dont think I have an issue from within the past few years that a real model (and I dont mean Kate Hudson, Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Aniston) has graced the covers for at least two consecutive months. I suppose this is Hollywood's answer to models becoming actresses that now the actresses are becoming models. Sorry but even though I think Nicole Kidman is a wonderful actress with a model figure, give me Gisele or Karolina any day of the week."
1,sucks!,This magazine is filled with ads and the articles are rarely very interesting (unless you make millions). Not worth my precious time!
1,why?,i only received 2 issues!!!(Oct and April) I thought I am going to have an issue for each month...it is nonsense for me...am i misunderstanding the meaning of 1-yr renewal?
2,Not my cup of tea...,This magazine is filled with ads and the articles are rarely very interesting (unless you make millions). Not worth my precious time!
2,June`s issue on July 10th?,"First copy came on July 10th, a month after I subscribed. But why was it June`s issue? I did not subscribe for outdated copies of the magazine..."
1,Monthly trash finally stopped,I subscribed this VOGUE for 1 year and I doubted the quality of this US edition magazine. There was barely nothing in the magazine but advertisements. It seems a little bit attractive when you see the cover but nobody can not ever find a real thing in the magazine. 90% of the content are ad. and the US VOGUE has no taste at all! It is absolutely trash when it compares with Italian VOGUE even Chinese VOGUE. I have read all the 12 issues and did not see any improvement/change. Stop reading it might be a wise choice. I am glad now it is finally stopped delivering.
3,Tired of celebrities on the cover,I've had a Vogue subscription for at least 10 years but will not be renewing my subscription. I'm tired of seeing celebrities on the cover-if I was interested in them I would subscribe to People or InStyle magazine. The magazine has become much more celebrity-focused over the years instead of being fashion-focused. There's plenty of celebrity content to be found in mags and on the web. No thanks.
2,Vogue Paris -- Paris free,"If you're into fashion, but prefer getting it without a daily dose of whats happening in the lives of nyc socialities, then opt for Vogue Paris. Its in french of course, but who 'reads' vogue. Its also much pricer ($15), but if i wanted to see what Paris Hilton was doing, I'd buy YM. Shockingly enough, Vogue Paris is actually about fashion, not about what fashionable celebrities are wearing."
1,a noticeable drop in quality over the years,"This month's issue of Vogue (July 2008, with Nicole Kidman on the cover) clarified for me the significant drop in quality at American Vogue over the years. The magazine has reduced in size, now smaller than US letter paper. The spine measures less than 1/4 inch. The printing and paper quality are low. The content of the July issue, in particular was watery. Vogue used to contain expansive descriptions of trends and details, but if the last few issues are an indicator, they must have fired a lot of writers. What exists now is not much more than product placement ads. The photo pages are few in number as well. I know that there is much more to fashion now that what was in Vogue lately. What's going on? Maybe there needs to be a change in editorial leadership. In the meanwhile, sadly I probably won't renew."
2,"Ads, ads and more ads","Vogue is full of ads. I pick this magazine up and I don't start getting to the articles until I am a fourth through the thing. I find the articles quite boring and not informative at all. One good thing about Vogue is the photos are pretty artistic and you get an idea of how fashion is art, but that is about all I get out of it. So, if you like advertisments this mag is for you."
1,Definitely not what I expected!,"So I usually get magazines through the mail (old-fashioned way) and overall I had gotten great results. I believed that if I got a magazine subscription through internet it would be easier and faster. Was I wrong! First of all it took almost 2 months to get the first magazine, and when I did I got a 2 month old magazine, and up to now I have yet to receive the august issue which came out to stores almost three weeks ago. I definitely DO NOT recommend getting magazine subscriptions through anywhere else besides the ancient, yet effective way of mail."
1,Terrible,"I waited two month and didn't get a single issue. Customer service is terrible. When I contacted them several times, no one replied. Don't count on Amazon either. My complaints got no response at all. The most ridiculous thing is when I try to cancel it, they only give me half my money back. But I didn't even get one!!! I will never use this company again. Nor will I ever subscribe magazine from Amazon anymore. Just terrible experience."
2,Never had the chance to use it...,I'm sure this is what I wanted... so I ordered one... the `supplier' sent me one that was cracked. I returned it and got another... is was cracked as well... well... 3rd times a charm... right??...The third one was broken into sections.If could have gotten one that was in one piece... I'm sure I'd be `delighted'... as it is ... that's not the first rating term that comes to mind.I'm still looking for a non-plastic ruler... (or someone that is smart enough to package a plastic ruler adequately).
3,Probably Awesome,"I ordered these because I wanted pants that fell from the knee done, nothing that hugged my calves. I bought them and they were way to relaxed so I sent them back. I ordred some other ones that were a different fit thinking they were what I was looking for. I washed them and they shrunk TONS, and they hug my calves and are 2 inches to short! So I will be buying these again and washing them and since Fit Coutour seems to shrink TONS I will just wash them and they should be fab!"
5,Great ideas,Her descriptions and views of gardens are a delight. Insightful thoughts on deciding where to spotlight important garden accessories.
5,Garden View.,"If I had to pick my favorite Americans books on garden design, and I do have many, it would be all of Tara Dillard's. Right up there with Christopher Lloyd."
5,Beautiful Plant !,"I bought this a week ago and I instantly loved it. It makes my living room look more homely, would definitely recommend it"
2,Lady Killer,Very OUTDATED material - Poorly writter - Amatuerish1 WOOD NOT RECOMMEND THIS AUTHOR! I've tried to read several other of his books & they're all the same. Like writted by a grade school kid in the 1950's.
3,Not one of the better ones,"Race against a killer. Except for one scene lacks punch. Yet, well written and a fast read. In that regard typical of the series."
3,Outdated Nostalgic Series,"I picked up several of the Ed McBain series because I like to read about familiar characters and series provide them as does this one. I thought it'd be fun to look back on the good old days of crime solving and this series does that too. If anyone wants complete enjoyment of this series, however, I think they must forget all the advanced tools available to investigators on TV and in the movies and concentrate on the stories, not the techniques. It is the only way to fully appreciate McBain's 87th precinct."
5,Tom's Mom,"My family loves playing this game! Until now, I had never thought of Monopoly as being educational; but my six year old son's ability to add in his head has improved tremendously. I grew up playing the original Monopoly. The new 3-D game board is ingenious. When the board gets bumped the pieces don't shift all over the place. It's a must have for Monopoly fans whether you're Star Wars fans or not! I have no doubt that my family will continue to enjoy this improved version of the game for years to come. A classic made even better!"
5,Great product for fussy eaters,"Our Son who is a VERY difficult eater loves the mighty milk. My wife and I had looked at other so called ""nutritional"" drinks for children and found that they have over four times the added sugar compared to the mighty milk. We mix it with lofat milk on a 1 to 1 ratio and its great to see our fussy eater actually ask for his chocolate milk."
4,Easy to use and steams food well...,"I got this as a gift. I have been steaming just about everything...chicken, veggies, fruits. I am even making my infant daughters baby food with it! So far, I have not screwed up anything in the steamer (which I apparently do when cooking quite often). The only complaint I have is that there is not an easier way to remove the lid to get the food. If there is still steam in there, you have to be VERY careful when removing the lid so as not to burn yourself. You have to wear potholders. It would be nice if it had some sort of handle on top or something like that. Other than that, perfect! And very reasonably priced."
2,Disappointed,"Having had one of the old style models for probably 12 years, it sadly just quit working. I missed it so much but could only find it on line. When I received this I was very disappointed in how flimsy it is and the redesign which made things a little more difficult to use. Not sure why they messed with a good thing. Works okay but I don't see this product lasting long."
2,not what I expected,I have to return this item. The containers are too small to cook enough portions for a four person family and the cooking time is too long. A pressure cooker with an average steamer rack and a fitting container does the same type of cooking in half the time.
1,DONT BUY!!,"This unit has been a sad disappointment.Seems the Rival company doesnt pay people to TEST the product before selling to the public!!This thing DOES NOT WORK!!Shuts off after one minute no matter HOW much time you put on it.Rival will NOT replace it...yet they offer you 10% discount to buy another CRAP quality product!!Black and decker or other brand worked for us for over 10 yrs ....still does...the basket we destroyed over so many years and cracked it in so many places we thought a replacement was overdue...turns out, shoulda kept the unsightly one ..at least it worked!!"
5,Invaluable for anyone who has a piano,"Clyde and Wendy Watson have done it again! This time they have taken jingles from Father Fox's Pennyrhymes and Catch Me & Kiss Me & Say it again and set them to music for pianos and guitars. Clyde was a musician for a while, so that's one reason why she set her poetry to music. These songs like the poems go well with the beautiful illustrations by Wendy. Father Fox's Pennyrhymes and Catch Me and Kiss Me and Say it again were my son Robert's favorite books to buy for people who were having babies. We are shocked that both those books, umlike the songbook, are out of print. We hope that the publishing company will start making and selling them again!"
5,Great Book!,Love this book!! It is packed full of amazing untold stories about the horses we love. Definitely a must read for people of all ages
4,Beautiful ribbon,"This ribbon was very pretty, a little lighter brown than I expected but it still worked great with the wrapping paper I used."
4,Brick a World History,"This is an amazing book, if you happen to be interested in Bricks, which the recipient certainly was.However, having just paid over 30 for the book, secondhand, I was disappointed to pass it on to the Birthday Boy in it's postage parcel, for him to find the cover was torn,and worse, it had on it a price sticker on it saying 95p! Mortifying. Guess whoever sold it to me bought it from a car boot sale, or charity shop - all I can say is, well done for spotting a bargain!"
3,"Intense and passionate, but flawed","I don't understand the reviews that complain about a lack of passion, because I found this book incredibly intense, so much so that I forgot that it was fiction. I guess these days everything has to be spelled out, whereas this writer, by mere suggestion, conjures up a whole world, including a world of emotion. The book is flawed, however, by a sense that the author could have told us so much more (however subtly), and by an unsatisfying ending. Perhaps not knowing how to conclude, the author wraps it up with cliches along the lines of ""Nothing would ever be the same."""
2,"Starts out well, then languishes","I enjoyed the first hundred pages of this book, as Daisy, a 20 year old English girl, tries to find her way in the world. But after she marries and moves to Ireland, the book starts to drag. The characters she meets there are never fully fleshed out, so their eccentricities seem incomprehensible.I skimmed the second half.I recommend The Dower House, also by Annabel David Goff, instead of this book."
2,Spanish Edition but NOT SPANISH,"I purchase Spanish Books and not all Spanish books have a Spanish title. Clearly this product is presented as a ""Spanish Edition"" and yet it isn't."
2,meh,"i dont think it was worth the $20 i paid for it. I was under the impression it was more about kiefer than the band he was promoting, so i was wrong there."
5,Never would have heard of the band if I hadn't seen this....,"I actually picked this DVD up at the local video store. I saw Keifer on the cover and being the 24 fan that I am I read the description on the back of the DVD and thought ""Why not"", so I rented it. I was impressed by this documentary. I thought it was cool seeing Keifer drunk; he's hilarious. If there was one person in the world I would like to spend the day with, it would be him. But, the main attraction in my oppinion is definitely Rocco Deluca & The Burden. I love their southern fried sound! I probably never would have heard of them if I hadn't taken a chance on this DVD. I love Rocco's unique voice. The band member's are great at what they do. I eventually bought this DVD because I liked it so much. I would love to see them live. Overall I definitely believe this is worth 5 stars."
4,Great if you love Kiefer,"This movie was a fun and intimate look at Keifer Sutherland's music label's first band: Rocco DeLucca and the Burden as they toured Europe for the first time. It was a lot of fun to watch, and the music was great."
4,INSIGHTFUL,"This commentary is one of my most useful resources. It's not necessary to go to seminary in order to understand MacArthur's insight. He presents the information clearly and does a good job of explaining how he arrived at a particular interpretation. He's especially thorough in explaining how the subject of discussion relates to other passages in scripture. He traces many of the key words back to the original Greek and explains their meanings. And he touches on some of the history as well. He does occasionally launch into a sermon which can get away from the main point of the verse. And sometimes I think he overlooks, skips, or misses some of the points that should be mentioned. However, this is still a good and valuable resource for anyone doing a deep study of the book."
5,The wisdom of a true genius expressed in simple characters,"After looking through this book, I regret that it has been some time since I read a collection of Peanuts cartoons. The simple wisdom and reality of life reflected in the cartoons is something that should not be forgotten. All human emotions from joy to despair are expressed in the characters in the Peanuts strip and even current events manage to appear.In this book, Snoopy is invited to lecture at ""The Daisy Hill Puppy Farm."" While he is there, a riot breaks out over dogs being sent over to Vietnam and not coming back. My favorite is when Linus is standing in a snowstorm and he sticks out his tongue to catch a snowflake. After it lands he utters, ""Bleah! Polluted snowflakes!""Charles Schulz was a true genius at representing the human condition, using simple characters to describe complex problems. While he was never directly able to solve any of the world's problems in his strip, reading it made them easier to bear."
3,A little High Toned,I'm a native Texan and love to read about anything Texas. I had a subscription the this mag years ago and found it a little high-toned for my tastes then. i thought now that I had aged 30 or so years I would have found it more relevant.I own a small ranch in the Hill Country and I'm no hick but it still seems this mag is directed more towards the Haughty Downtown Dallas type than your average Texan actually would be. Still just a little too snooty for me.
2,Texas Monthly review,No better than it was years ago when I quit subscribing.Too many ads and not enough articles of interest.Still pretty poor.
1,Watch out for back issues!,"Price is great, but...Instead of the most current issue arriving first, I received back issues more than 2 months after they hit the news stands. If this counts towards my 12 issues, I will not renew."
1,Never delivered,"Four months after sale and still not the first issue. My subscription must be in limbo-land,"
3,Good Magazine,"Good magazine, with lots of interesting info and trivia on various places in Texas, and the way of life there."
1,I do not like this magazine,I don't like Texas Monthly. Never have. Some people want it just 'cause it's about Texas but it's not worth it. Read somebody else's copy.
1,Texas Monthly magazine,I have still not received even the 1st copy. I ordered & paid for it several weeks ago.
3,Tons of ads.,I'm only on my first issue of Texas Monthly and it has some good articles however the magazine is loaded with a ton of ads. I will let you know more when I recieve more issues of the magazine.
5,"Great Magazine, even for those non-native Texans","First, I am not a native Texan. I have lived in Texas and enjoyed my time there. Even before I moved to the Lone Star State, friends from Texas introduced me to Texas Monthly. I found the articles well-written, insightful, and fun to read. They provide a different perspective into social, political and environmental issues that are relevant far beyond the Texas borders.The restaurant reviews are spot on and always truthful. I used them as guide in many Texas cities and it never steered me wrong. I especially like when a review is updated and recommends specific dishes. The recipes are easy to make and mouth-watering.The cultural reviews make it easy to plan trips across the state and always see something new.Bottom line: Even though I don't live in Texas anymore, I will continue subscribing to Texas Monthly and giving it as a gift for many years."
2,The Sad Decline of a Once Great Magazine,"I remember growing up in the Spring Branch neighborhood of Houston and reading Texas Monthly in the 1970's. It was an enjoyable read about far off places like El Paso, Amarillo and Brownsville as well as a source of information as to the working of my own hometown. Sadly, this once proud publication has become a mouthpiece for the ""limousine liberal"" set. Out of 275 pages, 100 are dedicated to boutiques in the Dallas and Houston Galleria areas, 75 are for advetisements for plastic surgeons and/or attorneys, 40 are for bashing Conservatives, 35 are for what people from the Northeast want to pretend Texas is about and 25 are actually well written, thought provoking articles. The magazine has gone from a celebration of our state to a source of contempt of everything that made Texas what it is."
2,Going down hill.,"I have subscribed to this magazine off and on for the last 15 years. This magazine is known for the meticulously researched articles on Texas history and local figures. However, it seems that the better quality pieces have become fewer and more far between over recent years. I don't know if the magazine went through a change in ownership or what happened. They still have the occasional jewel but you have to wade through a ton of fluff."
3,Too many advertisements!,"Not a bad magazine. Great articles, photos and recipes from time to time. The biggest down fall is that 65% of the content is advertisements. For a buck an issue, not bad."
5,Great Magazine,I enjoy subscribing to Texas Monthly to see what is going on in other parts of the state and reading articles about people from Texas and events in Texas.
1,Nothing received,I am not sure why you sent me an email requesting a review of this subscription purchase. I have received nothing since I placed my order and have received no communications regarding the order status.This is very poor.-Roland Luce
1,have not received to review,"WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW, BUT FIRST ISSUE HASN'T REACHED MY DOORSTEP YET..IF I DO NOT RECEIVE IT SOON, I WILL REQUEST CREDIT TO CHARGED AM0UNT ON MY CARD..NOT VERY HAPPY WITH YOUR PROCESS AT THIS POINT..REGARDS..GREGORY FUTRELL"
1,Still haven't received a magazine,"Haven't received an issue yet, it has been 2 months since I purchased. I purchased last year also and never received anything. Guess I'm stupid for trying again but I like the magazine."
1,They cheat you out of a full year subscription,"They do not send you a full year subscription. They sent me 2 issues, December 2008 and January 2009, that were already on the newsstands as my first issue and then wrote on my mailing label that my subscription ends in November 2009. That probably means it end in October 2009. Not fair."
4,"About Texans, for Texans","The essential monthly reader for people enamored with all things Texas. Although the advertisers are a bit on the elite side, the articles hit home with the rest of us. The entertainment guide is indispensable."
1,TM *not* the authority on Texas & Texans,"Texas Monthly is NOT the authority on things and people Texan. Of course, we understand they consider themselves such, but as the majority of Texans know, TM does not speak for the everyday, hard-working, Texan. Quite the opposite, the people who write for TM speak for the liberals in Austin who consider themselves elite and much more intelligent than the average Texan. These Austin-ites are laughed at by the rest of the state. Texas is a great state, however; in spite of TM, who denigrate Texans who refuse to walk their narrow, liberal-line walk."
2,Not the same magazine anymore.,I canceled my subscription because of theincreasingly liberal articles. It wasn't amagazine I'd leave around for my early-teensto read.
1,I WANT TO RECEIVE THE MAGAZINE,I would love to RECEIVE the item before I review it. I have yet to receive a magazine. Apparently you people want me to be nasty so I will. Either send the freaking magazine or give me my damned money back.
3,So-so value,"Too many ads. Too many ""Best restaurents, doctors, lawyers, etc."" listings. Maybe one or two good articles per issue. Probably won't subscribe again."
3,"Patchy, but with good stuff","I am a long time Pogues fan and very wary of getting any ""solo"" Pogues or Shane effort. But I found an old copy of ""The Snake,"" the 1994 release in a used bin and based on the reviews here, decided to take a chance. I come away with mixed feelings about it. I expected to hear more Irish tinged rock, which there is on this album, but the first tune was a basic straight ahead hard rocking tune. I immediately thought I made a big mistake. But on relistens, the regular rock songs have some redeeming value and the Irish songs are very good, what I expected. I programmed out some songs on my CD player, and turned it into a solid CD. But straight through, there are definitely some songs I could do without."
5,Simply one of the best CD's I Own!,"Shane picks up where the ""good Pogues"" left off and dosn't miss a beat this CD is a MUST OWN for anyone who is a Pogues/Shane McGowen fan."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"This Release is almost great. It has some classics like nancy whisky, song with no name, and the snake. It is quite inconsistant, however. Many people did not like the later pogues which tended to experiment with other types of music that werent irish sounding. This is the same, except i enjoyed when the pogues did it more."
5,Shane does his bit for Mother/Daughter relationships,"Or as I like to call it, ""The fourth great Pogues album"". This is such a strong record, it defiantly deserves to rank alongside Pogue albums such as ""Rum, Sodomy.."" & ""If I should Fall.."".The album continues the Irish-folk flavour, but wish a hard rock feel on some of the tracks.Unfortunately this was the last great MacGowan work (at the time of writing), he did release a follow up ""Crock of Gold"" several years later, but it made for pretty depressing listening.So I suggest you stick to this mini-masterpiece & enjoy Shane at his creative peak."
4,"Don't go, Shane!","This is rowdy fun eh! I can't believe I'm submitting the first review of this album - almost nine years after it hit the shelves. GD - f -in' amazing - I've been listening to it for almost a decade, and y'all should have been, too.If you liked the Pogues ""If I Should Fall From Grace With God"" (or if you ever heard it, even), then you'll like this'n. It's witty & spirited - a *little* rougher, but also more rocking. Shane MacGowan shines on, that crazy emerald! It's like your favourite bar band at their best & rowdiest on their third set on March Seventeenth.Every song is *at least* good - 88% are GREAT+! Oh, don't listen if you're a Republicrat or Demoblican - Shane ROCKS!"
3,Last album that shows off his talent before it faded into a drunken stupor,"I would of loved the album but he should of not sang those 2 songs with that nun (their voices don't go together) - oh and should of left out ""American funeral in Paris"" - terrible. Those are the reasons why I gave it three stars. the rest of the album was great. The Pogues and Shane needed each other to make great music. Too bad it couldn't of worked out longer."
2,Incorrectly titled,"Sorry to say this book was not at all what I was looking for. The title ""Mrs. Fixit Easy Home Repair"" let me to believe that it would provide instructions and tips on routine home maintenance chores. It provides very little of that, but too much other stuff that is not home maintenance, e.g., things like how to improve storage space, cleaning tips and hints, etc. Its a pretty slim volume and there are no detailed instructions for the precious few items that are related to home maintenance and repair, and no diagrams or illustrations. Not badly written but nonetheless, not appropriately titled, and a big disappointment."
2,The Other Side,"... This a book designed for BEGINNERS. Having read other fix-it and frugal books, this was too simple to meet my needs. Only 4 suggestions are offered for each topic, but of course each project requires different numbers of instructions. The most annoying thing to me was faulty proof reading. I wanted to fix my toilet's working mechanism and the index said it was on XXX page, but the topic wasn't even in the book!"
5,Buy It ! It's Just that Simple !,"This book is a MUST for every household!Full of time saving , back to basics, simple fix-its that even a novice 'fix-it 'like myself can perform with ease when following the clear cut directions laid out by Mrs. Fixit.With dozens of easy to read, simple to follow ""fix-its"" for the entire house using items that you actually already have on your shelves to make your life ""just that simple""-er!With out a doubt this book is the perfect Christmas gift for every adult on your list!"
4,No Joke,"Our daughter & son-in-law just purchased their first home & have been busy with painting and typical home owner repairs. I purchased the book as a gag gift for them - however, they refer to this book all the time for remedies and they work!! I would recommend this book to anyone who owns a house - a lot of the information is very basic and well defined and will save you $$$ money in the long run."
3,"The definative ""I'm not in Vermont"" magazine","Currently living in Seattle, I was born and raised in Vermont, and find Vermont Life to be one of the magazines I pick up when I'm feeling homesick. Produced to appeal to the tourist, it concentrates mostly on the touristy side of Vermont - ski areas, panoramic foliage, maple syrup, and Farmer's Markets feature prominently on its pages. Despite that, its like a nice slab of apple pie with sharp Cabot chedder on the side - a piece of home every month."
4,youngblood review,"i got this for a friend if my wife's-she is very happy with it,i believe it is a gift for x-mas, she was happy i got it so quickly"
4,Predictable but good,"Given that there are now only 3 hockey movies; Slapshot, Youngblood and Mystery, Alaska, I think this is still worth watching. The soundtrack for it is bitchin' and the action footage is pretty good. I do agree that the plot is predictable, but hey it is still a HOCKEY MOVIE! ;-)"
4,Dean Cain-Rob's inspiration,"Hockey fans don't have many movies to call their own - it's simply not as glamorous or all-american a sport as baseball or football. This screenplay is a basic formulaic story with interesting trivia attached to it. Rob Lowe stars as Youngblood and he took his inspiration (he says) for the portrayal of his committed athlete character from a guy he went to high school with - DEAN CAIN. Cain, as fans of this ""Superman"" know, was committed to high school football, made all-American at Princeton, then went on to be a rookie with Buffalo Bills. This background makes for a guilty pleasure you don't always get from a sports film, or any film for that matter."
3,Yougblood?,I saw the movie several years ago. I have had the pleasure to skate with George Finn. He actually ref'ed in our adult league in upstate NY. He is a great guy.I thought that the movie was worth seeing as it depicted the area and settings of junior hockey quite well.
4,Classic,"For my money, the best old school movie about hockey. Classic one liners like ""The only thing better than a glass of beer is tea with miss mcgill"" and ""Thank god there is still a sport for middle-sized white boys."" Funny to see Rob Lowe, Swayze, and Keanu in a cheesy hockey movie. I only wish it was available on Blu-ray."
3,Entertaining Junior Hockey Movie,"Not the greatest hockey movie ever made, but for the mid-80s it does a decent job. Good mix of comedy and drama and definitely can't argue with the cast."
4,Predictable but good !,"The movie may be predictable, but they could have not picked a better cast to be a guide for young adults in showing them that taking a change in life while your young is OK. Do things you desire while you have the time to do it. Don't be affraid to get out and explore life befor it is too late!"
3,"Good knife, but the quality control is not what it used to be.","I have owned one of these knives for about 5 years. It's been dependable, tough, and easy to use.I decided to order another one to have as an extra.The newer model immediately felt much cheaper, and the construction quality is noticeably worse than the older model.After putting the new blade together the back end of the knife will not fully snap together and remains loose. It's still usable, but there is a noticeable clicking sound and slight movement whenever any pressure is put on the handle. The quality control in the new cheap Chinese manufacturing plants are clearly not up to snuff.I love my old X-Acto SureGrip, but the quality of the new blades of this model seem to be hit or miss."
1,Boring,"Another book on this subject that is written too much like a textbook. Not only is the writing style incredibly boring, the author places too much emphasis on other writers and ""experts"" in the field. I didn't want a book about reviews of others, I wanted to read Vaughan's theories, and there are none. I actually kept falling asleep!"
5,My Reactions:,"My best friend introduced me to this book and once I started it, i couldn't put it down. It was like I was there, with the narrator, while he was telling me this story of his life with Branch, Jody, Nicki, and James and i felt as if for a short period of time, I was there with them. It let me reach inside and touch something that I never knew was there"
3,Like the Northwest weather...this book is starkly gray.,"After Nirvana is Lee Williams' odyssey of five runaway teens living off the hard streets of Portland and Seattle. With a forcefully graphic style, Williams effectively and minutely details Portland's city streets, the hustling, the drugs, and the faceless sex. It is a staid, emotionless novel fully consistent with the emotional insulation of the teens. However, it also is a story where suppressed emotions occasionally break out showing the teens to be nothing more than cold, frightened, lonely kids. It is an interesting read, even though the ending is somewhat predictable. Overall, After Nirvana is an exceptional depiction modern hustlers and an excellent portrayal of street kids in the nineties."
2,"Not bad, but...","While Lee Williams deserves praise for revealing the twisted routines of the book's ""post-grunge"" characters, I found the story itself lacking. It seems as though the author came to the table with a concept rather than a storyline...the whole ending (with Branch) was a something of a cop-out and the character of Jody was so totally cliched (textbook hippie Deadhead type) that there was hardly a mention of her name did not lead to much rolling of eyes on my part. As mentioned above, Williams shocks and scores with his portrayal of these street kids and their universe, but perhaps it could have been accomplished better if published in something of a documentary format."
2,over rated for that price,they fit good in some areas and fit bad in other areas it will not lay flat in areas and over priced will not buy again!!!
2,"Nice cover, plain sheet",I bought this set for my 3 year old. The flat-sheet and the pillow cases have the Diego character but the fitted sheet is a plain ugly dark blue and green. There is no picture of Diego anywhere on it. It is only bearable if the fitted sheet is covered with the flat sheet. What a disappointment it is for my daughter to raise the flat sheet and see no Diego. Please be advised accordingly as this is not evident from the picture.
2,Only one pillow case,"The ad says it has 2 standard pillow cases but it arrived and the package says one fitted sheet, one flat sheet and ONE standard pillow case. I'm giving it as a gift and haven't opened it but it should include what the ad says."
3,Too Brief,"This is a brief book that, because of its brevity, leaves you thinking that much more could have been said - and probably should have. Kendall does a good job opening up the basics of the assurance of salvation. The problem is that he introduces some ideas (like the imputation of the faith of Christ being synonymous with the righteousness of God demonstrated in the active and passive obedience of Christ) that deserve a far more detailed and extensive study. Good for a evening read, though - or to give to someone who is having doubts about their salvation."
5,Inspiration and Awe,"Inspiration and awe is what I felt after I listened to this cd. Roger imbues every song with genuine emotional clarity. ""Awakenings"" awakened in me a feeling of kinship with my own humanity."
2,One interesing piece!,"ALL of my reviews are positive, due to the fact that I only buy figures noted for their durability and sculpt :)...now, on to the review...I have purchased the green copy of this figure which in my opinion, isn't as good as the orange and is sadly more common :(due to its size compared to the other figures, Alien Spawn 2 is a good grab, the only figures that would beat this figure in looks is Raven and Pirate Spawn, NONE would better this figure in durability due to the excellent choice of softer yet stronger plastic, this is almost IMPOSSIBLE to break, but don't take my word for it, see for yourself :)detail seems a little less drawn than say, Pirate Spawn or the figures from the previous Movie Maniac line, but it sports an eccentric pose and a very arcane, demonic yet space monster look to it, highly recomendable at fans of McFarlane and his work.Enjoy."
4,originality all the way,"veering away from the old reuse of a certain mold or ignoring the hasbro school of the mold/accessory shell game, McFarlane has given us a new shocking alien spawn. details. God is in the details and that is why Spawn demands the other toy lines' respect on the shelf. Not intended for GI Joe action, but nonetheless, an incredible toy. Imagine what Spielberg could have fathomed if he had grown up with these things..."
5,SCARY MONSTER THING!!!!,"Ok, so its very cool, impossible to destroy, tall, mean looking, has evil tendancies and a serious collection of spike/ horn / pointy things. The figure is also pretty strong too...I have mine kneeling holding Raven spawn with one hand ( raven's leg is bent on its knee for added support)and it has good balance even with Raven spawn hanging on him. It is translucent which is a cool effect and where as its a little stiff, for this character its actualy an advantage. The figure can pose in almost any arrangement and is easily one of my favourites. The pictures do not do it justice. I wasnt going to buy it until I saw the character in ""person"" , after that I was sold."
2,Sent the wrong item,When I first purchased this item I was really excited to get these for my son's birthday party. However when the item arrived it was the completly wrong product. They had send a simulation helicopter kit rather than plastic balls for children. Unfortunatly it took so long corresponding back and forth that I didnt have the balls in time for my party & ended up having to get them from Walmart ugh. The seller did return the item with out giving me to much guff and I just returned the items out right & didnt exchange because I had already purchased the 200 balls for 20$ at walmart for the party.
3,"interesting subject, lousy writing","Chikatilo's story is an interesting and provocative one. At its best, this book shows how a Soviet era sociopath is able to exploit his political affiliations with the communist party to act out his sadistic urges repeatedly over decades. At its worst, the writing is flat, clumsy and clichéd."
2,Poorly written with few details,Thought this would be full of information about a serial killer but it was in poor and broken english all about the writer's experiences researching the book. What a disappointment!
2,High Volume Air Pump,"I purchased this air pump seeking a pump that would be able to power a large set of airstones at a depth of 3 feet. Many other pumps that I tried were not quite up to the task.This pump is louder than a standard vibrator pump, but if you need a heavy duty device that pumps a lot of air, then this is the one.Update: 8/18/2012 - I'm sorry to report that the pump has failed after 8 months of service at a depth of 3 feet. Although the pump was loud, it was acceptable given the volume of air that it pumped when new. However, over time it got louder and then lost the ability to provide even a meager amount of air at a depth of 3 feet."
2,Got Used Pump,Pump arrived and the box containing the pump had been opened and the plastic handle on top of the pump was brokern. I have hooked it up and it has been running for a couple of days. Hopefully it will last. When I bought this I thought I was getting an unused pump that was not damaged.
3,Witty but drags in places,"Rather interesting book on the travails of middle class English country family at the turn of the 20th century. Some scenes are laugh out loud funny but many feature dry English humor. A good read for a rainy day, lounging on the sofa with a cup of tea."
3,Charming but Dated,"This was a simply written and quite charming novel. Whilst it did give an insight into the lives of a moderately wealthy English family in 1931, it lacked plot and real structure and for this reason I am unlikely to read more by this author at this stage - especially when there are simply too many other great books out there to read. A gentle, easy read but a little disappointing."
3,A decent shampoo for sheepskin,"I purchased this shampoo to wash my sheepskin rug, which looked dirty and ratty after having it for only a few months. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was hoping that after using this shampoo, it would be soft and shiny again. To my dismay, it came out of my washing machine looking worse than before. I washed it with cold water and combed it out just like every website had instructed me to do. It now has a fluffy appearance and the hairs are curly, looking much like an afro-just as another reviewer described. It also shrunk, though maybe this was my mistake for putting it in the washing machine. I wouldn't say that it completely ruined my rug, but it definitely looked better before I washed it. Perhaps if I hand washed my rug, I would have gotten different results. Overall, I don't recommend using this shampoo for your sheepskin rug in the washing machine."
4,Good book,"I thought Going the Distance was a good book. If you were into the greatest generation of heavyweight fighters like I was, I think It's a must read. Norton goes into detail about his relationship with Ali. He also describes a lot of his big fights in great detail, possibly a little to much detail on that but the book is still a good read for true boxing fans."
5,A book every American and law student should read,This book is an eye opener. It give you the truth behind the justice system from the perpective of a Sumpreme Court Judge who exposed the racism in the court system in New York. I never heard of Bruce Wright and happen I purchased this book. I have a lot of respect for the author.
3,"""Not the best, not the worst""","Live and Let Die was an OKAY movie. It has some pretty good action scenes and new cool gadgets. Unfortunately, it's not the best. I don't think there will EVER be a best movie yet. But still, I like the Pierce Brosnan movies because they have more action.The other 60's movies are horrible.In Live and Let Die, there's a scene where Bond skips over alligators and blows up a house. I think that was the best scene. It was only two minutes long, though.I give Bond a 3 for nice action, cool gadgets, and too much talk scenes."
3,not the worst,"Although Live And Let Die is very dated and cartoonish,I found myself intersted in this film because Roger Moore is a funny Bond. Here he only has one real memorable scene as bond . He seems to pretty and tame to beat peeople up.Yet, it its this stillness which make him such an effcetive bond later on. I enjoyed the drup plot and i liked Jane Seymour< wORTH WATCHING FOR Moore's debyut and some good action seque"
3,Eerste Bond-film met Moore,"Moore legt duidelijk een andere ziel in de rol van Bond, de films krijgen een komische tint vanaf dan, ook het begin van de carrière van Jane Semour, een goed film als start van Roger Moore, goed verhaal."
3,Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the surrealistic world of 007!,"With this movie Roger Moore debuted for the pretended rescue of the previous saga. Perhaps it does not sound exaggerate to affirm that we are before the weakest Opus of this agent. It was certainly, a thin service to his Majesty.An anthological hodgepodge, that counted with a very famous soundtrack and the undeniable presence of the angelical Jane Seymour, but there are infamous car chases, and a visible turn and twists of character around this Secret Agent that almost remit us to a surrealistic circus. The crocodiles sequence is one of the major absurdities ever filmed. It was a serious reverse, a terrible jab to the admirable good taste and imagination of the previous films, that reduced ostensibly the well deserved status of 007 to become a cartoon network.Give me a break!"
2,Offensive,"Frankly, I think this is the worst James Bond movie, and I found the portrayals of African Americans offensive. Roger Moore made a great Bond, but this was a poor film to start him off with. Buy Goldfinger or the Spy Who Loved Me instead."
4,Yaphet Kotto OWNS Jane Seymour,This is the B-LACK one in the James Bond cannon. There's everything described by the other reviewers but beautiful Jane Seymour was burned in my brain at the time and I have to have it. Her character's story is so crazy and she's psychic with a deck of cards. Yaphet Kotto sounds so insane when he talks about her that I laugh whenever I think about it. It's not exactly gay Clifton Webb in Laura or body dismorphic disordered Mel Ferrer in Lili but it's right up there.
5,"Solid Bond film, Great Picture",Unlike some I enjoy the Roger Moore era for what it was and Live and Let Die is a solid entry in his era. I especially like the nice saturated colors used in the cinematography which this Blu-ray really takes advantage of. The picture quality is pretty amazing for a film from the early 70's and I liked the audio as well. This is a must for any Bond collector or for fans of the film.
3,"Good movie, horrible tape quality","A good 007 movie, but I could only see it three times. It didn't want to run anymore on my VHS player. It got stuck forever"
3,Moore could have had a better Bond launch,"This could have been a much better movie if there were more action, Q and a car. Bond did have a cool watch though, it had a magnet that could ""deflect a path of a bullet"". More truck driver language though. When trying to get away from Kananga's henchmen Bond got in a plane at a flying school with an old lady in it. The bad guys went to shut the door in a hangar. Just feet awy from getting half of the wing shopped off the old lady said ""holy sh**""."
3,Good Debut for Moore,"Unlike Sean Connery, Moore's earlier Movies were his weakest and got better as they came along, where as Connery's earlier films were his best. Roger Moore of course had big shoes to fill when he took the role of 007 and did rather well giving Bond a new look and a different kind of charm, and adding a little more humor to the Bond films. My favorite part of this movie has got to be the alligator farm stunt when 007 runs across the heads of the crocks, and ""Sheriff J.W. Peppa"" who brings lots of laughs in his very short role in the movie, if it wasnt for him this film would have gotten 2 stars rather than my 3. I didn't like M going to Bond's home to give him his assignment and his gagets instead of Q. Where was Q in this film? Overall it was an enjoyable film, not one of the best in the collection but still enjoyable to watch."
5,From Scranton PA,"Well, what can I say...I love all the James Bond Movies!!! And this movie is no different, despite what people say about it. If I had a chance to make this movie over, I would not chance a thing. After all, the majority of the movies were made with little or no computer enhancements that we are accustomed to in this day and age. But for their time, these movies were top-of-the-line action movies. I give 2 thumbs up to ""Live and Let Die""!!"
3,Moore....Roger Moore!,"After Sean Connery said that he would not do any more Bond films, producers Albert.R Broccoli and Harry Salztman searched for a replacement. Known for T.V's The Saint, Roger Moore was an excellent choice to step into Connery's large shoes. Taking the character into a new area of humour as dry as a vodka martini, Moore eases into the role with much more subtlety and suave-ness ...The plot is never really explained properly (something about drug smugglers), but the action makes up for the lack of story with crocodiles, snakes, Paul McCartney's groovy title song and an excellent speedboat chase that rivals any other. Not the best Bond by far, but a solid addition to the franchise."
5,Live and Let Die.,This is one of my favorite Bond film with Roger Moore. The reason why I liked it is because it's not like any other Bond film ever. It takes the viewer from New Orleans to the darkest depths of Haiti. It involves the mysteries of voodoo as well as twists and turns throughout the movie. It's a Bond film that every 007 fan should watch.Kris L. CocKayne
3,Bondsploitation,"Moore's is the most low-key debut in the series -- he's bland and knows it. There's some good action, but more of the crass humor from Diamonds Are Forever and when 007 heads up to Harlem you'll wince. Luckily, Kotto is the most nuanced villian besides Klaus Maria Branduer in Never Say Never Again. Great Extras."
2,Audio Problems,"I'm hanging on to my DVD copy because there is 10 minutes or so towards the end of the blu ray film containing very muffled audio. I'm skimming through other reviews here and oddly enough, I can't find any other mention of it. Can someone verify with me that their copy also has a section of poor sound? Does anyone know if the newly repackaged release (Oct. 2012) has improved this audio flaw? Comments please."
3,Moore's solid start,"Live and Let Die is one of those Bond films you find hard to put in a ""winners and losers"" list. LALD makes a slight deviation from previous 007 entries in that instead of presenting a plot for world domination, the bad guy plans to seize control of the heroin market and then get everyone hooked on it! LALD is a truly entertaining film-just watch the (overlong) boat chase if you don't believe me. But there are aspects which are clearly lacking as well. The film generally lacks depth, and it looks fairly dated as well. Bond looks totally out of place in Harlem, and as for Sheriff J.W. Pepper, he may be funny but he adds nothing to the film. This was Roger Moore's first time out as Bond, and he is GREAT in the role, although I think ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", ""Moonraker"" and ""Octopussy"" provided him with better opportunities. But Live and Let Die still makes for good Friday night entertainment though."
2,Difficulty Playing Blu-Ray,"I could not watch any bonus features on my stand alone Blu-ray player, even with the latest updates. The movie itself played fine after taking some time to load.Picture and sound are outstanding upgrades! The movie itself sucks. I grew up with Roger Moore as Bond, and have collected them all in every format. That will stop now with Blu-ray. I only rented this one, thank god. As other reviewers have noted, it really is a bad film all around, and Moore never plays it serious. Yech!"
1,you gotta love roger to like this...,I guess you'd also have to like Roger Moore in order to enjoy seeing him as 007 esp after Connery.
2,Shocked at these positive reviews....,"Has anyone who loves Live & Let Die ever seen another Bond movie? Where do I start with this extremely weak film? Other than the theme song, a cool voodoo/graveyard sequence and the alligator pond, this is one of the low points in the franchise. Short on action and exotic locals, but packed with ghetto slang, goofy characters and an overall lack of secret agent ""coolness"". The 1960's were at an end and this movie is just way too early 70's looking (and sounding). Overall it's more dated than Dr No (made 10 years prior) if that's even possible. The Spy Who Loved Me is the film that won me over as far as the Moore years go. This (for me) was a terrible start for Roger Moore. It's like a long episode of Starsky & Hutch....but boring."
3,bond goes to harlem,james bond is zapped into a 70`s/blaxpoitation setting with a fresh jane seymor for roger moore to charm persistently in only the way roger can do.LALD is entertaining in a campy way with memorable performances by yaphet kotto as the bond villian and seymor as a tarot card-reading virgin.with adequate action scenes this is one of the better roger moore episodes of 007.
3,"Reasonably entertaining, but not essential Bond viewing.","Roger Moore's debut as 007 finds him tackling a Carribean drug kingpin. While the film is exciting at some points, and has its fair share of deathtraps and pitfalls for Bond to overcome, it lacks the bite of the earlier films, particularly the first three in the series. Indeed, the most noteworthy aspect of the film is the theme song performed by Paul McCartney. Altogether, a serviceably entertaining, if not thoroughly satisfying, entry in the Bond series."
5,"""The cards have followed you for me.""","The debut of the best actor to portray James Bond 007- Roger Moore! This film has a little bit of everything. Dr. Kananga is a drug dealer that also plays the harlem guy Mr. Big. Solitare plays the bond girl that uses her special powers to help Kananga. Of course 007 uses his own powers on her and the stage is set for boat chases, crocodile escapes and voodoo ceremonies! Paul McCartney and the Wings perform one of the most memorable songs in the series! This film is GREAT! I have seen it 253 times and so should you!!!!!"
2,Far From Bond's Best,"It is hard to label certain elements of the movie as ""Good"" or ""Bad"", for many elements tend to be both good and bad. For example, I will review the villains. There were many strong villains, and an immortal Baron Samedi and robot-armed Tee-Hee were interesting, but too far-fetched. I liked the ending, but Baron Samedi alive and on riding the front of a train is too fantastic. Jane Seymour was very pretty, but looked too young and innocent. I would like to quote Steven Jay Rubin when I say that when she is in bed with Bond, she looks almost like ""she's being taken advantage of"". Roger Moore is Bond in this one, and I've never accepted him as Bond, despite his seven Bond films. To see a Bond film that is good (despite Roger Moore) I'd recommend ""The Spy who Loved Me"", ""For Your Eyes Only"", or ""Octopussy"". Of Moore's films (which seemed to be either very good or very bad), this ranks right in the middle."
3,Moore has done better,"Live And Let Die was very odd. The Voodoo meets drugs plot was kinda stupid. Some of the action scenes were good. Some were down right cheesy. This is one of Moore's weaker Bond films. Id rather see Bond try and save the word, not fight Voodoo warriors. This reminded me of the so-so Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom a little. Such a departure of what made the seried great. And it does not go the series justice. Better than the extrememly lame Moonraker. But well below The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only ans a couple others Roger Moore stared in."
3,Odd Bond,This probably the oddest Bond film of the whole series. Of course one has to take intoacoount that it was made in the early 70's and it portrays a feeling of the period but still the producers tried to make Moore different in every aspect from Connery. I am not a fun of Roger Moore but this film is quite interesting as it is the closest that the series has ever come into becoming a cult film. An extra bonus are the scenes shot in the grand old south that are quite interesting.
1,The worst Bond film,Live and Let Die is the most lousy James Bond movie ever made. Roger Moore is so cheesy and stupid!
2,Moore is no 007!!!!!!,"This movie bites! It's too comical to be a Bonds movie and i seen them all. Bond is not too intelligent and not too wise, because the villians are something off of a Shaft movie, and didn't really scare me like the villians of previous bonds with Connery. Also, i dont like Roger Moore as Bond so that didnt help either lol. He make a good Q replacement but not Bond. The movie is so corny its shameful. That plastic green snake in the beginning of the movie just before the music intro was so [unrealistic], ...You didn't even see the bite mark on that guy before he fake his death. And agents getting stab on a corner, not once but it happen twice it too much. What i like about this movie, solitair played by jane seymore and the paul mcartney song 'live and let die' at the beginning. It's probably the best song next to the Octapussy song by Rita. If your a bond fan, watch it but dont say i didnt warn ya."
2,The most boring film in the 007 series!,"Yes, the most boring James Bond flick of them all. The action scenes are dull as wood compared to the over-the-top stuff you see in the Connery films and in Moore's better efforts like ""Moonraker"" (Moore's most under-rated 007 film, and the movie that made me a Bond fan in the first place, way back at the tender age of 10) and ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" It takes at least half an hour before James even kills anybody!The film also suffers from Q's (Desmond Llewellyn's) hiatus.What's more, the Wings' title track is okay, but it's over-rated! It blows my mind that, and the title track to ""A View to a Kill"" are the most popular Bond songs of all time, yet they accompany the two dullest Bond films of all time.Too much time wasted on voodoo schlock as well, especially the closing bit with that laughing creep.Roger Moore did much better with the aforementioned titles . . ."
1,The Name Is Bland . . . James Bland,"If you want to pinpoint where the 007 series took a nosedive into unadulterated silliness, look no further than ""Live and Let Die"" (1973). Roger Moore makes his debut as James Bland in this ridiculous blaxploitation-style thriller with slapstick action sequences. The only redeeming aspect is Paul McCartney's Oscar-nominated title song, which deserved a far better film."
4,"I liked it, for a Moore movie","I just thought the movie was well made, and Moore did a good job in this one."
5,"Agent 007 must decide who he will let ""Live and Let Die""","This is one of my favorite James Bond movies available in the 007 film library. This particular one is very, very special to me because this was my very first Bond film that I saw. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to watch more of the Bond movies and I was just amazed at the stunts and filmography involved in them. My favorite part in the movie is the boat chase towards the end of the movie. Bond leads a team of boats through the tributaries of Lousiana and in the process ruins a wedding reception. This is a great movie making it a classic Bond movie and you should order this on DVD format (Digital Video Disc) for the highest sound and picture quality available. You're not only getting excellent picture quality, but also added features like audio commentary by the film makers and my favorite, the theatrical trailer."
3,"Hurricane Katrina reminds me of ""Live and Let Die""","Yes, Hurricane Katrina reminds of some soulful stereotypes of blacks in the Western psyche i.e. black evil vooodoo worshippers, racist cops, sexual stereo-types as evident in the book and movie, ""Live and Let Die."" What more can I say......"
1,Live and Let Die.,"This is Bond Meets San Francisco(theliberalism part) but it's not In California it's in Harlem of all places,Never mind that it is not a blaxploitation film,if it were it should Feature the Lovely Pam Grier but instead we get an Ugly weaveless/wigless And hideously muscular female character(unless your Sly Stallone and you like your women to be buff.),No cool cars except well Custom or As I say Messed up Looking Cadillacs,and Chevrolets all over the Highway(Chevy Gets a Special Thanks,but why No Corvettes?Oh wait I know...)Then you have the Voodoo story,it is just plain awful for a Bond film.This happens when you give in to current so-called popular culture or ""Counter-Culture""(yeah the Man is after us Dig?)."
3,A decent movie,"The weirdest thing about Moore's movies is that tehy seem more outdated than Connery's. I'm not sure why, but for some reason they always feel un-bondish. I like this movie (he made worse ones later), but it feels starange at times."
4,Moore did a fine job,"I thought Live And Let Die was a very good Bond film.Not the best,but very good.It's got a good villain named Kananga,and a gorgeous Bond girl called Solitaire.It also features a great henchman with a steel arm that has a claw for a hand.(his real arm was bitten off by an alligator!)The theme song by Paul McCartney and Wings is a classic.Overall,while not being Moore's best outing as Bond,I thought he did a fine job,and it's a very good movie."
5,"Move over Rover, for Roger is taking over...","Finally, the real Bond, Roger Moore of course, takes over and gives the franchise a much-needed facelift. Moore was initially considered for the Bond role when the series first began and it is a shame he wasn't there from the beginning. Oh well, better late-than-never! One more Connery film probably would have destroyed the series for good. Right from the onset, the opening scene in Bond's apartment, it is quite clear that we now have a more sophisticated, witty and charming Bond. Moore's Bond seduces his women with charm and intelligence rather than, as Connery's Bond did, 'he-maning' his way into their pants. As for the film itself, some of the highlights include the following: Bond's miraculous escape from a lake of man-eating crocodiles, the river boat chase (which is filmed brilliantly), and Bond's final encounter with Mr. Big / Kananga. All in all, this film set the stage for the Moore / Bond years and what a glorious run it was to be."
4,The first of Roger Moore's seven Bond films,"Roger Moore's initial foray as 007 remains his most successful; he never worked as hard again at being James Bond. At this point (and probably for the last time), the series still maintained vestiges of Cultural Importance. Plus it has crocodiles. Unfortunately, George Martin's scoring for the film dispenses with the James Bond theme entirely, opting instead to rely solely upon Paul McCartney's (admittedly excellent) title song. 7.5/10"
2,Not the best of the James Bond movies.,"Live and Let Die, released in 1973, was the 8th James Bond movie, and the debut of Roger Moore as agent 007 (third actor to play the character). It sure ain't that great for a Bond film. The film's story seemed just ridiculous. I mean, the villains alone have as much gadgets as Bond himself and always seem to know where he is. They seem to capture Bond on several occasions so easily. Bond is a secret agent, so how how do they about him?Not the best debut for Roger Moore as Bond, but his performance as 007 would get better by latter films in the series (1977's The Spy Who Loved Me), but still, his performance as Bond in Live and Let Die is a change after the departures of Sean Connery and George Lazenby. Jane Seymour (TV's Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman) plays Solitaire, the Bond girl in this film. Yaphet Kotto plays the villain, who is an international drug dealer. There's still some great action sequences as usual for a Bond movie."
5,THE BEST BOND FLICK EVER!!!!!!,"Roger Moore's performance as 007 in this film really changed from Sean Connery's acting as 007 in the prevous film, Diamonds Are Forever. Moore is more with car chases and the women that Sean was, and that's what makes him awesome. In this movie, 007 is sent to find the man responsible for killing two British Agents, and he finds the man responsible, Kananga. Kananga is trying to get the whole USA hooked on heroine, and Bond is the only one who can stop him! He gets the help of card dealer Solitare, the hottest babe in any of the movies!!! Some of Kananga's henchman are: Teehee, a man who got his right arm bit off by a crocodile and now has a dangerous steel arm that can cut anything! Also is Baron Semidi, the voodoo weirdo. Some gadgets are Bond's magnetic wrist watch, and a gun that has gas pellets as bullets. A great movie, must watch!!!!!"
3,Good old movie,Since this movie was made in the 70's it is a little corny now days but still entertaining and the sound track alone is with the price.
4,love james bond movies,i believe one of the best Roger Moore james bond movies...love it and 1 more movie to go to complete my list...thank you Amazon.com..keep up the great service to us.
3,Moore's First Bond A mixed bag.,"The Spy Who Loved Me is the bond film where Roger Moore finally nailed the Bond character. This film has a lot going for it. The positive is Moore although already 45 was at the peak of his looks, so his youthful appearence is quite enjoyable to see. Secondly the wonderful Jane Seymour as Solitaire. Yaphet Kotto as kananaga. All around casting good. The bus chase and boat chase are amazing. However, the film is dated by the emphasis on the Superfly persona of the time. It also has Bond going after a drug kingpin rather than the usual meglmaniac. Although the drug plot is refreshing. Moore is a little wooden at times and he ssems to be living under Sean Connerys shadow although this was his first time. Th ecinematagrophy is not panavision."
1,You Get What You Pay For,This is a very lame BB gun and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone but it was cheap so I don't feel like I was ripped off or anything. I Should have known better in the first place because I also have a Marksman 1010 pistol so I'm a two time loser. If you're looking for a BB gun I would suggest you pass on Marksman products.
1,very poor quality,"The site was broken right out of the box. The entire gun is cheap and flimsy-feeling for the money - much more so than I would have imagined. I think the vendor may agree, as they reimbursed us for the entire price and shipping - and didn't even want it back!"
2,More Academic Than Enjoyable,"Instead of merely translating a number of common myths and legends, the authors explain each story in a summary fashion, and always in third person. I personally found this to be very distracting, not to mention a little dry. If you are looking for a book which captures the spirit of the Japanese tales instead of merely recounting their basic plot lines, this is not the book for you."
5,Lonesome Hank,Really like album but sound quality is not perfect which is somewhat common in recording made in that era. The problem in NOT the CD it is the technology originally used
5,great video for tournament players,this is a great video for players who are comfortable with their strokes but want to learn how to formulate a game plan. this is mosty strategy and tactics.
4,Enjoyed the view master,"My daughter enjoyed the slides and the view master. However, she bores with it quickly. It's entertaining though."
5,Fantastic product!,Thank you so much! We were new home buyers and needed everything for our pool. This was an all-in-one kit that was at that perfect price! Thank you!
4,Fun Educational Game!,My 3 year old loves playing this game. It is great game to practice counting. I would recommend this game highly.
3,A Game of Chance,"Hi Ho Cherry-O is a game of chance that includes cute little red cherries. Gameplay is very simple. You just spin the spinner and whatever number the arrow lands on is how many cherries you receive. But if you land on a dog or bird, you lose all of your cherries. The player with the most cherries wins. Aimed toward the preschool and kindergarten level, this colorful game teaches counting, as well as good sportsmanship. And parents can be free of guilt, since the game is up to chance, so you're not really lying when your child asks if you let them win! I recommend this game to little ones who aren't quite ready for the big-kid games."
3,Not well thought out for the younger users.,"My daughter, just turned 3, really likes it but there are some problems. She has very good fine motor skills for her age and it is still a bit difficult to pick up the tiny cherries by the stem when putting them on or taking them off the board. Any sudden movement can send the cherries rolling. And the spinner board is not conducive to learning numbers because the triangles are quite narrow and the arrow is very close to covering the numbers so a younger child will have a hard time seeing them even when an adult is pointing out what the arrow is meant to indicate."
5,Hi Ho Cherry-O,"Our family loves this game!My almost 4 year old want to play it everyday. and my almost 2 year old loves to spin the ""clock"" and put his fruit in basket.Teaches kids to count and wait their turn :)and Design is very pretty too!!"
5,Thanks,"Love the game, hopefully I can convince the dog to not eat all the cherries...lol My son is 3 and has a blast playing"
4,Christmas Gift,"I purchased this classic game from Amazon as a gift for my youngest Grand-Daughter. I told her how I use to have one when I was a little boy and that my sister's and I would play for hours when the weather was bad outside. All the Grand-Children were eager to play the same game their Grandpa had played too. It is a very simple game, no batteries required. It teaches young minds how to count."
4,Great for teaching turn-play,"This is a good toy to teach your child turn-play. The quality of the material is okay. There are extra cherries now in the box(there were negative reviews in the past about this). The size is right, the colors are vibrant, durability is just fine. But again, its value comes from its easiness to teach turn-play. Children gave a better reaction to waiting and taking turns while playing Cherry-O when compared to playing with Candyland. A little pricey but all similar toys are around this price."
5,Hi Ho Cherry O,"This game is as fun to play as an adult as it was when I was a child! My 3 year old daughter loves it and it helps her with her counting. The pieces are small, but as long as you're not playing around little ones it's not a big problem."
4,Learning fun,"This is a great first game for 3-4 year olds. My daughter loves to play, and learned some beginning counting."
3,This is a very cute game but,"I really like this game but I have one big problem with it, if someone accidently bumps it all the cherries fall off the trees. There has to be a better way to make the cherry stay put. Oh and dont dare take out the baskets or cherries will fall under and then you have to lift the whole thing to get them and before you know it you have cherries all over the place. Other than the problem with the cherries staying in place this is a very cute game."
3,Kids love it...,"I was a little disappointed that the fruits were not all cherries. The product information says get all the ""cherries"" in your bucket. However there were only 10 cherries. The other pieces were blueberries, oranges and apples. This is not Hi Ho Cherry-O but Hi Ho Fruity-O.I loved playing this game when my kids were little. The concept is pretty much the same, and 3 and 4 year old niece and nephew like to play."
5,Perfect fun counting game,I bought this for my 5 year old daughter. She loves it. It helps her with simple addition and subtraction. Fun classic game
4,GREAT GAME,I bought this for my granddaughter who is 5 years old and she loves it. We played it for over an hour.
4,Just don't let them know they are learning!,"This classic game is a big hit among pre-school and kindergartners. I played it as a child, and use it with my students now. It is excellent for building beginning number concepts. Kids love to play this game (just don't tell them that they are learning!)"
4,Three Year Old Loves This Toy,"My daughter received this game for her 3rd Birthday and she loves playing with it. It teaches children to take turns and count. This is my child's first board game, and I think it would be a good first board game for any child."
4,Wonderful First Counting Game For Kids,"I remember playing Hi Ho Cherry-O as a child. I also remember how much I loved it. When we got this game for our daughter, she immediately took to it. It's a very simple game with easy-to-learn instructions. Simply spin the arrow to determine how many cherries you get to pick from your tree, land on the dog or crow to lose two cherries OR hit the spilled bucket and lose everything. This game teaches basic counting, addition and subtraction in a fun and easy way.You can pass quite a bit of time playing this game with your young child. Not only will it teach them fundamental skills (emphasis on ""fun""), but it will take you back to your own childhood. I highly recommend this game."
2,Hi Ho Cherry-o,"I am so disappointed with this version of the game. I remember my kids liked this game - it was much better than CandyLand. I remember it was the buckets that told you the color of the 2-4 people playing and I bought this for my grandson who is now almost 2 1/2 years old. I liked the game in the past for the counting up to 4 and teaching colors. In this version everyone has a different TREE and the colors are not true colors. There's a cherry tree with light red playing pieces; an orange tree that is YELLOW; a green tree with light green apples; and worse of all, a BLUEBERRY TREE (blueberries grow on bushes) that is PURPLE. What in the world were they thinking of when they redid this game! They should be ashamed of themselves, making this for young kids with untrue colors and having a blueberry TREE. My grandson likes this game but it is not the toy that I thought I was getting. The old version was much, much better-- a fun game and learning toy. Joyce"
4,The game is fine,"The game itself is fine, however Hasbro seems to have some serious QA problems as the game was missing a bucket. Everything else was there. Hopefully they can resolve this.The seller, was fine; however so the rating is reflective of my experience with them. I received the game in a timely manner and in a non-descript brown box 9which was great as this was for Christmas). Very happy with the seller. I have contacted them to tell them about the defective product they received, so they can be alert for any future issues from Hasbro."
5,Love it,"Purchased this for my 3-year old daughter's birthday. She loves to play and I love that it teaches her counting, friendly competition, and sharing. Money very well spent."
5,Fun Fun Fun,"Our daughter just got this as her first game. She loved this...spinning the arrow around...and counting the cherries. She has just loved carrying the box around. We will be playing this for a long time...great learning for counting, taking turns!!!Great Gift Idea"
3,Great New Colors Since I Was a Kid,"My son (2 1/2) is still too young to play. So I can't tell you how well it holds a child's attention span. I think its great that the fruit pieces come in different colors now. I just worry about loosing the pieces since they are small. I think it will be great for sorting by color, counting and learniing about turn taking."
3,too hard for grown-up fingers,"I thought this game would be great for my daughter and my day care children, however the cherries are too little for grow-up fingers. The small children need help, but it is too irritating for me to help them with. It has set in my closet for several years without any use."
5,Just like I remembered,My granddaughter wanted this for Christmas - who was I to deny her? I loved this game as a child and it's just as much fun now!Colored cherries and a spinner is all you need to have fun with a 3 year old. We both enjoyed playing!
4,"cheaply made, but fun for my two year old","It's bright and fun and my daughter enjoys it. Sometimes we play the cooperative game and work together, although it is absolutely impossible to lose this way the odds are very stacked, which limits the teachability there. Other times we play the 'competitive' version and I like that there is no skill involved. I worry about the small size of the peices and am extra careful with a baby around. To me the real negative is how cheaply the game board is made. One errant step by a preschool will squash that raised board and break it. Hopefully that won't happen for a while."
4,Great game for early academics and fine motor,"This game is great for my 4-year-old who is working on counting with 1:1 correspondence, and as a relatively easy beginners game, it teaches following directions, etc without being too complicated for little ones. It's also great for fine motor development because you have to set up, manipulate, etc. the super small fruit. My son loves it and I like that he's working on important skills without realizing it. For those who are die-hard fans of this game from their childhood, note that they changed the color of the fruits (instead of everyone having red cherries, each player has a different colored fruit like blueberries, red cherries, etc.). I don't care, but somebody might?"
3,Not as great as original,As expected this isn't the same quality as the ones we played as kids. The fruit is small but my 2 year old loves it. She drives me crazy because she wants to play it so much. The biggest gain on this is its a game she wants to play but HAS to takes turns. Which helps her get along with big sis lol
3,Highly Education and Highly Tedious,"Let me say this game it perfect for teaching basic game rules and counting.That said, this game is so tedious, it even bores ritualistic 3-7 year olds.You put the cherries on the tree, you move them one by one into the bucket, and just when someone has almost picked all the cherries and the misery is almost over, you spin a dog, bird, or spilled bucket and start over again.Utter torture."
4,Hi Ho Cherry O,This was a cool game when I was a boy. Now my son will learn to count and have fun with the family too.
1,"Ho-Hum, Cherry-O","I used to play this game with my mom. Recently, I played it with my niece, who is 4. I now feel bad about all the times I made my mom play it with me. As we were playing, my niece said, ""I'm not really having much fun, I'm just playing it for you.""That about sums it up - ""Hi Ho Cherry-O - bores the britches off 4-year olds.""You spin the wheel. A number comes up. You pick some cherries. You spin the wheel. The birds come. You lose some cherries. The last person to get bored and leave wins.Personally, I think eating boogers is more entertaining.-m"
3,I admit to being sucked into this book by its cover.,"This book is a remake (a tenth anniversary) of an earlier publication of the same name. Being that I don't care for cutsey wooden plaques, and the red, white, and blue of the ""original"" American Country look made famous so many years ago, I was hoping for the best with Formal Country.It just did not live up to the terminology ""formal"" for my tastes."
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this course because of all the great reviews it got, but although I found it helpful, it didn't improve dramatically my level of French. What you are taught, you are taught well, but given the expense, I would have expected to learn sigificantly more of the language.If you have money to burn and want to learn French, buy it. But if you don't have bottomless pockets, you'd be better off getting the likes of the Michel Thomas CDs and the Living Language courses, which provide way more information about the French language, which is far more complex than the Pimsleur course allows for. And they are much better value."
3,good but far too pricey,"This language learning CD is aimed at the notoriously very difficult to assess and highly variable ""intermediate"" level...where performance in one area such as grammar may be far ahead or behind other areas such as pronunciation and vocabulary. This is very characteristic of the asymmetrical performance of the ""intermediate"" group.The course is a good product, no doubt., but it is extremely overpriced particularly in the context of it having 6 levels you can potentially purchase, 1a, 1b, 2a, etc.A better choice would be to rent this from places such as Recorded Books."
2,Terrible speakers,"I went through French I and II and thought were very good. I just started volume III and I'm not sure I can continue. I have the 1998 edition and I have to say they chose the worst speakers they could find.The female speaker (Carpenter) talks like an old lady in a high pitch voice like she's always screaming. The male speaker (DeRobert) varies his speech that you think he is trying to over act a play or trying to win a reading contest. He sometimes does not fully pronounce the words. The French instructor speaker (Clement) is very good though.It's a huge difference from volume I and II. If you;re getting volume III, get a different edition with different speakers. For me, I might just sell this one on eBay and get a new edition because the speakers are too annoying and can't learn much."
3,Too pricey and too limited,"The reviewer from Ireland expressed it well. What you are taught, you are taught well, but for the price you should expect to be taught much more.The FSI courses, althought they can be boring, are much better value."
5,Excellent - shipped quickly and was in perfect condition,Excellent - shipped quickly and was in perfect condition and at a great price...I am very satistfied with this purchase
3,servicable earmuffs,i think these are good knock-around ear muffs. i think i saw them at a different site for less $ though. i was kinda disappointed i didn't find myself the best deal i could've on them.
5,Hearing ear muffs,"Works well, I use these whenever I have to protect my ears from the high decibel power tools.I have several so if I misplace one, I have a spare or if I have a helper."
2,Not nearly as good as the Peltor H10A muffs,"These Milwaukee muffs are cheap things. I bought a pair about a year ago, but they turned brittle and were never very comfortable. I also found they aren't very good - they are okay. I didn't expect a lot for the price, but a few months ago I purchased a pair of Peltor H10A muffs for just about $10.00 more, and boy were they worth it! They're much better made, better looking, more comfortable, and reduce noise levels more. Now I really regret the time I spent with Milwaukee muffs. They're just not worth it."
3,Maybe,These block noise well but they have a lot of clamping pressure and get uncomfortable after five minutes.A foam pad fell off easily.They should have a bag to keep them clean.Good to hang near saw or cutting station.
3,not as good as the other two in this universe,"I didn't find The Northern Girl as entertaining as the other two in this universe [Watchtower; The Dancers of Arun]; In fact, I didn't find myself much interested in anything until the very end of the book. She continues with her familiar themes: the flexibility of human love and sexual attraction, and the necessity of force to bring and maintain peace. It's as competently written as the other two, though the pacing seems much slower [and it could be that I simply wasn't as interested in the story]. I'm not sorry I read it, but I don't think I'll ever re-read it.A note: It's not necessary to read the first two books to understand this one; all of them can be read out-of-turn."
2,unrated version,"the other reviewer must have seen the xxx version ,this is the unrated version .if you like softcore porn and comedy i would recommend this however the movie is not so nice,i would avoid this movie like the tears of gypsies"
4,"Great Product, fast shipping","No problems, shipped on time, works well. Don't forget to buy NO2 cartridges to go with"
2,Good at First,"After a couple of years of steady use: 1) Bent dispenser handle (its stamped sheet metal; flimsy) 2) cracked plastic head (thin) 3) bent nozzle thread base (thin).If your use is occasional its a good buy; but if you expect it to last...it won't.Get the stainless models; twice as much, but much more ruggedly built (there's a reason brand Fourbucks is using them)As always the Customer is the Test Lab..."
1,crap,broke first day and kids are using this poison dispenser to inhale gas! please do not sell unless to chefs

3,Ex con vs. bikers in small town desert,"This should have been a great movie but comes up short because of the boring soundtrack and a seemingly rushed production. Almost no tension is generated here and the movie becomes just another (but well executed) action piece. Ex con Busey takes on an army of biker bullies lead by the great William Smith. Using demolition, several deadly traps, brutal determination, and a badass bullet proof-pickup that is fully armed, he blows them away for killing his wife. Talented actors gary busey and william smith aren't given very much dramatic to say but their presence is undeniable. Purely from an action standpoint the movie is full of brilliant stunts and fight scenes. I got this movie because so far I can't find anything busey did in the 90's that is better. With some beer this movie becomes a 4 star instead."
5,The forgotten 80's action masterpiece,"I found this in a pawnshop on VHS and I could not resist. Gary Busey + 80's action movie + Eye of the Tiger theme song= how did I miss this! This is almost as good as Roadhouse, which is the gold standard for eighties action movies. If you like Roadhouse, check this out. You will be glad you did. Mad props to Gary Busey for this one. I can't believe it took me 25 years to actually find this."
3,I always liked this movie.,"I like this movie even though it is old but if the Eye Of The Tiger song by Survivor wasn't part of the film, then I wouldn't have thought much of it. Gary Busey has always been a good actor though and I am surprised that he never made it to the 'A' list as an actor in hollywood. It is a fun movie to watch only once but after a few times it gets boring so if you are picky with your movies...I suggest you don't choose this one. I hope one day there will be a remake of this movie as Eye Of The Tiger (song/movie)deserves to be re-born again."
4,a fine translation of some NLP techniques and principles,"Contrary to what the title might make you think, you don't need NLP knowledge in order to use this book. The way it's written makes it even hard to recognize the NLP bits (I had to search for them).Why only 4 stars? Even if the book is well written and is easy to understand, I had expected more from the book. The authors should have added some extra chapters dealing with other learnings from NLP that apply for relationships. Maybe I should be happy, at least that leaves room for others to write books. Also, the publisher has applied some low cost techniques: the paper is a bit cheap and the font used is a bit small.Patrick E.C. Merlevede, MSc -- co-author of ""7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence"""
3,Mixed Feelings,"I definitely sympathize with Barna's concerns and frustrations with the local church in America. His research clearly shows a lot of problems. However, I don't know that I totally agree with his solution. Just because there is stagnation and complacency in the local church, do we throw it out? Or should real revolutionaries try to change things from within? Centralized church and its hierarchy carries its share of problems, but so does a leaderless, go your own way Christian life. Seems like it would be more productive to advocate for revolutionary reforms in the local church rather than to advocate for leaving the church and spiritual anarchy. The book was a good start to a conversation on the problems in the local church, but goes too far in its prescriptions."
3,there are churches in the revolution,"There are churches are living outside their walls...Barna seems to have missed this. One of the most radical churches missionally appears to be NorthWood Church. Their pastor has documented some of the story and principles behind a radical redefinition of a church measure by societal transformation. The book, titled Transformation by Bob Roberts, shows how, despite Revolutions leanings, churches can be as ""dangerous"" as they were in the first century. An amazing story that is not contained in the four walls but attracting radical, Kingdom entrepenuers. It checks out. Barna seems to have missed that this is possible. Is the local expression of the Church beyond hope in the revolution? Maybe not."
5,Fantastic Insight,"Barna hits a home run with this very insightful look into the Church today. His description of a ""Revolutionary"" is right on, and his understanding of the struggle and suggestions for the future are very encouraging. There are, in fact, many of us who yearn to ""be the Church and not just go to church"". This book is a great manifesto that articulates deep seeded passions to follow Jesus Christ in a way sorely lacking in the church today. Be prepared to either have your world turned upside down, or to let out a resounding cheer as you see him as either a heretic or a prophet. This revolution will change the world."
4,Honest...,"Whether Barna displays his personal passion in this book or not is neither here nor there. His passion spills out of a love to reach people for Christ. The whole point of REVOLUTION is living radically for God. It would be a shame for anyone to write off Barna's book because it questions current church structures. You can never get better at something unless you step back and discect what the current sittuation is.""There can be no movement in our lives until we are confronted with the reality of our current state."" -Peter GreigI would argue that Movement in the church in America is Slow if not at a stop. Barna's book is helpful in defining our current state, its up to you to create movement.Love God Love People,Brandon"
4,Possible Trouble for Churches,"Barna is right on target with how many people who have attended church for years feel about the organized church today. I have shared the book with several friends who say: ""Wow, this is just how I feel?"" I have had the discussion with even more I knew were feeling this way. My problem is: One of the things a church should provide is the feeling of community. If the church loses its abililty to provide that feeling, what is the affect on the spread of the gospel of Jesus. People concerned with this should use this book as a discussion tool. Gary Trawick"
1,Uncharacteristically Disappointing Barna,"I was excited to pick up this book and finished thinking what a complete waste of cash. Barna has traditionally written great books that are so well-researched. But this was a carpet salesman's worst pitch. Barna goes to an area where he's honestly just not gifted -- unbridled advocacy. What's worse he tries to weave this book as half research and half blatant lobbyist for the ""simple church"" -- and fails on both fronts. There are so many things noticeably absent in this book that would be vintage Barna. Where's the chapter on potential flaws and pitfalls of a simple church? He certainly presents a laundry list of flaws with traditional churches. Where's the explanation that house churches existed in the first century largely because of persecution -- not that it was Jesus' preferred model."
3,Disconnected,"I have enjoyed reading Barnas books. His analysis is helpful in answering the question ""Where are they now?"" referring to the people who used to go to church.The first half of the book is disturbing, as intended, but the second half, drawing from Matthew and Romans, was assuring.""Revolution"" did not motivate me nearly as much as his previous book ""The Second Coming of the Church.""Following Jesus sometimes draws us alone into the wilderness or the desert but we all have a part in the body of Christ. A lone soldier is easy for the enemy to pick off. But an army has marching orders, back up, support, and strength. How do we 'love one another' as an independent mercenary?"
3,Really only about 2.5 stars,"George Barna has to be one of the most negative authors I have read through the years. I would love to know what kind of church member his pastor would say he is. Or does he even go to church? Probably one of these pioneering revolutionaries himself, huh?The book may be based on research, but it sounded more like a sermon based on his personal dissatisfaction rather than research based material.I agree that the church of America is lacking and we need to take a serious look at some things that we need to improve. But I still believe in the church and the influence we can have on society.If you want a better book with a more positive and helpful information, read Surprising Insights of the Unchurched or Breakout Churches by Dr. Thom Rainer. At least his reveals the data that was compiled and he sprinkles his opinion. Not like Barna who sprinkles research in with his opinion.Save your money on this book and buy one of Rainer's."
5,Great Read!,This is an excellent book regarding what God is doing in His Church. He addresses with clarity what some people are feeling about their local church experience. It is a book to be reckoned with and it reflects what I have been feeling about church life for quite some time. Get this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Okay but not great!,"I strongly agree with the simple church and house church structure. However, George Barna seem to fall short in this book. This book read like one with a theory rather than someone with experience. I expect more statistics from George Barna, and this book falls short in that arena. He possibly should do a follow up with research data relating to the simple house church movement."
3,its ok,"This book was not that great. It had a lot of stats and lots of info, but nothing I didn't already know."
4,Become a recognized authority in your field in 60 days,"Lots of good advise about becoming a guru in your field. However, I questioned trying to accomplish this in 60 days or less.I can easily say that I am a guru in my field because of my 45 years experience in the real estate business. It was 45 years not 60 days.Good explanation of the types of gurus and how people take to them."
5,"Covers all the ways, compares old methods as well as new","Bob Bly's book covers a large number of promotional techniques, yet provides more than enough details on each. What is particularly great about this book are the comparisons of old techniques, like printed newsletters, to newer ones, like e-zines.From his years of experience he provides opinions on which techniques are better to use and under which conditions to use them.He covers several of the secret weapons that he uses for his own firm.I highly recommend this book for anyone in business, and it should be considered required reading by all consultants. Also, any book on direct marketing by Bly is highly recommended -- particularly on Business-To-Business marketing.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"
4,Solid stuff,"This book is full of good, solid material for anyone looking at expanding their personal ""brand"", whether they're entrepeneurs, people starting non-profits or just trying to get their message out.While I can hardly claim to follow the advice on every page, I was pleasantly surprised to find out I've been doing much of this in growing The Cranky Middle Manager podcast [...].. thanks Robert"
5,Differentiation is Key,"I heartily recommend all of Bly's books--this one is no exception.Bly rightfully points out that the difference between an authority (or as Bly puts it, ""guru"") and everyone else in a particular field is that one individual is perceived as the ""expert"" while the others remain...well, average. It isn't a matter of the guru knowing more. It's a matter of the guru establishing himself as an expert by using the simple strategies and techniques outlined in this book.Gurus separate themselves from the pack and stand out as someone who is expert in their given vocation. And the truth is that this isn't that hard to do, really.Bly covers everything you need to do to attain ""Authority"" or ""Guru"" status. He lays out in simple fashion what needs to be done. All you need is the desire to learn AND implement these steps.If you want to increase your income and your prestige, get this book. You won't be sorry!"
3,An exercise in lying?,"In this game players respond to ethical (or unethical) situations, and the other players have to decide whether they believe the answer is truthful or not.I have played this game several times with a variety of people, some whom I know well, others not so well. What I have found is that in most cases players quickly learn that they get ahead in the game more quickly when they find ways to mislead their opponents. This includes conveying answers of partial truth, and even out and out lying. That bothers me. There is no penalty for lying or benefit for telling the truth when someone responds to the ethical situations presented during the game.This can be a fun game, but I find games like ""Therapy"" by Pressman Toys to be a better ice breaker and get-to-know-you game than this one.A passable game, but not destined to be a classic.Alan Holyoak"
4,"fun game for groups, but very expensive","this game is a lot of fun for a group of friends. it leads to conversations, but be aware some answers might start little fights! all part of the game though. the cost is way to expensive in my opinion, i purchased for about 100 dollars, but that seemed to be the going rate. very easy game to learn, and fun for a group of friends or family who know little tidbits on each other. not really great for children."
3,Racky Au GO GO!,"Memories of '69 with Raquel. This is the kind of cool cinema trash that's hard not to enjoy. Raquel gives Ann-Margret a run for her money as a graduate of the Pussycat School of Acting. There's a priceless bit when a gas-station attendant asks Raquel if she works at a nearby hospital and she says: ""Yes, I'm a brain surgeon!"". You definitely get what you pay for with FLARE UP - and there's music by Les Baxter, too!"
4,DVD,I am believe that I recieved the best possible opportunity to view James Stacy's proformance in this DVD. For collectors of JS's work I feel that this is a good purchase.
3,For Die-Hards Only,"I was actually at a show from this tour and it seemed a lot better than represented here.This is cool for a time capsule, and there are some okay performances of some songs, but they're undercut by the bad mix and iffy camera work.Oh, and then those horns. Thank God THAT idea never took hold after this tour. Eeesh.The only thing worse than the horns was Sting's foot-synth which he uses on a couple of songs. The effect, in a word: tragic. It sounds more like a car alarm than a good musical idea.Far, far superior is the Synchronicity concert--buy that.AND wait for ""Police Around the World"" to come out on DVD. That is the best document of early Police and has killer performances from all over the world."
3,Decent midperiod Police performance,"Having seen the Police on their 1st, final, and reunion tours, I have to say while this is an enjoyable concert I feel a bit disapointed in this show. Stings decision to eat pineapple throughout the show may have helped his voice, but it also left him foaming at the mouth which is kind of distracting. Stewarts decision to tape a nasty message to Sting on his kit limits the camera shots from behind the drummer. There is more of the jazzy influence creeping in as well. Still worth seeing for any Police fan!"
5,Do you believe in the force?,"You will after playing with this toy. It shoots the discs out so fast, you have to feel when to swing to bat them down, rather than see--""Your eyes can deceive you, so don't use them."" If you want your kid to be able to hit a fast ball, get them started with this game. I got two of them, one for my nephew, one for myself on a whim. I got lucky the first time and managed to hit one out of twelve.I was nervous that the game would work, but it blew me out of the water right away. The droid rotates smoothly on the stand, no sticking or catching and the discs fire at the speed of light. The light saber makes sound as you move it, you only have to keep holding down a button that let's the droid part you're ready.There is no way you can go wrong with this toy. I would think it would have originally sold for around $40, it's a steal atthe price now. The kids will love it, you'll love it and so will your wallet."
5,WOW!,"I bought this toy, and all I can say is wow! The droid rotates on it's stand untill it detects your lightsaber. It will give 2-3 beeps (depending on which level your on.) There are two levels. Once it picks up your saber, the droid WILL track you anywhere it goes. Once you are in a still position it will fire a tracer disk at you, almost at the speed of light. Deflect it! The game works bet if you make sure that the back of the lightsaber is always facin the droid and you are directly behind the lightsaber. Overall it is an awsome game!"
2,Didn't work very well,"My son received this toy a while back and while it looks nice, it never worked properly. The Probe Droid part would spin and beep a lot but it would very seldom actually shoot out the disks. You had to hold the light saber just inches away from the sensors to maybe get a disk to shoot out. My son would grow impatient and gave up on using it. We finally threw out the droid part, keeping just the light saber, which my son still plays with."
2,probe droid,This toy sort got pushed in the garage. My child liked the toy. The light saber breaks easily. Its's a threeFrom mom and child
5,My man Franks,"Ain't no man can sooth u like Michael Franks can, even more so being laid back at christmas time. If u don't get it, there's something incomplete about u're collection. There ain't no mellow without this album."
5,Great Michael Franks eclectic lyrics!,"I really enjoyed this CD even though it isn't near Christmas time. His lyrics to the songs are so great no matter what time of year! I loved the melodies too. My favorite song was ""I Bought You a Plastic Star (For Your Aluminum Tree)"" - excellent!"
5,The Snow,"If you have followed Michael from his debut, you will hear the sounds from some of those albums. You will like this album a lot."
3,happy sappy Christmas,"I like sappy Christmas stuff, but this was a little too much, even for me. It just tries a little too hard to be a little too cute. I love Christmas jazz but more the Bette Midler Cool Yule sort of stuff. As much as I wanted to like this, it just didn't do it for me. Frank's voice just sort of gets on my nerves after one or two song."
5,Real 5 star Franks,"This CD has it all. A GREAT sound quality, and a very exciting reportoireto boot. Michael Franks gives us, in his usual delicate manner, a collection winter/Christmas songs without even touching the standard sweetChristmas-commercial-sort of thing. My favourite is ""Christmas in Kyoto"", with lyrics taking you right there and then.This is my most frequently played Michael Franks album."
1,Baaaaaad Sound,"Just plain awful, that's for sure... sound so terrible it isn't funny. Music loud then voices low..save your money (And I got this in a ""Bargain bin"" for 1 dollar!)"
1,Bad rehash of generally known information,This collection is yet another attempt to squeeze money out of World War II buffs by unscrupulous production companies. Each episode casts a very broad net and creates questions which the episode never really answers. However the subjects are covered vastly better in just about any 1 hour History Channel or Discovery Channel documentary. The producers use an English narrator apparently for the sole purpose of sounding authoritative (a la Lawrence Olivier narrating the BBC series 'World at War'). This series is not an English production. Don't waste your time. Even if you see it in the bargain bin cause it's not even worth 2 or 3 dollars from there.
2,A rip-off. Only for the die-hard Third Reich fans,"A utter utter rip-off. These bad BAD people are making a profit by ripping you off. There are some short sequences of interesting videos, packaged into a box set, but of low production quality. Inexcusable. Only for the true die-hard Third Reich fans. Wait for it to appear in the bargain bin. Very sad. Makes me Sick Heil! Or, as the Germans used to say, this is pure Kotz durchs Fenster (Vomit out of the Window) stuff."
1,Obviously.....,"The last reviewer was the author, manufacturer or distributor of the DVD series! Sounds just like an ad!"
4,A great start to a sheik series!,"I found the hero's attitude (I am a prince, you should be honored) very realistic. The poor heroine is clueless, but delightful. I enjoyed how she made her hero sweat it out and the scenes between them were delightful. However...the only thing that dropped my personal rating of this book from a 5 to a 4 1/2 was the ending. It seemed too abrupt and as if the heroine gave in. I did feel that the hero grew throughout the book, and that is rare in this type of stories. Good job!"
2,Just okay,I have read all 13 books of this series this one was the least I enjoyed. I was getting upset on how much her weight was brought up. Speacially at the end when Amber called her a fat cow or the writer kept pointing out Dora was not pretty. I think the book would have been a better read if it was not for this.
1,Very tired of reading it,"I have to work with DShow for my job. This book is the only one available (afaik)... But it is awfully written.Mark D. Pesce does not EXPLAIN anything, he just DESCRIBES a set of, more or less enhanced, SDK samples.It is a shame.I will read it from the start to the very end because I have to do so. I am really tired of this."
2,Too little on VMR,"I wanted to read more about the new VMR9, but the book disappointed me with the thin coverage of VMR9 and videoplayback in general. I guess the book is all right on the topics filters, video editing and video caption."
5,Thorough but easy to understand,I really like this DVD. Linda Jones shows you so many beautiful design techniques and she makes them very easy to understand. When you get through with this DVD you will not believe all of the skills you learned to incorporate into your designs.
5,"Great game, although...","This is a great game and my son loves it. The service was fast. The only thing is that when I received it, the timer and dice were missing. This was not mentioned in the description. The seller was very gracious, though, and I appreciate the actions they took to resolve the matter."
4,a 10 year old boy,its fun and very educational. My 8 year old brother loves this game and my parents do too. I would recemend this game for ages 7 to adult.
4,"Read on to see what four ""concerned"" children can do...","Another engaging, rambling account of Gerald Durrell'sinteresting,to say the least, childhood.The title story recounts the attempts made by the brood tomarry off their mother for her ""benefit"", in their words.The chaos and tumult that follow must be read to be reallyappreciated.The other stories in the book describe in vivid detail someof the amazing incidents that happened during the family'sstay on the beautiful island that is Corfu.Definitely worth spending many afternoons re-reading thisbook, with a cup of hot chocolate and cookies.You might thinkyou were one of the many guests this family has had."
2,"Disappointing compared to ""My Family and Other Animals""","I read this book hoping for another gem like ""My Family and Other Animals"". Unfortunately, I was disappointed.Although ""Marrying Off Mother"" has much of the same wonderful timing & wit that's in other Durrell books, it seems to be missing their soul. This is a cynical book, and the timing & wit (that in earlier books shows Durrell's innonence and passion) conveys smugness and superiority in ""Marrying off Mother"". This attitude wears thin pretty quickly.If you're interested in reading Durrell, I strongly recommend ""My Family and Other Animals"". But not this book."
5,Marrying off Mother,One of Durrell's best! Sadly he died in 1995 and he is missed by his many fans. Suggestion: Buy and read all of his books. There's an education to be had and many laughs to enjoy.
2,Disappointing,"The only good stories in this book were ""Marrying off Mother"" and the story of Esmerelda the truffle pig. It tided me over until I found the sequel to ""My Family and Other Animals"" - ""Birds, Beasts and Relatives"".Glad I borrowed this one from the library..."
3,the misadventures of Durrell,Another entertaining offering from Gerald Durrell although some of the stories are a bit on the more fanciful line as opposed to his normal wildlife related narrations. But an entertaining read regardless!
3,Not his best,"As much as I have always loved Gerald Durrell, this book is not his best. Actually, it is a pale imitation of Durrell in top form. It is worth reading, however, because Durrell at his worst is better than many writers at their best."
5,"I'd Put More Thumbs Up, But I Only Have 2","This book is a great book for ANYONE even slightly interested in Judaism--and it's very easy to understand...even for 16-year-olds like me. I agree that this book respectfully potrays all movements of Judaism. The authors display a love of tradition, but understand the importance of common sense, and seek to maintain that balance. As a former Christian (considering Judaism as an option), I also appreciate their respect for Christianity... But anyway...I like how they don't assume you're a complete idiot, but they make sure you understand the important things before you head of to a service, where you might embarass yourself...Well my point (and I do have one) to all of this is that Judaism for Dummies is worth every penny I spent.(duh.) :)"
5,Very interesting stuff.,"Falcon and Blatner really dive deep into the Jewish faith and give details on stuff like basic beliefs, the festivals, Jewish history, and the whole Jewish mysticism/Kabbalah thing. There are some sidebars about what to do if you're not Jewish and you've been invited to something like a synagogue service or a wedding which should be really helpful. So enjoy."
4,WOW!...I like this ALOT ! !,"I can't imagine how I would have survived giving a presentation during the past High Holiday, Yom Kippur.I was faced with a room of folks that thought they knew what it was to be a Jew or to be JewISH, and not a one of them had many clues.It was nice to have this format so that I could highlight my way through what eventually became a great presentation, and a great gathering of learning women."
4,great beginner book,"This book covers the very basic concepts of Judaism. For the beginners that want to learn about this very exciting area of study, or for the people who want a base into learning Juaism. I found this book very helpful!"
5,Not Jewish But,"I am using this book as part of a study I'm conducting in a Protestant SS Class. Using it as a supplement to ""Judaism and Chrisitanity: A contrast. Good simple review of the Jewish faith that is simple for all to understand."
5,"Wonderful, joyful and scriptual",This portrayal of the gospel of Jesus Christ set in the modern day southern U.S. is a wonderful way to identify with the characters of the Gospel. It is true to the scripture yet written in a touching and amusing way that enables the viewer to understand this profound story that is the basis for the Christian faith.
5,"Outstanding, hilarious, poignant, gripping.","Tom Key does an outstanding job portraying the various characters in all their different modes. The supporting cast of ""pickers and singers"" are extremely talented and not only does their music blend beautifully, but so does their part in making this a full and splendid experience in enjoying the gospel of Matthew."
1,Cotton Patch need fertilized not sanitized,"This version of Clarence Jordan's adaptations of the Gospelstories is weak, lacking in the depth of the social gospelmessage which Clarence provided to an earlier generation ofprejudiced Americans who so easily accepted a civil religion thatglossed over the tyranny and oppression which still are at theheart of our culture. Nothing has changed. The gloss is just abit shinier and phonier. The bozos who sing and act in the back-ground make the quality comparable to a low budget 3 StoogesComedy. The story teller is right out of the local Bible BookStore which sells nothing to make you upset about the status quo.The movie made me angry. This is not what Clarence would have wanted for his legacy.Good for children 8 and under."
4,Trashes the Trasher,"Kitty Kelley must have never heard the old aphorism, ""don't dish it out, if you can't take it"" because this unauthorized biography caused her considerable well publicized consternation. Her response is certainly understandable because the referenced source materials certainly surpass the innuendo and outright sophistry of her books, and the charges against her are severe. From shoplifting to rampant dishonesty (that allegation should cause little surprise among those familiar with her work), to uninhibited sexual hi-jinks, Carpozi throws it all at Kelley, and it certainly is enjoyable watching him score so many bull's eyes. His most striking charge is the strong possibility that Kelley gave birth to an illegitimate child in her much younger days. While that may never be proven, there is no denying that she has given birth to a huge body of illegitimate literature that has disgraced her far more than it could ever hurt her intended targets."
2,Butterfly not up to expectations,"I love solor lights in my garden and love butterflies. I ordered this and it seemed solidily made, but it didn't stand up to the strong winds out here in the desert. Both wings broke off so now I just have a body that still lights up. The company needs to make the wings a little bit more durable for water (between rain and the spriklers hitting it) along with the wind, the metal for the wings just didn't hold up. Product needs improvement."
5,"Awesome product, great value","I bought this tool belt without even seeing it. In fact, I bought 6 of them as Christmas gifts. When I unpacked the package, I was amazed to see the very high quality of materials and craftsmanship, considering what it cost. The material(canvas, leather, nylon belt) are top quality and heavy duty. The only drawback I found is the belt takes some effort to adjust because of the sturdiness of it. Definitely worth the price. Kudos to McGuire Nicholas."
5,A delightfully colorful and electrifying book!,"This book captures all of the magic of Walt Disney's Snow White and transfers it to the pop-ups and pull tabs that children as young as two can joyfully discover for themselves. As a mother of a two year old who loves nothing more than parking himself in front of Walt Disney's treasury of videos, this book provides a welcome change from the glassy eyed gaze of a video transfixed toddler, to an eager, hands-on explorer of one of Disney's best loved films. Kids will love how the images come alive as they work their way through the book. It is very interactive and it provides hours of entertainment. This is a must buy for any young fan of Disney and any parent who would like to vary their children's intake of pop culture. A great stocking stuffer or Hanukkah gift for a young person. If you are looking for something different, give this book a try and prepare to be very pleased with your purchase"
3,Not Recommended for Individual Purchase,"This is a faithful recapitulation of the Disney animated movie of the same name, featuring colorful scenes from the film. As a rehash of the movie, it is okay, but the picture book format highlights the dated qualities of the film. Characters are often shown in Victorian dramatic poses, mouth agape, which diminishes, rather than enlivens the text. Also, I miss the comical scene of Snow White, who, due to her relative height, must stretch out across several of the dwarfs` beds lined up next to each other, in order to take a nap. There are other, better versions of this fairy tale for small children, so don`t go out of your way for this one."
4,Poignant - The last days living with Aids,"I was struck with the humanity of the book. Dr Baxter gives an accurate insight into the last days of the ""lepers of our society"". He is a rare find in today's medical circle. He treats his patient with respect and kindness, doing his best to make sure that their final days are as comfortable as possible in the midst of a horrendous journey into death. Here is a doctor with a heart. He has no ""God complex"". He does not seek to make his patients live at all costs but rather, helps them to die with some dignity. The fine print of the book may be a hinderance to some readers but I felt the book was well worth the struggle. Would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject and those who have seen too much of the negative side of our medical providers. I especially liked that the hospital cared enough to provide a memorial rememberance of these people who are often so alone."
3,It works,"The last on we bought (made in China) didn't last very long, just over the able to return time. This one seems to be doing alot better."
3,Not bad for what you pay,"I bought this to let my Cavalry OSUT Troops have a horn to tute in the fine traditions of the Cav. It looks great and the tone is dead on EXCEPT. If you are a bugler or play any horn, this bugle's note progression is 1,5,8 not 1,3,5,8. Meaning I can play C, G. amd C while I should be able to hit the E between. I had another bugle player try and he could not either.A beatiful little horn and a fine wall hanger but not good for most bugle calls."
1,bad bugle,bugle has wrong pitch. Do not buy this for your son if he wants to be the scout troop bugler
3,Brass Bugle,"The bugle is certainly functional, with a good finish. It was however, a little bit crooked, like it had been made hastily or bent after being made. Doesn't affect the playing, but not the most pleasing appearance."
3,"bought 3, one was clogged","I bought 3 of these recently. 1 is clogged and I'll return it, hence the low rating. (I took a bugle lesson from a local professional trumpet player, who confirmed that it is clogged.)Other than that, I am satisfied. He played the two that do work quite remarkably - certainly compared to the noise I could get out of them. He did note that they were very low quality trumpets, but hearing him play them, they sounded great.(I've actually just ordered another (4th) to replace the one that I am returning. These and one lesson each are gifts for some relatives/kids - and hopefully will be a refreshing gift from the standard toys and books I give.)"
1,"Musicians, do not buy!","My music teacher husband could not play this, as hard as he tried. Certainly not an ""instrument"" I would not wish to give my musical grandson. Maybe I will decorate a Christmas wreath with it."
4,One of Burts' Best,"I believe this is one of Burt Lancasters best movies. He creates the energy to this movie along with Ozzie Davis. I admired how they took the racial biasness of that day and used it in intellectual mockery with twist of understandings. Talk about life put on the big screen, this is it coupled with non-stop action, twist and turns. This should have been an Oscar movie for both guys and movie director."
2,Not long-lasting,"I bought this sticky pad in the spring (April 2006, I believe) and through no over-use on my part it has now lost its stickiness and is very ineffective. It is also peeling off the dash. It is only 3 months old, so this makes no sense to me. I recommend getting a different brand that might last longer."
4,terrible fly paper,"i bought this thinking it was fly paper but boy was i wrong. i havent caught a single dadgum fly yet. on the up side it does keep my toll tag and phone from flying across my dash, which is nice."
2,sticky pads,"the size of the pads is why i ordered them , but when i opened two of them the edge's of the pads curled up and would not stay down , i had to tape them to the dash , not a very neat install but its all i could do with these pads . even after a week sitting on my dash in the sun the pads would not lay flat.."
2,Doesn't stay sticky,"Very sticky at first, but soon thereafter (maybe several weeks) it becomes slick - phone goes airborne. If I put it under water and scrub with my fingers, it seems to return some stickiness. Maybe I'll try some sandpaper, however it's not as advertised."
2,A Good idea - not so well executed - try a nanogrip instead,"The handstands pad works great on most places - though on my dashboard it doesnt seem to stick properly - the items stay on, but it doesnt stick properly to the dashboard.I later bought a nanogrip from nanogrip.dk - even though its a bit more expensive, this one actually WORKS - almost too good ;p"
1,Terrible product!!! Nothing Sticks to it.,"I was hoping to use the pad so that I can attach my phone to the dashboard of my car. However, it is so weak that it barely holds onto dashboard. Of course, I can just forget about attaching anythingelse. NOTHING STICKS TO IT!!! I am only writing this review so other people won't waste their money like I did. Please don't spend money on it."
1,Handstands super size sticky pad-black,This pad non stick at all?????!!!!!i'm very disappointedanyway i keep because this is too muchtrouble for me to sent back to you
2,Mine did not last too long,"I bought Samsonite eye shades. AT first, I was very please with it. It is very light and comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, after I used it a couple of times, the inside layer started to come out. It is a shame how little it lasted.Samsonite Eye Shades & Earplugs"
5,The best black tea,"I am a tea fanatic. I have tried so many black teas, it is not funny. I have tried organic ones, exotic ones, flavored ones, cheap ones, expensive ones etc. But, this one is the best I have found. Right off the shelves of my Safeway supermarket. It is strong, has a good quick, but it is still pleasant. Well, if you are a tea aficionado, you will understand what I mean. Surprisingly enough, I have discovered that several big-name grocery stores no longer carry it. Order it online!"
5,good tea,got it for my wife for a christmas present and she like this tea a lot. twining had it shipped to me in less then a week
5,Best Twinings Tea Made!,I love this tea. Always have trouble finding it to purchase in Ontario so I had it shipped to Florida and brought it home with me on my last vacation. This is the best morning black tea around.
5,My Favorite Black Tea,"This is my all-time favorite black tea. I drink it with sugar, no cream or milk.The tea steeps quickly, and in 4 minutes you have a perfectly brewed cup of tea. Lighter in flavor or color than most English teas, this is still stronger and more flavorful than almost all American teas, be Lipton or Tetely.The flavor is slightly sweet with floral hints. It is very smooth and satisfying. I find it delicious any time of the day. It has almost no tannin after taste, and has low acidity."
2,Not a fan!,"It's interesting that so many people seem to enjoy this tea. I just tried it in a sampler pack, and thought it was just the most dreadful tea I've ever had! Tart, yet flavorless. In my opinion, it tastes like you brewed Lipton's tea for 20 seconds, and added a touch of lemon juice. With that said, I tend to NOT like any kind of fruit flavored teas whatsoever, and prefer PG Tips - which I find balanced and flavorful, never bitter. Obviously, this tea has many fans & I am the odd man out! But none the less - If you don't like fruit teas, you probably won't enjoy this due to it's tart overtone - even though it's not a fruit tea."
3,"lighter than the ""breakfasts""","dark tea, rather light flavor. i thought i would try something other my standbys, english and irish breakfast. the taste is also lighter than earl grey."
3,Not British Tea !,"Warning - this tea was packaged in the US - not the UK. Hence, it is weak and tasteless compared to the British equivalent. Very disappointing."
4,HANDS OFF PLEASE,"The title of this effective little chiller comes from the number of bones in the human hand. Nasaw's third entry in the Pender series finds our recently retired FBI agent summoned by an old friend to the island of St. Luke to investigate the brutal murders of a serial killer(s). The reader knows who the culprits are right off the bat, but Nasaw effectively weaves his suspenseful tale by throwing in some interesting subplots and some uniquely envisioned characters. The island atmosphere and language is captured convincingly and the pacing is good for a novel where the suspense comes from wondering when and how the culprits will be apprehended. Good entry and should keep Pender alive for a few more books."
1,A Miss,"The characters' actions don't always make sense. The descriptions of torture and sex seem to serve no purpose other than repulsing the reader. There's no redeeming quality to the novel, so I can't recommend it."
2,"Nothing Like ""Adored""","Nasaw's The Girls He Adored was a scary, thoughtful, and believable tale of horror and psychopathy. This one, Twenty-Seven Bones, is a light tale that's not terribly interesting.Someone or something is severing peoples' right hands and leaving them to exsanguinate. Ex-FBI Agent Pender is called by his friend, the chief at St. Luke's PD, to come out of retirement (unofficially), to track down the bad guy.The characters are pretty silly, and the story is pretty unbelievable. I was really ready for the story to end well before its time came. Skip this one."
2,Huh?,"Racially mixed children (one of whom has no arms) entrusted to the care of a lesbian aunt, a sexually obsessed archaeological team, a bald, fat FBI agent, a reporter with a Peeping Tom fixation, and a host of other equally shallow characters comprise the cast of this incredibly amateurish novel. Pass!"

4,Comfy and cute,"These are flats, but they are stylish. It took me FOREVER to find white pointy flats and I finally found them here on my fave site to buy things. And the free shipping is awesome."
1,king of ny,Video doe not work i will be returning this product.i was ready to watch this weekn but i could the disc was no good
5,Good Ole Fashion Gangsta,"Wesley and Lawrence (Larry) brought back some flava to the ride 'em , stick up movies. Along with NJC, SH, and DU- man is HIPHOP wonderful or what?Anyway, hopefully the next genre of...will have an IMPACT the way this ONE did!Y2K1"
3,A total fantasy,"Christopher Walken as an idealistic, EOE, Robin-Hood-inspired, freelance drug kingpin battling an NYPD death squad.Any questions?Not CW's best performance, either. But he is, as always, cool in a creepy way--give it 4 stars if you're a dedicated fan."
3,Good movie,"DVD was kinda bad quality. It was similar to a bootleg, I don't know if it was just due to being old?"
4,The King Is Here,"All Star Cast. Cult classic of the 90s gangster era. If New Jack City is in your movie collection, then add this as well."
3,Good film,Loved it this is a good film to watch with some popcorn on a rainy day. I watches this 2 times
5,rhythm,"Rhythm.Train tracks, rap tracks, coke rails, bullet trails.This is a Robin Hood story.The plot is kinda predictable.. but the actors are in a weird Nihilistic ZONE.Mssrs Fishburne, Walken, Caruso and Esposito do some of the best work in their careers up in here.I also applaud the women: Theresa Randle and Janet Julian.The Chinese gangster also A+ = Joey Chin. Brilliant performance.Thanks, Abel. It's so NYC."
3,Scarface wannabe...,"Not too bad, but it's a little over-stylish and tries to re-do what De Palma's Scarface did. Film's best feature: Laurence Fishburne. He was amazing in this and steals the movie. The opening shoot-out is great by the way. If you liked Scarface, this is probably worth a good look. It is pretty much the unofficial sequel to it (just look at what it says on top of the picture on the movie box). The dialogue was great, but there wasn't really too much of it. Abel Ferrera was concentrating too much on style and not enough on actual ""talking!""."
3,Christopher Walken's Best Role,This is truly Christopher Walken's classic performance. He plays his role in this movie very good. All the acting is good and the story is also pretty good. If you're a Christopher Walken fan get it.
5,The best gangster film you've probably never seen,"Ranking up there with Scarface and even Goodfellas, King of New York is one of the best gangster films ever made, thanks largely in part to the magnetic and explosive performance by Christopher Walken. Walken is Frank White, a ruthless kingpin freshly released from prison who vows to use his connections and money for charitable means. On his trail however, are three cops (David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo) who, by any means necessary, vow to bring Frank down. Profane, action packed, and filled with unforgettable performances (Walken, Caruso, and Laurence Fishburne are incredible), Abel Ferrara's King of New York is hypnotic from it's first frame to final shot, and the action scenes are pulled off better than most major budget pictures. This new Special Edition from Lion's Gate/Artisan includes a nice amount of extras to tide fans of the film over, and the commentary by director Ferrara must be heard to be believed."
3,"Great Cast, Great NY Locations, Acting, Directing and Story Lack Polish","Worth a watch for a look at some great actors, some before their prime, working in interesting NY locals. But unpolished direction/editing, erratic performances as well as a rather predictable story line lets you know early on this is a unfulfilled ""Scorsese meets Cimino"" wan-a-be effort."
3,"ok, i preferred New Jack City",Not enough story line or plot. Christopher walken is weird..as usual. A lot of stupid scenes. Maybe for the time it released it was awesome.
3,"It was all good, but it could be better.","I mean i love watching gangster pictures like this one. The movie was straight when i watch this on demand. Even the sceene was good. But at the end was kind of ridiculous. It could have ended differently. Thats why i gave it 3 stars. Although i will buy this movie for my friends birthday yaa know so he could look at something like this. He even loves gangster movies to. But the movie was good though but it could do just a little bit better. I mean like i said it ain't better than Scarface, New Jack City, or American Gangster with Danzel Washington. Other than that i enjoy watching movies on demand on amazon. Big up to Lawrence Fishburne and Wesly Snipes who played the part in this movie. And nice part that Christopher Walken played. Thanks amazon video on demand.De'Vear SmallRepresenting Decatur GA"
2,Stylish But Badly Structured.,"""King Of New York"" seems like a ""Scarface"" wanna-be. It has style, some good action scenes, but it drags ON. The story is not as interesting as the film's look, and Christopher Walken looks so...miserable. At 3 hours, ""Scarface"" is much more superior drama. ""King Of New York"" just sinks in an over-rated story. This is a small thing which the director and writer try to bloat. The look of the film is great, I'll give them credit for that, but the script is uninteresting. The ending leaves you so empty, that they should re-make this film. This movie almost works but chokes in it's own blood baths. What it needs is more interesting characters and situations along with better dialogue and less absurdity. I still stick with ""Scarface,"" now that's a REAL gangster movie."
1,This movie stinks,"I really like Christopher Walken, but this movie is a real dead dog. One of the worst movies I've ever seen - completely unrealistic, totally bad. I don't know how they got some of the actors in this stinker to show up and actually admit they had any part in this abomination. If you want a gangster movie, this isn't one - they spend more time emphasizing nudie club make scences than doing anything as far as developing a story or plot - a real stinker - not even worth the wrapper it's packaged in."
1,surprisingly dissapointing,"To have the audacity to utter the Name ""Scarface"" in the same sentence as this film's name is an insult to the brilliance of both Pacino and DePalma. The plot: Sad and predictable and manages to somehow cliche the urban drama without any surprises. A seasoned, brilliant actor like Walken lowers himself to such a film and it is an insult to his skill. He relies to much on his purposely awkward speech to define the role, along with a sullen countenance of a tired old man, which is not hard to do...we have seen it by many great actors in coming of age films (pacino, godfather III), (Deniro, Raging Bull). Walken taints his reputation as a serious actor with this film which is mostly a barrage of bologne. I do like the early performances by Fishburne, Snipes and Carusso. They all turned out to be wonderful additions to the action/drama film genre. Overall, a dissapointment."
2,Two stars for Walkens acting only.,"This movie was terrible. Walken was the only thing that helped me sit through it. Snipes did a terrible acting job and Fishborne did even a worse job. The plot was as deep as a cd case and on top of that, the cover says ""where scarface left off"" ok, scarface was amazing. this was aweful."
1,Horrid!,"I have seen just about every mobster movie ever made, some were good and some were bad but this takes the cake as being the work one of all those.Chistoher Walken should never have taken on the role as Frank. I'm am not saying he is a bad actor but he is horrible in the role as a ganster. This has a ton of action way to much action the whole movie is action way to much for my likeing. The storyline is horrible a guy gets out of jail and takes over the drug world of New York. The cops fianally get all over his place and take out his whole crew. nd at the end of the movie he lets a cop shoot him in the stomach, what an idoit! Why in the world would you let a cop shoot you.Bottom line this movie is horrible so do yourself a big favor and do not buy or even rent this movie ever. I'm sorry if you think I am being so cruel but you will wonder ehy they ever made this movie if you see it."
5,Christopher at his best!!,"This is a classic CW movie and he shines in this action packed classic. If you like this actor then this is a must have DVD. If violence makes you uneasy then grab your blankie to throw over your head when the action starts!! Chris plays a New York City tough being released from prison...and his original turf has been hijacked from him by competitors. His original gang memebers are still intact...and they set the stage for his release by ELIMINATION. As Christopher says in the movie...""I JUST DON'T FEEL ANY REMORSE."" He is a tough guy with a soft heart for his old neighborhood.....gotta see this one. This one compares with Al Pacino's shoot em up movies.....and it has a great supporting cast of well known actors."
2,Some inaccurate info,"This book seems to be more about how to gain a birthmother's trust and confidence in order to get her baby, and how to work the adoption system. In so doing, the book loses sight of the fact that adoption exists in order to provide children with loving homes, not to provide infertile couples with children.She does, however, help to explode a myth: that children placed for adoption are ""unwanted."" This is of course far from the truth, as Burns points out that birthmothers today usually aid in picking their child's parents and nearly always want to see, hold, and spend some time with their newborns prior to relinquishment.Still, some of the advice can get potential adoptive parents into trouble, such as placing ads for a baby. In many states this is illegal.Some advice in this book is helpful, but I must still urge potential adoptive parents to seek the assistance of a licensed adoption agency."
1,Appalling,"This book is basically aimed at manipulating, deceiving, and tricking pregnant women into placing their children. It's brutal and unethical. It takes advantage of the fact that prospective adoptive parents aren't thinking beyond getting the baby. But you have to raise an adoptive child---and how will that child feel when she discovers that her adoptive parents tricked her birthparents? What kind of a long term relationship will that gain for anybody?Adoption is about more than acquiring a baby. It sets up a lifetime relationship between adoptive parents, birthparents, and a child. Before you take Susan Burns' advice, think about how you'll feel about what you've done when your child is twenty, and her birthparents get to explain everything that happened when she was born. Ethics are important, not just for birthparents, but for the adopting family and the adopted child."
1,Horrifying,"As a future adoptive parent, I would prefer to have an ethical adoption. Not swindle a vulnerable woman out of her baby. This book is appalling. I am sad for the author's adoptive child. Clearly the author cares not for her child's best interests."
1,Fast Track Adoption,This book is extremely disturbing. To write a book on how to swindle and con a mother out of a child! She is acting like she is looking to buy a dog or something! Very disturbing.
3,At least the production is decent for once,"It's definitely good to hear a Venom cd that is actually produced. Cronos is definitely missed, however the songs here are quite good, if not entirely black metal, and new singer Demolition Man has a powerful voice and a worthy successor. His bass playing as well is a step-up in technique from Cronos, being almost Geddy Lee-ish (but not quite, of course) in the opening of the title track. The high points are the title track--which is bangin' melodic power metal--and Blackened Are the Priests, which reminds one of the satanic themes of old, but without the frantic, noisy backdrop. The band's attempt at Sabbath's 'Megalomania' is ludicrous without the entire first half of the song.Parasite and Skeletal Dance are the next in line as favorites, being killer exercises in thrash. Great album by a band that wants to progress and not rest on its laurels."
3,decent,"This is not a bad album, but i'm not sure what the band is trying to be. It's not thrash really, and it's definitely not black metal (an undefined concept to be sure - it's been 8 years since the big ""black metal"" craze and I STILL don't know what it is exactly - and I used to publish an underground zine), I would probably label it hard 80s type metal not unlike Twisted Sister or early Motley Crue. The silliness of a band like TS is not prevalent on this record, but I think you get the idea.This is not a very informative review, I know, but let's just say that my girlfriend liked this a whole lot more than I did. I think this is decent yet uninspired 80's metal, nothing more. Even with my limited exposure to Venom, I am quite certain that this album does not represent the band's sound as a whole."
2,"Good Start, But Needs Work","This is a silly album -- fun, but not earth-shaking. This band is fun to see live. I mean, how many times do you get to see someone take a power drill to a Barbie? But as a recording act, Billygoat needs two things: songs, and better production.The highlight of the LP is their cover version of ""Love Power"" from the old ""Producers"" movie. It's much funnier than anything they come up with. The silliness of ""Gorillas and Bananas"" is too uncomfortably close to the over-the-top shctick that Tom Green specializes in, for my taste. ""L. Ron's Army"" is funnier in concept than execution, being a lame swipe at Scientology.If Rosemary's Billygoat can write better songs, they might wind up in playing halls instead of little nightclubs. This album is for fans only."
1,Nearly impossible to follow,"This is my first review on Amazon ever, I feel so adamantly about the horrible quality of this book that I needed to share.The author does an extremely poor job of introducing concepts and making them easy to understand. Problems are CONSTANTLY laid out in a manner where leaps are made between steps without explanation.The ""myeconlab"" supplement is supposed to walk through solutions from the book but instead only offers multiple choice ""quizzes"" that are much different.Of course many of you will not have a choice in the matter if it is required for the course but what a P.O.S.....worst way to spend $200."
3,an average economics book,I used this as a textbook in one of my classes. Its confusing at times but the contents will guide you through it. Make sure that you understand all the material to succeed in your reading b/c this is not a book that you can pick up and start reading fron chapter 8.
3,Perloff Micoeconomics 5th Edition,"If you are looking for a book that will actually help you learn Economics keep looking. I found the concepts densely couched in graphs of kilograms of hogs and pigs. I know that did not make a lot of sense, but it's all a bit hard to follow. The book jumps from definitions into abstract scenarios. Economics in general is abstract thinking about how and why people spend money, but this book loses that explanation someplace between the intro and the back cover. Reading text over and over again is not my thing. Maybe the 6th Edition will be better. I often wonder about why there are so many editions of textbooks. Did they leave something out, or come up with something new?"
1,the worst microeconomics textbook i have ever read,"very confusing, non-focusing writing style plus author's splurge of mathematical demonstrations everywhere in the book makes this text book very hard to understand and offers no help for people to grasp the beauty of the economic theory."
1,Not this...,"I really looked forward to this collection. But like many books of Korean ficiton, inept translation made it unreadable.Why does it seems that only Kevin O'Rourke (Our Twisted Hero, Ten Korean Short Stories, a lot of poetry) can translate Korean?If you're interested in a well-translated, canonical collection try Ten Korean Short Stories (republished as A Washed Out Dream). And read Our Twisted Hero while you're at it."
3,OK Intro to Augustine,"This 3 hour cassette program will give the listener a very basic biography and introduction to St. Agustine of Hippo. Beginning with his life as a young man and taking us through his death, the set (narrated by Charlton Heston) interweves the development of Augustinian philosophy and theology with his life to show, with some effectiveness, the impacts of one on the other. I will agree with other reviewers that the narration by Heston is execellent, while the accented St. Agustine has the potential to make you laugh out loud. Additionally, this wasn't riveting in content, but does give enough of a taste to be worthwhile listening to during your commute."
4,Amazing content and concert! Poor quality DVD image.,"Content: Let me start by saying that I am a very recent fan of TBM, but I love their music. The concert is amazing to watch. Everyone on stage contributes to their great performances. It's just amazing to watch this band be so into their music.Sound: Great Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, it really is like you are there. Crowd noise during performances is kept a very minimum allowing you to enjoy their live sound.Image: This DVD looks only acceptable on my 100"" screen. Granted it's not a blu-ray, but this DVD exhibits lots of banding and macroblocking issues. Reds especially seem to be extra blocky throught their performances.There is decent detail we can see in Chibi's tattos and hair, but it does leave something to be desired as far as the quality goes.If you are a fan, this DVD is a must OWN!"
3,Amazing group; mediocre DVD,"Let's face it: if you're interested in this DVD, you're probably already a fan of TBM. You and I both love them and their songs. I'm not here to review the band itself. They'd get 5 stars all day and night if that were the case.This DVD though, is not great my any means. The performance given by the band is quite good, but the quality of the footage is unsatisfactory if I'm being completely honest. When you buy a DVD of anything, you expect a certain level of video quality. This disc falls short. At first I thought it was just because I was viewing it on my 55"" HDTV, but it still looked quite poor when viewed on my modest 24"" computer monitor. I'm often staring at a blurry, blocky mess of pixels. I greatly wish this show was shot with better equipment (or converted to DVD properly - I'm not sure what exactly is at fault).With that said, I'm still ok with having bought it. TBM fans take whatever they can get of these guys."
2,Unsympathetic readings by Vanska,"I've heard a number of recordings by Vanska that I like, but I think there are many better recordings of Nielsen's 3rd and 4th. In the 4th, Vanska attempts to use fast tempos and a vehement and blustery approach to wring extra drama from the work, but instead only manages to miss the depth, grandeur, and excitement that it naturally conveys under other conductors. The music ends up seeming somewhat trivialized. Likewise, I don't understand why in the 3rd symphony, called the ""Expansiva,"" and in its second movement, called a ""pastorale,"" it is necessary to rush breathlessly through, again missing the ""expansiveness"" that was surely intended. Vanska's recording of Nielsen's 1st is excellent, making it all the harder to understand why here he just doesn't seem in sympaty with the music. Rozhdestvensky, Chung, Blomstedt, and others do better with it."
5,A really good book for new writers,"This book is very useful for student writer groups! I had worn out the exercises in THE CRAFT OF POETRY; this book has maybe a couple of hundred exercises, some in a special section and some at the end of each chapter. The exercises are fun and productive, mostly easier than those in THE CRAFT OF POETRY, and they are in several genres. I am glad I found this."
3,Had promise...,"This is the only Dallas Schulze book I've read, so I didn't know what to expect. I did like the story, although I felt like Matt and Jessie fell in love way too quickly. I liked how we got the story about Dana and Reilly also. What bugged me was the writing. There were many grammar and typographical errors, and I also thought that there were inconsistencies in the story, like Jessie's tendency to talk ""a mile a minute"" or ""babble"" - and these characteristics were mentioned by Matt - but yet Matt likes how she can sit quietly and doesn't need to talk. I suppose you can be a person who does both of those things, but they occurred pretty close to each other in the book, so it was noticeable. I also agree with another reviewer who said that the characters seemed like they all had the same characteristics/personality. It's an ok read, just not spectacular."
5,An eye-opener to the real world,"This book was extremely interesting for me, but I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone. I would recommend it however to those interested in the Health/Science industry. The read isn't so hard but does require a basic understanding of some medical terminologies and you have to be able to pick things up and follow ideas easily. The book reads almost like a horror story, except its true. I wouldn't recommend reading this book if you get paranoid easy. I know I usually don't, but even I find myself thinking twice about alot of things now. This book gets a high rating from me because, as a studying pre-medical student, it has helped me to find my area of interest in the field."
4,Hard drive replacement,It was very easy to replace this drive in a Motion Computing tabletWork great and would recommend
5,"60GB IDE Toshiba 1.8"" MK6006GAH-Great Product",I purchased this to replace my 30gig Fujitsu Lifebook P1610 HDD and it works and fits perfectly...FYI: This is not a ZIF drive and It will not work with the Fujitsu Lifebook P1620 or P1630.
5,Old iPod Lives Again!,"First the battery died on my six-year-old 4G iPod 40GB, then the hard drive suffered the clicks-of-death. The battery was cheap, but this 60GB drive was a bit pricey. Both were very easy to install, though, and now the iPod can hold my entire CD library. If I get another six years out of it, I'll be thrilled.One installation note, if anyone is buying this drive for the same purpose: one of the drive's keyed guide holes (they're on either side of the connector pins) had a plastic plug inserted that prevented the connector from being attached. Once I pried this out with a sewing pin, everything fit together perfectly."
3,good bond film but...,"The audio quality is poor.Im looking forward for another release,digitally remastered in 5.1 audio or DTS."
4,A classic bond movie that has a touch of brown sugar.,A bond movie that is easily one of the best. Moore does an excellent job despite his age.
5,Very Good,Great! The only thing that I still haven't got use to the menu at the front instead of playing the movie without having to make choice first.
3,good but not the product in the add,"Again, this was the rite movie, but the wrong edition from what the picture showed. Thank you though for a good product, and a fair price."
3,okay Bond Film,octopussy was good Bond film worth the rented at your video store. Iam a very huge Bond fan i can't wait for the new Bond Film in the series.
3,"Good, but it's still a Moore movie","It's OK, but doesn't rank too high in the Bond films, in my opinion."
3,to bad nobody did it better,having all the potencial of being a good picture octopussy fails on all levels first it suffers from bad acting axcept for louis jordan who along with exotic localls saves this picture from a 2 star rating second a weak plot something that also killed moon raker also roger moore was far to old to play bond by this point why he wasint replaced is anyones guess a problem that killed another bond picture a veiw to a kill.
3,"Not horrible, but&#65533;","I don't think this movie is as good as people say it is. Moore is getting to be too old to look the part, and though Maud Adams is beautiful, her role is too small and stupid. She had a much better part in The Man With the Golden Gun. What can I say about that tarzan yell?"
1,It was not good!!,Octopussy was possibly one of the worst movies (Bond) ever made! I was completely aghast with the film's lack of interest. It seemed as if Roger Moore was trying to hard to be Sean Connery.
1,Worst Bond movie EVER,"I have sat through this piece of thrown together garbage several times and I still can not tell you what this movie is about. The part where Moore shots ""SIT"" to the angry tiger and then swings away with a Tarzan yelp says it all - this movie sucks!"
5,The best Bond for a Friday night,"After a long week, it is time for a relaxing weekend--and no better way to kick it off by watching this particular Bond film on Friday night.""Octopussy"" is one of the best bonds. It has beautiful on-location scenes in India and Germany. It has an intriguing villian. It has an exceptional plot--better formed than some of the other films. It also has an exciting climax as Bond races to disarm a nuclear bomb and a thrilling last action scene where Bond holds onto an airplane high in the sky! It also has a great song theme, ""All Time High"" by Rita Coolidge.I loved it."
4,"Brilliantly complex plot, mired by goofy action...","""Octopussy"" is a wonderfully entertaining film, with a fabulous twist that elevates it to a first-rate cold war thriller. Bond acts like a dork in a few scenes, but as the film progresses Moore gets more serious and really pulls off a great performance.Maud Adams give Moore his best romance, and John Barry proves once again why he's the greatest composer working in films. Fabulous opening song and title sequence... they don't make 'em like this anymore."
4,A nifty little addition to the series,"Released in 1983, Roger Moore's sixth outing as James Bond is a sterling example of everything we've come to expect from the post-Connery 007 franchise: It's got plenty of cheesy one-liners, rollicking action sequence, plenty of fancy gadgets, a nifty little car chase, a series of pretty ladies, and a veritable gardening club of evil villains who've worked up a diabolical (if needlessly convoluted) scheme that involves everything from Faberge Eggs to nuclear devices to a traveling circus. Moore is his typically suave, smug, sarcastic self, wisecracking his way through the adventure with a certain amiable pomposity. He's no match for Sean Connery's lethal cool, but he certainly is a lot of fun. In a way, that's the best way to sum up Octopussy's appeal: It isn't a classic in the same sense as Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, and Dr. No, but it's still a fantastic action movie, and a fine addition to any Bond lover's collection."
2,Espionage and Slapstick,"""Octopussy"" (1983) suffers from the same kitchen-sink approach that brought down ""Moonraker."" Despite a few impressive action sequences, this 007 caper remains as tired as Roger Moore's aging spy. The Ian Fleming spirit that briefly resurfaced in ""For Your Eyes Only"" has vanished. Instead, we're back to the slapstick silliness and lackluster villains of earlier Moore outings. Though an EON production, ""Octopussy"" was far less Bondian than Sean Connery's unofficial ""Never Say Never Again."""
3,Very entertaining Bond film,"People always seem to write hate about Roger Moore continuing as James Bond into the 80's. They say he was too aged and it just didn't work for a James Bond film. I disagree, this film may seem silly but I have never thought of it as bland. It places James Bond in a later period of his life, which is something that would be unheard of in modern Bond movies, an older Bond whhhaaaa??? Many reviewers seem to forget, this movie still made more money then Never Say Never Again, Sean Connery's return as Bond. So obviously it isn't as bad as Never Say Never Again was, because that was a terrible film."
5,Classic James Bond!,"Roger Moore was heading toward the end of his James Bond days but he had the energy to pull another thriller for moviegoers and for those fans who caught this on DVD! Maud Adams and Louis Jourdan played their roles in quite a convincing fashion.Thrills and excitement await you with ""Octopussy""!"
2,mediocre and exaggerated rehash,"I must admit that I found this to be vintage Moore: campy, never believable, full of slapstick, and consistently over the top. This is Bond reduced to formula: bad guy, sexy girls, fights in weird locales, and no genuine emotion whatsoever. I once enjoyed things like this, but now find them boring and a waste of time. I know lots of people like Moore and it is OK if you accept it for what it is - fun junk.But then, I never could accept any other Bond after the Connery era, which made the adventure somewhat believable and with more subtle humor.Recommended if you know you like Moore, but if you are hoping for something a little better, forget it."
5,The BEST 007 Film Ever!,"This is the best 007 film ever! This movie has everything you need & want! Cubby, John Glen & Roger Moore are at their best! In this film they got the ""007 Blueprint"" correct, some serious, some fantasy. Its just perfect!The Big 3 knew they were up against Sean Connery's Never Say Never Again. They destroyed him!The Big 3 knew & never shy away from George Lucas, Speilberg, Stallone, Eddie Murphy & other's major major hits! They used to release Roger's 007 against them & they would hold their own!I do wish on the DVD Package they allowed Roger to do commentary tracks & somemore documentaries. But that is really for all of the 007 dvd's."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:One of the sillier Bonds, Octopussy features (obviously) a ridiculous title, Bond in clown makeup, an unimpressive story and an over-the-hill Roger Moore; watch the previous entry, For Your Eyes Only, instead of taking a slice of this turkey."
5,Both touching and hillarious,"I picked up this book a few weeks ago at the urging of some friends. Not quite sure what to expect, I found myself glued to the book. At times it's laugh out loud funny (the subway people thought the guy giggling at a book was a weirdo), romantic, and sometimes sadly truthful. It's a true telling of one man's funky quest to find what works for him and what doesnt. It's told with an outlook and unique insight into the non traditional thinker's head and truly asks and answers the question; what do you want to be when you grow up?This read is an adventure and a half!Highly reccomended"
4,Simple and Perfect,"Joshua's writing style is very down to Earth, he gives you the most basic detail of characters to give you an open mind to fill in the other details that don't necessarily need to be informed in such a detail that other authors have been known to do. Follow Joshua as he goes around the World and practice/compete in some of the most bizarre sports in the world. There is no predicting what Joshua will do in this random filled novel. If you like to plan out the entire book after only reading the first chapter then this won't be the book for you. There is so much that happens in this book that makes the average mind wonder and think ""But why would he do that?"" it is truly a mind thinker in so many good ways."
5,Giving geeks around the world hope for a better future,"A quick read; fun and emotionally transparent. Our little hero graces his way through eccentric adventure after eccentric adventure, all the while proving that even the least talented among us can be champions (or at least, very nearly so). There is a tenderness in this book. In its Quixotic madness, it transports us into worlds of danger, adventure, greatness, and saunas in Finland. A true story of sporadic unshakeable dedication and glorious redemption...and courage. The Underdog clearly underscores the ideal: it's not whether you win or lose, it's how many fat guys you can yank by the g-string. A great read."
5,"Laugh-Out-Loud-Funny, Clever, Touching, and Relevant","From the moment I read the first three pages of the introduction I was hooked. This book speaks of and to the American spirit with humor and wit. Not only did I laugh out loud every time I opened it, but I cried a few times too. It's the kind of book that you read so fast because it is so good, but you don't want to so that it will last longer.If you are looking for a book that inspires you through narrative and challenges you to go beyond your day-to-day life, or, if you want a hilarious window into the zany life of some ""average"" Americans, look no further. We are told to follow our dreams in a culture that is not set up to handle it when all of us do. This book is for us an answer to that problem. I look forward to many more insightful books from this talented author."
3,Crazy Dude,"This author sent me an invitation to be his amazon friend. Hello! All of my reivews are bitter and sarcastic, why would I want to buy your book? Maybe I should you spam about ""enlargement"" products. How would you like that? The book might be a great story. Frankly, I don't care! I would rather read a book about the mating rituals of worms than me spammed by an author that wants me to buy his book."
5,"Yes. yes, yes.","This is a wonderful, simple book of the mostauthentic Italian pasta sauces you will find.The author is English, but has lived in Italy for many years.Having also traveled to Italy, I can attest to theauthenticity of the recipes--I make them and they takeme back to harborside trattorias. These recipesare not for people who enjoy Chef Boyardee Spaghetti andMeatballs--they are for people who enjoyed the movie""Big Night."" Most recipes are healthy in the Mediterraneanstyle--but many are decidedly not low fat. My onlysuggestion would be to include lower fat ingredientalternatives, but you can do that yourself."
5,I'd give it six stars if I could!,"Simply the best cookbook I own. This is what Italian cooking is all about. Simple, unpretentious, delicious, and fun. This is how Italian families eat. I love the ""peasant"" dishes. There are too many fantastic recipes to mention just one. The penne and cauliflower is one that stands out as unusual and FANTASTIC! My wife and I just pick out a recipe, put on some music, light some candles, pour some chianti, and make a date of it. I cannot say enough about this book. If you're considering a cookbook on Italian food, DON'T HESITATE! Thank you Diane Seed."
2,Not the best cookbook ever...,"Although the recipes in this book are relatively straightforward, they just don't produce the most flavorful sauces. I have tried quite a few of the recipes and none of them has really produced a sauce I was thrilled with. I have tried recipes for the same sauces out of other cookbooks (especially Marcella Hazen's Classic Italian Cooking) and invariably liked the results better. I really wouldn't recommend this one."
5,Indispensible,"Years ago I got this book cheap where I worked. I thought that maybe I could use some of the ideas in it. I tried many of the recipes and loved them. The treatment of pasta sauce is so much simpler, and makes better strategic use of the ingredients. Then my former roommate swiped the book when she moved out. I'm going to have to replace it now, so I can figure out real bolognese again. ;)"
2,Ricther's The Town is a Sleeper,In Conrad Richter's The Town he keeps his story focused on Sayward and the rest of the Wheeler family. He really starts to focus on Chancey and the change that takes place within him. The Town is a very dry and boring book that does not really interest me. The book does not really have a huge climax either that makes you want to keep reading. Overall i would not recommend the book for college students.
2,not an interesting read,"The Town is a story of a family trying to mend with the new world that is slowly thriving around them. The main idea is Sayward's adjustment to the new and improving town.She's finding it hard because she doesn't find the new world as great as the rest of her fellow townsmen do. Although her kids and husband are adjusting, she just isn't. I look for a book with a certain indulgence of action, this makes me want to read and never put it down. This book did the exact opposite of that, it could have been better if there were a better climax so you would want to keep reading."
1,"Odd Colors, Lots Of Pieces","We wanted to buy Candyland for our almost 3 year old boy. He really liked Pooh and Tigger so we thought this game would be great for him.However, the colors on this game make it nearly impossible to play for a 3 year old. He understand colors like red, green, and blue. This game has colors like mauve, turqouise, and tan. And to make it even more difficult, the shade of colors on the cards doesn't match the shade of colors on the board.Plus all the pieces make it time-consuming to put up and take down.We took this game back. Do yourself a favor and buy the plain-old traditional Candyland."
3,"Oh, Bother","I am a big fan of the Candyland game and was excited to find a 100 Acre Wood version. My 4 year old likes it, but it is a bother to set up and take down. We often find ourselves playing it without the standing characters, though it's not as much fun. The colors are not especially helpful, as they are odd shades of turquoise, pink, etc. We sometimes have to take the card over to the light to figure out if it's pink or orange. The good news is, my daughter gets very excited about drawing the cookie or cupcake cards, even though they mean she has to go back near the beginning."
2,Not happy with this game.,"I wasn't sure about the game before I bought it, and now that I own it. I really dislike it!This is why:The game looks more like a Winnie the Pooh Birthday Party than a Picnic.The gameboard feels very cluttered with all of the winnie the pooh cardboard standing parts.The gameboard is even worse because because the colored squares seem extra small, and the playing pieces are extra big.Eeyore, if placed on the board with his head facing forward, will take up 3 spaces.The colors are not simple colors making the teaching value of this game very poor.I suggest buying the original game, because this one is truly not that good."
2,Pooh Lover but not this game!!,"My 4 & 2 1/2 year olds love Pooh but this game is not what I expected. There are MANY pieces that pop into the board to decorate it and they get in the way of the game. But my biggest complaint of this game is the colors. They are NOT your traditional Red, Oragne, Blue, Yellow, Purple, Green they are in between colors like yellow-orange, grenish-blue, orange-red etc. YIKES!! I am trying to teach my kids the colors as we play the game and I have trouble naming the colors. I donated my Pooh game and bought the regular Candy Land!! The colors are more vibrant and not mistakable for another color!!"
4,OK game,"This game is not bad but I would recommend the original version. The pieces in this game are too big. Having played the traditional one as a kid I wish I would have just gotten it. Overall it is not a bad game, just not as good as the other."
2,Not as useful as we thought...,"I bought this for my almost 2-1/2 year old, to help her learn colors. The colors on this board are not standard colors - teal, fushia, tan, etc. - so it is not as useful as we thought it would be. It is a bother to set up and take apart. She clamours to play it, but she doesn't have the attention span...She just wants to play with the cards, which get bent and torn. She doesn't care about the game itself at all."
5,pooh candyland game,really fast delivery! item just as pictured. thanks so much! a really fun game to play too!
1,Another dumb luck game,"Boring. Try some of the Ravensberg games insted. Games for kids are luck, but this is even worse. Can be frustrating for them too."
5,"Works perfectly, matches perfectly","This was a great bargain, it matched the OEM mirror exactly, and has worked flawlessly for me for several years. Highly recommended."
2,A Bit Disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed with Grandmother and I. It's a sweet and sentimental book, which is fine, but it elevates the love of a grandparent over the love of a parent or sibling. A child should not have to find fault with a parent, sibling, or friend in order to see how special Grandma is."
3,great ingredients but not quite emiril dish,"DVD: Don't Look Now:Assuming you want horror/suspense, you could not have fineringredients. Great actors, author(s), cinematography, Venicescenes, psychic phenomena. But, (besides a little toomuch butt) the continuity just was'nt there in our opinion.Lovely boats tho.Twoseniorcitizens"
1,Don't Look Now,"I've Never Rated Or Commented On A Movie, On Any Site...Ever, But This Movie Was So HORRIBLE (-5 Stars) I Must Warn Others. Much Of The Dialogue Is In Italian Without Any Translation Which Is Not Only Frustrating, But Also ANNOYING. Nothing Happening Appears To Have Anything To Do With Anything Else Happening In The Film And Simply Makes NO SENSE...Absolutely None. The Plot Isn't Revealed/Come Together At The End NOT B/C It's Abstract, But B/C There Simply Is No Plot. The Viewer...I, Was Left With Just One Big Unassociated Mess.Did I Mention It Was Horrible?"
2,Slow.....,"It's bad, when about halfway through the movie, I wanted it to end. I don't mind a slow movie if it leads up to something incredible. The ending was NOT scary, and it was so anti-climatic that I was expecting more. THIS IS IT????Positives:Some good suspense, which seemingly had nothing to do with the story..Julie Christie nakedI'm not a fan of gore or anythign like that, I really do like a good suspenseful movie. This one just does not deliver."
4,review,Very interesting suspense thriller from the beginning to the end. I recommend to anyone who has not seen it. thanks
4,"Nicholas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now""","Based on a short story by Daphne du Maurier, ""Don't Look Now"" is a truly creepy and totally engrossing dark thriller set in Venice. Shades of ""Exorcist"" and ""Fallen,"" but with several psychic twists that will stay with you for days. Also has a nicely realized love scene with Christie and Sutherland. The first time I saw the movie I walked home from the theater in a blizzard, almost in a trance... One of my favorites."
2,I Don't Get Why This is a Horror Movie....?,"2 stars because I like the acting of Sutherland and Christie. And the scenes of Venice were lovely. Other than that I really don't get whats supposed to be the point of this movie. The ending left me going ""huh?...."". Maybe this one was over my head but I have no idea how the rest of the movie had to do with the death of the daughter. Or why the two creepy old sisters were so interested in the couple. The only interesting element was the husbands unexplained sighting of his wife when she was supposed to be out of the city. But it wasn't emphasized nor seem to have any relation to the jumbled collection of seemingly unrelated, though beautiully filmed!- scenes of the movie. Was I supposed to be scared or feeling dread? I dunno, I was mostly entertained with the shots of Venice."
4,Very good.,"Finally got around to seeing this film after half watching it a year ago. Very impressed. My kind of film.Has you guessing what's going on until the finale which for me was unexpected and very creepy.Only problem with the film the subtitles didn't work so missed a lot of dialogue both english and italian as my TV does not feature the best sound.Sex scene would have been shocking back then, very nice scene, I like sex scenes in non-porn films."
1,Don't Look Now,"It's A Shame That The Product Is Allowed To Be Sold In The United States, A Person Isn't Told About Non-USA Format. A Sales Person Informed Me That This Certain Movie Would In Fact Play On The DVD That I Already Have At Home. I Got The Movie And Found Out That It Didn't Play On A Standard DVD. So I Was Stuck With Paying Shipping Charges To Return The Movie."
4,thrilling dark long 70's horror suspence at is best.,"Donald sutherland finest horror performance you must discover. Might be long sometime cause of is foreign situation in Venice. If you liked sutherland in (invasion of the body snatchers, 1978) you'll love that one too. It's a rare horror thriller that people of this generation forgot about. One of the must shocking ending i ever saw in a horror suspence movie with a cool old thrilling music."
5,Don't Look Once,"A film which manages to be both deeply moving and intensely chilling throughout. As both a gothic horror and a study of human grief, ""Don't Look Now"" offers up a vision of end-of-season Venice that is both sombre and sinister. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play a couple visiting Venice after the accidental death of their young daughter. Both actors are truly believable, and their love scene is one of the most touching and erotic you will ever see. Sutherland is haunted by fleeting glimpses of a small, red cloaked figure amongst the alleyways and canals, and the plot itself has as many twists and turns as the city in which it is set. Fine acting, an emotionally resonant score from Pino Donaggio and inspired direction on the part of Nicholas Roeg make this an unforgettable masterpiece. It is no exaggeration to say that the penultimate scene is one of the most chilling ever made, but a second viewing reveals the poignancy behind the horror."
1,worst movie purchase ever,"I enjoy all types of movies yet this one is just lame, check it out well before you buy"
1,Don't look now...or you'll be bored to death,"The famous ""encounter"" between Christie and Sutherland aside...well, I remember seeing this movie with a number of my friends when it first came out...and about half way through it, we started making up our own plot just to keep awake. I don't want to give away the ending, but ...well, at least we got a good laugh from that. Otherwise, it's a great cure for insomnia."
1,Striking a happy medium....,It was scary in 1973.In 2010 it was scaringly dreadful tripe.I actually found myself wondering whether Sutherland used a stunt bum.
4,"Enjoyable, artsy spook fest","I love this film. First of all, it's set in Venice. I warn you it's a slower paced, oddball sort of scary movie. But the story and interesting film making were I think way ahead of their time. My only complaint is that it's a little long. Diehard classic horror buffs should enjoy this."
1,Cant i choose no Stars!!!,"This film contains 101 minutes of completely irrelevant object close ups and dodgy tash's. A completely laughable film if viewed by anyone under the age of 20. Its not scary, its not intelligent and the best bit is a completely inept main character swinging from a rope.Why?"
4,Nicely Done,"Film studies people are absolutely crazy about this picture; and they have good reason to be. Wonderfully different with a VERY CLEVER and tragic ending. It came out in the same your, I belive, as Cabaret ... which apparently film buffs hate (I really like Cabaret).Strong atomosphere, tense subject matter. I did not care for the characters at all though, so the story is the focus."
3,For ages 2-3,"The book itself is ok but for my 2,5 year old son was too late (it says it's for ages 4 and up). At this age they understand everything showed in the book but they are old enough to resist potty training voluntarily for their own reasons. If your baby was not introduced to potty training at all- you might want to consider this book. But if you already started some basics- it's too late for this book.About the seller- it took forever to receive it and some pages were dirty."
4,detailed account of a journalist view of Island infantry warfare,I was seeking information regarding Thomas J. J. Christian's involvement as a fighter/bomber pilot in the Solomon Island area. Guadalcanal Diary provide some information from a Marine Corps infantryman's perspective. I would recommend the book.
2,Guadalcanal Diary,Written in the make believe style of 60 years ago where everyone died cleanly with a smile on their face.
5,Glad I wasn't there,"God bless the United States Marine Corp,and every soldier who fought for our freedom.That's what I got out of this book.Courage,love of country and brotherhood.We can all learn from this book."
4,Diary,Good information but not as detailed as I would have liked. It is a diary so it is not real exciting.
5,Prompt Service,"Book was delivered promptly. I had no problems with order, service, or product. Completely satisfied."
2,Omitted all Photographs and Maps!,"Guadalcanal Diary now sold by Modern Library as Hardcover is an all print softcover with a hardbound cover. Shame on Randomhouse for their cheap Subsidiary version from Modern Library's reprint of this Classic. Had I known this book came without the photo's and maps I would not have purchased it. We waited 7 months for backorder and is needed for college report so we can't return it this late in the game. Find an edition with photographs and maps included!!John P Patterson NYC, NY"
2,disappointed in the recent publications of diary,"when i was a young man my father gave me a copy of Guadalcanal Diary and i literally wore it out, and in fifty years it has gonei purchased a new copy in the hardbound editionno photosno indexno bibliographyonly the minimum of print to enable it to be publishedreally disappointed that this great manuscript was treated so badlya very very close friend of my Dad, Ken Bailey was included in the book as he won the MOHone more thing i am not critical of the authors words only in how the publisher cheaped out the book"
5,Pure Genius,"Professor Ehret's insights on fasting and how the body heals itself is second to none, and the scientific way in which he teaches you how to allow your body to heal itself is priceless.If you need to heal yourself or others this little book is a treasure you must not overlook!!!"
3,Look For Better Choice,"The basic idea of avoiding certain foods that aren't good for the body is worthwhile. However, the book rambles in information that isn't that helpful. The key is eating more vegetables and fruits and avoiding mucus causing foods. An internet search may give you the quick information of this and you can skip this book. Also, books that deal with getting rid of inflamation in the body will be helpful. It is amazing how many diseases and ailments can be healed by changing what we eat... choose well for a healing fountain of youth!"
5,A must read and practise book,"The book is purely based on author's personal experience .Hence,it is reliable.Infact,it has changed my perception about nutrition and I have started adopting the teachings of Arnold Ehret.A must read and practise book."
2,Effects on Steve Jobs,"I did the Muscusless Diet for about 1 year in my early 20s. I lost energy and returned to eating meat. So maybe my body chemistry requires it. Not sure how long Steve Jobs practiced Ehrets teachings. I've always wondered whethered the over consumption of fruit overworked his pancreas leading to his early death? From the paleodiet persepctive, it seems that obtaining fruit would have been rare on a weekly, monthy, yearly basis. On top of that fruit is always seasonal and spoils quickly. So even a semi-regular diet of it seems unlikely and therefore unnatural. Fasting is however, very common! Who knows more of the details of Steve's pancreas problems? I wonder if the Ehret Health Club or Publishing Group will be asked to defend Jobs health? Their website doesn't have an open nor unmoderated blog."
3,"I mean, it's awesome, but looking back, it didn't change my life","I don't think you need to here more from me about the book, cuz lots of people seem to have that covered. What I WILL say about this book is that it was no life-changer. And I got a thing for life changers. I'd recommend just reading the wikipedia entry on Arnold Ehret and doing a Blessed Herbs colon cleanse.But you gotta do you."
4,New Perspective on health,Ehert utlises a very unconventional approach to wellness that is very simple and basic. This book has served as a useful pivot in my journey to wellness. Though written in the early 1900's many of Eherts's concepts are still expoused today in writings on the acidic/alkaline relationship to disease. Would encourage readers to approach with an open mind. The results I have had from this program have far exceeded any of the conventional kind.
4,Thanks Arnold,"In first reading I hade problems to digest and accept author ideas. I think that the most denying part was in my mind. Because of lack of other joys, it made wrong food us something very satisfying and needed. Medicine for different depressions formed in everyday life tasks. After ""master cleanser"" diet (fast), which was not so positive for me and reading book again I found my understanding to reach deeper levels of food story. This system is also body friendly and teaches to be sensitive with what is going on in you. Author is maybe a little too sure in his expositions, but anyway, this book is a definitive push for me in improving my living and health."
3,"Interesting read, somewhat outdated.","I follow a relatively strict, vegan eating regime, so his method is not even as strict as mine. If you are trying to make a change from the average american, carnivore way of eating, this is not the book for you. Read it only if you are very serious and dedicated about your diet and nutritional habits."
5,Natural Healing,Too much white flour products and white sugar creates an overload of mucus in the system. Then your body is to acidic and diseased!
5,Ehret,"To many, many if not all of Ehrets' works are Bibles of Authority.Tread wisely and lightly.Arnold Ehret is a true leader and master in his field, but for many his field is a field of misery and misunderstanding.Use what you can and leave the rest, there is plently to learn from this master and plently to overturn.His agenda was to get well, and with that in mind you cannot go wrong, but it takes diligent hard work and sacrifice and thats the rub...!Enjoy!"
3,"Wonderful rejuvenating effects, but not a normal diet",I believe that the Mucusless Diet is a cleansing diet and not one that most people do well on permanently. It's a diet that one should use temporarily to possibly correct a health condition. I do not agree with his theory that eating protein is not healthy. It's a shame that Professor Ehret died at such a early age (from an unfortunate head injury) because it would have been interesting to see how long he would have lived.
1,Self-delusion not research,The author misinterprets her own data. I'm certain she must be an adopter who resents the possibility of renion between her adoptee and his/her mother. This book was obviously biased and extremely flawed.
4,ShelleyII: The Middle of My Century,Have not read the book as yet but am facinated by Shelly Winters. The service and speed in receiving my order was excellent
3,arrived broken.,"This arrived broken due to the fact that the box was too small for the product. that is poor packaging. I am not sure if this is an amazon packing problem or the company who made the jam. I'm sad because I really wanted to try this.Gave a 3 star review because a replacement was not available. Why not? it's still for sale.Amazon did refund my money, but it was a waste of my time during the entire process ."
5,"Very deep, thoughtful and enlightening!",I found the book to be very useful in helping me understand why I do things that are destructive to myself and to others. The author gives very logical and persuasive arguments along with research by other noted experts of human psychology and spirituality. It's a definite read if you are on a journey of spiritual enlightenment and personal and professional growth.
5,"For Survivors of Abuse, people who love them and everyone else!","This book is for survivors of sexual abuse, people who love and support them and everyone else. Marily is such an inspiration. I couldn't put it down, and I started telling my friends and family about it before I had finished.The first part of the book is a memoir, the last part is a combination of motivation, education and support. With chapters sbout how to talk to children, taking care in ""safe places"", seven things not to say to survivors and a message of hope, there is something here for everyone.I am also a survivor of incest. Marilyn's book gave me hope, and words to explain what I am dealing with. I learned things about protecting children that I had never heard or considered before.My book is heavily highlighted and will be read over and over. Get one for yourself and someone you love, you won't regret it."
5,Healing,"I, now, call this book my ""peace"". It has helped me ten-fold understand and begin healing my mind, body and spirit. It is a must read for those who are survivors and for those who are friends and family of those who are survivors. It helps me understand that what I have gone through, does not constitute ""crazy"" but rather what is to be expected of the experience. I would recommend this book for any and everyone who wants to truly understand."
5,Excellent resource,"This is a great book for both rape survivors and those who love them. This book talks about the social stigma over survivors, how they are not the ones who should feel shame, but those who abused them, helping rape and incest survivors understand they can be proud of the people they are. It also makes a beautiful connection that it doesn't matter what someone did to you, if it was a word, a touch, a brutal attack, it is how that interaction made you feel, how it hurt your spirit. This book does not minimize what happened to you and how that made you feel. It is a guide with eye opening stats, and useful advice to help protect children along with conversation starters. Even if you do not know anyone who has had this life experience, but unfortunately we all do, this is a great read for everyone to be better educated to support someone or prevent others from being hurt. Please read this book."
4,Miss America by Day: Lessons learned from Ultimate Betrayals and Unconditional Love,I have a friend that went through sexual abuse with your father and has been suffering from this all her life. It was good to read the book to be able to understand her better and also feel it would be a good book for those that have been sexually abused by their father or any other person. You realize that you are not alone and the book helps you to understand what you are going through and why you are feeling the way you do.
2,Save Your Time and Money - Just Read My Review,"Ross correctly points out that China is the subject of many concerns - growth in military spending, environmental degradation, resource acquisition, and loss of jobs in the U.S. He then goes on to assert (correctly, in my opinion) that the most telling development is that the number of foreign-sponsored R&D; centers in China has jumped from 200 to 600 between 2002 and 2004 - thus, China's impact will not be limited to low-end jobs, and can be expected to increase in impact.Finally, Ross goes on to provide evidence that the insecurity created for American employees by Chinese workers is also imposed upon current Chinese workers via those further inland who have not yet acquired jobs - eg. underemployed farmers and those thrown out of work by rationalization of formerly government employers.The bad news is that this pretty well sums up the book's 280+ pages. The good news is that having read this review, you no longer have any need to read it."
5,Greatest hits...,"Piano parts/vocals/and guitar chords for 22 Def Leppard hits, including 'Hysteria,' 'Tonight,' 'Love Bites,' and 'Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad.' Who says you can't rock out on the piano! The arrangements are for late intermediate to early advanced pianists."
2,only two things missing,"I bought this CD upon the recommendation of the other reviews for thisproduct-almost all five stars. I was truly anticipating a great CD having been a fan of ""americana"" since Gram Parsons, through Townes Van Zandt,toEmmy Lou and Lucinda, all the way up to people like Bonnie Prince Billy, M. Ward, Greg Brown and so on, but after listening to it I could not believe how pedestrian it is. Not that there is anything ""bad"" about this music but like Ryan Adams' music there is nothing here I haven't heard done better years ago. I would describe this music as Poco and/or Eagles inspired music(depending on the song) with a little Keith Richards guitar thrown in here and there. There are only two things lacking in this CD-Innovation and Inspiration. If this is ""Normal For Bridgewater"" I don't expect I will be headed there to listen to music anytime soon!"
2,Pleasant but empty,"As in all of Stephen Lawhead's novels, the strength here lies in the setting. Though I'm not expert enough to say whether he accurately depicted the Crusades, the scenes in the book evoke realistic images.The story has its merits, though there's not much to distinguish it from other 'quest' stories. Perhaps my memory is faulty but I recall 'Byzantium' to have had a much stronger plot. At times during the novel (particularly scenes with Emperor Alexius) I had to resist the urge to skip ahead. Looking back now I'm sorry I didn't. The scenes didn't convey any vital information and only served to disrupt the flow of the story.At the conclusion of the book it felt like I was reading a Horatio Alger novel. Our Hero gets the riches, gets huge tracts of land, and gets the girl, all by being honest and brave.Definitely not Lawhead's best work. Try the Empyrion books or the Albion trilogy for excellent fantasy."
3,Kept waiting for more...,"I've read a lot of historical fiction, and am still waiting for a writer who gives a balanced view of the Catholic Church during this period. Sheesh! Yes, the brutality was very real and the clergy was somewhat corrupt, but nowhere, other than the mystical Cele De, can the Crusaders catch a break in this book. The Catholic Church at this point was actually a boon to Western Civilization. In fact, some of the greatest minds in human history emerged at this time (Anselm, Bernard of Clairvaux, but you wouldn't know it from this.The grabbed my attention early but I kept waiting for a story that never really coalesced."
3,not bad,"Are you interested in the crusades? Do you enjoy stories that have to do with scotland, norway, ireland? Do you appreciate solid writing? If so, then this book may be of interest. After all, the crusades are the backdrop, the main character is from scotland, and the writing is solid.That being said, there is nothing particularly special about this book. As I said, the writing is solid, not spectacular. The characters are passable, but in a week you will not remember anything about them. In my opinion, the spirituality / theology aspects are weak and distract instead of enliven.However, if you are looking for something to read, then why not? The book is worth the money and you will not feel as if you have wasted your time."
3,"Volume 1, let's keep it that way","Lawhead has been writing worse and worse as the years go on. I don't know if he has gotten comfortable in his popularity, or what. His previous book was so boring that I returned it after the 3rd chapter.He fails to make things real to the reader. You're not really there, you don't understand the characters or feel their pain. It's very devoid of feeling or intrigue. There was way too much dialogue and not enough action. The action you do get shows woman's children getting butchered and drowned. Then it shows you in detail how they kill the woman. Sure, this all happened, but it doesn't really add to the story or to the character's development.I had to wade through the bland dialogue, weak action, and OK plot development. I don't want to know how he is going to make a series out of this. It was blah, why more? I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Fair to putrid,"This book definitely did not meet my expectations.For starters, I didn't find Murdo to be all that sympathetic a character. In fact, I was much more interested in the plight of his mother and girlfriend, left behind in the Orkneys to fend for themselves.Second, the whole turn-of-the-century, secret society plot twist was completely uninteresting and distracting from the main story line. It was tempting to keep turning the pages and skip over most of that stuff.Third, the portrayal of Emperor Alexius and the Byzantines is wildly inaccurate and biased.Fourth and lastly, the church characters such as the bishop and the abbot are portrayed as greedy, arrogant, treacherous and power hungry (qualities that certainly describe the Byzantines. Oh irony!). The western crusaders are also cartoon villains who are painted as either dullards and morons or pyschopathic, homicidal maniacs.Overall, unless you are a fanatic historical fiction reader I don't think you'll enjoy this book."
4,Vivid portrayal of colliding cultures,"Though not my favourite among Lawhead's works, the way he is able to put the reader *into* the setting is once again fantastic, almost cinematic (think OmniMax) in scope. Another repeat feature is the depiction of each culture through the eyes of the other: how Byzantines might have perceived the Germanic Crusaders, and vice-versa. It makes their motives more understandable to us in the end-20th century. Worth the money and the read, but don't stop here!"
3,Blockhead on Crusade,"Okay, is Celtic pronounced with a hard c or a soft c? If you answered hard, you are qualified to read this book. This was an interesting book, and I enjoyed it, but not enough to make me run out and buy the rest of the series. The main character, Murdo, is about as slow on the uptake as a chicken in an alligator ranch. I foresaw all the major plot twists (all two of them) just by reading the flysheet. Well, not quite, but Murdo fails to heed even the most blatant advice until practically the last page of the book. Then suddenly he becomes sly and cunning and rescues the day. And by the way, you can become as historically steeped in the crusades by reading The First Crusade, by Steven Runciman. Finally, two questions - why did the author choose the Orkneys, of all places, and why do so many reviewers think they are writing for the New York Times review of books?"
4,I pay attention to burners,"Dear sir! I am LE VAN LU, the researcher of HOSEI University in Tokyo Japan. I'd like to have this book Please reply and contact me Thank you very much!"
1,Where's the biography?,"I thought this was supposed to be a biography about Jimmy Stewart. I learned so little about him that I quit reading the book. The author, Donald Dewey, spent a vast amount of time on the town of Indiana, PA's quarrel over a museum. Mr. Dewey also spent more time writing about other people. I forgot who the book was about. I am so glad there are other biographies about Jimmy Stewart. His movies are such great entertainment, it would be a shame if this were the only biography to read."
2,James Stewart through the eyes of Donald Dewey,"Author Donald Dewey deliveres a very detailed description of James Stewart, but the book is not pure-it has a spin. Particular events in Mr. Stewarts life are amplified and opinionated with the author's twist. After reading the first 2 chapters of this book, it is clear to see that we are seeing the life of James Stewart through the eyes of Donald Dewey."
5,Great astronomical binoculars,"I have no comparable binoculars with which to compare this review, however these are functional and have good clarity. The first night I used them, I saw the moons of Jupiter. Nice, easy to use, user friendly instructions."
3,Surprisingly good remixes...,"Generally speaking, remixed versions of rock songs are a painful experience (just check out Pulp's This is Hardcroe remixes). So it was with some trepidation that I approached this single. However, I love the orginal song, one of the remixers was UNKLE, and having David Bowie's name on it didn't hurt either...so I gave it a try. Well, as it turns out, Bowie doesn't add much to the original song, except to add some polar-opposite backing vocals to Brina Molko's nasal lead. The UNKLE remix is quite good, as is the next one. Hell, even the 12-minute plus club mix is better than a lot of dance tracks out there. The fact that I can listen to this single - over 25 minutes of different versions of the same song - in one sitting without getting sick of it is a testament to the quality of the remixers (not ot mention the original song). As a bonus, there's some CD-rom stuff on here as well, with pictures of Placebo and Bowie performing together."
2,displeased,"it makes good rice, but water everwhere when finished..have used it 4 times..same thing every time..will never buy another steamer without looking at in store first...guess when u buy something for 30 dollars you get what you pay for...had a cheap rival that lasted 8 years tho"
5,High voltage interpreto-translation,"Without a shadow of the doubt this is most outstanding Oresteia I have ever read! Literal translation of great poetic art is a job for half-dead scholars, intended for half-dead readership, by delivering fully dead text. Hughes is a most lively, imaginative poet who rises to the task like no other. Indeed, the work could be described as bi-authored. It uniquely conveys the great Aeschylean art of condensing thought into a compelling, live image that immediately resonates with the reader/spectator. The economy and power of word is breath-stopping.I would give it more `stars' if I could. My only regret is that Hughes never took to Nietzsche; he would have been his most awesome translator!"
2,PROMISED LAND holds no promise,"I am just extremely! glad that I didn't start off my long road with SPENCER reading this book, because it would have been the last.I was not impressed. Maybe because in the first one I had read the relationships between the characters had already been sorted out. I had gotten use to Spencer being able to handle the emotional side as far as Susan is concerned and therefore I found Susan's ""problem"" with Spencer's' attitude towards love, life and his work extremely irritating. Hawk was about as scary/dangerous as a reflection. The whit was there, the easy repartee, the cooking and all the other things that make Spencer an excellent read, but had I never read this book it wouldn't have mattered one iota. BUT - not to worry, the other books are excellent, worth your time and money and re-readable several times. ENJOY"
4,"Even When It's Old, It Doesn't Get Old","Spenser novels are great. They're easy to read, the dialog snaps like a towel, and the characters are memorable.This is an early novel, so there are no cell phones, no internet, no idea that those things might be coming. You notice this, but you don't miss it. Spenser was Robert B. Parker go to guy and the combination of the supporting characters provide a great foundation on which countless stories have been built. Observations about gender, race, and class are a little dated, but you can't admire Parker for evolving the characters unless you see from whence they started.We miss you Mr. Parker."
3,Promised Land,Good book. It was predictable as usual but not as much action this go round. I like Parker's modern day version of the honorable cowboys such as the Sacketts.
4,Early Days Parker,Parker progressed substantially as he perfected his technique.Not quite as droll as later works but he already showed his ability to beat up on people.His perfected series in Paradise became his best work.
4,Promised Land fulfills its promise,"Who can be unhappy with a Robert B. Parker book. His descriptions, plots and solutions are always well crafted and keep you wanting more."
3,A Bit Of A Slip,"This one was not up to the usual standard of the Spenser series. This mother/wife was selfish and ridiculous. The idea that Spenser could arrange to have felony murder charges dropped to protect her was rather ridiculous, too. Not as good as the rest of the series, but should be included for the continuity of the series."
2,First Hawk-- but doesn't offer much else,"We finally meet the delightful Hawk... and that's about all the fun there is to be had in this fourth outing in the series. A great deal of time is spent on the dynamics of marriage, sex, and women's liberation and it's all pretty boring. Maybe if it fed somehow into the mystery, of which there is little, it would fit. Mostly though, it seems like Parker is shoehorning some societal concerns into a nominal Spenser story. He and Susan go round and round, declaring their love for each other, eating, drinking, carousing, making love, etc. The bad guys are met, tricked, and defeated without much ado. I'm reading these in order and I have to say, this one's enough to put me off the whole thing entirely. Fortunately, I am reassured to find others rate this book poorly and that the series grows from here on out."
4,Read this fun book,"I really enjoyed this book. Every character in this book had something to keep it interesting, even poor Harvey. It's sad, funny and I didn't want to put it down. Loved Spencer and Susan. They really compliment each other. Thanks again Robert B. Parker!"
2,Promised Land.,It was less than enjoyable. I had been told to read Robert Parker's books. I shall try another one to confirm this is how I feel.
3,good but not great,Not a classic Parker book by any means. There is a failure in all author's books some where or another you just have to wait for it and hope it isn't an indication of a loss over the long term.
2,Early yet timeless Spenser,"If you aren't familiar with the Spenser series, this is the fourth book. Not that you have to read them in any particular order--but it is interesting to follow the development of the series chronologically. In this tale, Spenser ends up involved in finding a runaway wife--and bailing out her husband from his own mess too. This being an earlier Spenser book gives us a glimpse at how Spenser's relationship with Susan Silverman evolves and a foreshadowing of events to come in the relationship's future. Most notable is the introduction of Hawk to the series (not necessarily as an ally!). Parker's excellent characterization of Spenser through the character's musings, witty remarks, and ethical action are as strong in this novel as any of the other Spenser books I've read thus far. The plot itself has an entertaining build up and even better conclusion--I'd definitely recommend Promised Land to anyone curious about the series."
4,Fixed,"If you are not familiar with this story by Robert B. Parker buy the actual book and not this kindle version. It reads like a combination pdf document and screen play. No dialogue designation at all. No 'Spenser said...' or 'Hawk replied' anywhere. To determine who said what one has to go back and find the quotation marks. Very disruptive to the flow of the story! The entire copy is left justified, really ruins an excellent Spenser novel.The book has been fixed now and a new copy was provided, thanks."
1,"Great book, but don't get it on your Kindle","I have read many books on my Kindle and have been pleased with the rendering of all of them, except for this one. I'm not sure how this book was transcribed to the Kindle, but the transcription is awful. Page after page of spelling errors, well, the words are real, but not the correct word. It passed the spell-check, but the sentence is nonsense. From the context you can generally figure out what word was intended, but it happens so often that it really detracts from the book. Read the book? Absolutely - it's a four star book, but get it in paperback."
2,"A dated, smug Spenser","This book is more than 20 years old, and it hasn't aged well. Spenser is flip and condescending as he deals with women in search of themselves in the long-ago days of Phil Donahue, Alan Alda and Patty Hearst. At times, he is so smug (Susan's word, by the way) that I was sorry I picked up the book. For diehard fans of the series, this edition is noteworthy for the introduction of Hawk. Now that gentleman has indeed aged well."
3,Not a bible,"This book is not a bible on any topic related to digital TV. It's more of a synopsis that briefly discusses what's involved in encoding, transmitted, receiving, and decoding digital signals, with an emphasis on the standards being used in Europe.I recommend this book for engineers new to the field of digital TV; but once you have an overall idea of how a digital system works, I recommend getting something more specific to your area. This book does not have any formulas or walk-through examples.To quote the author from the preface, ""This book does not aim to make the reader an expert in digital television... The main goal is to enable readers to understand the principles of this new technology, to have a relatively global perspective on it, and...to investigate further any particular aspect by reading more specialized and more detailed books."""
2,Slow!!,When I ordered this subscription I was never told that it would take 12 weeks to deliver the first magazine!!! Boo - Hiss!!!
4,"Good Read, But Not As Consistent","This is one of my favorite magazines, however I must confess that I have been somewhat disappointed since the focus of the magazine changed from ""CIGAR Afficianado"" to ""Cigar AFFICIANADO"". To those who don't understand this, take a look at what is emphasized on current issues, versus the emphasis on previous deals.While the most recent issue (with Mayor Guilani) was great, other issues have reflected the magazine's trend toward a more general circulation ""lifestyle"" format focusing on attracting the ""female reader"". Earlier issues which contained profiles on J P Morgan, politicians such as JFK and handled weighty topics have given way to puff pieces on Kevin Bacon Raquel Welsh (OK, so the pictures in the latter article were good.I'd prefer more frequent substantive articles rather than just recylced ""Wine Spectator"" or ""GQ"" stuff."
3,used to love it,"Once upon a time, this was one of my favorite magazines. The reason was simple. I love cigars and this was a magazine primarily about cigars. The cigar content now, though, seems often to be an after-thought. The serious articles of the past have given way to more and more ads and articles about watches and shirts that cost more than the gross national product of much of the world. Too much now is about frivolous celebrity culture, devoid of any cigar-related content. If I had the slightest interest in how some actor/singer/athlete lives, I would read one of those magazines. While I will still occasionally pick this up, and still do find the occasional exceptional article, I have now turned to Cigar magazine for my cigar-related content."
2,not really a cigar mag,as stated this is mostly adds and articles about pricey toys. don't waste your money. go to famous smoke . com and check out what people think who aren't receiving add money.
4,man talk,"Cool cars, expensive vodka, Italian suits, football, golf and its accoutrements, watches named after international capitals.Oh, and cigars.That's what you get in this quintessential rich man's magazine. Cigars are merely the hook and sustained theme, but upon this hook there hang and around this theme are embroidered myriad topics that men with a lot of discretionary spending power - or those who like to think they have it - enjoy.The articles are generally well-written, their text surrounded by the volume of attractive white space with which a high-end glossy can afford to pamper the reader's eye. There's not a lot of intellectual content or insightful analysis of world events, but then that's not what men come to CIGAR AFICIONADO to find.This monthly 'Good Life Magazine for Men' is all about eye candy and expensive guy toys without the soft porn that often peppers such periodicals."
2,A Mockery of A Magazine.,"CA has now alienated pretty much all of it's subscribers. It has a very limited number of pages dedicated to cigars. Most of the pages are dedicated to purchasing dress shirts on Savile Row for $700.00 a piece. $15,000 Swiss watches and stupid gadgets that make you think you are reading the Sharper Image. I paid for a cigar magazine, not the Robb Report. Thanks, but no thanks."
3,"Cute, but not really worth the money","While this game was cute and had plenty of flashbacks to your childhood, it seemed the same 10 cartoon characters were the answers to most questions. Four people playing this game once was about as long as the question cards lasted. The picture cards were not usually any easier than the question cards, but those same 10 chracters still seemed to be the correct answers. The board was interesting, and the pieces were nice, but since only 4 people can play at a time, it is very limited. Maybe that is why they have so few questions....."
2,Might be worth it if you get it cheap,"I've played twice now, and both times it was ""okay"" fun--not great, not awful (I can't imagine playing it time after time after time like the Genus editions). I also can't imagine ever playing a ""long"" game, as a short game takes enough time--since no one knows hardly any of the answers (most of the questions are quite obscure). I don't know what's up with the plastic-box card holder thing. It's not big enough to hold an entire row of cards, so you're always changing them, and it's not designed well either, so the cards don't sit in it nicely. The only really cool thing are the four pieces (Bugs, Batman, Scooby, and I forget!) and how the colored pies actually ""lock"" into place."
1,A big letdown,"Normally, the specialized versions of Trivial Pursuit have been quite fun, but this version is the one and only dissapointment I have ever had from this line of otherwise fun games. The difficulty of the questions is the main obstacle; my friends and I (all 20-somethings) had never heard of most of the movies and TV shows in this game, and we thought we were real Loonie Tunes and Cartoon Network buffs. Why couldn't the game have stuck to it's advertising: Bugs, Daffy, Dorothy, Dexter's Lab, and Cow and Chicken? Because who would by a game with ""Thor"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"" -- the answers to at least 15 of the questions -- plastered all over the box? About as many people who would buy something like ""Lifetime Movie of the Week Trivial Pursuit."" A big letdown sums it all up: it's worth maybe one or two plays, and then it would look nice on your shelf, or in a display case to show off the attractive pewter figurines. Skip it."
2,Not for our generation,"This game is for Warner Bros. enthusiasts ONLY! Very obscure questions, very few an 8-29-year-old could answer."
2,Dissappointing,"Well, perhaps I should have predicted this, but the questions are just impossible. I thought I (and the friend I bought this for) were true Warner Bros. cartoon buffs, but this was rediculous. Admittedly, we did not try the supposedly easier kiddie-cards. The image of Bugs is plastered all over the game, but we encountered maybe 2 questions about him and maybe 3 other Loony Tunes questions over the course of 3 hours. Many questions seemed to promote obscure shows on TV now (things you didn't even know were afiliated with Warner Bros.), perhaps to remind you that you should watch them. We were able to make the game hilariously fun, though, by having the question-reader (1) determine what was the best color to try to answer, and (2) employ whatever means possible to get the person to answer correctly - it was more like playing Taboo. I'm sure some people would enjoy and do well at this game, but BE WARNED!"
4,"Need more books like ""To the Limits""","Really enjoyed the subject matter of the book. Gave it a four only because I would have liked yet more stories about successful executives dabbling in adventures and expeditions. Also, would like to hear about more women. I enjoy Jim Clash's writing in Forbes as well."
4,Didn't know much about this product,"Product was as described. I didn't know much about the 12 year old recipient other than he likes cars and models. He was pleased, but not overly enthused."
4,Basic Brown,"Everyone of us usually loves to make a fresh cup of coffee in the morning. Nevertheless, getting the best quality filters are definitely the biggest hastle for your coffeemaker. These Melita Cone #2 coffee filter are one of the best made filters around. They are woven tight, and completely seperate the ground coffee from spilling into your carafe, or your mug if you use Melita's Perfect Brew mug coffee makers. I like these a whole lot because they really help make the best coffee around. If you want to make a great cup of coffee, than you'll definitely want to get some of the best filters available. I definitely suggest you buy these #2 Coffee Filters. It is a definite buy, so drink up!Price: B+Quality: A-Overall: B+"
2,You Can Do Better,Not all that well made - a better one is available at Bed Bath & Beyond for the same price.

You know it's a good show when you own the DVD's and still stop to watch reruns when they come on TV. A consistantly funny and fun show to watch, and Season 2 is just getting it started!"
5,Great Movie,Just what we were looking for we have lots of family members that like this tv show so it was a great idea
5,A book to remember,This is one of the best novels I have read since One Hundred Years of solitude. The first chapters are a bit confusing and it is hard to see where the book is going to but later on the book stars to unveil the most enjoyable adventure before your eyes. Mr. Mailer really has the gift to paint with words in the reader's mind. I do recommend this book without hesitation.
5,Not your usual bedtime story . . . .,"I first read this book in 1994. Over the years I have read this book over and over again. Every time I read it, something new pops up! This story(s) are beautifully put together and the entire thing is fantastic!I notice other reviews lament about the sometimes gory details,YES!, but that is the beauty of this book. This is the way human nature is, raw and unapologetic! Mailer didn't writing this to please people. Another thing, keep this book away from young children, unless you want to answer ""birds and the bees"" questions sooner. (there is an explicit description of oral copulation between a certain character and his wife, if you need an example) Anyhoo, if your the kind of reader who enjoy a little meat to their reading, you'll enjoy this one! On a side note, I've found that this book is better if read with a glass of wine."
3,"bien documentado, pero no lleva a ningun sitio","este libro, enorrrrrrrrrrrrrrme es interesante y esta muy bien documentado, tambien esta lleno de malas palabras pero leyendo a mailer uno se acostumbra. uno aprende varias cosas sobre la vida faraonica, aunque hay que investigar, pues uno no sabe cuando es imaginacion y cuando es realidad documentada. lo que pasa con este libro, que en si no es un fallo es que al terminar, parece que solo se han leido todas esas paginas para nada, no sientes emocion, ni ardor nio catarsis ni nada es como ver un programa tonto, solo has pasado el rato.LUIS MENDEZ crazzyteacher@hotmail.com"
1,Simply awful.,"This was a magnificent waste of time -- not only is it hard to read, but there is no pay off! From start to finish the book is a tangled morass of hallucinogenic flashbacks. As others have mentioned, the bizarre sexual imagery is pervasive and oppressive. There are plenty of other great sources for learning about Ancient Egypt -- skip this one!"
2,"Lewd, Disgusting but at times Enlightening & Powerful","Full of characters who eat the excrement, flesh or [body parts] of a variety of animals in order to gain the wisdom and strength that they offer, Ancient Evenings journeys a path into a world of Ancient Egypt that I have never known. Nor frankly, for that matter, care to. Yet, Mailer's portrait of Rameses II, Usermare as he is known is this work, is incredible. Divine and human, Horus and Set are woven so well into the fabric of of this pharoah's character that his struggle to maintain harmony between these two opposing forces alone is worth wading through the rest of the book. My faith in Ancient Egypt as a whole and its actual traditions is restored by Mailer, however, by the conclusion of this work but not before I have been thoroughly disgusted by a variety of acts descibed by the protagonist Menehetet."
1,The Scourge of Egypt Needs A Purge,"Whether the writer is famous (like Mailer) or an unknown, it must have been easier to publish a novel when this first came out. If an unknown attempted to publish this book today, it would be rejected. It's bloated, scattered, confusing in need of a strong laxative to get rid of the crap. That would narrow this mammoth into a novella. It's loaded with sex (odd that Mailer claims to be homophobic but loves writing about it), magic and myth of the period. The only good think I can say about this book is Mailer did his research and some of the descriptive passages leap off the page; however, most of the book is too arthritic to jump. I haven't read anything satisfying by this author and thought this book might be the exception but like like the author, both are full of crap and need a good purging."
1,dire.. no really,"Self indulgent garbage from the pen of the once (it seemed to me anyway) infallible Mailer. What the hell was he thinking? I find it hard to believe that this mess came from the mind of the same man that wrote The Naked And The Dead. Ok, at some points the narrative can be readable, even enjoyable; a few protagonists certainly succeed in stimulating the reader at a few points; but by and large this is a rambling piece of piss. If you enjoyed this then I envy you because you are certainly easily amused, more than I can say.Too often this book relies on nothing more than cheap shock value to engage the reader, artless descriptions of intercourse/ copulation which probably means heaven on earth for some panting voyeurs out there but sadly left me unmoved. Some might say I'm being a bit too scathing but I'm only voicing my opinion and I honestly think this book should be burned."
4,Pretty good,"Overall good book, somewhat confusing but when it catches it really gets going. Highly recommended although it will not be everyone's cup of tea."
2,A long way from Mailer's best,"There are moments of brilliance in this book, but they're few and far between. This is the third Mailer book I've read, after The Naked And The Dead and The Fight. Both, in their different ways, utterly brilliant. This book just goes on interminably and you get the impression Mailer just gets sick of it, wraps things up quickly and gets out of there. If you can make it that far though, the last few pages are great!"
2,All sound and no fury,"This book is a dud, and a long and painful one at that. I've been reading Mailer my entire life. He's written masterpieces (Armies of the Night, Executioner's Song) and there are the great collections of journalism (Advertisements for Myself, Existential Errands, etc), but let's face it, he's never written even a good novel, and this one doesn't even come close. There's a lot of huffing and puffing and certainly some interesting recreations of the Ancient Egypt, but the book goes nowhere and adds up to nothing. Norman Mailer needs an enema -- and fast!"
4,As expected!,This is just what I wanted. It is very solid (and heavy) and works great. I don't worry about it chipping or breaking at all. The bowl itself holds two cups of water and not more. I really like it!!
1,terrible workmanship,"I ordered a new mortar and pestle. The one they sent me had chunks of the granite missing on the sides and the bottom, and the bottom had a large K scratched into it (deep scratch - about a quarter of an inch in). The mortar and pestle work fine (at the end of the day they're not too high tech), but when you order something new, you expect something new. This was clearly used or defective. the seller hasn't responded to my email, and obviously this is not something I want to spend too much time on - so it looks like I'm stuck with a used product when I paid for a new one."
5,Awesome Love Story in Beautiful Italy's Countryside,"I've seen this movie a few times and finally broke down and got myself a copy since Amazon's price was awesome. The scenery and setting are beautiful. The love between the husband and wife is very real and touching. There is also some everyday life humor that makes the drama lighter, and isn't real life like that? I also love that these characters are middle aged, married for years, and still in love. It's not wishy-washy; they have had life through them a few curves. The characters are likable and have depth. I would characterize this movie as drama/romance with a side of humor. I could say more but I don't want to give away the plot!"
4,A wonderful romance,"I didn't know what to expect from this film with Reno cast the lead character. I was rewarded with a warm comedy about two people who deeply love each other, and have what seems to be an insurmountable problem to cope with, with regards Roseanna's last wish. A funny very enjoyable film with, a great cast that causes you to look past some of the small problems with the story: ie Roseanna only looks more beautiful as the story progresses. Well worth seeing"
4,Uplifting and delightful!,"I highly recommend this film. My husband and I both laughed aloud at many points throughout the film. And, it is a really touching and loving look at marriage...something you don't see often today. The cinematography is wonderful...it's eye candy throughout!"
1,this movie is not a comedy,"I am a huge Jean Reno fan and he embarassed me throughout this movie. The plot was ridiculous (particularly the side story concerning an ex-con). The saccharine relationship between Reno and Mercedes Ruehl was painful to watch. If you are a fan of goofy romances, you will enjoy this movie. If you are a fan of Jean Reno and do not want to see him play a buffoon, steer clear of For Roseanna!"
3,"Rather exicting,,but they could have done something better","Good fights ,a good story, sexy and dangerous girls.The plot should've been better organized;perhaps this movie should have been longer."
5,Solar-powered hat,"I purchased the hat 2 weeks ago and used it when I worked as a vendor at an street fair in 95-degree heat last weekend. It helped a lot, and the only time I needed to run it on the battery was when I went indoors. Actually, it is lightweight, and only uses 1 AA battery. Everyone who saw me with the hat demanded to know where I bought it."
2,"Looks good, but doesn't work well","I received this hat recently, took it in the sun, nothing. Zip. Nada. Stuck a battery in it and the fan works. So what I discovered is that you have to take it in the sun and give the fan a nudge to get it going. Then when you walk through shade, it stops. To get it going again, you have to nudge it again. Talk about annoying. It can be run off a battery instead. So technically speaking, yes it works, if you don't mind constantly nudging the fan to restart it."
3,Won't blow you away,"I'm not sure what I was expecting from the fan. It's not really noisy but you can hear it. The volume of air it moves is very low and barely noticeable. On solar only, you'll need a bright sunny day between 10:30am-1:30pm to generate enough sun light to power the fan. The hat fits comfortabily but doesn't fit snuggly and will fall/blow off, likely due to the placement of the solar cell and fan."
4,Runs good battery,"I bought this hat because I liked the idea of the solar powered fan. The fan does run on solar power, but even in full sun the fan does not run as well as when in runs on battery. When running on solar power the fan will speed up, slow down, or stop depending on the orientation of the solar cell. The fan may stop even if you are standing in the sun if the top of the hat is not pointing in the right direction. My other problem with the hat is that it is almost too small. I wear a 7 hat size and it fits very snug.The fan runs very well on battery and I can move in and out the shade and it still runs. I plan on using the solar power as a backup. The hat does seem to keep me cooler and I wear it whenever I work outside. The air flow over my face does fill nice in the Louisiana summers."
1,Cool hat,"This was a big mistake to buy. It has little or no effect as to cooling, the solar panel quit charging almost immediately and the hat itself heats up in the sun. Warning to potential customers, stay away from this piece of junk."
1,I didn't like it at all,"I see I'm in the minority. I ordered the hat as a father's day gift but it seemed such a good idea that I couldn't resist trying it out with the idea of getting one each for myself and my wife. When I tried it out I was so disappointed. The tiny little fan blew such a small spot on my face that I couldn't tell that it really cooled at all. The sensation was, however, very annoying. It wasn't at all like being in front of a fan, more like someone blowing through a straw on your face. So now I have to go through the ordeal of returning it. And btw there is a 20% restocking fee."
2,If you wand a hot head.......,"The solar panel does not work. It takes me 3 hours to mow my lawn. In northern Illinois we had a very hot and sunny summer. The fan did not ever work under solar power. If I had had the time,I would have returned this product. Lord knows that I am so sick and tired of buying %^*#@ crap."
4,Safari Fan Hat,"I work outdoors in the summer and thought about trying to design a hat with a fan, but when I saw this on-line, I decided, for the price, it was worth a try. It works pretty well, though the fan is small and would be better with a larger fan. The solar panel does not work unless the sun is directly over-head and no clouds. I just use the battery mode all the time. The hat is naturally cool, since it is like a hard hat with a head band that lets air naturally circulate under it. The opening in the hat brim for the fan lets the sun in on your nose and face and I don't like that, but may try to design a shade to attach over it to block out the sun. Over all, I thought it was worth the money."
4,"Soft, comfy and priced reasonably","I disagree with the previous comment about them being flimsy - I think the whole idea of the fabric is to not be heavy on the hands. It's a spandex type of material that's very soft and silky to the touch. I owned a pair of these many years ago but lost them in a move and so I ordered the new updated version which is what you get now. Personally, I love them. As medical transcriptionist, they keep my hands warm (without getting hot) and help alleviate the aches and pains in my hands and wrists. I also wear these on cold nights when my joints start aching. The wrist fabric is a little thicker and more firm, so it keeps my wrists from bending. The only thing to take note of, is their measuring system. I measured a small, but really, I needed a medium. The small size (3) was a bit to tight. So, maybe size up. For the money, I think they're worth a try."
1,"helps a little, but kind of flimsy","I bought these gloves after my hand started to hurt from using the computer for extensive periods of time. I quite a bit disapointed after recieving them. I would definatly say that they are not worth $16. They are very flimsy and remind me of something that i would find on a rack in a 99 cent store.. I have been using them on the computer and i will say that they are better than nothing, but i am still searching for a good pair of gloves to use on the computer, and i don't think that these will last very long.."
2,"Relatively thin, poorly constructed cheapo towels.","I got a pair of these from Amazon because the price was right.Or was it? Turns out that even at a bargain basement price these towels were no deal. They're relatively thin and poorly constructed (they shed like crazy and I suspect they'll be dust in short order...not that they're gonna stay in my house long enough to find out...) These are hardly ""luxury"" quality towels.I made a mistake with my money. Now I'm trying to help you avoid the same mistake. Put...the...mouse...down...now...and...walk...away...from...the...terminal..."
3,beware of color..,"it looks different, even on the pictures for this review. two different colors are shown..."
2,Nothing fancy,"The fourth incarnation of Police Academy brings us ""cops"" - citizens on patrol - but sadly no new ideas. Although the movie is quite amusing it most certainly lacks the prequels' wits and charme. Only for PA-fans!"
4,Police Academy 4 - A good movie,"BUT IT WOULD BE A BETTER MOVIE ON DVD!! WHY ISN'T THIS ON DVD?? THEY AREN'T EVEN IN A BOXED SET!!But ofcourse this was a good movie... Not so good as the 1st 3, but it's good..."
4,Best In The Series...,"This really was the best movie of the series, next to Police Academy 2:Citizens On Patrol. I think the transfer to dvd was pretty good on all of these movies, the only complaint I have is that 4 and 5 are Full Screen. Why couldn't they release it in Widescreen along with the rest of em?Oh well. I give it a 4 out of 5. If it was in Widescreen I would give it a 5. I definitely recommend this if you love the comedies of the 80s."
2,Police Academy 4,"This time around Lassard has come up with a programm C.O.P. or Citizens on Patrol, where local people can receive training to protect themselves.Not very original,they are recycling ideas that have already been used in the series.However there are some good moments,Capt Harris and Proctor are always good. Notable for an early film appearance of David Spade.Tony Hawk is also featured in a brief role.IF you've saw the others you might as well watch this one too."
3,Police Academy 4 - Citizens on Patol,"Police Academy 4 was an okay movie with some humorous episodes. Like most sequals, it isn't nearly as entertaining as the first two. I have seen them all and each one is slightly less entertaining than the previous one."
2,Police Academy 4 - Citizens on Patrol ~ Steve Guttenberg,"This series, Police Academy 4 - Citizens on Patrol~ Steve Guttenberg, was getting worst and worst. The acting is like nowhere close to the first movie. This movie is about as filled steerotypes as ever. The fighting Italian family, the obligatory Blue Oyster Bar. Here we get to see a young David Spade in his first movie and he was the lucky winner to be included in this mediocre junk. This is also Steve Guttenbergs last movie playing the role as Mahoney and I do not blame him for wanting out. The jokes are the same as in the first movie. The script is like a joke compared to the first movie and the citizens on patrol idea was just stupid. The music is terrible and sounds like the cheapest 80's music that they could possibly find. This movie should only be seen by Police Academy diehards. Otherwise this sequell could like easily be avoided and this is getting close to being a turkey."
2,A lesser contribution,"The field of Ezra Pound studies is now very crowded, and justly so, as there is much to ponder in order to achieve a balanced judgment about the work of this major poet.Unfortunately, compared to the work of Christoph de Nagy, Herbert N. Schneidau, and Hugh Witemeyer (all indispensable), this book tells us little about Pound's pre-Cantos work. Grieve's theory that Pound displaces the self from the poetry fails to convince, as some of his work is clearly about the struggle to be a poet in an unpoetic change. Also, if Pound had succeeded in banishing subjectivity, how are the Pisan Cantos, which are very subjective, even possible?Skip this one."
4,the begining,"The story starts in a mevieval world.In a land called Caithe. It was about twenty years after a nearly two centuries of civil war. Peace have been in the kingdom. So to speak of. A king found away joint them together. Their was pockets of destruction. Because. Of madness of magic appearing. Their history claims wizard or Lorngeld as they are known. Caused the mass destruction for over two centuries. A head-strong princess who is sort of tomboy. Is sent of to a nearby kingdom. To create of peace between the two lands.When she arrived, she recover a terrible secret. That was hidden from her people. And found out she was one of thoses people. She taught to fear. And the real reason. Why the civil war started. And why the probems still continuted."
3,"Not bad, but a Deryni knock-off.","This book was well done and the story was intruiging, but I couldn't help but be constantly reminded of Katherine Kurtz's Deryni series. I would like to read more of this world, but I do believe this book has no sequel."
3,Fibromyalgia information,I bought this book for my daughter who had just been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. I found that the book had a lot of useful information that was written clearly and was easy to understand. The downside of this book was the overall depressive tone and the sense of hopelessness.My daughter read the book and was very saddened afterwards. I wouild have liked just a glimmer of something positive.
5,Best Information on FM,"This is the most easy to understand and best compiled information I have on Fibromyalgia and Myofascial Pain. Recently I have been having a lot of ""spells"" with A-Fib and ""chest"" pain. All my test on my heart show the heart is in excellant condition. I had not referred to this book in awhile but when I dusted it off I found the answers to the problems I have been experiencing. Especially in the section ""What to tell your Cardiologist"" and ""What to tell the Emergency Room Drs"". It is great to know your heart checks out in ""great condition"" and that there is an answer to why you are experiencing what you are experiencing. Now I know what course I need to take and I am reassured of no heart problems."
5,An incredible help & guide,"This book was a help, a guide, and comfort to/for me.I wish I could find a doctor in person who could provide what this book did for me, truly.Thank you, to the author.Thank you to the amazon for providing the best deal!"
5,Wonderful Material,"I purchased this book for a friend of mine, recently. I had all ready bought it and it's companion book about 4 years ago. My friend was absolutely amazed at the ""right on"" words of Dr. Starlanyl on the FMS and CMP. She also was taken in by the easy to understand material. There was so much she had validated..she couldn't put the book down for a couple of days! It doesn't take the pain away..but it sure helps to know it ""isn't all in your head""!!!"
4,Very Educational,This book has been very educational for me. I have suffered for years with FMS and it was great to receive up to date information. This book also has a wonderful chapter on helping those around you to understand how chronic pain effects a persons everyday life. I would highly recommend this book for both the person with chronic pain and their loved ones who are dealing with it on the sidelines.
5,Thanks you so much Devin!,"I am so grateful to Devin for writing this book! I find myself using it as a reference all the time. Even though most of us dont have as many resources as she does, I wouldnt even know where to start without her book. Who would ever think that pain releif could be as close as a tennis ball? So many great ideas and insite! If you are looking for a cure you will probably be disappointed but if you are looking for help and support this is the book."
2,The Fibromyalgia Advocate,This book was ok but it had alot of info. on stuff I don't need. It also repeated itself ALOT! It wasn't what I thought it was going to be from the info given. I was very disappointed.
5,"A superb, international collection of botanical art.","This is an excellent collection of botanical illustrations reproduced in very detailed, rich color on quality paper. Artists from all over the world are represented with brief biographies of each one. I think this book is one of the best books to have if you love botanical illustration and would like to see examples done by highly skilled, scientifically accurate illustrators. Just as good or better than the first Shirley Sherwood collection book."
5,Beautiful sugar bowl,This sugar bowl is modern and beautiful and completes perfectly the Precious Platinum China from Royal Doulton. A must have!
4,Little pricey but great protection..recommended.,"I thought this was a bit pricey at $30, but it is much better than the silicone case. It offers great screen protection and product protection. I've dropped the player twice with no damage! The clip swivels and seems pretty sturdy, though it adds some bulk to the player. Moving the ""hold"" switch is a little difficult through the neoprene (I don't have fingernails, those who do will not have a problem!). This was only the second case option that I saw for this item but so much more worth it than the other cheaply made option. Oh, yeah! It comes with a MUCH BETTER arm band than the one that came with the product. So if that is important to you, then I would increase the rating to 5-stars."
5,A thrilling rollercoaster ride,"Misery is one of the more suspenseful movies I have seen in a long time! First of all, I must complement Kathy Bates for portraying Annie Wilkes in a very convincing, albeit frightening way. I'm so glad the Motion Picture Academy awarded her the best actress award in 1990. If you are looking for a movie to scare the heck out of you, watch Misery!! Also great performace by James Caan."
3,Halfway decent effort,"(Instead of reviewing a film you probably know, I stick to special features of the DVD)(THIS REFERS TO THE UK VERSION)Those extras:Commentary: Fair. Reiner, who I've heard a few times now, really needs to work on this. Far, far too many lapses where he disappears. Another track features an arrogant Goldman bashing directors for having no imagination and praising---hell, overpraising---his writing abilities. At one point he even pauses for a few moments then chimes in, ""Sorry, this dialogue is just so well written"".New Interviews: Pretty much picture perfect. Not just Caan, Bates, Reiner, and Goldman, but DP Sonnenfeld, and even Sternhagen. Interesting stories from the set and years later.Overall: Just those couple of things to get excited about. A lack of behind the scenes stuff, deleted scenes, outtakes, et al, don't make this a must buy unless you just want to own the film."
4,Worthy upgrade,"You all know what the movie is about, so I won't rehash it here. This film has been released on DVD before, but that was back when MGM owned themselves and put out poor DVD product. Now (circa 2007) that Fox owns MGM, they are re-releasing a number of MGM titles in much better quality. This is a prime example. MGM had released this important film in letterboxed only format - no 16:9 anamorphic enhancement for widescreen TVs. No bonuses either. Fox has now delivered a superb 16:9 transfer that totally blows away the older disc. The bonuses are plenty, entertaining, and informative. The packaging is nice too, and looks like a hardcover book.It is easy to recommend purchasing this disc by Fox. I own a Blu-ray player, but DVD is still my main squeeze. And with quality like this, why not?"
5,Kathy Bates and James Caan are superb!!!!!,"In Misery a mentally unbalanced, psychotic nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates)nurses her favorite author Paul Sheldon (James Caan)back to health after she saves him from a car crash. But instead of sending him to a hospital where he really needs to go she keeps him a prisoner in her secluded cabin and forces him to write his greatest novel just for her. Locked in his room, addicted to the drug Narville she gives him to heel his pain, and at the mercy of this unstable female he doesn't have much choice. But writers can find their own ways to strike back...Superb acting. Bates does a good psycho. Perfect movie to watch alone but you might want to leave the lights on. Would love to have the video."
4,I Feel Your Pain!,"I thought this was a great movie. I read the Stephen King novel first, and the movie lived up to my expectations."
5,An author's nightmare!,"Misery is a strange tale about a crazed fan who locks up her favorite author in a room. She wants him to write the novel,Misery to her specifications. After beatings and being drugged, the author still keeps his head clear. He plays into her sick and demented fantasy world just to stay alive.This movie almost made me afraid of being an author!Great read and wonderful movie. I recommend this movie."
2,MGM drops the ball again,"This is the 2nd release of Misery on DVD and MGM still didn't bother to create an anamorphic (enhanced for 16x9) widescreen transfer. The widescreen version offered here is non-anamorphic letterboxed, so widescreen-TV buyers beware. The print they had to work with is decent, but nowhere near perfect.One of the better King adaptations, largely due to Caan and Bates, but only 2 stars for a second lame DVD transfer. It will be interesting to see if MGM releases it for a 3rd time in an anamorphic special edition, or if they will just wait for the inevitable high definition release."
3,whatever happened to baby jane much?,"most fans of this movie seem to have never seen ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" before.Mr King was obviously influenced by that movie while writing Misery. A demented woman keeping an invalid locked up.But James Caan and Kathy Bates manage to give great performances: They are the ones who make the movie. Not to mention it is always a delight having lauren Bacall on screen.This movie is entertaining like most of King's early works."
4,A little something different than hero worship,"Caan is a brilliant writer who has an accident on a slippery road (Hi, Pet Sematary) and Bates comes to his aid. As she nurses him back to health, she brutally critiques his latest works and he soon discovers that she has kidnapped him with no intention of releasing him... alive. Excellently remarkable performance by Bates gives the term ""psycho"" a new face and scares the viewer into painless convulsions without impressive special effects or a stupidly thawed level-headedness. Caan is just aching to be victimized anyway."
5,Awesome,"I had always wanted to see this movie. I knew I would love it so much that I went around telling people it was my favorite movie even before I saw it. I read the book first and it horrified me. It was GREAT! Then, I saw the movie, and even though I had read the book first, the movie still scared the beejeezus outta me. I was not disappointed. Kathy Bates was the scariest villain I've ever seen in anything and she chilled me to the bone. Kudos to her Oscar-winning perfrmance. This movie is great. I would hate to go through hobbling if you know what I mean..."
1,"Sorry folks, excellent movie, AWFUL DVD","I am simply reviewing the DVD on this one. For such a wonderful film this DVD has NOTHING. And when I say nothing, I mean NOTHING. Oh, a booklet that's a whopping fold-open which doesn't give any information what so ever. I love this film, and it's by far the best Stephen King sceen adaptation ever, but it's a real shame there aren't ANY extras to speak of on this DVD. Special Edition is needed BIG TIME!"
3,An Engaging Story,Misery is an engaging story but drags during the middle of the movie. Kathy Bates is excellent and James Caan is credible as the helpless victim. There are some twists and turns that keep the plot interesting enough but it is rather dry in the scenes where Kathy Bates is absent.
3,Okay,"The book was better. In fact, the book had more blood and gore in it, than in the movie. The book also has a much better ending to it. But the Lauren person who played Anne Wilkes did an awesome job of it."
2,it was ok,"All I have heard about this movie was great but I didn't like the acting or anything in the movie, but I thought the book was great. In the books, we get to use more of our imagination sometimes and the movies, well, you can't really use your imagination in this one. I kept telling myself ""ohh it will get better in a few mins"" but it didn't. The biggest dissapointment was everyone telling me to get it, waiting this long for it to come in, then it not meeting my expectations."
4,Intense thriller,"An acting tour de force for stars James Caan and Kathy Bates and a triumph for director Rob Reiner. The action is mostly confined to a single house and involves conflict between just two characters, yet the tension is palpable. Bates' character undergoes violent and frightening mood swings, which are expertly played. Caan's air of quiet desperation is also well-done. William Goldman's script also deserves mention: the characters behave intelligently, so it is enjoyable to watch the cat-and-mouse game that unfolds before us."
5,Misery,"This is one of the best Stephen king adaptations (aside from Carrie and Christine and the shinning). Great suspense. One of my favorite things about the film is Cathie bates emotional down fall! There is only one more thing I would like to say,I don't think they should consider this a horror movie it's more of a thriller!"
5,Grabs Your Interest And Doesn't Let Go,"This film is based on the novel by Stephen King. It stars Kathy Bates, who does a phenomenal acting job. This movie grabs ahold of your interest and doesn't let go until the credits roll. It is shocking and thrilling and downright creepy at times. This movie is full of suspense and you will want to watch it over and over again when it ends. BubblesReviews.com Rating: 5 out of 5"
4,The acting is great and the suspense is great,This film is overall great from begging to end. It's one of the best adapted books to screen movies. It's one of the best suspense movies out there and has one of the best villians ever. Kathy Bates is great and she deserved her oscer and all the other actors do a great job. The story is very suspensfull and will have you on the edge of your seat. Overall it's a must see on a cold winters night.
5,You don't get em much better than this.....,"This is simply a fantastic psychological thriller that everyone will enjoy. It is based on the best selling book by Stephen King and really does do it justice.Kathy Bates' performance as the crazed Annie Wilkes is absolutely stunning and really gives the film that 5* rating. She deserved the oscar!Not only is this film scary, its fun in a strange way. You really feel like you are in there trapped with no means of escape. This is pure cinema and entertainment in its highest possible form! Watch it, you'll be pleased you did."
4,Misery,"I purchased this movie from Amazon because they are efficient and I never have a problem with items being shipped. I saw the movie, Misery years ago in the theaters. However, I wanted to watch the movie with a few of my grandchildren who visited for two weeks. They loved it and for me, it was a good movie all over again. The acting is superb, of course. Kathy Bates won an academy award for her part. I also purchased 2016, Obama's America. This is an astonishing, well researched and very fair documentary. Amazingly, I was not able to purchase this DVD at any of the major stores when it was first released. Amazon, of course, has everything at your fingertips."
4,misery,Awesome movie! Totally recommend it to people to watch! It is more affordable online. it includes free copy on amazon instant!
4,misery is good but please release sweet hostage,im a big movie buff i saw close to a million. misery is good but the best is sweet hostage. if sweet hostage made it to dvd it will be a great seller. trust me on this one. i have it on vhs and transfered it onto dvd. everybody i show sweet hostage to says its the best movie they ever saw.
5,great Blu ray,i dont have to talk about the Movie cause everybody knows its one of the best Movies with Kathy Bates i just want to say that i was so surpriced about the BD wounderful picture very dood sound the Movie company did a very good job to make this Blu Ray and iam glad that i got it here from amazon.com here in Germany there are still waiting for the BD!!So buy it you wont get disapointed its awesome
5,Poor mr Sheldon,"Une des toutes meilleures adaptations de Stephen King (à quelques détails près), c'est tout le sel du livre dopé par une interprétation majestueuse, en effet après l'avoir vu il est impossible d'imaginer les personnages principaux autrement que sous les traits de James Caan et Katy Bates.En plus la qualité d'image est au rendez-vous."
5,Suspensful Masterpiece!,One of the best suspense movies I've seen. Stephen King's imagination + Kathy Bates + Caan = Misery: the best suspense can get. I recommend it for all suspense/horror lovers!
1,a KKK favorite,"The Southern Poverty Law Center, in its ""Intelligence Report"" (Winter 2006, pp. 11-13) says this booklet was a ""big seller"" at the recent 25th Aryan Nations 25th World Congress, described as a ""24-hour orgy of racism,"" attended by many members of the Ku Klux Klan and other racists from both sides of the Atlantic, in Laurens, S.C. According to this article, the book ""claims Jews are descendants of Lucifer."""
5,Does its job,"The fish in my husbands pond are happy. We have had some really cold weather in NJ and the heater is working great for the fish, my husband is thrilled he hasn't lost any of the fish."
4,It works pretty well,"It works pretty well, you just need to keep an eye on the water level. The de-icer does de-ice the pond as advertised, it does evaporate the water rather quickly as well. You will need to add water every week or so."
1,what a disaster!,"I have bought many items from Amazon and am usually quite satisfy.This is the first time I wrote a review because it was such a bad experience from the product.Pros: energy efficient, only 100 watts and it works initially.Cons: it shorted out within 1 week after it was plugged in.The worst part of this is it is now frozen into the ice and I cannot remove it to return to amazon for another product.It also burn out the socket around my pond and I do not know how much it will cost me to have that fix when spring comes.Amazon, what can I do to get a refund for this product since I cannot dig it out now? Any one has any idea?"
1,Doesn't last,"Great idea, and works really well until it gets waterlogged and breaks (quickly). We're lucky to get through half a winter before having to replace it. And even though it breaks within the warranty, you must pay to ship it to Colorado, and they will send you another identical piece of junk. The red Danner Pondmaster used to have the same problem, but the new one seems to be working well. Same shape."
2,Good For One Season,"This heater did what it was supposed to do. Kept about a 12"" diameter hole melted through the ice in temperatures near zero F. I did not have a float attachment but used nylon ties to attach it to a float. Now for this season, 2009, it continually trips the ground fault outlet after a few minutes of operation. I'm looking for a more reliable replacement."
1,Worked great but only one season,"It worked great, but only for one year. The next winter when I plugged it in it just didn't turn on. I tried jiggling and tweaking and such, to no avail.I notice many others have had the same problem. How hard can it be to make something so simple that's also reliable? Very disappointed."
4,Economical low energy pond heater,"In the northeast this heater works fairly well under most circumstances. They can however freeze the top hole in snowstorm conditions. If going away for an extended period or vacation, utilize a higher wattage heater to be certain your pond does not freeze. We had the same snowstorm freezing issue with 200 watt ""saucers"" and probably necessary to move up to a 700 or more watt heater."
5,Excellent product,I bought one unit last year and decided to buy two additional units which I have spaced about six feet apart. They work great and now are wedged in the ice but the heating element keeps the center melted all winter long.
5,Great product,It work perfectly. It is November in Chicago and my small outdoor pond was covered by a thin sheet of ice. I put the De-Icer on top of the ice sheet overnight. Wola!!! next morning there is a hole created by the De-Icer. Thank!
5,100 watts VS 1250 watts,"When I decided on this pond heater - I'm thinking that since I went thru 4 Farm Innovators pond heaters at 1250 watts each and they didn't last very long (the last one only worked for a couple weeks) I might as well have one that operates on 100 watts and not work. However, I am quite impressed with this heater, especially its design. I don't know how long it will last (it has a one year guarantee as opposed to a three year for the other), but it works very well and is easy to clean (just wipe) and does not collect clumps of lime as does the Farm Innovators (this one is plastic; the other is metal on the bottom). The cord placement (at the top) and cord length is well thought out. Overall it appears to be an excellent product."
1,Did NOT Work!!!,Placed on my pond that only had less than an inch of ice. Left it out there for a minimum of 4 hours. Unit did nothing to melt the ice - the unit did NOT even heat up!!! Disappointed!!!
3,have to replace,"The product works well for a year sometimes 2 years, but then needs to be replaced. I have been using this product for about 8 years."
1,only worked for one season,Worked fine for one winter. And that's the problem with it. Save your money and buy something else unless you want to replace them every year. I switched to the allied stock tank heater. That heater is still going strong after two winters in my pond.
4,Floating Pond De-Icer,This is my second heater in 10 years. Simple and does what it should without a lot of extras. Great value for the money.
4,Great!,Works as Described! Running in 3ft. plastic pond. Easy to run. Definitely a worthwhile investment for anyone in cold areas.
4,Pond De-Icer,"The product arrived quickly-plenty of time before the temperatures drop and the leaves started falling. I am not sure of the energy consumption, that would have been useful. Other than that, this is exactly what I needed!"
1,Pass on this one,"I bought one of these a few years ago, didn't last the winter, got another one via the warranty and that one broke even faster than the first. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra dollars for a better heater.In Cleveland area."
3,Pond Heater,"Excellent product idea, keeps a hole open in the pond no matter how low the temperature gets(minus 5 degrees in my area). I would have rated it 5 stars except I had one before and it failed after 2 winters, just stopped heating. This is a simple product, heater and temperature switch, I would expect it to last longer. They also made the cord about 3ft shorter on the new model. I still like the product because when it works it works very well."
1,Lasted 36 hours,"I purchased this de-icer based on the mostly good reviews here on Amazon even though there were a notable number of 1-star reviews. I received the order from Amazon quickly, read the instructions and placed the heater. I noticed that after it had built up heat I could see that it was working. The area around the surface ice had melted. Good enough. The next day I went out and thought it odd that a little snow had collected on top of the de-icer and the space around the de-icer seemed to have frozen again. I left things go for several more hours and decided to pull the heater out only to discover that it was no longer working. It wasn't warm at all. So, I made return arrangements with Amazon and purchased a different de-icer.Needless to say, I was incredibly disappointed with this purchase. I had hopes that it would do a decent job but to stop working after a day and a half puts this product squarely in my junk category."
5,Efficient way to winterize your pond,"We bought this item since it only uses 100 Watts, in an effort to reduce electricity costs. With all the negative reviews, I was leary, but now that we've used it on numerous 20-degree nights in New England I'm sold. It keeps a clear area free of ice, and the fish hang out near it. It runs when needed and shuts off when not. What more can you ask for in an inexpensive pond deicer? Give it a try!Obviously, its a floating device, so to the reviewer(s) who complain about it tipping--just keep it balanced and clear of snow/ice."
3,I don't know of anything better.,There are not many choices for a product like this. 100 watts is pretty economical to operate. It works good down to 25F but any lower and it cannot keep the water from freezing. More power should work at a lower temperature but cost more to run.Our previous unit lasted a single season. We'll see if this one makes it through this season.
5,"Better than Same Old, Same Old","As a Catholic, I thought Pence too tough on Catholicism when he advocates paid organ sales against charges of commodifying life but, in the end, I (surprise!) agree that a pro-life policy must favor organ sales and (surprise!) paid surrogate mothers and sale of eggs and sperm. Book is very readable, well-written; has bite. Not everyone will agree with it, but it makes you think. Best chapters at end of book: on cloning, bioethics, and enhancing children. Lots of historical examples. Very up-to-date. My major criticism: He has no sympathy with Catholic view that human embryos have value and should count for something in national law about medical research. Otherwise, good book."
1,"the first ""direct to video"" sequel in the series","Some say the first Police Academy was the best in the series. Some say the first two Police Academy movies were the best in the series. However, most people I know have said that Police Academy 5 was the first flop in the series and here are some reasons why. First of all, any sequel in a series of films that is direct to video is most likely not as good as it's previous sequels. Second, Carrey Mahoney (Steve Guttenburg) is very much missed in this movie. Third, G.W. Bailey does not do as good of a job playing Captain Harris in this film as he did in Police Academy 1 & 4. Fourth, I realize that the plots in the Police Academy moives are not supposed to be taken seriously. However, the plot for Police Academy 5 was just not interesting in the least. Sure, it was a good idea to have Police Academy 5 take place in Miami Beach but everything else pretty much fails for the movie. Skip this one if you haven't already seen it and watch Police Academy 6."
4,Good movie,Love the Police Academy movies love comedies if someone loves wacky comics this is a must own for you yes indeed.
1,Absolutely horrible!,"Well, I'm not a big friend of P.A.-movies, but when Im was a kid ( I mean younger than now) they used to break som good laughs. Actually, the first movie ain't too bad still, but this is without doubt on eof the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Sorry."
4,NOT A DIRECT TO VIDEO RELEASE!!!!!!,"First of all the only Police Academy movie that is a direct to video release is Mission to Moscow.Lassard is being honored at Miami Beach in a convention.Naturally he brings his group of misfits with him.When Capt Harris finds out he was Proctor book them a flight to Miami Beach.This time the comedy is more slapstick,as three guys try to get a video camera that is full of stolen jewels from Lassard(their bags got switched at the airport).Highlights include Proctor skiing and Harris having DORK tanned onto his chest.Police Academy 5 is one of the best sequels."
1,Will not buy from them again,"I placed my order on June 2nd, it is now July 7th and I still have not received my movie! I am frustrated and upset."
5,On My Top 10 of Fine Southern Literature!,My sister and I both received this book as a gift at Thanksgiving. She and I agreed it is the best book we have read in a very long time. Fine writing with characters that just warm your heart. I was sad when it was over. Move over Ya-Ya's - this book is a winner.
3,Terrorism!,"I am told that this is the first movie of the Director. For that, it is well directed.The casting seems quite appropriate.This is the story of a top cop (Aamir Khan-AK) who fights domestic and cross border terrorism. There is treachery, masterminded by Naseeruddin Shah (NS), the ghazal singer. AK and NS have delivered good performances. AK is the hero of this movie. His beau, Sonali Bendre, otherwise much taller than AK, blends in beautifully when they are together and when they sing and dance together!The story is depicted as very real and AK's role brings out the reality of a cop fighting terrorism. He also has a personal motivation for this job.Apart from the super performance of Aamir Khan, and for Naseeruddin Shah's fan following, the movie has not much to offer. But, it is much better than the masala Bollywood movies which don't care much about being ""real"". And for that, it is worth seeing."
4,Town of German Flatts,"Really have enjoyed this book (and the movie) for over 50 years. Grew up in Herkimer, NY (named after General Nicholas Herkimer) and now live in the Town of German Flatts (spelled German Flats in the movie), where the story is to have taken place. I first read the book as a young child and as a result became a huge history buff. From what I learned in school and over the years, the book is a fairly accurate telling of events that happened. Do know that a lot of Revolutionary War history took place in and around the Mohawk Valley."
1,Two words....Barn Fire,"Every single copy of this book needs to be put into one big stack and burned! This is a major rip off. Instead of charging people for this book, the book stores need to pay us to take it off their hands. It's hard to give a sensible review of this novel because the novel makes no sense at all. This is terrible and the author needs to take the advice of her friend who left the note suggesting that she gets an editor. I've got an even better idea. Don't stop at one. Get two or three editors. This needs the work of more than one professional. Maybe the next book will be better 'cause this one's a mutha!"
1,"I just want to help, if I can..............","I recently read most of this newly released novel-Intimacy Between Friends. I must commend the author for having the courage to follow her dream; however, I must also express my dissatisfaction with the book for the following reasons:-Grammatical errors.-Numerous typos.-Extremely weak development of all characters.-What was her goal in writing the book? Are the readers supposed to relate/absorb themselves/fantasize about the characters?-No ""quoted"" dialogue between characters.-No real transition from chapter to chapter.I am no expert in this field by any means but, did the author utilize ""writers' help manuals"" to assist her with her writing? Did she dialogue with other writers to get a feel for ""real"" feedback from readers? Did she have someone who could have objectively critiqued & edited her writing?Good luck my sister! I look forward to seeing your new and improved writing materials in the very near future."
3,Be Encouraged,"Although the other reviews that I've read are harsh, I think that they are intended to be constructive criticism. I agree with some of what they said, however I wanted to leave a word of encouragement to this new author. Congratulations on your first novel. I'm sure writing a book is no small chore and it's hard to get it perfect the first time. On a positive note though, I do want to say that I think your front cover design is unique, your title is catchy and the concept of your story is good. I gave you a star for each of those achievements. Hire an editing team to smooth out the rough edges and it would be a better read."
2,Little is the problem with this,"While I purchased this for its size as I wanted to be able to carry it in my purse, it is too small to write on and the sheets tear off. I never used it after the 3rd day. I had just completed 3 months with Medical Weight Loss and didn't want to pay for their diary refills. I thought this would be a good replacement - it wasn't."
5,Fruitastic!,"Twinings Four Red Fruits Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)Fruit taste is just right - great with a light dessert or snack, or by itself. Glad I tried it!"
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"This collection of (mainly) Chopin tunes is hauntingly beautiful. From the famous notes of Chopin's ""Nocturne in C-Sharp Minor"" all the way through to the billowing sounds of the haunting clarinet solo in ""Moving to the Ghetto,"" these songs flow in accordance with one another. This album is something that should move any person to tears -- it's simply wonderful."
3,Don't buy the soundtrack,"I purchased this CD before I became a classical music buff. It is fine, but not outstanding. I recommend buying some better Chopin recordings instead:Rubinstein Collection Vol 49 - Chopin: NocturnesRelease Date: 08/08/2000Label: Rca Victor Red SealChopin: 4 Ballades, Etc / Murray PerahiaRelease Date: 01/24/1995Label: SonyChopin: Preludes / Maurizio PolliniRelease Date: 10/25/1990Label: Deutsche GrammophonThese discs contain most of the soundtrack recordings and more. They will provide the audiophile or classical music lover with a much richer experience."
5,I love it regardless the movie or the book,"I haven't watch the movie because I missed a chance. I did read the book after I listened to this CD. I love it regardless the movie or the book.I love Nocturne in C-sharp Minor best. After I did read the book, this melody becomes more impressive, because it was the melody that Szpilman played for Captain Hosenfeld in ruined Warsaw.I am surprised to know that it is Ballade No.1 in G Minor that Szpilman played for Hosenfeld in the movie. I won't say Ballade No.1 not good, but I wonder why the change."
1,great selection of classic Chopin,"Originally, I wrote that this was a horrible rendition of Chopin, but...I take it back! I've seen the film (which was amazing and very well done), and I've listened to this CD over and over again. It is a great find, and has many of the well-known peices that we are familiar with. Check it out--it's worth the buy."
3,"Comprehensive, but visually poor","This book covers grammar reasonably well, better than other books I've used; however, its layout and design are terrible. Without bold lettering separating sections or even chapter headers/footers on any of the pages, it is quite difficult to see where one section ends and another begins or to find something quickly when you don't know, if opening the book anywhere, which chapter you are in. Use a highlighter pen, and you'll do alright. Could be a great book with some editing and graphic design work!"
4,Excellent Book,"This text covers a lot of material and even the small grammatical details. Lessons are easily divided and progress nicely. However, the tapes could be developed more as could some of the lessons. Overall, the book is worth it and is better than the smaller and cheaper books, especially if you want to LEARN ARABIC, not necessarily speak a few phrases."
1,"Turgid, Humourless, Boring, AWFUL","I used this textbook as an undergraduate. Happily my instructor was enthusiastic and competent, plus my Hebrew helped, AND I had Lebanese friends who tutored me...because this textbook was just AWFUL. If you're on your own, I suppose you can make it work to get a grounding in bookish Arabic...if you're utterly determined and there's nothing else available."
4,Very helpful but needs updating,"I found the book to be very helpful. The section on the alphabet starts from the easiest letter and builds from there, hammering in the information until you know it forward and backward. The information builds, like language, and is not just thrown out to you. The book was, however, written with a typewriter and, for the writing section, by hand, and so contains a few blotches in the Arabic. With new computer technology, the book as it is written could use a better print. The book contains many exercises that are thorough and will ensure that any student will learn the material. The exercises develop a strong, gradual base of learning."
3,Good Enough For The U.S. State Department Language School,"I am happy to have this language learning tool. However, one needs to also have the CDs that go with it. Happily, I was able to find that vendor; it's not the State Department or the publisher, The Cambridge Press. Rather, you have to contact the University of Michigan, Language Resource Center, tel. 734-764-0424.I only wish that the people writing Arabic script would use larger fonts or something for the Arabic letters so that everything is crystal clear; otherwise you may want have a magnifying glass at the ready."
2,Hard to Digest,I teach Elementary Arabic at the University of Indiana from this book. It is strict grammar translation. The material is very dry and hard for the students to comprehend. It doesn't contain much in the way of actual Arabic material. There is one short dialogue per chapter and the topic of the dialogue progresses from the University to the Office to Famous Arabic Literary figures. Using this book you would never get around to asking someone where the bathroom is or be able to talk about your family. It is best used as a grammar supplement only.
2,Find Something Else,"Though some people obviously find this book useful in their study of Arabic, I have not. I used this book for the first two years of Arabic study and found it trying at best. Yes, Arabic is difficult, however this book does not provide desperately needed grammatical explanations. Also, it teaches you random vocabulary that neglects the essentials that normal language books teach you at the beginning. Not to mention the lack of modern type settings, making it more difficult to read the Arabic text.If you are interested in newspaper Arabic, I recommend Media Arabic published by the University of Edinburgh Press."
4,very helpful!,"When I first approached this book it looked extremely dry and boring, as many people have already commented. My intention was to be able to learn Arabic with a view to understanding the Quran and also for daily use. In this respect the book presents the language very succinctly and logically and endows you with a firm foundation in understanding its structure which allows you to go away and generalise very easily; very useful for further learning. This, I think, more than makes up for a more ad hoc approach. After all, MSA is descended from the Quran whose language is extremely mathematically elegant. It only seems right that we try to understand the language at this depth if we are to truly appreciate it."
1,Horrible layout and typography,"Unless you're an accomplish grammarian you should avoid this book at all costs. It's very poorly printed and chock full of arcane grammatical ""explanations"" that in no way help you learn to speak, read or write Arabic. Avoid!"
1,A frustrating book to learn from,"This book is awful. My professors despise it and are switching next year. I skipped a year of Arabic and came into a class that was in the middle of this book. What a headache trying to figure out the format of the book. As far as the vocab, it is pretty irrelevant to someone who wants to learn to have an actual conversation in Arabic. I know all kinds of words for business and can tell you about Egypt's economic independence upon the Nile, but I have no idea how to ask where the restroom is. The dual for any form of verb is simply not listed. You don't even learn the numbers until half way through the book!"
3,Good College Text,"Abboud's book is as good a place to start as any in learing literary Arabic. I did not use it as a starter - I used Heywood and Nahmad - but Abboud's book goes into a lot more detail, and provides a great deal more drill material.Which is the only negative I can say about it - DON'T try to teach yourself from it. You'll get lost. Intermediate to advanced students can bravely strike out on their own with the other books in this series, which I believe was originally put out by the University of Michigan. But this book is best off undertaken as a college text for a course."
4,Excellent book for the serious student,"This book is for serious students of Arabic, not for the casual tourist who needs to learn how to ask for the restroom in Beirut or where the local nightspots are in Cairo. The emphasis is on *Standard* Arabic, which is closer to the formal language found in the Qur'an, not on spoken, informal use. By the time you finish this book, not only will you be well on your way to diagramming Arabic sentences in your sleep (I'm dreaming in Arabic now and correcting my homework when I wake up), but you'll learn more about English grammar than you ever knew existed. The book does have a few minor flaws in its layout, such as introducing an occasional grammatical concept several chapters ahead of its explanation, but the rewards far outweigh the little inconvenience when you realize you know *why* a sentence is constructed a certain way."
2,Dry and Dreadful,"Arabic has the reputation of being one of the most difficult languages in the world, and this book is one of the reasons. It is accurate, authoritative, and widely-used, but is is also very large, highly-technical, and devoid of visual stimulation. Students can (and do) spend months pouring over this material, only to be dismayed at how little of the book they have completed. In addition, the recorded material, on which many of the exercises are based, is difficult to obtain and prohibitively-priced. The book is useful as a last resort, but fortunately there are now many other better texts available."
1,Churchill's Democracy,"... this book is kind of like Churchill's democracy. It's the worst Arabic textbook out there, except all those other ones.Some of the grammar rules it states are misleading. The vocabulary in the book is in fairly impractical, unless you are going to be spending a lot of time in the office of the director, and on top of that, the font is very bad and at times illegible, which is akin to salt in the wounds of someone not familiar with the alefabet. Out of the 10 or so foreign language textbooks I've used, this is by far the worst foreign language textbook I've ever encountered. On the plus side, it's (sadly) the best one for Arabic out there."
2,STATS: Almost Useless,"A hard to follow book. Maybe its not just the text. Did not do justice to Statistics. In my opinion, not very well written."
3,The 6th edition is almost same as 5th edition.,"This 6th edition is almost same as 5th edition. The only difference is the Micro statistics program domostration which almost of all people are not using. Anyway if you need to buy this book, I'd like to recommend 5 edition. It is cheaper."
1,No SPSS Software,"The book arrived without any SPSS software. Amazon, please do a better job of indicating if a text will or will NOT include the cd. I am returning this."
4,Interesting Product,This is a pretty interesting product and it does exactly what it says it's supposed to do. It can't distinguish between good and bad particles but it definitely works. A bottle of mineral water has a reading of 120 or so and water from one of those non-mineral bottle waters read 13.
5,Nice Product.,"I just purchased this item and I like it. It's a very small gadget that fits in your pocket and it tests small quantities of any type of water. I took the liberty of testing all types of bottled water from Arrowhead, Crystal Gyser, Aquafina...etc. Honestly, I wasn't surprised because some of the bottled water I use to drink tasted like beach water. It works great especially if you wanted to test the purity of your filtered water. Need I say more?"
3,Bueno,"Es muy bueno para saber si el agua es apta para tomar o no, pero cuando el agua no es apta para el consumo este no especifica que esta mal, si es porque tiene muchos minerales o si tiene bacterias etc. ese es el defecto que le veo, por otro lado lo bueno es que es portatil."
3,"OK, but really not my thing ...","I got this album because I have this thing where I have to get all the CD's from an artist once I buy one. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not up to my standards for the girl group 3LW. Yeah, Kiely is a good rapper, but she tries to sound much too tough, and sorry, but her sweet voice is not meant for the first track, ""Christmas In Tha Hood."" I don't understand how you can have profanity-laden numbers and songs about Jesus on one album. Isn't that a bit hypocritical? Don't get me wrong-there are some good songs. the slow and sweet ""Christmas Love"" really makes you think, and ""Ah Hell Nah"" is laugh-out-loud hilarious! but when you're used to hearing the clean music and precise harmonies of groups like Destiny's Child and Play, this just doesn't cut it."
2,Had to Pay Extra Postage,"I was so excited to get Aladdin for our 8 hour car trip. I selected expedited shipping, and paid extra for it. I didn't recieve Aladdin until after our trip, and had to pick it up at the post office because extra shipping charges were due. Very dissappointed that I specifically paid extra to recieve this DVD in a quick manner, and it didn't happen."
1,Still not received. Over 3 weeks late.,I would love to review this product but un fortunately I have yet to receive it. I ordered it over 2 months ago. I am very disappointed with this seller.
1,Disappointed,I ordered this DVD over a month ago and have not received it yet. I ordered another dvd from another company that same day I ordered this one and got it within 3 days. I would not recommend purchasing from this vendor.
1,Viktorija,I'm still waiting for this movie to be sent to me.Already passed 6 weeks... I'm very disappointed with this seller.
1,Aladdin DVD,It does not work and I tried to return it but No one got back to me re:where and who to send it. I am not happy with this purchase and amazon to help me with this problem I am having. I just hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.
1,Strange,"The movie seemed to be new and it arrive quickly, but after having my niece watch it a couple of times it began to pause as if the DVD were scratched. I have cleaned the disk a few times and it does not seem to be scratched, but the picture still stops and jumps randomly. I doubt that this movie was actually original."
4,still good,"So many reviews, just wanted to add my ratings to the overall score.Even years later, this is still funny. Robin Williams was brilliant and the duet (rare in a Disney musical) has got to be one of their best songs."
5,A Whole New World...,"was what we were brought into by the magical 4 four movies that well all know so well--The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. What sets Aladdin apart from the other 3 is its all-out comedy paired with exquisite romance, action and mystique. We were all awed by The Cave of Wonders...the genie's far-out and hilarious antics, and a story of a boy in a Cinderfella type of tale; rags to riches. Jasmine fights for her RIGHT to choose to whom and when she will be married...and a genie longs for freedom A very touching movie that truly deserves its placement in the Platinum Edition series begun with Snow White--Aladdin should be on 2 discs filled with bonus features and completely restored. I'm expecting quite a treat when it is released...This movie will touch you, entertain you...and teach you."
5,Disney Movies,In our family we love watching movies.... so this was just another awesome movie to add into our collection fo movies.
2,:/,"DVD took a while to ship which I expected but it was described as being in better condition than it actually is. I cannot play the dvd all the way through because there are major scratches and the movie either skips into the next chapter or just stops all together, really annoyed."
2,Scratched,"The DVD was loose inside the packaging and was scratched upon arrival. Would not play in PS3, but worked in regular DVD player"
4,Aladdin movie,My nephew loves this movie and it's in the vault so I had to buy it used. It ran perfectly.
2,Destroyed Package,"I received the Aladdin DVD in a timely manner, but when I received it, the outter cover/case for the DVD was destroyed with lose pieces broken off moving around on the inside of the case. The DVD itself was not broken, as far as I can tell, since it's a Christmas gift and I haven't attempted to play it yet, but the packaging was destroyed, which means that I will have to find a new container to store the DVD in, which is a difficult task since all the DVD cases I have are for movies I still possess."
4,ALADIN DVD,WHAT A AWESOME MOVIE FOR KIDS AND CHILDREN!! U CAN NOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE ITS MADE FOR KIDS OF ALL AGEES IM A ADULT AND I STARTED WATCHING THE DVD AS SOON AS I RECIVED IT. THE DVD ANDPACKAGEING IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION A PLUSE AND EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. KRISTEN
3,A Copy?,"I purchased this Aladdin movie for my daughter as we are trying to replace her old VHS Disney movies with DVD's. Turns out that this one seems to be a bootleg copy. Yes, it came in an Aladdin box plastic wrapped but when she went to play it the other day, the dvd player would not read it right. It would only read on her PS2. She researched it and there seems to be no code on it like all the other dvd's that are Disney movies.I'm disappointed that it seems to be bootleg but sometimes I guess people are wanting to make money. It works but not as it should. I will end up replacing it but with one that is more connected with Amazon."
2,aladdin,The vhs tape I purchased for my son lasted about one week. Since he is autistic He doesn't understand when his movies break We wished it would have lasted a little longer.
5,fast,"Fast shipping product as described, very happy.I love Aladdin! One of the greatest disney films of all time, I am so glad that amazon had it."
4,Daughter loved it,"My 7 year old loved his movie. It was difficult to find on DVD, but it made her so happy. It arrived faster than promised too."
1,Horrible,Horrible DVD. Skipd and it is not the original. It is a copy. When it doesn't skip the words do not even match the lips!!!!!Extremely unsatisfied!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,wow,"How awesome is that this film is based on one of the famous tales of 1001 Arabian Nights. I just love it! The animation, the characters and the music, they are all so great. Even though the movie have some complains from the people because of the racial issues back then but I don't really care, I'm Italian and I believe it's an awesome movie.Jasmine is exotic and strong-minded character, how can anyone don't like her ? She's very beautiful character with head-strong personality and she's the only Arabian princess in Disney ever. She's a type of lady who truly believes that she will marry for love, not for royalty reasons and she hate to be treated like a trophy (I totally agree ). Jasmine felt trapped in her own palace and wants to be free; even she's not yet street-smarts on the outside world like Aladdin. But she is after all a fast-learner."
1,"""ALADDIN"" DVD & ""THE LITTLE MERMAID""","I never received this order; I emailed ""Amazon"" to let them know, and I there has been no response from them.I WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM AMAZON, AGAIN!!! BEWARE!!! AMAZON CLEARLY WON'T HELP IF THERE IS AN ISSUE!!!!"
3,I saw this movie many times.,I acted up when I first saw this movie when I was little. I kept getting up and I don't remember whatelse I did. It's been so long ago.
3,My kids love it,"This is a pleasant little story that my three year old kids love every bit as much as Cars or Toy Story. I'm not so crazy about the storyline making a hero out of a street thief, but that will be a lesson for later in childhood!!! I would say, ""Off with his head!!"".....oh well."
1,TERRIBLE,"THE ALLADIN TWO-DISC PLATINUM EDITION THAT I PURCHASED WAS A DUD!! THE DISC WOULDNOT PLAY INITIALLY AND WHEN WE FINALLY GOT IT TO PLAY, THE QUALITY AND COLOR WAS TERRIBLE. THE AUDIO DID NOT MATCH THE MOVEMENT OF THE CHARACTERS AS THEY WERE SPEAKING. TERRIBLE!!!!!!!! I AM VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED. THIS WAS FOR OUR GRANDSON'S FIRST BIRTHDAY PARTY. THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE HE WILL WATCH. AGAIN,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
1,BUYER BEWARE-Never got the product but was charged for it!,"What an awful experience. These people charged me but never sent me the product, never called or sent me any kind of notice. I had to contact them and inquire where it was to wit I was told it was ""on its way"". 4 WEEKS LATER - No product, no refund, just an email (responding to mine) telling me I should ""probably request a refund""!!! Not even ""we've refunded your money"". I am still waiting for them to refund my card (as of yet they have NOT) BUYER BEWARE!"
3,The usual disney fare,"Aladdin is the usual Disney fare. Not a bad movie for sure, but not one I could watch over and over again."
3,Rewatching a Classic,I had forgotten how nice it was to watch a movie with a youngster. In watching this DVD over the week-end with my grandson and watching his pleasure I remembered watching the VHS Tape with his mother years ago. Movies like this will never go out of style.
2,not impressed,"This is a Christmas gift, i bought it ""NEW"" or so i thought. The front cover is scanned or photocopied. There is no new purchase sticker over the top of the dvd case. I haven't opened it yet, I'm still debating if i should, but if the DVD turns out to be a burned copy I will return it."
5,The Genie,Its Disney!!! Whats not to love?! I have almost every Disney animated movie ever made. If you love Disney this is a must have!!!
3,Aladdin,Initial order apparently lost/misplaced. Replacement received in a reasonable time but not until after holidays.
2,THIS WAS NOT AN A ORIGINAL !!!!!!,"This was a gift for my daughter. It was a copy of the movie re-wrapped. If it was a great copy I might not have mind so much, but it wasn't. I will never again buy a movie from another seller on Amazon."
1,Vault this Disney!!!!,"I'm so tired of waiting for Disney to release their movies onto DVD. Then after several months they'll vault them for ten years, by then my son won't care about watching Disney movies. Why can't they make them available to parents on demand? ""Building consumer demand"", sounds like Disney doesn't really want my money anyway. If you're lucky enough to get this movie before the dealers grab them all up (just to charge you triple or more of the original price after it's re-vaulted.)then you're doing good. Pixar was smart enough to say enough is enough when will we, as consumers do the same. Do yourself a favor buy a Dreamworks animated film like Antz, Chicken Run or Shrek. Disney films are way to over-rated. My son really enjoys 'Quest for Camelot' and 'Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius'."
1,Not much talent in this film.,"With the wonderful success of ""Beauty and the Beast"" a movie that i truly admire for being something original from Disney which is VERY rare since the death of Walt. This movie is almost an exact same copy of ""Beauty"".Basically i'm talking about the music score. If you hear the music carefully you'll notice that most of the songs are the same songs as in ""Beauty"" but just altured enough to give it just a slight difference.This is because the talent that comes from Disney is nothing like it use to be when Walt ran the business. So this movie is pretty poor in my estimations. There is nothing original about this music score. Save your money folks,,,it's not worth the plastic it was recorded on."
1,DISAPOINTING...,"This has GOT to be one of Disney's worse films ever made! Even ""The Sword in the Stone"" was better!! I'll admit that the voices are pretty good but the Special-FX are kinda cheesy! ""Aladdin"" just doesn't have that good ol' Disney touch. The storyline is rather dumb, the characters are boring, and the lyrics to the songs are so, sooooo annoying! (I don't know how many times I heard the ""Whole New World"" theme on the radio.) Want something better? Check out: ""Akira""."
5,Fantastic DVD of charming family fare...,"While ALADDIN will probably not stand the test of time with the same resilience that SNOW WHITE, CINDERELLA, BAMBI and PINOCCHIO have, it is still an entertaining and fun filled 90 minutes. The folks at Disney have amassed a fantastic DVD collector's edition with enough special features to amuse any fan for hours and hours and HOURS!The voice talent is excellent and the animation is eye popping. Fans of Disneyana and/or Aladdin in particular will especially enjoy this 2 DVD set."
1,"No response from seller! POOR, POOR POOR!!!!!","I have tried,unsuccesfully, to contact this seller! He has been paid and will not return my emails or respond in any way! You should not allow people like him to sell on your sight! HE,AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM, give Amazon a bad rap!! Please let me know if there are further actions I can take to get my money back or at least the movie I already paid for!! Will NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!!!!!"
1,Worthless to me,"I bought this DVD for my kids and when I came to play it there was an error message in my DVD player and didn't play at all , definately a return"
5,film,"Great film, no skips. Its nice to be able to purchase a Disney film when they are not releasing it. Great experience."
5,love disney,My little girl loves Disney and I knew this was a good one she didnt have and we were unable to find in stores Amazon gives you the oppertunity to get Disney that are retired and I love it I still have a list to purchase. The timelyness in delivery and the price for this product was very impressive
4,good,This was a good quality when I watched it. There wasn't really any scratches on it or anything. But it was not in an actual case that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5
4,For all ages,"This purchase was for my daughters. To be honest, we don't view the extras DVD much, however the main feature is seen many times a week. Recommended to all mothers and grandmothers out there who enjoy the Disney classics as I did when I was young."
2,Aladdin,Bought what was suppose to be new recieved the movie with no wraping and scratches on the movie. It also stops playing toward the end of the movie. Not very happy with this order!
5,Aladdin DVD,My daughter has been enjoying watcing the movie both in english and in french. It arrived on time and in good shape.
1,Bootlegged- Beware!!!!,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! The copy that I received (sent from China) was very obviously bootlegged... several misspellings, clearly a sticker placed on the plastic case, plastic overwrap was suspicious. I wish I'd never ordered this. Beware of products sent from sellers outside the US :/."
2,Not for toddlers,"We purchased this DVD for our 2.5 year old daughter and are very sorry we did so without first watching ourselves. It's full of sword fights and menacing characters. The film's action is cut really fast so it has a pretty high ""over-stim"" factor. We're trying to find our way back to the Jungle with Mowgli! Definitely for older kids."
1,Warning: Sent bootleg DVD's and Refused to refund,"After ordering two dvd's through this seller I recieved two dvd's both of which were very clearly bootlegged. I know the tell tale signs of bootlegs personally but after showing them to several people they all came to the same conclusion. With the pixelated images on the dvd, the cheap case, and the sticker stuck onto the dvd's themselves it's kind of hard not to see that. Upon requesting a refund I was told that I could only exchange my bootleg for another copy of the same bootleg.WARNING: STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER"
1,VERY Unhappy,"Received the item timely and it looked new as advertised. However, the DVD wouldn't play. Contacted the seller and have not received any response back. I will NOT be buying from this seller again unless something is done pretty quickly to remedy this matter. This was a birthday gift for my granddaughter and she was very disappointed, as was I."
4,Great Disney film!,"I think this movie.I think it has great animation,music,acting,singing,etc.I know so much about movies & Im only 14.& I love this movie.I love the disney films from the disney films from 1989-1997 those are the best!they're just so great.Buy this movie its worth while!!!!"
1,Poor Quality,CD had a chip in it that does not allow the last 4 min. of the movie to be played very very disapointed
1,Where is my order?!,"The item was ordered as a birthday gift and was supposed to have been delivered at the latest by the 17th at the latest. It is now 8 days later and no package, no update, no feedback."
1,wow!!,I was seriously disturbed by this film. Who ever wrote this must have been a deeply deranged individual with a really sick mind because some of the scenes in this movie are just down right despicable and gross.
5,Sensational !!,"CLAY AIKEN was magnificent on this DVD!!! He is the reason I bought the Aladdin DVD. Clay Aiken has a beautiful voice and a charming personality, and I wanted to buy and own the Aladdin DVD to capture CLAY AIKEN's contribution/participation/involvement on the Aladdin DVD. What a talent CLAY AIKEN is --- the BEST!!!"
4,second time ...,"i sent this dvd back the first time because the cover was not in good condition, but the second time it was good, but the velcro closer was a little bit offset for some reason. but the dvd quality, itself, was just fine. brings back some good memories!"
5,good as new!!,"Im truly happy with the product, it works as if it where a brand new dvd :)why spend more for a new one if the used ones are just as great plus my toddler loves the movie! i will continue to buy used dvds from this vendor"
5,Got what I had hoped for and got it fast,This product was just as advertised - a brand new still in the package Platinum version of the Disney Classic Alladin - I got it for a good price and I got it fast. Im happy with my purchaseWorldB
4,awesome movie,"The movie was in really good condition. My daughter has watched it numerous times and that automatically makes it worthwhile. It came in a timely mattter, much quicker than I thought and was quite enjoyable."
5,Great..wish it was on Bluray,Excellent streaming video. My son and I enjoyed it from my pc and I'm looking forward to using the app on ps3. Hopefully in the future u can watch from iPad.
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!!,"ALLADIN is one of the best DISNEY movies...the story is a TOTAL classic that everyone knows...the songs and graphics are beautiful!!!REALLY GREAT!...ALLADIN, FANTASIA, THE LION KING and THE LITTLE MERMAID are TOTAL CLASSICS!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
5,Loved it now like i loved it then,This is the Original Alladin. And it is just as good as it was the first time i saw it years ago. Gotta love Robin Williams.
3,my mistake,I believed this was mor than just the first Aladdin. My error. Still the product arrived complet but a little beat up. the art was there as were the other items in the collectors set.
5,My fave Disney movie!,"If you like great comdey, exotic cultures, places, and people, magical fantasies (a genie), fast paced action, great, catchy songs, and the comedic talent of Robin Williams this is definitely the movie for you! No other Disney movie is better than this one!"
5,Aladdin,"Following up on the success of ""The Little Mermaid,"" this handcrafted animated reworking of the Arabic fairy tale by the Disney team features a perfect blend of magic-carpet-ride fantasy, romance, and of course a toe-tapping songbook courtesy of Alan Menken. But the biggest attraction is Williams, in full manic mode as the witty, motor-mouthed, hilariously punchy bottle spirit. Most of his one-liners will fly past younger viewers, leaving adults to appreciate the zip and zing of his pop-culture-referencing lampoons. See ""Aladdin"" with or without the kids; its whirlwind pleasures are universal."
5,a great experience,"O.k ,so i bought this DVD because of Clay aikens renditon of proud of your boy, it is a heartwarming song and i am thrilled to see him sing it and it is wonderfully written,wonderfully sung by Clay as always ,it's worth to simply buy this DVD to just hear this very special song sung by a very special singer.Aladdin is a great story and one of my favourite disney movies but this special edition is wonderfully crystal clear, sounds are amazing and colours just so vibrant and i am very happy i bought it.the jessica simpson/nick lachay remake duet of whole new world does not match up to the original,the original video is there too and it is so nice to see peabo bryson and regina bell.i felt so much of a kid again watching it."
2,:(,"It's an awesome movie, but it always freezes at the same spot :(Kind of disappointing, we just fastforward through it if we catch it in time."
3,Good Movie but not recommended for a 4 year old,"My 4 year old really loves this movie up until when they start fighting... then she becomes scared. I think once she's a little older, she might appreciate it more. The content is a bit much for a 4 year old."
5,A new Alan Menken movie.,"First it was The Little Mermaid, then it was Beauty and the Beast. Now it's Aladdin, another Alan Menken movie. Alan Menken, in my opinion, is a genius. The songs he writes are absolutely wonderfull. Aladdin is a story about a boy who finds a lamp and a genie who can make his dreams come true. I highly recommand this movie. It's full of adventure comedy and music. A great film. Buy it now."
5,"A masterpiece,finally arriving!","Seems like years since I last saw Aladdin,it quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time,and with past Disney hits like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast,Disney had yet another masterpiece in Aladdin.It's a story about Aladdin,a street rat,growing up in Agrabah,who leads a carefree life until he stumbles upon the Cave of Wonders and frees the Genie from his lamp. He also falls in love with Jasmine,daughter of the sultan of Agrabah. But not all is peaceful,for the vizier Jafar,along with his wisecracking parrot,Iago,plan disaster upon the Sultan,Jasmine and all of Agrabah. It's all typical Disney hilarity and the trademark Disney music that we all fell in love with in Disney's classics.I will be for sure snagging this come October when it's release date arrives."
2,Not sure it is a ligit copy,"The movie came in a timely manner and it will work for us. I have two little kids and they dont care that it looks to be a copy and not a disney original. The movie was shrunk wrapped but didn't have the tape type stuff on the inside that disney does nor did it have the same look. The lable on the disk looks pigmented more than a real copy and I am pretty sure it is not really a disney copy but, it works for us and the movie plays fine. It may have a little more red pigment than the original but I am unsure on that. My son plays with our TV settings so when we watched it he may have just played with the buttons and my husband may have fixed it since. Im not too concerned as you can tell. Good enough for a 2 and 4 year old!"
2,Aladdin,I ordered a video on line for the first time and was very disappointed. First it took almost a month to receive. Then when I get it I open it to find that the DVD will not play due to all the scratches and some kind of film on the DVD. This has been the worst experience for me and will not use amazon.com again.
2,Eh,It was advertised as in Used-Like New condition. definitely not. Yes the DVD I'm sure worked but the cover was all bent and ripped. Description did not say anything about such heavy wear and tear to cover. And it didn't come with slip cover -- that should have been noted. I had to sent it back.
2,lousy fit,nice leather and stitching - thin as advertised - however the fit is completely inconsistent....my sample size is (unfortuntely) 3.....one is acceptable the other is not....the third is a different size altogether.....especially the thumbs....clown like really....you can really get spoiled by the quality of most of the products on AzC - however this is not one of them and sniffs of the krapshoot to be had on ebay - beware....
2,Quality Control,"This is my first review.These gloves have a label saying they're made in Pakistan. The quality of the materials is good and thin enough for me (although the leather is a bit stiff).However, my right hand glove has a thumb that is comically large. You can literally fight three of my fingers in that thumb.The left hand size is a lot better; almost a 90% fit to my fingers and thumb.It's not worth my time or money to return, but you may also get unlucky. Rothco does not appear to have quality control standards."
5,good fit,Gloves fit perfect. I wear a size large and I ordered a large. Great fit and leather feels great. I recommend this product.
5,"Snug fit, sensitive touch, great looks","So snug I can use my iPhone with them on yet much less expensive, and more stylin', than others that claim the same."
1,Black Police Tactical Duty Search Gloves 3450 Size 2X-Large,"I wish I could say they the gloves are great. They arrived and I placed them in my duty bag. The package said 2X-Large, but when I removed them in the field and attempted to put them on my hand they where to small. I looked on the size inside the glove and discovered that they where size Large. I ended up giving them to one of my co-workers. I can not fairly rate the gloves..."
5,A gift,The gloves were a gift to a police officer friend. He didn't know they were coming but when he got them he told me he was very very pleased with the softness and the feel.
5,Get gloves...,The gloves are awesome I bought them for my shift for Christmas n they love them...it's like having nothing on your hand n still keep your hands warm
3,Arrived after Halloween.. No speed ship option..,Was looking forward to getting these in time for my costume but showed up on the Friday after Halloween.. I was disappointed ..
5,Weller SPG80L,"Works wonderfully for stained glass, could use a regulator to control the tempature after is has been on for a while."
4,soldering iron for stained glass,"consistent heat, easy to use and clean -- a little expensive but a great product!"
4,Helpful.,"This book was very good. It contains lots of info that you will need. For that reason, I can recommend it. I just had two minor beefs with it, however.First, the authors don't give any advice on transportation (renting limos or other vehicles, getting to and from the church, etc.). I really could have used some help in that department.Second, the authors make one or two assertions that will leave you scratching your head and wonder why they don't tell you why you must do this or that. One example is the author says you MUST address the invitations by hand. Huh? I don't think that is particularly realistic in this day and age when most of us use computers all day long and can no longer print neatly legibly without struggling to do so. And who has the time to do that? Computers love tedious tasks like printing 100 fancy address labels so why not let `em?Nevertheless, my complaints are really minor. The fact is, the book was a pretty useful resource and I do recommend it."
3,"And You'll Feel Like A Dummy, Too...",I will say that there is a lot of information in this book. I will even go further and say it wasn't the worst of the terrible bridal books I recently ordered.HOWEVER-- aside from learning some very dry ettiquette rules and such this book has little to offer. Sometimes it is written in a painfully pretentious manner.Also-- if you want to keep your wedding on a budget don't bother with this book if you're looking to it for valid advice.
3,What a management system book!,"When my husband and I started planning our wedding early this year, we had no idea where to start. We thought of have a proper project management system to manage the whole thing. This was the near perfect book for us. It gave us the information we needed with a little humor to keep us from completely going nuts. We referred to it again and again for nine days. I may even bring it to the wedding just in case but my husband talked some sense into me. We have since sent the book to a friend who is now using it to plan his wedding across the country. And, my husband and I have now started our own family planning!"
2,A book for people who are into weddings,"This book would be useful for people who are ""into"" weddings . If you want do your wedding satisfactory, but also inexpensively (under $30 per a guest) and simply, I don't think you will find creative idears from this book. It is clear that authors experiences are limited to upscale weddings."
2,please give us a book for 'real' brides!,"My fiancee and I paid for our own wedding. I worked full time while I was planning it. My mother lives in another state and couldn't be of much help. Nor could I afford a professional wedding planner (as if!). This book has some nice ideas, but seems the latest in a long line of increasingly-passe wedding planners that assume that you have all the time and money in the world to organize and pay for your wedding. When will publishers wake up and realize we don't?"
2,A waste of money,"This book is neither fish nor fowl. On the one hand, it doesn't provide much by way of money-saving tips (instead, try Bridal Bargains by Denise and Alan Fields) or practical, real-life information. On the other hand, it's not one of those glossy, ""perfect wedding"" coffee-table books with pictures that you can drool over. It has a little bit of everything, with nothing covered in any detail and nothing really new or insightful."
2,"Good reference, but outdated","Wedding trends change every season, if not every month. It's hard to print a book that can keep up with the ever-changing customs, traditions, styles, etc. This book was useful as a reference - such as for financial issues, tips, advice, seating arrangements, etc. However, it is already very outdated in terms of what is ""in"", who is expected to pay for what, etc which is what - i think - brides (and grooms!) would be most interested in."
4,"It was so helpful, I never got to read it!","I purchased this to get some ideas and tips on planning my own wedding. Shortly after i got it, I loaned it to a friend who is also getting married, and she liked it so much and used it so much that didn't get it back until several months later! She really got some good ideas from it and was very grateful that I had loaned it to her. She was very glad she'd had it as a reference."
5,Saved my wedding day,"I loved it. It was so informative, funny and helpful that I breezed through the wedding to the envy of all my friends. I have never found a book to be so helpful,easy to read and now give it to all my friends. There was nothing that this amazing book didn't cover. I can't recommend this book highly enough. It's the best."
2,"typical of its genre--long on ideas, short on reality","I thought this was a good deal like a lot of the wedding books I bought for my recent wedding. It has lots of cool ideas and much good information on wedding planning. What it *lacks* (like so many other books) is *any* sense of proportion: the sense that most brides are working with a limited budget and have limited time that they are willing to devote to the wedding planning. Come on--for most of us it's a wedding, not the invasion of Normandy! Perfectionistic princesses have enough wedding planners. What we need is one for the rest of us. The only book of that type I've seen is ""Weddings for Grownups,"" which I DO unconditionally recommend for all brides."
5,"No question, the best wedding book around","Weddings For Dummies is the only guide you'll need to making your big day perfect. The authors have a sensible approach and they provide all the details and tricks of the trade that would take a lifetime of wedding planning to learn. If that wasn't enough, the material is presented in a easily accesible format and with enough humor to keep things in perspective. A great gift for the bride (or groom) to be. Get an extra one for the parents. They'll thank you for it. You will get a big return on your investment in this book. I practically wore the covers off of mine."
4,Fantasy Weddings,"This book is great as far as letting you know all the steps and parts that go with a wedding, very clear, does a pretty good job overall.My main complaint is that this book doesn't help you out much if you're planning anything less than the ""typical"" $18,000 wedding. There are a few budget-saving tips, but there are just as many suggestions that are just an outrageous amount of money to spend on one day."
2,Not for those with limited budgets and time,Marcy Blum has written a book for those with enough time and money to obsess about details. It's Martha Stewart without the gorgeous photographs. This frugal and down-to-earth bride didn't find it helpful.
4,Kind of all over the place,This does not go in chronological order of what to do when you get engaged. It skips all over the place. Some parts seem outdated as well; it leans traditional in terms of ettiquette (who does at-home cards?!!!) and is definitely for the more mainstream bride.Overall not the most helpful book by any means. Just go on blogs!
5,Extremely helpful,This book gave me so many tips that I never thought to think of. I now have confidence my fiance can plan a fabulous wedding.
5,Great book!,"This is a very detailed oriented book, great for those who are starting all the planning from the very beginning or even for those a little more advanced. Very helpful!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.,"Not only does this product leak like a sieve, (Round tubing in square holes? please...) Theone way valves that are supposed simulate circulation DO NOT WORK correctly."
4,The Global Trap,I've read this book when it first was published in Poland five years ago. The first thought that came to my mind was: How the hell could I have been so blind not to see what is going on in the world? There is no need to write about this book. You just have to read it! The question is: What can we do not to go to the 20:80 formula? And can we still do anything?
1,save your money!!!!!,"this book is .....i can't think of a word beside terrible, really really bad!!! ok, i liked tokyo mew mew, like other fans when i heard that there was tokyo mew mew a la mode coming out, i was happy! but..wow save your money, ..... i hated the new character, berry was so annoying!(like my spelling)"
3,Tokyo Mew Mew A La Mode,"Tokyo Mew Mew A La Mode is a good book. But I was very disapointed when I finished this series cause it wasn't as good as Tokyo Mew Mew. There were no aliens, no Kish.Also, it seemed liked Mint, Lettuce, Pudding, Ichigo, and Zakuro were not important characters of the book. There were a lot of things missing in the Tokyo Mew Mew A La Mode series that I liked in Tokyo Mew Mew.-Chibi"
2,BERRY'S THE NEW LEADER!!!????,"What in the world happened here? Ryou is sooooo STUPID!!!! I don't like Berry! I wish Ichigo's powers will come back, I don't want Berry to take her place and over-power Ichigo!!! Ichigo's my favorite character!!!! Ugh! I'm so mad! >:( I liked the original series way better. >:o But I'm still checking out the next volume, just because I want to see what happens to Ichigo and if she beats up Berry to show her her place! LoL"
3,Police Academy 3 Back in Training,"A Very Funny film with some hilarious moments,not a bad movie but not great, you have bobcat in there.Bubba Smith and Winslow being the funniest and coolest of all."
2,THE DOWNFALL BEGINS,"IN THIS ONE, THE CREW FROM THE FIRST TWO GO BACK TO THE POLICE ACADEMY TO TRAIN NEW CADETS. NOT REALLY THAT FUNNY. THE SERIES SHOULD'VE STOPPED AT 2. THIS SERIES IS GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER WITH EACH SEQUEL THAT PASSES. BUT THE SEQUELS WOULD GO ON TO GET EVEN WORSE AS THE YEARS COME. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE BETTER SEQUELS."
3,If you only see one Police Academy film see this one!,"Ok, in all fairness the original Police Academy will probably always be the funniest, but if you never get the chance to see parts, 2,4,5,6,or Mission to Moscow, you're really not missing anything...Part 3 does have some original funny moments and is hence my personal favorite of an otherwise overrated and overplayed set of movies!..You may disagree but part 3 really is the only truly funny one."
3,Shawn Weatherly and Brian Tochi join in.,"Directed by Jerry Paris.Original Cast members returning: Steve Guttenberg, Bubba Smith, David Graf, Michael Winslow, Marion Ramsey, George Gaynes, Leslie Easterbrook, Scott Thompson, Brant Van Hoffman, Bruce Mahler, Debralee Scott, George R. Robertson and Georgina Spelvin (yes, she was that ""Miss Jones"" with the Devil).Returning from the second film: Art Metrano, Tim Kazurinsky, Bobcat Goldthwait, Lance Kinsey, Arthur Batanides and Andrew Paris.The returning sergeants who we laughed at as Cadets a couple years ago return to the Academy to help the Commanders with the new in-coming cadets, Tim Kazurinsky, Bobcat Goldthwait, Debralee Scott, Andrew Paris, along with Shawn Weatherly, Brian Tochi and David Husband.Runs: 86 min.The next film in the series: Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol (1987)."
2,I feel like a a foolish fish.,"They used the old bait and switch tactic on me. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt; apparently they the company (don't even remember the name, photoelectric or something) had ran out of this product, yet continued to take orders for them. They offered a refund, or I could wait and receive the cables when they arrived into inventory. I week later I received some non-penguin united brand cables in the mail. They work, and my LN46A950 says that they are displaying in progressive scan. I'm not sure if the actual ones I was trying to order were better or not, so I chose not to complain. Still the ones I received are not gold plated or magnetically insulated. Whatever."
2,Lame drawings,"The title says it all, the drawings are lame, way different than the ones in the front of the tin"
3,"Useful, but a little disappointing","I have to agree with a previous reviewer who described this book as bloated. Although I don't have any problems with the organization (the presentation of essere and avere is a bit scattered, but still logical), this book is 150 pages longer than my Langenscheidt's Pocket Spanish Grammar, which I love, mostly due to unwanted advice on form letters. The best features of the series are the handy size, along with the vinyl cover and the strong binding, which make the books good traveling companions. This one, however, is in need of serious editing. Still, it's OK for a basic grammar reference."
1,Badly organized and incomplete,"This grammar book is a big disappointment. I bought it because of my positive experience with other Langenscheidt's foreign language texts. But this bloated and disorganized text should be avoided. Astonishingly enough, the conjugations for ""avere"" and ""essere"" are not included in the appendix of irregular verbs. You have to look them up by tense and mood as they appear piecemeal elsewhere in the book! The explanations for the uses of prepositions (da, di, a and per) are extremely skimpy and leave out important differences in function. There are many other deficiencies in the book. Result: I have ordered two other grammar texts, in the hope of getting something decent."
4,I like it,"This product was nicely finished, I gave it as a gift to my son in law who is very picky but really enjoyed the box."
3,Watch Box Review,"The watch box burlwood storage chest has a nice finish. However, the lock is poor quality, it actually moves when I turn the key to lock it."
5,Quite Nice!,"It complemented my other cases very well. Nice finish, well made.Not for big over sized watches, just normal, (human size), pieces.Highly recommended."
4,20 watch box,i gave it to my husband for his birthday and he was delighted. good and sturdy. liked having the drawer
5,I liked it quite a bit.,"As far as ghost found footage movies go - this is one of the best I've seen. The acting is decent and they use a cast of nobodies to make it seem more real. More so, the lack of credits and information provided on the DVD artwork went to great lengths to make the viewer believe the footage is real... I love stuff like that. As for the movie itself, it is clearly trying to cash in on Paranormal Activity fans but this movie is not a direct copycat. It mirrors an episode of Ghost Hunters much more then any found footage movie. Its also nice that this flick is based off true events of a real killer. My only beef with the film was the needless nudity... Very lame and took away some credibility. Other then that I recommened it very much for fans of Blair Witch / Paranormal Actvitiy type movies. And if you're looking for something similar, check out The St. Francisville Exeriment."
1,8213: Gacy House,"Seriously, I would have been more inclined to get caught up in this suspensefully told tale like I did with the Fourth Kind if the opening notes would have been consistent with the images portrayed. Don't tell someone the house you are about to study and visit for paranormal activity is built on the site of a house that was razed in the early 1980's with a new house being built on the same site shortly thereafter and then open on a period Victorian house. Sorry, but I lost interest after that."
3,"So,If JOHN WAYNE GACY had lost his house to banks !","Stars : Mike GaglioDirected by: Anthony FankhauserMaybe SCARIER than' Paranormal Entity',Just because we recognize this ghost as pure evil.Great group of ghost hunters who literally gave their last breath to entertain us.Not a fan of poster,Could have used some clown ghost image ?Need to google the real house that John Wayne Gacy did his thing in and see `Wassup?'.All the doors and closets leading nowhere reminds one of ` Mystery Of The Winchester House' too.Some of the ghost hunters were alot rounder and softer than Gacy was used to,Guess that's a cop-out to reality television ratings."
1,Bait and Switch!,"I was led to believe that this was actual police footage of hte Gacy house as they combed the place for boides and other evidence. This is nothing more than those ridiculous ""ghost hunters"" in a fake Gacy house and this is a bunch of BS!!!!!!!! I hate getting taken. Don't lie to people about what it is just to make a dollar. I am tired of these ""ghost hunters,"" ""vampires"" and ""zombies!!!"" They are not real, adults! This movies sucks and do not waste your time even hearing about this let alone renting it..."
1,Beware,"This is not the real YLT at all. Definatley their worst effort, just a curio. With YLT giving us some country influenced ditties. Instantley forgettable. Buy every other album by them first, and get this at the end if you must. If you like country. Then go ahead. But beware!"
3,Understandable but inconsequential off-ramp,"An older disc in a more traditional, subdued form, the album competently pays homage to the soft classics they cover and emulate, offering yet another angle for the band to mine in a diverse catalog. But overall, despite a lingering sweetness, FB remains ploddingly dull, moreover in the face of spacey textural advantages utilized on further albums."
5,"Amazin, Reminds me of the Byds","An excellent album. I am a fan of ""I Can Hear The Heart Beating"" and ""Then NOthing Turned Into Somethin"". This cd is entirely different. Yo La Tengo pulls a complete 180, and sticks mainly to covers mixed with some original stuff. It has a misty, thematic feel to it, a certain aura of perfectly arranged acoustic guitar and slippery vocals. ""What Comes Next"" evokes the Byrds, especially their ""Notorious Byrd Bros."" phase. An excellent buy, sit back n enjoy."
2,Too country/americana for me,"This doesn't sound like YLT at all. If you like a bunch of slow, acoustic, sad songs this is an album for you.Maybe it's the fact that this record is a good attempt to pay tribute to some unknown bands that it gets a couple of stars...I honestly, don't get it."
3,Difficult to release fudgesicles from mold,"Purchased this item for the purpose of making low sugar fudgesicles. It made them okay, but releasing them was a bit of a trial and error experience. Still don't have it right and I have a fair amount of experience at this sort of thing. Guess I'll donate these to the Church. I would not recommend it to a friend."
5,popsicle DIY,"The original Tupperware product of our youth was good.This is much better.The handles are more substantial, the ""cups"" larger and they sit in the receptacle more securely.It appears nearly indestructible,and will likely last for years.Well worth the price.Now I can get guilt-free,customized, made at home frozen treats anytime and at little cost."
3,Good but huge,"These are good pop molds, but saying they are big is an understatement they are huge. So. Big that they are longer and wider than my iPhone, now if I had known that prior to purchasing I would have passed on these"
4,"Rather good, could use finish","Overall I liked this product. It was easy to wash, fill and remove popsicles. There were still some rough bits on the plastic though. Nothing that can't be fixed at home, but it was annoying to find with the first use."
5,"Fun, Fun Fun!",I bought these to make ice pops for my grandchild but have ended up loving it myself! I decided to put nonfat fruit flavored yogurt in one and they work great for that too. The quality is great and the pops come out nice and even.
3,alright,"I think I liked the idea of being able to make my own popsicles with fresh fruit and yogurt, but once I had them, I never really found the time/energy to actually do it.I did try to make jello pops with jello mix one time, and they would not come out of the plastic mold once frozen. I ended up using a fork to eat it out. Also, I accidentally dropped one while taking it out of the freezer, and the yellow handle part cracked in two. dissapointed..."
4,Pretty Good,"These make beautiful popsicles.However, they can be hard to get out of the mold - even if you run them under water first. The plastic is thick and durable, but I think it also has some insulation properties - ice pops are not such a big issue, but none sugary, none ice pops (like pudding pops, etc.) take some work to get out of the mold. And 2 cups of liquid fills up exactly 5 of the 6 moldsI've made pudding pops, juice pops and yogurt pops with these successfully. They are very sturdy and easy to use."
3,Not my favorite,Not my favorite. These are just ok. It took a few tries to successfully create some good popcycles. Very basic at the most
4,Tovolo Pop Molds are great!,"The Tovolo pop molds are great -- nice size (perfect for adults), removable stand a plus, easy to fill, sturdy 'stick', easy to remove the frozen treat -- the only reason I downgraded one star is that the mold breaks if dropped when frozen! The very first time we used them, one dropped on the floor and the mold broke -- I now have an extra insert and no mold. However I was prepared as I purchased THREE sets and have already recommended them to friends."
3,not for kids--messy!,"These are cute and are probably fine for adults, but they are not great for kids. First, they're really big, so kids can't finish the popsicle before it melts all over. Second, and more importantly, drips accumulate in the little cup where the handle is and then spill out onto you as you're eating. This seems like a big design flaw. My kids were coated with sticky drips."
3,Decent product for the price,"This is a great product, especially if you are dieting. My only problem with the product is that each pop has a gully to catch drips. The problem is that then you can spill the liquid on your clothes. The tupperware brand does not have this little gully and you must wrap a paper towel around the base to catch drips, but it doesn't collect and spill on you. The tupperware pops are $25 and not worth the extra money."
2,Way too big pop molds,"I only read other reviews about how well-made it is. How it's easy to use, etc. I should have read the reviews more comprehensively. These are extremely big pop molds. It's overwhelmingly big for young children (2 and 5 yr old). It might be good for teenagers and adults. But there should be a note somewhere how much oz. of liquid it holds and freezes etc. There is product dimension for pop mold stand which holds them. But that doesn't give me any idea how big these mmolds are. When I opened the box, we were disappointed how big these molds are. Purchasing something like this online without viewing in real life is a risk."
3,A little too big,It's great to be able to make your own healthy pops. I didn't care that much about the shape of these. They didn't leak. They work fine. But thy were a little big so I gave them away.
4,Tovolo Groovy Ice Pop Molds,These popsicle molds aren't bad. The only complaint I have is that it needs to sit @ room temperature for approx. 10 minutes before it can be removed.
5,Ice Pop Molds,"These pop molds are wonderful. Was a bit skeptical after ready bad reviews, but went with them anyway because of price. Very pleased with them. Have had no problem at all getting pops out of molds. Just follow instructions and squeeze middle as you pull them out. Size is great also, my four-year-old had no problem with it."
5,great deal,"These pop molds are just right. People who say they are too big, must have toddlers. They are just the size i remember from when I used to buy frozen pops. Love them"
5,Best pop makers on the market!,these things are really great. They make huge ice pops and if you are a big family it really does help save you some money buying the kids treats. More importantly they can have fun with it and make up their own treats. This is a really great idea.
4,Large,Large enough that you won't go back for another. I gave it a 4 as it is a little difficult to get out what is put inside but I would guess they all are.
5,Tovolo Groovy Ice Molds,"Great except too large for kids-toddlers or preschoolers-even my ten year olds throw them out after 1/2 is gone. However, very sturdy item:)"
5,Good quality,"I read many reviews before settling down for this one. Most of the reviews for the other similar products have to do with the quality, mostly because they are flimsy. This one is really sturdy and it feels like it will last for some years. The size is generous, and the stand makes it much easier to fill and store. I will highly recommend it."
1,Fell out of freezer and broke!,"I just received these popsicle molds a few days ago, have never used the frozen smoothie popsicles...a few minutes ago the whole set fell on the floor, and every single mold broke....do not buy these!I went to Target and bought two less expensive popsicle molds, about $3.00 each, much better, more stable, more flexible plastic. Popsicles release easily."
2,Too hard to get out,The stand is nice and can take 1 out at time... we make popsicles with a bit of jello and kool-aid - really hard to get out. Run under hot water and wiggle for 2-3 minutes and hope the stick doesn't break or pull out.
2,too big for toddlers and small children,"These are great molds, BPA free, well designed, sturdy, good-looking, except they are.... huge!I read the review saying they are too big for small kids and I got them anyway, thinking, how big can they be? Answer: as long as my todder's fingertips to her elbow. If an adult had a popsicle this big it would be the size of a shoebox.Even if she could hold them, they need a lot of juice to fill, likely to melt (and make a large puddle!) I took a photo, don't see a way to upload here."
1,Damaged & now can't return,"I live in Ohio and we don't get blazing hot temps around here until late June and into July most summers. I bought these molds this spring and just opened the box to use them for the July 4th weekend. They have some kind of black oil or something all over them -- like it was rubbed on something in the factory or got caught in a machine at the factory and marred. Every single one had this stuff and I have tried to get it off but can't. Amazon says I missed the window for return by three weeks. This was a very short window of time in which to return something and I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with Amazon on this point. Beyond that, the picture they have and the actual item don't look a thing alike. I would beware and look elsewhere for ice pop molds."
1,NOT HAPPY,Very unhappy with purchase. The ice pop molds are entirely too large for an infant popsicle ! They were also over priced.
2,Damn it! Hard to open.,"I wish that somewhere in ANY of these reviews that even one person had mentioned that these ice molds are not good for people with weak or injured hands or wrists. I have a torn wrist, and now that the pop is frozen, I cannot open the damn thing without further injuring myself. Looks like I'll have to wait for the ice to melt to get it open, so what's the point?Will be returning this and continuing to purchase Fruit Floes from Trader Joe's.Such a disappointment...I waited so long and eagerly for these to arrive...so bummed.PS. I gave it 2 stars because I can tell that this would be a good product for someone who has healthy hands and wrists."
1,Popsicle mold,The popsicle molds are very large - too large for young children. I bought this product so that I could make popsicles for my young (1 1/2 to 7 yrs. old) grandchildren. The popsicles turn out to be as large as those one would buy from an ice-cream truck. I couldn't tell from the picture what size the molds were. Sizing information in the write-up would have been helpful.
4,Works well but BIG!,These molds work really well for their purposes.The good:- BPA free- Cheap!- Very sturdy- Drip tray definitely helps- Easy to clean and useThe bad:- Really large sizes - may be too big for kids- Popsicle stick to the mold somtimes
4,A good product,My kids love making these popsicles. The only thing I can say is that they are awful big for kids. My kids can never finish one of these because they are so large.
5,Exceptional Quality,"These molds looked flimsy in the photo, but they are sturdy. I use them daily and there is nothing I've found that comes close to being this good. They are easy to handle and stand up straight in the base, no tipping. Easy to wash, they don't stain and the pops slide out of the sleeve handily after being put in warm water for a few seconds. Best of all, the molds are individual. The sticks stay in place, too. I make fudgesickles by doubling diet packaged hot chocolate (Nestle or Swiss Miss), letting it cool and pouring it in the molds. Each mold holds 1/2 cup liquid ...terrific! Cristal Light is great, too (mix it a little strong). Have treats all day and stay skinny!"
3,These are huge!,"I was very excited to find pop molds online since I couldn't find them in the store. All the great reviews and the price helped me decide on these. What I didn't expect was the size of the mold. I thought these would be about the size of a regular popsicle that you buy at the store, but they are easily double that. These are fine (or too big) for an adult eating the pop, but my daughter can not eat this much!The things I really like about this mold are the ease of use and the drip tray on the stick. They are easily cleaned and stored."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"After reading the reviews here, I purchased a set of these. I LOVE the size. V-8 makes a smoothie drink mix, that I mix with almond milk and cut up chunks of fresh fruit and put in these molds and they turn out VERY yummy!! I can't wait to try all kinds of fun things with these. I also used the suggestion of running warm water over the molds, prior to sliding them out. I plan on buying another set, for even more variety of stuff to make. I would DEFINITELY recommend these!!"
4,Tovolo ice pop molds,"The freezable ice pop molds are an inexpensive, perfect and simple way to make attractive summertime treats for children (and others). Much more economical that an electric self-contained refrigerant unit."
3,huge,when i saw these and the reviews i thought it would be a good buy but when i got them they were huge! way bigger then an average pop size. also they are not sturdy enough if they are near something that will knock them over then they spill everywhere. if you use them keep them away from other high traffic hands in the freezer.
2,sticks to the mold,This is my first time with my own popsicle molds; I've tried two batches and I have the hardest time to get the popscicles out of the molds!!
4,"Great, but too big for tots","I was looking for a really cool mold to make healthier fruit pops for my toddler this summer. This mold is truly great in quality and makes unique grooves in the popsicles. However, it does make huge popsicles. The popsicles are almost twice the size than most in this similar mold shape. My toddler (22 months) gets tired of holding the popsicle and has to put it down to rest her hand. Not what a popsicle eating experience should be like for a kid."
3,Only OK,"We purchased these Popsicle Molds so we wouldn't waste leftover fruit smoothies. After freezing, it is difficult to remove the popsicle from its mold, even after running it under hot water. It's OK, but one set is plenty."
2,Absurdly expensive and bulky to store,"$12.99 for a half-dozen molds is outrageous. The base is convenient to hold the molds upright, but it's size is awkward and it does not fit well in a conventional freezer. These are durable, but they should be - because they are very over-priced. Count on these taking about .75 cubic feet of storage space in your cabinet no matter how you try to manipulate them. Will keep these, but disappointed."
3,Basic Popsicle mold.,"I bought this mold because I liked that it was simple and it wasn't too expensive. Great for basic Popsicle and I do like how it can be taken a part for the dishwasher. I'm not rating it too high though as it does take more space than I thought in the freezer as its wide, and tall."
5,Best popsicle molds ever!!!,"I've used many popsicle molds before finding these gems and these are by far the best shape, easiest to use and clean, and most practicle I've ever used. I just ordered 4 more sets!EBH"
3,not as good as I hoped,"This pop mold is not quite like what I expected.I used to use some small cylindrical metal ones when I was a child,so that is the only one I can compare with.1). The molds are quite big so they won't fit in my freezer with the tray provided. I had to put them in one by one.2). It is very hard to take the pop out of the mold. I have run water over it, robbed it with my palms. Still not easy.3). The cover part on the stick will have quite some melted ice deposited there, and when you tilt the pop, the liquid will flow out and cause a mess on your clothes if you are not very careful. And do not fill the liquid too high, the part near the cover is hard to get to when you eat.Overall, not a bad product, but can have a better design."
5,Makes great fruit popsicles !,"I bought two of these, one for me and one for the grandkids. Very easy to use and popsicles come out great !"
4,Just like when I was a kid,"In the summer time, I love a popsicle or ice cream in the evening. When I was a child, we had a similar product. One day this occurred to me, and I realized it would probably be cheaper to buy juice (or make smoothies or freeze soda or anything of the like) than to buy popsicles. These have been nice. I thought I ordered the star shaped ones, which I thought would be fun to eat, but I see that I did not. That was my fault. The only problem with these is that even with the stick guard, when you tilt the popsicle to your mouth melted juice leaks on you. Despite my best efforts and quick eating, I have not found a way around this. I hope with more pratice I will not get dripped on. But it is a small price to pay for a tasty pop. I have bought Juicy Juice to fill them and the Strawberry Kiwi flavor was tasty! I want to try coconut juice next with pieces of coconut."
3,Adult sized popcicles,These molds do work very well and the popcicles are easy to remove. The only problem is they are way too big for children. Definitely adult sized popcicles!
2,Pretty Mediocre,"I got these during Black Friday week for a pretty good deal off of Amazon. That being said, it's pretty impossible to get the popsicle out of the mold! I use hot water, but I still end up taking off the top part of the popsicle. Meaning, I end up with 3/4 of a popsicle. Which is fine, I keep my world in perspective. It's a popsicle. Not sure I would recommend them though."
4,Ice Pop Molds,These ice pop molds work great as long as you run them under warm water before taking the 'pop' out of the mold. I've used them to make a coffee-mocha ice pop and orange juice pop. I bought 2 additional sets as gifts
5,Terrific Item for Ice TreatS,"This item is awesome for making frozen delights for adults. The size is adequate to satisfy adults and no doubt teens as well. We enjoyed the first set so much I purchased a second set. I put a pound of fresh strawberries in a blender along with 2 4oz. cups of strawberry yogurt, 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar, about 2 oz of strawberry-kiwi juice and use the liquify button. It makes about 8 pops at a time. We usually (2) have one apiece per night.All kinds of fruit work wonderfully well. These are well worth the money."
3,Popsicle maker,"They work as advertised. I found similar products at a local kitchen supply store at a lower price, but I don't regret the purchase."
2,Nice product with minor flaws,"I agree that these are pretty large for children. However, the more serious problem, at least for me, was that there were small plastic strings and uneven plastics around the edges and holes on the sticks. I happened to find those bad finishing and I had to cut them out with a knife. Still there are sticking out parts inside the drip protectors. The outer mold looks perfect though. The inside finishing should have been better with that price and brand.I think the quality of the inside and outside molds should have been switched."
3,Good product but too big for little kids,"I am only giving these 3 stars because I bought them for my children (really, how many adults make popsicles all the time for themselves anyway?) and they are huge! Way too big for small children, maybe they can have them when they are 10. They do come out of the mold very easy once ran under warm water and i like the shape of them and how you store them. So if you are buying for yourself or older children...perfect...but if this is for younger children, move on."
2,Tough to remove pop from mold,"These work as expected, however it was rather difficult to remove the frozen pops from their molds. We had to resort to 20 seconds of running each mold under hot water to free its pop."
3,Tovolo Ice Pop Molds,"These molds are very functional and have a good capacity. However, be careful not to drop the molds on a hard surface because they will crack easily near the bottom and become useless. I have lost two molds already on the second time I have used them."
4,Great!!,"I ordered these and was suprised that they were better that I thought.Nice product, fast shipment. Ordered two more. Nice to have on these summer days."
4,Nice Product,"It arrived earlier than I expected and perfectly packaged. It was very easy to use, though it did take me a while to realize that the instructions were written on the outside of the box. The instructions say that you should leave the pops in the freezer for 4 or more hours. When I tried this, the pop came out of the Popsicle. But when I left it in the freezer overnight (around 12 hours) it came out perfect, you just have to run it under warm water for a few seconds and squeeze the sides to get it out. It may take a while to get it out if you leave it in the freezer for too long, though."
5,pop makers,"I'm experimenting with making my own snack bars. These are such a nice size for a small treat after dinner. You don't have to mix up a huge amount to see if it's going to work. I'm diabetic so am trying different recipes with a sugar substitute, sugar free jellos, yogurt, etc. The tray holder keeps the molds standing up nicely and I like the fact that I don't have to buy the wooden sticks. Everything is so convenient."
3,"good, but one problem","They're fine, except that the design of the mold makes it difficult to eat the bottom of the popsicle. The ""drip-catcher""-well part of the mold should be detachable from the stick. You can't get your tongue around the base of the popsicle with that well thingy there, (unless you're very dexterous!)"
4,Fun and Healthy!,"These molds make nice big popsicles. We love making them with grape juice, very refreshing! I only stopped short of giving them 5 stars because I did have trouble getting a couple of the popsicles loose from mold, and I pulled stick out trying to do so. BUT the next time I just ran them under warm water to loosen them. I never run out of popsicles now, especially when the kids get sick and I can't make it to the store."
1,can not get these things to work,"I have given up on using these pop molds. I tried a few times but the content of the popcicle gets stuck to the mold and I can not pull them out, no matter how hard I try. I ended up breaking a few and shoving the rest in the back of my kitchen cabinet."
1,did not receive,"The item was not in stock, so I received work gloves instead...which I did not order. It took them a long time, like 2 weeks to resolve it. They finally did, a lot of frustration though in mean time!"
3,Disappointment,"First off, I had to wait 2 months for these to be delivered. Not sure what the delay was, but it did not start off well. The good point, I had forgot about the order by the time they came...it was like a gift (one I paid for 2 months earlier). One of the plastic molds broke the first time I used them. The others are still working. The price is low and I like that fact I can make health snacks. I do not have a lot of faith in these holding up."
4,Great Popsicles,"Popsicles molds are good sized, seem very durable. The handle catches juices so it doesn't drip on your hand."
4,Work well...,"These pop molds work well. Just remember, when you take them out of the freezer, run the iced part under warm water for about 10-30 seconds. And don't fill them to the absolute top. Enjoy."
5,Low-Carb Recipe Suggestion,"Fill blender with around 2-2/3 cups water. Add 1/2 cup party peanuts (around 12 grams carbs) and pulverize. Then blend in 1 pack of sugar-free vanilla or chocolate pudding mix (around 28 grams carbs). Then blend in 6 ounces of low-carb vanilla yogurt (around 4 grams carbs). A 4-cup mixture will fill 8 pop molds. The nutritional math works out to around 5.5 grams carbs and 70 calories per pop (depending on the ingredients used).The pulverized peanuts produce a small-crystal ice texture. Thawing the pop in the refrigerated section for 2-3 hours before consumption results in an ice cream like texture.To conserve mold-release running tap water, fill a small container with hot water and consecutively immerse all the molds in one session. Place the pops on a plate in wagon wheel configuration and return to freezer."
3,Just okay,"These molds are a bit too large for me. The stick is so long that I couldn't eat the popsicle to the bottom. I actually cut each stick down by a couple of inches. Now they work great. They are too large for a child, but a good size for adults."
4,Great Product,"These molds are excellent quality-nice plastic and BPA-free!! The bottom part of the popsicles are a bit hard to eat. I'm glad I bought them, and would definitely recommend them."
2,Wish I returned it,Its so hard to make good tasting pops at home and this doesnt really help. Save your self the trouble so buy them at the store.
4,Well made,I like these pop molds. Just haven't found the right recipe for healthy pops. I would recommend this to someone looking for this type product.
5,Thinking about buying a second set,"I love experimenting and making my own Popsicles! These molds are pretty much perfect, the only things you need to be aware of is that you have to run them under hot water to get them out, and that they do take up some room in your freezer if you put them in their stand. Also, they are a bit on the large side, but that makes them great for adults. I have found all kinds of recipes to try, but my favorites usually involve fresh berries. Basically make a smoothie and put it in these and it will be amazing."
5,We want more Fran Fine!!,"I have always loved this series, and I'm glad it's been made available on DVD. No commercials, no cuts, and timeless humor. What more could we want? We all waited too long for Season 3 to come out. I hope we won't have to wait nearly as long for the remaing seasons to be released. BTW, I noticed some of the music within episodes was changed. Perhaps there were copyright issues that caused the delay? At any rate, let's hope they move more quickly to release Seasons 4, 5, and 6!!!"
5,Finally...,I am so glad that season 3 has finally been released. I hope they don't take too long to release the following seasons...
5,Whooha!!,Finally Season 3 is here! Please! Please! Please everyone buy! buy! buy! so we can get Season 4 soon. Christmas would be great :-)
5,It just gets better and better!,"Season 3 of The Nanny really begins to pick up momentum for the audience. Each episode is laced with such incredible wit, charm, sarcasm, and non stop wisecracks between Niles the butler and C.C. Babcock! Stand out episodes are ""The Kibbutz"", ""The Unkindest Gift"", ""The Grandma's"", and ""Ship of Frans"". I am truly amazed at Fran Drescher's comical timing....it is simply a rarity in television today. I can not wait for season 4 to arrive on DVD! Hilarious season!! 10 out 10."
5,"I'M DYING OF NANNY WITHDRAWALS, ALREADY!!!","COME ON, PEOPLE!! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE NANNY SEASON 3 FOR WAAAY TOO LONG, NOW... I AM GOING THROUGH NANNY AND NILES WITHDRAWALS... I NEED CEE-CEE AND HER DRY SENSE OF HUMOR.. IT BETTER HURRY UP AND BE RELEASED BEFORE I HAVE TO HURT SOMEONE... AND LET ME TELL YOU, IT WILL NOT BE PRETTY.. PLEASE!!!"
4,Funny Show; Terrible Packaging,"My review is not about the show, because I am a fan. My problem is with the company's packaging of the discs. The set comes with three discs, but each are stacked on top of one another. To me this was a cheap way to package delicate items. Possibly these discs could become damaged this way. All of my multi-packs have never looked this way. Saving money is fine, but do it in a more common sense factor. Customer satisfaction is highly important, and I don't feel that skimping on quality packaging to protect the goods is a good idea. If the discs become damaged from this, then sales may be lost from word of mouth. Use the appropiate amount of disc storage in the case, which makes sense to me."
4,I love the Nanny But Oh My God!!!!!,I can not believe what they have done with the packaging. It is awful that the disks are all stacked on top of each other instead of in cases. I really like this show but I don't know if I'm going to buy it if this is what it's going to look like.Besides it is now on Nick at Nite so I can watch it anytime. I already own season 1 and will get season 2 but I will have to think about getting or not.I would have given this a lower score but I love the show too much to do so. I doubt they will fix the packaging so I guess I will have to buy it this way because I love this show so much.
5,Review,I was surprised to find the entire season on one disc. Assumed it would have multiple discs. Product arrived quickly. Now if the additional seasons would become available...
5,Bravo!,"Many encores and gracious accolades to Sony for their decision to release Season 3 of the Nanny! After checking with the Amazon site almost every week since the Summer of 2008 and waiting so patiently, it was a grand, surreal surprise to see the prompt for the pre-order of this item! This series is truly one worth purchasing.It is an item that has been worth waiting for and especially for the faithful Nanny followers who have been hoping for this seasons and the others to be released on DVD! With the release of Season 3, there is a revitalized hope that the other seasons will soon materialize and appear for purchase. Being able to add Season 3 along with Seasons 1 and 2 has created a new excitement. I have really enjoyed watching these episodes and having loads of laughs while I literally ""kick-up-my-heels"" and relax. With the release of Season 3, having access to the complete collection doesn't look so bleak!"
4,Awesome show...but what's with the music and the case that it comes in?????,"Length:: 4:31 MinsHere's my video review for ""The Nanny"" Season Three on DVD. Enjoy!!!"
2,Review is for packaging !,"NOte: this review is for the CHEAP packaging. The discs were stacked on the spindle and there were NO episode synopses as in Seasons 1&2. With the Nanny now on Nick@Nite, I hope future seasons use the 1&2 packaging"
1,Not Being released,"I hate to burst everyone's bubble but i have heard the sony will not be releasing any more nanny seasons. I guess they have a habit of doing this when a movie is not as big of a hit as they would want it. I thnk it sucks and it really makes me mad. I love the nanny and really wish that they would just release the other seasons and get it over with. Sorry everyone. I did also hear the if everyone who is a fan writes to sony and tells them that we want the nanny released they may do that, but i don't know. I think that they have their mind made up and won't budge. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but i hope this helps."
2,Packaging Stinks,"I bought this DVD for my wife for Mother's Day. She loves the show. When she opening it this morning, all three discs were stacked on top of each other. No separation. I ended up having to find 2 more DVD cases so that Discs 2 and 3 wouldn't get scratched up to high heavens. For the list price, you think that they could have splurged on a little better packaging.Again, this review is for the packaging, not the show itself."
5,"the Nanny, perfection in humor and a love for a true NYer","EVERY ONE WHO'S BEEN HOLDING THEIR BREATH WAITING FOR SONY TO GET OFF THEIR BUTTS AND RELEASE SEASON THREE OFTHE NANNY WILL BE ELATED THAT IT HAS COME TO PASS!THE CONTINUATION OF MISS FINE AND MR. SHEFIELD GETTINGCLOSER TO ONE ANOTHER WHILE GRANDMA YETTA MAKING MOREAPPEARANCES MAKES THIS SEASON ANOTHER DISC YOU CAN'TPASS UP IN OWNING FOR YOURSELF.LET'S HOPE SONY RELEASES THE REST OF THE NANNY, SEASONBY SEASON BEFORE WE ALL GROW OLD AND DIE!"
4,Sarcastic and sassy,"This isn't the best sit-com, and it certainly doesn't have the best acting, but it is hilarious. The show is overflowing with sarcasm and irreverence. Fran Drescher is great as a nanny who doesn't respect boundaries - both personal and comedic. I love how Niles personifies the sarcastic butler. The kids are adorable, especially Grace, who talks back with an attitude. Every once in a while when I watch ""The Nanny"" I find myself bursting with laughter.Unfortunately, the show didn't get much attention when it was on. Some of its cultural references are outdated (frequent references to the Clintons and Dolly Parton). However, if you didn't catch it while it was being aired, these DVDs are definitely worth checking out."
1,Dissatisfaction,I was very disappointed in The Nanny - The Complete Third Season because of its packaging. All of the discs were stacked right on top of one another without anything in between to protect the discs. Mine was damaged and I had to send it back. I opted to not buy another set because of the way it was packaged. I was sorely disappointed after having enjoyed The Nanny seasons 1 and 2 through Amazon.
5,WooHoo,I love this show and i'm super excited to get the third season. I hope to own all the seasons some day. Can't wait!!
3,"Great show, bad packaging.","After months of saving money, I bought a 32"" LCD TV along with Seasons 1,2, and 3 of The Nanny and season 1 of Zoey 101. When I got the shows I opened up season one and two and was very pleased, but then I opened up season 3 and found out that the DVD's were all just stacked on top of one another. That makes it even easier to get scratches! If you like the show then you should buy this, but if you are very particular on the packaging this is not for you.-treyrg"
5,MY FAVORITE SHOW!,"I LOVE Fran Drescher, I LOVE The Nanny. I own and have watched Season 1 and 2 about 1,000 times!! So looking forward to watching Season 3... FINALLY RELEASED! THIS IS THE ONLY SHOW THAT I OWN & HAVE REPEATEDLY WATCHED FOR YEARS!! Hurry up and release the remainder of the series!"
5,Love The Nanny!,I loved the nanny when i was a teen! Now i have it at home to watch when ever i need a laugh! Great price and delivery time was awsome!
5,Can't wait for the year 2050 when the show will finally be released on BLU-RAY (Season 1),"Everyone here at home love's the show! But why does it takes a billion years before the next season is released? Anyway, I guess we can't complain now... we finally got our third season. Can't wait for the day I retire when season four will be released!The packaging is unlike any box set I've seen... the discs are just stacked on top of each other!!! Horrible packaging with other words.Bottom line, we are very happy season three finally came out!!! If you love the show, it's a must.... but you better buy it before they change their mind and the word UNAVAILABLE appears again.GGGGG are we optimistic today :o)"
5,WHY ARE WE WAITING!!!!!!!!!!!,"It seems that all the great innocent family shows like ""The Nanny"" and ""The Cosby Show"" are so slow in being released. Why is it that shows like ""Friends"" gets released all at the same time. Are the television companies worried that we might actually stop watching current TV and watch DVD's instead? My family loves The Nanny and it is painful having to wait everytime we finish a season, even if we watch one a day.....or one a week."
4,So glad it's here/ poor packaging,"I was thrilled to pre-order season 3 of The Nanny on DVD. I thought this was going to be another one of those unfinished series on DVD. I'm very excited to have it, but I'm not impressed with the packaging. A standard DVD case that holds all three discs on one spindle. One thing manufacturers tell you not to do is stack CDs and DVDs on top of one another because they scratch very easily. Yet this is how Sony packaged them. I thought the slim case packaging worked just fine. Oh well. Here's hoping for season 4 before 3 years go by."
5,ott light replacement,By accident I broke the lamp in my wifes' magnafying lens. I bought this replacement and it worked great. What else can I say except boy was she pissed when I broke the first one.
5,One of the best toys for adults as well as kids,"Simon is an excellent tool for improving memory. It stimulates the mind and provides great satisfaction along the way. The handheld version is compact and can easily be carried around in your pocket. I absolutely love it and whenever I am a little down, I play with it and immediately forget my troubles. I recommend this to all kids and especially to adults who are having trouble remembering."
4,Addicting toy,"I like the simon hand held because you start following the pattern to a stopping point when you lose. Then you are frusterated and are determined to do it again. Even if you beat Simon it is still calling you to play again. It is very addicting hand held. I go to O.T. and my theripist introduced me to Simon and I started playing it and I spent 30 minutes trying to beat Simon. I did beat him once and I beat him again right when I was about to leave. I still can't beat it again. My theripist tryed to do it and wasn't even close. She spent 10 minutes figuring it out. She didn't get after 10 minutes and gave up. So if you decide to make more Simon hand helds, for your sake in money you might want to make it more difficult so it will be even more addicting."
3,Great little stocking stuffer!,Sure brings back memories of the regular game size from when we were kids! Perfect size for a car toy for our sons! Light weight and feels like it may not be terribly durable but it has survived two busy boys very well! Our 5 y.o. is really enjoying getting the hang of it!
3,Too noisy!,"I bought this toy to keep my kids entertained in the car on long trips. But it does not give you the option of turning off the sound. It would be enough for the kids to just follow the light pattern, but it doesn't give you that choice. So now I don't allow them to play it anywhere near me....especially not in the car!"
2,The pages are upside down and cut off?!,"I received this book and for some odd reason, the seller sold a copy that was printed upside down and most of the top page was cropped off. It made it annoying to read. The advice in the book is pretty sound, but I didn't like the format and by today's standards the fashions are dated, of course. I really like books about fashion but this one bored me."
2,"Not really a ""style"" book","This book is good for explaining which shapes of clothes look good on which figures, how clothes should fit, and how to tie a scarf. While that is helpful, I was expecting to learn some ""secrets of style"" as the title claims. Some tips on finding a style that corresponds with your personality or lifestyle, how to make it your own, shop for it, and keep it updated...that's what I thought I was buying. Too bad."
3,"i just finishing reading the book, good points but not enough","i like this book bcuz has the don'ts of clothing by shape, it helped me allot since i am a petite woman, however it lefttt sooo muchhhh out of the picture, was more like the title was soo wronngggg, the should rename it to : what it suits u best ""the Do & the Don'ts"" i tought i 'll find a quiz asking my activities or what i like to define My style!!!! or at least pictures of wannabe style: like ppl who borrow style from Jackie O, Portman, Princess Grace Kelly, Letizia Ortiz, Princess Rania, Etc, like really a book to help u research u'r personal unique style And put it to work for u. but still ok to buy I guess, but not creative mind blowing,... Sorry, this is more like do's and don't list."
2,Horrible,"The only reason I gave it two stars and not one is because the delivery was fast. The description saw it was collectible new. When I received it, the puzzle box was not as it was described. The corners were not good, the was tape marks on the side of the box, and worse of all, the was a lot of hair balls in the puzzle! Disgusting!!! Even though the delivery service is good, the product are nasty."
5,You don't have to be a fan!,A wonderfully written and absolutely entertaining book. No other series of books is closer to the characters than those of Lee Goldberg. I couldn't stop reading until I was finished ... reading it in trains and buses and any other place it took me only 20 hours. Buy it NOW!!!
3,Did the Job,...but I definitely had my problems when applying. Seeming you are only using a certain portion at a time its hard to get the full amount on the application brush at once. It did dye my lashes but when I tried to get more towards my eye lids it burnt and when I closed my eyes the product got in my eyes and severely burnt my eyes as well.The product did what it was purchased for but as that saying goes. With beauty comes pain. With this product that is so true.
4,"Edgy, Angular Austin Pop","One of the most creative bands in alternative rock, Glass Eye both defines and defies the genre. With co-leaders who have radically different sensibilities, this Austin band is sometimes very edgy, sometimes quite melodic, and usually sounds like no one else. - Bruce Eder, All Music GuideVery edgy, angular pop. Deconstructed? Visionary! - Robert Gordon, All Music Guide"
3,Average at Best,"I recently downloaded this from Amazon and I am less than impressed. The songs are far from engaging and the music is bland and too soft. Honestly, most of the songs are quite uninteresting for me and my 16 month old son. Italian is a musical language, there is just no excuse for this not being a much better CD. All in all, I like it better than ""Teach Me... Italian"", but it is not in the same ballpark as ""Baby's First Words in Italian."" My son has listened to Baby's First over and over again, but this CD bores him. Overall, I'd recommend passing on this."
2,Italian music CD for kids,I ordered this CD b/c of the great reviews it got. Neither my 2 1/2 year old or I like it. The singing is ok but what really makes it annoying and boring is the loud and somewhat high pitched instruments that accompanies every song. Definitely I waste of money for me and cannot recommend it at all!!!
4,fun CD,"This is a great CD for those who are trying to teach their children another language (Italian) or for those who are native speakers. It has fun songs like ABC's in Italian, etc. My daughter really likes it."
5,canzoni Per Bambini Volume I,Both of my grandchildren love this CD. It is played often as it is requested by both.
3,Good vaue,Could have had more body to each piece. Way to thin. Colors are really good. Grand daughter likes to play with them.
5,Great product!,Absolutely love the bible stories for the flannel board. It's the best educational tool to start with the young kids. They are sponges and the graphics are great. Love this product.
5,No Limit is Back,"Well I have every No Limit CD ever put out. I have to say this CD really brings back the old sound at times. No Limit will never be No Limit with out Beats by the Pound, KLC or Mo. B Dick. But this new cat laying down the beats knows what's going on and must be a fan of the old No Limit because he does a hell of a job to bring back the old sound. I'l so glad it's getting back on track for P. It will never be like 97-99 but it's getting pretty damn close. This CD is tight, every song is good and the one with C is great. The whole CD hits hard so this one is for any NO LIMIT SOLDIER out there. Go cop it! Ya Heard Me. FREE C!"
3,the no limit boyz are back,"overall this a good cd. Master p is cotinuing where he left off in 2004 bringing the hits back and doing it independently. where u from is hard, go off is, a banger and a cut from c-murder stressin. brings the tru soldiers back to life. master p has also enlisted new soldiers halleluyah and hall and has a cut with afficial currensy should've been on the album though but look out for his group the rich boyz. also the songs drama, shake it, and sea saw for me make some good club songs. This a good piece to add to the new no limit coolection it especially brings further shine to help c-murder promote his album which drops in march 05 the truest i ever said. Silk the shocker could've had more appearances on this but it is overall a good cd big ups to the new no limit"
2,Its Da Principle,"I dont giva f#$^. Without C-Murda dis jus sound like P, Silkk, and some new dude rappin on outdated beats. Wait a minute. Thats exactly what this is. If they couldnt get C they just should have waited. This is not TRU. Everyone has been waitin on a TRU disc since 99, but we could have waited longer if we knew P would freak out and drop this weak $h*!. Whats wrong with this guy."
3,"Ok, not a bad cd","Average cd, all in all, photo book and stressin are tight songs and I feel c murders new cd will be hot, Im glad to see no limit back in the game.Flit"
