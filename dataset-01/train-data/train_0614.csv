3,GE A830 8MP Digital Camera is OK,"The camera is OK, good value for the money. Construction is a bit on the cheap side but it keeps it light. The only thing that's a drawback for me is the fact that it uses 2 AA batteries which weigh down the camera & you need to carry a 12 pack of them with you if you're out for a night of photos as the flash consumes them very quickly. When you carry the rechargeable, you're then stuck carrying the dead one's around with you all night which is truly a pain in the butt! If they could just put in a long lasting rechargeable batter - this would be five stars for the value."
2,All around cheap,"I bought this camera about 3 months ago. The whole time I have had it, I've been frustrated with the quality of the picture. It has some great features on it for sure, but the optics are horrible. I can't take any shot indoors without a flash, no matter what time of day it is, and how sunny the room is. I think the problem is that it doesn't get to a wide enough aperture (especially zoomed in). I tried manually setting the ISO to 400, but it didn't help, and the pictures came out noisier than Hillary Clinton.Bottom Line, if I wanted another cheap camera, I would go with maybe a 5MP camera made by Canon or HP. I think that I would find that the pictures would actually come out better. (not an overstatement)"
5,"A Lesson in ""Lost History""","John Mulhall's book is an excellent historical review of history as we may not have known it. With excellent documentation and quotes from people who had major influence in the events that have shaped our present-day situation, we are presented with American politics that have long escaped attention and public scrutiny. Sometimes the chronology is difficult to follow, probably because of the sheer volume of information he presents. The bibliography is excellent and tempts further readings into our so misunderstood dealings in the Middle East."
4,His best CD in many years,"A couple of things I particularly like about this fine recording. Hassell uses, here, a trumpet sound that falls somewhere on the continuum between the highly processed voice we remember from Fourth World Vol 1 and the straighter sound he employed on Fascinoma. This time it's recognizable both as Jon Hassell AND as a trumpet. The other real jewel here is terrific bass playing. Highly recommended CD."
3,Misrepresented,"Although billed as a ""Kitchen Towel Combo"" the packaging labels the product ""Tailgate Towels."" Rather than a set of two towels of the same size, it was a regular sized towel and a ""finger towel."" Not at all what I was expecting. This is clearly a misrepresentation."
2,Outrageous price!,"I read these books 20 years ago, and I really enjoyed them. I would like to read them again, but the prices are ridiculous! I understand the publisher set the prices, but seriously, what do they think they have here? $20 for an e-book? Get real!"
1,$20??!?,yea...im sure this book is really good but i got a kindle so i wouldnt have to pay $20 for a book. i really enjoyed the last one but until this book comes down to a reasonable price i wont be buying it
4,A strong sequel with even more depth,"A series which continues to get better. The author's use of descriptive language is exceptional, and chances are that you'll run across several words you've never seen before, even those with large vocabularies. The dialog is quite fine, too, but the narrative voice is where the author really shines. The only issue I have with the narrative voice is that it still gives annoying ""little did they know how wrong their assumptions would be"" kind of giveaways. I understand what the author's trying to do, but it ruins the immediacy of the story. Still, a fantastic, entertaining read. I'm a little concerned at some of the prices put out for single copies of the book ($27.00 for a new paperback copy?), but such are the throes of the publishing industry."
3,Warning!,"While there is considerable talent in the people who do the reading in these classics, be advised that these books are ABRIDGED, and have large sections completely omitted."
1,This guy is a tool,"So far after reading the first 2 chapters, I have realized that Harry Beckwith is a blowhard. Nothing that the author talks about has helped me in my relationships with my customers. I would have been better off reading one of my children's books to myself in the mirror. This guys is a tool of the first order. I should have realized that after I saw the jacket cover. Regurgitated customer service principles from the upteenth person is irritating to say the least. Madison, this is your fault."
1,"Unsubstantiated, street smart'(!) and useless advice","...Because the guy downplays the role of scientific research in developing arguments and concepts, his arguments are based only on selective circumstantial evidence. Hence, you are not sure whether to take them seriously or not so seriously. But thank goodness they are so rudimentary that you don't have to go through such a questioning process. If you are selling pans and pots door-to-door, you may find some good advice in the book. If you are looking for something more on conceptual and intellectual levels with hard evidence, don't bother. Look elsewhere."
2,Too clever for his own good,"Over the years, the author has gained some real business wisdom he's willing to share, but the amount of wading through self-invented catchphrases, inscrutable organization and bad writing you have to do to get to it makes it almost not worth the trouble.Reading this book, it's almost sounds as if this guy wrote this book mostly for the purpose of sounding clever, at the expense of content and practical advice. Unfortunately for the reader, the book tends to give the impression that this guy's primary talent lies in flattering the very rich or soon to be rich rather than actually helping people grow their business."
3,some benefit,"Although I certainly have not noticed any weight loss with this product, my stomach is the flattest it has been in years."
2,safflower oil,I did not not note any significant change. No weight loss.My blood work showed no significant difference than before I completed taking the bottle of safflower..
1,Used for abortions?,"I purchased this item because an article by Dr. Oz said that taking the Safflower Oil, from the SEEDS, would take inches off my waist.In the first week, I began spotting heavily. I looked the oil up, and found that side effects would include possible spotting, and that safflower oil is taken for use in abortions. WHAT? I refuse to take anymore pills."
1,Disappointed,I was told taking safflower oil everyday would help with belly fat so I decided to purchase the softgels to make it easier the problem is these softgels are so darn big I have a hard time swallowing them so I can't take them. Not recommended.
2,Lori,Can't review it as we have not received the product yet. It has been back ordered. We are hoping to try the product soon.
5,THERE HE IS!!!!!!!!,A book the length that would normally take me about 2 weeks to read only took me less than 3 days! Just how things were worded and unexpected made my imagination think about it and kept me laughing! And I don't think I'll be very afraid of scary stories or anything anymore since I've never really paid attention to the patterns named in Go Ask Mom! I did not want to put this book down when I got it and I didn't really have to. But it wasn't one of those harder to read books. I would recommend this book to other people.
5,Ella IHE,"This book is a fabulous book. The best upper bunk stories. Gabriel has a lazy eye, one leg shorter than the other and his hair looks like a ferret stapled to his head. Gabriel gets bullied by his brother Carl. Gabriel has an older brother that bosses Gabriel around. Gabriel spies on his brother because Carl's friend sees there is a dead dog in a river."
3,it works,"this is a very light weight product. don't expect anthing great, it does the job at a very low cost."
5,Stanley 1050 Garage Door Remote,I was very pleased to find that Amazon could obtain this remote for me. I got 2 (one for me and one for my husband) to replace the old ones that had broken. They came with easy instructions to program. Easy because I did have an old one from which I could copy. We are very satisfied. Thanks so much !!
5,Stanley 1050 Garage Door Opener,The product arrived on time. It worked just as intented and was at a reasonable price. If you need a Stanley garage door opener this is the place to buy one.
3,Average,"These never last very long, but they do the job. I'd be willing to pay more for something that was a little sturdier."
5,Garage Door Opener,"The company was awesome. They even shipped it to Canada in the time predicted. Also a personalized note was attached, very nice touch. I would definitely shop with them again."
4,Stanley 1050 Garage Door remote transmitter,"The transmitters work as advertised, directions to set them up are clear and easy. The shipping charge ($14.13) from Open Door Enterprises LLC for the three of them is definitely on the high side but these are hard to find since the garage door opener is so old. So the total is still a lot less than a new garage door opener not to mention the ""hassle factor"" of replacing everything.All of the transmitters work fine and they were delivered as promised."
1,Very Poor Design,The button will not stay seated properly in its place. I bought two and it happened to both. Once this happens they will not work normally ever again. And do not drop it or it's toast.
3,Stanley Remote,"Factory original replacement. Works like all the original, but a cheap remote. They last about a year, then break."
4,Great Replacement,"I needed a new remote since the one we inherited with our new house turned out to be a dud (would work when it wanted to; we could tell it was very old). I was thrilled when I found this one online and even moreso when I saw the price. As soon as it arrived, I programmed it and it worked so easily. This may not be the prettiest, but it does what it's made to do. I did deduct one star because it does feel kind of ""cheap"", like it could break very easily."
5,Perfect replacement remote,My remote had a piece break on the inside and I found this replacement here on Amazon to be of perfect quality and inexpensive price. Was easy to put together.
4,garage door opener,"After several years, the old one broke. Good to see still have these things available. Works fine. Inserting battery is a bit difficult."
2,Visor Remote,"I wanted the ""visor"" style like in the photo. Instead I received a small keychain style. It works good - but not what I expected."
3,it didn't work,"I purchased the Stanley garage door opener remote because of the testimonials that stated that the remote would work with old garage door openers. It did not work on mine. Additionally, when I expressed a wish to return the remote, the cost of mailing and re-shelving the product exceeded the cost of the product, essentially leaving me with a useless piece of plastic. I appealed for my money back, but the company would only offer me credit for another item purchased from them. A poor consumer experience left me wondering about fairness."
1,know your return policy,"purchased this at the recommendation of the manufacturer and this remote does not work with the type of door opener unit I have (you would think Stanley would know their products!) so I am now out $14 unless I want to spend another $8 to return the remote to the seller which would cost me a total of $22 for something I can not use and return. I should have 'paid' closer attention to the return policy before making such a purchase. A word of caution if your garage door opener was made prior to 2000 then you MUST purchase the exact same remote to replace a defective one as the technology has changed and there is no such thing as a ""universal remote""....BUYER BEWARE"
2,stanley remote,"It's a bargain, but the button eventually gets stuck and then does not work. The old original had a metal tab that could be pushed after the button broke. Now the with the ""advanced"" technology, when the button fails, you're screwed. Like another review said, it works for about a year and then breaks."
2,Broke quickly,"I actually bought two of these remotes, one for myself and one for my roommate and they worked fine at first but after about a year both broke within the same month. The button on the case snapped off. I continued to use the tiny button bare circuit board for a few weeks but then that stopped working as well."
5,Remote Garage door opener,It works and it was easy to install. I was glad our old opener was around (broken) therefore I was able to copy the setting.
5,exact replica,"When I needed to replace two aging openers, I found these. They arrived quickly and, lo and behold!, were EXACTLY like the ones I was replacing. Perfect purchase and an extremely reasonable price."
5,Open Sesame,I set the code and it worked first shot and continues to work flawlessly. What more do you need from a garage door opener?
1,Stanley should be ashamed to put their name on this!,"I have used this model remote for over 15 years, only because the dealer here only carried this model. It is junk. They are poorly designed so that they break really easily. Even pushing the button too hard can break the unit. I have a bag currently of at least 6 of these, in various stages of breakage, that I will now throw away. About a year ago I discovered the little white mini that Stanley has, and it is a dream to use. Don't waste your money on the 1050."
1,door opener,sorry very diappointed in this item it's suppose to replace my old one couldn't set the code in it so it don't work
4,GREAT DEAL,"exact duplicate of the original, priced lower than the universal model and was shipped earlier than expected. definitely would recommend this to anyone."
2,In a pinch,"Only use this remote if you have too. Had three of them now, two originals and one replacement The plastic nipples that hold the button plate and hold the case together always break right away. They still work but you have to tape things together and several times you have to take the case apart and adjust the button plate placement so it will work."
4,HOA Needs,"Just what the HOA ordered.Great price - shipping cost is high.With each new homeowner in the neighborhood you need two.When the shipping cost, of an item weighing nothing, is higher than the cost of the item - shop around."
5,Excellent!,"I really needed a remote transmitter for our old garage door. I was so impressed with the price and the fact that it was compatible. With a few adjustments, this worked fine. This was also sent in super speedy time. Thank you!"
2,Crumbly and flavor weak,"I didn't like this one - it has a resistant mouth feel, but within 10 chews, it's in a hundred pieces. Although Canadian, who usually do eatable things better than their neighbors SOB, I thought the flavor was much like the popular(why?) American licorice twists, which I consider very weak - if you like those, you may like these too."
2,flimsy flag,"Flag colors and coat of arms are correct but this flag is VERY flimsy. Printed on the thinnest, most translucent fabric I have ever seen used for anything besides ladies' tights. If you are in for a see-through flag, go ahead. But you better not fly it in bright sunshine - on in inclement weather, that is. You may use this as an indoor flag, pinned to a wall. For all other uses, or to actually fly it, I do not recommend."
4,bavarian flag,"For the price the flag was a good buy. It was only $5 so you cant expect a professional tough durable flag, but for what i am using it for it is perfect. Product came quickly with no hassles."
2,"Good if you like the scorpions, but not if you like HiFi","Good blend of old and new from the time. Production is pretty bad, even considering this is a live recording. Not athmospheric, just annoying. Still, I would recommend this to any Scorpion fans as a suitable accompaniment to the Tokyo Tapes."
3,"NOT THE BEST, BUT....","I think Scorpions are much lot better than what this Cd shows, its the latest album I've bought so far and its the one that I listen less. I believe Live Bites is much lot better than this one, It has muc more power and it sounds really great.I believe the public is too loud on WWL album and the guitars so low that you cant go crazy with some songs...Thee first song, Coming Home, is one that I love but here, you feel the public is exploting and when the song starts, you have to pay a lot of atention to realize that until the drums enter...I think also that Klaus voice is much better in the Live Bites.I know...this album is from 1985, Live Bites is from 1995 10 YEARS OF PROGRESS, but Blackout and Love At First Sting are as good as 90' albums and WWL, could have really been much more. I expected a lot better than this.Any way it is a Scorpions album and if you are a fan like me, you should have it. I am only saying what I think is true."
1,Almost Sucks!,"This CD doesn't show even a quarter of the talent the Scorps had. Even though ""Loving You Sunday Morning"" is a great song, all the others are trash compared to the Uli-era's songs, like ""Pictured Life"", ""Polar Nights"", ""Dark Lady"", ""Fly To The Rainbow"" or ""Robot Man"". Matthias Jabs simply ruined the band, together with Rudolf Schenker's will to gain more and more money with the band. I recommend their first live album, ""Tokyo Tapes"", from 1978. That's much better than WWL."
2,Compilation that doesn't fit,"This live album is perfect to have, in only one CD, the best of Scorpions in his era pos-Ulrich Roth. The trouble is: the era pos-Ulrich Roth is not good."
5,A bit of history,"Hey, it isn't perfect but these guys probably had a lot of nights like this. The sound is good. The songs are great. And despite what a lot of folks are saying the performances are inspired.I bought this on itunes for $5.96. Get it now for that price."
1,i think this is just a cover with blank or lined pages?,"I could be wrong but I am under the impression that this is a journal for writing in, and merely features Krazy Kat on the cover. The featured review applies to a different item, the anthology featuring an introduction by e e cummings. that one is not this one. I think.I don't really know how I'd rate this item. I put a 1 star just to alert people."
3,Time for A New Biography,"This book was written in 1977, when typically, star biographies were neither particularly honest nor too personal. This is a gushing tribute to DK's supposed unspoilt and unpretentious behaviour and does a good biblographic job of her film career. There is an interesting summary of her early years and the apparently effortless break into stardom, but it doesn't address any personal issues or obstacles. For example she apparently told Noel Coward in 1959 that she was fighting for custody of her children and then there are the rumoured affairs with two co-stars. It would be interesting to hear of her life since 1977, particularly with regard to her battle with Parkinson's Disease. She's still alive, which is certainly worth celebrating."
3,Amateur Author,"What's wrong with this read, is that Braun is not a good writer. The opening chapters are really poor writing....disjointed....no ""voice"" that pulls you into the book. There is too much uninteresting detail about some family members....not interesting. Afterall, this is a bio of a great actress. The reader wants to know more about HER. I found it interesting that someone who was, in the beginning described as ""plump"" would within 5-6 years become and English sensation and on to Hollywood. There were the comments that her ""eyes"" and that ""the camera loved her"" surely pointed Kerr toward stardom, but there is an inner knowledge of Kerr the PERSON that I found missing."
3,Food for imagination,"This is just a ""medium""-sized Lego structure, and it still takes hours to build! Once done, it's fun. My son and I enjoy riffing on the giant squid (with the diver skeleton in its belly) and the various facial expressions on the other, ""living"" personnel. We have already rebuilt it once. He is careful with his toys, but Lego works are especially subject to the effects of entropy."
4,Get this album if you don't have any Billy Ray Cyrus,"If you want some really good Billy Ray songs, buy this as it is all you will ever need from him. It includes some of his best known hits including his blockbuster ""Achy Breaky Heart"" which is probably my least favorite. But the rest of it shows Billy can sing something other than a novelty song."
2,Not much for your money,"I bought this book and was very disappointed. There are relatively few projects and the instructions are not that well illustrated and it is very costly for the number of pages. I took a course in Peyote Stitch and the instructor used the Well's book. I would therefore instead recommend the Carol Wilcox Books (both of them). The first (Creative Bead Weaving) has fantastic instructions for all types of peyote and the 2nd (The Art and Elegance of Beadweaving), has the most beautiful projects imaginable. In addition both books cover many other forms of beadweaving. They are about twice as big and cost less and are truly inspiring."
4,Beading with Peyote Stitch,A comprehensive review of the various types of peyote stitch. Clear instructions and diagrams. Great for a beginner and a good reference for the advanced beader. Has a number of pages of finished products without instructions which may or may not be useful.
2,Works great until,you put it in the water. Worked for about 30 seconds after that. Water gets into the battery compartment fairly easily. Save your money on this one.
1,Absolutely Useless,"Don't waste a penny on this book. It has only arcane & common sense information & tends to focus more on finding promos & rewards benefits for high end resorts & vacations. This is not cheap or next to nothing.If you want to travel cheaply, pack light with essentials that will keep your cost down(a carry on bag small enough to be considered a personal item), look for cheap airfares / other tickets to nowhere in particular (EG. You don't care where you go & are only doing it because the tickets are cheap) through sites like airfarewatchdog.com & stay in hostels, cheap motels or couch surfing either with friends or if you are comfortable with it through Couch Surfing dot comThere, fixed. No need to buy this crap book."
5,Spectacular,"The song titled `Together We Are One', in my opinion, is the true definition of just how wonderful music can get. It has a great tune, message, and is overall very easy on the ears. I first heard this song when Delta performed it on the Commonwealth games 2006 held in Australia and I have to admit that I have been addicted to it since. It is truly an astonishing song, written by Delta herself along with boyfriend Brian McFadden, and should not be missed out by anyone (especially those who are already Delta fans). Not only does it have a great melody, but Delta greatly shows her vocal range throughout the entire song. Again, if you don't believe my word, give the CD a go and enjoy the true beauties of music. In addition to the new single, the other songs on the CD are also very enjoyable and highly recommended."
4,Bhutan VHS Review,Concentrated too much on animals and birds and not enough on the peoples' cultural history.I was charged $ 43.93 when it can be ordered from PBS for$ 19.98.Richard
1,The Missing Eden,"Having spent time in Bhutan, I was nonplussed that this video failed to focus on the people and rich culture of Bhutan. None of what I experienced in Bhutan was even mentioned in this uninsightful video. I feel this video is very misleading, lacking in depth and would not prepare a prospective traveler for a visit. The people, culture, architecture, dzongs, enlightened monarchy, building of roads, the relationship of the country to China and India -- these are just a few of the topics not covered in the video. The video was worse than a waste of time and money: it was a poor show. PBS should be ashamed to have their name associated with such a shoddy product."
2,"Quick grower, plant sap (milk) nerve irritant!","Stay away from the sap! Does produce quite a bit of milky white sap when broken or cut! Wound up in the hospital with extreme eye irritation! Some get anaphylactic shock shock from it! Wash your hands well after touching!Otherwise, this plant grows quickly and propagates easily by breaking off a piece and sticking it in the ground."
5,Perfect add-on to my trip,I took the book with me to London a few weeks ago. Made a note of every little local pub I found as well as tidbits of information that will prove useful next time I'm in town. It's just so much more manageable than a clunky old tour book half of the items you never use.
3,Recommended if you don't demand perfect quality,The sound is okay on this disc but the picture quality doesn't even come close to the quality of the key videos. Some scenes are a little too dark while others are a little too bright and others look kind of fuzzy. But the picture problems aren't so bad that it makes the disc unwatchable. So if you really want these movies on DVD and don't mind quality that only ranks as acceptable then buy it. But pass on it if you're looking for something with good quality.
3,Performance matching.,The CH Throttle Quadrant 300-133 is very good in software matching. The Working in Windows 2000 and XP has gone well. The thing in this unit to work on is the through gradiant in control during landings. The need for more gradient to through ratio is necessary for matching flight control throttle during landings. It is better to use auto throttle and switch this one on during landings and taxi and takeoffs. The buttons tab set of 12 at front of unit need to be spread out and labeled to make them effective and more usable. Hitting one during play is possible and can trigger and option not wanted at that moment.
4,Nice device,"Bought the Quadrant/Yoke/Pro pedal combo and am pleased with the quality and performance of the Yoke and Quadrant. Im using the default settings for both and had to go to ""ch hanger"" (their forum) to find out what controls/buttons did what as the boxes had no instructions!Cant comment on the pro pedals as I have not used them yet but suspect they may be overkill for my purposes.Perhaps they are more suitable for the joystick? Good luck programming both units if you dont want to use the defaults... it just seemed to be too much of a pain.All in all they are worth the money."
5,Suspends Unbelievability,An essential to the serious simmer for multi engine A/C! Quality and ease of installation is tops! CH Products has done GOOD!
3,configuration troubles,"Not such a good adquisition, i own the ch pro pedals and the ch flight yoke and both are great, the thing is that since i bought the quadrant my flight sim has gone mad, it never saves the settings for trims, buttons or axes, no response has been received from the ch tech support department and the ch configuration manager software only got my troubles worst."
3,software,"I have had the CH throttle quadrant, the CH flight pedals, and the CH yoke and they make a great cockpit for flight MS Flight sim. and other war bird sims, but the throttle quadrant has a few issues. i love its many switches that i customize through in game options, but the software it came with sucks. every time i reboot my 2008 Toshiba laptop (which is built for this stuff) the CH control manager is not responsive and shuts off. This would bother me, but i don't really care much for out-of-game programming but this is something one must know before buying this product. I haven't found out how to enable reverse thrust or switch the colors around even with my little time on the software. maybe it is just my gaming laptop of 2008 but it did not work out so great for me. i recommend it, only on the basis that i don't care about the software. If your serious, get it, its the best on the market."
5,Throttle Quadrant,"I ordered this item and it has been all I expected it to be. The service is outstanding. I was told I would get it a certain day and giving a tracking number. I didn't really have time to keep up with where it was because it came 2 days ahead of time.Everything, product, service, price great, so good in fact that today I received another product from you that I ordered and it too came 3 days ahead of the time I was suppose to get it. Voice Buddy and headphones. Keep up the good work.Don"
3,Not the same as the 12' Powerlock,"I was really hoping that it would be the same form factor as the 12' only PowerLock tape, but it is smaller. The tape is smaller (width wise) too, and just doesn't have the heft. I suppose it does its job, but doesn't have that familiar feel."
2,Wrong size !!!!!!,"When I order the Drainer tray, I put in a search for a LARGE drainer tray. I assumed it was the LARGE tray but when I received it, it was the small tray. Very disappointed."
2,DISH DRAINER TRAY,"THE DISH DRAINER TRAY AS TOO SMALL I HAD TO SEND IT BACK, AND IT WAS REALLY TO THIN, FOR WHAT I WANTED IF IT HAD OF FIT. GOT GOOD SERVICE , AND THE RESEND BACK WAS EASY. I APPRECIATE THAT."
3,When men and women switch roles,"A definite oddity of a book that explores how and why men and women are infinitely different. One woman grows fully functional male genitalia and conversely a male is disfigured with female genitals in the back of his knee. What's most interesting about the books is the emotional metamorphosis, not necessarily the physical one that these two independent people experience.I liked the idea of the book, however I found the vocabulary to be grandiloquent at times. Reading this book with a dictionary nearby was a necessity for me. This isn't necessarily a weakness, however I found that the book should have been a little more decipherable for being such a small novelette. The story itself was grand; the vocabulary just confused and overshadowed the narrative. I liked the book, and I recommend it, just be prepared to sit with a dictionary while reading."
2,It was remaindered for good reason,"In this book, Will Self explores gender. Unfortunately, he doesn't really commit. In the first book, a bored suburban woman develops a penis. She doesn't develop a true, honest to God, do-I-dress-left-or-right one, just a nub. There just is not a lot driving her, either. She just seemed like a sad little person, who never goes anywhere. In the companion story, a macho man develops a vagina on his leg. To use the AOL-type acronym, WTF? Why not commit? Why not put it where they generally are located? You certainly won't find one on someone's leg!Both stories were too weak. He doesn't wake them up completely switched in gender, he does not really show how society treats men and women through the fresh eyes of someone who has undergone a full transformation. He just makes these oddball half-baked chimeras and has all of the consequence of the mutation be a result of their own internal ruminations.Best ignore this one and enjoy his other, more entertaining books."
2,"Ooh, I'm scared.","There's this woman, right, and she grows a penis!! It's soooo rude! That Will's so naughty! And then there's this subtext about antisemitism and it's so, like, deep! Crikey, he's clever.Will Self wants to be Kafka. Or maybe he wishes Kafka had never been born then he could have got there first. Let's be thankful good old Franz did beat him to it, and with a lot more style to boot. And Brett Easton Ellis does that shocking nastiness thing a whole lot better, too."
2,little for a lot,"there was no indication on how many ounces this product was... for the amount the sprinkles cost, there should have been at least 2 times the amount!!!"
3,Don't last long,"These are great to use, as long as you use them right away. I used the orange and the pink jimmies, and the leftover pink ones, left in the original packaging, lost their color after a few weeks. They might to better if you save them in a different container."
2,complain the dvd I received.,"I do not like it, when I place the order, you do not say it is in Korean and when play it, there is no sound when people talk to each other.but do have the background music."
5,Greatest Movie EVER!!!,"This is truly the greatest movie ever! Ok, it's kind of cheezy in some places (Ben Hur's eyes in the galley scene) but hey, they couldn't talk, how else would they convey their emotion? Another thing one must keep in mind as he watches this movie, this was made in 1927, there are no special effects. Everything you see is real! The boats actually caught on fire, the people in the circus maximus is real even the circus itself is real. No computer animation. People died when they made this, a few died in the chariot race but most people died in the sea-battle. Compared to this, Gladiator ain't nothin'. This is truly a great movie! This is better than the Charlton Heston version. Of course the Charlton Heston version IS very good, it's more in-depth, if you watch this and have a few blank spots as to why some characters did what they did, consult the Charlton Heston verson. But this is truly a great movie!!"
5,"Beautiful, Refreshing, and very real",Jenny Bruce's debut album presents music written truly from the heart and soul. Jenny's rich vocals and enchanting melodies combined with deep lyrics make this ablum a joy to listen to
3,"Great films, fair DVD","The rating is for DVD quality not for the films. Both of them are 4 stars films. But DVD quality is not as satisfactory. 2 stars for ""Love Affair"" and 3 stars for ""Penny Serenade""The price is great with two great films on one DVD. However,I wished the quality of DVD could have been a little better especially on ""Love Affair"" This is probably the best video available now but the DVD quality is still under my expectation."
2,Terrible transfer,"I love Irene Dunn. I long to see I Remember Mamma and some of her other wonderful films, but this transer to DVD stinks."
3,Good Movies But Especially My Girl Friday.,"I really like Cary Grant and this DVD has two of his movies, His Girl Friday and Penny Serenade. They are both good movies but personally I think His Girl Friday is the better of the two and in this one Cary Grant stars as a newspaper editor who does eveything he can to keep his star reporter (Rosalind Russell) who also happens to be his ex-wife from retirement and getting married to an insurance agent played by Ralph Bellamy. The whole cast is wonderful but especially Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Penny Seranade is good and about a couple with marital problems who want to adopt a child and his costar is Irene Dunne who starred in two screwball comedies with him, My Favorite Wife and The Awful Truth but truth to be told I preferred their screwball comedies to their dramatic movie. Penny Serenade is good but it's a little too melodramatic for my taste!"
4,The Funkin Best,"I bought this cd at a concert I saw the band play at Clarkson University. It has great sound and can keep the party bumpin' all night long! The only reason I gave it four stars rather that five is because the guitarist on the cd is diffrent than the one I saw at the show, and the guitarist at the show blows the one on the cd away! Plus his dreadlocks rule!"
2,"If you love crazy camera work and empty NYC scenes, buy this","If you love The National, you should buy it too...but only for the EP. The DVD is absolutely terrible and a waste of an hour.Vincent Moon is trying desperately to make The National a legend. It's almost like he's hoping either the lead singer will die early or the band will become really famous eventually, and he can claim dibs on their first documentary. Moon does the right thing in bringing the music to the forefront, but it hurts the interviews, which I could barely hear or understand. Tons of time is wasted on meaningless scenes of NYC or nearly empty rooms. They hyper saturated color is annoying to watch. No one is as dramatic as Moon makes The National out to be. It's absolutely dreadful as a rock doc, a film, and a document of recording one of the great albums of 2007.Moon should have watched ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"" to learn how to make a movie about making a great album."
2,Waste of time,"I love The National and was excited to see some behind-the-scenes stuff in the documentary. Unfortunately, it's just lame, art school dropout stuff."
4,"A PERFECT COMPANION TO HER EXPANDED EDTION OF ""GOLDEN HITS"" (ESPECIALLY IF YOU GOT A TIGHT BUDGET!)","Only four (4) repeats from the Expanded Edition of ""Sarah Vaughan's Golden Hits"" album. Get pass that you have a Well-Put-Together Package from the start to the Finish! Culled from her mid 50's to early 60's recordings for Mercury Records. Key Cuts: ""How High The Moon"", ""I'm Glad There Is You"", ""Dedicated To You"" featuring Billy Eckstine on vocals!, ""Shulie A Bop"", ""Stardust"", and ""Sassy's Blues"". 18 (Eighteen) Tracks in all!...Under and/Or around $7.00 or 12.00, now who could ask for more???"
5,Excellent,"These were exceptionally tasty. I used them over a pasta salad and it was delicious. I especially like combining the bruschetta and the basil. I can't wait to try them for dipping Italian bread. I ordered a second set as a gift. They were shipped via Fedex Smartpost. They broke the bottles, which I imagine is hard to do because they're packed extremely well. I've had all types of problems with Fedex Smartpost. Unfortunately more and more vendors are using them, including Amazon themselves. I just wish Amazon had a way of letting the customer know when a vendor is using Fedex Smartpost. I wouldn't order from that vendor. Although I love the customer service of ""Fine Italian Food"" and their products, I'll have to think long and hard before I order from them again."
4,delicious!,"They came packaged appropriately, no damage. The bottles are attractive. I really like the infused flavor. They have a wonderful flavor."
2,Loves olive oil,I received this giftset for Christmas. I've tried all 4 flavors a variety of ways & I don't care for any of them. Maybe it's because they're flavored.
5,shout at the devil cd- motley crue,"good choice, prompt shipping. All songs good going back to the true roots of rock and roll. Would recommend this cd to anyone who appreciates good music"
5,Shout at the devil,I loved this album.It rocks so hard!Its the Crue at it best.Its a must have for sure.
5,THEIR OLD STUFF IS BEST,"This album has alot of great songs. this was definatly the high point of the career. my favorites are ""Shout at the devil"" ""Looks that kill"" and ""Too young to fall in love"" overall a 5 star album"
5,Motley Crue At Its Best!!!,"This albums is truly a heavy metal masterpiece! It is raw and edgy and has that ""hungry for success"" sound. It is not full of fluff like so many other 80's metal bands. Thankfully, it has not lost its punch when being remastered. I have a hard time picking an absolute favorite song, but Too Young To Fall In Love, Bastard, Red Hot, and Ten Seconds To Love are just awesome to listen to. They did a great version of the Beatles' Helter Skelter. This album is more like the Judas Priest and Iron Maiden of this time period-rockin' but defintitely not pop!!!If you're ready for head-banging, fist-pounding music-this is it!"
5,ravage24/7,Simply said the best band in the world at there best musically!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am the biggest Crue fan out there and this cd has all the punch you in face with no apologizes attitude a hard rock fan can ask for.Motley Crue Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Cheap Gimmick!! Keep Your Ol' Album!!,"I've been a Crue fan since this album came out, when every kid on my block sat around listening to it. Now, 25 years later they re-release their albums again. This gimmick is also done by the movie industry who keep re-releasing DVDs after a while. Now I love this album as much as anyone, that's why they got 2-stars; I subtracted 3-stars for selling us an album we've already got, why not just do that in the first place? It's not like they just ""found"" some lost footage!For the fans who got the record, the tape, the CD, and who were dumb enough to buy any ""special edition"" CD's afterward, PLEASE stay away from these cheap cons!! Save your money for food, heat, clothes, anything else but crap that you already have!!"
1,OH MY FREAKING GOD,"im sorry i just had to comment on this.... are all of you out of your f*cking minds?!?!? motley crue is horrible! they look like women on the cover,and the guy on the top left does the devil horns wrong. it's without the thumb, you idiot! and if you think that ANY of them have any talent, then you must be retarded. and yes, that includes tommy lee. he is NOT a good drummer. if you wanna hear some good music, go back a decade further to the 70s. listen to some led zeppelin, black sabbath. go a couple years back from there, and listen to some hendrix too. those guys are insanely better than than these p*ssies. the best thing to come out of the 80s was guns n' roses. It's bands like motley crue that plagued the radios with their horrible music."
4,Happy with Westin,"Step bar arrived in a couple days UPS. Packaging was very well done. One thing had me worried, when reading the spec's on Amazon site, the length of the bar that fit my 1996 Pathfinder listed 3"" round and 73"" long and my SUV measured 68"" betweenthe front and rear tires, too long. But on westin web site the same part number fit my vehicle but gave no measurements.Glad I ordered this step bar because it fit perfectly, was about 63"" long and the brackets bolted to original holes with no problem and they look great, Black step bar and all black SUV, As always great Amazon service."
4,A Job Well Done,"For the first 120 pages this was one of the best books I have ever read. It was faced paced and I became an instant fan of Nicholas Tartaglia. I thought the last 50 pages were a little too unrealistic, even if you are willing to believe in Witches and Black Magic. There were also many (i.e., more than 10) grammatical errors throughout the book. I still give it 4 stars."
3,Cookbook,"This was an ok cookbook, but I did not find any stellar recipes. Ideas were nice to use as far as keeping things minimalist."
3,When they say this is for a teeny kitchen they sure mean it!,"The downside: The recipes in here are super-basic; if you're looking for innovative cuisine, this ain't it. Also, given the setups described here, I suddenly felt like my 10x10 kitchenette was the galley at Buckingham Palace by comparison.The good side: If you ever have to cook in an RV, in a shared cooking space (think dorm), and are literally reduced to hot plates, a toaster oven, and one burner and one pot, this is your book. I could see this being a fantastic resource for a student living in a Very Tiny Apartment with a half-sized fridge and two burners. Some of these recipes could probably even be done with camping equipment. Also, the instructions are very good and it really does ""start at the beginning,"" so if you're shipping off your kid to college and they can't boil water, they won't starve to death or burn the dorm down using this book."
3,Tenba PB-17C Backpack,"This is a fabulous backpack ... perfectly fits all of your camera gear, laptop, and extras. The only problem is once you put your stuff in it, it is nearly too heavy to lift. There was no way I could put it on my back or carry it for more than a few minutes and I consider myself to be a stronger than average woman. I had to return it."
2,This NOT the one!,"This book simply didn't grab me and hold me the way a love story should. I don't really feel as though the relationship between Sharron and Ant reached the level that it should have. The book moved tooooooo slowly... and had lot's of unnecessary information about unimportant characters in the book. This is the second time that I have been burned by Omar... three strikes and you're out. The bottom line is... don't waste your time, money, or effort!"
2,Very Slow,"Although the storyline was interesting, the manner in which the story unfolded was slow and boring. Time just seemed to drag as I read this novel, but I finally plowed through and finished it. The last couple of chapters were the most interesting."
1,Zzzzzzzzzz,"I have to admit, I haven't been able to get past the first couple of chapters, but already this book is BOR-RING! The first Omar Tyree book I read was ""Flyy Girl"" and I hated it! But I gave him a try again with ""Do Right Man"" and ""Single Mom"" and thought both books were okay. But I am so sorry I spent my hard-earned money on this story. I love and treasure books, but this one is so bad I'm considering the unthinkable: throwing it away! I hate to dis a brotha, but Omar, you've got to come harder than this, baby!"
2,Sweet St. Louis is not so Sweet,"I have enjoyed everything I have read by Omar Tyree until now. Sweet St. Louis was the most slow moving, and uninteresting book I have read in a very long time. Not to mention, every character with the exception of Ant, was extremely annoying. I think Sharron did an overkill on the line that brought the two together, ""A piece of you...."". Along with the fact her character asked far to many questions.I am sure there was a lesson to be learned, but I certainly learned nothing. Perhaps, I would have if I could relate to the characters, but fortunately, I don't know anyone as annoying as those characters.I hope the Omar's sequel to ""Fly Girl"" is a lot better."
4,A Piece Of Me For A Piece Of You,That line is what brought two people together. The story was enlightening and I enjoyed the characters. Ant was the man with a plan and Sharon was in search of love. The two became and a couple and I enjoyed how they interacted with each other. The book was interesting.
1,What happened?!!,"I was all set to read yet another well written book by Mr. Tyree. Well, that I didn't get. I agree with the reviewer who said they only kept reading to see what,if anything, of interest was going to happen. I remember finishing the book and being happy it was over. I did laugh a few times, but overall, I didn't enjoy this book. Wouldn't recommend it AT ALL. Not giving up on Omar though."
2,Omar is really loosing his touch,"the book flyy girl was the bomb, but sweet st louis had the equivalent of a bomb blown up. this was an uneventful and repetitive story that ventures into the lives of two black people that really don't have much to say in the least. this was a hard book to even begin to read. then at the end he just left you hangin, not like the book was good or nuthin, but the simple fact that DAG you make me read this boring ish, and then you don't even want to finish it off. i gave it 2 stars because it had some type of potential under all of that preachy behind dialouge. i think omar just writes books to put his picture on the back cover, because i surely do know that he can't be writing for any type of entertainment."
4,Just a few more pages!,"When I turned the page a realized that the book was over, I was crushed. I wanted just a couple more pages.Though the book started off mind of slow, I enjoyed it overall. It took me a few evenings and a trip to the hair shop to finish the book. Hopefully, you'll enjoy the book as I did."
3,Bittersweet,"Sweet St. Louis is just as sweet as honey until the end. The characters are well-developed, but you feel like you're being dropped at the end.What happened with Tone? Does Celena see the error of her ways? Do Sharron and Ant stick it out?I graciously await the answers in the form of, perhaps, a sequel. This was my first Omar Tyree novel, but I'm starting Flyy Girl soon. I KNOW there's a sequel to that one."
4,About time!! (tforre7777@yahoo.com),"This novel is a classic depiction of a romantic comedy, from the jovial expressions to the sensuous lovemaking Omar Tyree takes us on a journey of an urban love story so often not told. Tyree's words jump off the pages causing the reader to hunger for more and more!Tyree introduces us to friends and lovers whom are all too familiar within our everyday lives. You will find yourself exploding with extreme laughter, and cooing with ooooh's and aaaaaah's. Sweet St. Louis is a love story waiting to be inhaled!"
2,Sweet St. Louis,"It was difficult to stay focused while reading this book. It just didn't grab my attention right away. It was definitely NOT a quick read! Also the characters weren't very interesting. The males were very stereotypical and as a black female, I couldn't relate to the main character--Sharon at all!"
3,Okay......but not great.,"It took me a long time to finish the book because it was a very slow read. I couldn't get into it, yet I was determine to finish it, knowing that it had to get better. The characters were too absorbed in themselves and Sharon just got on my nerves trying to analyze everything. All in all, I think the book could have used more action and Tyree could have done a better job.My mother gave me ""Fly Girl"" to read and I hope it doesn't drag nearly as much as this one did."
4,If your looking for a Sweet Love story with many twists....,"Omar Tyree portrays the life of four young African-Americans who endure the ups and downs of the dating game. Sharron, a witty intelligent 24 year old airport employee who has a passion for challenges befriends long time player ""Ant""hony Poole. Ant, who is well known in the St. Louis club scene as a player and smooth talker, reluctantly falls in the trap of love. This novel keeps you wondering and waiting."
2,Wasnt Feelin It,"ok, im a lil biased because i live in St.Louis and i know that writers sometimes take liberties when writing....but this book had more flaws than an FBI investigation (oops, did i say that?) while the plot was cool...the book was slow at some places as if the writer was bored and didnt have anything to really write about.....and then it seemed the he didnt really research the city or its people (sorry, we dont use the whole name when talking about the airport!!!). since Fly Girl, this writers work has been going down hill FAST!!!PS...black men do read!!!"
1,Antwan (his real name) not Omar,I agree. This book is not as focused as the beginners the story line was weak and it just seemed as if he was occipied with something else.
2,Reader from the Chi,I have to be totally honest. Of all the books of Omar Tyree this has to be the worse. I loved the others but this one is very slow and kind of narrative. It gets juicy in some parts then it's like dull. I would recommend it to a writer that wants to get some pointers of what not to write about. Why couldn't he just say STL instead of St. Louis International Airport? Things of that nature is what made this book a little dull.
1,What in the world?!!!,"Omar, what in the world were you thinking hon? Did you really get input from those on your ""shout out list"". If so, I need to call them. This book is slow, the characters immature, story-line drags AND well....this just AIN'T(yeah I said ain't) a good book. This is probably one of the worst books I've read in awhile. I hate to say it, but I definitely do recommend it. I couldn't wait for it to end. And the way it ended..goodness!! I missed sleep because I couldn't stand to pick it the next day."
1,Please Remove His Computer From His House!,"If someone would please do me and the rest of the readers a favor and remove his computer, word processor, notebook, pens and pencils, we might be spared another Omar Tyree novel! After reading the dreadfully boring College Boy, I didn't think Omar could possibly write another novel as bad as that one. While not quite as awful as College Boy, Sweet St. Louis is a close second. Filled with page after page of long, boring narrative, this book took forever to go anywhere and forever to get to a point (assuming that there was a point, that is). I won't be reading another book by him again as there are way too many better authors than him to choose from."
3,Slow St. louis,I must stay I had heard so many great things about the book but once I began to read it I must say it was very slow however I did enjoy the characters friend to me they kept the book alive
1,Too Slow!!,Sweet St.Louis was a horrible love story. The story was so slow and boring that it took me forever to read this book. I don't understand what Omar was trying to do with this book. Borrow it from the library.
5,A true to life story!,"Sometimes, novels do not portray a story that many people can say is real. But Tyree did just that with this book! Now, who says a male can not describe a women in written words! Nice work Tyree!"
1,Would give it no stars,This is the worse book I ever read. The only reason that I finished it was because I thought it would get better or there would be a suprise ending. Not the case. Don't waste your time. Omar Tyree has definately fallen off in the writing department. Somebody stop him!
2,Good Job Again Omar,"i've read every book of Omar, i'm a reader i love to read and one day hope to be a writer, Omar keep up with your works, your books is an inspiration for me to contunue my dream."
2,TEDIOUS,"This book limped along... Very slow moving, and yeah, how many times is she gonna remind him of that same tired line?Took forever to get started and... *sigh* Im bored just typing this review. Definitely no Michael Baisden, or Eric Jerome Dickey here.Colin 'Waiting in Vain' Channer... where are you?"
3,He Can Do Better....,"We read this in April for our bookclub. We feel you Omar; but, you're preaching to the choir. The characters could have been developed better. The storyline was good -- why did it take me so long to read this book? I cared nothing about the characters. I think a reviewer wrote below, that it's much easier to be critical of someone work, as opposed to writing it.I think Omar is a talented writer -- he just hasn't reached is peak yet. I'm afraid the next book by him I will have to wait for the paperback version..."
1,P triple U,"Omar, whatzup? This book, this collection of pages you asked us to read, what's it supposed to be? Not a story, not a book comparable to your other work. In order to prove it wasn't just me I passed this book onto my girlfriend who loves your work. She handed it back to me in three days! She told me it was unreadable. Omar, pull up. You know this one was not suppose to be out there for us to see. Peace and love, Breezee"
4,"Sweet,Sweet St.Louis","This Book was really personal for me, because it took time to develope the chractors and it brought back a lot of memories. The way that Omar explained every detail of the relationship between Ant and Sharon was masterful. She mad the right decision at the end. Giving their love a chance inspite of all the bad vibes from Sharon's room mate. that was her life and I am glad that she decided to live with Ant. I am also happy that Ant will expire his ""Players Card"" for a while. Good move Ant; don't mess up a good thing enjoy it while you can."
2,Disappointing,I'd heard so may good things about this author that I had to go out and buy one of his books but I was so very disappointed. I'm now wondering if it's even worth it to try his others. This one is definitely s boring read.
2,"So ""Ghetto"", it was embarrassing","I forced myself to finish the book to give it a fair read. The characters were immature and didn't seem to have much of a clue that there were other ways of doing things or issues much larger than their own little world. Although the author eventually makes his point, I definitely Do Not recommend this book. I did however, give a rather scary look into the mind of a ""player"". Hopefully women who read it will take the hint and not even get mixed up with this type, however smooth their line is."
2,WILL THE REAL OMAR TYREE PLEASE STAND UP!,"This is the third book I've read by O.T. and the worst. I like the way the relationship developed between Ant Poole and what's her name, but something was definitely missing. I usually read a book in less than 2 days when it grabs my attention, but this one took me 2 weeks. I read other authors works entirely through, while trying to get through this one.Don't waste your money, go to the library or if someother misguided person rushed out and brought the hard cover like me, then profit from their stupidity; as my sister did me.She just called and told me that she's had the book for a week and is only on page 26. She is also an avid reader who reads a ""good read"" in quick quick time.Hope to hear from the brother soon with the types of books I know he can put out."
1,what happenend?,"I am an avid fan of Mr. Tyree's works. BUT, what in the world happened here? This is his most disappointing work to date. I hope his next novel will make up for the utter disappointment that this one produced."
5,The first one I used; the best one I used.,"Bob Weiner asks the questions and the Bible answers them. All of the books by Bob and Rose Weiner use the scripture for their answers. This is great for an individual study or a group study. My home church used this book for many years as a discipleship tool for new believers. It deals with the basics of Christianity and shows the link between the old and new testaments. Because it uses question and answer format, you will need a group leader than can supplement a discussion with personal testimony about how the scriptures applied to their own life. (If you second guess yourself about the black and white answers of the Bible, you can find them in the back of the book.)"
5,Awesome Bible Study,This is one of the greatest foundational studies around. It never gets old or dated. It is perfectely systematic! More churches ought to return to systematic teaching to strengthen the lives of their members. The whole series focuses on basic doctrine with how to live the Christian life! Not dry theology or doctrine... It's doctrine with life skills.
5,Great Bible Study!,This is a great bible study. I am using it to disciple a couple of young men and it works great!
1,OPened no doors...,"I bought two of these garage door openers; neither worked. Further, it was seemly not possible to open the device to set the codes without nicking the case because the plastic case was so soft that it nicked no matter how gently I attempted to open them. I want my money back!"
5,Works great with old Stanley doors!!,"After I placed the order, while doing some more research, I questioned whether I ordered the right product. I called the company and was told that it was the wrong one. He took care of changing the order, sending the right opener and making sure my credit card was charged accordingly. I have used this opener on my scooter for more than a year now - used hook and loop tape and put it in a little storage compartment on the dash - works perfect!"
3,Fair - breaks easy - ok for temp boundary training,"Good if you don't walk next to them - very brittle. Good for temporary boundary testing. If left at perimeter in woods, they are not too resilient. Priced accordingly."
2,flags are very small,"These flags are so small my dog wasn't even noticing them, defeating the whole idea of containment since she wasn't aware of the barrier. Now, in defense of the manufacturer, it's winter in Ohio and the ground is white with snow, making the puny white flags almost invisible. So I bought some plastic safety-orange 1"" wide tape, cut 6 inch lengths and stapled them to the flags. That worked."
3,Get the metal ones,"These flags are brittle plastic. They snap easily. I had to 'predrill' for every one with a screwdriver. The metal ones are much easier to install. On the other hand, the plastic ones are easier on the lawn mower. The picture appears to be the metal variety but that is not what i received."
2,"Does what it needs to do, but not much else","These flags are cheaply made. Plastic pole breaks or bends most of the time when pushing it into the ground. You'll need to use a screw driver to ""pre-drill"" the holes in the ground. Plan on replacing them, or just buy the metal ones for a couple bucks more."
1,Piece of crap,"These flags are a piece of crap. They're way too small, and the plastic stems break very easily. Do yourself a favor and go to Gemplers and get the 15"" metal flags...100 for 8 bucks."
4,Great CD,"If you like Ella, Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong you will definitely appreciate this album. This is the type of music you could expect to hear in a jazz club in Harlem in the 50s, it has that type of flavor. What a ""Difference a Day Makes"" will be a sure repeater.I really enjoyed this CD as a newbie to Dinah Washington. My favorite and most listened to tracks begin after track nine, as tracks 10 on up have better sound quality and are her more popular songs. One song I found quite entertaining was the song in which she sang about a new invention called TV. This was especially funny, being that TV in America is as common as the air we breathe."
3,Bad Casting,"The video itself is pretty good and it's interesting to hear Ellis speak about his works and the thoughts behind them. I also enjoyed the interviews the big flap surrounding American Psycho. However, as one reviewer noted, the actor playing Patrick Bateman was a horrible choice - not good looking, saggy body - certainly not anything like Christian Bale's portrayal in the movie. This made the AM Psycho re-enactments ""less than zero."""
4,Richard Ahl,"Although I have been married twice, I have only been in love once, and although my first marriage lasted 12 years, and my second has lasted over twenty years, I still think of the love of my life, and what might have happened......we met and fell deeply in love to Ray Conniff, and 'For all we know' was playing constantly at the time. For many reasons we parted, and we both went on to marry someone else. By a strange twist of fate we happened to meet some 20 years later, and having talked for a short while, I had to leave the room, the feelings were still so strong. Ray Conniff, you have a lot to answer for, this album brings back so many happy memories, but as they say, 'it is better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved' ..."
1,Power management problems / Crazy re-booting thing,"I bought the new top of the line Core Duo and had 1 ghz RAM installed when I purchased the thing at Comp USA.It has been nothing but headaches so far after recording a full band (using Apple's new Logic software) and having the unit restart every 5 to 20 minutes for the last month! I'm returning it tomorrow. Trust me, if you need a workhorse of a computer, this is not it. It just looks cool."
5,Author's contribution to forum discussions cause me to buy this,"While this book may be a bit below the level I need, I will buy this book just because of the helpful, insightful, and courteous contributions Tom Igoe has made to floundering experimenters in online forums that I occasionally read. His responses to questions have been unfailingly clear and to the point. I am confident that he has enough to say to justify the price."
2,Disappointing,I got this book knowing it would be Basic based however I figured I could pick up some technique and knowledge anyway. I found the book to be vague and superficial. Lacking detail on the examples provided while lacking good examples.
5,Tons of practical information,"Great boek - very practical - general approach of connecting any device to a computer.This book helped me very much in understanding and building the interaction between the pc and selfbuild electronic devices and sensors. It explanes the basics of programming, standard solutions, electronics, protocols. For me it was the ideal practical bridge between all my chaotic knowledge of techniques, standaards, practical skills...to make it coherent.Because it aproaches the microprocessor from high level to low level, (plug and play packages versus the naked chip and resistors) and 4 different pic-manufactures it realy offers the basics an clarifies the direction where to look for your specific specialisation."
5,Amazing Resource!,I have been referring to both of the authors' web sites for a year or so now whenever I have some sort of technical problem to solve. I was elated to find out they had finally published this book and ordered it right away. This is the most comprehensive book on the subject of electronics and computation for artists and designers.
5,Timeless classic CD,"I recently purchased the Manhattans CD, Kiss and Say Goodbye, for my husband for our anniversary in September. I was thoroughly impressed with how quickly it was shipped to me as promised with the expedited service. I could not find it in any music stores in my area. My husband was thrilled with this gift. The songs are terrific......a very good choice for anyone interested in their music!! A true classic CD."
3,"Best of Kiss and say Goodbye, Manhattans","This cd was ok, too much of the same ole. I had heard the kiss and say goodbye, but I'm not to impressesd with the whole cd"
3,The Smooth R&B and Classic Soul 70's!,"""Blue"", Gerald, Eddie and the guys were what you wanted to see, anywhere they performed. They came all the from New York to perform in the Southeast Underground (Washington, D.C.) in 1975 and I've been a true fan ever since. This album has a real sleeper on it, ""The Day The Robin Sang To Me"". Today, there are two (2) Manhattan's. Eddie Bivins has a group, but there is only one Gerald Alston."
5,Best Love Songs Album of Manhattans.,"You can find the songs that were already discontinued producing. The ""goodbye is the saddest word"" is the most touch-mind song. It's still the most valuable to buy from Manhattans."
4,clarity,"I concur with the review above. The DVD is very amateuristic, but who cares? As a dancer - advanced in Oriental dance, but complete beginner in Flamenco - I don't want to sit on the coach and gaze at a wonderfully edited DVD. I want to practice and dance myself!This DVD contains for at least 2 months Flamenco practice for me. For the price of one single workshop."
2,flamenco,arrived broken but they replaced it with no problems.. for begginers only.. a different syle for me.
2,Disappointing,"I think I didn't know what to expect because I'm a total novice but I wasn't very inspired by Maria's video. It all looked the same to me and the performances were weak. I want to feel something when I watch a flamenco dancer - all I could feel was ""when is this over?"" Not worth it."
3,Kokoro Nature - Giver of Blessin,"I am looking for the video of Lois Lowry's, The Giver. I am unsure if ""Kokoro's Nature-Give of Blessin"" is the correct match. Can anyone that has seen the video confirm? Thank you!"
1,fascist conformity,"this book teaches kids how to be civillized, non-threatening, subservients to protocol. it puts children at a ""lesser status""----then it says ""Please don't have a fit about this status thing. It doesn't mean that royals are better than commoners, women are better than men, or adults are better than children. It's just the way things are done."" (so much for social change in this country!) other examples from the book: Why do you have to be nice to ignorant jerks?--because you never know when one of them might be a Hollywood talent agent. (talk about a warped sense of the world) listed under the commandments of classroom etiquette for students: thou shalt not act bored or fall asleep in class(that's not acting) perhaps i am too sharp but it seems to me that this ""funny"" book is not so ""funny"" afterall."
4,Great book!,"Most teenagers will love this book but not all. One grandson and one granddaughter thought it was very helpful, a third grandchild did not like it. It deals with real kids' issues and problems and gives then actual things they can say, as well as what not to say. It even has some very good advice for how teenagers can talk to their parents. Best of all, it has lots of humor in it. We read parts of it aloud with a teenage grandson and we were all laughing. It has good advice for non-teenagers too."
4,A super guide for teens,"I am surprised that this book, ""How Rude"" is nearly out of print and that the demand has not been higher. Perhaps it's because more reviews should be written. It would make a fine text for a step-by-step guide and instruction manual for an etiquette course for teenagers.The book provides a natural way of talking and reading for teenagers. The stories are interesting and all are good examples of how to practically apply manners.I would like to obtain many copies of the book and use it in the classes I teach to teenagers."
1,caution! This is trash.,"I appreciate good manners so I ordered several copies for my grandchildren. Unfortunately, covering topics of what to do if you walk in on ""your parents making love,"" and the decision process on teens entering into sexual activity including ""who should buy the condems,"" assumes and endorces barbaric behavior as the norm. (parents should buy a door lock! Are they really so ""inconsiderate"" of their kids?) I was a teen in the 60s and grew-up with the ""love"" generation. I'm not out of touch with reality but through the years, I have observed the devastation of people who are so smart that they can live without morality. I hoped for more because the book had great potential and some sections were well done, but the ""secular progressive agenda"" is apparent. Teens don't need this message reinforced. Porn magazines say so on the cover--this is veiled as a book that teaches consideration for others. It is trash."
2,be aware,"I bought this book for my 12 year old son. I found the majority of the book acceptable, entertaining and informative . However the book also had sections geared towards older teens (I assume). I was surprised to find information regarding who should bring the condom on the date and other sexual issues. The book states that wether or not teens should be sexually active is not a topic of this book but if you are sexually active it is beyond rude to....and goes on to list a number of sexual situations.I was hoping to share this book with my son as I think he could benefit from it. However, I'll be putting it aside until I feel we have discussed some of the sexual issues addressed by the book and he is mature enough to handle it.It's too bad because I think he'd be more likely to want the other information now while he is excited about starting junior high and wanting to be treated as an adult.I"
1,not very helpful,"How do you overcome procrastination? The author takes a whole book to say, in effect, ""Just do it."" Thanks. If that worked, my mother would have broken me of my habit when I was twelve."
1,DEFECTIVE PURCHASE,JUST got home to my purchase. Sealed and all. But upon opening the safe itself. The grey plastic money tray is broken in the upper left hand corner. I hope customer care can resolve this PROBLEM. And I hope this isn't a habit of sentry safe. Many people trust that you will deliver their purchases IN TACT. I'd like a replacement. I'd happily rewrite my review upon a resolution.
1,Received wrong item!,"I received the wrong item and have no idea what to do so that I could receive the one I want....... So pretty much I got a combination lock, rather than a sentry safe large cash box -_-"
4,"Perfect, except for one detail...","This is a nice, heavy cash box with a real keyed lock - it would be hard to get into without the key. The metal is solid, the plastic tray is sturdy, and there is plenty of space inside for receipts, cash, etc.My only complaint is that there isn't any way to latch the box except by key. It cannot be picked up by the handle unless it is locked shut. I will solve the problem with a bungee cord, but I think something like this should latch, and ALSO lock, so that it can be used w/o the key, carried around, moved, etc, and not have to be locked every time.B+"
2,"Horrible lock, easily bypassed",The box itself is great. however the key/lock mechanism is unbelievably cheap. it took my friend only a minute to pick it with a paper clip.
2,not very protective,I don't really like this safe it dosent look very protective it is a large metal box with a small lock that could be breaken into easily and is not fireproof
5,"Works great, great price, exactly what I was looking for.","There's a good amount of space, the lock unlocks and locks very easy and it's secure enough to keep kids out. Or people at your house. But if someone has time and they're really working at it they can open this safe without the key. It's not that strong, but I'm not too worried about that anyways, people are always in my house. Great for holding cash, has cash holder, jewelry, weapons, whatever."
4,Well Made,"Just the right gauge of steel, does not twist or tweek, the cash tray plastic is nice and thick, the reason for 4 stars are 1) the handle is hard to grab, 2) slight bend would fix that and it might sound trivial but the name plate was culrled up and only stuck on about a quarter inch of it. Would recomend and would buy again."
5,Purchased for my grandson ...,"He loves this for keeping track of his savings, and special keepsakes that he likes to lock up. Not for just a kid though. This is a perfect box for anyone."
4,Alright,"what a coincidence, yesterday I got my safety box and today i went to walmart with my girlfriend i saw that they have all types of safety boxes from the same brand and the good part is that those are very cheap u cant believe it. this one right here is $12 and there is some better ones if you r looking for a bigger and cooler."
5,Perfect for my teenage son!,This is a great little safe for my teenage son. It is large enough for him to stash his personal belongings.
3,Doesn't stay closed,The tray inside came broken but the annoying issue is the box will not stay shut unless it is locked.
2,Find a more modern work on this topic.,"I tried to read this book, but the fact that so many historians have recently debunked Aries' conclusions made it seem almost unnecessary to read. One thing is certain, Aries did spark a lot of research into this are of history. I was mainly interested in reading it for references to clothing, and toys. The book talks more about schooling than the subjects I was interested. I never finished the book."
3,acceptable,"Product was what I was expected, but it took too long to get here. I had to wait over 14 days."
1,The *worst* pregnancy book I've read....,"and I read them all!! Seriously, I hated this book. The one thing that most offended me about this book is the part where she suggests that women should be prepared for the fact that their husbands might cheat on them while they're pregnant. Given that I had toxemia and was swelled up like the Stay-Puft marshmallow woman, that was the last thing I wanted to hear! I don't think it's especially true, and is certainly unsupportive. The book also induced some moments of paranoia in me, particularly the section on which drugs are safe/unsafe in pregnancy. She lists sulfa drugs as unsafe, and I was prescribed one of them for a UTI in the beginning of my third trimester. You can imagine the panicked call to my OB after I read that. Pass this book by. Almost any book out there is better. ""What to Expect"" is just as comprehensive, if not more so (though it too has some paranoia-inducing moments). ""The Pregnancy Book"" by Wm. Sears is also good. Anything but this book!"
1,Contradictory and Paralyzing,"Hotchner may as well tell women to remain under house arrest. We can't pump our own gas? We should be wary of even DECAF tea? C'mon! After reading this book, I felt paralyzed--and thorougly depressed.In addition, much of the information was contradictory or even false, especially concerning foods to eat. One minute she says salmon's O.K.; the next, it's not. And her mantra ""pregnant women should drink only WHOLE milk"" is suspicious. I've read in other books that pregnant women should stick with skim or low-fat b/c of blood-pressure risks, not to mention all the fat!I am throwing my copy out . . ."
1,Not Even Worth One Star...,"This is truly the worst reference book for pregnant women to ever hit the market. First of all, it's poorly written and difficult to follow. Secondly, there are no illustrations. I'm sorry that I paid money for this book.My advice: Pass this one by!!"
3,You get what you pay for,"I've used this for two gigs & 2nd CD player is breaking down on me. It's working now but unknown for how long. Plays all brand Karaoke CD's perfectly but Does take about 5 to 10 seconds to play the karaoke tracks (this is a long time when your doing a professional gig & cannot have silence between songs). Will play only 95% of all songs on a burned CD. Single cue on both decks is great (when on track stops it plays the next on the other deck & keeps switching on own. The cord between the control & the player comes loose easily & you have to check it before each gig. It's a great player for a church, home use or if you wanna add Karaoke to your DJ rack but it is delicate stuff."
3,Good value for the $$$,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I will base my opinion on cost, value, durability etc. I agree with their review in the sense that UNDER HARD USE Gemini units will not stand up. However, unlike radio stations, most users are not running their equipment 24x7x365 and swapping discs after every track and thus won't likely be burning out their CD player in a few months... As Amazon's own ad reads ""For DJs that require an inexpensive solution, while still providing essential features""... This unit would be best used in smaller clubs/churches/restaurants where the equipment isn't being jostled around running gig to gig.No this unit isn't Denon or Numark that comes with $1000+ price tag. This is a ~$200... and it is worth every penny... (& and for ~$29 you can add a 2nd year's warrantee if you are the cautious type)"
3,Nothing special,Diamond D's LP is nothing special. There's only 2 good songs on it. Hiatus and 5 fingaz of Death but it's just average... unfortunatelly...
3,What is this?,"This falls short of his previous work. I was disppointed. I still can't enough of his first album. The songs best kept secret, sally, pass that ***, feel the vide, and I went for mine are classic. Stick with the first album and wait for more from Diamond."
3,All Right!,This album is no where as good as his first one!! Sally still is number one!! Best kept secret!!
1,HOT STEAMING TRASH,"This is a sorry follow-up to the classic ""Stunts, Blunts, and Hip Hop"". There are a few tracks (""This One"", ""Hiatus"", ""Neva Gonna Give you Up"", and ""Projects"") that easily stand out amongst the pile of garbage that is so sickening with tired loops and a flow and delivery that sounds like Diamond has been mixing NyQuil with his queludes. I loved the first album and ran to purchase this one. I wanted to cry when I heard it. I met Diamond a month before this record dropped and he swore it was better than his first. He lied to me. (...)"
4,What kind of Mother will I be?,"I received this book from my Grandmother when I found out I was pregnant with my son. Reading through the pages was such a comfort for me; for you see, I am married to a sailor, and the birth of our son was very close to my husband going to sea and being gone 6 months. I had all the questions, concerning ""can I do it alone?"" and ""do I really want a baby right now?"" This book and a whole lot of prayer got us through. My son is now 20 years old. I am so glad the book is still in print, for I am now going to pass on the wisdom to a new generations of ""Moms""."
5,Great continuation of the Series,"This is the third book in David Coe's five book series entitled ""Winds of the Forelands"".I am finding that each book is better than the book before.If you have read the other books the story just gets deeper and more interesting as the story proceeds.The intrigue, betrayals, and hardships that some of the characters have to go through are amazing.The changing of alliances and repercussions will even make you wonder whom to trust.The story is original and refreshing.Mr Coe is one of the authors whose titles I am always waitng for the new one to come out.And this one was no exception and well worth the wait because of the publication delays in the title coming out.I can not wait for the next book in this exciting series."
2,Lost Focus in Bonds of Vengeance,"I've read his Tobyn-Ser series and it was well and tightly written. Great world building and character development.His first two book in the Foreland series were just as well written, but his third book Bonds of Vengenace looses focus with reptitive scenes of assasination and endlessly new characters, as well as, endlessly new kingdoms with their own political intrigues that keeps cropping up to the point where you couldn't care less who they are and why they are even in the story. This book readd like a filler. There were moments when he touched on characters in the first two Foreland books which were much more interesting to read, but it was like watching soaps where each character gets his or her five minute in the sun. Even thought he is an excellent writer, this story just couldn't hold my attention. I found myself skipping chunk of the book till the end.Seriously, wait for it to come out in paperback. This book is a filler."
4,Unsettling account of an emperor,"PLOT: An uncompromising look at the Roman emperor Tiberius.From the book cover:* He ruled like a miser but lived in luxury and vice.* Women, boys -- even infants -- served his unnatural lust.* His persecution of Jews resulted in the death of Christ.* He was hated by nearly every human being alive.REVIEW: A fascinating look at Tiberius, who came to the throne late in his life. It paints a picture very different from the one viewers saw in the 1950's movie ""The Robe"" (where he seemed a kindly old uncle to his subjects.) It details how he eliminated all threats to his position on the throne and made the way clear for Caligula, son of Tiberius' stepdaughter, who -- as the author puts it -- ""almost made the Romans want Tiberius alive again."""
4,Jack White does it again,"I think Jack White is one of the most talented musicians out there. This album is another example of his talents. Very retro 70's sound, reminds me of early Led Zeppelin. I would recommened this album"
5,What a great Cd!,"This cd is absolutely amazing! I heard ""Steady As She Goes"" on the radio and had to hear the rest of it. It doesn't happen very often that you buy a new cd and end up liking EVERY song on it! ""Broken Boy Soldiers"" reminds me of Led Zeppelin. The other songs remind me of a combination of The Who, Ted Nugent and maybe the Beatles. Jack White and the rest of the band certainly have some major talent! I also liked it because it seems like they were having fun and really enjoyed making this cd."
3,great musicians make an OK record,"If you are a White Stripes fan, you really don't need to run out and buy this one. Like most ""super-groups"", the soul seems to get lost amongst the strong musicianship and this ends up sounding like a decent heavy pop record...not bad just not the meaty songs you get used to from the Stripes."
2,What a disappointment!,"I was very disappointed by this album. Jack White's impressive song writing ability kowtows to the pop mediocrity of Brendan Benson's. This album sounds very much like Benson's ""The Alternative to Love,"" which isn't awful, but isn't up to the level of even the least of the White Stripes' efforts. The album does feature some nice touches that are due, unquestionably, to White's influence, but overall, this album is more suited to a fan of Top 40 music:""I've got a rabbit, it likes to hopI've got a girl and she likes to shopThe other foot looks like it won't dropI had an uncle and he got shot.""These are not inspired lyrics."
2,everything is great nowadays,"Why does everything have to be so great nowadays? Every movie is ""a heart stopping thrill ride"", every book a pulitzer, every new band is the next Led Zeppelin. Fifteen minutes of fame has been weened down to fifteen seconds in my mind. Jack & company sound tired and laboured on this album. Is it supposed to be a pop album? Sounds more like prog rock with hints of pop. I read somewhere that they were trying to make their version of ""Nevermind"". Well, nevermind. If this band didn't have Jack White in it nobody would give two turds. I'm puttin' these songs in the recycled bin of my computer, right next to Wolfmother."
3,"Not quite worth it's ""stripes"".",Maybe I'm just too big a fan of the peppermint flavored albums to let myself go and like this. Maybe....but I think it's just not focused enough. It's a record built around one interesting song. Maybe they had a deadline or something.
4,refreshing. simply refreshing.,"musically the raconteurs prove to be genius. a careful blend of simple melody and abnormal harmony that comes together strangely but amazingly delightful. i was impressed with the entire album. however, the lyrics????? way below par. i was horrified that such musicians could come together so nicely and then kill it with absurd lyrics. a five year old could have written the chorus to much of their music. i mean come on! ""you've found yourself a friend, that knows you well But no matter what you do, you'll always feel as though you tripped and fell"" get real. but the raconteurs prove to be refreshing (even from the white stripes who would find a great bass line and then blow it out of proportion by repeating it constantly for the entire song)above all, definitely a good album."
3,"Great music, but just over 30 minutes","Really great stuff, but a 30-minutes cd is inexcusable. 5-star music, but minus 2 for quantity."
1,Jack White knows 3 chords and I'm sick of hearing them...,"Most under talented, overrated performer/entertainer in pop in the last 30 years. Terrible album. Indulgent, completely forgettable regurgitations of the things one learns when they first pick up an instrument. I don't think the whole amateur rock think is cute at all... Terrrrrrible..."
1,Jack S**t,"What boring music! I'm so glad Jack White has decided to make music for Pearl Jam fans because he has never been a real artist as much as a marketing strategy. This sounds like banal 70s corporate rock a la ""Boys are Back in Town."" Jack White is a self-loathing hipster fraud with no talent, can't play blues or anything original and his musical language cannot be pushed beyond a Coca-Cola commercial. Snooze Soldiers, Raconteurs of multiple yawners."
2,"""Jack White [...] Great Musician"" is ...","The biggest oxymoron ever written in a public fora. Those who praise J.W.'s musical talent obviously have never seen a music theory book in their lives! 'Tis shamefull and even disgraceful that so many folks actually believe guitar-banging, poor-voiced hacks like these guys are good musicians.I'm all for new genras, new styles, etc.; however, Raconteurs are neither a new style nor a new genra. They are simply put mediocre musicians aspiring to engage their young and perhaps naive audience with tried-and-true, time-tested beats with some half-way decent vocals to create a so-called album.This album has only one use: entertain yourself for about half an hour, then use it as a beverage coaster."
4,HAVENT HEARD IT YET BUT I WOULD BE GUESSING 4,Why does everything have to be great nowdays? i will answer your question mate..because life is so boring and s*** and unfair and it's good to have something to believe in..even if it isnt great...ART is the thing!cheers!Jazzman
3,Broken boy soldiers,An ok music cd.A few good songs on it.Spend your money on something else that you might like so you wont be disappointed like me.
1,Very disappointing Jack White group work,"Huge Jack White and White Stripes fan, but this has nothing worthy of discussing. Their other album would be a better choice to start with."
3,only a few good songs,"If all your looking for is alot of catchy singing then you may enjoy this album. If your looking for jack whites wailing guitar however, your looking in the wrong place. white stripes fans, especially those who have seen them live(under the blackpool lights is fantastic), know the incredible emotion that jack gets across through chrunching rythm and screaming leads. The only song on the album showing any instrumental skill is the amazing store bought bones. youll will find some great melodies in songs like steady as she goes and call it a day. but most of the tracks will lose your attention fairly quickly. lyrically it is quite good but not memorable. my reveiw most likely reeks of discontent due to the imense hype this album had. i give this album three stars because it IS better than most work out there. you may listen through the whole thing a few times after you first get it, but give it a couple months and all you will want to keep is a few individual songs."
3,3.5 stars Broken Boy Soilder,"This is a good album but I havn't got that much into it the way I do ""White Stripes"" & ""Greenhornes"" albums if I didn't know who the ""Greenhornes"" and ""White Stripes"" were I don't think I would be that much into this band. Best song on the album for me is 'Level' for obvious reason it rocks hard like granite, anyways I hope this is a one time deal because I am really looking foward to hearing a new ""Greenhornes"" album and that 6th ""White Stripes"" album Jack says he only needs 2min to record."
4,Jack White: analog boy in the digital world,"Buy it on vinyl; trust me on this. ""Broken Boy Soldiers"" is made to be played LOUD, and nothing does loud like vinyl. Jack White makes this old dude very happy by releasing his stuff on LP.And as to the ""it's only 30 minutes long"" nonsense? ""Rubber Soul"" is less than 30 minutes; Joni's ""Song to a Seagull"" is not much longer. As James Brown once said, ""You hit it and quit it"". Darn right; we're not buying groceries here.If you like '70s era Zep styled music, ""Broken Boy Soldiers"" is a must."
2,some side projects.............should stay on the sidelines,"With all of the hype surrounding the talented Jack White (and some of the other musicians in the Racontuers), you would expect a solid album from this side project......unfortunately, the album does not deliver.No one song sticks out for me as anything special.....the band just does not seem to have the same stripped-down, raw, bluesy feeling of the Stripes. Bottom line, this is a side project that will not likely succeed.N.B. - I saw these guys play live at the 2006 Virgin Fest near Baltimore, MD.....they were disapointing. However, another band that played Virgin Fest, Wolfmother, got the crowd into it and played a hard, driving, and deep set."
2,Less Is Better,"The music is overproduced, the melodies are boring, and the performances seem uninspired. None of the songs are great although some of them are ok.It reminds me of a failed version of what XTC did as The Dukes Of The Stratosphere- talking their love of 60's psychedelic music and wearing their influences unabashedly on their sleeve.If you are expecting anything close to the originality or energy of A White Stripes' album this will be a big let down.P.S.- I had no idea that Jack White could do such a dead-on imitation of Robert Plant (a la Immigrant Song) on the title song."
1,Aptly chosen album art,Yeah they're beaten black and blue cause this is s4!7. I don't have anything against Jack White either; this is just boring. If you would like something that sounds like White Stripes(that's what I was expecting) try the Soledad Brothers.
1,I Hated It,"This has got to be one of the worst albums I have ever listened to in my life. I decided to check this band out because I liked ""Steady As She Goes"", but that is the only good song on this CD. Everything else is just garbage. There just doesn't seem to be any effort put into the songs at all. They all just feel so empty and lifeless A.K.A. Dull And Boring.Thank God I was able to listen to the album with my Napster subscription and didn't make the huge mistake of buying this terrible album.Sorry to those who love this album; I just don't like it."
2,Doesn't Do Emile Male's Work Justice,"This book is composed of excerpts from Emile Male's more weighty tomes on French religious art. Unfortunately, the result is a patchwork of ideas that are not well connected and not clearly explained. A reader interested in Gothic art, for example, would learn more reading Male's more complete ""The Gothic Image: Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century."" ""Gothic Image"" is longer and perhaps more detailed than ""Religious Art from the Twelfth to the Eighteenth Century,"" but ""Gothic Image"" is easier to read because the ideas are presented more completely."
1,Didn't work for me.,I didn't like this product at all. It didn't work for me. It has a very thick consistency and it didn't have any slip. My hair felt dry after I washed the conditioner out. I was not happy that I bought it. I don't know if the reason is that the conditioner states that it is for damaged hair and that wasn't my condition of my hair.
5,AnShu Hayes delivers again,The thing I like best about this series of books is the simple English Mr. Hayes uses to describe the techniques for the average reader to be able to understand and perform them. It is a great introduction into the art for those newly interested as well as reference material for those of us who have been following the art.The fact that Mr. Hayes continues to sell this series for $29 each demonstrates his desire to share his knowledge with the world.
3,"Great while it lasts, but expect it to break","The good news is that this is a great trimmer. Perfect for getting a clean edge on a mustache, or tidying up sideburns, or other such touch-up trims. Cuts fast, clean and the shape makes it very easy to maneuver and see what you're doing.The bad news is that the build quality is below par. My first one lasted about 1 month. Just stopped working even with a fresh battery. Mailed it back to Remington, and they sent me a replacement. That ran for about two months. Died, mailed it back, got another replacement. That one must have been built on a good day, since it lasted nearly six months. Died, mailed it back, and am now on my 4th one.Remington is very quick to replace it - about two weeks each time. They send a brand new unit, and since it is so small, mailing it back to them only costs around a buck.So, if you don't mind going through the replacement routine a few times, this is worth getting. It does work well while it works!"
2,Worked great.... twice.,"I received this trimmer for Christmas 2008. Used a couple of times in January '09. Went to use it again and it was dead. Changed the battery, still dead. A whole two uses! Wow! On the bright side, it did work well those two times."
5,Fabulous Finish,This is the most awesome powder I have ever used! I've tried many different brands of colored powders that look clumpy and unnatural after a couple of hours of wear. I stumbled upon this powder through a sample I received. I am truely impressed with the natural looking finish I get with this powder. It controls shine and sets my foundation better then any other product I have found. It is worth every penny! The large size jar will last a long time. Be sure you invest in a good brush to apply it.
1,Extreme???? Were??,"Were is the Extreme?? No blood, no Classic ECW. I still dont know why the WWE keeps calling ECW, instead of Youg Talent Wrestling or something like that.The only match worth is Edge vs Undertaker, the rest are ok, but NOT Extreme.The ECW is used to lauch new talent for the future WWE, which I think is great, but they should chance the name."
2,More WWE even less ECW,"You call this hardcore? I seen better fighting in a Disney film. The only match that lives up to the event's name was the TLC match for the World's heavyweight championship between Edge & The UnderTaker. The rest were a bad reminder of ECW On Sci-fi. The worst part of this PPV was...there was no ECW World heavyweight champioship match. You think with an event named ""Extreme Rules"" WWE would have a match for the EXTREME CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BELT but no they messed up big time. I give this event a 4 and a half out of 10."
2,"OK, but no bargain and not great","It's OK, somewhat cheap looking, in my view a much better product is available elsewhere(guess where) for less. No return information that I can find. I could not discern a difference between their less and more expensive versions. Wallet seems convenient, but I'm not sure that I can bring myself to give this as a present--too cheap appearing."
2,NOT ENOUGH ROOM,"This is a lovely soft wallet, however when you insert the credit cards the bottom ones overlap the ones before it and makes it inconvenient to get to the others. Leather is nice."
4,Politics of science rather than Iceman,"The book is focused on the politics of science, the fighting among interested parties, and what surrounds academic interests rather than the finding itself, which is rather a background. It is written like a novel, including many irrelevant details of two or more years past, that the Author obviously assumes. It is well written, reads easily and pleasantly, and contains a long bibliography of scarce interest to the general reader. No references to internet websites. Pictures are very poor. Mostly of the scientists and other people involved. They have very little interest, and none in color. Wery few graphics or ilustrations. I would recommend the book if you want to know the hidden story around the iceman and the glory and misery of science. Search the internet if you want to see it. Or do both."
4,The Politics behind the Iceman,"The book is a good read but I expected more. The focus is on the people and the micro politics of academia and the politics beyond and, for my taste, too little on the Iceman and what we can learn from him."
1,Disappointing,"After playing the first Women for Women CD endlessly in my car, I was very disappointed in Women for Women II. Not as much thought went into this one, I think. Song collection was not as stimulating as the first one. If you want motivating songs by strong women, stick to the first Women for Women."
3,Disappointing follow up,"Eager to jump on the sequel bandwagon, the producers of ""Women for Women"" managed to put together a sub-par follow up to its excellent predecessor.Whereas the orignal chose an eclectic mix of songs that songs complimented each other celebrating the empowerment of women, the follow up is all over the map in terms of style and central theme. About the only thing the songs have in common is that they all have a uterus. I found myself hitting the next button constantly. Standouts are the Indigo Girls, Lauren Christy, Sheryl Crow, Jann Arden and Oleta Adams. This compilation had me scratching my head and adopting my movie mantra - just say no to sequels!!If you want awesome music to celebrate woman power, choose the original ""Women for Women"" or another great compilation - ""Women & Songs"" - both are available on Amazon.com."
1,Ugh! Is Bass 16?,"I can't believe a grown man wrote this book. The worse thing about it was him trying to 'get into the minds' of the female characters and failing miserably.The book was childish, BORING, and unbelievably bad. I only finished it because I was trapped on a plane. Terrible. Run away from this book. Run fast."
1,Kinda Lame,"I'm sorry, but this book lacked bite for me. It was dragging from the beginning. I had to force myself to finish the book to see how it all ended. If I could've, I would've returned it."
4,*******What a RIDE*********,"Wonderful and exciting adventure of four women whom decide to do something daring, wild, and outrageous. Truly a great read! Mr. Bass is a wonderful and inspiration writer who does a terrific job of weaving a very detailed and heroic story of 8+ amusing personalities and makes if all come alive. The four women are courageous, the four men romantic, and others who surprisingly complete the puzzle. Bravo!!!! A must read for all who love a fun, exciting roller coaster of a ride. Monte Carlo here I come......"
4,Headhunters,"I absolutly loved this book! It could be a little confusing at times buy over all it was a fantastic book.I couldn't put it down. It has a suprise ending, which you'll have to think about and sort through to understand, but it just leaves you thinking about this book and how good it is!This is a book for people who like witty but romantic books.This book is for people who like books were the characters live life on the edge."
5,definitely her finest hour,"I have been a huge Nina Simone fan for years, but this lovely mix is one of my favorite collections. Her sultry voice and moving lyrics make you want to stay in all day and hit the repeat button!A great addition! Wild is the Wind is a must sample!"
5,A captivating collection for fans and new audiences,"Normally I am not a Nina Simone fan, and I cannot say that I am a music critique. My knowledge of music is limited to my personal appreciation. I am an audiophile and speaker builder, first and foremost. Once in a while, however, there is a CD that captivates me. This is one such item. The intensity and beauty portrayed in these performances is very personal to Nina Simone, in my opinion. The people involved in this selection have captured both her essence and range. Well done Verve. A new gem, one of about ten, in a thousand items I own."
4,I was blown away by the music!,"I have really enjoyed the voice of Nina Simone, but I had only heard a few of her songs. Then I watched the trailer for Revolutionary Road, and I heard the song ""Wild as the Wind,"" and I knew then that I needed to listen to it again and again. I got the album on sale at a Barnes and Noble, and I was shocked to find that another song was on the album, right in the middle of the CD, that wasn't even listed! What a real treat! The production quality sounded a little garbled, but the lyrics and vocals are excellent."
4,1st recording i've heard from Nina,"It is very rare to find a voice as unique as Nina Simone's. After hearing a few songs by her i knew that i had to go out and buy one of her records. Unfortunately, the local music store only had various greatest hits record. I decided on this one because i had heard Duke Ellington's Finest Hour, and thought that this one may be worth checking out. Though I enjoyed almost every song on this album, I do not know if the tracks were chosen wisely, having never heard many of Nina's work before. As far as greatest hits albums go, I like this one. I hope to find more material from Nina, and maybe find a release of one of her original records."
2,Disappointed,"It is a so-so suspense story not particularly well written and some theological flaws. I classify books into three categories, those I like so much I keep but recommend to friends or buy some to give to friends, those I like but don't keep and pass on to others, and those I just toss. This one I tossed."
4,Good Detergent,I like the smell and cleaning of All and having it delivered was great especially when it was free. Wow!
3,THROUGH TIBET TO EVEREST,"The book Through Tibet to Everest, by Captain J.B.L. Noel is a unquie insight on how the first attempts on Everest were carried out and all the difficulties the expedition had. With Captain Noel a member of both the 1922 and 1924 attempts the book is realistic. Unlike recent books such as Jeffrey Archer's , Paths of Glory"".The book also gives one an insight into life in Tibet at the turn of the 19th Century, with the strange traditions and culture.A Good read, if interested in History and Adventure."
5,Easily in the top 10 of the last millenium,"The first US release by this super group. Mike Mainieri - vibes, Michael Brecker - tenor sax, Eddie Gomez - bass, Peter Erskine - drums, Elaine Elias - piano. This is great acoustic jazz that has all the raw energy and power of the best electric jazz. Great compositions are topped by the late (and VERY MUCH missed) keyboard giant Don Grolnick's ""Pools"". Although I recommend all the Steps albums, I think this particular production is extraordinary in that it doesn't rely on heavy multi-tracking or layers of electronica (which the latter productions use brilliantly by the way). It's a very well recorded session of a hot jazz band playing and improvising on wonderful arrangements of great tunes."
5,THE BEST BAND EVER!,"This is ABSOLUTELY one of the BEST albums ever! The album that comes in 1st is the sophomore STEPS album named Steptacular, but for all those who live in the States, this is the CD you're going to get...except with tracks mixed up from both of the albums. I recommend this album for anyone who LOVES bubble gum pop!"
3,Classic Detective Fiction,"Good stuff for a rainy sunday afternoon in the style of Chandler and Hammett. Good characters, well drawn, with nice brisk plot development. Avid dective ficiton readers won't be disappointed."
2,Boring,I got this for my two year old grandson and he is not interested in it and he loves the wiggles.
2,A disappointment,"After reading all the rave reviews on this book, I was looking forward to gaining advice with a new twist and different perspective. I was disappointed. Maybe I've read too many of these kinds of books so there was really nothing new to be learned. I found the advice a little too impersonal and clinical. There were a few good points that I made notes on but on the whole not a real help to me. (I found ""Getting Past Your Breakup"" by Susan Elliott much more impactful for me.) Perhaps since ""30 Days"" was written by two men, that was a factor. All in all I would not recomment it. No one can get over a breakup in 30 days if it was a meaningful relationship."
4,"Good advice in general, but unrealistic","I think this book espouses great, healthy advice in general and will put anyone with a devastated, broken heart on the track to full recovery, but after reading this book and others like it (although I do like that this one is shorter and more practical) I think they all take advantage of the broken-hearted person's desire to get it over with sooner than is humanly possible. These practices take time as much as they take determination, and I don't believe 30 days is realistic for anyone to overcome a broken heart (unless the heartbreak wasn't all that significant to begin with). The authors do make the point in their introduction that 30 Days might not be the magic number for everyone. Surely, though, after reading this book a person will find some relief within 30 days and have good reason to believe the despair will eventually be lifted altogether."
1,Dont buy. Written by men who have no clue about womens emotions,My first clue should have been that it was written by 2 men. The Mars vs Venus between men & women is evident thru out this book. They don't touch on the emotions a women goes thru during a break-up. They want u to believe it can be accomplished in 30 days . Don't waste your money & time reading this.
3,Simple advice will work for some,"It looks like this book is good for many people, and to be sure the authors don't narrow down their audience - this book is good for people who do the breaking, or are broken up with, it isn't all girly so good for guys too.For me it wasn't substantive enough. It didn't really have any examples to back up what the authors said. There is a lot of sensible advice, but I don't need to read a book to be told to take a shower and drink 8 glasses of water a day. Kind of like having your hand held by your dad, and if that is your kind of thing, then perfect.Another book you might like if you are going through a rough time is Transitions by William Bridges - a trusty favourite for most hard situations."
4,Good Book to Guide You...,"My ex dumped me about 23 or 24 days ago. I got this book based on someone who really liked it. For the most part I'm very happy with it. Some of the stuff repeats over and over again, but I must admit I am feeling much better, and the book has definately helped me out. I'm to the point where I mentally have forgiven my ex, and feel comfortable with not ever seeing her again. I think after 30 days I'll be strong enough to make my ex a VERY distant memory. The one thing I want to caution on, is that 30 days is just a guideline, it could take longer for people depending on the situation...."
4,Very very helpful,"This is the first ""self help""-type of book I've read, but it was really really helpful. At a time when everything is a muddled, chaotic mess, this book has a pretty good handle on the process of letting go of lost love. It's a simple little book with four or five pages to slowly go through each day, prompting the reader to ask questions, evaluate life and JUST GET THROUGH the next month. It absolutely worked for me and provided a touchstone that gave me the perspective I needed to learn what is actually happening to my life. I highly recommend it. And you may just surprise yourself to find that recovering your sense of self and your life might be a lot easier than you could have thought possible. Do it. Good luck!"
5,Just hang on a minute...........,"Now just hang on a minute, you bastards. I have just started reading Chapter 19 and you tell me that my ex was not ""the One"". But I told her she was. I clearly remember where we were when I said it. I even wrote it in a letter and sent it to her.And now you tell me she wasn't even close??How, at 59 years old, could I have got it so wrong???Up until now, (in the preceding 18 chapters), you have been right on the money so it could be you are right here too.Read on, MacDuff.........."
4,...it helped...,"I could not read and absorb this until about three months after a harsh break up... but once I was open and ready... passed the shock, denial... this book did help to expedite healing."
4,A Great Book about Frida,"I liked this book alot. It gave great details about her life from the begining to end. I thought that it got a little wordy sometimes, like the author was trying to prove how much she knew. But other than that it was an excellent book."
1,Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo,"I believe the book was new, as advertised. However it must have been sitting on a shelf for quite a while because it was quite yellowed and smelled musty. Poorly written, I only read about 50 pages."
4,A tortured soul,"I very much liked this book (listened on audio.) Though I have never been terribly interested in artists or art, I had seen original murals in Mexico by Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo's husband. I only knew a bit about Frida before I read this and was curious about her life. This book led me to the internet to view the paintings they described of Frida's work(not too helpful to listen to a book like this in retrospect.)Poor woman led a tortured life, full of pain both physically and emotionally if what we glean from this book to be true. She is a very unique, ""colorful"" and compelling woman, whether you like or disapprove of her lifestyle and her work."
3,frieda long story but interesting,"When wanting to learn about FRIEDA, my group decided to read about her. We love to read, but, all of us found this book to be exceptionally long. The pictures referred to were not placed in convenient pages in the book. I sent for the book about her which was based on her pictures instead, much shorter, more convenient as well as the film. Since all of the information is a repetition of the other, I was impressed by the movie, intriqued by the small book of her paintings with explanations and overwhelmed by the original long biography."
1,unhappy,"This product has not arrived, so how can I review it. in fact I wish I could cancel it and save myself some money"
5,Bought for 1999 Chevy Tahoe,"This was what I needed to fix my 4x4 system in my truck. Was half the price on Amazon compared to the local parts store. Took about an hour and a half to install in the freezing cold we had the day it arrived (-12F). Would have taken a lot less time to install on a warm day. Fixed my problem and allowed me to drive through some bad snow up steep driveways, and looking out the window I will need it again today."
5,over and over and over,"One of my favorites!! I buy this again and again. You only need a little, about the size of a pea... apply directly.Not only did i make my own orgasms much stronger, but acted on my husband to make him last much longer.Great stuff :)"
4,functional and minimal,this product was easily assembled and works well. It stores up to 9 bottles of 750ml wine and can handle a few of the 1500ml but do not think it was designed for them. It serves our purposes well and I would reccomend it to anyone who just wanted some storage for a few bottles.
1,Mac Mini,"Great machine very weak Hard Drive. The core duo and Super Combo dvd burner is great. But since the hard drive is so slow 5200rpm, the average is 7200rpm and the faster machines are 15000rpm it is a slow machine in comparsion. I bought it with out knowing and wondered why my machine was crashing all the time... I also added ram 512 isn't very much ram.PROBLEM NUMBER 1...I upgraded the hard dive to a 7200rpm and it runs great. I fixed that problem no more crashing.PROBLEM NUMBER 2...There are constant operating system updates, you know update itunes, updated safari, updated firmware.Will now my Super Combo Disc burner no longer works and it turns out it is a common problem other people are having. I don't know if apple is going to release an update to fix the problem.DON'T BUY A MINI, if you want a mac I suggest a imac, you'll get a great monitor, faster hard drive and more ram, it's worth the extra money!"
2,Prefer the PowerPC version,"I already owned one of the 1.5 Ghz PowerPC version minis, but ""just had to have"" one of the Intel core models. Sadly, It doesn't perform anywhere near the old mini. It crashes (something the old mini has NEVER done), and is sluggish and slow to respond.I do like the fact that is has additional ports and more room for expansion, but it just isn't ready for prime time. Additionally, as most folks know, macs like as much ram as you can give them. Being forced to share ram with the video card is a horrible flaw when working with applications that render video and graphics as the system slows to a crawl"
2,Noisy audio input jack,The Mac mini audio input jack is highly susceptible to picking up 60-cycle hum and other audio noise. Not acceptable.
5,Good for those with all thumbs,"The diagrams were so clear and inviting that I was forced to sit down and start a bracelet pattern. I love to bead and am all thumbs. This makes some projects difficult, but this book seems to have been designed with me in mind. I turned out a lovely bracelet the first time with surprisingly little effort. The beautiful ginko leaves shown in the book are still a bit aways off for me, but with practice I think I can make those too. The photos are terrific. I highly recommend this book for beginners and advanced beaders alike."
2,Materials are too old and not practical....,I hope this book was reviewed before it was published. It has many problems... Over priced and useless for those who want to earn their living in this profession. Don't know what to say...
4,Glad I got this CD.,"I already have CD's of Ms. McRae's early work, and of her later outings. This is the first recording I've picked up of her singing from the mid to late 1950's. What impresses me most is how she sings with great security and an exceptional awareness of the meaning of the lyrics. She is accompanied by backup musicians who are talented enough to be supportive, but not intrusive. The best compliment I can pay is to say that this is one production to which I want to give repeated listening. While a fine restoration job has been done, the overall sound quality falls short of contemporary standards. For Carmen McRae fans this is a truly worthwhile disc. Casual listeners might not be so taken with it."
5,Dickens masterpiece,A number of unforgettable characters make this book a pleasure to read. Dickens's opinion of America is famously represented as young Martin Chuzzlewit and his sidekick Mark Tapley travel to New York and beyond in search of fortune. A must-read.
3,buy hardcover with Dickens.,the print is too small for me.I like that it has an appendix of unfamiliar old references.I also like the illustrations.Sticking with my 1965 New American LIbrary for reading and the Penguin for the other things just mentioned.
4,"Good, but not Dickens' best","If you like Dickens, Martin Chuzzlewit is definitely worth the read. Like virtually everything he wrote, this novel is engaging, emotional, and intensely human. It follows a pattern that is bound to seem familiar to those acquainted with Dickens, and has a very Dickensian happy ending; but then, that is what we love about Dickens. There is still something to be said for virtue, and it satisfies our sense of justice when it wins out in the end. That isn't a very modern sentiment, but it is an undeniably good one. This isn't the first book I would recommend for someone wanting to pick up a little Dickens (Tale of Two Cities, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist would probably all come first), but this is worth the read. I give it four stars only because I think it is second-tier Dickens; but second-tier Dickens is still first-rate."
3,Air Power- Story of the US Air Force,"The Air Power video they advertised and I purchased, is not the one narrated by Walter Cronkite which was done in 1957. This is a later version done in 1999 by Columbia River Entertainment, which I already own. Product quality and condition are fine, it just is improperly advertised.T.C."
5,"PROVES, AGAIN, THAT THE RACE GOES TO THE MOST TALENTED!","The key theme of this work is that the competitive advantage goes to those companies that are best at finding, motivating, and retaining talent to fill critical positions-especially in high technology sectors. The book is filled with good advice on staffing, recruiting, motivating, managing, and retaining people. Adding to its value, Gubman gives many references to what leading companies are doing. Plenty of sound advise and examples make this worthwhile reading. Reviewed by Yvette Borcia, co-founder, Stern & Associates, author of Stern's Sourcefinder: The Master Directory to HR and Business Management Information & Resources, Stern's CyberSpace SourceFinder, and Stern's Compensation and Benefits SourceFinder."
1,Powerbutton stopped working on 10 different units within 6 months,"We purchased 10 sets of these for a set-up. Within 6 months, the power button stopped working (it will no longer stay ""in/on"") on all 10 of them (at first we thought it was just one bad pair). Sound is OK on them but does one no good if they will not stay on. Duct tape is our next solution. We had liked them until the the power issue."
4,Sounds Good!,The speakers do a great job for what they are. You might have to tweak the bass boost a little to get it exactly like you like it. Definitely good for PC speakers. Somewhat heavy duty.
1,Just Wanna Comment 'Bout One Song,"Never heard it. Just wanna comment that ""Heaven Help Me,"" by Deon Estus (produced by George Michael) is one of the best songs I've ever heard from a bass player. Nice lyrics and melody. It should be more accesible than just being on this CD. C'est tout."
1,Heaven part III,"couldn't agree more that the only reason for purchasing this CD is the song ""heaven help me"" by deon estus w/ george michael. i couldn't be more disappointed that this song hasn't been picked up by more labels for some sort of 80's compilation CD"
2,One song truly stands out....,"I originally purchased this CD for a friend who wanted a copy of ""Heaven Help Me"" by Deon Estus. The entire CD is dull in comparison to this one song. ""Heaven Help Me"" is hauntingly beautiful, especially with background vocals from his friend George Michael.No other song truly stands out except this one. Deon Estus' original solo album is now out of print, so if you're a fan of his, I'd get this album!"
4,It's Adequate,"The book looks nice, sturdy, but could have been a little thicker for the price. We gave them to a group of graduating seniors to journal in."
5,Super Aspirin's are the MIRACLE CURE!!!,"I have osteoarthritis in my shoulders and neck and after sitting in one position at the computer, my pain is unbelievable. Or--should I say--WAS unbelievable. I saw this book advertised and was doubtful--after all, there was a ""cure"" for arthritis two years ago that was pure hype. I was fascinated with the many REAL scientific studies--the credibility of the authors, and how Super Aspirins may be proven to stop some cancers and Alzheimer's disease. I got an Rx from my doctor three weeks ago--within 48 hours (that's Celebrex--twice a day), my pain was gone--none. I now sleep with no pain; I arise with no pain. I exercise, ride my bike, jog with my dog. It's truly a miracle. If you have arthritis pain--BUY THIS BOOK. Follow McIlwain's PLAN TO END PAIN. TAKE SUPER ASPIRIN AS directed. It will give you an active life again."
1,Item not received,I never received the item nor was informed that it was not coming. The item was supposed to have been lost in the mail and I have been promised a refund.
2,Sinks way too fast,"Its very very small, and it sinks too fast. It gets trapped into the small spaces of the gravel and most of it is wasted. For a pellet this small, it should float so the fish can actually eat it. The ingredients are great and my fish do like NLS; I just won't buy ""All Purpose"" again."
3,Reissue,"This 2005 Japanese Reissue of jon's solo album of 1997, have a bonus track ""I Talk To Jesus"", and both japanese & english lyrics, this already a sold out album, but still have a japanese version of Destination Anywhere with the Bonus track ""I talk To Jesus"".Note: The 2005 Reissue Includes: Richie Sambora - Stranger in this Town (1991), Undiscovered Soul (1998), Jon Bon Jovi - Blaze of Glory, and NEW JERSEY (1998), all cd's with booklet with Japanese and english Lyrics. Recomended!"
5,Jon goes down a different road...,"I have to admit, I did NOT like this album when I first heard it. I thought it was dull and slow moving. The songs sounded basically all the same at first, and there wasn't a single song that ""popped"" out at me.I put this record away for a couple months, then returned to it. It sounded completely different. I realized that Jon Bon Jovi and Bon Jovi were two different artists. I am a huge Bon Jovi fan, and when I first listened to DA, I was expecting something Bon Jovi-ish. Don't. This record is NOTHING like ANY Bon Jovi albums. Jon expresses himself beautifully in all his songs, using the power of his voice and words to leave you breathless. This is definately different than the loud and wild Jon Bon Jovi we know from Bon Jovi. It's uncanny how he transformed, but it's amazing. This man is truly talented and has a heart of gold."
4,"Interesting Songs, but Weak Vocally","I appreciated what Jon was trying to do on this release (get away from ""Bad Medicine"" type songs I think), but in doing so he undermined what most of us love about him, his voice. The performance isn't poor, just very toned down from what we're used to. If you like to hear the soaring ""Blaze of Glory"" tracks or the heart-wrenching ""Lie to Me"" ballads, you will be somewhat disappointed with ""Destination Anywhere."" However, the songs are very good. ""Janie, Don't You Take Your Love to Town"" is my personal favorite. There is a lot to like on this album, but it is not the typical Jon Bon Jovi singing that we are used to."
5,Unbelievable,"I have at least ten Bonjovi albums which of course are all brilliant, so when I come across this album only a few months ago, I decided to get it and give it a listen. What can I say, if you love Jon, you will love this. It's not just the words, it's the music. I'm sure he helped compose it. It's got a bit of a jazz and grove twist to it. I listen to it every day. This is the first chance I've had to express my feelings, I wish I could tell the band they absolutely rock. I'm a real rock chick, always have been, and I believe the world is a better place because of Bonjovi. There isn't a song that I don't like, and that's the truth. You can condense this for your review, I just had to say what I feel. I truely hope they come this way again soon, it would be real honour and dream come true if I could meet them. I'm sure all the girls say that. Anyway thankyou for allowing me to say my piece.Pammy xxxxxxxxx"
2,"I didn't puke, but I almost fell asleep.","Downer subjects don't require phoned-in, numbly arranged songs -- look at Counting Crows. Once or twice, Jon starts to try to let loose with the amazing vocal instrument he spent years building, but he can't break loose from the sludge of pedestrian arrangements -- a drummer that sounds like a mid-priced machine, backup singers that sound like a sampler. There is no energy or soul to this album -- unless you define soul as ""I am miserable and telling you about it."" For those familiar with the artist, this is like the worst half of 'These Days', only with none of the musicianship of the Bon Jovi band to even begin to carry Jon through. I shoulda bought Richie Sambora's album instead."
3,"Good, But Not Up To Bon Jovi's Usual Strength","I suspect that only real die hard Bon Jovi fans bought this record. If you are not a real Bon Jovi fan, you may do better to sample him with '7800,' 'Slippery When Wet,' or 'New Jersey.' On the other hand, this is not a bad record. Despite the slowness of it, it does have its charm. My favorite Bon Jovi records are '7800,' 'Slippery When Wet,' and 'New Jersey.' But that does not mean nothing else he wrote is worth listening to. After all, do we really know an artist if we only listen to his finest efforts? It is interesting to hear Bon Jovi's attempt at something different. My advice boils down to this: (1) If you are not a Bon Jovi fan, this record can be skipped. (2) If you ARE a Bon Jovi fan, be open to hearing something that may not be one of his better efforts, but is still worth some interest."
2,regretfully... thumbs down,"I found it unfortunate (albeit a natural part of growing up) that Jon found it necessary to so radically alter the rock 'n' roll ""formula"" that carried him through the 80's and early 90's. This album will strike the Bon Jovi purist as a somewhat odd, misplaced effort that does not satisfy the craving for more anthem inspired belt-em-out and sing-till-you-can't-speak style we have grown accustomed to loving. Still, if you are a product of the mid- to late-90's movement toward a stripped down musical genre, this album will wonderfully dovetail Jon's propensity for vocal excellence with the toned-down acoustics of the current age."
4,Good sounds,"The way Jon Bon Jovi style is these days is a little softer not so hard rock, but it is still great music."
2,Eh,"I like him best with the rest of Bon Jovi and his collaborations with Richie Sambora. It's an Ok CD, nothing to write home about."
3,Just Jon,"This album is very different from his usual Bon Jovi style. BUT, it is still Jon. I love to hear him sing no matter what. His voice is absolutely beautiful.He has always had a message in his songs. This one was written for someone he loves, I think.Worth the trip."
1,"mellow,no spunk, i'm sad that bon jovi broke up","they lost it after fame,bon jovi,along with sambora went from action to soap operas,very dull."
1,ABSOLUTLY AWFUL !,"Is this for real? It sounds like John Tesh or Harry Connick Jr.I just got this CD and it put me to sleep. It should be called Destination down the tube.I'm a diehard Bon Jovi fan from New Jersey and I cannot believe he released this tragedy.I love all the CD's from Bon Jovi but this solo by Jon sounds like elevator or nursing home music.And for Richie,Bryan and Tico, please don't let Jon out of your sight again."
1,spare your self,This is one of the worst cds i have ever gotten. Jon's other stuff is great and I'm a big fan but he really is lackin' somthin in this one. Bon Jovi is great but Jon went way off on this one.
1,Well kept secret -- Leave it that way,"As a born-again Bon Jovi fan (last 4 years or so), I was surprised that I had never heard of this CD until recently. When I bought it, however, I realized why I hadn't heard of it. It's, well, pretty dreadful. Why someone who is surrounded on a daily basis by the musical talents of Richie Sambora, Tico Torres and David Bryan would find it necessary to seek out a different band is beyond me."
3,Very Helpful,"Although this book is not state specific it is a resource for those who are a member of a Homeowner's Association for the very first time. It does not provide the ""nuts and bolts"" daily information of an association, however, it does provide a good over-all picture of how a HOA is suppose to function."
3,"Informative, Comprehensive, and Dry","The authors are both lawyers and that comes through in their writings. Although the text is informative and comprehensive, the repetitive language and dusty formality made this a challenging read. This book would be a welcomed addition to any reference libary but it may not be appropriate as the first book a new board member sits down with."
3,Manual as a checklist,"The manual is a good checklist of things to consider. It isheavy on the legal and semilegal procedures of associationboards. It gives some forms, again in the legal area, butis very light in the planning,funding and maintenance areas."
4,Homeowners Association Manual,Being a new member to a Homeowners Board of Directors I needed to know what and how to get things done. This book was my answer.
4,Homeowners Association Manual,"Found information to be enlightening, but am not sure that all the tools they suggest using are valid and accepted in ""the good ole North State"".... Comprehensive.... Polly"
1,don't trust CAI,"The author is a member of the Community Associations Institute, which is the lobbying group for HOA managers and lawyers. They do NOT look out for homeowner rights. HOA's are a cash cow for their members, thus they have every intention of furthering their spread throughout the country. The book glosses over the inherent problems of the private government system for that very reason. That being said, if all board members had to read this before proceeding to wreak havoc on their neighbors, it would be a good thing. Most board members don't know anything and don't bother to learn. HOA's can be very scary places, and you can find yourself trapped in a bad one quite easily."
1,Generic Yadda Yadda Yadda,"This entire book is the equivalent of the prelude in a beginners HOA book. The information in this book would be condensided just enough to make someone seem like they didn't know what they were talking about at a HOA meeting. Be careful after reading this book. Check your state for the laws that apply. Good, basic Corporation not for Profit and Homeowner Association Structure information is all it contains."
3,The Homeowners Association Manual,"This, like nearly all books on Homeowners Associations, is like the judicial arm of the government. It advises how to interpret and conduct ongoing association business. However, such conduct is limited by the homeowner ""contract"" which, unfortunately, is ignored. I wish these types of books would have a first and major chapter that gives example association bylaws and ordinances, that which a homeowner signs and agrees to. It should also contain a list of articles that should be considered in the ""contract"" and proper ways to draft those articles. The old addage ""measure twice, cut once"" should be applied so appropriate contracts are drafted at the beginning so association management would be more manageable."
5,Very important for HOA officers,"I am new to HOA's and was recently elected to be treasurer. Reading this book has given me so much information to do my job. I thought it was so informative, I passed it on to the other officers and now each one of us has our own book, to pass on when we are no longer officers."
4,"Depending on your goal, this book could be just what you want","This book seemed to me to be aimed PRIMARILY at those starting a Homeowners Association - or tweaking one already in place. However, even those who are looking to buy a home could benefit from looking at this, if only to get an idea of the types of rules, regulations and restrictions that Associations can impose on owners.If you are reading this review, odds are that you already have an opinion about Homeowners Associations, either feeling that they promote neighborhood safety and community or that they are overly restrictive and not a good thing.In any case, this book could be helpful, no matter what your viewpoint BEFORE reading it.Some of the featured areas include:Learning what a homeowners association should strive to do, its purpose and function...rules, regulations...how to set up a proper Board of Directors...What rights homeowners have...running meetings...and much, much more."
2,Basic hoa outline,This is a very basic hoa book on how to. The hoa's are varied and complex and this book provide just the tip of how to run and manage an hoa. there needs to more examples of large hoa that have revenue producing amenities.
5,Wedding Peach Season One,This anime was pretty good. I'd give it five stars and two thumbs WAY up! You can check it out on youtube. It's almost identical to Sailor Moon. Mostly because the Person who made Sailor Moon made Wedding Peach too.
1,Was not all there - found 10 blank pages,"The book is very small with a few pictures from victims included. I was upset to find pages 1,4,5,6,8,9,12,13,16,17 missing! The pages were there but were blank...<?>Not a very professional job by Lunchbox Press. Looks like a home-cooked publisher. I bought the book for my wife who can't make much sense out of it due to the missing pages. I hope to get a complele copy or a refund from Amazon or Lunchbox Press soon......Richard C. Anderson"
5,"Dazzling collection of feel-good, bring back memory hits!","Gamble and Huff's beautifully arranged pieces of soulful inspiration and groove! Where does The O'Jays classic ""Love Train"", Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes ""The Love I Lost"", or The Three Degrees ""When Will I See You Again"" take you? A splendid trip for the ears down memory lane! Be there!"
3,Opinion,"I am not a compilations fan, I prefer the original albums like the ""Intruders,"" When We Get Married,"" and ""Cow Boys To Girls."" Compilations and ""Greatest Hits,"" always leave personal favorites out in the cold."
5,Lauren Christy Should Breed!,"With such talent one can only hope Lauren Christy will ""Breed"" thus providing us ever more talent. This is an amazing CD. While I can only wonder why the sudden change in music style (see her preview album) I soon stopped questions Lauren's motives after I listened to the entire album and realized Lauren is offering more than just ear candy, but some brain candy as well. She offers a wide variety of styles in ""Breed"" - from the glam-enlightenment of 'Magazine' to the sad truth of relationship disillusionment of 'Burn' - I was thoroughly impressed with this artist and recommend her to everyone! Thanks, Anna!"
5,"completely different, but still great","i got this cd b/c i heard that lauren had a new one. i love the first and was anxious to get it. i was kind of afraid to listen to it though b/c i heard that it was completely different and i didnt want to be disappointed. finally my roommate told me to listen and im so glad that i did. this cd rocks! it is perfect for when youre in a great mood and equally good for a bad mood. my fave is ""couldve been."" there is no real reason why i like this one, i just love it. when i drive to work i blast it as loud as it can go. another fave is ""magazine"" just b/c it totally defines how far people go to fit in and how detrimental it can be. im so glad that i got this cd and i highly recommend it."
1,Wow ! all 5 stars ? 14 reviwers ? Are they real ?,I almost click to buy this book. It seems good from the mouths of 14 readers. But.... wait ... why all the 14 reviewers wrote their reviews around the same date ? and the same Annie from NYC wrote two 5 stars reviews on Jan 6 & 7 respectively ? Are these reviews really written by real readers ?
1,Nothing new,What is written in this sparse tome does not bode well for the authors future. There is really nothing of note here that is of real insight.
3,(Glass Shatter Sound),"My first beyblade made the base of this EXPLODE!!!!! After one hit too:( Bottom Line: It is too tall to attack, it's shifty base messes up it's other stats, and the base is complicated to build and easy to detinate. THE END"
5,Must get Blade!,"I bought a Wyborg just yesterday with a marksmangrip. Thanks to my mom. It took me 15 mins. to build cause of the base. Wyborg has this base that switches from endurance to attack when its hit. Its like the auto change balancer base. When i first launched it in my stadium, it broke my wolborg 2's attack ring! Now thats power. Wolborg 2's atack ring is preety strong but my wyborg ripped through it. I made up my own attack with wyborg. Its called ""Sea wave attack"". First launch wyborg in the middle of the stadium. Then, let wyborg get hit and when the shaft changes to attack mode, i call out ""Sea wave attack!"" and my wyborg throws my other blade out of the stadium. i have other blades too. Wolborg 2 draciel s dragoon v2 (japanese blade) driger f trygle master dragoon master dranzer master draciel galman dranzer f dranzer s dragoon fighter and dragoon storm. I got my blades from a gift card when my uncle put 40 bucks on it for christmas. Let it rip!!!"
2,Mike's Wyborg Beyblade Review,"When I saw this blade in stores I thought ""Oh, wow. It looks awesome."" I would now like to say that I was sadly mistaken. This is just as good of a beyblade as Michael Jordan is a baseball player (which means [bad]). All it does is switch to attack mode and throw itself into a penalty pocket or switch to endurance mode and falls over. This blade is a waste of time and money."
1,Read This,All I have 2 say is THIS BEYBLADE SUCKS!!!! IT COMES APART TO MUCH!! I Don't have it but my brother does and it SUCKS!!!! Thank you.
4,PURPLE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi! I'm Rob I've jest turned 12 and Ilive in merry old England and I bought this blade a few months ago, it took awhile to put together but when I did it was awsome! Who gives a damn f it's purple?The blade has two modes, attack and endurance mode,they really do help you win battles but if you look at other blades you see how chunky it is.This blade is good so get it if you want.p.s if you live in England have you noticed how no one uses beyblades? I was told by my friend they are babyish."
3,Wyborg-A complex and annoying blade.,"Ian.Wyborg.Allies in battle for the Demolition Boys in the anime.Wybor seems so awesome there but in reality he is to hard to build and use, just making the blade base makes you want to scream. Then you have to figure out which way to have him endurance or attack so when he switches he'll stand a chance, personnally he could be a 4.5 if you master him and he's for experts, begginers I go with Driger S or F."
3,"Flimsy, Cheap, Still a Crowd Pleaser","I bought this Ghostbuster costume last minute, but it still made my Halloween weekend. I went to three different parties Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and everywhere I went, everyone loved the costume. Still, I wished I had taken the time to assemble an actual Ghostbuster costume. It would have been more fun, more accurate, and Amazon.com gave me plenty of recommendations on what to buy for cheap (except the proton pack; a replica would have been pricey no matter what).Long johns or sweats underneath are recommended for those in cold areas during Halloween. If you don't have an air pump or a bike pump for the backpack, don't bother. Otherwise, go for it. A cheap, quick substitute for a replica costume. By the way, you'll need to print out your own color badges (I used mailing labels trimmed down), and the more you can add on your own, the better (a tool pouch, a head light, rubber gloves, etc.). Bustin' will make you feel good, regardless of your budget."
2,Cheap product,"The logo on my sleeve hasn't been colored properly, the colors aren't aligned with the outline of the ghost. The straps on the pack are barely usable and the belt doesn't really work like it should. You aren't really able to hold the gun like you see in the picture, and the pack is deflates pretty quickly. The actual jumpsuit is decent but it's a little big.This product will due for this Halloween, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends."
2,Cheap and flimsy,Should be considered strictly a one-use item. I tossed mine after wearing it and don't regret doing so at all
4,Girl in a guy's costume.,"I didn't want to be scantily clad in the women's version, so I got the men's costume. It's big and hugs the hips on a female, but with a few alterations, it's good to go. The backpack is cute. Mine came with a hole in it along the seam, but they do send you a patch kit, so that fixed it right up. You can jazz this up with your own additions- I wore elbow pads and a name tag."
2,Better have low expectations to be happy,Ghost busters suit was just fine. Worked great but the back back never would blow up and hold air. Gun is a joke. The gun needs alot of redesigning. This costume is good for kids but for adult better have backup plan for back pack and gun..suit no problem. Wore mine on halloween night with my kid so it served its purpose.
2,Get ready to blow on that inflatable backpack over and over and over....,"Out of 4 of these I ordered, 3 of the inflatables were damaged. I had to be on it all night so it wouldn't look deflated... Definitely a big hassle and headache.Sizing was fine, a little baggy for my taste (5'6 140 pounds) but with the backpack strapped on it looked better. Don't get me wrong, people loved the costume, a BIG hit, but after paying for this the least I could hope for was a non deflating backpack."
5,Who ya gonna call?,"I'm 6'0"" and about 205, and the costume fit perfectly! I even won ""Best Costume"" at work. The only concern that I would have is that the backpack needed to be re-blown every 2 hours or so. Other than that, it's awesome!"
1,Very cheap quality,All inflatable packs I ordered had holes in them so we tried to patch them up but to no avail. We were quite disappointed as $30 a costume isn't cheap and what we received was only $5 quality.
1,Quite a disappointment this costume,"The costume was a major disappointment - did not fit me one bit, I looked like a funny blob than a Ghostbuster. It was really not what I expected. The backpack and gun were poor quality plastic. Overall it did not look anything like the display pic."
2,great idea but should be by sizes,"I thought the idea was great. I had to return this because I am 5ft 6 in and it was HUGE!!! The crotch was literally all the way down by my knees! The backpack, although a great idea was very hard to keep in place. I would not recommend if you are around my height. This is made for maybe a taller person but not a big person. I am average and could barely squeeze in the upper part. Needless to say I had to return this because it was just too big and uncomfortable. The item I got was just not what I expected. I wish these would come in sizes instead of one size fits all, I think it would have worked had it been by sizes. I was upset I had to return it and then run out to look for a costume here in town for my kids Halloween carnival. Needless to say I am still waiting for a refund and no word on that yet. Disappointing :("
1,The only game in town,Over the past few years I have come to find out that Rubies produces a lot of garbage. This costume was no exception. The jumpsuit quickly came apart under both arms within a few minutes of normal wear. The inflatible gun had a leak so it could not be used. I would be hesitant to purchase anything else made by these jokers. Garbage!
2,Poor quality. Avoid.,"We bought 2 of these. Both fit differently even though they were the same size. Both backpacks leaked air. Both ""Lasers"" were poorly made and required a small piece of cardboard (included) to be added to them to keep their circular shape. No instructions so was difficult to understand the cardboard piece (We just used a paper towel roll to add body and circular appearence). One of the back packs primary straps broke. The costume did look ok but disappointed in the quality. If you purchase it be prepared that its a 1-time use. I'll avoid this manufacturer moving forward. Gave 2 stars for appearance and price was a little better than competitors."
4,Back pack was great for this custume.,I just needed the backpack and it worked out just great for an evening out at costume parties. I had a wonderful time with this product. thank you.
1,cheap piece of garbage,This costume didn't live up to the positive reviews. It was very cheap and one of the plastic components appeared ripped off completely. I returned it and purchased a similar priced costume that was 100x more quality for the moneyCalifornia Costume Men's Adult-Hercules.
2,very poor quality,The suit itself was very low quality material and very thin. We blew the backpack up and it would not hold air over an hour. Our friend also bought one as they were used as costumes in a talent show and her's did the same thing. Not reccomended if you plan on using the backpack as it never held air.
4,Latin Lounge Lizards,"There is more to latin lounge than Herb Alpert and the south of the border sound. The latin influence from various parts of South America -- especially Brazil -- was huge in the 50's and 60's because of its creative styling, exotic beat(s)and the many dance crazes it spawned (Mambo, Rumba, Cha-Cha, etc). This CD features two of the biggest hits of the era; The Girl from Ipanema and Guantanamera. Both are fondly and easily recollected, but this retrospective also introduces Xavier Cugat and Esquivel to the listener, along with Sergio Mendes and the Baja Marimba Band. The last two bands vied with senior Alpert for popularity in the mid-60's."
2,More Biography than Music,"This dvd is banal and irrelevant- which is something Gram's music never was.If you enjoy ""behind the music""-style biographies, then you'll enjoy this dvd. I don't, as I think the music is more important than the standard rock n roll lifestyle (why is Gram's story any more interesting in this regard than that of Mick Jagger, Jim Morrison, Sid Vicious, Led Zeppelin, etc). Little is mentioned about how Gram tried to meld rock, country, soul (never mentioned!), and gospel, what effect this had on rock and country, who his musical antecedents and followers were, and so on. The actual music on the albums is barely talked about. It's all about his life and not about his music. If that's your bag, buy this. If not, stay away from this disappointing, pedestrian dvd that completely misses the point.ps- The few moments of archival footage are chopped up with people talking over them- never do we get to see anything close to a complete song."
2,Gram Parsons - The E True Hollywood Story,"Of course, Gram Parsons is a major influence on modern American music, but you wouldn't know it from this lurid and sensational documentary. As Emmylou Harris remarks in this DVD, ""People should remember Gram by his music, not the way he died."" Or the way he lived, I would add.There is little about Gram's music on here, which is very frustrating. Chris Hillman makes a few remarks about Gram's songs, and they show short clips from the Flying Burrito Brothers videos. Especially frustrating was that they showed more of the Eagles ""Take It Easy"" than of any of the Burritos' videos. Ugh, the Eagles.Another problem with this documentary is that there are only the interviews - there is no narrative of any kind, even though it claims to have been ""written"" by Sid Griffin and the director. This makes for a disjointed film. Anyway, one good thing came from watching this - I've been listening to Gram's music a lot lately, since so little of it is present in the DVD."
5,Good table cover,"Stays on in high winds. Fits like a glove, easy on and off, well made cover, Looks nice. Very happy with this item."
5,Rock fans of any kind can't be disappointed here!!!!!,"This is the only Crüe album without Vince Neil on vocals. No disrespect to Vince, he's really great, but singer John Corabi is deeper-voiced, and that's part of what makes this album so unique. He adds a little more anger and spirit to the sound. It is also an extremely well produced album (by Bob Rock). The sound is incredibly powerful. The riffs have a lot of depth, very Sabbath-like, in fact, Mick Mars never sounded better. But the best part is Tommy Lee's drumming. He has here one of the greatest drumming sound ever recorded in rock and roll history. And he's a kick*ss drummer... Violent, agressive, groovy, wild... he's the man. He's not very technical, like, for example, Neil Peart (Rush), but he is soooooo entertaining! The songs are pretty well crafted, certainly not as catchy as the Dr. Feelgood-era songs were, but more serious and mean. You just never mess with Nikki Sixx... A surprisingly great rock album."
4,It was changing times for metal .,"There's no doubt the early stuff was great , but when this album was recorded Hair bands were dieing & metal was in for a minute before grunge ruined music now everything is tecno crapp & no solo's . This music is pretty good , pepole cried they wanted Vince back . This cd is better than anything scince Vince is back . If everybody would have given them a chance who know's what might have came out . The real talent of crue was the combo of Tommy Lee & Nikki Sixx's music."
3,Pretty good,"I actually think that this singer is better than Vince. I know that is most likely an unpopular opinion, but there it is. But on the other hand, I think that the band as a whole wrote better songs more consistantly on other albums."
4,Great album! But the band should have changed their name during Corabi era...,"As a big Motley Crue and Vince Neil fan I kind of found this album a bit sacrilegious. But I have to admit it is a damn good album. In essence, perhaps the temporary split between Vince and the Crue was a good thing being that Vince's solo albums were tremendous and I guess that inspired Motley to turn up the power for their own album. Sadly, I traded this album in quite a few years ago. The funny thing is, if it was under a different name, I don't think I would have. It's just that no one replaces Vince in Motley Crue!!"
5,What a shame...,"This is album kicks ass...This IS the best album Crue has released...Corabi adds an element to Crue that is evident...His voice is raw and incredible...It is a shame that Crue fans didn't give Corabi a chance...The Crue should have stuck him and kept him as their vocalist...Van Halen fans also hated Sammy at first but look where he took them...Bigger than ever...Crue could have gone in a totally new hard ass direction, but they dropped the ball...Too bad... This album is their best ...I am not discounting Vince Neil at all..I like the stuff he did with Crue, but let's face it, let's be honest...This kicks the ass of anything the Crue has put past, present, and probably future...BELIEVE IT!!!!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST ROCK ALBUMS OF THE NINETIES,"This was Motley Crue's best album. Corabi's contribution was so powerful, he sounded like he'd been with the band for years. Everyone was at the peak of their game, as if they had something to prove. At a time when 80s metal acts were struggling, Motley Crue delivered. If-- like me-- you thought Crue's chief contribution to the story of rock was a great autobiography, listen to this album and think again."
1,"""With xylitol?"" That's misleading labeling...","There are a lot of reported benefits to xylitol, but Trident is just using it as a marketing gimmick here. The ingredients list for this gum starts out like this: sorbitol, maltitol, gum base, mannitol, xylitol... That's right, xylitol is the fifth ingredient, and the fourth sugar alcohol!If you do a little searching on the internet, you'll come across a number of doctors and dentists who have said that this gum has too little xylitol to have any practical effect. For people who don't read labels closely, this might also lead them to think that this gum is actually sweetened with xylitol (which causes fewer digestive problems than sorbitol and maltitol).The bottom line is that they've added a few milligrams of xylitol so that they can pretend that this gum is healthier and thus charge more."
1,Xylitol kills dogs (it almost killed mine),"I understand the value of Xylitol for dental care, but please, do NOT keep this product around if you have dogs. I have a $1500 vet bill from saving my dog, who pilfered and ingested a full pack of Trident gum with Xylitol. Use Trident White instead - it's Xylitol-free."
4,I like Astrud,"I love Astrud's voice. In response to:ipanema? written on March 23,2004-The guy sings the song in Portuguese in the beginning of the song. Astrud comes in after that and sings the song in English. Amazon should have linked the sample on Astrud's part."
4,Great CD,Great CD. I love the Getz and Gilberto CD with Girl from Ipanema and this is very much like that!
3,Slightly disappointed,"When I bought this I thought it was going to be a vinyl record because thats what I put in the search engine. When I saw it I bought the ""record"" right away stoked because I love Bossa Nova and I could add this to my expanding vinyl collection. It came in the mail today....not a record but a cd. I'm not horribly heart broken over it but I am pretty disappointed. Very happy though with the fast processing and shipping, and the condition of the cd. Can't wait to listen to it :)"
2,THE GUY????,"""The Guy"" who sings in Portugese on Girl From Ipanema happens to be one of the featured artists on the original recording. His name is also Gilberto. Joao Gilberto. Astrud's husband then. He is a legend. I agree with the comments about nastiness but understand the frustration somewhat. If you don't know the history of the lady or the genre then it's hard to take the seemingly 'la-de-da' reviews for her with any weight. I think it's great that folks come to Brazilian music any way they can. I suspect the Brazilian gentleman meant that her voice is ""generally despised"", not her as a human being. I could be wrong though."
2,Niggly...Negley...I wish I'd never bothered,"Last response, promise. ""Smacks of racism""? I simply asked if Brazilians shared my point of view - Astrud IS a Brazilian, and Brazilians have varying opinions of her talent. No, I am not using a review venue as a chat room - I was responding to (like your ""review"") a personal attack. I did not start the rudeness. Yes, I am an audio engineer - no, I do not ""claim to know everything"". If you read my ORIGINAL review, you will see that I have an opinion that I expressed politely. Only after I was attacked personally (twice now) did I go any further. Such silliness!!"
1,CENCORSHIP AND PERSONAL ATTACKS...,"I simply do not care anymore about offending people who attack any reviewer by name - and Amazon is now choosing to censor votes. If someone attacks me by name, I am going to respond...I don't care if it is 'chat-room' style or not. The rant from Canada is not a review, and ""the reviewer"" picked a phrase out of context to vomit over. Saying my name incorrectly over and over again, without any real review purpose seems to be OK by Amazon standards, but my votes for Mr. Rossati continue to go uncounted. This will be my last review of any kind under those kind of rules. I'll say now what I should have said originally - Astrud sucks - now count up the votes, Amazon"
2,"Se ve fino, pareciera funcionar pero da problemas","Cuando lo recibí me parecia que era más de lo que esperaba por su acabado fino de estilo lapicero y su durable exterior plateado. Lo compré como regalo y me parecio que funcionaba, pero a mi novia nunca le funcionó. Cuando ella intenta copiar varias carpetas en la llave, las mismas se copian vacias y pierdes la información, traté de formatear como me recomendaron pero el problema persiste. Al menos el lapicero funciona. Ahora creo que mejor hubiera comprado un disco externo."
2,Comes up short,"At the risk of going against the grain here - I missed the magic in this one. On the plus side, the plot line is an interesting one - i.e., the method used to extort money from Las Vegas casinos - and the author has a keen understanding of the workings and history of said place. Unfortunately the story itself doesn't flow and the characters, (as well as their development), were to me flat, wooden and very predictable. All of it reminding me of `70's TV show. Can't recommend this one."
4,"A really freaky book, but somehow satisfying","I just finished reading this book, and I really thought that it was a great look on stalkers. Simone really has been through too much to deserve a blackmail threat. It really gets to her with the bricklayer/blackmailer line. This book also explores who you really are. Are you someone who you were twenty years ago, or are you the person living today? If you want to have a really scary read, read it on a dark night all alone."
4,An exploration,"Dunmore does more than tell a story, she shares her outlook on life and how it changes, how we change, which isn't such a bad thing. The uneventful side of the novel, the descriptions of the mundane and ordinary life were nearly poetic, and remain that way throughout for all other characters, apart from the protagonist and her old lover. We have all had times in our lives where on the surface everything seem completely normal, and no-one realises the tremendous trauma and changes we are undergoing beneath the facade, neither during or after, not even those closest to us. Dunmore captures this superbly. This is not a story for its own sake, it's a philosophy, an allegory, an exploration of that idea. You can never go back."
3,Sadly disappointing,"I've just finished reading this book and found it to be disappointing. The blackmail theme is interesting and well developed. You certainly feel involved in the complicated life of Simone and her family who are struggling to hold it all together during tough times...but where was the plot heading? Not to spoil the ending for other readers but I found it didn't warrant the build-up. Overall, I thought it was an average book and I'm not sure that I would recommend it."
4,Surprisingly interesting,"This book was a fast read. Well written, easy to go back and forth between the past and present. It seems far fetched but I like to keep an open mind, stranger things have happened. I really felt sad for Kate, she seemed to have led a very a sad lonely life."
5,lowe lodine diet,very intersting book I love it it is easy and perfect for every one recomanded book specially for people with low lodine diet
3,Helpful but not exactly medical...listen to your Dr. or go see a dietician.,"I purchased this cookbook to complete a LID after two surgeries and before RAI for Follicular thyroid cancer. It has great ideas but, my Dr.'s instructions were much stricter and contrary to the author's claims, not antiquated or wrong. My Cancer clinic is in the top 5 in the nation continually and they still follow the more rigid LID (i.e. no egg whites, no granulated sugar, etc.). My Dr. didn't appreciate the book as it touted a ""specialist"" telling the reader that the cookbook is the real authority, the most up to date, not your personal physician. I took some helpful tips from this book but was limited as most of her ""solutions"" involve foods I was not permitted to have. Toward the end of the diet I saw my hospital's dietician, that was the most helpful thing I did!"
3,Plymouth voyager 1993-1994,"The book has good information, but it is not as complete as it needs to be. We need more information on the timing proceedure."
2,"Neat DVD player, but has problems","It looks very cool and video/sound quality is good, but I found three problems and had to return it for a refund:1. I fully charged the battery and left it in the box for 1.5 days. I then connected it to the player and nothing -- it won't even turn on. I had to connect the power adapter to play. I then managed to charge it a little to get some play time, but this is ridiculous.2. During operation, the DVD makes sound similiar to a loose ball bearing.3. When volume is set to high, some odd (squeaking/squaling) sound appears."
3,It's okay for the price,"I knew before I bought it what others had written, but I didn't want to spend a lot. The problem I have encountered is the DVD movie will just stop for no reason. It keeps happening."
4,Great player for baby/toddler,My toddler abuses this player and after 6 month it still plays all types of DVDs.Actually having no controls on the player is great under the circumstances.We use it mostly at home or in the car without battery.
1,Misleading Title,"If you are a christian looking for information on how to manage or spend your money, then this book is not for you. Nowhere in this book does it say that the author is even a christian! In the foreward the author states that he wrote this book from a financial planning perspective - not a theological one. He simply took a few quotes from the bible, then precedes to devote the majority of his book on investing money. If you really want to know what God says about money, I would suggest reading books by Larry Burkett."
3,Free SF Reader,"Across the backdrop of the French Revolution, a man falls foul of the authorities because of his politics. Going on the run, he encounters some actors, leading him to take up the role of Scaramouche, a clown type rogue character.Eventually, he settles in at a fencing academy, working for a master. Taking over after his death he puts his sword skills to good use."
5,afforded the chance to again enjoy a classic,"I first read this book 25 years ago, and the author's style and wit proved a veritable knockout punch, inspiring me to seek out four more of his novels, and equally peruse each of them."
3,Dated,"A historical romance with a mocking tone, but badly dated. Not as good as Sabatini's Captain Blood."
3,Try before you buy,"This first volume of the latest Rush compilation leans a little too heavily on the very early material with an unnecessary three tracks from the second album 'Fly By Night'. Horribly dated and lumpen it is too with some astoundingly awful lyrics.Things would pick up by 2112, as would sales, but it is not until their fifth album 'A Farewell To Kings' that they finally began to hit all the right notes, with better tunes and a cleaner, more open production.Their constant chord changes and shifts in rhythm could become tiresome but when things all come together, as on La Villa Strangiato and Xanadu - still their finest moment - it can be a real treat.The gradual introduction of keyboards brought colour and variety to their sound, and they even manage a hit with the almost hummable 'Spirit of the Radio'. On the whole, though, this should be approached with caution and searching out two or three of the original albums may be a better option."
3,"Some good ones, some bad also","I am not a great fan from the early years, I prefer what the band has become after this period. Even so, there is some great stuff on this cd.There is 8 tracks out of 14 that I really like, here they are :Spirit of Radio, The Trees, Freewill, Xanadu, Closer to the heart,2112 Overture, The temple of Syrinx and finally, La Villa Strangiato.The other track, most of them from 1974-1975 are less attractive to me.Overall, it is a good cd but not a great one."
4,Good Bit Set -- A Little Soft Maybe,"These are good bit set for working with hand tools.If you are going to use them on an irregular basis around your jeep for common repairs and installations they will be fine.They're not a good choice for ""daily driver"" type tools the metal is just too soft to stand up to constant abuse."
3,Sailor Moon Rocks but this book dosen't,"Sailor Moon rocks, but this dosen't. Sailor Moon is cool, esplisry the manga(comix books), if you are a yunger kid you probley don't the manga; then this books good for you. If you think the manga is cool don't buy this book, it's cinda borring."
3,I admitt,In the begging it is alittle I gues I agree with the first person but I don't know how to read japanese (sorry if spelled wrong) names I don't know how the are pronosed and I did like it and all oh.... You have to at least see a movie before ya read it or it will through you off track by far but It does remind you of those eposodes and keeps your mind going
2,"This book is evil,you should avoid it like the plague!!","There should be a warning on this that says ""For DiC-heads only."" This isn't even Sailormoon!!! Jeez, why did they have to ruin Usagi by making her some brand-name fashion schmitz! (don't ask me what a schmitz is) Why!Why!!! I say that all moonies should boycott this book(but then my 5th grade sister would kill me, cuz she likes it, and plans on collecting them all!! needless to say, she's not nearly as obsessed as I am.^^) Newayz, you'll only like this book if you're big n2 American popculture and read YM (and this doesn't describe any moonies I know..) So don't waste your money!!"
1,I'm sorry but this is a sorry excuse for anyone...,I don't mean to be nasty but this book is one of the worst I've ever read! I cannot stress this more: too americanized. It was made Japanese and was meant to remain so. The mangas are much better and I STRONGLY advise that you stick to them instead...
3,"Too Americanized, but still fairly good.","It's Sailor Moon, yes, so I bought it. It's too Americanized. Idon't like the usage of brand names, etc, it doesn't even sound likeit's set in Japan! But the ONLY reason~ and I mean the ONLY reason~ I would recommend it is because it covers episodes that the American dub (DiC~ Dub It Crappy) doesn't. And unfortunately, subtitled versions of things that have already been ruined by DiC are VERY difficult to find ..."
1,Seya Muun tops Sailormoon,"UGH! I agree with the other otaku who wrote reviews~~this book is way,way too Americanized! Icckkk. Anime is an art form,not a thing to be messed with,in my opinion. But DiC and Mixx and all the American Sailor Moon distributors have to do this stuff. You have to think about this,will majority of 9,10 year old American girls know anything about okonomiyaki or manga or the names of Japanese pop groups? Think about how many Americans don't *period*! So they have to put things in the books & stuff that that Americans can relate to if they want the series to be successful. Okay,I'll shut up and leave now...^_^;;"
4,sailormoon a scout is born the movie,personally i think that this is a good book or movie for people who have probably never heard of anime. I think sailor moon is a hit and it has a cute plot:) Unfortunantly it isn't a thing like the original so i think that it isn't good to read the original and then this you get too cofused or vise versa i saw the American made tv show then read Naoko Takuchi's version i learned Usagi or Bunny or whatever her name was as serena and reading that really messed up what was going on but it was a great book!
3,Sailor Moon rules!! :),"The 'Power of Love' is not a very riveting book. It lacks description, makes Serena sound like she's from America, and is pretty much just a summary of all the epoisodes. Serena also acts like such a big prep in this book too! But for some reason, I enjoyed this book (not greatly, but fairly enough! ^_^)I suggest getting another book!!"
2,Too Americanized,"This book was NOT Sailormoon. Yes, it IS ""Sailormoon"" and not ""Sailor Moon."" This book is waaaaay too Americanized. They use English names for Usagi's (or Serena, ugh)classmates, use brand names, and talk about American bands. Not that I don't like the Backstreet Boys! The point is, Sailormoon is Japanese, that's the way it was made. I don't think they mention Tokyo once in this book.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I thought the story itself was well written. But Molly ""Brown""! They completely ruined the beauty of Sailormoon. It's Japanese! They talked nothing about Japanese food or cultures in this book. It's dull reading too. If you happen to be one who likes the ""dub"" and doesn't care about the original, get this book. But if you REALLY know what Sailormoon is or want to know, DON'T read this book. Watch the original anime and read the manga (if you can, with all those mistakes Mixx makes! That's what editors are for, jeez)."
5,IT was great,This is one of the best sailor moon books I'be have read it is alot easyer to get then the comics I find it very funny and exiting. I can't wait to get mercury rising comes out.
4,She loved it!,"My daughter read the book as soon as it came in and finished it in one day. All I can say is bring on more Sailor Moon books, so she can continue reading them."
5,A Mother's heart,"In Fight like a Girl, Lisa Bevere answers every question I had about being a woman in the church and combats the lies that I have embraced. She shares from the depths of a mother's heart with a true love for her daughters as she calls them to a higher standard of feminity."
4,Excellent read!,I love this book and how it's changing my life. I don't relate to everything in it but I can see me in most all of it.
1,I'm Not Getting It,"I'm into week 7 and not getting it or enjoying it. Seems more like the author's interpretation of the Word rather than the Word. This isn't a Bible study. What's this business about ""hating girls"" and ""hating being a girl""? Odd concept to me.I'm pondering not finishing it. I wish my ladies group had offered more choices. If I continue and I finally get it, I'll come back and edit my comment."
2,book review,This book was purchased for my daughter who is 17 years old and she enjoyed it tremendously. She even read passages to me and we talked about various subjects brought up in the book.
1,Ricoh Ink cartridge,"The cartridge worked for 2 days, then the printer reported I was out of ink. I replaced the cartridge with another one, and the printer works fine. It seems the cartridge I received from Amazon was dried out."
3,Rocking Soundtrack,"This soundtrack ofTales From The Crypt Presents - Bordello Of Bloodlacks the scoreTales From The Crypt: Bordello Of Blood - Original Motion Picture Scorebut features a variety of rock songs of various styles. Anthrax provides the eponymous song ""Bordello of Blood,"" a macabre metal theme. The songs that really stand out are the classics ""Jailbreak"" by Thin Lizzy and ""All Right Now"" by Free. Thrilling and adventurous, these songs fit with the biker bar scenes in the film and are very entertaining. The glam rock anthem ""Ballroom Blitz"" by Sweet is very fun as well. Other songs by artists Scorpions, Redd Kross and Herd, among others, are featured."
4,If you like anecdotes,"this is more about the gathering of anecdotes from people he came across in his show business life and less about his own story. still, an interesting read."
4,"About 2,000 Laughs","Great collection of wonderful stories of the old Hollywood crowd. Glad Randall captured them all in this nice, neat little book that is nice to have on your bookstand (or bathroom) to browse at your leisure and laugh, laugh, laugh. The Groucho stories alone are worth the read (I go for the laughs...)."
2,Dull Book Full of Old Stories That Have Little to Do With the Author!,"This boring book has ancient show business stories which, for the most part, have nothing to do with Tony Randall! If you are expecting insights into his movies or TV shows, you won't find it here. Instead he goes back--as far back as the early 1900s--to tell supposedly funny stories about the theatre and movies. Most of the stories are second-hand and he admits that many are possibly not true! He also tells some dirty jokes and shows very little class. A major disappointment, not what you'd expect from Tony Randall."
4,Some of his best ever,"The Best of Beck is an abridged account of Jeff Beck. It covers his entire career after he left the Yardbirds.Many of his best songs are included such as, The Pump, People Get Ready with Rod Stewart, Freeway Jam from Blow by Blow.Where were You from Guitar Shop is also included and one of his best ever. You also get Going Down from the second version of the Jeff Beck Group.Goodbye Pork Pie Hat from Blue Wind is also included.Jeff Beck has numerous other songs that are not included on this album.If you want the real deal get Beckology.Beckology is much more extensive and includes his best songs from the Yardbird days.There is nothing wrong with this album, its just that there is so much more that is not included.If you want the Best of Beck in a nutshell then this is for you."
1,No sound...,"I realize this isn't a part of an audio language study course, but for crying out loud...how is one supposed to pronounce a letter without even the written phonetic pronuciation in the book? You know...I would like to have seen this as an example at least....a sounds like the A in Jack....at least! Or G as in glee without the L...Don't buy it unless you know all the low, medium and high level tones and the alphabet.My husband is Nigerian and he said it would be impossible to learn Yoruba from just a text, especially this text without the audio.Looks like a book one could self-teach Yoruba but without audio it is a useless book."
4,You have to had it if you want to learn yoruba language,"This is the best book to teach yoruba to some one who understand english. The book is clear, didactic, inteligent and progressive. I'm learning yoruba for 4 years in others books. But, this book is really good."
3,Balanced.,"This is the story of a very interesting life. A good soldier and a fine man, Albert Sidney Johnston served in the background for so long that history questions his ability to rise to the top.Adept at politics and administration, his leadership remains questioned despite involvement in the Black Hawk Indian War in Illinois, the protection of the early Texas Republic and frontier, the War with Mexico, the Mormon Campaign, and the stability of pre Civil War California.Killed at Shiloh, the first top Confederate commander to die during the war, his death leaves the question of an unfulfilled life and thoughts of what might have been. His involvement in so many of the key areas associated with the early stages of this nation's Manifest Destiny, his life is an important one, one that impacts the long procession of events that lead up to the Civil War.He is a person worth knowing about."
5,If you're a teacher or librarian - buy this book!,"This concise practical book on assessment is a must have resource for every teacher, and especially the teacher/librarian. The purpose, essential elements, and all of the methods of assessment are discussed with a plethora of examples. This valuable book should be used in all credentialing programs. Well worth the money - and I can't say that about many ""teacher"" books."
5,"Meddling, merriment, murder and mayhem at the Met","Paul had to do a lot of research to put this delightful story together and she has done a superb job of portraying historic opera stars in a fictional situation. Geraldine Ferrar is the heroine; Enrico Caruso and Arturo Toscanino share the action with fictional characters in this romp through murder at the Metropolitan Opera.Phillippe Duchon is an annoying, egotistical personality and everyone at the Met has just about had all they can take of him. Suddenly someone replaces his throat spray with ammonia. His vocal chords and his life are finished.""Rico"" Caruso is hard on the trail of the killer but Police Lt. O'Halloran of the NYPD threatens to lock him up if he doesn't quit meddling. Geraldine Ferrar takes over for Rico and the fearless and gorgeous diva throws caution to the wind to find the killer.This is lightweight entertainment, sheer delight with every turn of the page. Prepare to laugh out loud -- you'll dread finishing it."
3,Decent book with good info; not geared towards pet goat owners,"We are interested in keeping a pair or so of pet goats, and purchased this book at a Tractor Supply Co. in Virginia. It caught our attention because of how thick and detailed it was and because we had read and enjoyed a few other Storey guides (llamas and chickens). It did contain good, useful information on some things, but we were appalled by some of the sections, such as the one on breeding that reccomended killing billy kids at birth, and suggested drowning as a good method. As pet owners, this information was offensive to us, but I do understand the need to cull if you are raising dairy goats as a living.So in essence, good info, but some parts will seem harsh, cold and difficult to stomach if you approach goat ownership from a pet-owners stand point."
4,great book,This book told me a lot about raising goats. I learned more than I thought I would. Now I can start a goat farm with confidence. Thank you.
2,Poor choice,"Story's guides claim to introduce animal care in ""harmony with nature"". This book promotes more of a home version of factory farming. With suggestions like penning your animals up instead of allowing them to graze on pasture and one way of disposing of unwanted buck kids is to ""drowned them in a bucket of water"". I hardly see how this is in Story's ""theme"" of harmony with nature. JD Belanger's eliteist attitude is also very annoying. Also to contradict his rants, woven wire works fine, you can keep a buck with your does, its cheaper, easier, and BETTER to put your goats on pasture (if avaliable). And its OK to sell an undesireable goat to someone for a pet as opposed to destroying it as he suggests. I give it two stars only for recipies, short info about diseases, and because its about goats."
3,In a state of limbo,"I have no experience raising goats per se, but it seems like there must be more to it, like some things have been left out. I have read this book and feel like I need more information. I think this book is easy to read and understand, but I found some of the author's tone to be of an alarmist's nature. I was left afraid that goats are very fragile and run a good risk of getting every disease in the book. That isn't very encouraging. I cannot really apply the advice given as I do not have goats yet, I am in the research stage, so I cannot make comments about it. Overall I am happy to have the book, but it isn't the only one I will buy."
1,Not even worth the 10bucks!,I bought it thinking wow ten bucks not much to pay for it and that is worth buying. Well it won't read half of my friends and the ones it can read seem extremely wrong. I bought it without looking at the reviews now I regret that.
1,You do not get what you pay for,"This product is amazing. ""You get what you pay for"" is a commonly used phrase, but with this product that is not the case. You actually get less than what you pay for. I connected the two metal contacts with a paper clip and guess what? Me and the paper clip have the exact same body fat percentage! And somehow, my sissors have the same body fat percentage as me and the paper clip! WOWZERS!"
1,"Inaccurate, do not buy","I am confident that my body fat % is between 10% and 17%. It may even be a bit lower. This device tells me that I'm around 30%. It had a bad interface, a poor feel, and doesn't seem well thought out."
3,Consistent,"Hard to say how accurate this is, but it is consistent. It isnt like some scales I have had that vary by as much as 3 or 4% during the course of a day. However, the accuracy is a big question. Would be nice to compare it to a caliper test and other products for that. Everyone who uses it seems to get a very high reading. Or, maybe we are all just severly overweight. Anyway, for as inexpensive as it is, you can at least judge accurately if your body fat is decreasing or increasing if nothing else."
1,WORTHLESS,"I purchased this so called ""body fat analyzer"" to track my progress and cant believe how cheated out of 6 dollars i felt. im 5'9 170 lift 5-6 times a week and do cardio about 3 times and i have B.F% of 28 according to this piece of crap dont waste your money on this pos."
1,don't buy this,"It doesn't work. At my height and weight, my bmi is around 22, this says I am 38% body fat..."
1,"Like everyone has already said, ""You get what you pay for""","It appears that this just has a little algorithm that calculates your ""Body Fat"" based upon the sex/height/weight you enter. I took this apart and the thumb sensors are, indeed, plastic. How is an electrical current supposed to pass through your body via plastic? What we have is a general body fat calculator based upon the information that is input and a basic alarm clock."
4,An Entertaining B-movie,"This was a pretty good, little horror-comedy film that a lot of people don't know about. If they did, it would get a lot more attention because it's simply entertaining.The DVD has been out-of-print for quite awhile and expensive to get.The 80-some minute story moves along very fast and has good characters. Robin Riker, as ""Denise Gore,"" has a great face and - at least for me - alone is worth seeing the film. The same goes for Amy Dolenz, who is a lot of fun as ""Wendy."" Alan Thicke amazed me with his violin talents.The only bad part is the special-effects, which are poor considering the year this was made (1993) but it is still a very good B-movie that should appeal to kids and adults. I read someplace were adults wouldn't like this, but I'm up in age and I really enjoyed it. However, I wouldn't have little kids seeing this, though.I hope this comes back on DVD because I'd like to see it again. I also wish I had a babysitter in my youth that looked like this!"
3,Focus is on older models....,"I purchased an HP 660LX palmtop - an older model, for sure, but the focus of this volume is on the even earlier, DOS-based units. Though much of the information ""translates"", all the screen captures are from the monotone screen, not color WinCE. The productivity tools referenced have all been replaced by the CE ""Office"" collection, so there is no guidance on these products at all (how to use them together, for example). Of course, most users are familiar with the Office Suite (Excel, Word, Outlook,etc), but if you are not, you will get no information in this book. The web links are still good, however, so there is some useful stuff in here. It would be great if the authors could publish a new edition."
3,End of an era.,"I have grown up reading ""The Ashes"" series and i'll hate to say goodbye to the characters in the series. Hopefully some of the charcters not mentioned in the book survive and make an appearance in ""The Last Rebel"" series. Like Ike, Cecil, Anna, Harley and others. While not the best in ""The Ashes"" series it teaches real life lessons. 1) After all that Ben Raines did, he did'nt deserve to go out killed by a plague from space. Lesson: Life's not always fair. 2) That in times of disaster the worse element in society takes advantage until stopped by decent people willing to risk themselves and not close their eyes and do nothing. 3) The most important in my view, that all things come to an end and from that end comes a new beginning to pull yourselves ""Out of the Ashes"" and begin anew."
4,"Read the entries people, Johnstone is DEAD!!!!","William W Johnstome was suffering from cancer then dies in the early part of 2004. It is believed a ghostwriter did all or part of the last few books due to Johnstone's illness.Sure, it would be nice if the last few books had been written the way Johnstone would have but at least those final books gave us an ending of the Raines saga. Better than being left dangling.I rated the book a 4 because the book helped to show the end of the Raines story."
1,DON'T BUY IT IF YOU LIKED THE REST OF THE SERIES!,"This book was a total insult to the all the readers who spent money and time reading the other 35 books in the series. To end a series in a way that actually insults the readers is hard to do, but Johnstone did it with this one. I don't know if he actually wrote this particular book, but it was bad enough for me not to want to invest any more time in any of the author's books."
1,Escape fron the Ashes,It's a sad day for many Johnstone readers. I think William had best get a new publisher if he thinks this is the best way to end the ashes series. Bad advise you listen to William. I have read all your books. Have enjoyed all of them till now. To end this series in this fashion is... I just can't think of a fitting word that i can write.
1,What a crock,I haven't seen an ending to a series this bad since The Traveler series ended with a time loop back to book one. I agree that the authors been in a rut for some time and that some of his later books were becoming repetive but I'd hoped that he would snap out of it. I'll probably buy the first book in the new series but after the way he ended this series I'd hate to get wrapped up with a new series and be let down this bad. Space spores killing off the entire rebel nation??? Buddy Raines killed in such a disrespectful manner??? A complete lack of buildup for who is supposed the be the primary character in the next series? If spores have landed all over the world why would Rebel forces leave established positions and regroup in Mexico???
1,Feels like I've lost my best friend!,"There's an echo here...I wouldn't have bought it had I known...How can you kill off a scout commander like that? Done in by the old ""injured man on the road with a hidden knife"" trick? It feels like the rug was jerked from under my feet. How do you build a story line and multiple character sketches over two decades or so, and just trash them in one book?! That's not only poor writing, it's like you're divorcing us to run away with a bar waitress!! (No offense meant to bar waitresses, but come on now!) And on top of all that, the blasted book wasn't even bound properly...the first section fell completely out when I opened it to the first page!If this was a movie theater, I'd probably ask for my money back.In any case, if there's even a hint of this sort of treatment for Smoke, I'll burn the whole stack!"
1,Never read & never will,I have all the other Ashes novels and I have enjoyed reading them except for the last couple of books. After having read the reviews of this last book I will never buy it nor will I ever buy another one of Mr. Johnstone's books. To kill off all the main people just to start a new series is dumb. Goodbye Mr. Johnstone I hope your happy you've lost another fan.
1,oh my god,what a pitiful and undeserving ending to a character who has been entertaining us for 20 yrs...i would of never read the book if i had known how it would end...not even all the characters were displayed...i hope this isnt a look into the future writings of mr. johnstone because i do enjoy his writings....if you are a diehard ashes fan dont read or be prepared to scream
1,Escape from the Ashes,"Terrible!!!!!!!! I grew up on this series and to end it like this is a slap in the face. I will never read Johnstone again. The killing of Buddy was a joke as the TEAM never went anywhere without the unit. This one time he was a alone. The attack by the blackshirts? Never before was anyone able to enter the SUSA undetected, but this time multiple times by multiple units? Then a virus from outer space just to start a new series. The old crew could have retired and let Buddy and his group take over where Ben left off! And last but not least, If the series was going to end it would have been nice to tell us what happened to Cecil, Lamar, Ike, Georgie and all the rest. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!"
1,Just to let u know,"Doing an internet search i came across the obituary for Mr Johnstone, turns out he passed away on 8th Feb 04, after a long illness.Think this explains why the ashes series started to change was obvisously using ghost writers and by the sounds of it all the upcoming books will be by ghost writers as well just like the James Axler Deathlands series."
1,Everyone dies,"Yes I bought this book and I have been a long time fan of Mr Johnstones works but I must say this book has been terribly disappointing.Everyone dies including Ben Raines and Buddy, Cooper and Jersey too, some violently but most from, I can't really say this....Space Aliens. Yes Space Aliens come and drop canisters with viruses that wipe out 90% of the Earth's population. As the late Mr Rodgers would say can you spell Bull.....Mr Johnstone says at the end of this book that a year from now ""the Last Rebel"" will debut, I can't say I really care. But a character in this book will appear in that series.Save your money on crap like this, its not worth your time."
4,Looking forward to doing more cooking again!,I haven't really gotten to use it that much yet. I know I will like it more after I have used it a few times.
2,REALLY DISAPPOINTED,"I was excited to see this in the mail, but when I opened it, it took all my strength to get the glass bowls out! The 2 bowls are super heavy, and way too thick! Also, the beaters don't rotate around the bowl, so you have to keep moving the bowl yourself. Seems pretty pointless, considering it is a stand mixer. Terribly disappointed. It was a a gift, but I am hoping to return it."
1,Junk,"This mixer is a peace of junk compared to the older model we had for years,and gouldn't find replacement beaters any longer."
2,not sure how long this mixer will last...,"I've been using the same Sunbeam mixer for the past 29 years so when that mixer finally hit the dust, I decided to go with the same company, thinking that the quality remains the same. But that is not the case. I got this mixer to make cookies and cake, primarily. But even on the lowest setting and even when mixing a thin dough, or even whipping thin whip topping, the top of the mixer SHAKES really badly. Which leads me to believe that this mixer will probably only be good for a few months before it explodes. When that does happen, I will be buying another mixer brand. Also, the glass bowl is REALLY heavy so it is difficult to scrape the bowl. If you need a mixer for a few months to a year, I would say get this mixer because even though it shakes, it does the job, but if you are looking for something that will last longer, spend some more money and invest in a better mixer."
4,Good buy,It reminds me of my first mixer that was a wedding gift in 1972. I like that it is detachable from the base.
4,Sunbeam 2371 MixMaster Stand Mixer,The mixer is perfect it the look and everything. But it is not our style. Too big and confusing for us. I'm sure others can keep it straight.
5,Great value.,This is a very nice mixer for the money. Some reviewers were commenting on the lack of torque at low speeds... I found this to be a nice feature -- it's great for mixing in dry ingredients without a cloud of flour all over the kitchen. Yes the housing is plastic - not metal like those mixers we grew up with - another nice feature - it's not nearly as heavy as those older models. I have a KitchenAide that I no longer use for basic cookies and cakes. This Sunbeam is perfect for everyday mixing.
2,basic mixer sunbeam 2371,"I purchased this for my mother last christmas. Did not last one year. Will not mix doubled sugar cookie mix - motor burned out after only half the flour was added. Mixed box cake mixes and other light products, but do not expect this to work for thicker, heavier mixes. I will buy a larger size to do the heavy work."
3,"Sunbeam 2371 MixMaster Stand Mixer, White",The bowl does not always rotate on its own. You have to help it along at times. The small bowl cannot be shifted to the side to add ingredients which the big bowl allows. Otherwise its really good!
4,Best multi-purpose mixer around,This is my 3rd Sunbeam MixMaster. I got my first one as a wedding gift. It lasted 25 years. Bought another and it was wonderful then I thought I wanted a KitchenAid. For me the mistake was getting the one with the bowl that moves up and down. I found it awkward. Maybe the tilt head would have worked better for me. Gave away my KitchenAid Professional and bought this one. I love it. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of five is because I think the glass bowls with this one are very very heavy. I still have the glass bowls from my first Sunbeam and they are more to my liking.
2,It broke on second try.,"This mixer worked pretty well the first time around, but on the second use of it, the mixing attachments would not release no matter how I pressed the release button. The release button then shifted out of its position and fell into the device itself. Am returning this mixer and hoping to find a better one."
4,SunBeam MixMaster,"I refused to pay $300.00 for a standmixer, and am glad to have found this one ! The glass bowls are very roomy and the height of the mixer allows ample room to work. The assortment of beaters should allow everyone to mix away ! The 350 watts of power helped blend a peanut butter cookie which can become thick. I found clean up quite easy with the glass bowls and the shape of the beaters, not alot of crevices for sticking.The only negative is I was expecting a metal cast mixer. This one has alot of plastic/pvc to it. This makes me nervous as far as durability over years of use, as mentioned in the other reviews I was looking for one just like my Mom had. So far it has performed as I expected."
5,Pleasantly Pleased,"The Sunbeam mixer was purchased for my wife and this is her review.I like it very much. It's quiet, includes dough hooks and whisks and most important, glass bowls. I prefer glass versus steel bowls because I believe the mixing is easier and better. This mixer is made well and for the price is hard to beat."
2,screw on bottom was loose and fell inside and couldn't be retrieved,"The screw that holds the bowl pad was loose and fell out into the cavity. The hole that was made in the plastic base to access the screw was not lined up properly. Liked the way it worked until the screw got loose...returned and received a full refund and for my return shipping. Love amazon, just not this mixer. Haven't decided what to do, liked the idea this mixer wasn't so heavy...."
5,"great mixer, great deal",I love this mixer. It is quiet and efficient. I can't imagine a Kitchen Aid being $250.00 better.
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap - You get what you pay for!!!,"I was trying to save money by purchasing an inexpensive stand mixer that had good reviews rather than spend $200-$300. Well, you get what you pay for. Had this item less than a week and already shipping back to Amazon for refund. Shotty plastic craftsmanship was apparent. The top part that slides up for easy bowl removal popped right off. I was able to reattach but very annoying that it only had so far a range of movement before it popped out of its socket. Then, the button that you push to release the beaters did not work. I couldn't remove the beaters!!! I pushed the button several times to release only for it to release the beaters and the button fell INTO the machine never to be seen again. I decided that was it. Wrapped it back up and sent it back to Amazon TODAY! I'm going to suck it up and buy a Kitchenaid or Hamilton Beach. Just say no to Sunbeam!"
3,My New Mixer,The mixing bowls are heavy glass and are way too heavy for one person to lift....I couldn't scrape the cake mix into the pan...had to have help holding the bowl.
1,Terrible customer service,"I ordered this from Amazon and did not open the box for two months because my oven was not working properly and I was waiting on it to be fixed. The mixer did not work from the minute I opened it. The bowl did not rotate continuously and the beaters did not snap into the mixer. The manual instructs you to call the Sunbeam number. It is an automated system and one of the option is ""does the bowl not rotate properly."" They instruct you to call a service provider. The nearest one to me is over three hours away. The employee told me that if I could not bring this in, I could ship it with the invoice and my complaint. I had to pay $19.00 to ship this. I should have opened the box sooner and tried the mixer so that I could have returned it to Amazon. I still can't believe that a good company like Sunbeam gives such poor customer service. I will never buy another Sunbeam product."
1,Soooo. sooooo bad,"After I bought it I told my daughter and she said that she got one 4 years ago and it did not work. I thought that they would have had to improve it by now. First of all the beaters do not have a shaft going throiugh the middle and a tiny bolt holds them together at the bottom. This seems to weaken the beaters. I tried to cream butter and it threw the butter out of the bowl in chunks. It was sooooo bad. I was very digusted at how badly it preformed...... nothing like the older mixmasters. I took it back and ordered some older models from Ebay to give as gifts for my kids. Even the refurbished ones that are from the 40s or 50s would definately be better to purchase than this terrible, but attractive piece of work! ..."
5,This is a great mixmaster at a super price!,"I'm sure not everyone is as lucky as I was to get this on sale for $69 and free shipping, but if you are, scarf it up fast. This is really nice and works beautiful. I remember my mothers when I was younger, and she loved it. I finally got myself one, and it works even better than I remember when I was growing up. You can't go wrong with this unit!"
1,"POORLY engineered , burnt out in less than a year with minimal use","I really wanted to like this mixer, it was a little flimsy, the way it flipped up and the buttons feel but by using it gently it really was nice to have cakes mix themselves for once. As another review said, triple your recipe and hers burnt out, so did mine. Smoke wisped out of the front and it ceased never to spin again. Sad part was it wasnt even spinning fast, medium slow to be easy on it.I have an old sunbeam handmixer, about 20 years old and it works fine. That a 90 $ mixer gets so easily bested by an ancient 5 dollar supermarket mixer is tragic.Ill not buy another sunbeam mixer if this is their new ""medium"" quality.Fool me twice shame on ME."
4,Did not come with an instruction book,"The mixer looks like it should work well but I did not get an instruction book to know how to operated it correctly. I do not see how to contact the seller to ask for it. I will upgrade my review to a 5 if I receive an instruction manual.Update: I was able to get an instruction sheet after a bit of a hassle. You need a magnifying glass to read it though. As some other reviewers mentioned, I too find that the mixer does not get everything off the bottom. It's like the beaters are up too high. I will leave at 4 stars because of this. It is still a pretty good blender though."
4,Met all my expectations.,"I have had a very old mixmaster mixer for years, handed down from my mother and it always worked very well for me. This was exactly what I was looking for as it does everything I need it to do. I am very pleased with it. My only reason for the rating of 4 is that the glass bowls are very heavy for me to lift when pouring batter into the pan. I know that stainless steel bowls are available but I chose the glass bowls for there durability and sturdiness. I would recommend this product."
2,Sunbeam 2371 Mix Master bowls inferior,"I have been disappointed with Sunbeam 2371 MixMaster mixing bowls. I ordered this inexpensive mixer and set up the mixer to discover the larger mixing bowl had a hairline crack. Amazon was wonderful to send a replacement immediately which I checked out carefully. There were no cracks in either of the bowls included with the mixer. However, I used the mixer one time with the larger bowl and put it through the dishwasher...only to discover that a hairline crack has appeared on this REPLACEMENT mixer's large bowl. Something is amiss here. Bowls to be used in today's kitchen need to be a much higher quality than this AND dishwasher safe. Very very poor quality."
4,Old school design,"I have to admit the primary attraction to me with this mixer was form first, followed by function. I didn't want to spend in excess of $300 for the omnipresent model from ""brand X"". The old school look of this mixer is very appealing to me, although the plastic housing and stand make it obvious this is not your Grandmothers mixer.Functionaly, it is very proficient, and I am sure will be all the mixer I will need for years to come. If buying products made in China is a deterent, stay away from this one, everything down to the box is made in China.All in all I recommend this as a good product."
2,Not longlasting!,"I bought this mixer exactly 2 years ago. I loved it! The bowls are heavy but the mixer itself is not as heavy as the Kitchen Aid, which is what I was looking for. I've made cakes, cookies, yeast-type coffee cake. But today when I mixed the yeast with the flour and stuff, I turned it off to put the dough hooks in and it wouldn't turn on again. It just died in the middle of the process, so had to knead by hand. Not an easy task! I went all over town trying to find a similar item, but all they had was hand mixers and kitchen aids. My mother's and mother-in-laws lasted over 20 years. Don't know why they don't make product to last anymore. This one sure didn't."
4,sunbeam mixer review,"I have only used this once since purchased. It performed just fine. I did try running at different speeds and noticed no problems. This was to replace an old Sunbeam I had for 30 years. I chose this model as I wanted 2 glass bowls and some other models don't come with 2 bowls, and some come with only aluminum bowls which seem to have problems with being too light at the higher speeds. These glass bowls have a slight lip on them but no built in pouring spout which can make emptying the bowl less messy, and I think my old mixing bowls had a slight pouring lip.(but I'm old and I may not be remembering correctly.)"
5,JUST WHAT I NEEDED,"Today, within an hour of front-door mixer delivery, I had a from-scratch streusel coffee cake in the oven. Thismixer replaces a KA which has been passed on to a daughter-inlaw who did not mind the weight and space neededby my ""top-of-the-line"". I thought that I could continue my usual baking with a hand-held mixer and food processor - but, sadly, not so. This Sunbeam set, at 1/4 the cost of my KA, went right to work - love returning to glass bowls after some years of the metal. The heft of the bowls (both were in use with the coffee cake prep) recommend them as quality and easy washup. I did not have to run the mixer above number 1 setting and there was no rattle, wiggle, or walk across the counter - where it will continue to reside, having a smallish footprint. Love that I could add all ingredients during the mixer continuing its' work.Will stop this review, now, for a cup of tea and a piece of warm streusel cake."
2,Slow pace good for baking with little children ... until it breaks,"I bought this strictly for nostalgia, as my mother had the original model throughout my childhood. Hers was all metal, this one all plastic, and it shows.I've used the mixer a few dozen times in three years, always for cakes or icing. I never had confidence it could handle any kind of thick batter. But for my purposes, it was perfect -- I wanted the slow, not-scary rotating bowl for baking with my daughter while she was 2 and then 3. She could stand right next to me and see what was happening, just as I did with my mom way back when.Then last week, the entire back end with the speed dial just fell off. I can't even figure out how it stayed on in the first place, it's so rickety. So out it goes. I enjoyed it while it lasted but, really, it's a pretty sad excuse for a mixer."
1,Very Disappointed!!,"I am so disappointed with this mixer. When trying to make a cake that requires that the yokes be whipped I discovered that both the wisks and beaters are setup from the bottom of the bowl and could not pick the the egg yokes. Also creaming the butter for the frosting was next to impossible. I called Sunbeam and they recommed that I prewisk the eggs yokes and butter before adding to the bowl. If that is the case why have a stand mxer at all. I also felt that it did not blend the ingredients very well. I really enjoy baking, but will think again if it requires the use of this mixer. I had a sunbeam mixer that was my Mothers and then mine that was at least 35 years old and I loved it. I never expected to dislike a product as much as I do this one. If I could return it I would."
3,Sunbeam 2371,"The mixer itself is fine,so far.We've used it for making one batch of divinity and one batch of Tom and Jerry's,and it did a good job.The only fault so far is the glass bowls.Broke the large one setting it down on a concrete floor,a third full of Tom and Jerry batter.Bought stainless replacements from a vendor through Amazon,known as Goodman's.The bowls are poorly made,and came brand new out of the box rusty .Made with pride in China."
3,mixmaster,"I guess it's a good buy for the price! It could have been more powerful, in my opinion. Also, I would like for it to tilt back further when adding ingredients to the bowl."
5,My wife loves her new mixer.,The mixer arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. My wife has used it a couple of weeks now and could not be happier. You should buy one! Amazon.com saved us a lot of money.
3,Pleased and disapointed,"Pleased at use of the mixer but disapointed at Sunbeam of all people having the mixmaster made in China. I almost returned it but the only one made in US I really couldn""t afford."
4,Remarkable Retrospective,"Indeed very remarkable! All the songs here are hits, no dull track every track is on the attack. I'm not much of a Geddy Lee fan apart from being a great musician his voice is annoying, his talent and skills saved the band. For this best of compilation I'm not complaining, moreover the songs here give me memories of my high school days and owning this cd transport me back in long lost lovable times. Only missing is ""enemy within"" I would have given this a 5 stars had they included that track."
3,A fair compilation of some of Rush's finest tunes,"I've been hooked on Rush since I first heard their tune, ""Tom Sawyer"" from the album, ""Moving Pictures""(1980) when I was thirteen. While not the best band in the world,--and they have been on the wane since the album, ""Roll the Bones (1991)""-- they are the best of the best that Canada has had to offer in its brief history of rock.All of the musicians in the band are extremely talented, but more so with Geddy Lee than anyone else. His ability to juggle between bass and synthesizer was what got me into Rush's tunes. Combined with the smooth drum rolls by Neil Peart, the tunes blow your mind away.However, it makes me sad to say that the compilation is rather disappointing. It left out some of the band's finest songs, among them, Freewill (1979), Countdown (1981), and Working Man (1974). Over all, fair but disappointing than the ""Chronicles""(1990)."
2,Un-needed compilation album,"I have been a Rush fan since 1976, and have seen every tour since 1980. I feel that this was a poor choice for a ""retrospective"" the song mix is as usual, radio songs and unfortunatly radio songs are not always the best on the album. For a new listner, this album falls far short of Chronicles. For the old die-hards, it's very disappointing. If you have all the studio albums and live albums as I do, your best bet is to record your own tape or cd of favorites. If you do not have all the studio albums, and would like an overview album, stick with Chronicles."
5,XFO is fantastic,The XFO is a fantastic new flying toy. Very easy and fun to fly. The online desription on Amazon is wrong. NO batteries are required except one 9 volt for the transmitter. It does NOT need to be pumped up. It comes complete with portable recharging pack.
1,This toy stinks!,"We were very disappointed with this toy. XFO never made it past 3 feet, if it made it off the ground at all!"
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!,"Oh man. What a disaster. I bought this item for my sons Christmas. It is now the day after Christmas (had to wait 16 hours to charge unit) and I had a child trying to get this toy to take flight. NOTHING. I went on the Tyco site to seek advice as stated by the instructions! GO LOOK AT THE SITE! tyco.com. It has nothing to do with the toys. I could not even find the info about trouble shooting as it said. I am sure by the other reviews you see that some of them work. Sadly, are you willing to take the chance yours will be one of the many that won't. Very disappointed."
4,Flight in the Night,"At first it was like a bird floppy on the grass. After discharging it and recharging it, we get it going in the dark under the flood lights of the night. One point is to hold it by its base and let all the juice run down and then recharge it.Three excited kids watched in go up over fifty feet into the dark sky. This is a great toy, give a chance and work with it."
4,"We finally figured it out, and it ain't that bad","We thought the toy sucked, but it just took a few tries to get enough charge into the copter. Then, we had a much better time. Flights went 40+ feet high, and lasted 3 or 4 minutes.My 5 and 7 year old boys love it. Yes, it is fragile, but for $35 bucks, what do you expect from a flying toy.Just get some glue or something to put it back together, make sure that the battery is really really charged, and have at it."
4,No problem here,"Sorry to hear that the other reviews weren't happy with there XFO. We had no problem with ours, right out of the box the assembly went well. Had to charge the rocket a couple of times to get the maximum power out the batteries. But overall were very happy with it. My son & I love it!!!"
1,this is a dud,"VERY disapointed! Maybe ours is defective, but so far it hasn't gotten more than 2 feet off the ground! For the money, it's not worth it!"
2,What a waste,"I brought this toy for my 12 year old son. We flew it for the first time today. It crashed and the wing broke. At just over 5ft, I expected more from something that was supposed to be a ""rocket"". to be honest I would not recommend this toy to anyone. It is not durable at all and if from that height it can fall and lose a wing... I would suggest that it is not really a ""rocket"". Forget this toy... go to a hobby shop and get something real. The description of the product is very misleading."
3,wouldn't fly straight,"I like the idea of the toy. I was a bit dissapointed after opening to the box to find that it was styrofoam, since the picture on the box made it look like plastic. It still looked like it would be a lot of fun, but it immediately began veering off in wierd directions, and I could get it to fly straight up. This was a little disappointing for my 6-year-old son who thought Santa gave him a defective toy. I'm trying to decide whether to get another one and give it another chance or go out and get one of those Air Hog Resistors."
2,What a dissapointment!,"the product doesn't work as advertised, foam construction is not a good use of building material for a ""childs"" toy...it doesn't hold up to their playing, you would be lucky to have the XFO fly more than a foot off the ground, there are no directional controls except for up and and down so it may decide to propel at any direction, for the $60 I paid for this before x-mas I would say I was ripped off as well as my child of 9yrs of age"
1,Amazon Rip Off,"What a huge waste of money. I paid $$$ on this very site not but a month ago, now it is $$. Got it home, followed the instructions and the silly thing will not get but about a foot off the ground if that, and then it just falls over and beats itself into the ground. Don't waste your cash on this, give your kid a fifty dollar bill and let them light it on fire, they'll have for fun."
4,This album is a great sampling of Lady Day's entire career.,"For those unable to decide where to begin when buying a Billie Holiday album, This is Jazz #15 is a great place. I was extremely frustrated when I saw all the quintissential volumes. I decided to get an album that had songs released throughout Billie's career-a sampling for future purchases. The music is great, and her singing is superb. There's nothing ""new"" here, it is just organized well."
2,Bla,The books pages were bent which did not make me happy. There was more highlighting then was mentioned. This book is a waste of time.
1,Writer needs writing class,This writer has a poor command of the English language. His ideas for motivating student writers are mundane and sometimes silly. I am sorry I spent so much for this book.
3,the redzart review,"I was looking for more of a teaching feel to this video,but the video is a good video because as a drummer you can pick up on some real cool licks.I would recommend this video to any skill level drummer."
3,Fun lucha and American action...,"Fun lucha and American style pro-wrestling video in general. I found it for a very low price new at a local grocery store. When El Hijo del Santo is featured, you have to get it if you are a true lucha fan.The matches were very entertaining, and to watch the perpetual rivalry between LA Park and Santo, Jr. is worth every penny.Recommended for true Mexican lucha fans and serious wrestling marks."
4,Great & Bad,"Wes Montgomery is one of the greatest & most influential jazz guitarists. This album is not his finest hour, though, it's just an hour of Verve music. I don't have all the Verve stuff, so I can't say if it's his best Verve stuff, though I guess it isn't.The best songs on this disc are truly great. It's the meatier jazz stuff - for example Impressions & Milestones that's the best. Some of the smoother stuff is still pretty impressive - for example Bumpin' On Sunset is slightly corny but the guitar is great. The worst commercial stuff, like Tequila, knocks a star off.I think a good place to start, or continue, with Wes Montgomery is ""Incredible Jazz Guitar""."
4,great noise,"super session was one of the mainstays of my late-60's record collection - the days when all we needed instead of viagra was a decent stereo, some combustible leaves and the music. kooper and bloomfield, paul butterfield, clapton, alvin lee, phill simmonds et.al....where do we find talent like this in today's music world, or have i just gotten too old to look?this cd of live performances by al and mike brings a lot of the memories back...including the limitations of the recording equipment used to bring us the great live jam sessions that were integral to the times. the only reason to give this cd 4 stars is because of the faithful reproduction of the hiss...something that now annoys my middle-aged sensibilities!as for the music....i have not had too much opportunity to listen, as my 17 year old son has monopolised the cd since i received it last week....albeit to say that 5 stars is not enough to describe my reaction to the music when i heard it again after nearly 30 years!"
5,Sonny Boy would have been proud,"As far as I know, neither Bloomfied nor Kooper actually met or played with Sonny Boy Williamson II (Alex ""Rice"" Miller) the salty, sotted, and brilliant subject of ""Sonny Boy Williamson"" (Peter Brown of Cream's tribute to Sonny Boy), the author (with sideman Elmore James) of ""One Way Out"" (on the second two-CD volume of this concert) and ""No More Lonely Nights"" (actually ""No Nights By Myself"" written for Sonny Boy by Lillian McMurry, Trumpet Records owner and a blues lady in the finest sense).As Sonny Boy's biographer, I'd love to know where these two discovered the magic of Sonny Boy. [...]Bo;;"
4,"great, soulful music","I still have the double-LP from when it came out (one of the LPs still bears popcorn butter stains from a party), and have always treasured it. It oozes with soul and is superior, in my opinion, to Super Sessions. Bloomfield's cover of Albert King's ""Don't Throw Your Love On Me So Strong"" is a masterpiece.Are there weak spots? Sure, but that's part of the experience - the weak spots are easily outweighed by the highlights and by the overall feel of the album, which is from an era when musicians took chances. If you're looking for polish, you'll probably be disappointed. If you're looking for the kind of warmth and spontaneity that is seldom heard at live shows anymore, this album is highly recommended.A very special album, unlike anything else I own, and I own just about everything. If you're at all interested in the work of either of these musicians, or if you want to experience the '60s jam aesthetic, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it."
3,"Every track is amazing, but I want more","Great music, every track is great, but I want more. Two demerits to Columbia for not remastering this masterpiece and adding the full recording of I Wonder Who and other improvements. All they did on the CD transfer was copy the LP to CD! And, for 3 full nights of playing, this is a pathetic offering, a total of only 85 minutes of music on 2 CDs. Boooo!"
5,...too bad!,"Bought this album when it came out and was blown away by it...epecially ""That's Allright Mama"" and ""Green Onions"". I was seventeen. I thoght it was good but I also thight that there would be better music of this level to come as I got older. It's been nearly 40 years since and there hasn't...too bad!"
2,I can't believe they actually reissued this on CD,"One of the worst albums of its era - an instant joke. I am tempted to buy it just for the nostalgic value. This was the album everybody tried to sell to raise cash. Mike Bloomfield's famous introduction is by far the highlight of the album. Amazing that it is available on CD, but I'm glad that it is."
4,A great study manual,I really enjoy this commentary. It is not dry and boring or too deep. This is perfect for someone wanting to understand the book of Matthew more in depth.
1,"Fine Movie, Shoddy Presentation","""Twice in a Lifetime"" is a good drama and worth seeing. Unfortunately, this new DVD is not widescreen as Warner Home Video originally announced, but instead is an especially poorly done pan-and-scan presentation. I do not recommend this disc and am posting this as a public service to those who might be misled by Warner's original announcement or Amazon's ""technical details,"" which are incorrect."
1,HORRIBLE DVD QUALITY,"Gene Hackman is my favorite actor, but with technology the way that it is, I would expect a better DVD transfer than this! It's dirty with scratches and spots and dropouts. Plus, it's only in full-frame format. NO WIDESCREEN!I gave it 1 star because of Gene Hackman's performance but for me, it's unwatchable.The tragedy is that this may be the only transfer done of this movie, since it's not a block buster.COME ON GUYS, LET'S SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME ON THESE MOVIES! THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF GENE HACKMAN FANS OUT HERE!By the way, same review for TARGET, although it is in widescreen. That was also very disappointing."
4,Twice in a Lifetime,"I was raised in the town of Snohomish Washington, where this movie was filmed. I bought it for only one reason I wanted to See Snohomish on film. If you live in the northwest you need to get a copy for yourself, so you to can recognize some of the buildings and streets that you also know. In the end of the movie there is a wedding that was filmed in the old First Baptist church. I built the cross that hangs in the baptistry for my sisters Wedding years before, it was kinda neat to see it hanging there and know that my work is in the movies. If you choose to watch it you will enjoy it.The Railroadman"
1,horror film,we never got beyond 10 minutes ...video quality was close to zero....get loosing the signal due to film technical problems...TOTAL RIP OFFAndy and sandy newman
4,"Snappy, typical Simak.","A very characteristic book for Simak. This is not ""easy reading"", but it will reward those willing to think."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Humanity is again thinking about genetic engineering as a tool for the exploration of space, to look at malleable androids, or other forms that could interact easily with alien beings and environments.This had been tried before, and failed, because melding with alien beings or minds allowed them partial or full control of the host, and they could change forms back at times - hence the Werewolf Principle."
1,I HATED IT,"I am a huge Rainbow fan, with my favourite singers being Dio and Graham Bonnet. I also love blackmore's style. With this tribute album i thought the band did pretty good. But the singer ruined the whole lot for me. It was screechy, shakey, all over the place and just downright horrible. Not saying I could do any better but im not the one creating a tribute album here. When I listen to the original version of catch the rainbow, i feel relaxed and peaceful. When I heard this version i had to turn it off straight away, it was just an utter joke. But this is just my opinion."
1,Arrived non-functional,"Prompt refund received. Replacement was not offered, only refund upon receipt of returned item. Wish the product had worked, but I am not unhappy with the outcome of this transaction."
3,Sorry but I just don't get Art Tatum,"Technically impressive in terms of speed of thought and finger no doubt, but Tatum's playing has never done it for me. Am I really alone? What I get is a succession of cleverly played notes. I have had a few tries, but never end up wanting more, and I never feel he is inside the music. It may be down to recording limitations of the time, but I also don't hear much light, shade or shape. I realize it is sacrilege to say it but I regard Oscar Peterson as far the better musician, and his reverence toward Tatum is a sign of the Peterson's modesty. Once you've heard a few Tatum tracks, there will be little in the rest of his output that will surprise you. And if it's piano technique per se that you're interested in, listen to Marc-Andre Hamelin. Sorry Tatum fans."
2,a mixed bag,A music on this disc is very good and can be a good introduction into Tatum's world.It's also not too complicated.Bad news is quite poor sound quality.Good for listenign through PC speakers but decent Hi-Fi system reveals all recording's shortcomings and make it quite disapointing.
5,Tatum At His Best,"This is undoubtedly one of the greatest jazz albums out there. The pure genuis of Tatum is simply astounding. Although Tatum plays almost all standards on this album, he plays them in his own woderfully complex and creative style in a manner that makes his versions unbeatable. Anyone who thinks that Monk was the greatest jazz piano player of all time better pick this up and go to school. His version of ""Tea For Two"" is still considered to be the standard by which all versions are measured by. ""Tiger Rag"" is played so unbelievably fast and complex that it sounds like there are three pianists playing at the same time! Every song on this album is a gem so pick this one up A.S.A.P. You will not be disappointed."
5,team magma rocks!!!,the team magma deck rocks! it has strong and cool cards like team magma's Groudon. it also has cool cards like tema magma's rhydon. the team magma deck is totaly the BEST!!!
3,repeat of other tapes,"I have a number of CDs by Cerolyn Myss which I have found benefical, however fo me, i found this tape to be more of a review of some of her other CDs, so for me there was really nothing new. If you do not own a Carolyn Myss CD then I think you would find this interesting and insightful, but if you have one or two CDs, I would pass on this one."
2,Terribad,As expected the stories are pretty bad and some of the acting is downright terrible...but for $2.99 it served as a good distraction.
2,DEADTIME STORIES,"Nothing I haven't seen before! Deadtime Stories was like watching Tales from the Cyrpt, but on a more limited budget."
3,Fashion design 1950-2000,"This book has great illustrations of designer fashion for the era's between 1950-2000 the images are smaller than I thought they would be about 6 on a page in average, but still show what the designs looked like etc. Only had a few pages of written information included at the start of the book. CD-ROM has the same images as the book easy to use images in assignments or research.Great book for secondary and tertiary level student, that are just wanting illustrations to use in their work.Overall good book, but it would have been nice to get more written information included in this book and some larger illustration!"
4,One of a kind recording,"Most of the cuts on this album are standard fare, and it is not clear how this collection could be considered the ""Essential"" Tanya Tucker. However, this is the one and only album I have found with her cover of ""I'm Not Lisa"" on it, which is why I bought it. The version of this song that is out there in ""file sharing"" land is a terrible audio recording, evidently taken from an actual record player, and one of poor quality at that. If you want that song, this is the CD for you, but if you're that much of a Tanya Tucker fan, you undoubtedly have all the other songs from this CD in your collection already."
2,This broke within a week...,This broke within a week or two of receiving the product - it was used a few times with playdough and was not handled roughly. I returned it and decided against getting a replacement. Maybe I received a lemon? It seemed to be great quality...
5,Works great for a junior baker!,My grandaughter pulls this out every time I go to make biscuits. She loves it and it is very well made and sturdy.
3,A little disappointed,"Based on the picture I thought this item included two rolling pins. I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my children so they can help bake and each have their own. It's not a huge deal, but for anyone purchasing this item, it only includes one rolling pin.The product appears well made and heavy duty. Perfect size for little hands. :)"
1,broken,roller was broken along wood grain when arrived . the bad thing is that im possitive that it was like this when it was shipped and it was sent anyhow. if you know you have a defective product you should not sell it! not worth the hastle to return a 5 doller item. I will probably fix myself by painting with polyurethane since it is bare wood.
3,Large Rolling Pin Review,"I ordered this rolling pin for my granddaughters, to go with a miscellaneous kitchen basket for theirChristmas gift...including aprons and chef hats and cookbooks. The rolling pin is very nice and theyseem to like it but I was a little surprised by the size. The description calls it a large rolling pinbut it's really not. I'm sure it will work out fine but it is much smaller than I expected."
3,How to unstick the play doh,"This rolling pin is very sturdy, good size for a two year old but the play doh sticks to the pin and won't come off which is frustrating to my little one. Does anyone have a solution?"
2,Not the best for playdough,I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for playing with playdough. I was disappointed when I got it because the wooden roller part had a dent or two that could give splinters. Also the playdough stuck to the wood. I guess this mini rolling pin would be good for other purposes.
3,Deceptive,"Amazon picture shows two rolling pins, I thought I will be getting two in my order. I only got one. Very Deceptive."
1,Handles broken,"I bought 12 rolling pins for my Sabbath School class and one handle broke the first time it was used. The others held up,though, so it wasn't a total disaster. However, I would recommend finding sturdier rolling pins."
5,Ignore the other two reviews. They don't know what they're talking about.,"I am so pleased to see to see this classic book back in print. Jacob Abbot is one of the most talented historians to come out of the 1800's. His biographies and historical fiction are enchanting, accurate and an absolute joy to read. This one about Darius and the Persian Empire is appropriate for ages 12 to adult. It's easy to understand, gives enough detail without overburdening the reader with useless information, and paints an accurate picture of the events it describes. Definitely a worthwhile purchase."
1,dang,"I was really disappointed, basically they guy summarizes Herodotus; with no new information on Darius, other than just critizing Herodotus for his improbable accounts....I was expecting something different"
2,An 1878 publication reprinted!,"There is nothing in the Amazon blurb to indicate that this is a publication of 1878 which was simply reprinted in 2003! Silly me, I thought I was purchasing a very recent publication. Although very readable, the book clearly displayed the knowledge about Darius available to the nineteenth century reader and nothing more recent. In addition the dust jacket incorrectly referred to Sir Henry Rawlinson's copying and decipherment of the Behistun inscriptions of Darius as happening in the ""early 18th century"" - in fact, he was born in 1810!"
4,Even deeper into the inferno,"Night and the City, Kersh's best known novel, is indeed a trip through hell -- but only an upper ring, compared to the depths he enters in Prelude to a Certain Midnight. This book anticipates writers such as Hubert Selby in the examination of evil; its characters are very well drawn, the crime itself is hideous but mostly kept off the page, the society that allows it is dissected with unflinching attention. Kersh does spin incredibly strong sentences, and often touches the bottom of his characters' souls. But no picnics or fairy tales here. Tough stuff."
4,A Blues Dozen of Wonderful Ladies from Mercury,"An Exciting Nostalgic Collection of Blues Vocalists fromAlma to Zilla (Mondy to Brown) - a half dozen cuts both.Also, tunes from other somewhat unknown but thrilling artists: LA's Vivian Green and Violet Hall; two of Kansas City's greatest: JUlia Lee and the exhilerating Myra Taylor.Catch cuts by Ella Johnson, Mildred Andeson, Meredith Howard and Joyce Jackson as well the greats: Helen Humes, Sippie and Dinah. This is a Real Find for those appreciating the wonderful sounds of Pre-War Women Artists"
5,This Album Is Awesome How DId I Miss It The First Time!,I just heard this incredible album on a Blog Site (Garden of Sound) & it isawesome. I don't know how I missed it the first time around. These other reviews here are very accurate. One of the best straight ahead rock albums I've ever heard. Everyone in the band is great. I'm now going to look for albums Steve Hunter is on to buy.
4,Perfect for a rainy day!,"If you enjoy old b&w movies, these are great and perfect for that day you want to curl up with a bowl of popcorn and enjoy!"
5,LOVE THESE OLD MOVIES,The quality is very good on these old moveis. Have only had the chance to view three so far. Saving the rest for cooler time. I would recomend these to any one who loves Nick and Nora.
5,The Complete Thin Man Collection,I have always loved the Thin Man movies and to have them in one collection is great.
4,Complete Thin Man Collection - quality product,"Bought this collection for my wife, who has always enjoyed seeing the Thin Man movies when she happened to catch one on cable.The quality of the movies is excellent. There is no noticeable noise or other indication that you are watching a very old movie, other than the fact they are in B&W; of course.I recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys comedies of this time period."
5,Love the Thin Man,My wife introduced me to the Thin Man back in the 70's on late night tv. I did not fully appreciate it then...since they were chopped up my commercials and low quality over the air signal. These dvds are good quality and the Alias Nick and Nora bio is a real joy to watch. We march these out every two years or so and have Thin Man marathon.
3,damaged disc,"one of the discs was loose in the case, is scratched and does not work.would like to get a new one but don't know how to go about it."
2,The Complete Thin Man Collection,"Great, collection! Reasonable price. Everyone in the family is enjoying it - as our the neighbors who are borrowing various episodes."
3,You need to know,This a series that was very popoular in my growing up days. We watched most of the episodes during that time.
4,Nice to Have this set again,"While I didn't particularly like the packaging of this Thin Man series, I enjoyed having the series again. I owned all six in VHS format several years ago but sold them. It's nice that the series is still available and now in DVD. I have reviewed one or more of these separately. They are all worth watching more than once."
5,ole movie buff,great cant say enough about this series. loved the thin man movies as a kid and still do. Wish there were more
5,Great Box Set!!!!!!!!!!!,"We are really enjoying this box set of old time who-done-its with Nick, Nora and Asta. The quality of the picture and sound is great as well."
2,Rating based on product received not Thin Man movies,"I love the Thin Man movies but this review applies to these types of series which carry multiple DVDs. My DVD set plays 5 of the six movies it brings and this is the second time it happens to me when I'd purchased a set. I have also found it difficult to contact seller and make them aware of this problem. Both sets appeared brand new but had the same issue, DVD would not play on any of the DVD players I own. Great series of movies but buyer beware when buying these sets."
3,The Complete Thin Man Collection,"I have enjoyed the Thin Man series since I was a child. Owned the VHS collection and wanted the DVD for the improved video quality. I was so disappointed in the quality of this collection. The first disc did not even play and this was The Thin Man, my favorite in the series! I've watched three more in the series since, and find them good. Disappointed, since I have purchased other collections with very good quality?"
3,over rated at 5 stars,"when i buy things i ike it ALL to work. in tis set there is one dvd which is more a trailer and not at all a movie, as such to me it a waste. additionally in some of the dvd's there is included a radio recording of their shows. the recording is so bad it is impossible to hear the words spoken, and as such...a waste.the dvd's with movies are clear and good. i give this a 3 star rating based on not being able to hear the radio programs included as well as the final 'nick and nora' dvd which is a promotional dvd and NOT any movie as i had thought it would have been, making the cost of the actual movie dvd's higher by 12% or so. that is then getting pricey...they have sold an illusion of a 7 dvd movie set when there are in reality only 6."
4,"Witty, engaging fun","Having seen only 2 of the movies in the ""Thin Man"" series on late-night TV (marred by numerous commercial interruptions and merciless editing), I still enjoyed them enough to try buying this full set.What good luck that I did! Nick and Nora Charles are even more fun when viewed without commercial interruptions.If you enjoy slapstick comedy, razor-sharp writing and talented stars who are perfect foils for one another, this is a near-perfect choice.Having been made in another era, these black-and-white movies make light of Nick's excessive drinking. With the exception of that one caveat, though, I wholeheartedly recommend you sit back and prepare to enjoy a wonderful ride through the mad world of the Charles family."
5,Awesome chemistry!!!!,Adorable movie!!! Perfect for a rainy day on a cozy couch!!! The chemistry is just perfect between Powell & Loy!!! Very whity & a little mystery in every movie.
5,Thank you Warner Bros.!!!! The Thin Man has arrived!!!,"Finally, the excellent Thin Man series is coming in a definitive set!!! I have been waiting for this release for a very long time. William Powell and Myrna Loy are absolutely fantastic in these films and in my opinion, are one of the greatest of the onscreen duos (right up at the very top with Hepburn and Tracy). Their chemistry together is pitch perfect and these films are a delight to behold. The best, I think, is the second entry in the series: After The Thin Man. This is an excellent sequel and probably the best of all of them (though each is great in its own right).Well, enough said, order this great box set right now and treasure these classic films for years to come!!(Also, Thank you to Warner Brothers for realizing the importance of releasing classic films on DVD. You're doing a great job with your releases and are catching up to Criterion quite quickly)."
5,This is the Best of the best!,"Old movies like this remind me how terrible most of the new movies are terrible. This series is funny and I mean fun and the whole family is involved even the dog, it is truly the best purchase I have ever made."
4,thin man collection,"Love the old movies, great set except one of the bio.s did not work but it was an extra anyway so can't complain."
5,Wonderful movies,"This set is an outstanding series to add to your movie list. I love watching William and Myrna. It opened up other movies that I didn't know exsisted. I recommend this set to all lovers of old, comedies."
4,WLH,"This is 40's classic entertainment. The collection provides a murder mystery series that is clean, fun, and provides an escape from the daily grind. The lead actors (William Powell and Myrna Loy) have a chemistry that is refreshing every time any one of the films in the Thin Man collection is viewed. The collection is a must for any old comic mystery buff that will be enjoyed for years."
3,the thin man series,this collection is just fantastic .It is very nostalgic .Good actors .Very clear films .Should be more old films around
5,HOURS OF ENJOYMENT,This is a wonderful collection for any fan of The Thin Man. I had enjoyed one episode on a movie channel and then wanted to see the others. The price is very reasonable for the collection and I didn't have to hunt around for single copies.
5,What's not to love.,"What's not to love about the Thin Man Series? Nick and Nora are delightful, Asta is precious, and the stories are simple, but diverting.The sound and picture quality of the series is excellent, and I especially apprecitate that it is left in the original black and white."
4,Really funny!,"For being from a different era than I'm used to, I sure find these movies funny. I first saw the Thin man on TV and I bought this collection shortly after. They are a great bunch of movies to watch with the family. Myrna Loy and William Powell are a great couple in the films."
5,When I was young,(The Thin Man) with William Powell and Mryna Loy is some of the greatest entertainment from the 40's. Of course my favorite actor in this is Asta the Terrier who by the way achieves alot of air time. (The Thin Man) series with all of it's positives is value in price. Great film for the whole family including especially Grandfather and Grandmother. Watch how Nick methodically solves some of the most difficult cases with the help of coarse of Nora and somtimes Asta.FROM THE 40'S 5 STARS +
4,Thin Man Series,"This is one of the best video series I have purchased in a while. The collection contains Nick and Nora on murder cases and their whimsical way of solving these crimes. Their chemistry is highly entertaining as Nora continuously tries to help her husband Nick on each case. They remind me of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy and the movies they did together. You do not necessarily have had to watch them in a row for each movie is its own separate identity. The last dvd is a synopsis of both actors', William Powell and Myrna Loy, biographies."
5,Love old movies!!!!,"Just what I wanted. For anyone who loves old movies, these Thin Man movies are the best. No violence, suspense, mystery. They are great!!!!"
5,Awesome!,"I got this as a gift for my mom, this was the cheapest place I found it, plus it was all new."
4,TheThin Man Thick with Enjoyable Viewing,"The Thin Man Series was produced in Holliwood in a time when one thing was required over everything else, Talent! In all aspects of this series the talents of the Actors, Directors, Producers, Writers and others responsible for movie production previeled. A Series of Movies with Action, Adventure, Mystery and twists of humor could not be reproduced with modern tecknology or talent. A Series well worth the time to view and enjoy!"
4,Hair Is A Concern,"My daughter received the ""my first"" love-a-lot bear as a present when she turned one, and immediately she began snuggling it and carrying it around. She likes to have the bear in her crib with her when she sleeps. I think the gentle jingle sound is soothing to her when she shakes the bear. The bear's little curl of hair began to look frayed within a week of having it. But until I read the previous post, I never imagined the hair would pull out of the head completely. I think I'll just cut the hair off. Aside from that issue, I think this toy is fine for one-year olds, and my daughter loves hers very much."
5,Great product!,We have been using these tool bags for 8yrs. in my business and they are the most durable I have used in my 38yrs. as an appliance tech.
5,H.V.A.C. Service Tech,I bought this bag approx 1 year ago and found itto be one of the best investments I've made in along time...it is truly awesome for my line of workand I highly recommend this bag for practically alltypes of service applications..!Bill Davis
2,Another Tool Bag,"The tool bag is nice but I felt it was over rated for the function. Mainly used it for onsite repairs of networks and telephone systems but found that although it was a nice looking, strong built bag, it was difficult to find my tools in the shadows of the zipper pull down. I also didn't like the way it carried, it felt unbalanced. I switched back to a cheap $25 dollar aluminum case from HD which I have to replace every year because they fall apart."
5,Best tool bag ever used.,"I admit that this bag is relatively expensive, but when you are done with your job and can see all your tools standing up, you can inventory your tools in a flash. I have a specific location for every tool in this bag and always see when I left one out of place and retrieve it or them before I leave the job. There's nothing worse then loosing a tool and having to back track, especially when each tool is 30 to 60 bucks apiece. Highly recommended if you want to see whats in your bag right away."
5,Great bag for any mechanic,Great bag for any mechanic that needs to carry tools were ever they go. Theifs like them also. Needs tracking device option.
5,Best HVAC Service Bag I've Ever Owned,"Great Tool Bag. Got my first one ripped off, had to get another. Although its a little too big for my needs I'll never carry anything else (unless they make one 3/4 size)."
5,Wow! Almost Perfection!,"This bag is an outstanding product! Even better than I expected. Not cheap ...but will last forever. Gobs of pockets! If you like being organized, this bag is for you. I even made a few extra pockets by super gluing some partitions to the ones behind them."
1,This is probably the worst step video ever!,"I can only agree with the previous reviewer who advised to avoid this one. I think I purchased it and returned it to the store. It's been a couple of years since I did this video, but I still remember it as being awful. Cory's counting and cueing were off and many of the moves were unsafe. I would not recommend this tape to anyone!"
4,Hard to get but works great,My elderly mother has poor fitting dentures and because they were moving around a lot she was getting lots of mouth sores. This product helped her so much she was able to be much more comfortable.
3,Good but not the best,"I have been a chronic sufferer of canker sores for a long time. They have made my life miserable at times. When I went to the doctor, he recommended Zilactin to me. I have been using it for years since. It hurts like nothing else I have experienced when you put it on but then you can enjoy a meal or get some sleep for a while. They have no noticeable affect as far as healing time goes but do provide some relief. Canker Covers are much more effective and have changed the game for me. Give them a shot.Quantum Canker Cover"
3,It numbs things,"It temporarily numbs things, yes. Not for very long. Reapplying it isn't always practical. I'd probably look for other products. I personally can't recommend anything else ATM because I haven't used many different Canker Sore Gels."
4,B12 deficiency,"My brother would break out in canker sores. He discovered he has a severe defiency in vitamin B12. If you have them often, have your doc check your b12 levels. Zilactin works well on canker sores."
5,The Very Best Product,Our family has used Zilactin for years and it is the best for canker sores. We have tried other products but they don't measure up to this one. If you use it right away when you fill the canker sore it goes away in the first day use.
3,"NOT ""All Thru the Night"" Dry, BUT Very Protective of Skin","We bought these because we LOVE Tranquility's ""All Through the Night"" Adult Diapers, and we were hoping that these pull-on ""Overnight"" diapers from the same company would be equivalent and easier to use. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. Over the past 3 nights, the only way I find I can keep the bed dry underneath my small, elderly mother when using these is to put a substantial overnight pad inside them AND a diaper (Depends) over it. Even then, the quilted, waterproof bed pad was damp and needed to be laundered! So, apparently, these pull-on diapers are really not meant to go ""All Through the Night"" like the diapers they make with tabbed sides. (I will go back to using them.) I still give 3 stars, however, because they really protected Mom's skin from urine all through the night - and she finds them very comfortable to wear. I can recommend them, therefore, for those who are incontinent during the day."
5,A true journey of faith,With great honesty and compassion Nigel Taylor invites us along on his journey of faith. I could not put this book down. It reads like a good novel. Now I am going back through the book and studying the insights offered in the footsteps. I believe this book will be of value to any spiritual seeker.
1,Zero stars was not an option,"Perhaps Mr. Taylor should take a few writing courses after he ""survives"" yet another ""near death experience."" A previous reviewer said it best. He is no Depak Chopra. I would suggest reading something with some substance by an author who is not only trust worthy, but educated. ""Autobiography of a Yogi"" is a good place to start. At least this ""Master"" was never vain or felt it necessary to drive a red Mercedes called Love."
1,He is no Depak Chopra,"Perhaps this ""enlightenned"" writer should leave his pen to the professionals. The poorly constructed ramblings of a ..., ...should I say wallabe, guy jumping on the coat tails of anything that will drag him up the monetary ladder. Nothing rings true except perhaps that Nigel profoundly produced yet another peice of vanity press. Save your money!!"
5,The entire mental health profession is a load of crap!,"Szasz is a psychiatrist who realized that the entire mental health profession is a load of crap - and so are politics, religion, and American sexual morality. In ""The Untamed Tongue,"" Szasz dissects the language of almost every single field of human ""knowledge,"" exposing hypocrisy and obfuscation with wit, clarity and precision. A must read for anyone interested in the role of language in thought control."
5,For people who dare to think,One of the great minds of our time is distilled to the essentials. Great wit and even greater insights. This and other Szasz offerings belong in the library of educated people.
1,Horribly mastered CD,"I have Field Work on a Japanese 12"" vinyl single from 1985. I have already digitized it and it sounds great. I bought this CD under the assumption that it would sound better than a 27 year old record. I was completely wrong. Whoever mastered this 2002 release used heavy limiting to the point where they have lopped off any and all dynamics in order to make the CD as loud as possible. On top of that, it's not even as clear and defined as the vinyl release. I am NOT an audiophile freak.I would NOT recommend buying this and instead, I recommend buying a used vinyl copy from eBay. There are numerous 12"" and 7"" vinyl copies available as I type this.It is not Amazon's fault, but this is the worst product I have ever gotten from them. I can't make my disappointment clear enough. If you like this song, stay as far away from this CD as you can!"
1,Four Whats?,"This class was terrible so my review is going to be a bit biased. I did not enjoy the book or the class. I thought the book a bit confusing, just like the class is."
5,Great underseen film,"This movie is somewhat experimental, yes, but if you like Hackman or Pacino, you will go for this film because it rides on the strength of their collective talents. It's sort of like Of Mice and Men meets Waiting for Godot. Can you imagine two huge movie stars (Hackman and Pacino both in their absolute prime) playing two drifters in a low-budget film like this today? These are great, uncharacteristic performances by both men. In its visual style (lots of long takes and jump cuts) and story arc (or lack thereof) you can see why this film would appeal so much to French audiences (it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes). Therefore, if you detest French cinema, you probably won't like this film much. If you enjoy great acting, though, you will love Scarecrow."
4,"This movie was very well done a little to long perhaps, but,","very touching and down to earth. With the talent and charm of Al Pacino and the crusty gruffness of Gene Hackman their opposite personalities really mesh. Hackman the cold loner, Al the goofy, but loveable loser. This movie was not liked by critics, and I don't really understand why. Its really an overlooked, well done buddy flick about two very lonely people who find a connection. Enjoy."
5,"Wacky, crazy film!","I remember seeing this in the movies as a little girl and saying, ""What the heck did I just see?"" It leaves you dumbstruck a little and you can just see that Al Pacino was a force to be reckoned with. Gene Hackman's best movie, if you ask me and just something to behold."
3,a sleeper movie,I first saw this movie when it came out. I thought then that the two actors did a remarkable job portraying two totally opposite charaters thrown together by circumstance. As their friendship grew and changed both of them in minute ways the drama increased. The ending is both touching and sad but realistic. Watching it again after over thirty years it still moved me.
2,Stick with earlier recordings,"Jazz does not lend itself to greatest hits. Especially when the artist has gone bad and is playing smooth jazz.Buy Last Tango, Bolivia, the Chapters, but not anything from Caliente on. It is ca-ca."
5,Now this is Fun,"Hi. This book is more than just funny. It's mind-achingly intelligent and exciting. Is it the story of a crazed serial-killer? Is it the story of a fat man with a photographic memory and a good imagination? I can't tell you, and I've read the...book twice now. But just because everything isn't spelled out for you doesn't make this a book to read, to ponder, and to enjoy. A lot of people hat Will Self because he's a self-agrandizing middle class [addict]. Me, I love him for it. He's smart. He's addictive. He's weird. And his books make you jump out of your skin with delight.Remember, reading Will Self makes you thirsty."
3,"""British Psycho""","With the verbal explosiveness of T.C. Boyle and a hand for the grotesque not duplicated since Bret Easton Ellis' ""American Psycho"", Self carves out new territory with this first novel. Where it fails though, is in its inability to break through the limitations of its brilliant and horrific prose to engender the reader with any sense of morality or meaning.What Ellis does so adeptly in ""American Psycho"", namely set a context to violence, Self all but disregards in his ""cautionary tale"". His attempts at portraying the evils of consumerism and capitalism fall well short of the mark. The reader gets the feeling that Self is so impressed by his own vocabulary and inventive prose that the story and its message have been all but forgotten."
1,Fantastically amateurish and timid,"Will Self's debut here in the USA was heralded with an avalanche of the most annoying kind of hype: the evocation of ""hipster"" novelists giving him their endorsement. He contrived to be photographed with Martin Amis--or at least menitoned in the same breath. Then came the novel. This novel. Oh, my heavens. Obviously it was delightful to discover just how timid a performance it is, especially after all the crap telling us we were going to be DEEPLY SCANDALIZED by the ""egdey"" Mr. Self's shocking world view. Boredom seeps from every page and sentence of this cautious, colorless, humorless disaster. I've never read another word the man has read and the very mention of his name puts me into a trance of boredom. But serve yourself, hipsters."
2,"Impish humor throughout, but the narrative is M.I.A....","This book has a trouserfuls of highbrow poo-poo humor, if that's your thing (and it can't be otherwise). And while some of it is indeed amusing, it mostly fails to fascinate the reader. It certainly doesn't shock, if that was the author's intention.And what happened to the story? I'm nearly half the way through and thinking things were off to a good start when suddenly the narrative gets lost in some rather dull cul-de-sacs and has to be airlifted to a hasty and unsatisfying finish!Still, not a bad piece of twentieth century fiction, but Martin Amis's praise led me to expect a bit more."
1,Boring and disappointing,"I've little to say about this book that hasn't been said better by previous reviewers. I actually came to this link to see what Amazon had to say about I book I found downright awful (kind of to test them). I was happy to see that the full-length review they included panned it. Good for them. As far as the book goes, it's just boring and bad. There are certainly plenty of good books with horrible or despicable protagonist/narrators--Pale Fire, Lolita, even Confederacy of Dunces (on a lighter note; dog-loving there, too, as I recall). This book just ain't one of them. Skip it."
2,"An Important Man, A Poor Biography -1.8 on a scale of 1 to 5","Hayek's life deserves-no demands- a biography of the highest order. I read Hayek in my studies in college and I was fascinated by his theories. He was a man who thought and wrote on profound economic issues.This biography, while seemingly well researched, does a disservice to the man. I (and a book club for an ivy league college) found it poorly written and structured. Sentences, paragraphs and thoughts collide.I would only recommend this book to diehard Hayek groupies (though it may cause pain). Individuals who want to learn more about him might benefit from skimming through the book. However, I would caution those individuals who seek out intelligent biographies of interesting people-that despite Hayek's very interesting life, this is not an intelligent biography worthy of him."
2,Only for diehard Wilkie Collins fans,"This book is definitely not another Woman in White or The Moonstone, both wonderfully well-written mysteries. For those who absolutely have to read every word that Collins wrote, this book is recommended. The plot is fairly boring and the characters fairly uninteresting. Overall, a slow and somewhat dull read."
2,Dave Lftin's Expert handicapping; Winning insights into Betting...,I like to handicap the races with a system. This book didn't have any so for me it wasn't very useful.
5,Nice book,"Delivered quickly to me. In the condition advertised.I really like this little book. It's written for young kids (6 or 7) with good basic reading skills. My daughter loves stories about ""real things"". This is a story about a young boy who is growing up on a real cattle ranch in Colorado. It's got photographs of the cowboys working for illustrations.I found out about this book from an article written by our NPR radio station KRCC. I live in Colorado Springs CO. This book was written by a local woman, and her photographer husband. This is a true story is about a local boy on a local ranch south of here. The boy grew up to run that ranch and who fought for ecologically sound ranching practices. He has passed on now, but his family continues his cause.I love reading a book to my kids that I can talk about.[...]"
1,Run away,These are as lifeless as they appear in the photo. No sparkle at all. I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase these. They did come in a timly manner. That is the only thing positive I can say.
4,It's Amazing That Governments Can Accomplish Anything,"A generally enjoyable and interesting book. I hold Dean Acheson in very high regard along with Harry Truman and George Marshall. As other reviewers have stated, those three men (and several others) initiated policies that shaped world history for the next 50 years.That said, the most fascinating aspect of the book for me was the back-stabbing, political posturing, stonewalling, and unresponsiveness that Acheson described throughout all the various government bureaucracies (both foreign and domestic) - Congress, the Defense Department, Foreign Ministries, Treasury, etc. It drives home to the reader just how difficult it is to get ANYTHING done in government! And it also reminds the reader that the political animosity and disfunction we see in modern government isn't a new phenomenon at all..."
2,Insomniac's delight,"If ""turgid"" and ""orotund"" describe your favorite books, you'll just love Secretary Acheson's memoirs. Understand, gentle reader, that I wanted to like this book. After all, Truman's biographers frequently quoted the secretary in brief, witty comments. Truman himself considered Acheson a genius.Mr. Acheson's own memiors, however, obscure the his many achievements, not to mention witticisms, with overly-detailed renditions of treaty negotiations. On the other hand, the author does provide insight onto many of the great characters of the era.In short, you have to be a dedicated something or other to finish, much less love this book."
4,One of the finest composers in jazz.,"This is the place to begin if you have never heard the unique compositions and piano style of Thelonious Monk. Most of his best known compositions are here. Even though these recordings were done for the most part in the 1960's, fifteen to twenty years after they were written, Monk was surrounded by a fine crew, particularly tenor sax player Charlie Rouse. These renditions are Hard Bop in style and while stellar sidemen such as John Coltrane are absent, this collection will familiarize you with the classic tunes. And should this wet your appetite, go to ""Brilliant Corners"" or ""Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane."" If not, well you needn't."
1,Safety hazard! This product should be banned!,"I've assembled two of these Elmo beds (I believe they are also available with other Sesame Street characters) and I can honestly say they are amongst the worst products I have ever seen (incidentally, I did not purchase either bed--one was a gift and the other was located at a family member's home). The instructions are terribly written, but more importantly the construction is shoddy and dangerous. The bed frame is made of multiple tubes of rolled sheet metal with punched-out holes to insert screws and cross tubes. However, the punched-out holes are often 1) poorly placed, resulting in cross-tubes fitting poorly or not at all, AND 2) occasionally not punched out entirely, resulting in sharp edges that can easily cause a deep cut.This product is a serious safety hazard and should be banned."
2,If you want to know LotusScript - this is not for you,"I expected much more on LotusScript than this book offered. I needed information and explanations. The title suggests it's all about LotusScript, but it's not. If you want some basic understanding of functions, domino and security, which is what this book offers, there are more helpful books out there."
4,Provides valuable cut & paste code & not avaiable elsewhere.,"Although not for the beginner, this text was straight forward. Goes beyond Lotus' explanation of this language. It provided solutions to some of my current LS issues...as well as the code-to-go. Great Reference!"
2,The title of this book is misleading,"I'd have to agree with the person from Sweden. This book didn't provide what the title seems to promise. It should be titled ""General Overview of Notes"". For someone wanting to dig into LotusScript I suggest Bill Kreisle's book ""Teach Yourself LotusScript for Notes/Domino 4.6"". Very Good."
2,Inside ? Where ?,"I bought this book because I want to understand LotusScript in details, but the book is very confuse and don't have a cronologic ""learning"" process... Was a spend of money.. In time, if want to understand LotusScript in ease (But not like a dummy way) purchase TY LotusScript!"
5,unbelievable sound and comfort with great style,"Loved the Naos. They match my Nano perfect, have really thick foam pads that block alot of exterior noise and are very comfortable and secure. But the best part is the sound. I didn't know my MP3 could sound so good. Great bass response. And they are supposed to protect my ears. Worth every penny."
1,Uncomfortable and poor sound,"The Ultrasone iCans are distinctly uncomfortable. The pressure is focused at the very tops of the outer ears, rather than evenly distributed over the outer ears. I would describe it as a stinging feeling at the tops of the ears. This of course is highly individual. Maybe people with smaller heads would find these more comfortable.The sound quality in the upper range is tinny. They sound like a cheap transistor radio. This is most evident with orchestral music. Maybe people who like the sound of these headphones are listening to non-acoustic music.They look rather odd when you wear them, because they stick out on the left and right sides at the hinges, where the fixed headband meets the parts that slide out. You won't notice this in photos taken from the side. I do not care for the over-stated branding on the earcups.In the same price range, the Sennheiser PX100 headphones sound better, are more comfortable, and look better. And they actually cost somewhat less."
2,sound great but uncomfortable,"When I bought these, I thought they were designed to fit behind the neck, but I don't believe that is the case, although that is the only semi-comfortable way of wearing them. When doing this, the wires point upward(not 90 degrees, but close), so I have to put the wires up over my head and behind the neck to keep them out of the way. They fold up neatly in the nifty traveling case they come in, and sound great, but I don't think I would have bought them knowing how they fit."
2,What a joke,"From the description on Amazon....Sleek design offers contemporary styling, amazing comfort (if you like tight head squeezing fit) and securityCompletely adjustable,( what adjustability, fits in the top of my ear not the center and their is no adjustment) these headphones fit snug on your head and have hinged arms that fold for safe transportation in stylish metal case. They do look good, but if you want to return them it will cost you shipping PLUS 15% restocking fee from the seller,DataVision Computer VideoNot quite worth the price to return them if you're going to lose $15 or more for headphone that are just average, but ""they do look good"".Sound quality is no better than my JVC 10 year old stereo headset. You can't move the top headband anywhere, because it is a solid piece of plastic with heavy tension to spring back in place.I guess the i cans come in a can because thats where they will spend most of their time."
1,returned item,"wow what a bad purchase this was. They are as non functional as they are hideous, and they are hideous. The sound quality was good, but anyone within earshot (which doesn't have to be far) can hear nearly at the same volume as the wearer. I returned these immediately and bought a pair of Bose, which I'm extremely happy with.Stay away."
3,Ultrasone for travelling,"I'm on the lookout for the ideal travel headset - 1) light & compact, 2) can use disposable batteries (or none at all), 3) is comfortable for long periods, 4) has a decent sound, and 5) has the ability to at least partially mask the ambient noise in a plane or train.I've tried units from Shure, Sony, Sennheiser, and Ultrasone. All meet, in different ways, 3 or 4 of the 5 criteria.The ultrasone is light, uses no batteries, has great sound, and is very comfortable. But, there is absolutely no noise dampening; the manufacturers don't claim this - I had just hoped.Until I find the right unit,I'm carrying my Shure ear buds and the Ultrasone with me on my flights. If anyone has suggestions - HELP!"
3,"Good, but some reservations","Garner's book was beautiful, reasonably written, but frankly I don't understand the concept, which he states as ""most unforgetable moments?"" Frankly I forgot most of the scenes on the DVD and in the book. I have seen them before but just didn't remember much about them at all. Also, Dustin Hoffman, a great actor, was terrible! He was dead-pan and a bore. He just did not project or add anything to the DVD program. Still the book was interesting, but room for improvement is all over the place. Frankly I think the author should stick to sports books, which did so well, I got two for Christmas. But I like old movies, so naturally I liked the book."
3,Cole's review age 7,You can make animal enclosures but after a while they start breaking down and then you have to dart all the animals which can be very tiring. There are some very cool new rollercoasters and some new thrill rides. There is a sandbox mode that allows you to play with an unlimited amount of money. You can make animal/ marine shows. The graphics and sound effects are great. Cole
3,Fun at first,"I was looking online one day and i found out a new expantion was coming out for rct3. I got very excited because i already have played rct3 soaked a million times. AS soon as got it, I installed it as quickly as i could and played for six hours striat. The next week, i popped in the disk aftr playing the game a lot to find out that it was getting boaring after a week! I found my self not making animals and animal shelters but building rollercoasters and pools.I would say to not get this game unless you are a hard-core rct3 gammer like me. I loved it because of the new coasters and not the animals. So buy this game if you are looking for more features and rollercoasters but if your buying it for the animals, DONT BUY IT!"
4,Wild about Wild,The game has got it all now that Wild has been added. The only problem i have with any of the RCT games is in night time mode. My computer tends to slow signifigantly because there is so much going on. But i don't care - I'm having way too much fun. i somedays spend 3 - 6 hrs. just building parks. I'm thoroughly addicted.
4,A Brilliant Expansion to an already great game,"I originally had the rollercoaster tycoon 3 gold game, which was the rct soaked expansion along with the base game. When I was looking through the internet I found this expansion pack. I decided to get it and it is still working brilliantly"
2,just okay,"This microscope is just one step above a toy microscope, in my opinion. Granted, my husband and I are used to lab quality microscopes (and we knew for the price it wouldn't be lab quality!) However, we were disappointed. We purchased it for our daughter and it didn't quite live up to our expections. It isn't a sturdy/solid microscope, and you can't see very clearly or in great detail. I would say just ""okay"" for a young, budding scientist."
2,Projector hood doesn't function correctly.,"I bought this item to project larger pictures of coins to detirmine if there were defects not visible to the naked eye. I can view a coin fine through the eye piece by adding light to the surface. I cannot project anything or see anything in the projector hood. I don't know if mine is just defective or what, but, there appears to be no available web site to ask questions. Maybe it can be returned but if you are looking for this feature in a cheap plastic microscope I would pass this one up."
3,Kid's Starter Microscope is Okay...,"It is a pretty good starter microscope for a child. I was surprised how little slides it came with. We were a little frustrated because we had to really search to find out how to put in the batteries and make the light turn on. This microscope did not come with any instructions. The microscope itself is fun because once you figure out how to focus it, the slides look really cool. There were no descriptions of the specimen that were given to put on the blank slides. When you open the bottle. There was so very little of each specimen that you really did need a microscope to find it. Also for a child, they spill more than what was given. Also the carrying case is really cheaply made and does not hold things securely when opening and closing. Overall we were pleased with the microscope itself, but if you purchase it you need to already know how a microscope works, be prepared to buy seperate slides to use with it and consider purchasing a better carrying case."
1,Poor optical quality,"This scopes is not up to standard at all. If you are looking for a toy, there are much cheaper option. If you are hoping to kindle your kids' interest in science with this scope, forget it!! The optical quality is very poor. Also, you can only get a some what clear image from the projector if you hold the paper within 2 inches from the projector. My son and I wasted a whole month waiting for this scope to arrive, and we have decided to return it after using it for less than an hour."
2,Kid's Stuff,This product is nowhere close to a professional Microscope though it is ok for the price at which it is available. The lenses are decent quality and it seems sturdy enough to be used by a child.
4,Not Bad,This Microscope is not bad. The only thing I would let everyone know is the projector doesnt work so great. Otherwise nice item for the price.
3,For a budding scientist,It's not perfect...but I guess for the price it is still a good deal. My daughter really is into science and she was excited to get this. She spends lots of time looking at the limited items that came with it...but we combined some slides from her dad's old microscope set to really increase the items she gets to study. The great thing is this upcoming school year (4th grade) she is going to be using microscopes at school. I know with the additional knowledge she will get at school this will be coming out even more. So it's going to be great to reinforce what she is learning.
5,T5Alive,Loved the product and the features. It had some cool accessories I did not even expect to get. Great starter set.
2,Not As Good As Expected,"This is not the best Microscope I have seen and really it is just a toy.The included projector is innovative, but useless & the quality of the images is not that great.If you are looking for a nice Microscope for your kids (like mine who is intrigued by such items) spend more money on something decent."
1,Galileo 1200x Power Microscope - No Good,"Poor product, fuzzy, blurry optics, Amazon had this item listed for $49 new but when other vendors advertize this item, the price goes up to $119. Don't waste your money, go to another brand, anything but this particular product."
1,"More Books, More Ties, Mugs and Sweaters...... MiniRUSH","Again, as with Coulter and Savage, the youth movement of the RIGHT steps up to the plate for their cause....... and who is left when they're done....... no one other than those who think as they do......Hannity at least exhibits some skills and he does make some points, but to have the ""we are right and they are wrong"" attitude from cover to back is a little trying on those of us who want to be somewhat open minded.The title is insulting and the text at times is mindless..... perhaps Hannity has taken a book from the Limbaugh School for Conservative Thinking...... get it now, get it quick and move onto the next issue that you can commercialize for profit....I hope Hannity is a little more open minded next time around..."
1,when man assumes his role as Biased God,"It is sad that for business cause a human being assumes himself in position of god.A Biased god ,who creates hate in day to day life,only provides half picture of the story and mutliates facts in favor of ill willed argument.However, he can be a good example if somebody wanna make money this way.He is one more example of misusing mass media in his shows as well as his print.Before reading this book if you have read Bias -ISBN: 0895261901 ,you will feel how correct writer of Bias was.If you have read tis book first,correct your emotions created in wrong direction,read Bias."
1,Nothing New To Offer,"Much of what is written in this book has been written before in other (and better) books by Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Dinesh D'Suasa, William Bennett, the list goes on. Since this basically a re-hash of more astute commentators, it's just not very interesting."
2,"File under ""Paid-For""","Well-written but morally bankrupt blah-blah From the same sludge pile that coughed up Anne Coulter. Once again, simplification serves to demonize and lay all fault on those troublesome human bugaboos called ambiguity and compassion. The glorification of smug self-centeredness and I've-got-mine-hell-with-you disguised as patriotism is just disgusting. When will America take off their blinders and see these pillagers for who they are?Defending freedom and championing the cause of every man being accountable for himself does not necessitate abandoning one's senses to this kind of inflammatory junk. These same people would crucify the man again if he bothered to return. In their eyes, he was weak."
1,Horrifically dishonest,There's something very insidious about someone who would lie so deliberately and so desperately. It makes me ashamed to be an American....
2,great book,"this is the greatest book ever written, everything he wrote is the truth and its simply great. moore sucks"
1,Radio Noise on Paper,"It always amazes me how these neo-fascist nuts always talk about ""values"" and ""freedom"" but they are always trying to establish a police state; dictating what you should think and how you should behave in your own bedrooms. What's worse, radio stations hire these human bullhorns to go on air and spout their vitriolic nonsense across this country. Their ideas are the only ideas, peace through war, freedom through oppression, etc....And now we have ""the hottest new phenomenon"", sheesh. Any child can get on the radio and/or write a book expousing their paranoia, hypocracy and isolationist viewpoints, its easy to be arrogant and close-minded. Why would any American want to support these cretins by buying one of their books is beyond me."
2,Best Book Ever? Kidding?,"First of all, political pundits can rarely produce good writing. It is their ideas people find enticing, so just admit it that this book is poorly written and you just like Hannity's ideas. Second, why are opinion books so popular? Form your own opinions. Conservatives that need to buy books by Hannity and Coulter are intellectually dependent on pundits to affirm their own values. If you're one of those people that read newspapers, forms an opinion on an issue, then turns on Hannity-Radio to make sure that his opinions jive with yours (and then change your own opinion because Hannity has a different one)...then you should buy this book. If you read a newspaper and form your own opinions without needing someone to tell you that your ideas are A-OK, then don't buy this book."
1,Divide and Conquer,"Why is does it always have to be one or the other? The whole premise of this book is to stoke the fires of the far right while leaving no room for any debate or gray area. Give me a break! The far right isn't any better at being a good American than the far left. Both sides are so blind in their belief that they fail to see the forest for the trees. I think I am like most Americans who when really looking at our political parties see that I am not represented well by either.This is by design folks. How could we possibly have any power as a people if we are always divided and arguing with each other. Meanwhile our Government(Corporation) goes about its business of taking our money and freedoms by controlling your thoughts through their ever increasing P.R. and ... network.Back to the book. I thought it was an entertaining read and very funny at times, but that's just me."
1,"Same Old, Same Old",After reading this book twice I realized that it's just more of the same old conservative right wing mumbo jumbo and double talk. And they say liberals whine! Page after page after page of mindless moaning that grabs the wrong end of the stick and procees to beat around the bush with it. At least Rush makes me laugh (even though I don't agree with him). Recommended only for the ultra rich.
5,Great book Sean - great savings at Costco too,"I picked up a copy of Let Freedom Ring at Costco earlier today. Great book---could hardly put it down. It was great to see that our Costco has replaced The Price of Loyalty and American Dynasty with Sean's books Let Freedom Ring, Deliver Us From Evil and John Podheretz book, Bush Country.In Let Freedom Ring, I found it interesting how Clinton/Gore let our military fall apart. No wonder terrorists attacked us so viciously on 911. They figured we wouldn't have the military power to defend ourselves. Thank God for GWBII.Let Freedom Ring is an OUTSTANDING book. Highly recommended along with Deliver Us From Evil and Bush Country."
1,"Awful, Unpatriotic, Dishonest","Sean and his friends at Fox are not true conservatives. They are radical right-wing hystericals. This idiot screamed ""wag the dog"" whenever Clinton went after terrorists in Afganistan, thus weakening the United States and helping leave us open to future terror attacks. Like 9-11.We're never going to be safe and prosperous until we all learn to tune out the hate-mongers and discuss different opinions like sane adults.Just say no to this book."
1,Laughably Bad,"Hannity chastises liberals for moral relativism and promotes moral absolutes. But who defines the absolutes? Everything isn't black and white, as Hannity believes. He also invokes our ""founding fathers"" with a sort of spiritual reverence, without really discussing that their idea of ""democracy"" allowed voting only by land-owning males. This is but one example of how notions of ""right"" and ""wrong"" have shifted over time, as no enlightened person would dare suggest today that minorities, non-land owners or women shouldn't have the right to vote. The converted (i.e., fans of Hannity's radio show) may love this book, but those with an open mind aren't likely to be convinced by Hannity's sense of logic."
1,A big dissapointment,"The more that I read Hanity and listen to his radio show, the more that I realize that he doesn't represent conservatives. He generally has his facts right. But he makes huge quantum leaps from facts to conclusions. His book is a big opportunity for him to whine about Clinton. Sure, Clinton was a joke, but don't waste two chapters complaining about him. The real reason that I am down on Hanity is because he doesn't respect people who have diferent viewpoints. As a result, he is absolutely no fun to hear or watch on TV. He is not sincere and it shows. He makes people feel uncomfortable and is rude. Yes, the liberal agenda bothers me too. However, Hanity is not an eloquent spokesman for anyone. He had better make his money now because his popularity will be short lived, given his delivery. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,"WOW, what a poorly informed, highly paid nimrod","Good luck, dear reader, with a body of work that will long live as the biggest load of biased political claptrap this side of Mein Kempf. Do not buy this but remain informed by loaning it from the library. Then come back, read all 464 reviews and cringe that people find this mess worthwhile."
5,On Target,"Great insights, well written book that once again exposes the liberal agenda to tear this great country apart. The one star morons are out in force to try and discredit Sean with their reviews but that's the way they work, don't debate just insult."
2,A Patriot?,"I am always sceptical of people who wrap themselves in the flag and using it as a backdrop on this book cover should have set off alarms in my mind before I bought.I find it particularly offensive the comments he makes about JFK. This man was seriously injured serviing his country in one of the most dangerous war time jobs, then stood firm against the Communists in the Cuban Crisis.Wearing the flag makes you as much a patriot as wearing a 49ers shirt makes you a quarterback."
2,Partisan mediocrity,"I didn't expect much from a political hack like Hannity, and I wasn't disappointed. There's no actual need to read this book, as I can sum it up for you in four words: Republicans good, Democrats bad. (In my view, 50% correct). Hannity simply puts forth the Republican, pro-Bush party line on every issue. Everything he says is predictable. Don't waste your time on this book. If you want a real conservative viewpoint, try reading something from Pat Buchanan or Joe Sobran."
1,Facts matrix built on sand,"Like all neo con's who are actually anti conservative Hanity will grab whatever will stick to the wall to support his rants. Adept at times at the art of half truth, he counts on people too lazy to check facts or who will work to become informed from muliple credible sources of information so they can develop their own opinion. The last demographic Hanity depends on for support, willingly stupid people, a demographic that has saddly grown even into the White House."
4,Not Bad,Interesting read but Ann Coulter pretty much covers the same material with a bit more of an edge which makes the reading a bit more enjoyable for me.
4,Great!,"I am very impressed with the easy read. I try to get the more conservative views out of books, television and radio since the media continues to provide only one side (left). I find Hannity's view coincides with the majority of America who may be muffled under a liberal hand. I highly recommend this book to all those who want to hear how America is great. God Bless America and God Bless Sean Hannity!"
1,RUBBISH!!!,"This book is trash which only ignorant rednecks from the states will enjoy. I suggest reading Al Franken's ""LIES AND THE LYING LIARS WHO TELL THEM"" for a supurb and entertaining critique of this work."
1,More Hannity than anyone on this planet could handle,"This book could have been written by Dennis Miller, because all Hannity does is RANT!When I first saw this book, I thought I would read it to find out what Hannity would do to make this country better, even though, after seeing his show, one can see that he has not ideas of his own.Besides, he spends 99% of the time ranting about how Democrats and Liberals want to destroy the country (which no one wants to do), instead of admitting that they have a point of view different to his and then express why he thinks they are wrong.While everyone should get together to try to make this country a better place, Hannity keeps bashing everyone who might dare oppose his views. Sean GROW UP!"
1,Great if you enjoy lies,"Hannity is a moron in the vein of Limbaugh, quite a legacy to follow. This book is great if you enjoy reading about a hypocrite who criticized kosovo but then denigrated anyone who criticized Iraq as anti-american. Another product of Republican party organ Fox News Channel, Hannity is one of the great liars on television today. Lie Sean Lie!"
4,Let Freedom Ring!!!,"Upon finishing this book, I could only give 4 stars. Mainly due to Sean's ""full of himself"" attitude. If he plugs the ""Hannity & Colmes"" show once, he plugs it a thousand times. However, the views expressed and the information given indeed will enable the right to do battle with the left. Alot of insight to the far left liberals agenda for a socialistic country. Of which ALL AMERICAN'S cannot allow to happen. Makes for good ""round table"" discussions at dinner time. Esspecially on the topic of today's educational system. (Even my liberal wife who is a teacher agree's with Sean on this particular subject)Sean Hannity delivers his opinions and facts with an ""America: Love It or Leave It"" approach and stays the course till the very end."
2,Hits the Nail on the Head!,"This book hits the nail on the head! We must not forget the past and learn from it or it is destined to be repeated. All this talk of America the Imperialists sounds all too familiar from the Reagan era. Remember how Reagan was supposed to start WW3 and end the world?? Well, look how it turned out...He cleaned up Carter's mess and lifted America back up and changed the world.The Democrats, if they have their way, will return the country to our weakened ways of old......"
1,hannity dumbs it down for the dumbies,"ahh, if only everything were as simple as hannity would have us believe. in hannity's world, ""liberals"" are the root of all that is wrong with the country. this simplistic view is delivered on every issue... exactly like with his mentor rush. hannity's words are served up in this simplistic fashion for the ""nascar dads"" of the country who will buy anything wrapped in a flag. this is not real political analysis. this is purposefully designed and marketed entertainment news for the ignorant masses. please.. put down the hannity, read something that isn't 100% biased and wreaking of jingoism."
1,What an idiot ...,A friend gave me this book to read and once I had it opened it was like I was reading bathroom walls at school. I felt like I was reading something that a schoolyard bully had wrote. Enough of these BS books ... waste of my time and waste of money. Take him off the air and off the bookshelves.
1,Can you count the falacies,"While reading Hannity's book I came across many falacies. I;m not surprised by them since they would be there if a liberal wrote a book but they should be pointed out. First of all Sean goes off on Clintons cheating without mentioning the number of Republicans that had extramarital affairs. He calls Clinton a scumbag for pergery while he hails Poindexter a hero who also pergered himself before congress. He mentions Linda Cahvez and Pete Wilson and their views on immigration without mentioning their own use of illegal immigrants for work. He says that liberals are wrong to say they're pro-choice, shouldnt conservatives be wrong to say they're pro life when they support the death penalty? Finally he mentions how Fox News is balanced and fair, this is coming from the same station whose reporter (Riveira) lied about his reporting in Afghanistan. It wouold be nice to find a real balanced book and one that is slanted to one political side."
1,Makes a nice paperweight,"More ... from .... I question almost everything in this book. This guy thinks he represents the views of society, he couldn't be more mistakened. I just wish people will see through the ..."
1,Demagogues Strike Again!,"So, essentially, this book's argument is that 9/11 was really the fault of liberals. How convenient. :)The basic problem I have as a libertarian with conservatives like Hannity is that they are as much anti-liberty as so-called liberals are. They sponsor socialism when it comes to issues of morality and also economic exchanges they happen to disfavor. What they want isn't really liberty - they want a world where people are free to do what they want them to do. Because they've wrapped themselves in words like liberty, they've hollowed out the term to meet their ideology. Its rather sad that this has come to pass, but so be it. Anyway, Hannity isn't committed to ""freedom"" so much as he is committed to his rather simple answers that the world throws at him. Which of course makes hima good right-wing poster boy for the folks at Fox News, but it doesn't make him an advocate of freedom.Flame On! :)"
1,Hannity lost,"I was watching Hannity and Colmes last night and saw something pretty hilarious,he went to the Democratic National Convention and was interviewing some comediand actress woman(I can't remember her name), this is how it went.Hannity:Do you think Bush lied about IraqWoman:yesHannity:are you voting for KerryWoman:yesHannity:But Kerry also believed there were WMD in IraqWoman:I know, Bush gave him bad IntelHannity:But they have not found WMD, does that mean kerry was lyingWoman:no, he was given bad IntelHannity:but would that not make kerry a liarWoman:by calling kerry a liar when he originally agreed with bush, are you saying that bush is also a liar?Hannity:ummm(ignores answer and 15 seconds later cuts to commercial)This is a great example of Sean Hannity, ignoring an answer after he was wrong and trying to BS his way through with rapid fire questions, do not get anything he writes it will be completely biased with half-truths."
1,"Dear god, such claptrap.",Wow. This one is dreadful. At least Talib-Ann Coulterhas the benefit of being enetertaining in her fiction. Hannity is just overly earnest and underly-informed or verified.
1,More Nonsensical Right Wing Propoganda,"Come out the herd & be heard my fellow Americans. Can you appreciate the distinction? Am I a ""commie"" because I believe in the power of compassion over conflict and cooperation over competition? If so, Jesus was a ""commie"" too! The God so many of you right wing fanatics supposedly believe in. How can you belive in him if you don't believe in justice, fairness & common decency too? Wake up America its time to humble ourselves and right the wrongs we have committed in our addiction to infinite greed and selfishness.Children should not die so your fat asses can ride around in SUVs."
3,How can anyone take this kind of book seriously?,"I usually don't waste my money on books like this, but I guess I was just possessed when I bought it. Thank heavens I waited until it came out in paperback.Regardless of political affiliation, talking heads like Sean Hannity, especially when trying to defend the indefensible, tend to be very selective when picking facts, so they can bend them to meet their own ends. This is all well and good, except for when people on the other side of the political fence start deconstructing what they write and exposing the holes within. The fact that I don't agree with Sean Hannity's opinions just makes me notice it more easily with right-wing manifestos.I would recommend this book to anyone to read, as long as he or she would also read an equally fiery liberal book from someone like Molly Ivins or Michael Moore."
1,Waste of Money,"Typical of this author-a book full of his ""wisdom"". Please don't waste your money on this. It isn't worth sll the hype"
1,Get Sanitized - Avoid Hypocrite Hannity - He's Hateful,"I struggled through this book, amused at the way in which Sean jumps to conclusions. Man, this narrow minded man is a hypocrite of biblical proportions! Read the book if you must, but go into it with the knowledge that Sean exagerates the facts and jumps to conclusions based on faulty research. This country is in real trouble if the majority falls for this kind of drivel."
1,An honest opinion,"After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price)."
2,College drop out should go back to school,"Wow! What an unbelievable read! I am not surprised that Hannity is a college dropout, because if he handed this book in to a Prof. he would get it thrown straight back at him for out and out lies! I did however, give this 2 stars, quiet simply because I laughed my [tush] off! God Bless Hannity and God Bless America!"
1,Fantabulous!,"Steve Hammerhands has done it again! With his enlarged forehead and pre-historic facial features, many speculated that Steve would never be able to communicate with the rest of society. Now he co-hosts his own TV show (opposite a piece of marzipan candy affectionately called ""Alan""), hosts his own radio show, and has even written a book! Granted, he speaks in an unintelligible series of grunts and whistles, and his writing looks like something that a first grade remedial writing teacher would give an 'F' to, but that's beside the point. The real story here is that the Unfrozen Caveman Political Hack is here to stay!!!"
1,Time wasted,"Another sorry, under-researched tome by a bigoted extremist who mistakenly believes that the talent for preaching to the already-converted at high volume translates into the ability to write coherently."
1,do you like him?,Did I hear someone say 'intelligence'? The guy should go back to high school and review his civilization and humanity course.
2,Nice landing; Wrong airport,"While Mr. Hannity effectively evokes his radio/tv persona in this book he does little to further ""the cause"" that he so passionately embraces. All this book seems to focus upon is the demonization of the left. The truly offensive aspect is the consistent need to equate liberalism with socialism. JFK, Jimmy Carter, Hubert Humphrey, and Walter Mondale - all LIBERAL DEMOCRATS that served their country VOLUNTARILY with valor when it counted - it is disgraceful to defile their accomplishments. Mr. Hannity would be better served taking a few years off the circuit and rounding out his obviously limited education before his political aspirations become too transparent."
1,If I could give half a star I would...,"Hannity's lack of balance is quite amazing, he seems blissfully ignorant of much of the evidence against his viewpoints."
5,Great Book,Sean is yet another talented and informed conservative hero and brings so much insight into the wrongs and the end justify the means committed by the socialist marxist liberal left.
2,Another disappointment,"Sean Hannity is no help to the right-wing cause. This is important to consider, because if you plan on spitting out his arguments verbatim, you should realize the quality of his book does not rise to the level of what he does on the radio.The book is merely Sean Hannity spewing invective about his hatred for Bill Clinton. Just as he does on the radio, Sean will defend any point or any issue labeled ""conservative"", even if it means advocating the death of panda bears and hanging children from trees. Some of his arguments are just plain silly, and I didn't find any of the chapters to provide great new logic. Furthermore, the book is no great literary wonder; it reads like a transcript of Hannity & Colmes with Colmes edited out."
4,Good advice,"Few people are willing to 'stick their necks out' when it comes to letting their political convictions known. Sean is no coward, and tells it like he sees it, letting go with 'both barrells'. A good reminder of what is to come and what to do about it."
1,"Foolish, angry, spitefull man: Sean Hannity","War on liberalism? War of liberty? How can we equate these two things? Who is the real bad guy here? Dangerous propaganda, read it and judge for yourself."
5,Conservative policies and politics defined.,"This book should be the official guide to conservative policies and politics. Sean Hannity beautifully covers every major political topic from abortion to educational system failures, defense spending, foreign oil dependence, and everything in between. Sean presents the conservative case in a compelling and easy to follow and understand format, highlighting the bias of the left. Given the nature of the book, it's hard to imagine it as a real 'page turner', but Sean has done exactly that. This book nearly turns the pages itself."
1,Rather shameless piece of nonsense,"I am a conservative and enjoy reading many conservative writers. However, I have never enjoyed the writings of such people like Hannity or Limbaugh. The reason is, they are not really conservatives. They want fame and influence. They want to put ideas in the heads of people that quite often don't have any there to begin with. They package it in the form of patriotism, but in reality, it is just egomaniacal. They are Joe McCarthy and Charles Coughlin. GOP Shills and Commerical Opportunists. They do not make well thought out observations. They attempt to smear and spit venom. They simplify ideas so as to gear their message towards the uninformed. As a result, they become the prophets for the ignorant masses. I wonder if any of these so-called ""conservatives"" have really spent time reading the works of historical conservative figures. My kids gave me this book because they thought I would like it. Instead, I felt like I was reading a comic book."
1,What a disappointment,"I'm ashamed Hannity stands in front of the American flag as he simultaneously disenfranchises working America, the poor and people of color. Save your money."
1,Another killed tree for the waste of paper!!!!!!,"Interesting to see fundamentalists at work!just the same ideology that drives terrorists Sean!There is a huge difference between patriotism andone sided chauvinism. The writer is right about onething though liberalism is evil. But so is hisethnocentric right winger style of freedom.Thank God I borrowed the book from a library!!!!!!!!My advice, You could do the same"
1,Drivel by Sean Hannity,"This book was given to me so I can't say that I wasted my money on it. My title for Mr. Hannity's book is very forgiving for its content.There are no new ideas or rhetoric here, not even for a White Power person such as Mr. Hannity. He had one point that he repeated over and over and that is that all the problems in the world are caused by the ""Left"". He did not define who the Left are so that was a little disappointing. The other disapoinnting thing is that Mr. Hannity never learned the word ""parsimony"", but then again it must be hard for him becasue his vocabulary numbers less then 2000 words."
1,Mean-spirited drivel,"Small of mind and crippled in spirit, the only war Hannity really wants to fight is against human decency. If you find yourself in agreement with him, can I have your car after the Rapture?"
1,Since when is liberty a conservative ideal?,"I don't mind so much that Hannity is extremely self-righteous; most ultra-conservatives, and ultra-liberals in fact, are. What makes me mad is that he insists America was founded on conservative principles of freedom, liberty, and Judeo-Christian values (by which, of course, he means Christian values). In fact, when the Constitution was written, democracy was an extremely liberal idea. At the time, monarchy was the trend in most ""civilized"" countries, and with the Constitution, America became the first democracy since ancient Greece. Of course, today, democracy has become much less liberal since the rise of socialism. Hannity forgets that the ideals he defends were once radically liberal."
1,Should be listed under fiction...,Hannity is about as fair as a French olympic judge and as balanced as the Leaning Tower of Pisa...it wasn't enough that his partisan hyperbole and outright lies pollute the radio and TV airways twice a day for 4 hours (what liberal media figure gets equal time?) but he had to write a book espousing his supposed love for America but his hate of Americans...PS: Hannity...Justin Volpe is still guilty...
1,Hate-speech,"Continuing the ridiculous rhetoric of war and battle against such a complex phenomenon as terrorism, Hannity assumes that given enough napalm, Agent Orange and laser guided missles, terrorism will cease to exist. Unfortunately, in his blatant and transparant parochialism he has negelected the lessons learned by other nations facing terrorist threats. But of course simplistic opinions without rational reasoning is not just easier to write, but - unfortunately - these days also easier to sell."
1,"SEAN, THE PATRIOT","sean would never go to war! he wouldn't because he feels his idiology precludes him and his generation from having to fight war. instead he and the right wing conservatives (small ""r"", small ""c"") advocate sending young AMERICANS (large ""A"") to fight for oil and big business. he may speak for the ""me too"" crowd, but he and limbaugh and o'reilly have not walked the walk. they merely talk the talk. he's nothing more than a redneck who all of sudden has found himself in the spotlight. care to reply?..."
2,You either have to love this guy or hate him...,"You either have to love this guy or hate him, what he has to say I mean...As for me by the 2 Star Review posted above, guess you can see how I feel about what this dofis has to say. Hey, opinons are like ...everyone has one! Mr. Hannity has lost his ability for deductive reasoning. (I gave this book '2' Stars instead of '1' because I like Mr. Dofis's smile on the cover of the book."
1,What Freedom?,"There is no freedom in America since George Dubya assumed power, hes been taking our powers away and its people like Mr. Hannity who do this. Where's Lee Harvey Oswald when you need him?"
1,A Pig Defends His Sty,"The issue is not liberal vs conservative. The issue is progressive vs reactionary. Burning people at the stake and royalty walking on the backs of peasants may be Sean Hannity's vision of the future, but it certainly isn't mine. This grunt munching pig already makes too much money. Don't buy this rag."
1,Better than you Sean,"Three things make me better than Sean Hannity:1) I was actually in the US Military2) I graduated college, unlike Sean3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America.Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans.Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion."
4,Not Bad,Interesting read but Ann Coulter pretty much covers the same material with a bit more of an edge which make the reading a bit more enjoyable for me.
1,Propaganda served up cold,"Apologist, Propagandist, Lying Wimpy limp fisted crap, served up in a ham fisted sandwich like yesterdays news. Less interesting, less fun, less humour, less insight, less subtle, than the five o'clock follies, only less truthful. Less informative than a broken watch, Hannity is NEVER right. He's just on the RIGHT, and like the rest of the Lemmings and that idiot Coulter, he's headed over a cliff. Good Bye, Good Night, and Good riddenceJeff Gannon (Reformed in Washington)"
1,Hannity never even served his country! He knows nothing.,"Remember that fat and insecure pathetic bully brat in Junior High school? ... Well, it's kinda like that.Listening to this boy speak in unnerving, yes, but reading him is a different story. Seriously, all I can do if feel sorry for him. I feel like his mental deficiency is being exploited for our entertainment. I also feel guilty laughing so much at him.For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, amen? I don't get it. He thinks he has all the answers, and he is a god or something. I don't think I have ever heard or seen an interview of his where the other person actually talks... so his books are about the same.Poor thing."
1,Wolf in lamb's clothing,"This man is just plain evil. He's dishonest and his followers are sadly misled. I'm conservative and I hate what he is doing to conservatives. The book is classic Hannity with half truths and dishonest misleading of his followers. PLEASE check out what he says and make him be honest with his asserions. And PLEASE, Sean, stop the ""let not your heart be troubled"" words of Jesus (let not your heart be troubled, you believe in the Father, believe also in me). WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING. Nothing more!"
2,Seen it all before,"Can these people from Fox come up with anything unique. I give him one star on top of the minimum because he's carrying out his obvious dream of making a bunch of money and he's doing it by selling the same old boring ideas to the people who already believe it. This is not going to convince a single person to change their views on anything. Reagen=good, Clinton=bad, there is nothing else. I find it funny how, as with music, politicians become popular on a 20 year cycle. Perhaps we can better remember the good in things that happened 20 years ago.Overall, a very boring predictable book with no insight and no value."
1,Should be embarassed to call himself a Christian,"Mr. Hannity speaks a lot about his Christian values but I wonder what Bible he's reading. My Bible teaches tolerance, compassion and love of one's fellow man, whereas this man seems to practice the opposite. I am not his judge but it seems the word ""hypocrite"" could easily apply. As a devout Christian, I am appalled and sickened by this type of mean-spirited, hateful individual purporting to hold the same values I do. He doesn't. He should be ashamed of himself... assuming he has any shame at all."
1,trashhh,"very efficient book, I used it as toilet paper. Hannity don't forget snowball. next one is coming.He claims to be a Patriot , yet hatred of the govt and the President is everywhere."
3,"Not his best!, for More insight read Larry Elder","Mr. Hanity is currently the conservative pundit of the moment.However, In many ways his conservativism does not go far enough. He talks about Truman and FDR as though they were both moderates (which they most certainly were not).Second, he is not a strong enough supporter of libertarian principles particularily the reduction of government regulation, deregulating the health care system, and getting the federal government out of the education business.For those seeking to read about a real conservative look no further than Larry Elder.This book is best for those whose prevailing concern is the decline of Judeo-Christian principles as opposed to those looking for a discussion of real fiscal and monetary reforms."
1,How could Hannity be so incredibly obnoxious?,"TeamFranken hit the nail on the head in Franken's book Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them. I learned a new word from reading Hannity's book:ad hominemadjectiveappealing to emotions: appealing to people's emotions and beliefs rather than their ability to think ( formal )[Late 16th century. From Latin, ""to the person.""]ad hominem adverbThanks for the wisdom Mr. Hannity!"
4,Strong entry into the print field,"What a surpise. Like any work of political non-fiction, half the people give this book 5 stars and half give it 1. Can we put partisan politics aside- if you don't like what Hannity has to say, don't post a review. I doubt you even read the book. The same goes for Republicans, don't unnecessarily trash Al Franken's stuff when you didn't read the book. Let's get fair evaluations.As for Hannity's tome, it was a good read. I considered Ann Coulter's ""Slander"" better, but this is also a good book for those wanting to saturate themselves in the conservative mantra."
1,"Hannity's ""BLAH BLAH BLAH..Freedom..BLAH BLAH BLAH...""","My actual rating would be Zero stars, but the lowest you can go is one.The whole book is just one big obnoxious and dishonest attempt that is meant to mislead the reader to conclude that it all the librels fault. I do not know what is worse in this book, the missinformation or the out right lies.The way the author puts his material together is kind of typical right-winger slanderers put together any false arguments. By putting up a straw man arguments to hold the opposing views that he crafts as the 'Democrats' and then easily tears it down.For instance, he embelishes in one point that ""They tell us that fuel-burning SUV's are bad for America, but flag burning SOB's aren't""You see what I mean, this is typical of the entire book."
5,Breath of Fresh Air,"I was given this book as a gift. I found it refreshingly filled with common sense ideas. I must say that some days when I watch the news or read op/ed columns I feel like I must have woken up on some alien planet with alien ideas and screwed up values; certainly not the America I grew up in. This book speaks to that stronger, saner and more respectful and civil America that I miss. What we have today is not a melting pot anymore, but a rancid salad...with ingredients that don't work together. Good job, Mr. Hannity, I thank God there are still a few voices of sanity left in this country. I hope it's enough, but I fear it's not. Sometimes I think I hear Nero fiddling while Rome burns."
5,A Great Truthful Read,"Instead of becoming like the person who calls Sean ""Mr Inanity"" and then tell me that this book comes from someone who is sophmoric (Like the pot calling the kettle black) or coming on to just personally attack and call Sean Hannity names, I feel this book actually deserves a review. This is a well written book, which Sean Hannity has actually backed up with FACTS. Unlike the books and materials that are put out by the left (Al Franken, Moore, etc) that are scathing attacks and pieced together propaganda, this book actually has a purpose to allow you to truthfully think about many things in todays political world, no matter where you lie in the political spectrum. The reason why this book is being panned by liberals is because it showcases their faults and makes people realize what their motives really are. If you are someone who is intellectually honest no matter what your political affiliation is, purchase this book and read it, you will enjoy!"
5,"nothing but the truth, with facts to back up every point","Never mind the spin doctors in the media who hit you with 20 second sound bites, this in depth commentary clearly illustrates what is wrong with this country and who got us to where we are. It highlights true heroes and also reminds us of the dark ages in morality aka The Clinton Years. Read this book and you will know who ""Clinton Cool Aid drinkers"" really are!"
1,Horrible book!,"This books clearly exeplifies the how utterly senseless these ultra conservative writers have become. It's clear that Sean Hannity, Ann Coutler, Laura Ingraham, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage and so on are simply out to make a career out of bashing liberals and Democrats. I've skimmed most of their books and it's sickening, to various degrees, how they don't back up their statements in a sound manner. The level of misrepresentation is astounding. It's okay to disagree with ""liberals"", but the discourse should at least rise above the 1st grade level, something beyond calling liberals stupid traitors. I hope this liberal bashing fad ends soon but I doubt it will.word,-john"
5,Book Purchase,"Received quickley, in excellent condition. The book is an excellent read, even for Democrats."
4,Makes a few good points,"I agree a lot with what he said, more than I thought I would,especially regarding those who view moderate expressions of patriotism as bad. Civil disgreement is one thing, but insults are another. I only dislike it when he starts to get personal with the other side."
1,blah blah blah,"If you're going to waste your time reading non-sensical conservative rhetoric, you might as well read Limbaugh. Hannity may be the next big thing in the conservative media but his ideas seem toe the Republican line very neatly, with no new insights. The book basically amounts to ""Conservative Good, Liberal Bad"" in keeping with the simplistic views of the president. Maybe a book written by a conservative who's not a right-wing nut would be worth reading but this is not it. Very poor!"
1,A huge disappointment,"I'm a political conservative and agree with Hannity's position on many important issues. So, unlike many who've panned his book because they disagree with his political ideology, I'm panning his book simply because it's poorly written.Simply put, Let Freedom Ring is a dull read. And Hannity's pedantic and overbearing style are to blame. Reading the book reminded me of those times in college where I registered for what should have been extremely interesting courses, only to find myself bored to tears because of how the professor treated the material.Hannity is a fine radio/TV host. He should stick to what he's good at. Next time he should hire a ghost writer."
1,"total, complete fabricated idiocy","Either this ""journalist"" does not understand English in its current useage,his computer search engine is down (if he knows what a computer is), or this ""truth-seeker"" is just flat out trying to ""get the moneyfrom the rubes as quickly as possible"".As part of a research assignment I had to check the Hannity'sstatements for factual content from a variety of independent sources, including his own previous shows.I am neither a Democrat or a Republican and don't really careabout left, middle or right viewpoints. I do however care aboutthe truth. The very least this very odd person could do is to verify virtually any of his statements. I just don't know how any sane, literate,rational person could read this crap without bursting in laughter."
1,this guy is nuts,This is the single worst book I ever read. This guy uses his non-functioning brain cells to come to idiotic conclusions based purly on fantacy. This book should never have been published.
2,"Hannity, unamerican","The book highlights the hypocrisy of today's right wing talk show host: the author romanticizes war without having fought, pushes tax cuts that assist no one but himself and his elite friends, advocates cuts in education knowing his family will never need public education and launches unamerican personal attacks on political opponents in the name of ""patriotism."""
1,Unbelievable,"Zero stars. This book is about what the author thinks is his ""wisdom"". Actually, it contains lie upon lie, written only to serve the author's political purposes. Distorted views, misinterpreted facts spun in all directions to defend weak arguments. Please do not give money to this creep."
1,How has he goten to where he is?,"I do not support Sean Hannity and spent one afternoon reading the first half of this book at a local bookstore before deciding before my head exploded to set it down. Mr. Hannity's claims of a moral decay of american ingenuity comes from the hypocritical things he preaches. The division of American is what he has built his career on. To act that we are still this great superior country is a a joke and his nonsensical ramblings really should have this book collect dust for the next ten years, I do not recommend."
2,The problem with this book is the same problem as MOST books,"When a conservative writes a book, its almost ALWAYS TOO right winged. When a liberal writes a book, its almost ALWAYS TOO left winged.America could get much more out of reading a book that expressed one view, but didn't tell half-truths and leave vital information out."
2,Hannity is a Republican mouthpiece,"I really couldn't get into this book. I am a conservative, though I lean more toward the Libertarian party than the Republicans, but this work was just too lacking in balance for me. Hannity, with his TV and radio show, is doing good work overall, but this book is just not a helpful part of that work. If you are a die hard Repblican and want to read how your party is always correct and why no good ideas come from the left then this is the book for you. If you are looking for a balanced account from a conservative perspective, keep looking."
5,Hannity scares the left,Any time the left reacts with such vigor to a journalist such as Hannity it is because he reaches them on a level they do not want to be reached on. he makes them think seriously about their positions and what they stand for. Let us all give Sean Hannity the respect he deserves for reaching the left's clouded veil of lies and ignorance. the book is great!
1,THE ULTIMATE IN PHONY RIGHT WING SHMALTZ!,"Sean Hannity continues to push the envelope when it comes to sickening republican propaganda. The cover of this book alone is enough to make me want to puke. Hannity is the whitest man in America, and his ""Bush can do no wrong"" mentality is what destroys this country. Buy this book only if you're out of firewood."
4,umum..........,"I think this book is great, because Sean Hannity has bought up different issues to talk about. He reminds us about the problems that we are overcoming, like our freedom and security, and that we have to stand vigilant to against it.He has given us detailed analysis and evidences. For example, he closely examines the careers of some of today's leading liberal politicians, not just Clinton and Gore, but Daschle and Gephardt too, to show you how they are stood against what is best for America throughout their careers. I believe no one would really think about this from that long time ago."
1,He's got to be kidding.,"He's got to be kidding. Nobody could be so anti liberal/Clinton/Democrat and still be serious. Mr. Hannity would be a good prep act for some comedian. I bought this book thinking I would here some real facts, but this is ridiculous. I guess when all the others are trying to follow Rush it's somewhat hopeless. Dick Morris?????"
5,my only complaint,is that Sean isn't hard enough on the anti-American views of many on the left. the liberals will only be happy when this nation is a third rate puppet gov't allied with france and iran.
1,This is Junk,"Sean Hannity needs to shave about an inch of his hair back from his hairline so he won't look like a monkey.Seriously, though, this is a book full of repetitious blatherings about nothing. It is full of inaccurate ""statistics"" and conclusions about the world that lack any kind of insight.There's nothing new here. Just lots of misinformation. I'm no liberal. But, I am a writer. I know poor writing when I see it. And judging from his ""show"", anyone should be able to tell when someone is trying too hard to be smart. Hannity is just another low IQ guy that somebody thought looked like he could be a ""spokesman"" for their ideas.Don't waste 15 or 20 bucks on this moron. I'd rather have gone to a nice restaurant with my wife. Unfortunately, I can't get my money back and the stupid book will have to be used to line the birdcage--one lousy, boring page at a time."
1,The Subtitle of This Book Is Really Very Funny...,"The subtitle of this book is really very funny. The basic meaning of ""liberal"" is ""one who loves liberty."" It comes from the Latin ""liberalis,"" root ""liber,"" which means ""free."" Philosophically, ""liberal"" describes the belief that the right to be autonomous--a free agent, i.e., not enslaved--resides within each individual, as a ""right,"" rather than a privilege bestowed arbitrarily by authority. The whole idea of a liberal state is that every individual is subject to the same laws, regardless of status, wealth, or favor. The United States is the quintessential liberal nation in the entire history of the World.The opposite of ""liberal"" is ""authoritarian."""
1,Hannity's ideas would work...,"...in a planet far, far away...This book uses the logic of 3rd grade playground politics and it feels like it was writeen by some sort of hermit whose concept of the world relies on clippings from 50's newspapers.Hannity should talk to Fox News. They need another well spoken clown over there."
1,don't waste your money,This guy is such a stereotype of the ultra right wing lying lunatic. The only use for this sorry excuse of a book is to tear it up and use it to start a warm fire on a cold winter night.Don't waste your time nor insult your intelligence on this rubbish.
1,Brilliant shallow patriotism,"For those who wonder ""why do they hate us?"", look no further and read this book."
3,Real good,"I dont read a lot of books, except for comic books, but so I read Sean Hanitty's book and I think it was teriffic. He writes real good and slams the liberals real good! Sean and me agree on a lot of things and so it was cool to spend ($) on his book even though I can just hear whats in it for free on his radio show each day. My girlfriend thinks he's wrong about stuff but shes crazy. He gives it to the liberals real good."
1,"Offensive, Abominable Garbage","Hannity's very title is a giveaway here to the essential dishonesty of the conservative mindset: ""Liberty"" is an essential feature of ""Liberalism.""Hannity's ""liberty"" apparently does not include religious freedom for non-Christians, economic democracy, nor dissent from the Bush junta.People that REALLY love freedom should boycott any sponsors of Hannity. I do."
1,"Like Ann Coulter, but no one knows who he is...","I'll admit that I haven't read the book, mostly because there are other books that are worth more time (ah college, c'est la vie). Really, it seems like this guy is basically the male version of Ann (minus the blond hair), but no one knows who he is because no one cares about what he has to say. And worse, both of them are like Al Franken, except they don't realized they, too, are comedians. Yet, whatever...everyone needs reaffirmation that they are somehow right, and if it takes a slanted, biased report of the Left to do it, then enjoy...it's your misinformation."
1,sadly close minded and a little misguided,"I am sorry, but we are now in the times of freedom, as you so profusely oversuse this word, and that means admitting a little more equality. Stop equating our country's problems with ""those people"", we are not the innocent victims you make the US out to be--just do some more research and stop writing from a state of ego and involve a little more mind and heart. The members of other countries are not our enemies, just as are not the liberals of the world. I may not be liberal either, but to slam a liberal so harshly is truly to reject some of the beautiful, strong-minded people that started this country."
1,Sensationalistic banter,"I won't argue with the facts that Sean Hannity presents, but I disagree with his exaggerations and sensationalism when it comes to delivering his message. This guy just walks the extreme right tight rope and refuses to listen to the other side of anything."
1,"Extreme, and not much better than Franken...","Hannity has managed to demonstrate how extremes of any persuasion can harm a cause with some merits. I listen to him ocassionally, and can't keep from wincing painfully at some of the outrageous things he says, and at the way in which he shouts his callers and guests down, telling them they're not going to win, because ""this is my show"".As in his radio show, in this book Hannity exhibits a thorough lack of understanding of what being ""fair and balanced"" means. He strikes me as somebody who never really had a mind of his own, and who cherishes the opportunity to vociferously repeat the mantra of the far, far right in this country.If you really want a fair and balanced view of things, stick with open-minded O'Reilly, who takes on liberals, moderates, and conservatives equally when they are wrong, and who doesn't strive to justify wrongs and offer apologies just for the sake of remaining in one ideological camp, as extreme and skewed as it may be."
5,Excellent Read,"I think Sean Hannity should be very pleased with this book. The book uses clear and straight forward language so that many can easily comprehend the message he is trying to get across. Even as a very conservative 10-year-old, I was astonished at how much of a roadblock liberals can be in our government. I believe Mr. Hannity is correct - the Democratic party is in desperate need of reform."
1,Popular Conservatism,"Personally I think this guy as an editorialist stinks. Like most of the pundits at Fox he comes off with a biased slant and then has the audacity to call himself fair and balanced. I don't have a problem with conservative thought, and I like people like Saphire, George F. Will, and William F. Buckley.These guy's construct sound arguments and have a great command of the english language. Guy's like Hannity and O'reilly just set out to get people up-set about Madonna, hip hop, Hollywood, Michael Jackson, Hillary Clinton, Jesse Jackson, or some other liberal that may or may not be hurting this country. Sadly, these guys are probably the voice of those in the mid-west and the deep south and if you want to put your finger on the pulse of political thought outside of cities like New York, LA, and San Francisco then these are the sorts of guys you have to turn to as the values they argue for are very popular in these necks of the woods."
1,His Prose Is As Insipid As His Verbiage,"Let me say upfront that I am a conservative, campaigned for Reagan, voted for Bush -- the whole nine yards. Having said that, I CANNOT recommend this book. Sean, who seems like a nice enough guy, is just not very intelligent. What he writes in his book is basically a re-tread of things that Rush has said and written in a much more intersting and thoughtful way. Sean is a lightweight and so is his book. Nothing new at all. To be honest, I wish that Sean and I didn't share the same political philosphy. He comes across as so dumb that it's embarrassing to have him on my side."
1,The prince of liars,This man should be given a nobel for mass deception. The book is a waste of time and rubbish. He should learn a few points from his friend Bill O'Reily on how to captivate an audience in writing.
5,A must read for anyone of intelligence,"Having read the reviews I can tell that most of the left reviewing this book haven't even read it. Typical. As if anything less is expected. For the rest of thinking America, read the book and enjoy."
1,VERY low rent...,I'd still like to be a conservative -- in the time-honored Bill Buckley/Barry Goldwater fashion. But people like Hannity are so wretchedly stupid and unlettered that I react strongly against them. Has this man ever been to Europe? Has he ever had any friends? Does he really believe the nonsense he spouts?What has happened to this country?
4,Comprehensive conservatism,"I found Hannity's book to be very similar to Limbaugh's two books, which is not necessarily a bad thing. While I was able to anticipate much of what Hannity was going to say, I found his presentation entertaining with his own unique twist. This book will provide a great foundation to new conservatives."
1,Just watch Fox news and laugh at that,"The war of liberty to Sean includes having the government run more processes without interference. He is an advocate of more laws about morality and restrictions. Sean's biggest arguement is that the liberals have no good solution to the problem other than communism (come on, really?). I don't know if allowing the CIA to run the country would be much different than communism. He's just playing off people's fears from the past (mostly indoctrination about the evil enemy) to try and keep a stranglehold to the future. Sean's liberty needs the government to be involved in every moral question except for big business. It's all restrictive except for those huge corporations and money holders. I wonder why anyone would want a world where freedom means only Christians can stay out of jail?"
1,Brainless Garbagae-just like GWB (our most moronic president,"Why isn't Sean Hannity holding an apple pie or have a bald eagle in the background as well. Another title for this book could've been ""You're not a true patriotic american if you don't agree with everything I say or what Bush stands for.""This is the worst piece of garbage I've ever read. I could only read the first 50 pages and just couldn't go on. Horrible!"
1,"Yawn, nothing new","Save your money, people! Hannity offers nothing new in this waste of trees. ""Liberals bad - conservatives good"". Wow, that's a new message coming from your side, Sean. HIs words, his radio show, and his TV show are a waste of time and will dull the senses. A gem I heard last night on his radio show was him criticizing Sen. John Kerry, who was questioning the pre-war intelligence. Hannity said: ""Who is this guy to cricitize?"" Well, Sean, he's an American citizen, a Senator, and a Vietnam veteran to boot. Who are you, Toadboy? (Incidentally, I am NOT a Kerry supporter, but would Toad have said ""who is this guy"" about Sen. John McCain? I think not. Just shows his bias.)Hannity is merely another dittohead who poses in front of a flag to show how much of a patriot he is. Feh. And he's religious, as he endlessly reminds us. (By the way, Mr. Supercatholic Sean, Catholics do not believe in Creationism.)"
1,"Can't we have ""no star"" reviews?",Not the worst political tome ever written but very close.I was lent this pile of recycled wood pulp by a friend. I wouldn't buy it if my life depended on it.4th July 2004 - Independence From America Day
1,The dumbing down of America,This book wasn't written it was pasted and copied. No original thought but plenty of arrogance. The author is the true UGLY AMERICAN who is always right and has God on his side. Thankfully there are many parts of the world that are lightyears ahead of this Republican backwarding thinking mentality. Someday America will get back on track to progressive thinking.
1,What a moron!!,"Sean Hannity is a delusional, psychopathic right-wing nutjob of the highest proportion. That this man has been given a podium for his sophomoric and anti-intellectual drivel is an insult to the publishing industry. If this is what passes for serious political analysis and discourse in America today we are all in a heap of trouble.Only people with very limited intelligence or a desire to be brainwashed may want to read this book. Others please stay far away!!!"
1,Shallow propaganda,"As a non-american I did not expect to fall within the natural constituency of this book. However, I did not expect it to be such a blinkered diatribe. Unless you are a flag waving american there is really nothing in this book that even pertains to serious political commentary. The foundation upon which everything is built is a patriotic love of the US, and an unquestioning, patriotic acceptance that the US can only ever be a force for good. Any deviaton from this is unpatriotic and simply unacceptable. If this cornerstone is missing, as is the case for most non-americans, then the remainder of the arguments just do not stack up.From an outside perspective many arguments are simply laughable, such as the suggestion that the US media is biased to the left. The non-reporting of the 2000 election singlehandedly blows this theory completely out of the water. No further examples are necessary or indeed relevant."
1,Encouraging Hatred in the land of the free.,"Mr Hannity obviously serves a purpose here that is purely political. This book changed my life, I will never again read such biased crap again.I hope that those who do read this book also read a lot of other books to gain some perspective. If this is your only source of information, you are woefully uninformed, which is detrimental to you.Mr Hannity has sold his soul for monetary gain, I guess he is OK with that because his books will be around a lot longer than he will. Not that he will be remembered, except as a footnote to illustrate the current partisanship and hatred that Americans are feeling towards each other.As Lincoln said himself ""United we Stand, Divided we Fall""This book and books like it will only contribute to the fall of America."
1,LIAR,"Sean Hannity's book, Let Freedom Ring, is page after page lie upon lie. There is nothing honest about this book, in fact, I am currently wondering if ""Sean Hannity"" is his real name. Do not buy this book. There is no reason to give any money to a man as immoral and dishonest as this man."
2,Mr Inanity's masterpeace yet to come.,"In this opus, Mr. Inanity tells us how we should think. Deep stuff, no wonder. He tells us for freedom to ring, we must defeet liberalisms hold over our minds by the medias of televisions and radios. He also tells us to join the Army, unlike Mr. Inanity who is too busy making money to join the Army and lets others fight for his right to party and write more inannites."
2,Gets a C-,"I'm a Political Science professor at the University of Mississippi. If a student had turned this in as a term paper, I would've given him/her a C-. This book is poorly researched and sloppily written."
3,Okay but really not as good as Bill,I dunno. Something about this book just didn't thrill me. Seems a little wimpy and not too hot. Hard to understand in places. I think O'reilly does a better job. In my opinion Bill has got more meat on the bone.
1,Worthy of Zero Stars,"I am appalled that there are people in this country that think this guy has something to say. You were more informed about the liberal media? What liberal media? Did you EVER think, while reading this book, that Hannity works for FOX NEWS, owned by RUPERT MURDOCH!? Have you ever watched a second of MSNBC? Conservative bias is the basis on which television news networks operate, not to mention radio. If you are mad at exposing truths and honest reporting, you should not be allowed to vote.Another thing that should disqualify you from voting is having ABSOLUTELY NO knowledge of the Constitution. This book is a testament to the fact that Hannity has never read or ever understood the words and the nature of the Constitution. Please don't EVER EVER EVER buy this book. Buy literature that TELLS THE TRUTH!"
5,"Liberals, look out!!","Sean Hannity does it again! What a searing indictment of the left in America! Those who disapprove of this book because Sean calls them like he sees them are not honest with themselves, and their partisan leanings are made clear."
1,Nothing new,"Sorry Sean, dude, but there's nothing new here!! Until you can come up with something original, I won't buy another one of your books. I wasted my money, darn it!"
1,"demagogic trash talk from an uneducated, unprincipled personage","One overriding question about hannity and his ilk:WHY< oh WHY, do these self-important poseurs absolutely hate the American middle class SO MUCH? Any scheme in the past 100 years that improves the lives of middle-class Americans they ritualistically oppose. No lie is too large or too outrageous to shout! This man is nothing short of contemptible as is the author of 'his books.' Please, you don't REALLY think this twice-college flunk-out writes these screeds himself, do YOU?"
5,HANNITY ROCKS,"Sean Hannity says it all with his great read 'Let Freedom Ring...""If you are looking for a read that chronicles today's New World Order, this is the book.Hannity's book should be required reading in all political science classes.Peter Wilkinson Thiele"
1,"He's right, everybody else wrong","This book made me sick. Normally, I agree with his general notion, but.....I can't stand individuals who confuse facts and opinions. His view is so narrow, and his intolerance for alternate opinion become quite cumbersome, I would rather listen to some old timer's prattle for the entertainment value. Don't waste your money, but more importantly, save your time (better spent reading Hillary's new book, if you ask me!!!!!)."
2,Factual Misinformation and Fabrications,"blah, blah, blah. I got through the book, which had several factual errors and misrepresentations. Take the book for what its really worth. Another pompous FNC windbag cashing in by jotting down his rantings and ravings. The comfort I got after reading it the book was doing my part as an enviromentalist, and throwing it in the paper recycling bin."
3,At least I read the book,"As a political moderate and social conservative, one of the smartest things I have done in the last year was to quit talk radio. I do still agree with many of the opinions of Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, and Sean Hannity, but have become slowly turned off by their style. Angry and antagonistic, these talk jocks only served to create similar feelings in me. Not the attitudes I strove for as a Christian man. In an case, Hannity's book is not bad, it just is not good. It becomes repetitive as he continually lectures on the same points over and over. It begins to make you wonder if fans of the genre are dense. He does not conceive anything I have not heard before, which makes for even duller reading. By the way, notice how few reviewers give this book between 2 and 4 stars. I believe many do not even read the book, and only rate based on political persuasion."
1,WHY!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is nothing short of awfull! The fact that sane people read this book without their heads exploding discusts me! It seems to me that not only does MR HANNITY hold no respect for his readers he also has no respect for the office of the president. He refers several times to liberals attacking our president for his war and he (mr hannity) seems to completely forget that during KOSVO he himself said all sorts of evil hatefull things about BILL CLINTON! As a person who supports free thinking and debate I must say that there are better examples of right wing case presentation. I dont feel the need to attack the platform MR HANNITY launches himself off of i just feel that a little fact checking on his part and a little less mud slinging would have made it a better read. If you must be an attack journalist please do it in a truthfull fashon.much lovealec
1,Sean's great but he really is a mental midget,"I really enjoy listening to Sean on WABC in New York City and agree with many of his points (which also happen to be Rush's points) but he is a mental midget when it comes to discourse, laying out the facts and conveying intelligent ideas. Does anyone really believe ALL liberals are bad and only have bad ideas. I mean come on! Sean Hannity is and always will be 'Rush Lite' Although he seems to be making a very good career out it!"
1,Waste of time,One star is being generous for this trivial compilation of garbage. Reading this book is a waste of time! The author doesn't bother to get the facts right. His opinion is much more valid than reality.
1,what a baby,what a baby. cry cry cry!!! nothing worth reading. if he wrote this himself he needs a ghostwriter.
1,Entertainingly bad writing; an ideal gift for relatives who laugh at idiots,"This bilious, confused, smug collection of bigotry is astoundingly bad. It is frightening that so many people read this moron as a serious commentator; possibly assuming that his work at Fox makes him a journalist and not a monkey banging a drum.Is he really this stupid? Some right wingers seem too cretinous for belief, however I genuinely think Hannity believes what he writes. We should send this guy medicine.On the other hand, he isn't Ann Coulter, so he gets one star.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
4,More FOX News via the paperback,"This book is very similar to that of Bill O'Reillys' books in that they are very similar to what is said on either hosts' shows.Hannity takes more time to lay out his arguments than what is alloted in the show's 5 minute segments using history and (gasp) facts as back up. Sure, some things are from his heart, but even conservatives are allowed to ""feel"" compassion about a topic.I preferred more biographical tales of Sean than what was included in this book. Part of a man's character is defined by the path he walked; what made Sean Hannity the man he is today?"
1,A book to stupify you...,"I can't imagine anyone, democrat OR republican, with any shred of independant thought, taking Sean Hannity seriously.Anyone with a passion for facts or well-thought arguments would do well to steer clear of this. Hannity's books do have a perverse entertainment value in that one thinks...Can he really be THAT misguided? It's very ""Train wreck"" style journalism. Very bad, but you just can't seem to turn away from it. Hannity seems to feel that 'Liberals are stupid/evil/bad' is a justifiable argument for supporting any republican philosphy. It just doesn't hold up if you are trying to find clear, legitimate conservative arguments to broaden your perspective.I will paraphrase a quote from the film 'The American President'..""someone who claims to love America but clearly hates Americans."" That's sums up Hannity's view of this country, if you read closely enough."
1,Read only to confirm your prejudices; no real info here...,"The principal casualty of Hannity's tract is objectivity: of course, he doesn't even pretend to be objective, as he announces in the title of this book, but even a long-time conservative has trouble swallowing some of the BS he slings in this book. Most of us are economic conservatives, but this doesn't preclude either compassion or a truly fair assessment of both the left and the right, and Hannity has no use for either of these.A real stinker."
1,Celebrities should keep their simplistic views to themselves,"Seeing that Sean Hannity is, at best, a media celebrity, I find it hard to believe that his book would be received any differently than a radical noxious rant along the lines of something you might hear from, say, Barbra Streisand. But, unfortunately, there are those who seem to consider Sean as a source of real political commentary. Sorry to say, but Mr. Hannity's misguided invectives are to real political commentary what Danielle Steele is to the world's literary canon. Sadly, but probably even more telling, I'm sure it's no stretch to say that, more often than not, you're going to see both names, Sean and Danielle, at the bottom of the same shopping cart.One bit of advice to those who may have read this book and were unfortunate enough to find that their views were in the least bit influenced by it. Turn off your TVs, read more books and it should go away."
5,Couldn't put it down!!,"Sean Hannity is right on, once again. This book will open your eyes and keep them open!! He has the guts to speak the truth of what is happening to our country. I love this book and recommend it to everyone! Thanks Sean!"
1,To write or not to write....,"But he didn't even write the book. He said it on the air. All he did was talk into a cassette recorder, and then someone else wrote the book from those recordings."
1,"Oh, please!",I wish Sean & his listeners loved America as much as they worship Mr. Bu$h & the Republican party...
1,this book is crap,"full of lies, deception and half-truths, this person is completely out of context with the real world, his only job here is to spin a web of lies to snare as many people as he can that are not smart enough to check the facts."
1,"Rhetoric with a capital ""R""","Reading this book was a dissapointment. I was hoping that Sean Hannity wasn't as dumb as he appeared on TV, but alas I was wrong. Sean Hannity couldn't think up an original idea if it kicked him in the .... Everything he says and writes toes the line of the Republican platform. Don't waste your money. If you want republican rhetoric buy a Limbaugh book, at least he's entertaining."
1,I'm relieved,"Until I read this book, I was concerned about the impact the new conservative movement is having upon current affairs (actually I think the term conservative has been hijacked, but nevertheless...). Having waded through most of this, I feel much better. There's no way that such a movement could ever be successful over the long haul, based on the kind of shallow, poorly reasoned, self-serving nonsense laid out in this ""book"". Have no fear, folks. This is a fad, like the hula hoop. Eventually it will come to pass that none of this plays out as predicted, and it will lose its momentum. Hannity will be one of those ""undead"" like Liddy and North, who have influence within their own choir of braying admirers, but not much pull elsewhere. I'm glad I read it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's worried about the future of liberalism. I'm relieved; I thought this guy was smarter than he comes off here. Paper Tiger."
1,Dangerous propaganda !,"Hannity uses a patriotic decoy to sell his ultra-conservative views about American values and freedom, whereas in reality he's trying to build a bulletproof jail for your mind. What's really infuriating is that he constantly wraps himself with the American flag and uses God to push his garbage out. Shame on you, Mr. Hannity!Bottom line, you are either ""with"" him or ""against"" him. Be careful if you dare to disagree with Mr. Hannity, he may assume you are related to ""Al-Qaeda"". It's not his fault, his anger blinds him. A basic course on humanitarianism and a bit of therapy would do Hannity plenty of good. Bush and Hannity - separated at birth?"
2,We have met the enemy and it is us!,"Fifty years ago the most popular comic strip was Pogo, known for the warning, ""I have met the enemy and it is us!"" It was a comment on the McCarthy era's witchhunt for communists. After the Cold War, america was looking for an enemy and Sean Hannity has found that indeed, it is us. Or, at least some of us. Liberals. One of the Fox networks ""unfair and unbalanced"" conservatives who, more than Tom Brokaw's raised eyebrows, constantly raises his voice against Liberalism, he does it again in his book. As a reviewer says above, Hannity isn't very bright and his views in this book show it. What passes for ""fair and balanced"" in Let Freedom Ring, as on Fox is decidedly unfair and unbalanced. Hannity blames Liberalism for all of america's ills. A dangerous and uncharitable view. Re-cycled Rush Limbaugh he, too, preaches to the choir. A sure-fire success for those americans who believe more than half their fellow citizens are the enemy."
3,Competent,"I had really hoped that A&E; would ""do"" this one. I would have loved to see how the female repertory cast members would have handled the brilliant spring sisters in this book.It's a good, vigorous read. I'm hoping to get a copy of Michael Pritchard's reading of it, based on how well he's handled the other Wolfe books. They're coming out on CD audio now, which is great for clarity and ease of use.Not the best, I suppose, but this book belongs on the shelves of any mystery fan."
3,Early Stout and a lot of fun,I liked this book mainly because it was set in the '3Os and I have always loved the movies and books of that time. IMHO some of Stout's early books like The Rubber Band and this one are as zany as some of the best mapcap comedies of the same period. This is not one of the best of the Wolfe opus but definitely not the worst. A book that has the trio of Hawthorne sisters as well as a veiled disfigured widow and a camera-crazy young woman has a lot going for it.
5,More Fantastic Music by Dave Brubeck!,"This album contains more music written in unconventional time signatures. If you like Brubeck's Time Out, you'll like this album. I think that ""It's a Raggy Waltz"" and ""Unsquare Dance"" alone make this album worthwhile. The rest is just frosting on the cake."
3,it's OK,"Just an ordinary cd, it will be much better if it were put together with others, probably in a compilation cd?"
4,Larger than expected but nice shape,"I like the shape and material of this. It's a bit bigger than I thought, but I'm a beginner and it is about the width of my hubby so should be ok once I get used to it. I just wish these companies would put actual measurements so you knew what you are buying."
1,Made for a elephant!,"Decided to try the product, because it looked like fun. This is really not usable. When I purchased, I'm thinking about the size of your thumb, but this thing is huge. Good luck using it!"
2,disappointing,I discovered Benny Goodmans music about 2 years ago and since have grown to enjoy his style quite a bit. Having grown up in the 60's and 70's I had no exposure to him on TV. This is a very disappointing video if you are only interested in Benny Goodman. He open the video and all you see of him is maybe 3 minutes. It goes on to other greats of swing but much too little time is spent on Benny
2,Strange color transfer,"Has anyone else noticed a problem with the new DVD transfer? My copy has a constant ""flicker"" in which the color tint changes back and forth to a pinkish hue...This is supposed to be a new digital transfer....."
5,Bigadoon,"This movie is a great get-a-way from the real world and take an adventure in an imaginative place! Love the actors, love the music, love the movie!!!"
2,Butchered version of the Broadway musical.,"They just totally demolish the songs from the show, many are just cut out. And too bad Gene Kelly couldn't sing a lick. It's painful to listen to him trying to sing those great songs. ""Almost Like Being in Love,"" is a disaster as is ""Heather on the Hill."" No voice at all. He can barely squeeze the lyrics out.To listen and find out what a great musical this really is, get the EMI recording with Brent Barrett, Rebecca Luker, John Mark-Ainsley, and Judy Kaye."
2,brigadoon,When I saw the movie 60 years ago I really enjoyed it. The DVD version was a big disappointment. Very little singing and dancing. It seems something was cut out of the dvd version
1,Not real exiting,"I didn't really enjoy this movie. I love Gene Kelly ALOT!!!! (I'm actually watching Anchors Aweigh right now). And he never fails to capture my attention, but this movie just didn't seem real to me. The sets seemed really fake, and the dancing was not really the most impressive. I love movies like 'Singin in the Rain,' because I love the dancing and things. I'm a dancer myself and i'm over twelve and have seen almost all Gene Kelly's movies and this one is probably at the bottom of my list. But don't not see it just because of this review, go ahead you may love it!!!!!"
2,"OK, if you love Gene Kelly and dancing...","But not a good guidepost - at all - if you are interested in being in a local production of the musical. No one sings atr all in this movie but Gene Kelly, and as we all know Cyb Charisse doesn't sing in this. Charlie's great ballad and Meg Brockie's 2 funny songs are cut from the movie."
5,Great Memories,"This is now of my all time favorite movies, Very glad to add ithis to my collection. Arrived just as described."
5,Good movie,I have always liked this movie very much. The misic and the dancing are great. Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse were so good together.
5,Outstanding!,"This is a love story in the classic tradition. If you purchase this movie because it stars Gene Kelly, Van Johnson, or Cyd Charisse, you will be greatly disappointed because it does ""not"" contain their finest performances. This story is for those people who cried during the last half of Steel Magnolia's, E.T., and Bambi. It is pure sentimentalism....AND I LOVED IT. I have seen it on the stage, screen, and T.V. (Robert Goulet did a remake in the late 1960's.) Purchase this movie, if for no other reason, than to see how one man, and one woman, can love each other so much they overcome all obstacles to bring their love together."
3,ho hum,"Considering the villagers had only had 'the miracle' going for two days (in their eyes), they seem mighty scared of strangers and set in their ways. Not a very believable premise, but a pleasant diversion of a movie."
2,"Only 100 Years? Why Not Go For 1,000?","This really should have been a good movie. I love most of Vincente Minelli's stuff. Gene Kelly is the MAN! Van Johnson did a decent job playing against type and reminded me of his hoofer roots. And Cyd Charrise was her perenially lovely and swift-footed self. But I am just sort of lukewarm on this one. The songs were o.k. The choreogaphy was good, but the plot lacked something like maybe spontaniety and cleverness. The sets looked flat and uninspired. I didn't get involved in this one at all.I often lament the death of the MGM musical, but here it seems like it really needed a expedidited funeral service.This is one rare example where a great stage musical just didn't translate well as a movie. If you want to see MGM at its best, try SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS, or SHOWBOAT, but avoid this mess."
1,Bad Streaming,"The movie's ok (I've seen it many times before), but the streaming froze repeatedly. The only recourse was giving it a few hours to unfreeze itself, and then it froze again."
1,"Music not good, just really bad","Watched for about 10 minutes, and some music came on and it was really annoying, and a good place for this movie is the trash."
4,Brigadoon,Brigadoon - the force of the love makes Gene Kelly returns to the place where would be the supposed asleep city of Brigadoon and miraculously the loved of his awakes of a sleep that would have to last one hundred years.
4,muscial made for widescreen,"All the great muscials were made for widescreen -- especially so, Brigadoon. Like Oklahoma and Carousel, so much of the story expressed through dance was lost in the VHS modified version. If you presently own it on VHS full screen, you need to update your library with the widescreen DVD version."
5,A Wonderful Escape,"A truly lovely film - You must see it, if for no other reason to witness the luminescent Cyd Charisse in one of her greatest roles. If you consider yourself a romantic and respond to music and dance, you are in for a treat."
4,Brigadoon,"Brought back many memories of Kelly, Johnson, and Cyd Charise at their acting and dancing best in this film. Musical score was great!"
5,Classic Musicals,Get away from the here and now to Brigadoon. This is a classic movie that lets the viewer believe in fantasy for a little while. Artists like Gene Kelly can move you to a song and a dance. It will make your day.
5,BRIGADOON,Great entertainment for the whole family. Everything Scotland and th Scots are supposed to be like is in here. The music is memorable. All you have to do is believe for a while that there could be a Brigadoon.
3,"Good, but has a feeling distance and heaviness.","I'm so in love with Gene Kelly, I'd watch him mow grass. But, in 'Brigadoon' Kelly seems to have something else on his mind during the making of this film and it shows. Many times, his eyes gaze empty into the distance, making you want to wave your hand in front of his face. And in some of the dance sequences, both Kelly and Cyd Charrise (spelling?) are looking down at the ground. Even with all this, the dancing is superlative, as usual, and Charisse provides lots of on-screen sizzle with Kelly. If you missed your high school's production of this musical, see this version."
3,another Lerner and Loewe musical,"When I first saw this movie I was too young to appreciate the costumes and the ideas involved in the plot.In the 1950's we were involved in the Korean war where the cold war was pretty hot. Most people with the bombers hanging over their headwanted a simpler, safer and saner world,but 1751 really wasn't that even on the highlands.The witch and satin worship was big in the early 1700's.Lerner and Loewe are the American musical comedy writing team of lyricist and librettist Alan Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe.Brigadoon is a legend of a fairy town like the island Avalonin King Arthur.A New York fellow on vacation falls for a woman of the village in a place out of time and space.Although the bag pipe bands all playing at once is something very strange in pentatonic Celtic tones,overall there isn't a lot original about the music in this play.Gene Kelly's dancing touch doesn't quite raise movie to the level needed."
5,The best movie ever,This is my all time favorite movie. I have had it for years on VHS and just finally got it on DVD. LOVE IT!
3,NOT QUITE ALL THAT IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE,"The detailed info states that the perches are adjustable not only to keep squirrels away but also to allow the owner to keep larger birds from perching if he/she wishes to invite only small birds. Even with the perch setting at its most sensitive Bluejays and Blackbirds have no difficulty perching and chowing down. The adjustable spring-action does, however, keep the squirrels from perching. As soon as a furry fellow latches on his weight pulls the perch down and closes the food ports. So the claims are 50% correct and if you don't mind going through an inordinate amount of bird seed thanks to voracious appetites of Bluejays, the feeder is a good one."
4,Flin Flon,"I was looking for pictures of my hometown when I saw this movie online too. As for Flin Flon, its a sweet town. I've had tons of good times here."
1,Hmmm...........,"Interesting movie. I haven't seen it yet but hey I might. As for Flin Flon, it the city where I live and it is a great place even if it is far north. It is so beautiful and I think everybody should at least once visit Flin Flon."
5,Laura Bridgman!,"I LOVE this book! This book is talking about Laura Bridgman.Laura is blind,deaf,mute and she can't smell or taste.Laura had a illness called Scarlet Fever.She had this illness when she was two years old! Her brother and sisters had this illness also.But only she lived out of all the children in her family! I felt sorry for Laura Bridgman when I read this book.This is a really sad story."
3,Don't believe the list price discount here,"I selected 3 stars because I just installed this product today and have yet to find out if it works or not. I had to comment, however, that the $70 list price is absurd. I bought a 25' roll at a big box home improvement store (the one where the employees wear orange aprons) for under $20...appears to be the same thing. So you are not saving a ridiculous amount of $$$ to buy this on Amazon.It appeared to work OK, but I have to admit that this was used as a band-aid on the very decaying wood above my gutters. I figure it will buy me a couple of months of peace-of-mind knowing that water is no longer splashing off my roof, into my gutters and then back under the shingles to cause more rot. Perhaps it will save my facia until I get the roof replaced.After installing I started to worry about the adhesive attracting cockroaches...will update my review for sure if that happens!"
2,"Pretty, compact, high maintenance....","This is a fairly pretty, small hummingbird feeder. It is quite delicate, and is high maintenance as you have to keep it at least half full for the feeding tubes to reach the liquid, so since it's so small, you will have to fill it often. I will probably give it as a gift; too much fuss for me."
1,Relatively poor quality,"I purchased this set for work on a Porsche, removing axle shafts. The 8mm bit rounded off after torquing about (10) bolts to 30 ft-lbs. I ordered a new part from Snap-On. These don't seem to hold up well."
2,Okay for one time use.... then they are scrap,"I bought this set to use on a 2003 Mk4 VW GTi axle removal and reinstall. Well, they worked okay to remove the axle, but I just barely got it back on since the 10mm tool rounded off... and that was after only ONE time use! I bought these at Pep Boys at the time and should have returned them since they are crap, but I needed them in a pinch over a weekend. I would recommend buying the Schwaben triple square socket set; Mfg Part #S15-HBS1406T. Thanks for reading my review!"
5,Great little essential set for your VW,This is a high quality set of specialized bits for working on your beloved VW. I'm glad I bought it as it saved me much headache in changing my drive axle.
5,Changed my life!!!!!,"What can I say about this book? I was drowning in a sea of debt with no land in sight. I knew something had to change, but I had no idea where to go to get real life solutions to my problems. Then I happened upon this book.I cannot tell you how many hours I spent reading this book, feeling emotionally naked and vulnerable - as if Mark Waldman himself had ripped away the veil of control I'd maintained in order to hide my shame, and looked deep into the pit of my soul.Sure...I cried. I'm not ashamed to admit it. It is frightening to awake from a deep sleep and suddenly see life's infinite possibilities. The purr of a kitten. The gentle hum of a bee. The freedom from debt.Thank you Mr. Waldman for writing this book. It has become my bible, offering rescue from so much more than just student loans. I wish I could share this book with all the children of the world. I'm quite sure the world would be a better place if I could.Love,Ted Meisel"
1,useless barrier,"We got the highland pet barrier for our 6 month old Akita mix puppy. It didn't fit our Chrysler Town and Country (even thought it said it fits all vans and SUVs) so we bought the extension pack. The extension pack helped the unit reach the top and bottom of the cargo area, but our puppy was easily able to either fit through the gaps in the bars, or just knock the entire unit down and make himself comfy in the front of the vehicle. After months of struggling with this unit trying to make it work, we ended up throwing it in the dump, and got a travelling harness and leash that we attach to an anchor in the cargo area and it keeps Oliver safely in place. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Not Very Convenient,"It would have been better for the vertical bars to be spring loaded for installation purposes. It is hard to put together and install in the back of a minivan for someone with back issues. My dogs blew right through it and ended up in the front seat before we knew it (they're Aussies, so go figure) Also, it leaves marks in the ceiling of my van that I can't get out. Not thrilled with the design. So far it hasn't been very useful, but I will keep trying."
5,All the Gold in California ROCKS!,I have no idea what this song is about but it's awesome. They play it on Music Choice - Classic Country (comcast digital cable 403) all the time!!
4,As Expected,"These are great songs by the Gatlins. They sound like the original recordings, so I am very satisfied with this purchase."
4,"Great Music, Poor Quality Recordings","I have loved the Gatlins and their music since the first time I heard them! This is a wonderful compilation of some of their best tunes, but this CD should be remastered! A couple songs start too abruptly (like the recording started after the song began) and a couple recordings sound like they were copied from a warped cassette tape. Good music, poor quality production."
3,Some songs dragged like the old 8-track tapes.,"The Gatlins talent actually rate 5 stars. But the analong tape some of the early songs were recorded on slowed down and drug a bit as the old 8-tracks use to do. At approx 1:43 during ""I Wish You Were Someone I Loved"" and ""Sure Feels Like Love"" at around 44 seconds. Also,the last 5 seconds of ""Delta Dirt"" was quite wavey. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to my music. There is just no legitimate excuse for this. These guys deserved better treatment of their recordings. The Gatlins are a class act with amazing talent. This would easily be a 5 star review if not for the poor sound on some songs."
3,Cool!!,"This is a very enterteining DVD.I wish Triple H would become a Bad Guy, I dont feel him as a fan favorite, he is the best villan ever!!"
1,Flawed Product,"This super ball was purchased a week before xmas as a gift because of its cool eyeball design. Unfortunately, it arrived a few days before the event with a split across the iris and pupil. It was too late to return it, so it was given as a flawed gift to a little girl who loves eyeballs. I probably could have given it a better review, had the product not arrived already damaged."
3,Smooth Voice,"I love hearing Walter Jackson pour out his heart in these songs on his cd. They sound so good and mellow. ""That's What My Mama Said"" I could play that song over and over. Great voice and a great cd."
5,Very Underrated Artist,I got to Hear His stuff when I was a Little boy thanks to My Mother.back then Radio gave everybody a chance&you had to bring the goods&Walter Jackson did.He had a Cool Vocal Delievery.the music is still very soulful&right on time.Artists like Him shouldn't be overlooked they have alot going for them if given a fair chance.
2,Wire Wrap Holder,"This item has openings which are too large for some wrap boxes, causing them to fall out, and openings which are too small for some other items, like Zip Loc bag boxes. My wrap boxes don't fit snugly as shown in the ad for the wire wrap organizer. I would have liked to have known the exact dimensions of the openings so I could have determined whether my boxes would fit correctly."
4,Wire Wrap Organizer,This product does exactly what I wanted it to do. Makes all my wrap items convient. It was easy to install.
5,Vital resource -- should have been published a year ago!,"At last, the definitive guide to programming Windows CE. You'll have to forget all about using MFC -- it looks as though the official position is to forget it -- but the examples (included along with the SDKs on the CD-ROM) will help you get on with the job of writing applications.From basic operations to advanced use of the SIP (undocking! I didn't know that was possible! :) this is the CE version of Petzold. The only CE programming book you need."
2,This book is a little bit old(-fashion),It covers only the previous versions of WinCE. The programming style is quite similar with good old Win 3.1 programming. It covers neither ActiveSync nor MFC. But it still remains useabel. Never the less i think the book of Chris Muench is more valuable (It covers also the new PocketPC).
5,This is (so far) THE book on programming WindowsCE,"Of all the books I looked at for Windows CE programming, this was by far the best. If you've read Petzold's Programming Windows, you'll feel right at home. Has the same style of writing & examples. Easy to pick up for even the novice C/C++ programmer.All code is written in C. Doesn't use the Windows CE SDK, MFC, or ATL."
1,Not what I was hoping for,"After seeing Florin with Bireli Lagrene I was expecting a cd with a lot more fire to it. He's a monster player, but this didn't make an impression at all."
4,Great price!,"I bought it, was delivered in a timely manner and it works, this was a good purchase. Has an indicator light to let you know the charging status."
1,samsung gravity wall charger,This charger broke the first day at the metal part that plugs into phone.Not very sturdy and found to be hard to plug in without feeling like youwill break it. I don't plan to buy any more.
3,Disappointing,"I love lighthouses, and I was intrigued by the premise of the book, but the execution (no pun intended) left something to be desired. The potential is there, with setting and characters, but the promise is not realized. I found the writing stilted and dull and aimed at a (at most) sixth-grade reading level. You would be hardpressed to find a compound sentence in this book. There were some inane observations in this book, including the observation that the cafe was ""surprisingly deserted between breakfast and lunch."" Wouldn't it obviously be so? It seems nitpicky, but these things add up.I liked it enough to see if the second in the series is an improvement."
2,PROSE AS PALLID AS THE DEAD,"I read this one at the recommendation of a local reader. I give LIGHTHOUSE two stars because my familiarity with this genre is limited and my expectations for quality perhaps misplaced.Unfortunately, halfway through the text, the writer had still failed to create a concrete believable setting for the story. This should be a minimum expectation for any work of fiction. Even the allegedly developed characters are hopelessly flat. The dialogue is awkward and rarely reveals anything about the characters except that they are dull.It was only with great determination that I finished this vague little book, which did at least present the occasion for some of the worst similes ever set to mass market ink."
3,"Good, but not great.","I read the whole book and enjoyed it but found some of the situations a little bit out there. This having been said, I commend anyone who writes a book and gets it published. I wouls [pass it on to a friend."
2,Not that good,"Since I'm a fan of lighthouses & mysteries I thought I would really like this book. But, I really couldn't get into it. It put me to sleep most of the time. It just wasn't that good not even for .99"
2,Innkeeping with murder,Save your money. Kind of interesting but the motive for the murders is not very believable.
2,Not so hot.,This book leans heavily on the cliched location and has virtually no story. It isn't very good. I don't recommend it.
5,Page turner,A great read that kept me up at night wondering how I would react if a murdered lived next door to me.
1,One of the Worst!,"This is, by far, one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot line is so illogical. Why a sharp, intelligent woman would be interested in leaving her husband for such a creep is not credible to me. I kept thinking the book would get better as I progressed, but it never did. Don't waste your time."
4,Bernard Samson is a gem.,"This book can standalone as a good spy story, but only reaches excellence when read as part of the trilogy - Berlin Game, Mexico Set, and London Match. The tension ebbs and flows throughout the trilogy, but it isn't until the climax of London Match that we see the full scope. Highly recommended!"
4,Solid companion to the series.,"With the sad state of health care in this country, Bill Moyers' engaging series looks to be quite prophetic 10 years after it first aired. As a casual observer of illness my whole life, I firmly believe that so much of what ails people is psychosomatic. Understanding how the mind works will be crucial in health care in the 21st century, as the model we currently have just isn't cutting the mustard. The book is a nice companion to the series, but the video of the Chinese lady receiving brain surgery using only acupuncture as anesthesia needs to be SEEN to be fully appreciated. My favorite video part is Jon Kabat-Zinn's use of meditation as a way of alleviating pain. I often show this Episode 3 to my classes and they are certainly fascinated. The book is a good place to start, but try to find the tapes at your local library also. P.S. Bill Moyers deserves some kind of national medal for his sustained excellence as a broadcaster!!!"
4,Sweet movie - must-see for Reba fans,"It's not an amazing movie (which is why it didn't rate 5 stars from me), but I do like the story and the performances. Reba is just wonderful. Definitely a must-see for any Reba fan."
2,STORY IS GOOD; MCENTIRE FAILS AS AN ACTRESS!,"When she utters the line ""I feel so violated""...Reba is totally inept as an actress in this movie. THe story is inspiring and uplifting but McEntire is no actress. She is a complete and total failure which bogs the movie down. Its a shame they couldn't have had a ""real"" actress play this part. THe movie would have been wonderful and worthy of a five star rating. The supporting cast is o.k. but when they play off McEntire they look inept. SHe makes them look bad. I'm sorry but acting is not McEntire's forte."
1,Should have stuck to just the song,"My wife and I watched this when it was on television. We loved the song and the music video. We were both hoping for a great follow-up to them.Nope. This is nothing more than an Anita Hill, liberal feminist, man basher movie. They concentrated on the whole 'no means no' tag line of Hillary clinton and her ilk of the time. It could have been so much more like the music video. In fact, they could have kept Huey Lewis and stretched the video out another 125 minutes into the movie.Major disappointment. Yes, go ahead and bash me in comments - I don't care. I am not politically correct and will still speak (type) my mind. This movie was terrible."
1,save your money,"Purchased this adapter to use while out of town participating in a dog competition to keep my pooch cool. Lasted @ 4hrs before failing, ended up going to town to buy batteries, bummer."
3,Voltage Regulator Gets Hot,"The ProSelect DC Car Adapter works well in that it provides energy for my dog's crate fan to rotate its blades. The two downsides are that #1 the voltage regulator in the middle gets really hot, and #2 Twenty feet is way more length than is necessary to go from the front seat to the back seat."
4,another all time favorite!!!,"if you havent heard the refreshments before then you have been truly deprived,this band should have been bigger than they were but sadly they were dropped from there label.this album is overlooked and underated,i listen to this cd as much as ffbb and it never gets old.you could say that the music takes a different vibe then fizzy fuzzy and thats not a bad thing at all!i wish that the refreshments were still around today but the good thing is at least roger clyne i still putting out music with the peacemakers!"
4,"Still doesn't beat FizzyFuzzyBig&Buzzy, but still good!","Their previous CD beats their new, and last, release. ""Dolly"" is a really great song, as are the others, but you still can't quite beat the old stuff! For those who didn't know, The Refreshments are no longer. Several band members have dropped out, though Roger and P.H. will still be going strong with their new group, The Peacemakers. This new ensemble's CD should be released in early spring of 1999! Everyone support it!!"
3,"Good album, not as good as the first","The first Refreshments album is without a doubt one of my top 10 favorite of all time. Maybe it's becuase of that I expected so much out of this one, and I feel just a little let down. Played back-to-back, you notice there's more instrumentation and a way different production feel on this one, and it seems much less spontaneous. Seems the producer brought every level up but lost that good fun no-frills sound in the process. Some songs I'll usually skip, like Broken Record (annoying) but others are very catchy, listenable. These guys write good hooks. And ""Fonder and Blonder"" has got to be one of the most wicked ex-girlfriend songs ever. If you've never bought a Refreshments disc, try the other one first. If you have, this is a good follow-up but don't expect to be bowled over."
4,very refreshing!! check out Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers!,"what can i say that hasnt been said about this group? very underrated on both albums, it was very dissapointing that they disbanded. good news though, Roger clyne is still around. if you like the alt-southern rock and alt-country style of the refreshments, check out ROGER CLYNE AND THE PEACEMAKERS. They have 3 very good albums, a bit more alt-country than the refreshments, but Roger has that voice and those incredibly fun and touching lyrics that show what a great character he is. LONG LIVE ROGER CLYNE!!! (also, check out their concerts, very cheap and tons of fun!!!)"
4,shame this band is gone,"Everyone who owns FFBB probably agrees that that album was far superior to this one in respects to music. The band lighten up the beats and a more cheerful country rock sound is b/c of this. Songs such as ""Tributary Otis"", ""Sin Nombre"", ""Good Year"", and ""Una Soda"" are excellent songs. ""Horses"" is a slight disappointment in the case it really isn't a song, and I'm not too fond of ""Dolly"". Other than that, the whole album is strong.I wish this band was around still. They showed great musicianship in their songs and the lyrics are sentimental and tell a story each time. Almost as if they are bar stories or cowboy tales. Whatever way, the songs are good. The Bottle and Fresh Horses is a unique clash of southwest country, and cali rock, all w/ a mexican influence. If you have FFBB give this a shot, I'm sure you'd like it."
2,Didn't like it,"After repeated listening, I cannot get into this CD the same way that I did their first CD. Their first offering had great lyrics and a unique sound. This CD has a comparable sound, but the lyrics took a real nosedive. Do yourself a favor and limit your Refreshments collection to the first CD only."
4,another good one,"Although this CD is not as good as Fizzy Fuzzy Big and Buzzy, it is still great. It's a great CD to relax to. The hooks are once again catchy and I can safely say that I reccommend it."
1,Not built to last,"Great concept - too bad the tab insert broke after just four gentle uses, causing the tape to retract into the unit rendering it useless. Also difficult to get an accurate reading. You are supposed to insert the tab and press the button to take up the slack - I tried it several times while in place and the slack adjustment differed by as much as 3/4""."
3,good concept not built to last,Good product concept but does not last. After 40 waists measured the spring began to wear and the end of the tape began to tear.
3,"Great Concept, Poor Implementation","For anyone who has tried to measure themselves, we all know how much of a struggle that can be. This device is simple genius...create a locking mechanism to hold the other end of the tape. The only problem....on first use, the measuring tape wiggled loose from the holding pin. I was able to tape it, but of course not sure how much I have altered the measurement."
3,Strictly for Academics,"This book is strictly for academics. It is not going to be useful to those seeking a broad or introductory overview of the Roma. It is essentially a series of academic theses on sometimes obscure elements of Roma studies. The first article is about wagon painting in England and the second about Gypsy folktales (and it is strictly ABOUT folktales without actually telling any folktales, but rather discussing the oral vs. written traditions, variants, genres, etc.) Pretty dry academic material.. The book is narrowly confined by geographic area, with most of its articles discussing only British Roma without useful extrapolation to Roma communities in other countries. If you're an advanced Roma scholar seeking copies of colleagues' works, this may be right for you. If you're interested in broader information about Roma society, better to read a different book."
2,Thin plot; use your fast forward button,"It's a 1 hour plot (or shorter) dragged out to 2 hours. While watching the movie I keep fast forwarding. Even without the dialogs I could see what is moving the plot along and what is just time filler.This movie is one of those that shuffles the time line around. First you see something happening now, then you see something that happened before that, then you see something happening now, etc.If they shrink this down to about 45 minutes, it might be worth 3 stars."
5,Suspense and surprise,"If you like ""noir"" and period thrillers, Across the Hall is a movie worth watching. The suspense is gripping and the surprise is worth waiting for. The period decor is beautiful and the music is like a extra character. Well acted and Brittany is a treat. Already sadly missed."
1,Across the Mall,"Across the Hall (2009) is about a dull man seeking revenge on a cheating Brittany Murphy in a deficient attempt at film noir. This film is inadequate, inferior, and unsatisfactory on all levels. It is an insensitive love triangle gone intolerable and that is all.It's a below average film with a flawed, predictable twist. Nothing is too eye-popping about it.It's a very drudging film, too feebleminded for my brilliant tastes. None of the actors give credible performances, but the hotel assistant provides the most believable execution in his trivial role.There are no adequate actors in the entire film, and the majority of the film was shot in an indistinct studio hotel, mainly on the inside.If you're bored, read a book. Skip it."
1,Really don't waste your money,"While there is sufficient eye candy for most teenagers, a pretty girl, a creepy motel with a equally creepy bellhop etc, the story line is sub-standard. The whole movie was in a word, predictable. It is a premise that in my opinion has been done to death IE: Guy steals his friends girl / friend wants revenge / sets up the guy for the fall... The actors however, are reasonable, notably the eerie / half-crazy bell boy (who steals the show IMO) & most of the acting is fine. In fact, top notch in a few places but the material is just BAD & their acting wasted on this plot-less drivel. The movie aims to be clever but falls pathetically short of the mark.If you liked ""B"" 1950 style drive-ins you'll love the plot line. If not stay away, rent something else & pray the actors can get other jobs (and smarter agents) after this."
3,Dragged Out,"Movie was dragged out way too long. The beginning felt especially slow. Some of the flashbacks/jumping time were confusing. Overall not that bad of a movie, but too slow for my taste."
2,STYLE AND DISJOINTED,"The movie credits starts out as if you were watching a 1960's mystery. The 1920's style hotel and eerie bell hop/ desk clerk gives the movie a surreal Sin City feeling. I was all set up thinking I was going to watch a great movie. Then it happens...the flashbacks. This movie shows you what has happened then uses flashbacks to eventually bring you up to that point, but in a way you didn't expect. Sometimes this works well in a film, sometimes not, especially in this one when you don't know if a scene is a flashback or not until later. This makes the movie confusing and disjointed."
3,BE CAREFUL WHO YOU CHEAT WITH,A good film noir attempt set in a sleazy hotel with an odd porter. COLD CASE star Danny Pino plays a neurotic man who believes girlfriend Brittany Murphy is cheating on him and follows her to the Riverview Hotel and waits across the hall to see who her lover is. Pino enlists his best friend Mike Vogel to help him after a tragedy occurs.There are some plotholes and improbable actions but the movie held my interest and Pino and Vogel are quite good. Nice effort from the first time director.
3,Wild Child,"While I have many of Enya's CD's, and immensely enjoy her music, I was disappointed in the ""Wild Child"" CD. I was not disappointed by the music, but rather by the limited number of tracks on the CD - three to be exact, with a total playing time of just over 9 minutes. With [this price], I certainly would have expected a ""full"" CD. Even though I may have only myself to blame, for not reading the full description, ""Wild Child"" is not a good deal - especially since the same songs appear on her other (full length)CD's."
5,Share No Secrets Book,"Excellent book, suspenseful, a definite page turner, the characters come to life. Received in perfect condition, and quick and easy transaction."
1,"Just another ""See what I did"" book","This book is just a walkthrough of an simple example eCommerce site implemented in Java. The farther you go in the book, the more you begin to wonder just how many eCom sites the authors have really built.If you are really looking for a book titled something like ""Look How I cobbled Together My First e-Commerce Site Using Java"" then this book is for you. Otherwise, skip it."
1,Poor reliability and poor service support,"I purchased this for backup and emergencies. After only three or four uses during the first year, the tire inflater burned out. The company only warranties it for 6 months and would not replace it even thought it was barely used. I don't know whether the other components work because I never had a need to use them.This raises two concerns. First is the question of reliability if components burn out after a few uses. Second is the question of customer service. If these units are used very infrequently, shouldn't the warranty be longer? In summary, shouldn't we expect the units to last longer? If not, the buyers should be aware that the units are not reliable and not supported by the company."
4,A wonderful book with keen observations of animal behavior,"Each chapter is about a day's adventure of one of the animals (Weasel, Sierra Grouse, Chickaree, Black Bear, Lizard, Coyote, Deer Mouse, Stellar Jay & Mule Deer) on the rock and surrounding forests and meadows. Sally Carrighar compresses her observations into one day and weaves a fine tale of the activities and imagined-thoughts of each animal."
3,Slightly disappointed,"After Snail Scott's review, there's not much to say, as she gives an excellent and in my opinion, accurate overview of the book.I myself was disappointed, however. A few factual errors are indicative: zinc is NOT an alkaline earth, but a transition metal; and while magnesite is ideally magnesium carbonate, not all magnesium carbonate is magnesite, that is, the two are NOT synonymous. Also, I was perplexed by the insistence on using zinc oxide in nearly all the bases; not only is it expensive, but it also has a powerful (and usually undesirable) effect on most colourants.Maybe I just got used to superb glaze references, and was expecting more. Even so ... a decent buy, and it gave me a few good ideas, but I'm slightly regretting having bought it. (I would, however, recommendClay and Glazes for the PotterandThe Ceramic Spectrum: A Simplified Approach to Glaze and Color Development.)"
4,helpful for the hobbyist....,"This book is useful for those hobbyist who are getting into glaze development and may not know all the permutations available for glazes. It is nice in that the color tiles often portray the effects of graded additions, allowing the beginner to see trends of effects produced by various components. I found this book helpful, and also agree with the other review about some factual errors and UK slant."
4,"Edgy, underplayed","Walberg did a good job. It's a watchable movie. Underplayed performances add an element of likable realism. I like this a lot better than some of the overblown Hollywood thrillers out there. You could do a lot worse than with ""The Yards""."
3,Mediocre...,"If honestly, I decided to give this drama showing the murky ""underbelly"" of railway corporations business a try only because J Phoenix's name was on the ads poster. He was OK, as well as overall performance of the cast was - M Wahlberg, Sh Teron & Co. However, I would refrain from showering this movie with such adjectives as ""gritty"", ""thrilling"" and ""enticing"", if only you are not a member of some railway trade union: the movie lacks pace and characters (besides Phoenix's) are not very convincing, some scenes are transparently pathetic. And personally I never got the idea why M Wahlberg's character has been sent to prison before.Besides some 2-3 outbursts of short action on the screen, the rest of the time you will be whistling or reading newspaper on your coach. It seems that all actors involved were having a poor choice of scripts when agreeing to act in this movie. Don't waste your time."
1,Boreing,I read a few of the reviews for this movie and thought I would give it a try. I should have taken the advise of (do not watch) even James Cann couldnt pull this one out of the pits. Save your money if your looking for something interesting or involves any action. Even the part where the the policeman gets whacked on the head and the yard boss got stabbed was mediocre at best.
2,Uninspired crime drama,"After watching the movie and reading the reviews, I felt compelled to say something. The plot synopsis gives an adequate idea of what the movie is about, but not how it is told-which is dull."
2,Poor at Best,"I have this little (very little) section in my dvd bookcase that houses bad dvd buys. Currently ""The Yards"" and ""Ghost World"" are the only two dvds that are housed on that shelf. I don't know what to say, except the preview at best buy drove me to buy it on the spot and I was extremely disappointed that night when I watched it. Slow story, not enough character development. All I can say is don't let it be a dust collector in your dvd collection, like mine is."
1,"Good cast, bad film","I was astounded that a cast this good could make a film this bad. The story is both boring and ridiculous, the sentimentality is overdone, the filming is awkward, the characters are really, really dumb, the script is stilted, and even the acting is disappointing. A movie about unconvincing people who are too dumb to breathe, let alone run businesses and commit crimes."
4,GRITTY DRAMA,"After spending time in prison for auto theft, Leo (Mark Wahlberg), decides it's time to go the straight and narrow.Returning home from prison, Leo, takes a job at his uncle Frank's (James Caan) company working on contracts with the New York City subway system.Once on the job, Leo, meets his uncle's top guy (Joaquin Phoenix), and before long, he realizes his uncle is involved with corruption, and payoffs.""The Yards"" is a gritty drama that sports an excellent cast;Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron, James Caan, Ellen Burstyn, and Faye Dunaway. Although, slowly paced, the film puts a smart, and interesting spin on big city corruption. Very much a character driven film, ""The Yards"" will disappoint those looking for fast action. But anyone looking for an intelligent, well acted movie will be pleased with this one.Nick Gonnella"
2,Cute but Low quality,"The fabric is VERY thin, and the plastic pieces that are included for putting the wheels on snapped as my husband was putting it together, so he had to rig it up. Cute, but I bet it won't last long."
5,Graco Outridder Doll Stroller,I bought this product for my 18 month old granddaughter. She loves to take her favorite teddy for a walk. It is light weight and easy for her to maneuver. She diligently Velcro's the seat strap to ensure the bear's safety. The canopy and package holder add to the realism and play value.
4,Very Good Toy,"I bought this toy in June for my daughter's 2nd birthday, and she absolutely loves it! All the other little girls in the neighborhood are always asking to play with it."
5,Call Graco if a part is broken!,I have purchased a Graco stroller in the past and had the same issue when assembling with the wheel. The plastic pieces when snapping it on broke. I called Graco and they sent a new one. That one broke too. They also replaced that one. Haven't had a problem with that stroller since. (It was the higher end model). My daughters love it so much I am going to purchase this one for my younger daughters B-Day so we don't fight over our one stroller. Hope this Help!
3,The Best of Warrant?,"The Best of Warrant gathers tracks from their three Columbia records releases Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich,Cherry Pie,and Dog Eat Dog.All three of these albums are very solid albums that should be heard in their entirety. I would mainly recommend this CD for people who are on a tight budget and can't afford to buy the individual albums.The biggest singles are here, as well as the cover of Queen's We Will Rock You but most people that enjoy the hit singles would probably enjoy most of the album tracks on the individual albums as well. This disc includes such hits as:Heaven,Sometimes She Cries,Down Boys,Cherry Pie,Uncle Tom's Cabin,I Saw Red (an alternate acoustic version,the original version is better),Machine Gun, and Hole in My Wall.The Music 5 Stars,but trying to gather all of Warrants essential songs onto only 1 Disc 3 Stars,a good starting point,but buy D.R.S.F.R.,Cherry Pie,and Dog Eat Dog as well."
4,Good stuff... but..,"I always wonder who chooses the songs that make ""greatest hits"" albums. Is it the studio, the band, the fans, a whore on the street? It's a mystery. Why songs like ""The Bitter Pill"" and ""I Saw Red (original version)"" were dismissed for the likes of ""Machine Gun"" and ""Thin Disguise"" I'll never understand.. there are a couple other issues with choices like ""Mr. Rainmaker"" appearing on the album instead of something like ""Big Talk"" which Warrant actually has a music video for. It's as bad as not including ""Down Boys"" and including ""Cold Sweat"".. which didnt happen thankfully, but you get the idea. I think before a greatest hits ablum is produced, production companies should have a website that ""fans"" can vote on. That way at least the people that supported bands like Warrant all along can have a say in the matter. ""Thin Disguise"" was a b-side track that was on the cassette single with ""Cheery Pie"" why is it on this ""hits"" cd..? Get my drift?"
3,leaves off where Warrant should have left off,"The only good songs from the first two albums are here. This best of shows how good Warrant used to be before Jani went Jacko Wacko and became a drunk. Unfortunately, two songs from the awful Dog Eat Dog album are two too many. Why not put that Jane's Addiction rip off song they got sued over instead? And just why do we need to hear Warrant screw up a Queen song? At least they spared us the ultra awful ultraphobic and the other grunge lite crap."
5,Warrant,The item was shipped quickly and in good shape. Very hard to find this cd till i found it here.
3,Warrant where did they go?,This group had a good future ahead of them. I really liked the way they did a ballad like I saw red and also Heaven. Overall this cd was alright but I would have liked to heard more from this group than I have.
4,Hair-Nation,"The best track on the disc is ""uncle toms cabin"". Sirius 23, Hair Nation has it rated as their #4 80's metal songs. ROCK ON, Warrant! Other awesome songs include ""mr. rainmaker"", and the crowd favorites ""heaven"", ""cherry pie"" and ""sometimes she cries"". The whole disc is awesome if you into 80's metal."
3,Could be much better...,"I always rate ""best of"" and ""hits"" cds by how close them come to what I'd make myself. This one misses ""Blind Faith"" and the original version of ""I Saw Red"" from Cherry Pie. I'd also put on ""Bitter Pill"" and ""Let It Rain"" from the third cd Dog Eat Dog (their best). Also check out Ultrphobic, it's a great album. For casual or new fans, this cd is the one to get though."
2,For novices only,Well I recieved this book and after 20 second of skimming i was highly disapointed. This book is for the most novice or wire working abilities. Unless you have never made a wrapped loop i wouldnt recomend this book. Most of the tutorials in this book are covered online as they are the most basic of abilities used in wire work.
3,This book is ok,This book is ok I don't think it has enough information in it. It should have more patterns in it. I would have loved it if it would have the different chains you can make with wire.
5,Beginner Basics - Yes!,"Having absolute no experience in wire working, I was eager to find a book that would teach me the basics in a simple straight-forward way. THIS IS THE BOOK!All Wired Up was written for someone who has the desire to learn, but doesn't know where to start. Large illustrations and easy to follow instructions guide the novice in learning the Basics from simple loops-stars (which for some reason I just cannot make) to Basic Projects, Findings, Ear Wires, Clasps (really easy) and Cages for beads/stones/marbles/or?)The Contemporary Wirework shown at the end of the book is inspiring and does require much more knowledge of wirework; however, it does inspire the beginner to learn more and try harder to create their own wirework masterpieces. At least, it inspired me to do so."
5,Fantastic book for beginners!,I purchased this book not knowing a thing about jewelry making and yet was able to create a lovely necklace in just a couple of hours. The instructions are very clearly written and the accompanying diagrams are quite useful. If you are at all interested in creating your own wire jewelry then this book is a must!
5,The best primer on making wire jewelry,"All Wired Up teaches the basics of wire wrapping with detail, clarity and a sense of humor. He also includes tips on safety and posture. Even though it's geared toward the absolute beginner, skilled wire workers and teachers will still find it useful. In addition to making loops, you'll learn to make your own earwires & findings and to make caged beads. These are the skills that will be used over and over again. The gallery at the end shows the different ways of making wire jewelry such as wire sculpture, free form, and jig work. (There are no instructions but most of the contributors have their own websites). There are other wire jewelry making books out there but this is the one to start with and purchase first, then the others will make sense."
4,lovely photographs,"This book has lovely photographs of work by contemporary wire artists. Easy to follow directions in the front section of the book are for the true beginner with little or no experience working with wire, and cover only the basics. The photos of the work in the back of the book are truly inspiring, creative pieces- too advanced for the beginner to tackle, but a great resource for ideas for the experienced wire artist. It would have been great to have more advanced technical advice for those of us already working in wire."
4,Very Enjoyable!,"I must admit, I was a little skeptical before purchasing this CD on Ebay for seven dollars. Wow! It's great! When I first heard Keystudio I didn't really ""understand"" it. The more I played it the better it sounded. (I especially love Steve Howe's guitar playing and sound) I have now added my eleventh Yes CD to my collection. My favorite track is #6, ""That, That Is"". If you're into YES you might want to give this recording a try."
2,Did their Muse get tired?,"I think these songs are not as good as their earlier compositions. Mostly the first song: it's monotonous and lacks melody. The rest are just ok. None took my breath away like ""Pictures for an exhibition"", or ""Henry VIII"", or ""Close to the edge""... first time this happens to me with my favorite group."
4,Works ok but a bit scary,The mains adapter makes a soft hissing sound on 240V. I wonder whether it will eventually catch fire or melt.
4,Lots of Fun,"I got this comic book, read in fifteen minutes and really found it a fun way to look at what could've happened in the SW universe. I am looking forward the TESB Infinities (and maybe they could do one for TPM - maybe kill off Binks!)"
4,Solid Reading for Star Wars fans,"If you are one of those folks with a vivid imagination and have played ""what if"" scenarios in your mind for Star Wars: ANH over the years, this comic is good for you.The story is generally solid and the artwork is decent. The book only gets 4 stars though for the end parts, which I found a little strange with a little bit of unexplained information.But still worth it for most star wars fans!"
3,Intersting concept that falls a little short,"For the hardcore Star Wars junkie the appeal of the 'Infinites' series is immediately apparent. Who amongst us isn't curious to see how alternative scenarios would've played out in the Star Wars universe should certain key events not have taken place. In this volume readers are presented with the intriguing scenario on what happens when Luke Skywalker fails to blow up the Death Star as we've come to know based on events in Episode IV. Readers are taken through an epic arc that would've encompassed 3 full movies but somehow seem boiled down to general thumbnail sketches thanks to the cramming of this storyline into four issues of 22 page comics. Surely this series should've been stretched out a bit more to fill in the blanks and to embellish the drama a bit more.With that being said, it's still worth your while to read through this series if you find the idea of such alternate-scenarios in the Star Wars universe to be of interest."
5,A New Star Wars Story,"This is the Star Wars like you never read beforeWith this Expanded Universe Graphic novels you can take the chance to visualize an ""what if...."" Ending with a new and endless possibilities.In this version of ANH the Death Star didn't explode cause the torpedo didn't work, try to imagine the rest of the story. Well instead read it here!!!!!"
2,nobody noticed,"i'm surprised nobody noticed that if luke did miss wouldnt the death star have blown up the planet since that was what it was about to do before it was blown up.so if luke had missed,the death star would have blown up the planet yavin with leia on it and han and luke surely would have been killed by the imperial fleet with nowhere to run.so this story what if couldnt really happen cause there is too many holes.mainly the big one being leia would be dead since she was on the planet when the death star was about to fire and was saved by luke hitting the target shaft.surprised nobody mentions this on the reviews."
4,dock ladder,"It was pretty much what I expected. One thing is difficult - tightening the nuts, which go under the dock."
3,Needs better description,"This is a well done film on mid-1920s China, and focused on one of the more interesting warlords - Feng Yu-hsiang - ""the Christian General."" Problem is this is disk 1, and you are left hanging. Hopefully a Chinese speaker will step in and tell us if this is part of a made-for-tv mini series, and how many additional disks complete the story."
4,One of best 80's bands,"Men At Work were an MTV Staple of the early 80's. With their tongue in cheek music videos, wailing saxaphone, electronic synthesizers, and awesome accents, this band was definitely a huge act of the new wave era. This album has two huge singles: the paranoid ""Who Can It Be Now?"" and the upbeat ""Land Down Under"", both which have the band keeping the tongue firmly in the cheek with their silly lyrics and sense of humor intact. There is one more single on here that came towards the tail end of their reign, ""Overkill"", which is pretty good, though not as strong as the other two singles. After that, the songs vary from fair to poor. The two big singles are good enough to give the album four stars, one star docked for the uneven music on the rest of the album. Once new wave left, this band did as well, which is too bad because after listening to ""Land Down Under"", you won't have that song out of your head for a long time."
3,Pretty much everything...,"Men At Work were one of those bands that had some really good stuff, but at the time MTV was where most people went for music, and there was so much material on the station at the time that Men At Work sort of got lost in the shuffle. They had two major scores with ""Down Under"" and ""Who Can It Be Now"", and both of these are good solid pop/rock tunes. They had a few other overlooked gems; ""Dr. Heckyl and Mr. Jive"", ""It's A Mistake"", and my personal favorite ""Overkill"". People heard them, but they dissolved quickly and apparantly lacked the staying power of the first two hits.Nonetheless, ""Contraband"" is a good, if a bit bloated collection of a somewhat underrated band. The bulk of their 3 major label releases are present, and the quality of some of these songs that are appearing on their ""Best of"" kinda shows why they eventually threw in the towel (more or less). When they were good they were good, but it wasn't all the time."
4,One of the Greatest Bands of the Early 80's,"Excellent...I was in high school when Men At Work burst onto the scene. ""Business as Usual"" is still one of my favorite recordings. Thank goodness this greatest hits includes ""Down by the Sea""...probably their best effort despite no air play in the US"
3,Pretty good songs.,"Men at Work has always been a pretty good band. Colin Hay's vocals are pretty unique. I remember listening to a cassette of Cargo many years ago. I like most of the stuff on this compilation; a few of the songs sound like filler though. The ones that I like are ""Still Life,"" ""Dr. Heckyll & Mr. Jive,"" and ""Overkill."" I do like some of the others, but these are my favorites. I have never been a big fan of Men at Work, but there's no doubt that they are respectable musicians and songwriters."
3,Their hits are good... but there aren't THAT many of them...,"I had great memories of Men at Work from my high school days in the '80s. I really wanted some of their hits in my collection, especially those that only occasionally play on the radio, like ""Overkill."" They aren't available on iTunes at this writing, so I had to buy a CD.I like Track 1, ""Who Can It Be Now?"". I've always loved Track 2, ""Down Under."" Also like their other hits, ""It's a Mistake,"" ""Be Good Johnny,"" ""Dr. Heckyll And Mr. Jive,"" and the aforementioned ""Overkill.""Music is subjective, so others may feel differently... but personally I don't care if I never hear any of the other songs again. They're all B sides in my mind.If you can hold out for the day when ""Men at Work"" hits are available for legal download, I'd suggest doing so. But if you can't wait to own the great songs from one of the most famous early-80s bands, it's worth your money to buy this album."
3,Great songs! Both of 'em!,"Here's the skinny on this album: the recognizable tune list is aweful thin. When I bought CONTRABAND, I knew and loved two of its songs, ""Who Can It Be Now?"" and ""Down Under"", and I was hoping to discover a few more MEN AT WORK gems. In my humble opinion, there aren't any more. Musically, the boys from the land down under hit huge home-runs with their two chart-toppers, but didn't have much else to fall back on.Still, with the strength of those two favorites, I still feel like I got my money's worth."
5,Great Then. Great Now.,"Who Can it Be Now, Overkill, Down Under, It's a Mistake, Be Good Johnny....great songs back in the 80s and great songs now. The downloads are good quality and not live."
4,This collection shows the band's strengths,"""Who Can It Be Now?"" and ""Down Under"" were two of the catchier songs of the 80's. The former being a nice paranoid's anthem, the second leading to a love of all things from the land of OZ. But there is more to recommend this band than a few hit singles. From the kid who just doesn't fit in (""Be Good Johnny"") to a bit of concern about the world's inherent self-destructiveness (""It's a Mistake"") Men At Work had range, a tight sound, and a depth that was not seen if you only knew the singles. Listen to Colin Hay on ""Snakes and Ladders"" and you know this guy can put across a song. Closing with the haunting ""Down By The Sea,"" this is one greatest hits package that serves a real purpose, a chance for people to hear a bit more than ""men who chunder."""
1,Good Tunes BAD Sound Quality,This is a decent collection of tunes by the band (I might have picked some others though). The sound quality is very bad though. This CD was mastered in such a way that there is extensive digital clipping (i.e. distortion) that is very noticable (especially on some of the drum beats).If you care about sound quality then I would pass on buying this CD and look at the other releases by this band.
4,Great CD,Definitely worth having. Great music to move to while doing housework and had to stop a few times and dance around the house. My 9 yr old son thought I was nuts. Oh well....after the 80's....maybe I am.
5,One of Australia's best exports,"This compilation is great. Men at Work made some great music and it's collected here. All of the songs are good. In addition to being good, with melodies that catch in the head, the songs make the listener think some too. There's intellectual and emotional impact to them. I liked these guys as a kid and I like this CD a lot now. Great buy, especially for 80s kids."
4,Preacher,"I have to admit that I was a fan of the two songs that got all the airplay so many years ago. When I ordered this disc, I was really planning to include those two songs on a playlist that is contained in my IPOD.What I found was a refreshing look at this truly remakable band. Jam up lyrics, awesome vocals, and great music all add up to a wonderful collection of hits.This is a must have for any Men at Work fan or casual listener."
5,I Love the Old Stuff,"What can I say, if you like Men at Work...then you like them. I had their albums and such, but I am trying to rebuild a digital library of music now. This group just adds to my collection. It is a solid album."
4,Great Work!,"Vanessa has really over done her self this time. I mean this girl has it all; the looks, the voice and the talent! I really love the song ""Who were you thinkin' 'bout"" and ""Happiness"". This truly is her ""come back "" album. It is sad that this album did not get much popularity. I am a teacher and I play some of these songs to my students during study time or even tests( it really relaxes them). And, I think I have introduced them back to Vanessa(they all have a copy of NEXT.."
2,Next...NEXT! (The Comfort Zone was WAY better),"This album isn't even average, great or spectacular, it's just an album. The only good song on the album is ""Happiness"" the rest are so boring that I just took the CD back and got a refund. I recommend her second album ""The Comfort Zone"" that is the most beautiful album she has ever made. This album is not. Also, I recommend Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope, now THAT'S A WORK OF ART."
2,Not one of her best,"Vanessa's fourth album ""Next"" sounded uneven to me. A couple of songs are okay, but there's not a continuity like the other albums before it. I liked ""Happiness"" and how Jam & Lewis were able to interpolate Nu Shooz's 1985 song ""I Can't Wait"" into that song and place a funky beat under it. But the rest of the album has too many forgettable songs within it and the ballads lack punch to me. Such an uneven joint music wise when you listen to it now."
3,Pleasant But Uninspired,"Vanessa Williams' fourth studio effort finds her returning to a more straightforward musical landscape after the more ambitious work of her last set THE SWEETEST DAYS. Though the album has its' moments('Happiness','Oh How The Years Go By','Lost Without You'), it ulitmately fails for the most part due to the fact that the songs aren't nearly as distinctive as those on DAYS or her sterling COMFORT ZONE album--many seem like decent, yet generic castoffs hidden under slick production. As usual, she's in top vocal form, which helps hold some interest, but not enough to make this anything more than an album of pleasant but mostly uninspired filler."
3,"Almost there, but not quite!","Cultural Tourism prove to be really interesting reading material. This book is nice to carry around, in that it is not very large. The author is almost there, in writing a textbook that people can actually enjoy reading. For the most part, the author is concise, but in some areas the book is just too wordy. For a topic such as cultural tourism, I think this textbook would be much better if it was in color and included more photos. Much of the content would be comprehended better with images to compliment the writings.All and all it is one of the better textbooks I have read, but not quite there."
5,"Really good, but...","This box set is a handy collection of Blue Oyster Cult's first three albums, collectively known as the ""black-and-white period"", when the band was a cult attraction nevertheless drawing increasing attention. These three records, which contain standards like 'Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll', 'The Red and the Black' and 'Career of Evil', form the core of the evidence for BOC's being the ultimate ""thinking man's metal band"". The only thing is that, since this box was released, all three of these albums have been remastered and re-released with bonus tracks and new liner notes, so this collection is a bit outdated. By all means, however, it is worth checking out these classic albums in practically any form."
4,A review from a younger fan,"I'm only 18, and discovered Blue Oyster Cult last year, havingbought ""Workshop of the Telescopes"" on a whim. I wasimpressed by that, and now I am impressed by these three CD's, conveniently available for one low price. My fave of the three is probably the self-titled debut album, because the songwriting is catchy, and the singer has that drugged out rasp I like so much. Secret Treaties runs a VERY close second. The songs are just as good, a little closer to a traditional hard rock sound, but the production is lacking, and sometimes an annoying feedback keeps coming through that kind of annoys me. Still, this is a great album. I'm not that hot on ""Tyranny and Mutation"", but since you're essentially getting it for free, it's worth it for Hot Rails to Hell, and Baby Ice Dog. Anyway, BOC are an amazing band, and this is a good way to get exposed to a good chunk of their work. For new fans, I strongly reccomend Workshop of the Telescopes."
5,Three letters: B . . . O . . . C,"Okay. This is the scoop: The best F.... band in the world, and their three best albums together. What more can you ask for? I mean, it doesn't get any better than this! If you love great music, than check these out! B.O.C. is the best!"
1,"""2"" Easy","I was in love with the first game so I thought the second would be the perfect next step. I have never been more wrong.I'm not a particularly fit or active person and I still find that these workouts are simple and boring. My set workouts don't even take 10 minutes, and I can't find a way to extend the workout duration. That <10 minutes even includes extra time while the game forces you to watch your ""trainer"" display terribly cheesy facial expressions and encouraging gestures. After EVERY exercise. Rather than encouraging me to keep working out, it frequently encourages me to pick a different method of exercising.This was a huge disappointment. It might as well have been marketed under a different title completely, because it was barely comparable to the first at all, let alone being a satisfying upgrade."
2,TOO SLOW,"For the most part this video is easy, but I found it too slow. It is definitely not aerobic. There is too much time between each exercise while the instructor is moving from one exercise to another and then the reps are pretty slow as well. It works some muscle groups well, but it is not at all what I expected & there are definitely too few different exercises. I can not do push-ups and it is difficult to get the game to skip this exercise. I will use it, but not as often as others I already had."
1,too slow for my liking,I am used to Wii Active that goes from on exercise to the other. This one was a little slow and the work outs are too short to be of any realy benefit.
2,not as good as the first my fitness coach game,"My Fitness Coach 2 isn't as good as the first one. Although they have incorporated the wii balance board in this one, the first one is still the best one if you want to keep track of how many calories you burn and choose wich part of the body you want to work out. also the first one keeps steady track of how much work out time you have left this one does not."
1,Not as good as the original,"I bought this game thinking that it would be an extension of the first, with new exercises and tips, but found that is entirely a new game altogether. I love the original game because it does not require me to use controllers, this one does and it does not register your movements as quickly as it needs to. I plan on keeping the game, and will use it occasionally to add variety to my routine; but would not recommend it as a primary fitness game."
1,My fitness Coach 2,I was very disappointed in the game. I really like my fitness coach (1) you really get a work out. There are no pauses in the game like my fitness coach 2. Granted they have 4 different trainers you can chose from but they will show you one move you conduct that move then you wait till you get the next instructions. I really didn't like this because you really don't get a work out. If you want a good work out I suggest my fitness coach (the first version)
1,Not at all what I expected!,"I thought this would be an actual upgrade from the original My Fitness Coach w/new exercises music, landscapes, etc. Instead, it's an entirely new game and nothing I would have ever purchased. Lousy! I work out regularly and give this game Two thumbs down. Back to using My Fitness Coach original."
2,Wii my coach fitness,"not that many exercises in it, prefer the Wii Fitbut good for recipes, not what i bought it for!"
2,should be much better,"The overall idea of the game is good. But Very poor interaction with the wii fit board and controller. Contacted their tech support. They have to be one of the worst out there. The directed me to read three different forums, one being their own, none had any titles for the product!It alternates between your two goals you pick. The general progression is good it will back off when you flatten out and then step it up again when you progress. Also, it does have some good ideas for meals."
1,Horrible,"I really thought this was going to be great. Was I wrong. The first one is so much better. They really should of kept the same concept of the first one, but incorporate new things to make it better, like different animated trainers and different places to train and harder workouts. I hated the graphics on the second one. It looked so fake. The trainers to me were very annoying. I didn't like that it used the balance board and the wii remote. I found that you really had to swing the remote high in the air if you were jogging, or it didn't count. The balance board also didn't recognize that I was doing the push ups. Very annoying. I don't know if anybody else had this problem, but I am definately bringing this back."
2,Not worth the money !,"I had such high hopes for this sequel to My Fitness Coach. My hopes were shattered. I bought this without reading any reviews or seeing any information about what the game was about. Won't make that mistake again. All of the functionality that was in the previous version is no longer here (select length of workout, what exercise you want to do, change the level, change the music, etc.). You do not have much control at all over your workouts. I am a fit person so I need something that challenges me. The previous version still challenges me. The 2nd version barely gives you any workout. Even those who never exercise will get any benefit from this. My advice, do not spend your money on this! This is yet another one of UBISOFT's disappointments (just like Your Shape)."
2,Not very good.,"I don't care for this game. It is flat and boring, it doesn't keep track of when I work out, it just keeps it's own schedule. I do not recommend."
2,For beginners only,"If you are new to working out or have been out of a routine for awhile, say 15 years or more, then you may want to consider this game. For someone like me who starts and stops exercise routines multiple times a year, this game is a complete waste of money. When I start a workout, I like to do that to the end. I do not like to stop for more time than a specific exercise to get rated and praised. Praise from a video game sound is just as hollow as getting a certificate in class for best teeth.Then there are the menus. Sure it is nice to have ideas of healthy meals. Just try to cook them though. There is no way to print the menus and I really don't like the idea of having to drag the television and Wii setup to the kitchen. As for finding old recipes that you liked, good luck.If you can do fast walk for over 20 minutes, It is just not worth the money."
1,Complete waste of money,My wife and I had the original MFC and when we saw MFC2 we were excited thinking they took the old one and added some new things... WRONG! I can barely get warmed up doing the workout programs and the constant stopping between workouts is just annoying. The best part of the first MFC was the fact it was a cardio workout so you actually were burning more calories and toning because you were going at it full force with short rests towards the end. The MFC2 game is nothing more the Wii fit with out the balance games and added nutrition information that is readily available online. If you played the original like my wife and I stay away from this game. You will be extremely disappointed and just wasting money. Since you have a balance board you'd have Wii Fit or Wii Fit Plus and so you already have what this game offers for quality of work out.To end on a positive the graphics were extremely improved from the first.
3,Not better than the first. Could have done better.,"The first one was perfect in that you could incorporate fitness equipment you had on hand. This one used the Wii Fit Board...I like that...and the Wii remote to track your progress. Sometimes you swear you are doing it right, and it doesn't pick it up. There is no other way to change the difficulty level other than start a new profile. I like the addition of live people as the trainers, but I wish the instructions were a bit more detailed for each excercise. I like it, but don't love it. They should have worked on it a bit more and made it more like the original but updated. I'd save my cash and get EA Fit or Wii Fit Plus. The shopping list/meal planner and the fact it weighs you are a definite plus, but not enough to make it worth the [...]."
2,Disappointed!,"Why can't someone make a great work out for the WII? My Fitness Coach, the original, is SO CLOSE to ""just right"" that I had to try this one. The daily workouts consist of 8 exercises....that's it. And if the controller doesn't communicate with the unit, well, eventually it becomes annoying. I was hoping for a good workout that could progressively get more challenging as I got better. I need the ""company"" during my workouts to help me keep focused and motivated. This is just not the tool I was looking for. Even with its minor flaws, the original is still the best one for the money. I'm really disappointed!"
1,Biggest Disappointment Ever!,I love My Fitness Coach and couldn't wait for the follow up. The creators only needed to add some workout moves and update the graphics/backgrounds and they would have had gold but no they revamped the whole thing. Don't bother buying My Fitness Coach 2 it will only disappointment and the cheesy thumbs up from the trainers only adds insult to injury. (Hey creators... start on 3 and go back to the original format with a few more moves and poses. You owe us!)
3,not worthy of the name.. :(,"this is basicaly another one of those Wii Fit Plus knockoffs... completely unworthy of its name :(COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME FROM MY FITNESS COACH 1, Totally completely different, this is basically Wii Fit Plus 2 without cute characters...what a huge disappointment... I was hoping for My Fitness coach with more exercises, bigger buttons, with ability of incorporating balance board..."
1,Waste of $30,This is not a workout.... by the time each exercise actually gets started (tons of lag time between exercises) you heart rate is down. All bells & whistles and no substance. The Biggest Loser Wii is MUCH MUCH better.
1,THIS IS A BAIT AND SWITCH!!!,The shoe looks cool on amazon.com but when it arives at your house it has white laces and does not look as good as it does on the web. I contacted footlocker/champ sports and it was a huge hassle anyway I did eventually get my money back and a $50 gift card for footlocker wich I used to replace these shoes with a much more expensive pair. you should think if you would like this shoe with white laces then this may be the shoe for you!
1,Smith Hardware III bait and switch,"the shoes are the exact ones pictured, however they dont have the blue indego laces that are pictured. instead they sent me the shoes with white laces when I complained, their customer service reps lied and told me that the laces were in the mail but they never arrived, after I called them again, they overnighted me the same white laces I already had. they did eventually let me return the shoes at thier store in the city next to mine and sent me a gift card to fix the problem but they will not be fixing the picture or the description."
4,Gives backbone to the old Bond books!,"This very historical and informative book is right at home in any spy-story collection. Filled with tactics, codenames, secret missions and even a few racy women counterparts, this book will thrill the action/mystery lover!"
4,Excellent Book - Must Read,This book helps everyone understand they are a leader. It also helps you to find out where you may want to lead.
1,60 Minutes -- The Great Migration,"Please don't waste your money purchasing this video. It is approximately 12 minutes long and was taken directly from the 60 Minutes program on CBS. This didn't just disappoint me, it made me angry. I was ripped off!"
5,"Excellent Job on ""One""","L.S. Keilbart and her illustrator have done a fantastic job of creating for children, in an entertaining way, an excellent lesson on sharing and working together. I recommend this book highly to anyone with young children."
3,Lisa Jankovic,"I did not know what to expect when I bought this movie. But I really enjoyed it.Elizabeth Shannon shines in her role as Sam. I must admit I never really liked her in the American Pie movies, but this movie has really changed my opinion of her.A cute movie that anyone who enjoys a wedding and everything that comes along with it."
3,Fun,This is a fun movie. It is movie good to spend spare time but not one that you have to see. Only for fun not a trscendental movie.
1,The 1st DVD that I ordered from you did not read on my two DVD players so I ordred another one as you can see from my account,I was very disappointed with my first purchase but now I have one that works!
4,Good quality,"These are probably the highest quality keystone inserts made. They do exactly what they're supposed to do, which is to hold keystone jacks."
5,Awesome,"I know you're not supposed to use words like ""awesome"" to describe music that is so sparse and simple in instrumentation and arrangement, but it's absolutely accurate. Stacey is clearly a very talented songwriter -- I just discovered she (co)wrote ""For Years,"" a wonderful song cut a few years back by Sammy Kershaw. And she has a sweet voice (much better than her brother's, IMHO) that is just right for her songs. Listen to this CD and be moved."
5,The Best Book Ever,"Well to me i'm not all exctited about reading ,but after I read this book it really amazed me so much. Being able to explore the wild side of books like this is really a pleasant to me and the rest of my friends. Bob Dylan you are the best and I recommend anybody to read the book.Sophia Lewis Navasota Texas 77868 700Doris #39"
2,Buyer Beware,"The CD was advertised as ""like new"" cond.. The CD cover looked pretty good as did the plastic casing and the ""picture-side"" of the CD. BUT-all you had to do was LOOK at the Shiny-side of the CD to see that they all looked pretty crappy. There were 3 CDs. They ranged from avg. to really bad, visually. They were not at all ""like new"".I'll cut her some slack because I did not listen to the tracks. Maybe they were OK, and maybe not. BUT, they certainly didn't look the part of ""like new cond.""The reason I was so perturbed was that I noticed another review while these were in transit, which said about the same thing as I was critiquing. So, it seemed as if this were somewhat intentional. Perhaps this was an honest mistake, but I'd be inclined to think that it was a case of shipping it out w/o proper regard to the paying customer. My advise would be with this seller-BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Amethyst colored Silver Earring,"After wearing these earrings only a few days, I lost the stone out of one of the studs."
5,Exellent Product,"The watch arrived turned off (needed to charge up first). After just a few hours in sunlight it started ticking, keeping excellent time. My wife loves the way it looks and ECO drive means we won't have to replace the batteries every year like her old watch. I recommend this watch to anyone!"
3,"reasonable for MFC, weak on COM","If you just started to program MFC the book might be to heavy. If you are experienced, you might not find much news. If you are an intermediate or want a MFC reference than the book is OK. The ActiveX presentation is skimpy and brief. You would be better with other book on this topic."
2,"A very good overview of VC, not more","I read an older version of the book a very long time ago and did not like it.After reading it you can answer many questions about what VC CAN do and unfortunately there is very little information about how VC actually DOES it.A few months ago I came upon a newer edition of the title. It is still the same: very little about everything.You can not keep this book as a reference.If you want to be a good VC programmer and really understand what lurks behind wizzards, try some other book. Not this one."
1,Not useful at all if you're not a Windows programmer guru,"It looks like you must be an experienced C++ and Windows programmer to read this book, otherwise you don't understand anything. If I had such profile, I wouldn't need that book :) I wonder why the authors thought that in a couple of pages they could explain to people new to Windows programming such difficult things like GDI, device contexts, viewports, etc. Well, to much things to My recommendation: DON'T BUY THIS BOOK"
2,Let me tell you what they did in this book...,"They use wizard to creat a framework then add or change a few lines of code. That's it! If you are new to VC or MFC, you absolutely have no idea why these modifications. So after all you still learn nothing."
2,disappointed!!!,"after several detailed reading the book , I am completely disappointed! I began to learn MFC about three years ago, using this book for my first step. after I finished the book, yeah, I can write some codes, but I really didn't know how the codes rununder the hood! this book just tells you ,click appwizard, click this or that button, click classwizard, then click classwizard again and again! then you finish your program.the part about COM,OLE is absolutely rubbish! when I first learned COM and OLE using the book, I was completely confused!I have struggled with COM for three months , the only thing I got from Kruglinski is confusion and angry. until I turned to jeff. prosise's great book:""Programming windows with MFC""( 2nd)I found myself in MFC programming."
5,Very good book if you are ready for it!,"You should learn C++ first before learning VC++ or you will have a hard time with any good book on VC++. The number one mistake I see today is someone trying to learn MFC before learning C++.A very clear book and easy to understand if you have the sense to build your way up to this book.Do your homework, VC++ is not easy to learn it takes a long time, a lot of programming, and reading a lot of books to get good at it, lazy people will all ways complain instead of working."
5,Its still the best book for Visual C++,"You need to understand C++, and no this is not a tutorial on VC++. But if you are an intermediate VC++ programmer or guru, this book is an excellent reference. I used mine for reference so much, that I actually wore the book out and need to order another copy."
1,An exact copy of Inside Visual C++ Version 4.0!!,"I was very dissapointed when I found out that this book was an exact copy - word by word - of an earlier book 'Inside Visual C++ 4.0' except for a few new chapters on some of the newer topics in C++ 6.0, but 90% of the book is an exact duplicate.Although it is mentioned in the foreword that the book tries to maintain the style and format of the earlier book, it doesn't mention just how much style and format has been copied.If you have the earlier 'Inside Visual C++ 4.0' don't bother with this book, otherwise, I must agree that it is a rather good and thourough book on Visual C++ 6.0."
2,"Big on scope, small on detail","This book covers a lot of topics such as forms, DLLs, Database, Network programming, OLE, and more. However, the details are very minute. If you are looking to buy a book, read it, then be ready to program, this is definitely not for you. The general philosophy of this book is to briefly explain something, then give an example program. While the examples are ok, they are not useful for learning since they are not thoroughly explained.I don't know which VC++ books on the market are good, but I can tell you that this one is not."
3,"Good to learn how to code in MFC, but NO Architecture","This is a good book to learn how to code in MFC. The biggest drawback of this book is that it does not mention the MFC application architecture in the begining at all. So the reader is immediately starts coding whithout knowing what the MFc is actually doing for him. I have very strong experience in developing windows applications under the Win32 SDK and I believe that this book should have discussed the MFC message maping and application architecture before writing any code (at least). Overall, i think the book is okay. Personnely, I like ""Professional MFC With Visual C++ 6by Mike Blaszczak"" better."
3,Good for learning MFC... and that's about it.,"This book claims to be teaching almost all aspects of Visual C++ 6.0. In reality, it should be named ""Programming VC++ with MFC and Overview of the rest of the technologies."". I read this book from cover to cover and I felt good about it until I got to Part III. After that it was just boring and difficult to read it, because the style of explaination of the topic was far from the one that covered MFC. It just felt that the author(s) were in a hurry fo the deadline.In my opinion, the worst part of this book is the one that attempts to cover programming for the Internet.Thus, for covering MFC I give 5 stars, and 1 start for the other topics."
3,Doesn't live up to hype,"'The Industry Bible,' it tells you on the back cover. This book is a fine summary of the many things possible with VC, but is positively useless as a reference. A casual glance through the index might hint at a comprehensive reference, but turn to the referenced page and you'll find it won't tell you anything at all about what his code is doing. 'What does this function do? What does that function do?' The book is rife with decent examples but doesn't TEACH you ANYTHING. That is, try to do something that combines examples printed in the book and you shoot yourself in the foot, and the book is silent about what to do then. This book is miserable if you're just beginning to code for Windows (or using VC)."
2,You already have the book,I bought this book after reading the recommendations here. Has it escaped everyone that the book is included with the Visual C++ product? The examples are driven by wizards and do not teach you how to actually program with VC outside of what you already get with the software. Just print out the tutorials and save your money.
2,"I didn't pay for the book, but I regret buying the book.","I have some Visual C++ programming experience on Win NT. I just needed to brush up on my Windows programming because I haven't used VC++ for few years, so I bought this book because it SEEMED to cover many topics. As I was reading this book, I found myself totally lost because of very little explination in the book. It was not this difficult to learn VC++ when I first learned it, so I know that I am not the problem here.Even thought my company paid for the book, I regret getting this book. I'd return it if I still have the receipt.If you are not an VC++ expert, don't get this book. You are better off with reading online manual, which is what I ended up doing now."
4,Good solid presentation of use of MFC in VC++,"Title says it all, and for all the online refs and kindled books - sometimes you just need a good solid book to use.Hardcopy still has it's merits - not the least of which is bookmarking several locations and then easily flpping among them to solve a research point.Great book."
2,You had better know MFC already...,otherwise those sample codes just look like jumping out of nowhere. A better name for this book may be 'programming windows using MFC'. And indeed the authors are talented at this subject. They grab classes as their will but leave you dumbfounded. I bought it last week and I decide to put it on ebay auction tomorrow.
1,Barnyard,This was an absolute waste of money for me. The barnyard sounds were very distracting but the background was just OK. Dont buy this unless you like to metitate to or find soothing the sounds of roosters chickens and sheep with an occasional horse running by! My copy is for sale cheap!
1,I do not recommend this CD for meditation,I wish I had headed the warnings other's have posted for this CD below. But I fell for the low price. I thought that the background music was soothing... but the animal sounds ruined it for me. The birds and roosters are shrill and make meditation nearly impossible with this CD. I will not listen to this CD again.
3,it's like life,"i really like this CD because it's a case of meditation imitating life. there is the undertone of soothing, resonating, connecting, enlightening ""ohm"" with the great opportunity to focus while experiencing distractions. I can't think of a time the dog didn't bark, doorbell didn't ring, or the phone didn't jangle during my meditation practice - this cd allowed me to immediately reconnect, refocus - an excellent practice for... traffic?... long lines?... cancelled flights?..."
5,Been There ... Done That,"You will either hate this disk or you will love it. For my part I loved it. I've spent a lot of time trekking in Nepal. This is really what the place sounds like. Listening to the disk brought back memories of my treks. I felt that I was sitting in my hotel room in Katmandu listening to the sounds of the street below only in this case I had soft, meditative, music as an accompaniement. This is the music I wish I had had with me when I was trekking. If you are into ""sonic wallpaper"",the sort of smaltz that the big new age labels put out, this disk is not for you. It's to real, to gritty. If you want to capture the sounds and feelings of trekking through the Himalyas while soft meditative music plays in the background then this disk is for you. Listen to it, close your eyes and for a monent you can feel the cold wind of the Kumbu glacier swirl around you at Everest base camp."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I was really hoping that I would like this book. I just don't see why people consider Solzhenitsyn to be such a brilliant writer. This seemed to me to read like an unfinished work. The writing is o.k. but the characters are somewhat flat, the story is confusing and lacking direction and, at the end, it's like he started writing a different story that had little or nothing to do with the first. Like someone else already said: a well-done narrative history would be more informative, more interesting, and more entertaining. I definatly won't be moving on to the next book in the series.Not recommended."
4,Really Enjoyable Read,"Prior to reading this book, I had never read anything by and heard very little about Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The book lacked the tedium that I often find in rather lengthy books; for being 600 pages it was a page turner. The format was unique and the insight into the Russian front over the first days of the war was interesting. I would definitely suggest this book."
5,"I love this CD, it's the best Shania has done yet",The songs are the best. I can't stop listening to the songs on the CD. I recommend this CD to any fan who love dance and hear great music.
5,Shania's best CD yet,"This is Shania's best CD yet. My favorite song is ""From this moment on"" good going Shania."
2,Not worth the money,"If you're buying the record based on the catchy, ""Still The One"", you're going to be disappointed by the album. Formulaic and dull, the CD offers a LONG play time but you'll find yourself skipping through the songs quick enough to finish it in no time."
2,"Don't be Stupid, don't buy this cd.","Listening to this cd makes me long for the days that it took more that just a rockin' body and a descent voice to be called a musician. Shania Twain along with the Spice Girls are responsible for the downfall of radio. Every time I attempt to enjoy a local station I am constantly bombarded with the horrible garbage by musicians like Twain. If Shania could only improve on her lyrics I might actually respect her as an artist. Mrs. Twain has talent but she seems afraid to use it. Shania, stop surrendering to the restrictions of popular music and write something that is real."
2,Very Disappointed - Songs the equivalent of Wonder Bread,"I bought this CD after reading all the kick butt reviews by other owners of the CD, but I was VERY disappointed. I have to say, she was great on the VH-1 diva show but this CD is very over-produced and bland, without much guts or soul. I found the songs to be very formulaic and by the numbers, and even lyrically and musically quite shallow. I have to wonder if a lot of Shania's success is due to her great looks and sexy image. Let's face it, she has very slick packaging and looks great in tight clothing, but she's not the most talented singer/songwriter out there (albeit one of the prettiest ones). Although her voice does have some nice husky tones in it, her vocal range is extremely limited and it gets boring. I was expecting a little more soul and rock and roll from her - this CD has been stripped of all fiber - all that's left is Nashville white bread."
2,"Shania Twain is my favorite 'country' star, but.....","This disc is not good. Neither are her earlier offerings. I was depressed to find out that this version of the disc does not include the infectious pop remixes I hear on the radio, but rather the raw country versions which not only include the annoying, unnecessary twangs and plunks of banjos and harmonicas, but an overall poorer-quality, less satisfying production and slew of backing tracks. If you want the awesome, danceable pop mixes of her hits, get her Greatest Hits disc or better yet just go get Up!, her best album to date."
2,"""She Don't Impress Me Much""","I think this is a very over-rated artist getting by, for the most part, on her looks. Many of her songs are based on the same heavy beat, reminiscent of Queen's ""We Will Rock You"", so they sound the same. Also, her lyrics are usually silly & superficial (""Man! I Feel Like a Woman"", ""That Don't Impress Me Much"", ""Rock This Country""...). Her first CD (before she started writing her own material) was her best."
5,"Shania is ""Still The One! ""","Shania's newest album, Come On Over, has a great mix of pop and country in her album. Her voice is great, her faster songs are upbeat, and all of them have emotion running all through them! I love all of her music, especially ""Man! I Feel Like A Woman!"" The lyrics of that song are what a lot of women probably thing sometimes, and she puts emotion into it and makes it slightly humorous. Another song like that is ""Honey, I'm Home."" She is one of the few great singers!"
1,Sad,"It is quite sad that junk like this which has NOTHING to do with country music, gets played to death on country radio and has millions of people convinced they are listening to the genuine article. I would highly suggest that anyone and everyone who owns this album and thinks it is country to check out the real deal. Go discover artists like Iris DeMent, Heather Myles, and Kelly Willis and leave commercial tripe like this behind."
3,Corny... but I can't help but to like this album!!!,"It is true that Shania Twain is the most over-rated singer of the 90s. And it's true, if it wasn't for her husband we would have never heard of her. And it's true, she has greatly benefited from heavy promotion and her belly button. And it's true, SHE IS NOT A COUNTRY SINGER! However, I can't help but to like this album. Despite the fact its corny and cheesey, it's still funny. Let's hope when she returns from vacation, this almost 40-something new mother will have something to say and not write lyrics like she's still in high school."
1,Mixed messages...,"Practically all of Shania's songs talk about treating women with respect and women's rights - wonderful things, of course. But then she disgraces herself and every other woman by wearing practically nothing, letting her cleavage pop out, and wearing skirts short enough that nothing is left to the imagination. You want powerful women? Look at Faith Hill, Martina McBride, or Trisha Yearwood. Not only are their CD's incredibly well-written, but their videos are honorable too. Shania should put some clothes on and practice what she preaches. Only then will I have respect for her."
1,NO THANX,"I imported this CD from the USA back in November 1997, and I realy must say that I was VERY disapointed!! As a soundengineer I must critisize the bad soundquality,(digital highfrequencies) and as a musiclover I critisize all those cloned 16 ""hitsongs"" on one CD. 10 songs would be just enough this time. 6 songs should have been deleted from the harddrive right in the studio. Many songs lack from good chorus and genuine instruments. Do I hear samplers, voiceprocessors and clinical copies of drumbeats? Where are those acoustic Martins and violins and where did the magic go we found on ""The Woman In Me"". I'm sorry Shania got succesful in the rest of the world with this one. It's a shame they all think this is countrymusic... I lost track.....!"
1,How did society allow this to be passed off as music?,"This CD is not music, rather it is an all out offense to good taste. It would be no great tradgedy to see such vulgarity, and off-key noise publically burned. I really don't know what would possess all the brainless automotons who flock in droves to purchase the CD to actually listen to it. I mean everyone must have some sort of standards. I guess today's society is just more masochistic than I had realized."
3,"What's the difference, really?","I like Shania Twain. She's a gifted songwriter. She sells LOTS of records. I love the remix of THAT DON'T IMPRESS ME MUCH. However, I don't really see how, overall, different this so-called International Version is different. Maybe a few more listens. But I expected more."
1,"DON'T BE STUPID, SHANIA!!!","I don't even know where to start! I use to be a Shania Twain fan. I love her Woman in Me album! In fact it was her Woman in Me album that made me rush to buy this one. Well big mistake! She sings some of the most dummiest songs I've ever heard! ""Man I Feel like a Woman"", ""I'm Holding on to Love to Save My Life"", ""When"" and ""If You Wanna Touch Her Ask"" is a example of what I mean. She is far from being a talented song writter! She isn't as sexy as she thinks she is! She looks like someone that makes a her living off the streets! Well if you like songs that have very stupid lyrics, then this album is for you! I may have thought Shania was the best after The Woman in Me album, but I certainly don't think so now! I infact I now believe she gets WAY to much credit then what she deserves!"
1,Does NOT Deserve to Be Listened to.,"This is not music, and it should not be heard. Shania Twain claims to be a role model for young women, and i feel that is a disgrace to present herself in this way. She makes constant refences in this CD to women as being exclusively capable of ""going totally crazy"" and she says that wearing short skirts make her feel like a woman. she is proud to proclaim that she is not impressed by intelligence, rather she prefers a man who ""has the touch,"" or in other words can satisfy her physically. Her ""music"" certainly cannot be admired for its sound, it made my auditory neurons want to commit suicide. Even her slow songs, which i'm assuming were supposed to sound good, sounded like an underwater cow, I especially abhor the song ""From This Moment On."""
1,JELEK,"Gue belom pernah denger ini album, dan mungkin album ini jelek, kali ya...tapi sih penyanyinya bagus. jadi kurang lebih...lumayan lah..."
1,Not Even A Good Pop CD!(Let Alone Country),"Shania is a average songwriter at best and her vocal range is mediocre. I am surprised this album is so popular. I found myself skipping through most of the mindless songs. Finally, this is not a Country CD. This is pure pop music fluff ..... Patty Loveless, Faith Hill and Trisha Yearwood are all far superior female country music artist choices..."
2,Does good looks sell records? Yes I think so...,"Well, let's not deny the impact Shania Twain's looks have on record sales. Twain is absolutely one of the most beautiful women I've seen and she can also sing - that's good but not essential for success. ""Come on over"" is mainly country-pop of rather harmless character and songs like ""Man I feel like a woman"" and ""Don't be stupid"" is alright. The big hit ""That don't impress me much"", which by the way isn't sounding anything like country is a great song, but the rest of the material is very mediocre. I guess country music as a genre were in need of something to still be appealing, but I doubt this commercialization is the right way to go. To me it sounds a bit lifeless and without soul. I put my hope to the likes of Steve Earle and Jayhawks instead."
3,Get the American Version,"The production on this International version does not compare with the phenomenal work on the ""American"" version of ""Come On Over"". Not being a country-fan per-se, I thought the ""de-twanged"" cuts would be more to my liking. I was wrong. This version sounds less cohesive, less thought out (from a prduction stand point), with a lack of ""texture"", and in general, hacked-up. The slower balads still sound beautiful, and the techno-version of ""That Don't Impress Me Much"" is refreshing, but I wish I had checked out from the local library instead of putting down hard cash."
2,disappointed with International Version,I was expecting it to have a lot of International type music to it but it virtually sounded the same as the original. I think I may have mistaken this cd title for another of Shania's. Her music is great but I don't see a difference with the international version.
1,WHAT THE?,"Buy some Alicia Keys. Country stinks. Actually, this is not a country album. Shania is just a Spice Girl with a couple slide guitar solos thrown in."
1,"Shania can't sing at all, so why doesn't she stop!","At first, Shania was an ok artist, and her music was ok. This album is nothing but useless stuff. Stop trying to be Britney Spears too! They way she dresses and poses for pictures is really sad. Kids may look up to her, but probably their parents don't want them to, since Shania is a horrible influence! She doesn't even have a range to her voice! In all her songs she sings in the same octive, and shouldn't be allowed to sing at all. I wonder why she doesn't win many awards...maybe because first of all you need to be able to sing. She started as a country artist, so why can't she be one? Stop crossing over to pop! I say trash her!"
5,A classic!,"This is one of those rare gems that is truly excellent from start to finish, there isn't a single negative thing I can say about this album.Even after nearly a decade of being released this album never gets old, the songs sleep under your skin."
5,One of my favourites,I think this is a cool CD. All of the songs are good and I lsten to it often. I thnk her new song will hit #1.
2,very disappointing,"As a huge fan of ""The woman in me"", I was very disappointed by the simplistic lyrics on this CD. It seems to me that this was just thrown together in the hopes of capitalizing on her previous success. They would have done better by taking more time and writing some songs with substance."
5,Shania rocks this country!,"Shania Twain is the best female country artist.I am inspired by some of her songs like Man I feel like a Woman!, Come on Over, Honey I'm Home, and From This Moment On."
5,Country-pop at it's best.,"It's almost ridiculous to argue about whether or not Shania Twain is a country artist. Fact is, she's putting out some of the most cleverly crafted music in any genre. Credit her husband/producer Mutt Lange for the big pop hooks and Shania for the distinctively female perspective in the lyrics. Let the naysayers claim her appeal is all sex and no substance. The same was said about Madonna when she was putting out brilliant pop confections. Whether you like her or not, Shania knows what she's doing, and she's gonna be around for a long time to come, producing edgy, catchy music for the world's consumption."
5,SHANIA IS AWESOME!!,"This CD from Shania Twain is simply awesome!! I hated country music back in May, and now I LOVE it!! I can't wait until she comes to Lexington in concert on October 22, at least that's what I have heard on the radio! I am so excited. Anyway, the two best songs are You're Still the One and Honey! I'm Home!! They are great. If you like country..this CD is a must buy!!"
4,Very Good!,"Very Energetic! This is good ""pop"" music. This is NOT country music. However, Country or not, this cd is very good! The best cuts are: ""That Don't Impress Me Much"", ""Love Gets Me Everytime"" and ""Honey, I'm Home"". EVERY song could be #1! The lyrics and emotion are spectacular! This is a cd you must add to your collection. You'll be happy you did!"
4,Come on Over by Shania Twain,"Being a Rock & Roll music lover, I've very seldom found most forms of Country & Western music to be enjoyable. I will say however that Shania Twain has turned me around. Her music is a nice mixture of Country and Rock and is alot of fun to listen to. Garth Brooks was one of first to get me turned around but Shania is keeping me in that direction. Now I actually buy C&W like the group Little Texas, Faith Hill, LeeAnn Rhimes. Keep up the good work Shania and record more cuts similar to the ""Come On Over"" CD."
1,It gets old,"I have this CD and never play it any more. I find it hard to believe that there is anyone on the planet who hasn't heard these songs played continuously on the radio, so they are well aware of what they are buying. I believe part of her popularity is due to that fact her songs are so easy to sing people love to get up and do them on Kareoke night!!"
1,Save yourself some money,"I read the reviews on this board and decided the yays outweighed the nays so I went and bought it. After just one listening, I tried to give it away but nobody wanted it. So there it sits in its jewel case gathering dust. If you like Shania Twain because she's pretty, buy a poster. If you want good music, buy Martina McBride."
