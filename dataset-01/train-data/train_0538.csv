3,"Funny, but crass","Gave this to my dad for fathers day, and he told me it was a bit embarrasing. Some sexual stories, etc. He may be sensative, I haven't read it. Just be aware if you are giving it to a prude! (:"
5,Snort-milk-(or bourbon)-through-your-nose-funny,"I rarely laugh out loud during a book, but this one caused me to do so, many times over. My husband thought I was crazy (but now HE wants to read the book}. With two small kids of my own, I could completely relate with the author. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has kids in their life. Bitingly funny, sweet, loving and observant. I want more."
4,Manilow Magic Stikes Again!,"I really like this one, then again I like live performance anyway, but this one is really nice."
4,what a find!,"i picked this cd up unheard at a buy 2 get one free sale. it's releases like this that remind me that i need to take more chances with music. i loved it from the moment i put the cd on. her voice, lyrics, instrumentation...everything works so well together.having never heard of milla before this 'chance encounter', i am now trying to find other music she has done. maybe later i'll check out her films.light a candle and be absorbed."
2,It's eclectic and that's about it.,"Okay. It's not what you would expect out of a beautiful model. In the pantheon of actress/model/singers, Milla is by far the best singer/songwriter. But I swear to god, if she looked like baboon's behind, she would no bet able to get away with putting out such mediocrity. Most of the songs are boring, although I did like ""Ruby Lane"". And that Russian song was just gimmicky. Okay, so she speaks Russian. Surprise, she IS Russian. Again, if she was an ugly woman, nobody would be praising a Russian woman for singing in Russian.Her songs are getting better. The new one, ""Can you bend your back like this"" is pretty good. Let's hope the new CD is a lot better."
5,Such a beautiful spirit to exist in this world.,"It was five years ago that I was blessed to discover Milla's music. While flipping channels, I saw the last 10 seconds of an interview she was giving on Vh-1. Since I knew her from Return to the Blue Lagoon, I was amazed to discover she has a CD. I bought it that afternoon. I have not stopped listening to it since. As a matter of fact, I try to make others aware of her stunning talent. Working in a music store is the perfect opportunity for me to do just that. Just tonight I played The Divine Comedy in my store. Not 5 minutes after it had been playing, a woman asked who it was, and bought it immediatley. It is my pleasure to spread the word about Milla Jovovich, an artist who needs no comparison."
5,some Milla trivia,"I love this CD. It's certainly not perfect, but I want to point out that Milla wrote all of the songs on the CD when she was 15 YEARS OLD, and made the CD soon afterwards. Which enthralls me, but leaves me disappointed. Milla was a supermodel and actress at 11, then made her CD, and promised, in many interviews, that she would continue her musical career, and that she would NOT go back to modeling. Hence my disappointment. Hopefully she'll go back to music someday...."
4,Surprisingly good.,"I have to say that normally, I would not buy an album released by a model/actress as it is usually just a quick way for them to cash in on their success in other fields. But a friend had me listen to ""It's Your Life"" and ""Bang Your Head"" and I was hooked. Granted these are the best two tracks on the disc, but there are others that are good as well (""Gentlemen Who Fell"" and ""You Did It All Before"" come to mind). Equally surprising is the fact that Milla wrote all these songs herself (with the exception of final track ""In the Glade"" which is quite beautiful as well). She is truly a talent and I highly recommend this disc."
5,Doesn't get any better than this!,"This is by far the BEST sound I have heard in a long time. So maybe she does have a pretty face, maybe she IS beautiful, and perhaps that's why many people like her music. But she really does have a fabulous and enchanting voice/musical talent. I first saw her in the 5th Element and had to see more... but now I wish it was simply her music that drew me in, because it is so good. Despite that, This truly is a stunning creation filled with emotion and love. You will be wholely impressed. Buy it, Love it, Listen to it... it's timeless, it's a classic, it's the BEST...its MILLA!"
5,"Not only is it great, The Divine Comedy has staying power.","I have played this disc for 4 years and have never gotten tired of it. It is, as some say, more adolescent than some vocalists but the same could be said about Alison Krauss. What impresses me most is that I have liked almost each cut as my favorite at one time or another, the mark of a superior disc."
5,its all been said,"No body has really heard of Milla as a musician yet but i think this is because she copped a lot of [flak] simply because she is both an actress and model as well, and others who have crossed that line have suffered as a result of that. I truly believe once her bands album comes out this uear everybody will start to realise what a talented and hypnotic voice she has [none of my words can do it justice]. By the way her band is called Plastic Has Memoryand to that guy who left a review a little while ago, Milla DOES have a follow up CD= The Peopletree Sessionswhat else to say but BUY THE CD i dont see how anybody with a soul couldnt love it with everything they have seriously"
5,Awesome!,It's hard to expect good music from a movie star but this cd was absolutely awesome. I love it and fully intend on buying her second cd and any she makes afterward. I highly recommend this cd!
3,it could be worse,"Even though, from what I've read in the other reviews here, that it is not entirely the case that miss famous person got a big head and decided to release an album a la Will Shatner, but there are still evidences that this got put together 'for' her rather than by her. -- The session artists are unmistakable, (is that Paul Shaffer on oboe?) and the vocalizations, while seductive, sound more like mimicry than real expression. Call me an ogre, but she's no diva."
5,"""Divine"" describes it so well.","Her first album ""The Divine Comedy"" released in 1994, at age 18, is one of the most listenable CD's I have, and, out of several hundred discs, the only one I have two of. From end to end it is a touching look into Milla's younger years, every song written and performed by her. The songs were written when she was 15 to 17 years old, but this isn't bubble gum for the mind. The underlying rhythm of this folk-rock album is relaxing and sensual. And, unlike many of the super-models who've tried at music only to sound like bullfrogs croaking inside of a log, Milla has a beautiful, soothingly smooth voice. She's an incredibly talented artist with all kinds of future potential. This is a must have disc."
5,something special and unexpected,who would have thought beautiful milla can act and sing. She has a quirky and very beautiful voice reminded me of nelly furtado only 10 times better and not annoying at all. I definately reccomend this you wont be dissapointed.
5,"Translation of ""In A Glade""","In the forest near the Danube river, there is a nightingale singing, he sings to gather everyone from his family. In the forest near the Danube river, there is a bass vibrating and a fiddle crying, I think of a place where my lovely one is strolling now. In the forest near the Danube river, I am sick with my loneliness, crying, I want to fly like a bird, to where my lovely one is now. (Anonymous / Traditional Ukrainian Folk Song)"
5,Milla is truly a blessing on this earth...,"This multi-talented gyrl can make music, act, and model...Milla is so beautiful and so smart, their is nothing this girl cant do...Her debut album will definitlly take you places only your heart knows exist...and her next one coming up soon should be even better, but buy this in the meantime! u wont regret it at all...god bless!"
5,My Favorite CD of all Time,"I have to say that in all my years of buying music, I've never heard such a perfectly beautiful piece of work."
2,"Can't sing, and her songs are boring.","Sorry to say this, but I was disappointed with this album. Her vocals are amaturish at best -- they struck me as the kind of thing you'd hear at a Tuesday open-mike at the local cafe and think, hmmm, might sound good in a few years if she keeps it up. Her songwriting also shows her age, and are nothing special, either musically or lyrically. (Take a look at any teenage girl's poetry.) Best thing I can say about it is it's well-produced, if slightly derivative.I don't think this CD would have gotten pressed if it had been someone other than Milla.For contrast, consider Fiona Apple's debut. Fiona I would call a talented and creative vocalist, songwriter and musician; Milla is unfortunately just another (extremely) pretty face."
2,Don't quit your day job,"This cd was not at all good enough to compare to Tori Amos! OK!!! It's not bad, but it's not good either. A few of the songs were nice , but some just sounded bland. When you like someone in the spotlight, you tend to go along with everything they do and say ""hey that's great"" Well, not in this case. I've also heard her next album ""The People Tree Sessions"" Cool title. The album itself: let's just say that ""Divine Comedy"" is a whole lot better."
2,Really? People really like this?,"First of all, I love Milla. I generally enjoy her movies and she is a stunning actress, but this.... Well, yuck. The songs are poorly written, and the vocals are pretty iffy. The best song was the cover of an old folk tune. You can really tell she wrote some of this stuff when she was 15. I am amazed that people like it so much! The production quality is also really bad. (I have friends who make better albums in their closets.) I think that Milla has a pretty voice and is probably capable of making a great album, unfortunately this is not it."
3,Not exactly as stated,I believe my order said this was in GOOD condition. I received the CD which is just in FAIR condition as it is scuffed up a good amount and the case is cracked and the hinge of the jewel case was broken. The CD plays and the insert was there w/out any problems.
2,Divine Tragedy is more like it.,"Hey, hang on just a sec....I love Milla Jovovich. I love her OK, but this CD that I ordered, bought and paid for because of the magnificent reviews on Amazon just flat out sucks. It sucks, sorry Milla but you know it does too.I give MJ credit for her wide body of work and variety of talents, and on this disc she demonstrates that she can play several instruments, she writes the songs, and she performs them but not with much passion. I dont like this disc, and rather than let it collect dust I just threw the thing away. I didnt figure there was anybody I knew that would want it. Sorry. 2 Mooltipass to get me as far away from this sound as I can get."
3,This review may be horribly biased....,"...because I hate this kind of music, but my husband loves it. It's not painful to listen to. Sometimes. When I'm distracted by something else, like a root canal. And it makes me think of Blake's Visions of Hell, or Dante's Inferno.Okay, it really isn't that bad, for the genre. I guess."
4,A very pleasant surprise!,"Like so many, I found it difficult to believe a supermodel could create an album of any quality, but I was impressed with the track I heard on college radio and risked it. Wow! Milla turns out to have a lot of musical talent. The songs are rich, strange, and quirky, like Neil Gaiman stories set to music. Her voice is strong and clear, too. Even the cool, gothy cartoons on the liner notes are hers! I hope we hear more from her in the future."
4,Off the mainstream. A pleasure to listen to.,"I think I'm a rare case. I'd never seen Milla before, and the name meant nothing to me when I first heard this album in a cafe in Boston. By the end of the third song I was asking who the artist was. By the end of the album I had already run across the street to buy my own copy. It wasn't until I had seen 'Kuffs' that I realized she was already famous. It's easy to invoke all the key words: Folk, model, Kate Bush, Ukraine, etc... But I don't think any of those help much in understanding what this sounds like. Listen to the samples. If you don't think : ""Uh oh, weirdo music,"" then I'd suggest you buy the album."
3,Good Stuff But...,Well I bought it thinking it would have his bit (I think he was in New York???) when he was bombing really bad on stage and then stood strong and pulled out of it and turned it around and became one of the greatest performances ever. IMO. :) So if you want that bit you will have to watch it on YOU TUBE. All well. Still a fun CD anyway. :)
4,Entranced years ago...,"I first heard ""The Gentleman Who Fell"" on the radio years ago, and enjoyed it enough to buy it on tape, when I found that the whole album is just as lyrical and insightful, if not more so. I loaned the tape to a friend and it never returned--and I didn't think of it again until I saw the lineup for 5th Element, and realized it was her! I went out and bought the CD again (determined that this time, I wasn't going to loan it to anybody), and found the music to be a little less perfect than I had remembered, but still definitely worth the cost. I wish I knew what ""In A Glade"" was about..."
4,Purchased as a Gift,"My friend lives in France and loves Milla, but could not find the CD anywhere close to her. I purchased this for her as a gift and she really enjoyed it."
5,SIMPLY DIVINE,"I was ecstatic when I realized Milla Jovovich had a cd, and it sounded like the kind of music I like. I bought it immediately, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it since! It's absolutely gorgeous, and very original. I would suggest this CD to anyone who has a good taste in music. The highlights of the album are: Don't Fade Away, Clock, Charlie, The Alien Song, Did It all Before, Gentleman Who Fell, and of course the Russian folk song In a Glade. Just Do yourself a favor and buy this cd."
4,"Driving, mood-filled and catchy!","I bought this album because I heard clips of it online and was very intrigued that ""LeeLoo"" from one of my favorite movies, ""Fifth Element"", was a recording artist. I was not disappointed with my purchase. Not only does she present a medeival sound with modern twist, but it's catchy, relaxing, and the lyrics are thought provoking. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars: after too much continuous listening, her voice starts to irritate me. Solution: listen to something else for a while..."
5,LOVE IT!,"While I admit my musical taste goes from the classics to the downright weird, I have to say that I simply love this CD. I bought it on tape when it first came out, and then again on CD later on. I was totally shocked when I put two and two together to realize who the singer was - but I absolutely love this album and would recommend it to everyone!"
4,Bobsey Twins Books,"I wanted to read these because they were favorites from my childhood. And while they may not be ""pc"" they bring back memories of when I read them the first time."
5,The Bobbsey Twins - A family tradition,My mother ordered the collection of The Bobbsey Twins for me when I was a little girl. I would forward to the new book for the month. I enjoyed many hours of pure pleasure reading those books. My mother had read them when she was a little girl. I was ecstatic to find the series at Amazon.com. I have purchased them all so that I can share them with my niece. I wish I had found them when my sons were growing up. My mother mentioned the books at Christmas when we were talking about how my niece reads everything she can put her hands on. So I searched for the collection and found it at amazon.com.
2,"When it's not freezing, it's great",I have an HR20-700. If it weren't for the almost daily feeezes (necessary resets) this DVR would be fine. I'm please with the interface and quality of the video.But the freezes are killing me...enough to leave DirecTV after 6 years.
3,cannot use dvr in a room with any sun light,"I agree with majority of the review, I was lucky to get the hr20 700, even though I've had to reset it a few times its worked fairly well. The HD picture has been crisp. If you like directv tivo, you will HATE the directv dvr. It takes someone wih a techie mindset to navigate and record an ongoing show. For its price your wife will hate you for buying it.IF YOU HAVE A SUN LITE ROOM YOU WILL NOT be able to use this dvr. In my bedroom I get sun from morning until late afternoon. Even though there is no direct sunlight on the dvr, it will not see any signal from the remote. TV, dvd player and receiver works well but not the directv dvr. Everything returns to normal during dusk."
1,ACCESS CArd,NO ACCESS CARD. DIRECT TV WOULD NOT SUPPLY ME WITH ONE. blame direct tv not seller. I would not list dvr/receivers without access cards if i were amazon
4,Not as bad as most make it out to be,"I have owned Ultimate TV, TIVO, R15 and now the HR20. I will admit when I first got the HR20 back in October it did have a couple of issues. The HR20 has continued to improve as DirecTV releases new software patches. I have not had a lockup or a lost recording in over a month. I love the capability of being able to take full advantage of my Samsung HDTV with the addition of the HR20. I now have three HR20s and they all work as I wish 99.9% of the time. It is easy for critics to forget the lost recordings and lockups that Ultimate TV and TIVO use to have. I am completely satisfied with the HR20."
1,IT IS TIME TO TAKE A STAND (OR SHOULD I SAY THE TIME IS LONG OVER DUE),"IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE DIRECTV'S DVR UNIT IS WORTHLESS AND HAS MANY MALFUNCTIONING COMPONENTS AND SOFTWARE. IT IS ALSO OBVIOUS THAT THESE MALFUNCTIONING COMPONENTS AND SOFTWARE COULD BE RESOLVED WITH THE SAME TECHNOLOGY USED BY THE TiVo DVR UNITS. SO BASED ON THIS INFORMATION IT IS TIME WE TAKE A STAND; THERE ARE LEMON LAWS! IF DIRECTV IS UNWILLING TO EVEN TRY AND REMEDY THE DEFECTS THAT THERE PRODUCT HAS THEN THEY ARE NEGLEGENT OF THE LEMON LAW! SO IF NEED BE, MAYBE IT IS TIME FOR A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT."
1,I would actually give it NEGATIVE 5 STARS,"This is actually a beta testing unit, not a finished stable product. I have no clue how it got into production and our homes. Each update kept causing more and more issues until my wife was fearful of pressing any buttons on this unstable piece of hardware. The best thing is that it is a ""lease"" and DirecTV will not give you your money back. After discussing my issues with customer service they agreed to give me credit (over a span of one year) to basically cover my cost. I immediately replaced this junk with an older HR10-250. Buyer beware, I think DirecTV stock is going to suffer tremendously because of this snafu."
1,Constant crashes and other malfunctions,"I own 5 DirecTV TIVO DVRs and have been very happy with them, with only occasional problems. But as soon as I got this new HD DVR, I started having constant problems. The first one they delivered had a bad input, so the DirecTV technician installed a second. However, this one had messed up audio. Since he didn't have any others with him, we kept it for a week, experiencing intermittant audio problems, before finally getting DirecTV to bring a replacement. The third one appeared to work fine for a while until it started crashing. Sometimes, the audio would just go in and out, which is very annoying. I programmed my regular TIVO to record the same show at the same time and it sounded perfect, so I know the problem had nothing to do with the satellite signal. I really don't want to ask for a fourth unit out of fear it will be even worse and am now seriously considering moving all my business to Verizon FIOS TV."
1,Unit doesn't work as advertised,"I have had this product in Erie, PA for 4 months. The unit has a lot of issues with it. I bought it so I could record the OTA HD channels broadcasted in my area. The unit maps the avialable channels from a list it gets from direct tv. It doesn't look to see what is avialable like you think one would design a unit. Because direct tv has my channels mapped wrong for channel 35, I can't get anything. I have called six times, and they just say ""they are not responsible for keeping the list up to date"". Who is then? They sell the unit on specific features, but then don't support them.This unit does not live up to it's calling."
4,Chilling,"This might be the most realistic prison novel available in fiction. Highsmith captures what it means to have a life taken from someone for no reason and the lasting consequences of such an action. It is a disorienting, deeply disturbing book."
1,"There should be a ""No-star"" category","If you decide based on Highsmith's Ripley novel to read more of her, I encourage you to forget it.It appears she only had one or two books in her, and this one should have been left in the typewriter.There are few books that I can not get through no matter how badly written but The Glass Cell and the January book have been impossible.I hardly know where to begin, but to give you some idea, I threw ""The Glass Cell"", into the trash can last night, and this , thank heaven, my mind paid me off handsomely by --overnight--- emptying my memory, about the plot of the book, and all the things that made me toss it after struggling mightily thru a third of it.Save your time, money and frustration.Highsmith is finished as one of my go-to authors."
2,dated,"this book was ok but seemed dated in not a good wayi know it was written a while back but some books can still seem current but this one did notoverall though, the story is good"
4,"Best, cheap uncoated aspirin!","I use this in my aspirin mask and it works beautifully! Dissolved quickly because it has no enteric coat.My only problem is the lack of information on the product page. Firstly, the product I ordered looks like bottle in the first picture, the cylindrical bottle from ""GeriCare,"" and not that second photo of aspirin from ""QualiTabs."" Secondly, it doesn't state in the description it is uncoated, which I would've liked to have read explicitly rather than imply that it is.Other than that, great product. It's cheap, shipping is cheap, and it came really fast so MFASCO is a great seller."
4,Fun regency party,"Drusilla is companion to the Marchioness of Brentford. When the Marchioness's son comes home, he is determined to fire Drusilla. A house party soon brings the two together and Drusilla proves her worth. Pretty good characters and a pretty good romance. Drusilla was to harsh in the beginning and I didn't care for her, but grew to like her as the story continued."
3,Perfectly Satisfied,"I would simply like to say that the seller was totally okay and that I am satified with the end result. I would however NOTE that the product was not complete. The cymbals were not included with the book. I had no problem with the seller once this was made clear, but the description of the product has not been changed."
1,So unhappy,"I ordered this book almost 2 months before my class started in order to insure I was prepared for class. As of to day, 58 days later, I have yet to get my book in the mail. I have e-mailed the company with nothing but a auto-reply. I am now in my 3rd week of Biology with no book! So to sum up this review, very unhappy with the lack of product and the customer care that was provided."
2,This is the TPE bag...,"I purchased this bag direct from Lomo back in '07...it's a vinyl kind of bag, and started cracking badly after a few years. I'm buying the canvas to replace it.My Holga doesn't really fit in the camera portion. You can stuff it in, but the velcro won't keep the bag closed...so I'm thinking if i buy the canvas, then sew new velcro on, & we'll be in business.I looked all over for a messenger style bag like this with a camera portion that might be a better fit for a Holga and a Diana Mini, but no found nothing else.I suggest you go canvas, or splurge for the leather version."
3,"George Harrison, R.I.P., but not with This.","If you are a synthfool like me, then you might want to purchase this album. It is sound, and not music. Harrison was brave to put out this album when he did, but it is no longer revolutionary, nor, really, very listenable. I'm glad I bought it, purely from an historical outlook. I doubt if I'll give it more than few listens, though. Early Pink Floyd did more with sound as sound than this, and with less equipment."
2,too weird,"Label should read ""file under: acidhead freak noise"" What a weird record this is. kind of like lou reed's Metal Machine Music, another weirdo record. play this while on acid or to annoy you neighbors"
1,Uh.......................WHAT????,"I think it's safe to say that this is not George Harrison.Get on the ball, Amazon."
1,An Interesting Curiosity,"If you are about to begin a collection of the solo output of the Beatles, this is not the place to start. This album was originally released in 1969 on the Zapple label (a subsidiary of Apple, which only released two albums) as an experiment in sound. It is George Harrison tinkering on a Moog synthesizer for three quarters of an hour. It does get old. I have this in my collection only for the sake of having a complete collection, and for that, it is essential. Understand, however, that I have listened to the CD once (the same is true for my original vinyl copy). If you want everything Beatles or George Harrison, buy it. If you want to listen to George Harrison's music, start with the absolutely brilliant ALL THINGS MUST PASS."
3,wallbreaking sound,"Of course this is no masterpiece, and of course it lacks the very structured or meditative approach that makes electronic music interesting listening. All reviewers say Harrison played with a Moog, but the result is (acoustically) not very much different from electronic music of the fifties. He tries to make a soundscape that was radically different from his Beatles songs. At least George Harrison was very honest in his experiments (whereas Lennon was simply arrogant), and the cover makes it clear that he considered his music as a play. It makes an interesting journey in sound thought, and much more intuitive and organic than you would think at your first listen. If you don't like things like ""Gesang der Jünglinge"" by Stockhausen, you won't like this one, but if you do, you'll find a really surprising aspect of this multisided band that was the Beatles."
5,Excellent binoculars,"I bought these binoculars because they were the top rated ones on the moderate priced list by a very influential ornithology organization. You could spend a lot more to get the same quality binoculars in a smaller size, but you probably wouldn't get better quality binoculars. I just returned from a trip to Costa Rica where I used them constantly. I was amazed at how easy it was to see birds with these binoculars even in dark rain forest conditions."
4,hip-hop/funk2000,"cameo can still funk! this generation does not know what funk is, but cameo has brought the funk 2 the hip-hop scene mixing it with tight slick grooves and the snappy vocal harmonies that is there trademark. old school/new school, if you don't know what funk is,listen to cameo and you will be reminded of what is missing in music today, real musicians, and live instruments. if you dont know, you better find out. P.S. don't miss the live show. 2funky! peace!"
2,Very Average,The Cameo I Grew Up On did this Material as Filler Material not stuff that was their main Grooves.Sadly Cameo hasn't aged well here.I still Rock on The Old Jams but this isn't Happening.Very Average From Such a Great Group.
3,"If you REALLY LOVE Cameo, buy this CD!","This CD has all of the funk that Cameo is known for! Certain tracks include 'rap segments', and they're OK, but the music makes you move.The title track samples the bass line from 1986's 'Candy', and there are some other cool tracks.While this CD is a great effort by Cameo, it sounds 'dated' at times, and it would've been a GREAT followup to either 'Real Men Wear Black' or 'Machismo', both from the mid 80's & early 90's.Not bad, not bad at all! Owwwwww!"
5,bring on the funk with the new school flavor!,"CAMEO JAMS FROM THE OPENING SONG TO THE END. WITH THE RIGHT MIXTURE OF GOOD OLD FUNK,WITH A HIP HOP FLAVOR.AFTER TWO DECADES IN THE FACE OF FUNK. CAMEO PUTS OUT ON THIS ONE,SOME OF THE BEST RECORDING OF SONGS THAT THEY FUNKY MINDS CAN PRODUCE..."
2,A shadow of their former selves,"Though I always enjoy listening to the old school funk bands, this effort was very marginal and dated. Cameo no longer stretches the genre nor do they challenge the listener with new variations of funk. They have done little to evolve, and much of this CD sounds 'generic'."
4,One of the most popular daily papers in Vladivostok,"This paper is one of the most popular (if not the most popular one) in the Far-Eastern russian city of Vladivostok. I honestly don't know why anybody in the US would subscribe to this paper, especially considering the price -- $2,413.00 ($9.28/issue) in January 2012. In local kiosques it is less than a dollar or so. Besides, all the news are available online anyway on their website."
4,Song song song song song.....,"This album takes a while to grow on you, with alot of rainy day slow jams and sexual energy. But the flowin' vocals and genuine R&B beats keeps you pumpin'. I like the jams ""Got To Get It"", ""Addicted"", ""Incomplete"", ""So Sexual"", and ""You're Love Is Incredible"". Of course ""Thong Song"" is a classic, but there's more to hear from Sisquo, a great vocalist with alot of heart and talent."
4,One of the best debuts of 2000.,"Well, I guess I should say solo debut since he was with Dru Hill before, but still, this is good. I own Sisqo's first two solo albums and I definitely think that this one is better. It has arguably the greatest summer anthem of all-time in ""Thong Song"", a couple of great rap songs in the title track and ""You Are Everything"" feat Ja Rule, and some nice R&B songs in ""Incomplete"", ""Got to Get It"", and ""Enchantment Passing Through"" feat Dru Hill. I think that one of the big reasons that adults are put off by this album is simply the lyrics in ""Thong Song"". If you sit and listen to the rest of the album though, he only has a couple of other tracks where he says anything even remotely bad. I think that one of the other reasons that I like this album so much is because since he made this, Sisqo has sort of sold out. When this came out though, he wasn't as big as he is now yet, so the songs were more original."
5,The best R&B solo album ever!,"This CD is great! I absolutely LOVE the Thong Song, Unleash The Dragon, and Got To Get It, but all the other tracks are amazing! Buy this CD as soon as you can and you will find that it is one of the best CD's yet! Unlike DMX, he doesn't growl or bark before every song, unlike Will Smith, his songs are catchy and fun to sing, and unlike Eminem, his songs don't offend you until you want to puke(I'm a big fan of Eminem, though). So buy this CD and you'll find yourself singing these songs for days! ""She was wearing a dress that was so scandalous, she was shaking her butt like who's the ish, had a wink in her eye that was so devilish, 'cause she was livin' la vida loca..........."
3,Not what it seemed to be,"When Sisqo came out with ""Got To Get It"" I thought the CD was good. When ""Your Love Is Incredible"" was played on the radio I thought ""its tight"". When the ""Thong Song"" came out I just KNEW it was THE BOMB DIGITY. But when I herd the CD it wasn't what it seemed to be. Sisqo sounds better leading in Dru Hill. When they all get together they soung AMAZING. But Sisqo singing lead and background starts getting to you. He still can sing but when I heard ""Enchantment Passing Through"" and ""You Are Everything""(Remix)the sound that was missing through out the rest of the CD was suddenly there. Don't get me wrong this CD still has good songs such as ""Unleash The Dragon"", ""Got To Get It"", ""Your Love Is Incredible""(which he sounds good alone in), ""So Sexual"", ""Thong Song"", ""Enchantment Passing Through"", and ""You Are Everything""(Remix). But just think about what ""Got To Get It"" would sound like with Dru Hill singing background.I MUST SAY I LIKE DRU HILL ALOT BETTER!"
4,a new Jodeci,"Sisqo's 1st solo effort has been a long time in the works. When R&B soul crooners Jodeci disbanded it was Dru Hill that picked up the void left behind. In sound, lyrical content and image they haven't missed a beat, but Sisqo's solo has pushed into new undiscovered territory and all I can say is, This sounds like another R&B/Hip-Hop success story. Can anyone say Fugees, Lauren Hill? And he is that good."
2,so-so,"The lyrics were very plane. There was no creativity in this album. It was just about sex, wich is alright but this was to much. Maybe when he matures a little more he will write quality music. As for now this is strictly for the ""teen""y boppers."
2,can't stand alone,This solo effort from Sisqo is missing the those elements to make it great. He has the voice but no foloow threw or any meaningful songs.
3,Lyrically Tame,I love the CD and I love sisqo. I will say I was a bit disappointed in some of the songs because I don't think he (sisqo) used the full range of his writing skills. On a couple of the songs (got to get it and Thong song) he limits himself to 2 lines and a hook.We know the brotha can sang I want to see him WOW me with some fantastic lyrics
4,Sisqo is definetly letting the dragon out!,"This album is one of the best I have right now. It does have it's few drawbacks like many albums, but nevertheless it is still good. It has plenty of smooth ballads like Incomplete and Is Love Enough and a few dance tracks like The Thong Song and Unleash The Dragon. My favorite tracks on the album is Incomplete and Unleash The Dragon, but basically all of them are good, so I suggest you get this album if you were planning on it."
5,One Of the Best Albums to Date~!,"Sisqo's foremost album, Unleash the Dragon, can only be proclaimed as one of the best mixes of R&B and Hip-Hop to this day. After purchasing the CD, I soon found myself bouncing to the beats of ""I got to get it"" and ""Unleash the Dragon"" and then jumpin' and jivin' to ""The Thong Song."" My favorites are the cool relaxed songs like ""Your love is Incredible"" and ""Addicted."" But for those special times you gotta play ""incomplete"" which is an incredibly smooth love song. Every track has its own unique style that will keep you singing along to the entire CD. So if your a big fan of the DRU WORLD ORDER, you gotta pick up this album."
3,"Some good songs,too many love songs","I had heard sisqo's ""Got to get it"",and ""thong song"" before and thought that the album would sound like those two songs.Im giving it three for its three good songs ""Got to Get it"",""thong song"",and the only song off of the album that wasnt a hit""unleash the dragon"".The rest of them are boring love songs.I wouldnt run out and get it now,i could have just bought the singles and saved money."
1,same old cliche r-n-b of now,"this album could be anybody singing on.who in current r-n-b except for d'angelo,lauyrn hill,maxwell,angie stone,meshellnedeocello,mint condition,eric benet doesn't already sound like this? it was bad enough that sisqo was biting jodeci when he is doing the dru hill albums but everything else as well? avoid at all costs.very cliched r-n-b of now.it's so sad."
2,Only Two Good Songs,"What is that old saying? ""Fool me once, but never fool me twice"". After being tricked into buying this cd because of the songs ""Thong Song"" and ""Incomplete"", I did not purchase Sisqo's last cd (millions of other people didn't neither). Why? Because there are only TWO good songs on this cd. Sisqo is over-rated. I mean, he has some style but its clear that he is not as talented as I thought he was. What Sisqo needs to do his leash his dragon and his group Dru Hill because they have nothing to offer but one or two good songs."
2,This is supposed to be rap? This is R&B!,"This is bad quality R&B indeed! i bought this album because I thought it would be rap [well some of it is]. There are like, three songs on here that are DECENT.1. the thong song2. got to get it3. Unleash the dragonthose are somewhat decent. I had no idea this album was all slow and stuff. this album is a MUST NOT have! Sisqo shows no talent in his songs. I bet he didn't even write them. that's my guess. It doesnt mean its true.Anyway, this is definately NOT worth your money. it cant get any worse than this.Although, if you're a big fan of R&B, then you will like this album alot! If you're a rap fan and expecting rap, DON'T BUY THIS!"
3,AM I RIGHT?,"I think some of the tunes on this are so phat like ""thong song"", ""gotta get it"" and ""unleash da dragon"", but it's like the rest of 'em are just real soppy...the kind of songs you play at nite if u gets me. What do you think? I mean I think sisco's da bomb, but he killed it yo!"
5,The Best Of The Millenium,My comments concerning this specific artist is really nothing to get so unexcited about. Sisqo is very talented with his work. Sisqo gives us something unexpected out of him. I personally think that whoever bought his album got their money worth.
1,ONE OF THE WORSTS ALBUMS I EVER HEARD!,"I have no words to describe such ""album"" and I'm not going to waste my time doing it. If you like POP like Destiny's Child or cheap rap like NAS or Puffy Daddy...THIS IS YOUR ALBUM!! Let's get serious here,...DON'T FAKE THE FUNK!"
4,Wow!,"Hey, I bought the EDITED VERSION of UNLEASH THE DRAGON and thought it was a great CD. Let's see...the TITLE TRACK is good and so is GOT TO GET IT, which in my opinion is the best song on the CD. You've got THE THONG SONG and YOU ARE EVERYTHING with Ja Rule and Nokio. The beats are good, but aren't great. There aren't to many blanks on it like on the DMX album, IT'S DARK AND HELL IS HOT. It much better too. If it were between SISQO and DMX, SISQO rules out. He can sing and keep coming up with hits!"
4,Sisqo unleashing the DRAGON,One of the best albums currently out. The thong song makes the album worth buying. Sisqo is a hell of a singer and great performer.
5,The CD Is Off The Hook!,"Sisqo combines hip-hop, R&B, and soul altogether and makes a hype record. I especially loved the ""Thong Song"", where he raps and sings. Since he is a very handsome and intelligent young male he is going to go very far in the music industry."
3,Thong Wrong,"I think Sisqo is a very talented individual with great vocal skills. However, I think he's selling his talent short by writing lyrics that are desined to attact a younger listner. If you look at KC and JoJo their most recent album had cross over appeall which allowed them to make more money and respectability."
5,Great CD!,"This CD is da bomb. The best songs are Unleash the Dragon, Got to Get It, Is Love Enough, Thong Song, and You Are Everything (remix). Trust me. Just buy it. Good work Sisqo!"
2,Dragon....not as fierce as it's fire,"Well the first solo album from sisqo...is not one word nasty. The cuts from the album exude nothig but sex. Yeah he can holla and yell with the best of them but where is the artist. It seems as though he is using sex to sell his album which does not for me make the artist. Take my advice buy ""Back At One"" Instead"
1,Horrible,"I can't believe all of these great reviews are from REAL people. Listen, I'm a die-hard Jodeci fan and I like Sisqo too - even though he ripped my boy K-Ci's style. But this latest joint ""Unleash the whatever"" is a joke. The songs have NO substance, the beats are played out and boring, Sisqo's still doing the same vocal runs that K-Ci played out YEARS AGO, and.... I could go on and on. This is a CLASSIC bubble-gum pop album with essentially no ROOTS and I would not recommend it to anyone who has any type of appreciation for music.With artists such as Erykah Badu, Maxwell, Lauryn Hill, Macy Gray, and D'Angelo delivering fresh, rootsy, art-driven SOUL FOOD for our brains, I can't find one single reason to support ""Ride-the-pony"" pop crooners like Sisqo and Ginuwine who can't find anything else to say other than, ""I want my love deep inside of you tonight girl"" on every other cut.Do yourself a favor and buy something thought-provoking and meaningful. This is JUNK."
4,Not Quite I Expect...,Sisqo's album Unleash The Dragon for me was something that I wasn't expecting really but overall his talent is wonderful and so is his album but there are some songs that I didn't really like. However he's still good though... wonderful music. He still retains his unique style of singing from Dru Hill and I admire him for that. But he didn't change his music so that was good. I guess now his music is a great hit he's going to become successful for sure. He has talent and his music is great what more can we ask of Sisqo... Keep the music going and this music love it or hate is still Unleash The Dragon no matter what ever happens
4,Unleash Sisqo,"You have to admit, Sisqo's album is tight. I didn't think I was going to like, but it did. My favorite is out of ""Got To Get It"" and ""Is Love Enough."" In a way I should have known that it was a great album because he is a great performer and the real star of Dru Hill. I think they schould just break up, if they already haven't because from the moment you first saw them, Sisqo stood out. He's probaly the only one people know by heart."
5,Unleash The Talent!,"This cd is definatley worth buying and is rated more than just five stars to me. The songs are really good on it and there's not one song that you would want to skip.SisQo is one of a kind with his unique, fresh, and catchy beats which is why this cd is a must to have!"
2,WOOOOHAAAA! This is Penile.,"Sisqo announced to the world a few weeks ago that the Dragon of title of is His Penis, and He is The Dragon. Consequently, one can deduce that he rates his Penis rather highly. This, I have heard, should not be the case. If this album is anything to go by, not only must he have trouble pleasuring The Ladies on a regular basis, but he probably has trouble urinating in front of other men as well. We're talking tiny, and flaccid. The album, that is. Read into that what you will. It's mediocre RNB, with a little bit of guitar, and some quasi- Wu Tang posturing involved, as well as a nice line in Natty White Threads. It's also not very good. Nevermind, eh? Next time you can name it after your buttocks, which I've heard, are quite pert and well - rounded."
3,This review is incomplete....,..cos i have only heard 3 songs off the C.D. I must say that thong song is one of the coolest songs i have ever heard! Got to get it is pretty fantastic too. Addicted is a love song and is a bit dry but it does show Sisqo's talent. I really am a big fan of Dru Hill and shall be getting this album shortly!
4,I remember this.....,"I remember when this album first dropped on the earth. I was proper on it! The tunes I liked were ""Got To Get It"", ""Thong Song"" (which the whole earth was bouncin to during that summer!)""Incomplete"" (the classic slow jam...i knew every word), ""Is Love Enough"" (that was my BIG TUNE!), ""Your Love Is Incredible"" and ""Everything"". This album has good memories for me...Sisqo did well on this album. But his second album was rubbbish, there was only one tune i liked (can't even remember what it's called) but after a while that jarred me too....on the whole good album but I think Sisqo's solo days are done......"
3,At least it was better than 'Return of Dragon'...,"This CD was okay. I don't know, it was mediocre to me. But it was better than his sophomore effort, 'Return of Dragon'. I've never been too much of a Sisqo fan...I mean, his vocals are loud and strong, but he just doesn't have a good voice to me. He should have just stuck to Dru Hill because his albums are weak..."
4,UNLEASH THE DRAGON!,"IM UNSURE Y SISQO CAREER WENT FLOP AFTER THIS C.D. CAME OUT. IT WAS PROBALY THE FACT THAT THE WORLD GOT TIRED OF THE ""THONG SONG"". BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS A GREAT C.D. WITH SONGS ABOUT LOVE , SEX , RELATIONSHIPS AND OF COURSE THONGS, SISQO SINGS HIS HEART OUT. YOU AND FEEL WERE HES COMING FROM ON ALL THE SONGS AND HIS VOICE IS JUST GREAT. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A OLD C.D. WITH A GREAT SINGER I WOULD RECOMMENED U GET THIS C.D. AND LET SISQO UNLEASH THE DRAGON ON U. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
2,"Good for radio, good to burn, not good to buy","Its an ok album, but it not really an album you would put in your greatest of all time collection. It has one or two good songs, i can even say its three, and the writings as well as the beats are tight, but its not really something you would bring to the table except the fact that the radio played out one of the worst songs on the album, ""Thong Song"""
4,Sisqo Has A Winner,"Unleash the Dragon is a very uptempo cd. It has a little of something for everyone. The Thong Song and the Got to Get It are obvious favorites. However, Sisqo remembers to slow his cd down with songs like Incomplete. Some of the songs on the cd have to much profanity and he does use the ""n"" word but Sisqo can be forgiven since this is his first solo effort."
5,SISQO HAS DONE IT AGAIN,"NO DOUBT SISQO HAS DONE IT AGIAN. UNLEASH THE DRAG CD IS OFF THE HOOK. NO DOUBT SISQOS THE BOMB BABY. HE DID IT W/DRU HILL NOW HE'S OUT ON HIS OWN, CONTROLING THE CHARTS. THE ENTIRE CD IS SMOKEN BUT THIS BEST ONE I LIKE IS THE ""THE THONG SONG"". NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE VIDEO WAS SHOT HERE IN MY HOME TOWN ""MIAMI"", BUT B-CUZ HE DID THINK ABOUT THE OTHER CATS OF DRU HILL AND HAD THEM IN THE VIDEO ALSO. BUT OVER ALL I GIVE SISQO HIS PROPS AND IM LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME UP COMMING HITS. ""MORE POWER TO 'YA SISQO, KEEP ON KEEPING ON."
5,Sisqo could not be any better...,"I LOVE SISQO!!!!!! he is a HOT, very talented singer who's amazing voice and great songs keep you entertained through the whole cd. i like every song from ""Unleash the Dragon"" (which is awesome if ur in the mood to dance) to ""Incomplete"" (which is more on the slow/sensitive side). some of my favorites are ""Your love is increadible"" and ""You are Everything"" which is performed by dru hill. all in all as long as your a fan of r&b you can't go wrong with this great cd!"
3,Not great,"When I first heard Thong Song I thought this Cd was gonna be great but it wasnt. This Cd has to many love songs not enough Rap. The only good songs on it are Got to get it,Unleash the Dragon,and Thong Song."
5,sisqo rocks1,"this cd is the best all the songs are good, it even has a new song by dru hill two D. hill songs in total. all songs are good incomplete is wicked"
2,I give him credit for songwriting and for success,"Okay, everyone, I've changed my mind: I was only hit by Sisqo because of that Thong song piece of s**t. Yeah, the song is catchy but little more I like out of him. I give him credit because he co-writes his songs and for the success he got with this. Otherwise, he's not for me."
2,A piece of crap,"I'm afraid that Sisqo is one of the worst singers of all time. The only good song he has is ""The Thong Song"", which gives this CD two stars. I was going to buy it, but after listening to some of his songs on the radio, I found Sisqo really sucks. The only good songs he sang was the one with DMX and ""The Thong Song"". Otherwise, Sisqo really needs to work on being a better rapper/singer, or else he will plunge down the charts like Marilyn Manson."
1,Why Did U Break Up Dru Hill?,"Sisqo's album really bugs me. How can everyone think it is good? Only Thong Song is worthy of listening. Sisqo is not exceptionally talented, and his voice is just plain irritating. Dru Hill was a great group, and it is sad that Sisqo went on his own instead of sticking with them."
3,A Successful Solo Effort That Fueled A Craze For Thong Underwear (Thank You)!,"Sisqo's solo debut entitled ""Unleash The Dragon"" was released on November 30, 1999. Though album sales sold moderately at first, as songs such as the infectious ""Thong Song"" and the melodic ""Incomplete"" rose up the charts, ""Unleash The Dragon"" exploded in popularity and ultimately fueled a craze for thong underwear! This album contains more than just a popular spring break anthem, however, there are a few songs that could be considered ""fillers."" Below, please find the rating for each song individually:Unleash The Dragon (Featuring Beanie Sigel) - 10/10Got To Get It (Featuring Make It Hot) - 10/10Is Love Enough (Featuring Lovher) - 7/10How Can I Love U 2nite - 6/10Your Love Is Incredible - 7/10So Sexual - 6/10Thong Song - 10/10Incomplete - 8/10Addicted - 6/10Enchantment Passing Through (Featuring Dru Hill) - 6/10You Are Everything (Featuring Dru Hill & Ja Rule) (Remix) - 10/10"
3,so-so compilation,"Where are songs like: Fresh is the Word, Join Me Please...,In Full Effect, This Should Move Ya, Stone Cold Roach, etc??? At least it has Needle to the Groove, Get Stupid Fresh Pt 1, Who Is It?, Simple Simon, and the awesome HARDCORE HIP HOP!!! A decent collection maybe, but hardly definitive or ""best of""."
4,Well Written Period Erotica,"This is a well written bit of erotica involving the unfortunate happenings of a young women around the beginning of the Civil War, winding up as a mistress to a slaveowner. The book concerns her telling her story to a visitor after the events have taken place. The plot near the end basically tampers off but before then there is some enjoyable set pieces and enough creativity so that it is not simply a bunch of sex. I like that sort of thing, others might not. It was written anonymously in the late 1800s, as I recall, but the writing style is fairly contemporary. A few touches give it an old time flavor (such as the use of ""the spot"") but in a good way. Recommended."
3,CAUTION - Has sharp pieces that may cause injury,"We love the convenience of this pack n play and can't imagine traveling without one but a recent incident has compelled me to write a word of caution to all parents. My son recently began walking -- a bit wobbly at first of course with lots of ups and downs. On one of his ""downs"" he fell against the leg of the pack n play and received a 1-inch gash across his cheek (which is now a scar). I had never really looked very closely at the legs of the pack n play until then and noticed that there is a plastic square ""nut"" with sharp edges for the screw that attaches the cloth sides of the pack n play to the frame. This assembly is true of most (if not all) of the Graco pack n plays. We have since taped foam cushioning around each leg to prevent future accidents."
4,wonderful addition,"We bought this for our third child. We had a graco pack and play for our first child and it lasted through our second, which was about nine years. I looked at many different play yards and decided on this one because of all the things it offered and the price. My son is only a month old, so we have just used the changing area and the bassenet, but i love both."
4,"Simple, affordable and set up is a breeze!!!","I have this playard but in a different print. I love it. It sets up in less than a minute. The full size bassinet is roomy with soft padded sides for your baby's comfort. The mobile is simple, but cute and is musical. I use the music/light attachment as well to lull my daughter to sleep. The light is nice in the middle of the night to check on her without disturbing her. There are so many playards on the market today with so many attachments and features, but since most of them are in relation to the bassinet portion or changing table, it is not worth the extra money for such limited use. Graco makes the best playards on the market. They are the easiest to set up and fold up compact. If you are looking for a simple model this is the one for you."
1,Not what i was hoping for,"The rug does not look anything like in the picture. The color is much darker, looks almost dirty. It is very thin and you don't get the sisal look the picture is promising. I am very disappointed and return it."
3,Excellent Heater...but is a electriciy user,"Used the device all winter last year. Added about $50 a month to our electric bill inspite of its themostat regulator. Did the job though, no ice! We intend to use a smaller 250 Watt device this year."
1,dont use this type of in tank heater.,This type is difficult to install and the flange often does not work and then you have a heater but no way to install.
1,Don't buy this product,"I have used this type of product for many years, never this brand. This one has doubled my electric bill and keeps the water at > 40F. It is not low profiled as advertised, and stays on much of the time, even when the temperature is >45F I contacted the company and they were very uncooperative. I would highly discourage anyone from purchasing this product."
2,"does not fit ""universally"" in the rubber flat back bucket","I bought this as a replacement for the Farm Innovators Rubber Flat Back 5 gallon bucket. This element does not fit in the bucket, it is too long. I have bought replacement elements in the past that fit just fine...but this one is made differently. The black part on the element is usually made so it slides through the bucket and just the element is left in the bucket. With this unit, the black part does not fit through the hole in the bucket, increasing the length of the element by nearly 2 inches which does not fit in the bottom of this bucket. It might be fine for a 50 or 100 gal stock tank, but it was advertised and sold as a 'universal' replacement for the 5 gal bucket. Very disappointed."
4,TRACK LISTING & RECORDING INFORMATION,"1. Move Mountains2. What's Going On3. Barry D. Next To Cleanliness4. Broken Bones5. Song 13Recorded live by WXRT radio, Chicago. SBK Records, 1990"
5,so bright it could blind you,"I have been playing with making shapes out of lights to amuse myself. I wanted a different color so I bought the green laser. The light is amazingly bright, so much that the beam is visible in the dark. This model has a great feel and weight to it. It appears to be made of quality metal with a brushed aluminum finish. It's about the size of a pen and the switch is located in a spot that I find easy to use. The box it comes in is sturdy. It's easy to put in the batteries. I am quite satisfied with this purchase."
4,A piece of American Naturalism,Garland is an expert at capturing local color. This collection of short stories shows the brutal reality of farm and rural life in the Midwest. His characters are thrown around in the cruel world and have no real way of escaping. His women characters are strong and hold their own in world dominated by hard working men. This book shows how it was like to live in the West one hundred years ago.
4,"Great vision, but overwhelming","As others have said, this shows some of the ways the church is going to have to move to fit into the 21st Century. However, such an extensive use of technology (and its cost) is a bit overwhelming for many."
5,Fantastic Starter Soup Book,"I come from a long line of cooks in my family. My grandfather was trained during WW2 by a french 4-star chef and he taught my father who sorta taught me, or at very least ignited my own personal passion for cooking. Needless to say, I have much to learn in the kitchen and my skills are...basic at best. However, I know what tastes good. This book has changed everything for me. I have made almost every recipe in it and it has added much to my skill level. I may not need help cutting vegetables, but making stocks was very helpful, as was a roux, etc. You will NOT be disappointed in this book if you think any canned soup available on the market today is....well, any good."
4,Master Mack,"In my humble opinion, the soprano's voice sounds a little bit forced but, by all means, buy this CD if only for oboist John Mack's fluid grace and warm, wonderful sound. The fact is he does much more that accompany the singer: he comes across as a full and equal participant, most especially in the Baroque pieces. The strange thing about this CD is that the first half is Baroque and the second more modern, including Blake songs, etc. Personally, I prefer the Baroque part; I guess it's really a matter of taste, though I feel the two halves don't mesh together all that well. The pianist/harpsichordist too is excellent, as is the quality of the recording but, for me, Mr. Mack's masterful playing is the best ingredient of all."
5,Another Home Run for Kemp,"A satisfying conclusion to the Erevis Cale Trilogy, while still leaving you thirsting for further adventures.Fast paced and exciting, Midnight's Mask wonderfully closes out the trilogy. It exposes the reader to incredible magical feats but remains a character driven story. The two champions of Mask are further developed and solidified as two of the most interesting characters in the Realms. Characters from the previous books are further explored while new interesting characters are revealed as their parts in the story play out.The two main points that I enjoyed from the previous books are still present in the third. The dark nature of the story makes it all the more real, while the depth of the characters makes you feel you know them. This book, like Twilight Falling and Dawn of Mask, is well worth the read. Give me more!"
5,Really Excellent Sci-Fi,I read this in 1991 and it totally blew my mind - one of the best sci-fi books I've ever read - I highly recommend it to the creative/imaginative reader.
3,"Great ideas and science, but flat characters.","Pohl presents a novel type of alien life that's still accessible and understandable. He also gives us a couple of human characters whose journey's to another planet crosses paths with the alien. The interesting twist is that neither the humans nor the aliens no that they other exists, and yet the alien's actions have a large effect on the main characters.The hard science is excellent. Not much hand-waving Star Trek science here -- just the real thing based on the current scientific mainstream with only a few reasonable extrapolations. The story presents cryogenics, stellar evolution, and even some quantum mechanics. Pohl's style is accessible while still being accurate.But the main point of the book is not the science, but the characters. Unfortunately they are the weakest part of the book. Somehow I never found myself really caring about any of them. They certainly live through interesting times, but they are rather flat and predictable."
4,It's so good to be bad!,"Kim Corum's Playtime is one of the steamiest erotic novels ever written. The novel about a woman's quest to shatter all sexual inhibitions satisfied me from beginning to end - so to speak. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to act on every deviant and taboo sexual desire then this is the book for you. Corum does an excellent job chronicling the life of the proverbial bad girl. Even though it doesn't exceed Corum's Breaking the Girl, Playtime is insatiable erotica nevertheless. Highly recommended to all erotic fiction enthusiasts..."
5,"Yeah, baby!","Playtime is about a couple who go for a non-traditional realationship, i.e. an open realtionship. I had never read about something like this in a novel before but have to say, I would like to read more. It was very entertaining and insightful."
1,What a disappointment!,"I thought this book was poorly written and the sex 'per se' was laughable, not even a worthy beach novel. I didn't finish it because it was too outragious!"
1,Hated this book,I bought this based on other reviews and I must have gotten a different book. This was disjointed and made no sense. My best friend and I trade books and I would not even show it to her. I just didn't like it.
3,"A fun read, but completely inaccurate historically","I won't go into all the inaccuracies here. Very fun to read, but please follow it up with the real story via Alison Weir or another reputable historian."
1,Junk Electronic gizmo,"This is pretty much the epitome of cheap foreign made electronics, crappy display that was difficult to read, not intuitive, and then died rapidly. Bought new and kept in original box unused, was going to give as a gift only to find out too late it was non-functional. Will never buy another product from this company, and really regret bucks blown on this junkie chess game."
3,ORIGINAL DEATH METAL,"This is original death metal with keyboards all along the songs. I am not crazy about this band but this is a different work, recommended for death metal collectors."
5,I am in awe of it!,"Among my six b minor mass recordings are Gardiner's and Klemperer's, so I am not easily impressed when I encounter a recording new to me. I purchased this set on the basis of Rilling's reputation as a Bach scholar and on the strength of several of his cantata sets. After the first hearing, I moved it to the top of my collection. Now, after several more times listening to it, I am in awe of Rilling's accomplishment. His soloists and choir are top drawer, his orchestral support even more so. The brass section especially plays with a gusto and clarity that is unmatched anywhere. Rilling has achieved a grandeur that is clearer than Klemperer and a fuller, more reverential, sound than Gardiner. Although all three are five star recordings, even in, as noted in a prior review, Amazon's vastly inflated ratings, I now find that i am going to Rilling's set for both enjoyment and study. I recommend it with great enthusiasm."
2,Disappointed,Color faded dramatically and stained the inside or my dryer blue. It finally came off after about 3 weeks. Sheets are stiff too
4,I love the energon series,"This is the last cd in the energon series, i know there are some more episode to conclude the series but I can't seem to find them which is very disappointing to me.I am a geek that knew only the G1 series (loved is of course) and now as a 40 years old geek watching it with my 2 little boy who are enamored with the transformers.The energon episodes offering good plot and animation even though some episodes are missing - don't get it - but overall good - recommended.I just wish they will produce the last energon which offer the demise of megatron."
5,"awesome, now where's the box set?",These are great Transformers toons. Now we need the whole series in a set please.
3,An ok tape.,"It deals with the history of the robot, computer and other machines in both Sci-fi and our imagination. It shows how the Sci-Fi ideas changed what was going on in science and how real steps in science changed Sci-fi ideas. Interviews with some of the authors are enjoyable and the clips from many TV series and big screen movies are nice, but it is not anything new. In other words, if you are a sci-fi fan you would know most of what they show and they don't really generate anything AMAZING or BRILLIANT. Think of it as Machines in Sci-Fi:101."
5,You can't have mine,"I purchased a new box of this set many years ago and am amazed to see what it's fetching (up to $2500). The fact of the matter is that it is quite worth it. It is 18 discs of solid, classic, archival jazz from the immortal Nat King Cole."
5,The Best,"Certainly one of the best music films ever made with the incomparable central figure of D. Boon and his best friend, bandmate and bassist Mike Watt, and incredible drummer George Hurley. It does justice to these guys and that's saying A LOT. It's also a great glimpse into unadorned punk history."
5,"""Econo"" review","Like the Minutemen's music, here's a quick ""econo"" review of this documentary film (don't blink yer eyes or ya might miss it...):Minutemen = amazing trio, who recorded amazing, creative short punk/jazz/whatever -influenced tunes!Minutemen catalog = amazing discography, which should ALREADY be at the head of your music collection!Minutemen documentary = ""WE JAM ECONO,"" which chronicles their heyday, their lives, & their music!These guys lived their music & their ethos!!In summary, three short words pertaining to three outstanding musicians: BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!...Told ya it was gonna be short..."
4,I enjoyed both these films,"I watch a lot of exploitation, grindhouse type flicks, many of them are easily forgotten, and formulaic, these 2 however, are both quite memorable, and and both are ""good"" bad movies, Devil times five is Lief Garrett, and a bunch of psycho orphans terrorizing a family in the northern California mountains in the middle of winter, I am partial visually to movies with cool backdrops like this, the film has a good pace and kept my interest throughout. Mark of the Witch starts out a bit slow, but quickly finds it's rhythm, this one has gobs of 70's retro cliche, and turned out to be really good, A collage girl gets possessed by the spirit of an ancient witch and frighting hilarity ensues. This double feature may not truly merit the 4stars Ive given it, but I watch so many bad forgettable films, the fact that both these movies kept my interest and kept me entertained is about all I can ask for from any low budget 70's flick."
4,Thought-provoking read,"very interesting and challenging book! statements, though frequently controversial when taken at face value, are backed by a great deal of very surprising research. one problem with the assessments we use is that they can often be seen as culturally biased, so bear that in mind. nonetheless, put aside what you've heard, read the book, and decide for yourself. try to keep an open mind and take in all of the data before you form an opinion."
3,What I want To Know,"After reading the book the one item that springs to mind is.....Since the data was published what do real results show?I see a lot of people either supporting or attacking the methods used in the book. To me this is unecessary if we just look at what the real world shows us. (I will admit I have not)To me the analysis gives us a good place to start but unless true relevence is found one way or the other its meaningless.Its like this, I can show you a whole range of things that you can do to (in theory) your car to make it run faster.However if we never measure the cars preformance all we have is me telling you a bunch of stuff. In the meantime we'll have a bunch of other mechanics come on and say, no what he is tellng you is wrong and here is why (debate)"
1,A justification for bigotry,"This long, boring book is a rationalization for a wealthy class privilege, ""the cognitive elite"". What a scandal of self- rationalizations of class inequality! How much common sense or intelligence do you see from our politicians who decide our fate? This book is a waste."
1,Eugenic pseudoscience of the swine.,"This book is blasphemy. It labels African Americans & Hispanics as ""genetically disabled"" and claims they are intellectually inferior due to heredity, asserting that neither education nor training can change this. Is that not racist? Sha! Current evidence shows heritability of IQ does not indicate a genetic origin to group differences in intelligence. Furthermore, an individual's compliancy and adaptibilty to social laws & norms does not necessarily define one's intellegence. Some of the smartest men in history were known to be social outcasts and were referred to as criminals in their time. I have to dismiss this book as nothing more than euro-elitist rubbish. I'm reminded of the movie 'Trading Places' with Eddie Murphy. Read 'The Mismeasure of Man' for further rebuttals on this book."
1,Sorry folks...,"...Murray and Herrnstein were never qualified to write a book on genetics and IQ; they spent their entire careers studying other things. In many of their studies, the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), a knowledge based test, was used to test for IQ. In all the reviews of the book I have ever read, of all the people I have ever discussed this book with, not one person has ever had anything to say about the fact that many of the studies in this book were funded by a neo-nazi organization. Its very likely none of you out there will have anything to say about this either. BTW, statistics can be manipulated to show almost any conclusion; anybody who doesn't know or realize this isn't too bright. Staticians also have studied the data and found numerous errors and manipulations...Oh yeah, my name is Robert Bracco."
4,A must read if you want to have intelligent debates,"Regardless of how you feel on the subject on genetics and I.Q., you must read the book if you want to be able to argue intelligently. This book has been mis-represented by both those arguing against it and those arguing for it. Only those people who actually read it will be able to participate in progressive debates.The book is long and difficult to read. Unless you have a true love, and understanding, of psychometrics there are several sections you will want to skim through (quickly).However, if we, as a country, are to ever make progress on issues of race, education, and affirmative action we should all have an understanding of the issues we are arguing. Otherwise we will fall into the traps of speculation and uninformed opinions."
5,Statistically Valid,"I went back to this book again after recently spending a day in an Emotional Intelligence workshop (a theory which is all the rage). Of course, EI is pseudo-pop science. The Bell Curve, on the other hand, draws statistically signficant causal relationships from the data - that IQ and economic performance go togehter in this economy. Unfortunately, in these sensititve times, some folks chose to interpreted the results as racist. What we really should take from this book is a renewed motivation to get a better grasp on the cognative abilities necessary to succeed in a capitalist society."
2,"Insipid narrative, short of proof or reference","I had opened myself up to some revolutionary thinking when I started reading this book, but was sorely disappointed.Although some of their points do make sense, there is lack of any substantial proof to substantiate the authors' hypothesis. Some of their views are downright outrageous, when they preach that the public systems of the United States (which as per them, is currently tailormade for the less intelligent) should become such that the genetically inferior should be naturally reduced, if not eliminated."
1,The Other Side of the Bell Curve,"In this day in age, it is amazing to witness the continued praise for the Bell Curve. This continues despite a mountain of empirical research which demonsrates unequivocally that the environment, socio-economic status, and social tier into which one is born deeply affects individual success. Most scholars hold that intelligence, however measured - and, indeed, many measures of intelligence have been created, is but a single variable in the complex make-up of human behavior. The explanations offered by the authors of The Bell Curve do not acknowledge entire fields of study which have long ago established the critical role of society in the development of human behavior. It is important to seek out explanations that do not rely on single and simplistic variables to establish causal relationships. This is especially true when discussing the complexities of social structure."
4,Very interesting and thorough,"The book takes a detached perspective on what everyone else analyzes from a subjective standpoint. Books of this kind are rare and valuable to own/read for that reason. At some points in the book the authors slip and make policy advices based on correlation, rather than causation. For instance they say that people with lower IQs are overrepresented in prisons, however it could simply mean that they are more likely to get caught, rather than they are more prone to anti-social behaviour. If you can keep a sceptical mindset, this book will enrich you."
3,Very theoretical,"The authors apparently haven't met a lot of Mensans. Mensans have all scored in the top 2 percentile on IQ tests but have very different lifestyles. Many of them are not rich at all. Wealth is a matter of ambition and a healthy dose of luck. Think beautiful women with average IQ's who marry rich. Think movie stars, rappers, models, and athletes who make millions per year. In comparison, many NASA airspace engineers start with $60K per year after 4 yrs of college and a Ph.D."
1,It represents a human fallacy !,"I can only advice anyone not to be blinded by the jargon and falsely executed statistics. Anyone who is seriously interested in the ongoing debate ""Does intelligence as an enitiy that is inherited and unalterable exist ?"" should read ""The Mismeasure of Man"" by Stephen Jay Gould. I can only express my deepest regret and resentment towards a book that represents a human fallacy that has encumbered our societies for over century and doesn't seem to vanish."
2,"The same old bias, now with ""scientific evidence""","This book tries to show that differences in intelligence are based on genetics rather than opportunity. This is an essential liberal verses conservative debate. While most of the attention is on blacks, all groups are misrepresented. The modernization of Africa refutes it as does the fact that Asian countries often fall behind Europe and America. Is black jazz less intelligent than Frank Sinatra? People often denied a college education can excel at sports because of resourcefulness, not genes. How do you determine the need for IQ anyway? I don't have a college degree, but I know how to run a spell checker (unlike the people who praised this book). As a liberal I will admit that a dog can't compete with a person but racial differences have been proven false."
1,Proven Racists,"Both of the authors of the Bell Curve are already proven racists. I've done some research at a website about the book and it's been proven that Murray (co-author of ""The Bell Curve"") had participated in Cross burnings in the past. Also, Herrnstein was picketed at Harvard University for lecturing his racist views. These are facts. The book is nothing more than ambiguous psuedoscience."
1,Terrible.,"This book is quite simple. It all boils down to this: The poor are poor because they are not intelligent. The rich are rich because are they intelligent. It is a pure right-wing, ultra conservative book that has been used as ""scientific fact.""If one does a bit of research on Charles Murray and reads his other books like Lost Ground (a scalding critique of welfare) and Beyond Probation, it is easy to see that this is more conservative ideology disguised as ""fact"" or ""science."" If you are extremely conservative and wish to read through a book that just confirms what you already believe, by all means, read this book. However, if you are looking for a true contribution to social science and class relations, look elsewhere."
1,If you read this book you must also read Stephen Jay Gould,"The Bell Curve is racist science and the authors' methodology has been systematically debunked. For the award-winning book that finally tears down the Bell Curve myth read ""The Mismeasure of Man: The Definitive Refutation to the Argument of The Bell Curve,"" by Stephen Jay Gould."
1,I didn't like this book.,"Its theories and analyses seem very unconvincing. But maybe that is because I am black, of lower intelligence and thus can't ever be expected to understand such piercing scientific fact. So all I can hope is that along the fateful road of neo-Darwinism that is set extinguish people like me, someone in this world will intervene. Perhaps my artistic abilities will be of value to evolution; perhaps my sagacity or physical agility. Or how about my leadership qualities? But alas, these too may be the exclusive domain of those who sit atop the bell curve, sounding the death knell for people like me. So if you are reading this, I am very sorry for wasting your time with my low level thought processes."
2,The Book's Conclusions Are Based Upon Improper Data Analyses,"After this book's publication, many distinguished researchers have written about what they conclude are its incorrect analyses of data and of the authors' fundamentally wrong conclusions about race, IQ, and socioeconomic problems."
2,SKETCHY STATS MAKE FOR DUBIOUS SCIENCE,"To sum up this book in 25 words or less, I'd say that Herrenstein and Murray above all give readers the absolutely false impression of The Bell Curve as being real science. This is a good read for those who want to brush up on their logic skills--every other sentence seems to call for a handwritten question or criticism in the margin. The statistical conclusions in this book alone are enough to render the work questionable. But throw in tons of contradictory information, racist ideology, and misinterpretation of conventional intelligence tests, and you've got yoruself an 800-page work of purely unsubstantiated rhetoric."
5,Someone with the courage to say something about statistics.,I urge everyone to read this book. Finally some people with the courage to speak out about the direction our country is headed. People who lay the blame on the PEOPLE instead of the SYSTEM.
3,"Bold, daring, controversial","I read this book seven years ago and am just now getting around to reviewing it. IQ is definitely one of the most deciding factors in how far we go in life; but I think the book overlooks other contributing factors that also shape who we are: common sense, emotional intelligence, etc. Biology is not necessarily destiny. Our upbringing and environment also play a crucial role."
2,Read Biology as Ideology by RIchard Lewontin (1991),"Lewontin's book describes a case in which white and black adopted children's IQ scores are measured. What were the findings? Although there was not a significant difference in overall performance (between black and white), the children scored about 20 points higher than their biological parents, which means that CULTURE (their current adoptive parents and the parent's wealth/education), and not biology, has a overwhelming impact on the lives of adopted children. But if one were curious as to which race did do better, the answer is the Black kids. I suppose the point is to have a reasonable amount of skepticism about the claims that modern science makes about the differences in races, as opposed to the differences in opportunities and position of the parents in society."
1,Psuedoscience at its worst,Everything in this book has been proven wrong time and again. The only value this title holds is as a demonstration of how bad science can become so popular when it justifies a belief many already hold.
1,Malicious and racist,"There is simply no way the authors can have believed what they were writing. The 'research' is presented in academic style with copious footnotes. Problem is that the footnotes don't bear any resemblance to what is being said. There are elementary arithmentical mistakes in several of the tables, which curiously always seem to support the authors preconceived notions.If you are a racist goon looking for support for your views you will find much that reinforces your predjudices in this book. However you could save your money and read the output of the 'Institute for Historical Review' for free. If you are looking for an unbiased analysis of IQ testing a better place to start would be Gould's Mismeasure of Man which explains the origins of IQ testing as a means of measuring achievement of the mentally retarded."
3,Take some leave some,"If inventive power is related to high IQ how is it that not much inventions comes from the East Asian part of the world, where the IQ rate is the highest (estimated at 105)? Most inventions are from Caucasian countries (Europe and U.S.) where IQ rate is 100. Isin't it?"
1,disfortune...,"The unfortunate thing about this book, and really about all the positive reviews posted here, is that they are all fundamentally flawed. That is, any philosophy or line of thought which points to biological determinism is impossible to truly justify and thus, should be considered inconsequential and irrelavent to intelligent discussion. The fact is, this book is only what it is because of its support from all these self-described ""rationalists"" who are really just racists and/or fascist-market capitalists. There is not a whole lot in this book that holds up under critical examination unless the examiner is not making any attempt at criticism in an attempt to justify the hate and destruction of systems and societies which they are afraid to leave behind."
1,Pure Garbage,"My dictionary defines racism as ""the notion that one's own ethnic stock is superior"". This book is quintessentially racist. It claims that the average white of European ancestry has an IQ of 100. The average Jewish person has an IQ of 115. The average for blacks and Amerindians is 85. A large percentage of blacks, Indians and Latinos are uneducable. This is determined by heredity, and there is nothing can be done about it. Education makes smart kids smarter, but it over-taxes dumb kids, and actually makes them dumber... Was this book actually written by adult high school graduates???"
1,This book is a sad attempt at disguised racism.,"As an educator books like this and the postivie reviews endorsing this kind of garbage make me sick. America has abused the I.Q. test for years. Any small amount of research will reveal that the history of testing intelligence in America stems from racism. The reason other races other than rich white people do poorly on I.Q tests and standardized tests is cultural not due to genitics. The tests in America are written to exclude particular cultures, to claim otherwise is ignorant. The reviews praising this book and comparing it to Darwin, are pathetic. Bad science. Bad ideas. Drones following along. This is Hitler logic. Grow up. Think for your self. Morons. These people probably think George W. Bush is an outstanding citizen, and not a trigger happy racist with an adgenda. I am disgusted."
5,A theory to address many social problems,"Essentially, this book rests on the proposition that human intelligence is largely inherited. (60% to 80% according to the authors.) Starting there, the authors show how society has evolved from a hunter/gatherer to an agricultural to an industrial to an information based culture. At each stage, except the last, intelligent people were evenly distributed throughout society at every level and every occupation. In this century, however, the educational system has selected out the most intelligent 10% and marked them for further training. The consequences are intriguing, to say the least. This is a profoundly unsettling book that should be read cover to cover. Forget everything you've heard about it and see for yourself."
3,Raises Interesting Points,"Aside from all the controversial racism issues, the book makes some other valid, troubling points, the first of which is the fact that the lower classes in our society are reproducing at a far greater rate than the upper classes. The book asserts that we are breeding ourselves into stupidity, and the point is hard to argue. Amazing that you can get a book published these days whose sole point is to call the authors of The Bell Curve stupid or racist. Whether they are racist or not- who cares? Let the reader form his or her own opinion as to the value of the work. While I may not agree with some of the author's points, I respect their courage in publishing them in the face of political correctness."
5,Hilarious,"Thank you for a fast shipment, the movie is hilarious. I will definately buy from amazon again. Very reasonable price also. Thanks again for a great movie that i added to my collection."
1,An Absolutely Terrible Movie!,"With such a talented cast, They All should be Embarassed to put out such a poor product! It actually makes some of the most gifted funny people I've seen, appear as though this was their first appearance on screen.So Much potential, Such a waste...Literally not even worth the 5$ I paid for it!!!!!!!"
1,Super Sorry! Do not buy,"This movie was ridiculously corny! David Allen Grier was the only true funny person in the movie. Russ Parr tried way to hard. There were too many parodies (training day, white women and nba players, scareface and a couple more that was too far gone. My advice to you is don't spend your hard earned money on this. Your thought might be that because he directed the Last Stand that this one will be equally watchable but believe me ITS NOT! A terrible disappointment. A major let down."
1,Please DON'T!!!,"This is absolutely one of the worst movies that I have EVER seen, and I've seen a LOT of movies. Every actor here's talent is completely wasted on a ridiculous and buffoonish script. This is the kind of movie that sets Black film making back 100 years. The actors should have been ashamed to make something this horrible, but I guess money talks and integrity walks...Please don't buy this movie and promote this kind of idiocy, if Hollywood believes that we like and will watch this type of imbecilic nonsense they will only make more. Watch the trailers if you don't believe me and see for yourself."
5,Great Kit,This is a very good kit. Well built and has filled a void in my clamp collection. I use them on a fairly regular basis and have been very happy with them. I recommend this kit.
5,Great value,Great value EXCELLENT clamps for all woodworking projects. Product was packaged really well. Smallest size bar clamps aren't that useful and I would rather have more of the large or medium size clamps but you cant argue with the amount of stuff you get for the money.
3,Not a Deal,Bessey clamps are some of the best out there. I priced these clamps out on amazon individually and its cheaper to buy them separately.And you can can customize the clamps you want for close to the same price. Otherwise great clamps for woodworking.
4,Good lawyer book.,"Irving writtes good lawyer stuff. Good plot, good court drama, but what makes the book better are Irvings characters. Warren Blackburn is a sympathetic hero. You root for him to win the case. Warren's character matures as the novel progresses and the reader is invited along. I really enjoyed Warren's personnal development. Johnnie Faye Boudreau is mischevious Texas style. The perferct antagonist to Blackburn. And I like how the book ends. William Safire called this book ""satisfying"" and that it truly is."
1,don't bother,the positive reviews must be planted. i just realized one is by the author himself !! there are more limp cliches in the first chapter than you could possibly bellieve. i didnt bother completing the second chapter. there should be some way of screening stuff like this out !!!!!!
5,Wow!,A great story! Quick fun read but the images stay with you. I read this book not long after it was published and it is still with me 2 years later. I highly recommend it.
1,Scratched CD,"The music is great, but the CD I received, although in the original wrapping, has a scratch on it, and you can't play the first two tracks."
5,great grammar review,If you seek further practice with grammar exercises this book is chock-full of exercises. Great for the medium-advanced French student to reveal grammar points that need work or just for review.
5,Lost and Found!,"I first listened to The Colourfield when I was a wee girl of 14 and practically wore out the grooves on my record listening to it so much. Unfortunately, it was part of my prized record collection that I lost in a house fire when I was in my 20's. Now, in my 30's, I found it once again and all those good feelings came back as I played the first track! I thought it was gone forever but alas- it was not! YAHOO!!"
2,Fats' Christmas CD is NOT special,"Fats' version of Jingle Bells is probably the best one I've ever heard. A rockin' boogie woogie treatment of an old classic. That said, I did not find the rest of the tracks remarkable, and a couple were downright painful to listen to. There was something ""off"" about Fats' rendition of Silent Night; it just wasn't right. For some reason, the title of this CD has been changed from the original ""Christmas Gumbo"" to ""Christmas Is A Special Day."" I thought the gumbo title was better. The only other bright spot is the cover picture on the back...Fats sitting on his sofa, which is the back end of a '59 Cadillac, complete with tail fins and ""FATS"" license plate. Now THAT'S cool!"
2,The first one was better,"I liked a few of the songs on the soundtrack, but the first ""Friday"" soundtrack was better. There were more hip hop and dance songs on the last soundtrack and I think that this soundtrack could have a few more newer songs. I still listen to the last sound track and the new one I don't really know if would buy."
5,Unusually memorable and among my top 10 favorites,"Although I read this book years ago, it still comes to mind when I am asked about the best books I have read. It is especially interesting and touching. Best read while in Paris."
1,Like reading a term paper,"My book club chose this book as a companion piece for Madame Bovary. The conceit appeared interesting -- a riff on Flaubert scholarship, but the wit was negligible. Most of it read like a parody (but unfunny) of term-paper research. The narrator/""scholar"", also a doctor with an unfaithful wife (like Madame Bovary) seemed tacked on to a compendium of factoids. I would not recommend this to anyone but die-hard Flaubert nuts."
2,This bok is very hard to read and enjoy.,"I don't see why this book gets high marks. To me it is inconsequential, un-entertaining, confusing... It's like throwing a ball in the air and waiting for it to drop back. And waiting... And waiting... I can heartily recommend other works by Barnes. But not this one. Read Flaubert instead."
2,Torture,"Just plowing through this for my book club. Not engaging. Too intellectual? A really strange fictional account of a doctor who is obsessed with Flaubert (and I mean obsessed!). While it is an interesting format in which to explore Art and Flaubert, it is too artificial and disjointed for me to enjoy. Maybe this book is meant to be savored and provoke deep thoughts. It did not work for me.I really did enjoy Madame Bovary and did not need to delve this deeply into the author's life. I'm thinking Flaubert would not have liked this book either..."
2,Kindle edition formatting problem,"The kindle edition suffers from an annoying problem in chapter 2. The chapter consists of tables of paragraphs forming a chronology. The text in the table is tiny, and when you click on it to expand it, most of the time the table cell rotates so that you have to read that page in landscape mode. Then you have to click twice to move on to the next ""page"" of the table, and then expand it again and rotate the kindle again. This goes on for the whole chapter. It undoubtedly works in the paper book; not on the Kindle (K3)."
1,Not an interesting read,"Dry, disconnected. I didn't get it at all. Not an easy read, difficult to understand the point the author was making."
3,Okay,"Some of these stories all right, a few good. I chose it because it was edited by Sue Grafton, but I'm not really a short story fan; just like to have a collection for guests, etc."
4,America's Best,"This is a great collection of mystery, suspense and crime stories. They have chosen many talented authors such as Lawrence Block, Janice Law, Scott Bartel, Merril Joan Gerber, and many others. There is violence, drugs, cruelties, a contract killer, and other plots. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Blue grass Dream"""
3,A good read for your commute.,"I just finished reading the book and I agree with the previous reviews I have read. Some of the stories, particularly those by Clark are not worthy of your time. However, many of the stories are quite strong and suspenseful. I read the book during my commute. It was great reading a different mystery everyday.Some of the stories aren't actually ""mysteries"", but they are still, for the most part, well written works."
1,"Joanna Campbell,come back. Your series needs help!!","I have been reading this series ever since it was first published. Ever since I bought the first book that said, ""Created by Joanna Campbell"",I knew there was going to be trouble. The books that Joanna Campbell wrote,not created, were fresh and out-of-the-ordinary. I would read them over and over again, and I cried when Charlie died. Does anyone even remember Charlie, the old grumpy trainer? Nowadays, when I read a newer book, I toss it aside when I'm done and groan. This series thing cannot go on. The new,so-called ""author"" is clamoring to find a good plot. All the plots are the same, now. Whatever happened to the good stuff? I've made a desision to not read any more of the books because without Joanna Campbell writing them, they aren't any good. Sorry, Joanna Campbell, but you've just lost a loyal fan."
1,So What If Wonder Dies,"So what i Wonder dies. It's not like she's talked about much. no one will notice. Oh, And whoever said 'what about holly' Has been a good Thorougbred series reader. holly Died IN book #3!!!!! That's 30 books ago. Holly would be about 60 now. Wonder Was her last foal! I think it would slove a lot of promblems if Christina, Dyland, and Katie just disappered and Cindy, max, and all the other creatures that disappered undisappered. I think it's great now that Sam came back. well that's my two scents."
5,Wait A MINUTE!!!!!!,"I know that Wonder's supposed to die in this book because of having another foal. However, let's think realistically here! First of all, Wonder wasn't supposed to have any more foals and secondly, a twenty-five year old horse does have a high chance of having trouble during labor--especially a horse that had trouble when she was first born. Luckily, this will put an end to Christina's bratty little attitude and quit making this series look more like a ""tragic"" soap operah of stupidity. I'm glad Joanna is looking over these books again, even if she's not writing them. At least these books are improving!"
3,I'm worried about Wonder,"Is Wonder really going? I'm not so sure I want to read this book if she is. I just saw the title, but I'm worried. I don't want her to go! Christina better try to get Legacy back!"
1,havent read it yet.,"Ever since Christina traded WONDERS LEGACY for Sterling Dream, I hated the series.I really think that it's stupid to forget about main characters like, CINDY, MAX, GLORY, SAM, PRIDE, PRINCESS, HONOR, CHAMPION? WHAT HAPPEND? I admit I havent read the series since whenever. But once you write a series you have to stick with the plot. Like the Same characters. sure why not have a few new characters, but don't totally forget about the others! I really wish that Joanna Campbell comes back or Karen Bentley.(I think she wrote about the ones with Glory and Champion). These two authors were the really good ones that DIDN'T FORGET ANY CHARACTERS! Well i guess i said enough, Oh, It is really sad that wonder dies, but, then, like stated, should be the end of the series. Then after that, have mabey a last book that sums it all up. but that is just my opinion"
5,So sad!,"This book was really sad, but also really good. I thought it made Ashleigh seem like a bad guy, although I sort of understand. I can't believe she would let Star go to the Townsends! How could she do that when she could see Christina loved Star so much! I know Ashleigh missed Wonder terribly, probably all readers do, but I really thought it was mean to do that to Christina when that was what Ashleigh didn't want to happen in ""A Horse Called Wonder"" I think she was acting mean and I didn't like thinking of Asleigh as a bad guy. I like her, she is one of my faves, but I think she could've been nicer in this book.P.S. **********STAR RULES**********"
1,What About Wonder,"I'm sorry for writing this review, but I miss Joanna's old series, and I don't think I am alone. I'm sick and tired of reading about Christina, (and sorry if that's not her name, I don't read these books) I want to read about Ashleigh and Wonder. I fell in love with books like ""Ashleigh's hope"" and ""a horse called Wonder"" Not when Ashleigh is grown up with a dumb kid. I love the new Ashleigh series with Stardust, but happened to Wonder. In conclusion, I think Joanna should find her roots and stick to them. Thank you"
5,Excellent!,"This was a great book! Even though my fav is Camp Saddlebrook, this is at the top too! One word to sum it up: EXCELLENT! These books are getting so much better, but I don't see why you all hate Chris so much. She is my favorite. And those of you who think she's stuck up, I DON'T think so. And I hated it when Ash ignored Star. He was Wonder's last foal. I don't think Wonder would want Ash to ignore her last foal! Ash is smart. She should have figured that out! Overall I luved the book. What'd you think ?"
2,DON'T TAKE WONDER AWAY!,I have been reading thoroughbred since third grade(I'm a ninth grader now). Wonder has always been in the story. It's just not right to not have Wonder in the Thoroughbred! I volunteer for Free S.P.I.R.I.T. Riders Inc. and we have horses that are 33 years old! Please for the sake of the other readers and I don't take her away now! Also PLEASE BRING BACK EVERYONE THAT HAS EVER BEEN IN THE THOROUGHBRED SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!
1,No!,Wonder cannot die. I am not readin this series anymore. She's only 24 most horses live past that!
1,When did my fave series go down the drain?,"I must say that I'm sooooo sad to see Wonder die. She was the reason thoroughbreds exist! I would have been able to handle it ok but not only is onder dieing but I'm desperately missing other horses! Where are Wonders offspring gone? Are we ever going to hear how Legacy's going? And Fleet Goddess deserves a bit more credit too! Whatever happened to Precosious? As much as I hated Cindy, I am starting to miss her and Glory, after they where violently shoved from the series. To conclude my reveiw, I will say that I will always read this series, hoping that good 'ol Joe will start to write more."
2,What happened to this series,"I have been sharing this series wiith my niece since it was created by Joanna Campbell. Ever since the publisher made the awful decision to produce a book every couple months the series has gone downhill. In order to produce this many books you have to have many writers. With many writers you lose continuity. Joanna's writing produced well thought out characters and story plots. The other authors have created a royal mess with confusion, lost characters, and weak plots. I know that Joanna tried to get the publisher to understand this. I personally would like to know what happened to Sierra, Cindy, and Max. As for this book, I personally would have never foreseen the manner in which Ashleigh acts. If you want to talk about bratty, lets talk about an adult acting bratty. Yes I cried but what could have been a memorable book quickly turned into a truly weak effort. I keep hoping that Joanna will come back. Until then I think the series will continue to go downhill."
1,"Without Feeling, Emotion, or Creativity","The title of this review says it all. The Thoroughbred series have gone downhill. Finally we have the Christina we want, but where the heck are the other characters and horses? My advice to the publisher, bring Joanna back! These books are badly-written, without feeling, emotion, or creativity. To the new authors, I'm sorry, but this just doesn't cut it."
2,What???????,Just to let you know I haven' actully read this book but i've skimmed through it. What the heck is going on? All of a sudden Dylan is not mentioned anymore. What's up with that. And then in the next few books Christina turns into a racing fanatic. Why isen't she doing eventing? I mean she's the one who got got me interested in eventing. I loved these books. I think they they should have had Christina stick with eventing and have Melanie do the racing. I loved Christina but now she's only ok.What's the deal with Parker suddenly joing series. I've read a lot of the other books past this one and I have to say the best are #51 and #70-72. Oh I have to say that thy shouldn't have ended the book #72 like they did. (It's a great book by the way.) Most of the books past this one have just gone downhill. I love the thoroghbreed books but a lot of them could be better. Don't you agree?
5,Very Sad,"Okay, so Wonder had to die sometime. I mean, it's a fact of life. I think the author did a preety good job. It seems that Star and Christina will now be like Wonder and Ahsleigh. I just read a realy good horse book called Shadow Horse. Cool mystrey and lots of good horse stuff."
5,I CRIED MY EYES OUT IT WAS SO SAD!!!!!!!,"This has to be the saddest book in the Thoroughbred series. It was a big shame that Wonder died after giving birth to Star. And what made me even more mad is that Ashleigh decided to let Townsend Acres train Star and riun him. Of Wonder's last foal, how could Ashleigh do that to Star and Christina?!? And when ever Ashleigh walked in the broodmare barn, she never even noticed Star. She acted like it wasn't even there!! Until Christina found out what was wrong with her mom, it broke her heart looking as if she didn't even want him there. Even though Star looked exactly like Wonder, that doesn't give Ashleigh the right to ignore him. The end was probably the saddest part when Brad came up with his father, Mr. Townsend, to take Star away from Whitebrook and Ashleigh didn't even say goodbye to him. It is obvious that Brad is going to ruin the horse before he can even race."
1,Too Much Polemic,"I was so looking forward to a good book on the geology and history of Texas rivers. I was disappointed. The travelogues are sketchy but useful. In every chapter, over and over again, we hear that industrilization is bad for rivers, dams stop the free flow of rivers, and that Ango settlers stole the land from native Americans. Yes, that's true and probably can be profitably discussed in a preface. Something like John Graves ""Good Bye to a River"" engenders sympathy and makes you care about the rivers. Huser's treatment of the subject leaves the reader merely irritated at the author."
5,Canoeing Texas' rivers,"No other book covers all of this great state's rivers like Verne Huser's book. His thoughful, detailed narrative is a personal journey, a natural history discussion and a paddler's guide."
3,A Little Disappointing,"My expectations may have been set a little to high. Don't get me wrong... this was a good movie, but I expected a little more from the ending. Honestly, I was thinking throughtout the movie that the mistress was really a man which would have been what I considered a shocking ending. However, the real ending was expected and not a surprise at all. The movie was also way too long and just seemed to drag along. I'm also not a big fan of subtitles since I can't fully watch the acting while reading the titles (and it does seem like French subtitles go really fast). I just was a little let down, but it is worth watching ."
4,A great mystery film with Hitchcock elements,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This film, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot is one of the greatest French mystery films I have seen. In the film, a school principal is very mean to his wife and mistress. They team up to drown him and dump his body in a pool. Later they begin to suspect that he wasn't dead when they dumped him in the pool. The film has a surprise ending that I will not reveal as it would be considered a spoiler.The DVD dies not have any special features, but is still a really good film. The film had a remake done in 1996 with Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani. I have not seen the remake but intend to sometime soon."
5,Le Diabolique,A frightening crime caper from 1955 directed by multi award winning French filmmaker Henri-Georges Clouzot
1,DUBBED! UGH!,"The VHS version of ""Diabolique"" pictured here (black-and-white cover, ""Hollywood Classics"" series) is a dubbed version of the French original. There is no notation on the slipcase or tape itself to advise the viewer of that fact. Stay away from this product!"
3,Sub-par for Criterion,"With all the wonderful, high-quality disks I've bought from the Criterion Collection, I was markedly disappointed with this one. While the movie was fantastically eerie and deserving of four stars(although I believe Hitchcock would have done a much finer, more suspenseful, 5-star job), the quality of the print was far inferior to every other Criterion disc I've bought thus far. The film is quite scratchy and has some very noticeable flaws throughout. After such fine discs as The Third Man, The 39 Steps, and The Lady Vanishes, the quality of this more recent film was a disappointment."
5,Real Horror!,"I first saw this as the original in a movie theter when I was a teenager and it was the scariest movie I ever saw. It is still an excellent example of the genre, if not still the most terrifying experience I have had from a movie, even though I already know the plot. One of the reasons for its success is that there are no fancy sets, no supernatural effects, no ghosts . . . a story that can take place just about anywhere. The modern re-make is an insult to the original and should be scrapped."
4,Know Your History,"It's easy to understand why Alfred Hitchcock was influenced by Diabolique. Many still believe this to be one of the greatest thrillers ever filmed. The movie contains many of what would become Hitchcock trademarks, clean editing, edgy themes, and escalating suspense. Two scenes stand out: the swimming pool sequence and the return of the victim. Though the movie may move a bit slowly for today's audiences, those two scenes alone make this must see cinema."
2,Choose another version of this classic thriller.,"I thought this ""restored"" version was subtitled in English - it says so on the jacket- but it's dubbed, and poorly at that. The audio in this particular version offered at $12.99 is often difficult to understand. The voices of some of the boys are too mature for their ages and the some of the other characters' voiceovers do not fit their physiques or personalities. The video quality couldn't be any worse in a six dollar version with white subtitles. KW, Melbourne, FL, USA"
3,"Poor follow up of ""The Third World War""","This is the follow up book written after ""The Third World War"". It has less combat action and more Geopolitics than the first book. Acctually, the book is about 95% politics.Before you start reading it get out your best world map, as the author is constantly talking about important towns and cities that are so small most altas's don't show them, so you can never figure out exactly where the Russians are advanceing to and from.If you are into politics of the cold war, this is the book for you, if you want action, don't waist your time."
1,"Book is Public Domain, Available Free Online","Written in 1921, its no longer copyrighted. No need to buy it when you can download it free.In fact, the printing I received seems to be a poorly formatted PDF printout of an older scanned copy (in a fancy binding). It seems to include some underlining and comments from the owner of the original book.I felt a little cheated by the publisher - Bibliolife."
1,Dont Waste Your Time On This One.,"Cardozo cannot string a sentence together that is simple and clear. He may have been a judicial giant, but how would you know from his writing? Richard Feynman, the physicist, said it best when he observed that anyone who cannot communicate what they know, clearly and simply, does not know their subject very well. The whole thing is a chore to decipher into common language. It makes you wonder if Cardozo wasnt one more Hoover screw-up."
3,Fairly Typical of the Era,"Although 2 of Dion's biggest are here, the rest of the LP/CD is typical of the early 60's LP formula; hits, covers & filler. The fact that this is Dion makes it more attractive, but I'd either go for a hits compliation or the Ace release from several years ago, ""Runaround Sue/The Best of the Rest""."
5,chashing bears review,"I think that chashing bears is a very good book and that the forester family got closer, that danny grew stronger and stronger and that him and his dad hank got closer and that mike gain some respect for danny and knew if danny wanted to be a computer freak he can be and if he was weak he was weak..."
5,Duke's Concert Shines On!,As a long time fan of the Duke I finally got to see one of his Disco Era Concerts from this Japanese Concert in 1983. The songs are somewhat biased to his albums 79-83 but who cares! This one is really funkin! I had a big smile on my face the whole concert and Duke is really a master of improvisation - he's the real thing and just like a big cuddly teddy bear he carries the concert to a wonderful climax with a 10 minute rockin' version of Shine On. I just wish I had been there and now you can finally have a glimpse of that moment.Highly Recommendable even for not die hard fans.The 5.1 sound is actually really good remastered. Well balanced and very clear.A+
4,Strategic Business Partner,Well written coaching guide for HR folks wanting to be more strategic in their work w/ organizations. Good working examples throughout to get you thinking of where you can add value as well as items to work on for your specific situation.I happened to meet Dana & Jim Robinson since they live in my neck of the woods. Extremely nice people & well versed in the strategy modes.
3,Mixture of Dolby from the years gone by,"Its a good collection of Dolby songs from albums that he has produced over the years, exception being that there are no songs from GOTHIC or THE GATE TO THE MIND'S EYE, both of which were produced for other intentions. It includes songs that are not included on other albums, LEIPZIG and URGES, both of which are easily recognizable as Dolby's EARLY efforts. Its interesting to notice the change in styles over the years that this album covers. From the earliest hit of SHE BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCE (GAofW) to the CRUEL of his last album (A&H). Some noteables missing would be the sequel to EUROPA AND THE PIRATE TWINS (GAofW), EASTERN BLOC (A&H) and KEYS TO HER FERRARI (ALIENS..BUICK). But it is a good album to get an idea of where Dolby has come, and possibly where he is going."
1,Absolutely terrible,"""She Blinded Me With Science"" has to be the worst piece of anything ever created in the history of this planet. Dolby has absolutely no talent as a musician or a human being."
5,The best single CD,"I picked up this CD because I had some nostalgic pangs for when I first heard ""Europa and the Pirate Twins"" in high school. And I was amazed with the rest. I had heard much of this music before when it first came out, but the distance made me realize what a fine musician Dolby is.""She Blinded Me With Science"" is the obvious hit here, and the weakest selection. Dolby went through a lot of stylistic transformations and proved himself adept at everything he touched. The secret is that he wrote good songs, that's what these are, and the production of them is really musical. ""Hyperactive,"" ""Leipzig,"" ""Screen Kiss"" and ""I Love You Goodbye"" are all so very different and so very good. ""Close But No Cigar"" is simply hilarious, and humor is the hardest thing to do well in music. Not just for teeny-boppers either, Dolby is an adult pop musician, and this is a fine collection of excellent music. You'll love it."
3,"Good information, but a little dry","This is one of the better sex advice books I've read. I found a lot of interesting information and it's my understanding that the author is quite versed on the topic. However at times (and maybe this is due to the size of the book) I felt that I was back in college reading a textbook. It's definitely not a book that you sit down to read cover to cover, so I guess it's good they included a helpful index. Okay so where's the g-spot again? My husband hasn't found it yet. :P"
4,I was more naive than I thought. This book cleared that up!,"I only bought this book because I know the author's mother. It was very enlightening in a very matter of fact way. The book didn't try to sell one on any particular lifestyle, except to be open to possibilities. Not a book I would want my young children to read"
3,Mixed Review,"The Good Vibrations Guide to Better Sex must be taken in its context. While it does a fabulous job on philosophy and manages to appeal (and include!) everyone on the sexual spectrum, it is disappointingly light on technique. If you are of the more jaded persuasion and are fairly comfortable with your body and sexual appetites, this is not the book for you (there is not much to reccommend it in the way of new information). I was impressed to see that the sex toy section of the book was of notable length and expertise (but these are the folks who do it best) and to encounter the totally unapologetic enthusiasm for the kinkier aspects of the art of sex. It is a good guide for those starting out, but not of much use to the more experienced participant. (However helping out the good gals of Good Vibes is always a worthy cause!)"
4,If your looking to go green don't overlook this.,I found this book very interesting. I love growing plants & I like the option to make my own products instead of buying products that I don't know what all is in them.
2,A Diappointment,"I was given one of Kate West's other books (RW's Garden), and thoroughly enjoyed it, even if some of the information was rather common knowledge. I bought this book in the hopes of finding something that could be helpful to reference, with perhaps some new recipies and ideas to try.Unfortunatly I was sorely disappointed. The fact that the author suggests the use of pre-made lotions and soaps is bad enough, but the fact that there appaears to be little research other than her own trial and error makes it all the worse. And to add insult to injury, my copy was missing four pages. Luckly this meant that I could take it back for a refund, but it just made the experience that much more annoying.In short, look at other books before buying this one - there are pleanty out there that deal with the advertised subject material in greater depth."
4,Best in the Series,"This book was the best in this four book series about a family torn apart by the murder of their mother. Abby and Jonah produce sparks from the moment they meet. Abby, the lone daughter in a family of ranchers, is an ace horse trainer. Jonah is the cavalry officer who takes pride in his honor. When he falls in love with Abby, Jonah almost lets her go because he promised to marry another woman. I really liked this book, but it was a good thing I read this one first instead of the others in the series. They did not quite reach the standard set here."
5,Moon Racer,I enjoyed this book immensely. It was part of four book series. I could hardly wait to receive to find out what was happening the person it was about.
2,Could be a spurious item.,"The name 'Mastech' on the meter as shown in the picture is missing. Instead of 'Mastech', 'Sinometer' is there in the equipment I received. No model number also on the meter. Instruction manual also missing the Mastech name.plasticlizard, Please post the online instruction manual which will be useful as you said."
3,Decent multimeter,"This meter has a lot of features that makes it attactive as a good all purpose meter. It is easy to use; however, I found that the battery tester only works at the 9V setting regardless of which battery type you are testing. The 3V and 1.5V settings do not work."
4,Very Pleased with the view,"I ordered these because the older pair of Jason's that I have are, well...old. I looked everywhere for a new pair and used the Amazon reviews as my guide. As it turns out, it worked.The only drawback I have with the binoculars are the lens caps. The large object protective covers, suck. They are difficult to remove and put on. The eyepiece end is easier, but I think Nikon could do better.I use these for stargazing and birding and these are perfect for the job!"
3,Nikon EX ATB Binocular,The field of view is limited other than that it is a good value for purchase price. It also does not come with a shoulder strap for the carry case.
2,Disappointed,"My main purchase was to have middle ranged binoculars for astronomy. Most amateur astronomers raved about Nikon binos, and I figured that I was in for a treat. When I received the pair, I looked outside during the day and was impressed with the views I experienced and was excited to see what they offered at night. Hate to say it, but the view was equal to my much cheaper 10x50 Bushnell binoculars. I was barely able to view Jupiter's Galilean moons, Pleiades was sharper with Bushnell than with the Nikons and the moon, while beautiful, was not impressive in comparison with my cheaper binocs. I tried to like them, and at first was going to keep them for daytime viewings, but, my main purpose for binoculars is for my astronomy hobby. Returned them the next day after 3 hours of frustrating and disappointing night viewing of the skies.I must say, however, that Amazon was phenomenal...my refund was provided on a timely basis. They may work for others, but, I was not impressed."
2,Disappointed,We live on the northern tip of the Keewenaw Penninsula of Michigan on Lake Superior and purchased them to view passing laker and ore boats. Ships pass under 5 miles out from our cabin and we hoped to be able to read the names of the ships. These didn't quite cut it and are only marginally better than our Bushnell 8x40. Otherwise as advertised. Not as heavy as some reported and they are tripod mountable anyway.
4,Good Optics for the Money,"Pros: Solid construction, very decent optics, bright image, minimal distortion, comes with tripod adapter, nicely built wide strap.Cons: Poor lens cap design on both ends (inconvenient to use), flimsy case that is lacking a carry handle. You can use the strap on the binos as a carry handle by extending it out after closing the flap with the binos inside the case.Overall I think it's worth the money for the product & power. Using a tripod or monopod would also make viewing easier."
4,all the PiL you will ever need,"This box set is fantastic. It has all the important material PiL recorded, plus a few rarities - B-Sides, Peel Sessions, 12"" mixes, etc. Be warned, I docked this a point because of the last disc - latter day PiL is stoooopid , low brow rock music, it has none of the feeling of fresh inventive enthusiasm that their early work does. Listen to the first three discs, use the fourth as a coaster."
5,The ultimate Public Image Ltd. collection.,"THE PLASTIC BOX is the four-disc collection of the best of the music tracks from the Public Image Limited (a.k.a. The John Lydon Band). The first two discs are the best of the bunch (when they still were a collective unit). Disc three and four are best used as coasters (unless you love the John Lydon version of P.I.L.). Instead of searching out for the first three albums, you can get them all collated in this box set. The plastic box also comes with a nice booklet with pictures and thoughts from John Lydon.If you love Public Image Limited (either versions) then you must seek out this set. You wont be sorry.Highly recommended."
5,One of the best boxed sets ever!,"John Lydon's post-Johnny Rotten work stands as living proof that the man was more than just the wailing, cackling frontman of punk rock's most lucrative and enduring brand name. This box set succeeds where most retrospectives fail, by balancing the scope of the band's official discography with bonus goodies (remixes, sessions, and unreleased material) of true tangible value. No wanky fodder here, folks... everything on these 4 discs truly matters to the genuine PiL enthusiast. OUTSTANDING."
5,Gray Mist at Dawn,"As a personal disciple of Shellyji, I found this book to be an accurate and refreshing glimpse into the, otherwise unkown, inner world of Kriya Yoga as he taught it. This book goes beyond the ordinary, into the hidden pathways of the universe and gives the reader a glance at what the future may hold for the sincere student of the truth. This is not a book for the faint of heart but rather a unique blend of physical and spiritual reality for those beings who feel they are ready for such an adventure. It is all too easy to view the universe as safe and traditionally we are taught to do so. This book will assist in opening the eyes of those who are beginning to realize that they are asleep."
1,Bosch Oxygen sensor,"Installed on Sep 2012 and failed on Nov 2012, on Toyota corolla 1997. People says Bosch do not work with Japanes cars."
1,Don't buy for Toyotas,I failed smog because my O2 sensors didn't work. I bought Bosch sensors and failed again; the reults were worse. I then bought Denso sensors and passed. The smog guy told me never buy Bosch for Japanese cars. Fortunately Amazon allowed me to return the Bosch sensors. But buying Bosch sensors probably wasted about 8 hours of my time.
1,Lousy,"Carmit Delman whines, whines, and whines some more about being too poor to afford a lavish party for her ninth birthday. She has an interesting and dynamic family story, but everything about it is hampered by her bad writitn.Whoever published the book should've insisted on a rewrite."
4,Unique Memoir,A very different take on growing up Jewish in the United States. You won't find the usual lox and bagels stories here.
5,More ABBA Gold: More ABBA Hits ~ ABBA,"Bee Gees and ABBA totaly dominated the airwaves during the 70's and when one listens to their music it is easy to understand why. Both bands were so dominant compared to what all the other bands released at the time. This their second hits album is just as amazing with tracks such as angel eyes, the day before you came, under attcack, summer night cirty and many more. The day before you came is probably one of their strongest tracks they ever wrote and one can definetely sense the 80's synthpop sound that would have been part of their repoitoire if they had not broken up."
4,On The Same Par As Abba Gold,"I bought this compilation a while after I bought Abba Gold. The songs on here are just as good as on the previous hits release. ""The Day Before You Came"", is my favorite track. Recommended."
3,"Not as good as Gold, but...","Two songs on this album make it worth trying to let the rest of the album grow on me: ""Ring, Ring"" and ""Angeleyes"". Yes, both songs about, surprise, lost or unrequited love, but so catchy! The rest, well, ...I haven't listened to them much since I'm so keen on the two aforementioned songs. By the way, and I'm sure this is a completely origional idea, ""Ring, Ring"" makes a great incoming message on an answering machine."
2,Disappointed!,We really love the CD but were very disappointed that the CD brochure appears to have been wet and is all stuck together ;-( Seller should have mentioned that in it's description. I had not been an ABBA fan until recently and was sad that I could not read the info!!
4,Hate & Like,"I have read some books and magazines about the Holocaust in most of them they say that Hitler is a devil I will like to read books from the opposite side, it is kind of difficult to make a fair judgment, if you read the History of different countries most of them, they didn't like the jewish people and I am including our country when the jews came to USA they changed their last names because they were afraid of something ? at least I don't know, this book is a good information and you know about( Hitler) his ideas what he wanted it and why he hated the jewish people,of course the Holocaust was one the sad episodes in the Human History."
4,Hurst T-Bar shifter,"The Hurst T-Bar shifter was hard to find, but I finally identified a vendor that carried this product. The product was shipped on a timely basis and was in good shape. Everything with this purchase went well."
5,Great,"In addition to this book, he has another that I've read and supposedly a third on the way. Its a great historical analysis of why our country operates and thinks the way it does. I took his class at Augusta State University and enjoyed the lesson in person immenseley"
4,My Little Lambs,"ISBN 0307145026 - Nice, thick, difficult to destroy pages can handle a toddler, and toddlers will want to handle these pages. Short rhymes describe the days of baby lambs, how their fleece keeps them warm and dry and more.The only negative, and not a big one, is that the back cover is in the shape of the mother lamb and is larger than the rest of the book, so it has less support than the other pages and is more likely to bend and break.- AnnaLovesBooks"
5,Awesome single,"One of the best songs Nirvana never released on an album. The Jesus Lizard song is cool too. Definitely recommend to any hardcore fans, and a must-have for collectors like me."
4,Doggy is Dashing,"This harness look great on my black & white pup. It is very easy to get off and on, but be careful if your pet lunges ahead, with the velcro it can easily come undone.The leash is short which is good for control but frustrates the pet."
3,"Somewhat useful, but I regret buying it","It's little more than a glorified glossary, really. No context or alternative renderings provided. The cover is nice, though!"
2,Sometimes you can judge by the cover...,"I loved 'Fun In Space' and found much to enjoy on 'Strange Frontier' but ironically the only track I liked on this record was 'No More Fun'.Tracks such as the overly dramatic 'Horse Whisperers' sound like a history lesson put to music. 'A Nation Of Haircuts' attempts to replicate classic Taylor penned Queen tracks such as 'Drowse' and 'Tenement Funster' but this time around the social comment misses somehow and comes off as lecturing - and the repetition of the title too may times gives the impression of a lack of ideas lyrically.I really wanted to like this release but, like the cover art, it feels half baked - striving for past glories by being too serious and ultimately coming off as being a bit silly."
5,Another overlooked solo outing you should have,"I've been waiting a month for this one. I have the EU version, yet I have ""People on Streets"" (Mashed) on the ""Pressure On"" CD5 (he must have spun them off ""Under Pressure"", I guess). Most people don't realise there's more to the Queen universe than Freddie. Released in Japan by Parlophone/(formerly Toshiba-)EMI."
5,Debut of debuts,"I have been in the classical music industry for over 20 years and have never come across such a powerful debut recording. In terms of artistry, which is very rare these days, you will always find it in Alex Slobodyanik's playing on this recording. His Chopin Sonata is mesmerising and his Papillons are among the best on record. His Kinderszenen demonstrates his virtuosity and breathtaking poetry. Such heartfelt playing, this debut by an enourmous young talent should not be taken lightly."
5,A rare talent,"I usually don't review the items I buy, but in this particular case I couldn't help but log in and put in my five cents. Perhaps it is because of how shockingly off mark the previous reviewer is in regards to this disc. To start off it is possibly the best recording of Schumann's Papillons I've ever heard. Imaginative, daring and fresh. In regards to Chopin even though I would have loved a bit more punch in the Polonaise, the Sonata is among the most powerful on record.This kid is no joke and I truly hope he makes another one soon."
1,a mediocre student,"So dull and well-groomed, one might think it is a mid-term music school exam. It is a real wonder why would a respectable company like Angel/EMI put such trash on disc! A real shame."
4,one of my dog's favorites!,"My dog _loves_ this toy! I first bought him one when he was a (very energetic!) puppy, and only slightly bigger than the toy. I set it down on the floor and he pounced on it immediately and played with it until he was tired out. It can go outside just fine -- being latex, it washes up easily -- so it makes a good outdoor as well as indoor toy. It's fairly tough -- just don't let your dog use it as a chew toy too much. I made that mistake with the first one, and had to replace it about a year later. It's really made for chasing and playing.I've since bought several of the other toys in this series, and while he likes them, this is his favorite."
2,Disappointing venture..,"If you're a fan of his previous cd's, you may be disappointed with this one. Far too Celtic for my taste, and it lacked the imagery intrinsic to his other works. AV takes background to vocals on most of the cuts. Although Eliza Gilkyson has a beautiful, lilting voice, I didn't buy this cd to listen to her. This should be a Gilkyson cd featuring Andreas Vollenweider.As big a fan as I am of AV, I am compelled to only give this 2 stars - one just because it's AV, and the other because it's tolerable for a celtic genre."
3,Vocals take Over!,"The female vocals on this album are mood-destroying, makingit sound less ""ethereal"" and more pop-schlock, which is notwhat I personally want to hear on an AV album. The main singeris not balanced to Andreas' style so it comes off as overbearingto my ears. Sorry , I'll pass on this one."
3,Minstrel wandering off from the track,"Vollenweider and vocals is a refereshing combination, and a bold venture from the norm. Eliza Gilkyson has a sweet singing voice, but hardly the range of Kate Bush, the depth of Loreena McKennitt or the classical discipline of Enya. Still she does a creditable attempt to inject a sense of Celtic drama in the songs. 'Song of Isolde' was the best of the collection for me. Perhaps if they had kept to a Tolkienistic feel with songs from elven Lothlorien, it might have worked better. As it is, 'Reason Enough' and 'Harvest', while interesting arrangements on their own, brought me too jarringly close back to modern reality. Still, 'Eolian Minstrel' isn't without its charm and it's worth a listen now and again."
4,Business Mathematics Is There A Finer Book,"Hi, I would like to tell you how much I enjoyed the Business Math book. The book was so fun and easy to catch on to that before I knew it I was done. This book is thick so you would think it would take you months to do but it dosent.The book is designed as a teacher first they explain the work and give you examples then you do the work and refer to the examples as you would a teacher so thank you for writing this book Colman Goozner."
5,This is a great book!,"We read this book over and over to our two year old. He lovesthe pictures and thinks of nite time when dusk comes around. My son recognizes the dark now thanks to little bear pointing it out to him. I also enjoy the relation to the other little bear book ""Lets Go Home Little Bear"". I like the series and hope to see more Little Bear books published. A big hand for Martin Waddell and Barbara Firth."
4,CAN'T YOU SLEEP LITTLE BEAR,DID NOT REALIZE THIS IS A VERY SMALL BOOK. THOUGHT I WAS GETTING THE NORMAL SIZE. HAD TO COVER A MARK ON THE FIRST PAGE W/ A STICKER.
2,I've Read Better!!!,"This book ""Can't You Sleep Little Bear?"" is not a book that I would suggest to anybody. The story doesn't make that much sense. It talks about how big bear keeps bringing brighter lanterns in, but little bear is still playing games in teh background. The plot isn't that great, and doesn't make that much sense. Then to make things a lot more difficult, they go outside and look at the moon. Why would somebody do that when they are looking for a brighter light source. A large lantern is much brighter then a full moon. I guess he just must of wanted to show little bear the moon, since little bear hadn't seen it before. I have read better books before, but I guess, I have also read some that were worse."
5,"Whitty, entertaining","Richard Kind, Aaron Klieber, Robyne Parrish and Writer/Director Ravi Godse were all very funny. A fast paced comedy and even more entertaining for those who work in the Health care Arenas!!"
3,Quality bonus tracks that continue the Mirror Conspiracy,"A bit of a surprise that this is the first CD-single release off Eric Hilton and Rob Garza's cosmopolitan diamond The Mirror Conspiracy released mid 2000; ""Shadows"" may be a slinky continental delight, but tracks ""Indra"" and ""Lebanese Blonde"" remain some of that album's brighter highlights.Regardless, it's the three extra cuts that TC fans want anyway; the selections continue the multinational theme of Mirror, with ""DC 3000"" showcasing the spacious percussion favored in their material, tempo slowed for the horizontal-inclined. ""Barrio Alto"" is a beach sunset compressed on disc, a lively lone guitar leading a spicy beat that resists the baleric-bore of many similar summer numbers. ""A Guide For I & I"" rings similar to ""Focus on Sight"" with raggae-style vocals.Weighing in at only 16 minutes hinders the value, but the slick, quality b-sides make for a nice mini-Mirror EP. Grade: B"
5,Excellent EP,"Thank goodness I did NOT listen to the other reviewer. This is an excellent CD, that makes your feet want to move. The only ""bad"" thing about it, is that it ends! If you have any interest in ""new music"", BUY this CD. It's worth every penny."
2,"NOT very sturdy, great design, poorly manufactured.","This tripod didn't last one day on our jobsite. It weighs more than 15 lbs, with most of the weight high in the steel elevator shaft. On the way from the truck to the site, one of the cheap plastic clips on the carrying strap at the heavy end of the tripod broke. The top plate hit concrete sidewalk from about three feet. After that, the crank wouldn't raise or lower the elevator at all. It froze and then stripped. Save yourself fifty dollars and buy Stabila's standard tripod. We did."
2,Poor representation of Stabila,"This tripod was attractive to me at first because of the price and features. I also own six Stabila levels of various sizes and love them. So, I bought one and used it. It is very cheaply built. I am a contractor, but take very good care of my tools. They cost a lot and help me make money. Why wouldn't I, right. The plastic clips on the carry strap broke day two. Luckily it fell and dinged me in the leg or I would have suffered the same fate as the other writers. I went to a hardware store and bought some make a strap parts. Wider strap, stronger clips. The following week one of the chains pulled out of the legs. This time I ran into a Stabila rep at my local hardware store. He gave me a number to call and said everything would be made right. Ha, I knew better, five calls over three months and no return call. Again, went to the hardware store and fixed it myself. Have Stabila call me, I'll give them a parts list so they can start building it right."
5,Tripod,This elivator tripod worked great with a rotary laser used for a drop ceiling. It can be adjusted to the height you want leveled then your set to work.
3,A bit tedious at times,"Edward Rutherfurd uses his well known method to describe the history of Russia: take two families from a certain hamlet, start in prehistoric times and follow their adventures, ups and downs in a number of chapters set over the centuries. And by doing this he can give a very good description of historically important events in the area. It worked very well for London, Sarum and The Forest, but I have to say it works less for Russka: at times the stories are long, making them slightly boring and the rivalries between the families are more important than the historical events. There are some interesting chapters, notably Forest and Steppe, Ivan (the Terrible), Peter (the Great) and Revolution, but I had to struggle through some of the other chapters. And then 945 pages is quite a lot..."
4,If you like Russian history.......then this is the book for you!,"I really enjoyed this book. I've been obsessed with Russian history my entire life and have had the opportunity to travel there. This book was well researched, written, composed and crafted. True it is long.......but worth it. I found myself skimming through it at times, but when something is close to 1,000 pages, that's going to happen. Great read and the span of 1,800 years was interesting to say the least."
5,Similar in style to James Michener,"The author writes in a style very similar to James Michener; a saga spread across centuries.Easy to read, a good book for cold winter days in front of a warm fire."
2,Forced & artificial,"While this book is well-written given the scope, many of the chance encounters characters have throughout the book with major historical figures feel artifically forced, and the constant foreshadowing of events to come becomes tiresome. I'm quite amenable to the historical fiction genre -- ""War and Peace"" is perhaps my favorite book -- but this work feels like it was trying to hit a checklist, squeezing in as many events as possible, regardless of narrative value. The plot lines all fit together way too conveniently, occasionally leading to shallow character development as well.The reader would benefit from a passing knowledge of Russian history, and there are a few buried allusions that are nuggets for those very familiar with the field, but the simplistic treatment of the topic will likely turn off readers in the latter category."
3,Not Quite Up to Sarum Standards,"Like many, I picked this up because Sarum impressed me so. For me, this work did not quite live up to that standard.The history side is fine. Russia's history is pretty dramatic all by itself, and Rutherford manages to get to most of the highlights one way or another. Maybe, though, the canvas was just too big-- ultimately the work didn't quite hang together for me as whole. The technique of multiple family lines becomes stretched to the point of breaking. I felt as if I were reading several short books that had no connection other than setting, that successive generations did not build upon or add to those that preceded or followed them. The parts never quite added up to a greater whole as they did in sarum.Still glad I read it, and I would still recommend it for its historical sweep, but he did this better in sarum."
3,"A Large Canvas Thinly Painted, With Too Many Brushstrokes Showing","Of all of Edward Rutherfurd's novels, this is probably the weakest, and not coincidentally it also marks the only occasion in which his books have been set other than on the islands of Ireland or Britain. Somehow Mr. Rutherfurd not only missed his mark in portraying the deep and tragic Russian soul, but the book itself lacks spirit. While Russka does cover most of the notable periods in Russian history, from pre-historic tribes of nomadic horsemen, thru the coming of Christianity, the Mongols, the reigns of Ivan the Terrible, and Peter and Catherine the Great, up through the industrial age and the Soviet Revolution, the characters and situations were just not as compelling or gripping as in everything else of this writer's that I've had the privilege to read."
4,Enthusiastic,Very interesting and revealing historical novel. Gives insite on why Russians think and act like they do.
3,"Low points, high points","I bought this book because I've been always been interested in Russia. However while not disappointing, this book is not an enthralling one. Basically the weak points are in the storytelling. Most of the stories told here are uninteresting, the fictional characters wander too much without adding any to the book. Sometimes the narrative gets to muddled and it wonders me how such a re-edited and revised edition has this many errors. For instance, there's a part where the character is Boris and he's called Ivan. I would caution a lot of attention on this for the editors. High points of course are on history, only when it's explained properly because the author seems to think that the reader knows that much about Russia as he knows, which is not true. I would recommend it to the readers only if they don't care about slovenly narrative when reading history."
3,Not his best work,"I love Rutherfurd's work...all of it. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this novel as well. I found that I didn't care as much about characters and the historical characters lacked depth. This is my least favorite of all his novels."
2,abridged version,"While the story may have been very interesting, because this was a very abridged version, I felt I was missing more than I was learning. Do not recommend."
2,"""Russka"" Does not hold one's interest.","The book is less about Russia and more about weak people. The same was true of his book(s) on Ireland. I guess Rutherford just had one great book in him - ""Sarum."""
4,Enlightening,"I've read many historical novels, mainly about England, but I found Russka to be one of the best. I only knew a little about Russia's history, but was told that its history is one of backwardness, authoritarianism and mysticism. The person who told me was right. Russian history is just about on the opposite side of the spectrum from the U.S.'s. I found the characters believable but frustrating in their ignorance. Each era brought me new revelations about Russian history, especially the eras of Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great and the 1870's and 1880's with the pre-revolutionary nihilists.Mr. Rutherford is a wonderful writer and I look forward to reading his other novels. I'm recommending his books to all my friends and family."
4,Russia I never knew,"Typical fantastic Rutherfurd, intertwining fiction with fact. I learned alot about Russia I would never been aware of. A book you can't put down."
4,Long-winded but interesting,"Russka starts out great, and I got the feeling of vast space and dramatic history. But as it proceeds, there are many geographical descriptions and ponderous messages that get a little tedious. But I love the feeling of this big country, even though the cruelty, brutality and infighting somewhat depressed me. Am still reading it, in off moments. Personally, I like John Jakes better, as you can follow his characters with some excitement, caricatured as they may be. Rutherford's ""New York"" was a lot easier to read. Maybe I'm more of an American history buff, but one must broaden one's view."
1,difficult to use,"the screen isn't clear making it hard to see. also, directions for use are confusing - it doesn't seem intuitive."
3,Half-Handed Cloud-'Thy Is A Word&Feet Need Lamps'(Asthmatic),"'Thy Is A Word...' is their third effort.This Tennessee's band is perhaps best described as indie pop.Even though I usually like that genre,this CD I thought was so-so.Everything with Half-Handed seems to be handled if not led by main man multi-instrumentalist John Ringhofer.A couple of tracks I sort of liked were ""You Get A Horseshoe"",""Disaster Will Come"" and the Syd Barrett-ish ""Consider It A Loan"".Just might appeal to fans of Elf Power,American Flag and Olivia Tremor Control."
2,beware no bean bags,"I thought I was purchasing a bean bag game - as the title indicates - but I received 12 ping pong balls instead of bean bags. Beware - if you want a ""bean bag"" game - this isn't for you. Its also made of cardboard, which I guessed because of the price, however the stand is just two pieces of cardboard that are folded and held on with tape."
1,"Jamie & Nia, were times that hard?","This had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of Jamie Foxx and Nia Long is a diva, so I figured I couldn't lose on this movie. Boy, was I wrong, the whole plot was stupid, not to mention Jamie wasn't funny. The only kicks I got out of it were laughing with my girl about how stupid we were for renting it and picking it apart. C'mon now, how many sistas do you know would get in a truck full of rednecks in the middle of nowhere?"
2,Not too many laughs...,"This is a pretty silly movie. The idea of someone holding up a place at gunpoint, taking hostages, and the hostages eventually sympathizing and siding with the robber... well, it's been done before and much better. The talent of Nia Long is wasted in this movie. Most of her screen-time takes place at the very beginning and end of the film.I gave this an extra star simply because Jamie Foxx has some funny moments in this. He's a major talent and really deserves to do better films than this. He's a great actor, both comic and dramatic.The DVD features certainly don't make up for the poor quality of the film. Besides the film's trailer (and a few trailers for other Trimark films) the only feature is a four minute interview with Jamie Foxx."
3,Jamie Foxx is great fun in the lead role.,"After his impressive dramatic performance from Oliver Stone`s Any Given Sunday. The plot:Micheal(Foxx) and Rae(Nia Long) are vacation together thier destination is to go to Chicago. Since her girlfriend leave him in a unusual corner store. Then after his car is stolen by some punk kid. Then the worst came, when a small gang of robbers, are taking hostages in that corner store. But the good thing, the hostages are getting along with the robbers. The robbers are getting along the hostages also. Unusual premise upset by too much stupid moments or plot twist. But the film is entertaining enough to made this a plesent viewing. DVD Picture Quality is good and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround is impressive with some deep .1 lfe. Grade:B."
2,Waste of Talent!,"The only reason I rented this movie was because i knew Jamie Foxx could be hilarious, and Nia Long is such a great actress. So the movie has to be great, right? WRONG! This movie is just a low budget comedy that shouldnt have come out in the first place. How the heck do they get Jamie Foxx and Nia Long to star in such a ..movie? Although the movie ..was some funny stuff from Jamie Foxx, but not near as much as in the past. Nia Long's role was brief, and that was a disappointment. This movie was the opposite of what i was expecting, and thats not a good thing. Do yourself a favor and dont see this movie- its a plot that has been done a number of times before, but doesnt give many laughs.if this was helpful, click the icon below. thanks!"
2,Pretty Weak Film,"Fox could have did a lot better than choosing a role like this. His character was pretty lame, and this was an all around poor production and waste of good actor and actress talent (Nia Long)"
1,Get a big straw from the kitchen...,"because sucking is the only way one can take this movie! I love Jamie and find Nia to be such a ""lady"". But someone in Tinseltown other than Jamie was extremely anxious or needed Pamper money and threw this together. I wouldn't wish this crap on anyone. If you saw the trailer you saw ALL of the good scenes!"
3,Worst Packing job ever!,"This is probabally a great item, however I didn't even remove mine from the ""box"". As soon as I raised the lid and the sides fell to the ground, I couldn't help but notice the bowl was broken to pieces. There is no way anyone should expect this firepit to arive in one piece as the packaging is terrible. I can't believe Fed-Ex would even pick up a package this heavy in such poor packaging. This product was doomed for the trash before it left Amazon. I am sure it is a good product, but I wss so agravated, I really didn't care. To top it off, I was given a 2 month later shipping date for a replacement unit. I cancelled that new order and shopped elsewhere. I just hope I get my money back."
5,For the money? Can't be beat!,"We were nervous after reading a few reviews about it showing up broken and/or not working, but when we finally fired it up tonight, we were thrilled! It is cute, small so as to not take up a ton of your deck, and gives off some pretty good heat! We hope to find a propane tank small enough to fit inside it b/c as of now, have the hose running under the deck to the propane, which isn't a big deal, but would probably look more elegant if it stood alone. VERY VERY pleased at such a low price!"
1,arrived damaged,Ours arrived damaged. We didn't even remove the bubble wrap. It was poorly packed. It was wrapped in thin bubble wrap and placed in the box.
1,Fire Pit,Product inadequately packed to provide undamaged shipping. Returned first damaged fire pit and it was replaced by another damaged one. I do want to say that Amazon was great about the returns.
4,"Exciting, Refreshing & Intelligent","I spent (2) days reading this novel and I almost completed the book in (1) day. Just when I got to a stopping point I kept reading to satisfy inquiring mind. The reason I did not give it 5-Stars because I truly felt that Shay was a little to ""flaky"" that she actually ticked me off the way she kept accepting Ric's apologizes. She was such a intelligent woman I really believe if she had listented to her gut feelings . . .it would have told her that Woody was the man, and all the man she needed in her life. Thank you"
3,Surprising!!!,"Shay and Wood, in the beginning it was a relationship blooming and nicely developing. Shay and Ric what a love battlefield. I enjoyed this book of fiction as it is. Some people really do fall for the drama that a mate will dish to them.Shay, Wood and Ric were all in the same boat confused, they had issues. I must say this book was very entertaining it had it's flaws, but sometime what we think is love isn't and sometime we settle for less and do what we have to do. Shay was living through her romance writing and got stuck in the middle of it with Ric. Shay didn't know reality was until it hit her square in the face. Ric, on the other hand was doing what he knew was best for him. Woody, what can I say about him, just that I liked him. I didn't truly agree with his actions, however, he got what he wanted. It's always a great day to wake up and see reality for what it is for."
4,"Great Plot, Nice Story","I think that the book's plot is excellent and the story is nicely woven around that plot. However, I found some inconsistencies in the behaviour of the characters - I found it occassionally difficult to relate to their actions based on the image previously formed in my mind. I suspect that a slightly longer script filling in a few of the gaps (such as detailing more of the contact between Natasha and Woody earlier on) would have made it perfect for me.All in all however, it was quite a good read. Kept you interested from the start. Demonstrated some good insight on human character. I would recommend it."
2,not for dogs,"my bully ripped in half within 5 mins of unboxing,flimsy,cheap.funny watching doggy shred tho. guess i will look for something more durable."
2,NOT a dozen!,"The listing says 12-pack. What I received was ONE ""cheapo"" frisbee. The price paid just equals the value received [barely!]. It is not the savings as detailed / expected by the listing."
4,The unique can't be rated after a quick listen,"This is the second time a John Lee Hooker Jr. CD has me hooked - but it took a few listens. This ain't his father's blues, and deliberately so. John Lee Jr.'s lyric take, his mix of blues, jazz, Motown and R&B are no less than brilliant to me. It honestly took a dozen listens to grasp it all. That alone is worth the buy. Thinking man's music - for the masses. Yes, brilliant!"
2,"""Jr."" - Maybe, ""John Lee Hooker"" - NOT!","Amazon uses the word ""lackluster"" to describe one song on this on this CD, but it can be used to describe the entire CD. While Jr can sing, he sounds bored while singing these songs... somewhat like Tone Loc, heavily sedated, doing a bad John Lee Hooker impersonation. To his credit, Jr did try to make the genre his own, and not just be a young version of dad.However please keep in mind that, as a HUGE fan of John Lee Hooker, I may have just been expecting too much out of Jr."
3,A decent collection of songs.,"Naked Eyes released some pretty good material when they were together. There are plenty of songs on here to listen to. I'm not a big fan of this album, but there's no doubt that the songs are catchy. The singing and synths are also cool. The songs that I believe stand out are ""Promises, Promises (U.S. Version)"" and ""When the Lights Go Out."" The other greatest hits package from Naked Eyes doesn't have as many songs on it as this version does. These guys came out with some pretty good synth pop when they were around and this album is worth a listen."
1,The Book is Insanely Bad....Don't Even Buy It As A JOKE!,"This book should only be read if you are:a) A member of a mental institution b) As bored as I am c) Actually are French Harding or d) Want to give it to a nasty enemyI have never read a more unsatisfying book in my entire life, which actually consists of the last 2 minutes for I am a figment of some strange twisted person's imagination."
3,"Not bad but not in the same league as ""The Hungry Ocean""",Linda appears to be running short of material in this book.
4,good companion book,This book is a good companion book to Captain Greenlaws' other ocean-going tales. This book makes a bit more sense once the reader has read her other books first.
3,Solid symphonic metal from a distance,"Lushly orchestrated metal including all the operatic fixings guide this worthy introduction into some of the genres more accessible work. While Therion have certainly sounded fresher, the predictable songwriting still has it's moments of gothic splendor, punctuating their classical inspirations through the overproduced, mundane generalities. While lackluster rhythms tend to dominate, when this bands vision of unifying their metal and classical tendencies do come together it makes for a worthwhile excursion."
4,Concluding the 'Dragon'trilogy...,"Sweden's Therion comprise Christopher Johnsson on guitars,Kristian Niemann-guitars,Sami Karpinen-drums,and Johan Niemann on bass.Their approach to metal,even though follows the recent trend of mixing orchestral passages with standard metal fare is unique:they actually use full orchestras,choirs,and do away with traditional vocals creating intense mythical,romantic,and ultimately stunning sonic landscapes,as this 1997 effort testifies.'Vovin'is a very welcome breath of fresh air for the genre."
5,STUNNING!![...],"This is the first album i've ever bought of Therion, and it just amazed me! It is so brilliantly composed. The orchestra just goes perfectly with the guitar work. Therion does have progressive metal in them but darker. The orchestra, choir, keyboards just sound great. The guitars just sound so good. This album is just incredible. If you liked this one a lot, check out Deggial.I really like the direction Therion is going in, i can tell Johnson has some Mozart, Beethoven influence.I also recommened Theli. GET THIS ALBUM!![...]"
4,Enjoyable,"This is Therions top selling album. Not because it's the best either. But because it is something that just about anyone can listen to. The songs get stuck in your head very easily.The lyrics are much weaker than the new albums, also the music is much simpler and the playing is not as impressive. But the songs are haunting, and relaxing to a point.You have basic Gothic Metal (not very metal-like more of a relaxing type rock) style playing with haunting female vocals singing about religion and the occult.I get bored with this album rather quickly but it its something that you could play around other people and I doubt few people would have any objections listening to it."
5,It blew my mind away...!,"I am what you could call a metalhead... i know a lot about the whole underground metal scene and I must say, this is my favorite band in this genre. Although, in my opinion, it is not as good as the previous album, Theli, it still is excellent and worth the money. The mixing of an orchestra, a choir and powerful progressif metal guitars is amazing...!!! I highly recommend this album and all the other albums as well, although their earlier work is much different than the last two... buy it and enjoy...!! =o)"
5,excellent combination between gothic and rock music,I just bought this CD recently and I must say it is one of my best buys. the combination between gothic middleaged music combined with heavy rock is absolutly fantastic.
2,What?!,"What is this?! This is a band poor in vocals, poor in music and poor in talent. I Listened first to Crowning of Atlantis and I can rate it 4 stars, but trust me, I will never, EVER listen to another cd. If you want to see what this band is, be my guest and buy Crowning of Atlantis but NO MORE."
2,Not good,"Stock standard heavy metal blended with repetitive and uninspired classical music does not make a good album in my opinion. If you want some metal with classical(among other things) influences check out HOLLENTHON, they don't really sound like THERION, but thats a good thing."
1,"What is this cd, they have got to be kidding right?",this band needs to fined a direction and sorry dudes!! but there are not theatre of tradegy and never will be thank god for that! what disgrace to metal!!!
4,A Long-time friend & fans Pro's & Con's,"Bobby I pray you read the following review: Being a personal friend of Mr. Womack's for the past 26-Years, I sincerly admit I am truly prejudice. All in all this 2-CD set of Bobby's early work is truly outstanding. However, I agree with the individual's review from Schenetady, N.Y. ""Where was Daylight""?"
4,Good,"If youre going to buy paintballs, PLEASE make sure you size your bore. Otherwise, with the people above, you will not realize that these balls are meant for larger bores, like the .691 - .693 bore sizes. This is LARGE BORE PAINT. If you have a gun with a small bore, like the Proto/Dye guns, these will break. These will work with large bores like Tippmann. Get a micrometer and size your bores before you buy your paint!!"
4,Outstanding Quality,"It is a very good quality paintball. It is much more accurate and hi-quality than GI sports or Draxxus basic training, both of which I have used and not been fond of. It is brittle enough to break, but durable enough to withstand some rough mechanical markers. If you want a good quality paintballs that will shoot straight and turn your opponent pretty colors, go with the premium."
1,PMI RPS Premium Paintball (Yellow/Blue): Expensive yet popped almost every other ball,"after reading other reviews, I used .690 flasc barrel on my phenom which had a Tech T bad karma bolt(soft tip). Almost every other ball popped inside the barrel. Even after cleaning it, then had to switch to a different barrel, they still popped like popcorn. I thought it was my gun so i used the paint sold there, not a single problem. Maybe it was my gun but I doubt that."
3,Premium Paintballs,"Not so good for shooting them in a Proto SLG, Proto SLG UL, or Tippman 98 in my opinion. I had to many to count bust in the barrel. Go for the RPS stingers instead."
2,No es el mejor,"Este no es el mejor de los discos del fary. Tiene una producción un tanto descuidada, las orquestaciones no son demasiado buenas, hay mucho midi, y los temas, bueno, están bien, pero...Yo solo se lo recomendaría a incondicionales del Fary.Si estás buscando algo de el fary y no sabes que disco buscar, este, simplemente no es el mejor. Mira otros como ""calle calvario"", ""casta y figura"" o ""sin trampa ni carton""."
2,Treasure Quest,I bought Treasure Quest for my grandson's 13th birthday. He mastered it very quickly. The idea is great but it's clearly for younger children.
2,Would not recommend,I purchased two stands for a musical production I recently performed in; one for my violin and one for my mandolin. I used this stand for my mandolin and twice on stage during performance it tipped - my mandolin crashing to the ground. Luckily no permanent damage was sustained to the instrument. I spent a little bit more money on one for my violin (thankfully!) and I experienced no problems at all. This product could be better designed.
1,THE REAL TRUTH,"DON OMAR IS AN EXECELENT COMPOSER AND ARTIST BUT IN THIS CD HE MESSED UP. IN REALITY THERE ARE ONLY LIKE 4 SONGS THAT ARE GOOD THE REST WIERD AND STUPID. DADDY YANKEE WILL BE COMING OUT AT THE END OF THIS YEAR WITH EL CARTEL 3, LETS SEE WHAT MR YANKEE WILL BRING. DON U F*%$#% UP ON THIS ONE, BETTER MAKE IT UP!"
2,Could of done better,"Well what can I say, I'm a Don Omar fan but this album just didn't cut it. The beats were not up to the standard that we are all used to. The song writing was not his best by far. If your a Don Omar fan like me you should buy it for your collection, but don't expect to much."
1,what gives?,Hey what's up with this...it's all in spanish. What's the matter don omar no habla the ingles?
5,"Amateurs take notes, this is how the KING OF KINGS does it!","Until I hear Tego and Daddy Yankee's latest, this is the best new reggeaton out there. DON'T HATE...APPRECIATE!Don Omar doesn't disappoint with KING OF KINGS he has a little bit of everything for everyone. What I like about the cd is how he likes to break new ground with 'Cuetale' sounds like a hybrid of Bachata and Reggaeton. 'Predica' lets you know that William Landron also is a preacher man. 'Conteo' w/ Juelz Santana is straight up hip hop. 'Munecas De Porcelana' is a great story. LIGHT UP, DRINK UP AND LISTEN TO DON OMAR'S LATEST CLASSIC.These hitz hit hard:1) Predica2) Reportense3) Ojitos Chiquitos4) Conteo w/ Juelz Santana7) Candela8) Salio El Sol9) En Su Nota w/ Mackie Ranks10) Angelito13) Infieles14) Belly Danza w/Beenie Man15) Munecas De Porcelana - nice song to f*** to.16) Not Too Much w/Zion"
4,Good album,"This album has a great combination to it.And he proof that he can also sing,such song as ""tu no sabes"".This album happened to me as it did with Daddy Yankee's cd when it first came out..i was finding myself forcing to like the album.This is what happened to me with this album..is a album u have to get use to and once u do..it gets better each time.Eliel helped with a lot of tracks which helped a lot cause of his great talent ...overall its good...could've been better.maybe."
4,King of kings,Don Omar in this album didn't follow the same reggaeton routine or rules. He made his own rules and does something very different from everyone else. From start to finish keeps you wondering what will he do next. Groundbreaking!!!
5,Aint nothing wrong with different Reggaeton beats.,First of all this Album is fire!!! Is the only Reggaeton album worth buying right now. With different beats which is a HIGH DEMAND in Reggaeton and deep songs like Angelito Theres no denying. Im not a daddy yankee hater But Compare to Don omar and Tego hes no competition.One of these two shouldve blown up before him. Even Voltio is better than him. All around album 5 stars but as reggaeton 4.Is about Talent Not looks Peoples. Don omar the new era.
2,Get Off Your High Horse!!!!!,"Man this kid used to be good, now he's so full of himself, some one better burst his BIG head!!!! Come back down to earth man!!!!! Remember the higher you get, the harder the fall is going to be."
5,Not bad at all,"I only know some of the songs, and previewed the album a few times, but what I've heard is good. It's not your standard, cookie cutter reggaeton with the same drums doing the same damn rhythm throughout the WHOLE album, which is a GREAT idea. Don Omar is probably the most unique ""reggaeton"" artists out there, and thank God he's around or the genre might be completely dead in the water....OK and I needed to bring up the ratings for this album because of the retard who gave it 1 star because it's all in Spanish lol""DONNN!!!"""
3,eh,"I love Reggaeton and certainly Don Omar is a widely recognized Reggaeton artist with some excellent songs, but I am not quite feeling this album.Some of the harder rap songs are good, but the man should really not push the singing so much. I don't know if I'm the only one, but I am going to kill myself if I hear Angelito one more time."
5,One Hot Album,"King of King's by Don Omar is one hot album. As much as I love the standard reggaeton beats, Don's album has branched out into the ""new"" sound of reggaeton. The production on this ablum is off the hook. I also love the fact that he has done collabos with Beenie Man and Juelz Santana. Don's lyrics stay sharp and tight as the beats enhance the dedication to his craft! This is a man that means buisness and this is heard in his voice!"
5,The CD that reaggeton needed,"I feel this is what the genre needs. Don Omar really has set the bar high ""musically"". I really like where he is going and I commend him for it. Remember what happened to the Panama reaggeton movement? It never evolved and the P.R movement killed it. So Don Omar has done just what the genre needs. Not many artist can get away with the revolution of reaggeton wich you will be witness once you purchase this CD. But William Landron Omar is worthy and talented enough to pull it off. Not even the great Daddy Yankee could have pulled this off. Thank you Don for a great CD... can't wait to see the next few albums that come out this year (tego) (yankee) and see how quickly your influence shows..."
5,Awesome cd,"I think this is the best of Don Omar cds ever. I was actually looking for the last one, where Taboo and Danza Kuduro are, but those two are the only good songs in it, so I got ""King of Kings"". I love every single song in this one. If you like reggeaton, this is the one."
2,A Sample Of Reggaeton's Dead End is in sight,"Apart from ""Sale el Sol"" and a few others, this album is such a pack of busted latin hop clichés that it's hard not to laugh while listening to it. Don Omar wants to be a singer, but his limited style really grinds, and the incessant repeats of ""King Of Kings"" truly gets tired after the third ""song"". Real musicians were not harmed in the making of this album, apart from violinist Miri Ben-Ari, and it shows. No true producers are involved in the next stage of reggaeton, and this will truly drive the genre into the ground before it has really landed internationally. And don't expect much from Yankee's next release...he even has less depth than Omar."
3,King of Kings,Look on da realz Im a avid listener to reggaeton and ive heard this album 5 times ova to get da feal of the album and the lyrics. In my Opinion Don Omar is da best but he gave this album with new approaches and im really not feeling them. Its a good album nonetheless and their are some tracks u could get down to but reggaeton with Daddy Yankee and Don Omar has Changed significantly and the flair that these 2 guys use to have has been winding down. Don Omar could have most definately done betta on this album...he needs to get back down to gettin the parties pumpin. For me their arent really to much party jumpin tracks. I had the album wen it first came out and after two weeks i had to retire it from car....Imma stick to his old tracks and some of the otha Pioneers of reggaeton.Daddy Yankee....I dont kno wat else to say about him he need a serious change or Don omar might as well be crowned KING OF KINGS FOREVA
4,"Great product, obscene shipping costs.","Call me petty, but i'm chopping a star off this just due to the sticker shock that comes when you view the shipping cost on these. I was an idiot and just clicked 'place order' when I saw the price without looking.Then I see a $36 product with a $17 shipping cost once the receipt comes with the order.I suppose they could justify that by considering the gift crate part of the shipping cost, but I thought that was already in the price.I didn't learn my lesson though, I loved these chocolates and so I ordered a few more to give as gifts. At least the shipping prices start going up less around the $80-100 mark.Now, as to the product? Yum. There's like 6 or 7 brands of booze represented on each side, and about 10+ little chocolates lined up horizontally in a row of each flavor.It's extremely tasty. Perfect pickup any time you want something sweet... and they make a nice gift. Just be prepared for the shipping charges."
3,Yum Yum,"These were very good, much like the kind I have purchased from Swiss Colony in the past. I would have said excellent, but when in Fredericksburg 3 years ago, I found a chocolatier who did them by hand with some luxurious chocolate, so it kinda has dampened my opinion of mass produced liquor filled chocolate. But these are very good."
1,"avoid the chocolate, the wrapper tastes better!!!!",Even bootleggers would avoid these! Absolutely horrible. Don't buy the crate unless you run out of firewood.
5,Outstanding Book!,This was another good book featuring our hero Kirk McGarvey. This book brought about the introduction of the KGB killing machine Arkady Kurshin. Coupled with McGarvey's other nemesis Baranov this pair was extremely deadly. McGarvey stays in a dead run trying to prevent the Russians from launching first a Pershing missile and then a Tomahawk missile. This book gives you any type of action scenario that you could ask for. McGarvey and Kurshin battle each other in the sea and on dry land. Baranov is of couse trying to depose Gorbachev. This book is action packed with an excellent plot as well as outstanding characters. This is another great book from Hagberg.
4,One of the better Kirk McGarvey novels,"David Hagberg is always intriguing, especially his Kirk McGarvey series, and Countdown is one of the better books in the series. The story is consistently compelling, taking the action from one great location to another. The tension is superbly timed, and like any great spy story, the hero is not invincible so you always feel he really is in danger. His main adversary is dangerous and cunning, building to a strong mano-a-mano encounter. Hagberg's roots as a writer of submarine-based military fiction sees some application, but I thought the submarine scenes in the book could have been a little more dramatic. Still, that's not really a complaint, just an observation. This is an excellent spy thriller, with plenty of action throughout."
1,CD was NOT functional.,"As a practicing physician, I was very pleased with the content of this Book. It was informative and very helpful. I have several OTHER clinical books by ""Mosby"" and was in NO WAY displeased with the Book's content. HOWEVER, this is where my evaluation of this ""Book/CD combo"" departs from an otherwise SATISFACTORY review. The accompanying ""mini-disc"" WAS FAULTY. I can say that with absolute certainty because.. the Introduction and First Section WOULD PLAY quite well. The remainder and vast majority of the material would only make an ""indistinguishable mumbling noise."" The customer relations department at AMAZON obviously agreed with my assessment and quickly refunded my cost. What more could you ask of a company? Because of Amazon's ""customer-friendly"" policy concerning returns, I will continue to shop with them.. with Confidence."
2,It Could Have Been Better,"Shirley Bassey was voted the best female vocalist in the last 50 years, and most of her recordings reflect that. However, this CD is the exception. I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but every song seems to be a struggle for her, and knowing Bassey, there was no reason to struggle! The only song on this CD that she manages to give the ""Bassey treatment"" to is ""As If We Never Said Goodbye"", and even it could have been better. The rest are hard to listen to. I love the picture on the cover though."
1,"Never, never, never!","I was so excited to hear these interpretations of Andrew Lloyd Webber standards, but this is such a horrible attempt. Her belting is just so out of place in this particular recording. So sorry, Shirley. Terrific picture on the cover, though, and ""Macavity"" and ""The Last Man in My Life"" are the only cuts that are not that bad. I suggest for musical afficionados to definitely ignore this major disappointment."
5,Perfect Paper for Photo Album Creation,"I bought this paper to create pages for a photo album. I am using a Canon i9900 photo printer and am quite experienced with this printer. First off, I was a bit disappointed with the paper at first, which is ""Semi-gloss"" or ""Luster"". The item photo shows ""glossy plus"" but when I checked after receiving the item in the mail, I also noticed that the above photo said ""4x6""...However, after using the paper, I am completely converted. The photos and text came out crisp and colorful. The photos look every bit as good as those I've printed on ""Photo Paper Plus Glossy"" or ""Photo Paper Pro"". I was a bit worried about flipping the paper over and printing on the second side, but there were no issues with smudging or streaking. Also, drying double-sided paper can be finicky, but with the included drying ""racks"" and clear instructions, all went well. Like all Canon paper that I have used, I am really happy with the results. (My box had all 10 sheets, by the way...)"
1,Cannon Photo Paper,"This was to be a rushed order for printing pictures for the holidays. I ordered off the internet since no stores that I found in the area seemed to stock double sided picture paper. I purchased the paper and paid the extra $$$$$$$$ to have it shipped immediately, so I would receive it in 3 to 4 days. On the day I expected the paper to land on my doorstep I received an email saying it was being shipped that day. Needless to say, I paid $25 (15 in shipping) for a few sheets of paper that never arrived on time so they were totally worthless to me. I wrote the company asking for an adjustment in the cost of the shipping but never received a response. If the ad would have been honest and more descriptive of the ""rush delivery"", I never would have taken the chance. I was ripped off.bb"
4,Why is this going unnoticed?,"Solid album featuring the duo of Craig G and Will Pack. Yes, THAT Craig G, the Juice Crew member and Freestyle legend. This went totally under the radar and got mentioned nowhere, and it deserves better. Pick it up"
1,Poor service.,The Carper 318 will not open my gate. I called and aaaremotes gave me a return number. They said a different model would work: Carper 318T. I returned the two that I had in exchange for the Carper 318T. I haven't received my return shipment for Carper 318T. I called aaaremotes to inquire about my return shipment but my calls haven't been returned.
5,"Out of Print, but worth the search!","It took me 8 years to find this book, but I finally succeeded. This is undoubtedly some of Simon & Kirby's best work. Fast paced, these stories easily stand up with the best comics of any era. Marvel should really reprint this or at least put it out as a trade paperback. It you like westerns or boy adventure stories don't miss this book."
4,Solid presentation,"Gower's survey begins with Galileo and ends with Carnap. In between, he covers a number of prominent scientists - the ones you expect, like Bacon and Newton; and a few you don't, like John Maynard Keynes. He has grouped his subjects according to the nature of their contribution, which means that this reads as the series of essays that it is. Each essay is separately referenced.There are a few odd omissions, like Descartes (who is nonethless mentioned in passing). But the net result is that, instead of being presented with the historical panorama, one is confronted with a series of ideas - and how they fit into the overall understanding of contemporaries."
1,Not so good,"I bought this as a holiday gift for a friend in 2006. She's not overly picky about her coffee, and she LOVES Cocolate Mint flavored coffee, but in 2007 right before Christmas she let me know it wasn't very good and to PLEASE not purchase more for her because it didn't taste good. :("
2,"Hitler Bad, Vandals Suck!","Ok, the lyrics are catchy, and I like them, like, a lot. But man, they can't write tunes worth a shit! For good punk crap buy NOFX. They're cool. Punk in Drublic rocks unlilke SOME bands' CDs."
2,"THis CD BAD, other cds good","THe vandals were trying to be funny in this one, and they are, but it gets on your nerves. Get a different vandals cd"
2,REALLY OLD REALLY FAST,"First listening to this CD its sound great, but the songs get really old really fast. None of the songs are really good. The Vandals are a very potential band, and they have proven their skillz in both music and lyrics in their preivous CD's, DONT BUY UNLESS YOUR A REAL VANDALS FAN, OR YOU GET THE CD FOR LIKE $5."
4,"Hitler was a bad guy, Vandals are ok guys","I'm surprised how good this album is every song is awesome and if you've ever seen the ""My girlfirend's dead"" video it's hilarious. The Vandals might be the poor man's NOFX to some people except they don't really have that many political songs any more and Nofx still nudges some social/political songs into their records. The vandals are pure fun and great old school pop-punk. Best songs:""I know huh"", ""cafe 405"", ""an idea for a movie"", and ""eurobarge""."
2,Doesnt hold up...,"At first this cd seemed great...but after a few times through the songs just got old. It just left you feeling bored and sick...it's not worth it folks, there's better punk stuff out there."
2,Thumbs Down,"Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of great songs on here, especially that cover of the Pennywise song, Com Out Fighting, but, come on, these guys have lost a little bit of their punk edge; they're not the hardcore phreaks of When In Rome..."
4,COME OUT FIGHTING? PENNYWISE?,Come out Fighting is on Pennywise self titled in 91. did the vandals cover it?
3,"""Love kills"" keeps you in suspense!","I enjoyed this film because of the interesting cast of characters, and constant plot twists. If you have ever played the game ""Clue"" and enjoy ""who done it"" mysteries, then you will enjoy this film. However, often times the attempts at crude humor can be a turn off. I still would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie."
1,don't waste your money,"dont waste your money on this nearly worthless item. also dont buy the main unit either. you will spend lots of time fixing, wondering, wasting seed, getting everything wet, and generally having a difficult time. and dont count on the company to be of any help. stay away from this one."
5,Best book of it's kind I have found!,"I have several books on outdoor lore and I was hopeful after having read the previous reviews that this would make a good addition to my library. This book outshines them all! It is very comprehensive and detailed, and a pleasure to read. If you have an interest in outdoor survival I urge you to purchase this book."
4,Outdoor handbook,I first read this book in my High School Library in 1955.The best outdoor survival book ever.Buy it at least a month before you go camping.Must read for campers.
4,Wildwood Wisdom,"The book is like-let's say-first survival guide but with the knowledge and respect from what nature provide us.If you believe that respecting nature and that means you respect all the leaving beings,then i think that this book is suitable for you."
4,3.5 stars,"Sticking to the old school creed of ""kick but, take names, move on to next town, repeat"", DIES IRAE falls under that rather small umbrella of death metal bands who can translate the intensity of their live shows onto those shiny silver platters we all know and love. None of that hand me down sorrow crap either, this is pure confidence, adrenaline, a primal need to inject some poison into the vains of society. These are men who won't be able to live past fifty. Won't be able to slow down long enough to survive that bruising roll down the other side of the hill. And that's just what strikes a chord with the post-Townshend youth who hope to hell they die before they get old enough to empty their own bedpans. That's precisely what mosh pits were invented for- to weed out the weak- and the weak need certainly not apply here."
4,The Back to Mine Series...,"If you aren't familiar with the Back to Mine Series by now, your missing out on some great insights into the bands who put them together. I've been a New Order Fan since Power Corruption and Lies, and I'm fascinated by the music that drove the creative juices in the early days and appealed to the band members throughout their evolution. Some fans may well remember when New Order sounded very much like little more than a bunch of Cassio keyboards and Drum Machines themselves. If your interested in the music that inspires your favorite musicians then check it out. You might find something unexpectedly enjoyable... You may also start to notice things about New Order's music after hearing what they like to listen to... All of the Back to Mine CDs have been very enlightening."
4,It's not New Order - but it is brilliant.,"The entire Back to Mine series are excellent compilations chosen by interesting artists. This one is no different - it's a brilliant mix of songs, not just a mishmash of Kruder remixes and Morcheeba knock-offs. Each track is there for a reason - because it sounds good."
3,Tension-inducing,"If I had an invitation from New Order to go ""back to mine"", I'd have to decline. I've loved the Back to Mine series so far for its warm, sweet tunes (especially Everything But the Girl's contribution). This is a departure from that mood, which may be welcomed by some fans but not by this one. The songs on this cd are painfully self-conscious, dark and moody, reminding me of a cynical friend who's intelligent and creative but also unpleasant to be around. Even ""I Feel Love"" goes to the dark side on this compilation. There are lots of people, I'm sure, who appreciate this sort of sound, but for those looking for a good wind-down and relax mix, this isn't the place to find it."
1,terrible: f,"the worst of the back to mine series, period. and i LOVE the series. bad to the point where i wonder if it was a joke. does no justice to the otherwise fantastic back to mine compilations."
1,"don't come ""back to mine"" with this!!","i must admit i'm disappointed by this one...yes, from looking at the track listings i expected something a little eclectic...but this is just plain disjointed and absurd. ""back to mine"" collections have been interesting enough in the past, sometimes bordering on tedious because it sticks with the formula, but this definetly redefines what one may call ""after-hours"" music. its not really. and its not as interesting as a band that started from the dark roots of joy division and played a major role in defining electronic pop of the late 80's and early 90's. i'd save the money, unless you're into the absurd."
1,Lame Concept,"Don't get me wrong, I'm probably the biggest New Order fan of anyone I know. You can imagine my delight when I saw this CD thinking it was a new release or something obscure by the band.It took me reading other review comments before I understoond that this is just other peoples music New Order likes. REALLY NOW! Have we stooped so low that this is the vehicle in which to sell CDs. Using New Orders name to create a CD that has nothing to do with their music.... Shameful. Even the reviews of the CD are ambiquious to that fact. Who needs this ..."
1,The worst entry in the otherwise fantastic BTM series,"What a massive let down! I love New Order and the Back To Mine series has always been a treat for adventurous ears. After a glowing review in Q, I bought this. Unfortunately it ...., it's completely annoying conglomeration of grating avant-garde garbage. Stick with the Orbital, Faithless or Groove Armada (the best) examples of the series. A must to avoid."
1,NOT by New Order the group.,Careful when ordering this album. It is not by New Order the group. It is a collections of songs collected with the co-operation of New Order. If you like the typical New Order stuff - this is not it.
4,His best from the Capitol years.,"Freddie Jackson was undoubtedly one of the most important and influential male R&B vocalists of the 1980s and '90s. ""Tasty Love"", ""You Are My Lady"", ""Do Me Again"", ""Hey Lover"" and ""Nice N' Slow"" are classic ballads in every way. Unfortunately, some of his best songs were never issued as singles and are not included here. This IS a great collection but it's not as comprehensive as his 2-CD set anthology."
4,good disc,most of the material here is first rate.You are My Lady is still tight.so is Rock me tonight.the words&music work well thru out here.Freddie Jackson really sings strong on the two aboved mentioned songs.this disc is a must.
4,Very Pleased,I've had this TV for over a year and am still pleased with my purchase. DVD's look amazing on it even with simple AV cables. The speakers (only 4w a piece) leave a little to be desired but after hooking my stereo up to it I've had no other issues. HD broadcasts look pretty good on it but some standard broadcasts look a littly grainy. I have Comcast digital cable by the way. I researched this set in Consumer Reports and it was listed as one of their best buys. It's just about the right size for a small living room or a bedroom. I think I'll keep it.
3,Don't buy TV from OneCall!!!,"This is a pretty good TV, my friend has one. I purchased this tv and have had nothing but problems getting the TV to me. They gave me a big run a round and wanted to charge me an extra $100 for shipping. (...) Amazon.com has nothing to do with it because they are a seperate seller. And on top of this, i never even received the TV!! They said i would need to pay another $100 to ship it back to me. Would never buy from them again."
5,great for little cooks,"I ordered this for a three year-old. She absolutely loves it; the stovetop, microwave and sink get the most use. It's taller than some other play kitchens, so I would expect it to work well for older kids too. It was fairly easy to put together, it took about 90 minutes (no missing parts, but there were a few places the directions didn't match up perfectly with the parts we had, I think the directions were for a prior version). The quality is fine; it's sturdy enough and easy for kids to use. This seemed to me to be the nicest of the Kidkraft kitchen models; except for the color, it's identical to the primary color island kitchen. When comparing prices on the web, watch the shipping cost; it varies widely between sellers."
1,its better to watch paint dry,i put this book down at least 3 times.. i couldnt even force myself to sit down and read it.. I kept it b/c my gf bought it for me but omg it was worse than watching paint dry. You cant always trust b/c zane endorses something that you should buy it
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I know it may be unfair for me to write a review on a book that I have not finished.However,I really believe its impossible for anyone to finish this book.I have had this book for well over a month and I have not finished it yet.This is one of the worst books I have ever read."
3,Different,"This book was different. I applaud the leading lady for being strong and taking matters in her own hands. I originally thought the ending could have been better. However, after thinking about it. It could not have ended in a better way. Enjoy the book everyone!!"
1,Wasted my time,"Talk about a disappointment. The title really had my attention. The first chapter I was so excited. But it went downhill. To be honest, to me it was kind of boring. I only finished it because I wanted to know how it would end and that was disappointing!!!! If the book had of ended without leaving me hanging, I may could have given it 2 stars but I hate I wasted time giving it a chance. One star!"
2,NOT!!!!,"I had high expectations for this book once I read chapter 1. I was totally disappointed!! This book was the exact same throughout the whole 400 pages. There were so many different directions the author could have went with this story to make it more interesting. Brandi was really over the top, Tonya was stupid and Vernon was really stupid! It really didnt take 400 pages to wrap this boring story up. Should have been a short story!"
2,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"Definitely not what I was anticipating, quite boring, I was only reading to get the juiciness of the story, which turned out to be none. I could have done a better job where my imagination was going regarding the book and the title. Very disappointing."
1,I wouldn't recommend,"I still haven't finished reading and I've been trying to get through the book for over a month. So many things just don't make sense in the beginning of the book. Even though it's fiction, it should still have some believability. Tell me, what woman befriends her husband's mistress immediately after finding out of his affair. And what wife lets the mistress have the car and diamond ring? Especially a sistah."
2,Disappointed,"I just finished reading this book by Kai and I'm a bit disappointed. I had high hopes about this book with it being a part of Strebor Books (ZANE) and the title really caught my attention. Plus, I thought it would be cool to read a different storyline from all the similar ones saturating the market right now. I really don't mind if it seemed realistic or not as long as it's an interesting read. My first problem with it is it seemed to really drag on. Everytime I picked the book up I got sleepy. Now, don't get me wrong, the opening was an attention-grabber but the after the first few chapters it went downhill from there. I've read books in one day that really did make me not want to put them down and this wasn't one of them. Then, it was a bit choppy. The constant flashbacks, that were recalled in pieces - I assume to keep you guessing about what was to happen next, were a bit much. I pretty much forced myself to finish it since I'd already started it but it's definitely not a favorite."
3,Oh well!,This book was very slow and took me a while to get into.I wouldnt buy it so your best bet would be to pick it up from the library!
3,A LITTLE DRY,This book was not i expected. It was drawn out and at times boring. The story line was dry. There's a few chuckles here and there but the only reason i finished is because I really wanted to see want was going to happen in the end. Which wasn't all what i expected.
4,pleased,I enjoyed this book and I was glad that I was able to purchase this product at a reasonable price
3,Something Different,I think the book was just ok. The plot was good and the story line was good but I think it was poorly written. Some parts seemed to just drag on and some things seemed to be very unnessecary. The idea was a good one and it was very different so thats a plus.
1,a striptease with no skin,"The dvd shows amazing snippets from various live recorded shows,why not at least relase a full concert or two on a dvd,I just am seething with anger knowing such footage exists but amunalble to even hear a single song played thru.as for best hits, its all good so no need for such a cd."
5,Great,An Anthology of Mr. Vollenweider's very unique music. Even the live tracks (at the end) are unique and beautiful! That can be fairly rare for New Age artists....
5,A great read,"This quintessential New England poet brings the same solid ear, wry humor, keen historical sense, and sharp eye for natural and social detail to every poem. He is one of our zestiest poets of things-as-they-are, happily allergic to obscurity, pretension, and gauzy abstraction. Every poem is *placed*: firmly located in time and space, naturally, but also placed with utmost care on the page. His sinewy free verse is given flexibility by his great control of syntax and his diction, as always, is capacious and thickly textured. Calling a poet ""readable"" these days might seem like damnation with faint praise, but to my mind we need a lot more poetry which combines accessibility, good humor, and intelligence as skillfully as Galvin always does. This collection is both meaty and enjoyable: a great read."
5,Nice,"Fits well, affordable, does what I need to too to keep safe when I ride. I have no complaints this was a good purchase"
1,Incorrect standard rating claims,"The helmet is not ECE 22.05 rated. This helmet is DOT only.Just thought I'd clear up some misinformation, please check the AFX website and fix your description."
3,lackluster,"I have to humbly disagree with the hyperbolic enthusiasm of the review below; though there are some things to commend in Paschen's book, the concepts are far better than their execution. I love the idea of having a multivocal array of experiences, settings and forms to convey different narratives about love and desire. However, Paschen didn't (at least when the book was published in 1996) have the skill to pull this off. The voices of wildly different women not only all sound the same, but they all speak in slack, unmusical language, and tell stories bogged down unnecessary detail. The poems lack surprise and variation, despite Paschen's attempt to patchwork a variety of characters together. This is a very forgettable reading experience."
3,Lacks the heart of the originals,"I have to disagree with the other reviews. Yes, there are some great songs on this CD collection. But the bands are way past their prime, and they seem to be going through the motions on these re-recordings. I also find that the sound of the original recordings, available elsewhere, while not in stereo, seem to reflect the era much better. These are a bit too sanitized for my taste.My recommendation....pick up original recordings by these bands from when they were in their prime, and skip this."
2,Globe Trekker - Peru :[,Not enough emphasis on the positive side of Peru. Macchu Picchu was about a one minute segment. Some shots were nice but not worth the money ! Sorry I wasted it on this DVD !
2,dumb,stupid movie...did not care for it at all..poorly done..i hear its a cult classic and don't understand the attraction at all
3,Fun movie... i like it,"Bunch of silly cavemen trying to learn about life and survival and eventuallyfind a women with a tail.... Problem is...no man knows what to do with a women.The movie is so stupid, that its funny...i would recommend this movie."
2,No taste nor smell of coffee here!,"This lip balm is labeled as ""Coffee Roast"" but smells nothing like coffee and has no scent of coffee, either. Not much of a pleasant taste at all, just sort of cocoa butter, and slightly gooey in feel. Not impressed at all, but may be good for your lips. *shrug* Just don't expect it to actually be what it advertises as to fragrance or taste. Not worth the extra cost for a very bland product."
5,G.Bednar,"If you don't have one you need one. they are quick and easy, the only thing they need is to sell one with longer rope (18 ft.)"
5,great invention,I have larger versions of this they've worked great for everything that I've used them for.
1,New View of Sacraments Limmited,"Bausch's ""A New Look at the Sacraments"" offers some valuable insights into our ideas of what the Sacraments mean, however, Bausch also claims that the traditional understandings of the Sacraments are incorrect, and offers his theories as an alternative, rather than an addendum. Bausch takes some good ideas, and applies them horribly by offering a limmited view of the meaning of the Sacraments. Bausche's theories when viewed as an alternative to a more traditional understanding of the sacraments denies the idea of the Sacraments having any understanding as facilitating a personal relationship w/ Christ. He sees the Sacraments purely as a community thing. A community understanding of the Sacraments is good, and this book helps a person to deepen their understanding of what the Sacraments are, but to say that this understanding is the only true understanding of the Sacraments is wrong."
2,Refund for 2 day shipping,"I paid extra to have the item shipped in 2 days. The item was ordered Monday,October 8 at 9am and nearly $50 was added as a 2 day shipping fee. I expected the item on Wednesday October 10. Since I will not get this order in the two days as requested, I demand a full refund of the shipping fee. Why do you offer a 2 day shipping if you have no intention of honoring this request? My item has taken two days to prepare for shipment. I am completely dissatisfied!"
4,"Not an Altar Missal, but a valuable Resource","""Prayers of the Eucharist"" is a magnificant work, much like the book ""Ordination Rites of the Ancient Churches of East and West"", intended for use, not at the Altar, but in the study of the clergy and those most intimately connected with preparing worship and teaching liturgical history.This book provides eucharistic prayers that date from the 1st Century (Didachae, Addi and Mari, etc) through the patristic era (including Hippolytus, primitive forms of Basil from Egypt) and right through the middle ages and into the reformation era. This book stops short of the Second Vatican Council and the modern Liturgical Renewal, but does include valuable material from Lutheran, Anglican, and Reformed Liturgies.If one is to be equipped to carefully craft the future of Christian Eucharistic Prayer, one must find their roots of expression and theology in the past.This book will equip the liturgist to do just that."
5,Great recipes,"Dave Anderson has taken the time to give his insight into the history of Famous Dave's. It makes for some interesting reading, but the real gem of this book is the recipes. The bread pudding is sinful. You have to make it at least once in your life."
5,good book,Received this book in good shape and on time. Now I can hopefully compete with famous daves and make bbq at home.
5,"""A Superb Addition to Anyone's Kitchen""","Dave has definitely outdone himself this time. What a fascinating trip to parts of the country most of us have never seen. Fun-lovin' stories about Dave and others ... makes you feel like you've known ""Uncle Dave"" all your life. Brilliant photographs and neat stories ... Backroads and Sidestreets is on my Christmas list for everyone this year ... should be on yours, too!"
2,It's A Living,"An oddly disapointing album, PAUL IS LIVE sounds good enough, but is emotionally unsatisfying.The performances are OK, but it feels as if a group of studio musicians are just running through a nights work. Oops--here's why--that's exactly what PAUL IS LIVE is!Macca has some trouble with the high notes, so you spend way too much time listening to Hamish Stuart's vocals. Rumor has it none of the Beatles were named ""Hamish.""A decent LP, but not all that memorable. For the real deal, track down a copy of the classic live album WINGS OVER AMERICA."
3,"Not bad, but not essential either!","There's little point of this album given that ""Wings over America"", ""Tripping.."" and ""Unplugged"" probably said all that's ever needed on the subject of Paul McCartney live. That said there's still some good versions of old stuff - ""Let me roll it"" and ""Biker Like an Icon"" both sound better than the originals. ""Lady Madonna"" sounds AWESOME here and is my favourite track on the record. The soundcheck section is a complete waste of time, although ""Kansas City"" is ok. ""Live and let die"" makes yet another appearance (!!) and seems enhanced by some cool pyrotechnic explosions. ""Michelle"" sounds exactly like the original and it's nice to here ""All my loving"" again, despite the muffled singing. Shame Macca couldn't have done ""For no one"" instead of ""Here there..."" again (which was on Unplugged). This album isn't bad (and at least there's only 1 overlap with Tripping..), buy it when it's cheap!!"
4,One hot live record,"I'm surprised by this album's disappeareance from the record store. It's hot! I could live without maybe two of the songs, but that ain't bad for circa one hour's worth of music. Check it out; crank it up."
3,"Saving it for the box set, Paul?","WINGS OVER AMERICA is the live Paul McCartney LP to have, but PAUL IS LIVE has its moments. I saw McCartney on that tour (1993) and ask why this CD excludes the best song from the set, ""Off The Ground,"" while including several (""Live and Let Die,"" for example) available on his first two live LPs.When you have as many aces up your sleeve as Paul McCartney, too many gems from which to choose is quite a problem to have. But how I wish PAUL IS LIVE included ""Off The Ground."" He shook Giants Stadium in New Jersey with that one! Maybe in a box set, some day, Paul?"
3,Not spectacular but brings back good memories.,"I saw Paul in 1993 in Boulder and it was one of the best concerts I have ever seen - if not THE best. When I saw this disc a few months later and saw that he had recorded a good number of the tracks at that concert, I knew I had to buy it.It is not a fantastic CD, but I don't think it is ""one for the garbage can"" like another reviewer here stated. It shows that Paul still has passion and energy and a real respect for his work and his audience. The acoustic segment based on his ""Unplugged"" special is especially fun, and how could you not love this version of Live and Let Die (of course, it makes it better if you actually saw the fireworks : ) )It may be the last tour recording we ever get from Paul - I don't see him going back on tour without Linda - so that makes it even more special."
1,Another classic candidate for the trashcan,"I have every Beatles recording on Cd, record and tape etc... I also have all the solo albums by the fab four...My Paul McCartney collection stops with this record. It proves to me that it is true, once you reach a certain age you lose it. On reading into the visuals of the cover I read NOT into the reference of Abbey Road but more to the fact that McCartney is being led across the road by a dog. It's been a long and winding road and he has obviously lost his way.Goodbye Paul."
4,Incredible sci-fi warfare drama,"Imagine if you will: you're a fresh recruit from basic training and you are deployed to your first theater of war...the bad news is that you are sent to the wrong planet, the wrong war, the wrong time, and no one around you expects to past 15 hours upon arrival. Such is Mitchel Scanlon's ""Fifteen Hours"" and for his debut Warhammer 40k novel we are given nothing less but a novel short of masterpiece. This novel is user friendly for those who are completely uninitiated to the 40K realm. For fans of 40K this novel will rank right up there with the great ""Guant's Ghosts"" series as far as Imperial Guard novels goes.An excellent and easy read. Plenty of action and comic relief. Reccomended age: 12+. My only problem with the story was that the ending left too many loose ends as far as the fate of certain characters. Still a good book though."
3,"Too many flaws to this story, lacked depth and credibility","I had pretty high expectations for my first 40K SF novel.This is just me: I think orks are a dumb concept for the 40K genre. I won't read anymore novels that have orks. They're just too dumb to compete in the future; should have gone extinct with WH when that epoch ended.Fifteen Hours:It wasn't til I finished the book that I realized this was Mitchel Scanton's first novel. I modest effort but relatively speaking the novel lacked depth (comic bookish), had too many flaws, I mean flaw-ridden. Some events/actions simply lacked logic.These and the storyline proved disappointing. That and most of the characters interactions and dialogues were just too lenghy for a warzone. There's no way some of those conversations would occur with the environment they were in.I found myself able to put the book down and almost aborted!I don't recommend it."
3,Without hope and without faith,"The first book of Mitchel Scanlon is well written and keeps you reading to the end, but it is toooo dark and grim for my taste. It tells the story of a new recruit of the Imperial Guard that ends up in a wrong war attached with a plattoon of desiluded veterans that have lost their faith in the Emperor. The whole point of the book is to tell how decadent and corrupt the Imperium is, and it does this by making the life of the poor Larn a total misery.Ok, the Imperium is all that, but it also about hope in mankind, faith in the God-Emperor and above all, heroes. That is what I expect in a W40K book, not how life sucks in a nonsense war. Please, Mr. Scanlon, redeem yourself and make some hero take command of the army at Broucheroc to crush the Orks and save the planet in name of the Emperor."
3,"Kind of slow, but a good read.","Granted, nearly this whole book takes place in the span of 15 hours, so you dont expect a whole lot to happen. It was a good read, the characters were pretty memorable. The end wasnt very satisfying though. Worth the read if your a WH40k fan."
4,gutsy and brooding,"This is proper war fiction. There's nothing glorious or pompous here ... its guts and hardship and brooding shadows. The concept works well, and Scanlon is clearly talented ... but something just seems not quite right, somehow. A great read, but it left me a little unsatisfied. Perhaps 15 hours is not enough, after all?"
4,I have seen this tape before.,We watched this tape when I was in elementary school a couple of times. One of them was when we had field day and I refused to participate because the games that they had were stupid and for babies. I didn't tell anybody that a couple a games were for babies except for my mom and my older sister another time. The day my teacher a note home to my family about me not doing field day and I was grounded as a result.
4,The Very Best of Matt Monro,Amazon's prompt and efficient service supplying an ancient classic was impressive. The whole exercise was hassle free and the total time involved was a drop in the bucket. Thank you all.
5,Great Buy!,We bought this scooter for our 7 year old son. We have a long gravel driveway so the bigger tires are a plus!!! Assembly was easy and he loves it. No complaints here! : )
3,Too big for 7 year old,"I purchased the scooter for my 7 year old son this Christmas. He loves his Razor and goes everywhere he can on it. While assembling the scooter was not particularly hard, it did take a good couple of hours. I found the directions to be inadequate. Putting together, and checking, the brakes took the longest. However, I still am not completely comfortable with the brake mechanism.Still, the scooter is pretty sharp and drew admiring looks from other kids and parents when we took it out for a test run. We tried some steep hills and the brakes did stop the scooter. The one drawback is that the scooter is a bit big for a 4ft3"" tall 7 year old. He found it hard to comfortably manage the scooter. His older 9 year old brother was better able to handle the scooter.So the bottom line is that it is a snazzy looking scooter for an older child (at least 4ft9"") though you may want to have the brake mechanism checked out by a technician at a bike shop."
5,Great Scooter !,"I bought this scooter for my son because of balance problems. This Kent Scooter helps his balance and, more importantly, boosted his confidence. Now he likes to get out and ride."
5,Very Pleased,"With all the injuries reported on the skateboard style scooters, it was nice to find one with large pnuematic tires and hand brakes. The kids love riding them and have no problems when they hit rocks and bumps in the road.It was not easy to find an ""old style"" scooter. The build quality is not bad and the brakes were a bit difficult to finally get right. I would recommend this over the small wheel scooters."
1,Avoid,This product did not hold up very well and has to be one of the worst kids toys ever made. Go Razor all day long.
4,Great Product,This product came in a timely fashion and just as described. The scooter is very nice and really well built for the money. It was an Xmas present for my nephew who loved it.
3,Assembly,The scooter itself is well built but it has very cheap brakes that are extremely difficult to put together. I had to pay more than the scooter was worth to have it put together.
3,Way to ruin Christmas!,"This item was shipped to our house directly from the manufacturer. The box has a huge picture of the scooter on both the front and back of the box. This was one of our big Christmas gifts for our daughter. She opened the door when it was delivered, thinking it was her friend coming over to play. Who ships like this, this time of year? We have't even assembled the scooter, because now that the surprise has been ruined, we have to wait to give it to her on her birthday. There was NO warning at the time that I purchased this item from Amazon, that it would be shipped this way. Very disappointing..."
4,"Fun scooter, big enough for an adult!","This scooter is also a fun starting point for a full-size person to use! Personally, I had cross-trained on mine for an inline skating marathon. Of course I had to train on the skates too, but this scooter gave me some days for my back to take a break during the training. After four years, I moved up to the larger scooters with a bicycle (700c/28 inch) front wheel and trained for racing those exclusively. I race a Footbike Track now and have won some major races and set some records, so I think this small scooter gave me a good start. For racing and competing in the sport of footbiking, the wheels on the Kent scooter are too small and too slow, otherwise it's durable enough and the brakes make it safer than inline skating. It's great for around the neighborhood as well as around the park!"
3,Doesn't last long!,"This scooter seemed pretty sturdy at first but things went south pretty quickly. After less than a year, the kickstand fell off & I noticed rust in a few places. Then the brakes started acting up and I noticed more rust. We took the scooter to a bike shop and they actually laughed at the quality of the brakes....they attempted to fix the brakes and they lasted a day or two. Now we have a rusty scooter without a kickstand or working brakes."
3,Beware of the brakes,"I just bought this scooter for my son's birthday.The scooter is well made.What little assembly is done for you is a joke.The brake assembly is shoddy at best.If you are not familiar with hand brakes I highly recommend you bring this to a bike shop for adjustment.I wasn't even lucky enough to have received all the necessary parts in the box.(Whoever assembled this just hand tightened the brakes and the brake pad fell out of the box during shipping.YOU SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED, THIS SCOOTER IS FOR CHILDREN.If the box was sealed properly parts wouldn't be falling out of the box!!!!!!!!"
3,Ouch!,"This is a very fun scooter, but my daughter(after riding for about 5 minutes)needed to stop because she had gotten bloody scrapes.I had to put caps on the axel nuts. this company should sell this scooter with caps to prevent this."
3,COULDN'T MAKE THE BRAKE WORK,"As other reviews said that the instructions are insufficient. You need to understand the mechanism of the brake system. You need few different sizes of wrench for adjustments. After struggling for over 1 hour, we gave up. It's impossible to make the brake front & back work properly. We are just not professionals."
3,delayed shipping,This is a birthday gift. The shipping was delayed for several days and we couldn't get it in time.
3,should be better - low quality,"purchased this last year for my 5 year old and the quality for flat land is great after you get it together. Did have amazon send a replacement because Kent would not send it after they said they would 4 times... Bad customer service.Now after a year, we find that the brakes are useless if you are in the hills. Again, for flat lands, it's good."
5,Proud grandpa,"I recently purchased this scooter for my grandson. On the outside of the box there is a list of tools required for assembly, which is miss-leading. Here is a list of tools which I used to make the assembly very easy: a 6mm allen wrench; a 8mm, 13mm, and a 15mm open end wrenches; and a pair of pliers. The adjustable wrench that was recommended was too awkward to get into tight areas. The assembly took about 30 minutes. I was very pleased with this product, I'm sure my grandson will have many hours of fun riding his scooter."
3,Kent Super Scooter,"The scooter was basically pretty easy to assemble but it is impossible to adjust the brakes! I probably should have purchased the item at a bike shop or local retailer who would have put it together and made the adjustments. Now I have to take it to a ""bike shop"" as the instructions say and have the brakes adjusted before it can be used. I am sure the cost of the adjustment will be more than anything I may have saved by buying the item online."
4,Kent Super Scooter vs. Schwinn,"I ordered one Kent Super Scooter with the Schwinn Scooter as a pair. The Kent was a few buck cheaper than the Schwinn and much Nicer. Wheels are bigger, back and front brakes and handel bar adjustmet for small and somewhat larger kids. The Schwinn is too small for my 8 year old and cannot be adjusted. The Kent is still a little too short for my 11 year old, but a MUCH Better Buy than the more expensive smaller Schwinn. Now I'm just looking for a scooter built like the Kent with taller handel bars for bigger kids. Wish I could ship the Schwinn Back and get a second Kent for my 5 year old."
3,There are weight restrictions,"This is advertised as good for kids and parents alike. There is NO mention of a weight limit ANYWHERE in the description nor on the Kent site but when the package came it had in huge writing - 100lb limit! What? What parent weighs 100lbs? We bought this for our 7 and 12 year old children, we figured if it is ok for parents then it should be ok for a 12 year old (he is 5'5"" and over 100 lbs). We decided to take a chance - it flexes a bit on the plastic foot board under his weight and the handlebars are just a bit too short for him but he rides it anyway. It is great on our unpaved road and on the paved walking paths in our area. Putting it together was a snap, and they are well constructed. Despite the false advertising on size restrictions - the kids like them."
5,Exactly what we have been looking for.,"We have been looking for a durable scooter for our 7 year old daughter for awhile. This was a great buy at a great price. We ordered it on a Sunday and received it on Tuesday! Our daughter loves it, and she will be able to enjoy it for a good amount of years. I couldn't believe the quality of the scooter for the price, compared to all of the other scooters we have looked at. Definitely recommend to family and friends."
3,Unhappy Grandma,"This scooter arrived with a twisted tube in one tire. When inflated, it popped. I emailed the company and asked for a replacement tube. No return email was received."
3,Do you like rust?,This is an inexpensive scooter and you get what you paid for. Rims rusted pretty badly and brakes don't work.
4,Great Gift and Safer for Kids than the Razor,"Love this scooter. Had one of these type scooters when I was a little Kid and loved the fact that you can jump ramps and ride off of curbs without breaking bones. When I seen this online, I had to order 2 of them for my 6 and 8 year old boys. They have been riding these almost everyday since christmas morning. Unlike a razor scooter, when you hit a little pebble or a a crack in the sidewalk, this thing keeps going. Very easy to put together. Only problem I had was with the break system, wich still isnt right, but works ok for now. I would say if there was anything I would like to be different, is that the break system be put together before it is shipped. Other than that, I would give it 5 stars."
4,Easy assembly and lots of fun,"My 8 year old daughter loves this scooter, she has ridden it every day since Christmas. It was easily assembled on Christmas eve except for the brakes that took a little more tweaking on Christmas day. Instruction manual should be a little more detailed on brake adjustment."
3,Just Okay,"I bought this scooter for my son who is about to turn 4. The ads said adults and kids alike would love it.Well no way would an adult be able to ride this. The handlebars and deck are way too small. For the overall size of the scooter, the deck is tiny.I liked the idea of front and back hand brakes for my kid. But when I bought a Razor pro for me to ride with him, he went right for the razor and won't let go of it.I think when he gets a little bit bigger, he will like the Kent. But I will say that you should have a pro put it together because of the brakes.Also, the quality is prettty low, the only way I would recommend buying this scooter is if you can get it really cheap, and include the cost of putting it together.Also, you can't really adjust the handlebars.I would look into getting a Razor Cruiser for a kid, before buying this one.It is true that it looks like it can go over rocks and dirt, but I don't think the quality is good enough to last long doing that."
4,Great transition for 6 year old,"This is perfect for our 6 year old son. He's too small for the next size bicycle. It was delivered on Christmas Eve which was great, and it was very easily assembled. There were a few scratches from the box being broken open during delivery, but the unit is solid overall."
2,scooter troubles,"scooter arrived on time and I was excited to put together but directions were poor at best and handlebar was put together wrong with no instructions on how to turn it around and no list of equipment needed or any alan wrench to do it. Also there were no instructions on how to install the brakes, only how to adjust. It was a very frustrating experience!"
2,Poor Quality,"Clearly made in china, bought two for my kids for Xmas and both were poorly boxed and had scratches on them. Also, they are made of sub par components!!"
4,Pretty good for adults,Very confusing reviews about whether it can support an adults weight. Yes it can as long as you're not heavier than 100kgs.
2,queen esther,We purchased this scooter about 4 years age for out son for a Christmas present. The problem is we cannot find an inter tube for the tires. It has been sitting for all of these years. Hopefully one day we can find an inter tube. It is really a nice scooter and my youngest son really loved riding it. I wish I had of known that an inner tube was not available for this scooter. I would not of purchased it. We purchased this item from Amazon. Does anyone know where I can purchase an inner tube for this scooter.
3,"Okay, but...","I got this scooter so that I could ride when it's wet out. My razor will slide all over the place if there's any water on the pavement. The kent seems sturdy enough to handle my 160 lbs, and it's great for riding around as long as you're only going downhill. This thing is a pain to ride uphill, even just a slight incline. It's super slow and really wears out your legs. I think I'll pass it on to my little brother and use the razor when it's dry out. I probably should have just bought a cheap wal-mart bike."
3,My kids hated these,"I dont know, my kids hated these, refused to ride them and said they were too slow. Compared to razor scooters, they really are slow and the brakes were a nightmare. Hard to adjust and just didnt stop the scooter enough. The one plus is that they are very cool looking scooters! Also, I thought having a kickstand on the scooters would end the mess of having razor scooters thrown all over the garage floor, but the kickstand on these was so so hard for a kid to engage, that we wound up having BIGGER scooter all over the floor. You get the idea, these werent very popular here. My kids are 7 and 9 BTW. I kept them around for 6 months or so, and then decided to free up the garage space and sold them at my yard sale."
3,Neat scooter...but required replacement parts and repair,"We ordered 2 of these scooters for our boys for Christmas. When assembling, there was one that came with a bent screw (the major screw holding on the brake assembly)-- had to call company to order new one. It did arrive about a week later. The second scooter assembled pretty well...but the brake assembly is difficult to adjust. It doesn't tighten enough to make it seem safe for the kids to ride. We'll be taking these to a local bike shop for brake install/repair. Hopefully, the brakes can be adjusted properly and they will be safe to ride soon. These look pretty cool...so, we'll see."
5,GREAT SCOOTER,We had no problem putting this together (it helps that my dad is a mechanic!) and the brakes work perfectly. My 6 year old is in love with it because it's just the right size and it doesn't have tiny wheels like her Razor. I personally would reccommend this and especially at this price!
4,Nice scooter!,"Purchased this for my 5 year old and he loves it. Our sidewalks are a little uneven and doesn't work well with the little wheels on the Razor scooters so this was a nice alternative. The only problem with it seems to be that he kicks too fast and forgets to ""coast"" and so it gets away from him sometimes. I'm sure he will get the hang of it after a few more days. The black scooter is sharp looking and it only took about 20 minutes to assemble. Great buy for the money. FYI...it takes up a fair amount of room compared to the smaller scooters and does not fold for easy transport."
4,great scooter bad instructions,Love the scooter. It has helped our son learn to balance and use brakes. He loves it and rides it often. The rubber wheels make it more able to handle bumps and speed. Better instructions would have made putting it together easier.
4,Alriight,The box that it came in was all damaged and parts hanging off the sides. Other then that the scooter runs fine and its good to turn into a goped''
4,Sweet little scooter,"Nice little scooter goes over all terrain.... dirt roads, bumps, gravel are no problem for this scooter. My 9 year old daughter loves it. My neice has a razor scooter and is envious of this one."
4,grape scooter,"The brakes are super cheap other than that good buy for the money .I have 3 boys ,12, 9, and seven.they all ride it and like it .I may end up with 3 of them."
2,ok,we got this kent super scooter for our daughter for Christmas... It took about 3 hours to put it together... The breaks suck bad.... Had a very hard time getting the breaks adjusted and then they wouldn't break on the tires.... Other than the breaks sucking the scooter is nice....
5,great Gift,"I bought this for my son, it reminded me of the scooters I rode as a kid, not like these rinky dink ones they sell now with roller blade tires. My son loves it. Would definately recommend it for your child"
3,Brake Problems,The scooter assembled quickly until we got to the rear brakes. We could not get the brakes to tighten. We were disappointed that instead of giving a troubleshooting idea the instructions told us to bring it in to a bike shop. We did and they were able to tighten the brakes completely.
2,But for a 50 cent tool,Failure to include a small hexagonal tool to tighten the handle bars set me back several weeks in assemble. Even Ikea includes these types of tools for free. Unfortunately they were of a different size so I couldn't use one of them. Consider your access to a Hexagonal tool bit set before you buy.I'm still optimistic about my daughter enjoying it but right now it is taking up space and I still have the brakes to put on.
1,Missing Parts,"Bought two of these scooters for my grand children for Christmas and during assembly discovered one of them had MISSING PARTS...I contacted KENT COMPANY and was told they would ship me the missing parts..Well that,s been almost four weeks ago and They still have not Shipped them..I would NEVER buy another KENT PRODUCT....Jerry Owenby"
2,Looks nice BUT.....,Got scooter for 7 y/o grandson for Christmas. Assembly was sodifficult that I had to take to bike shop where it had to be stripped downand rebuilt. Turns out the brakes were assembled backwards at the factory. I had to pay $50 to have it fixed. Not a bargain by any standard. Add to that the frustration of the entire episode and I would have to say: NOT WORTH IT !!!
3,Axel Nuts Now Come with Protection,"This is not a review so much as an update of information. My rating of three stars was done merely to locate this review near the one that complains of scrapes. Apparently, the manufacturer listened to that review: I received a unit yesterday (April 9, 2009) and found much to my delight that it came with plastic caps for the axel nuts."
2,Would be 5 stars if the brakes weren't so bad...,"We bought this scooter for my 6-year old son. It is very well built, solid and heavy which is just what any American 6-year old boy needs. However, the brakes are HORRIBLE! I spent about an hour adjusting them, but they loose their setting almost daily. The instructions say to check the brakes every time you ride, I'm sure the lousy quality is why. They either rub the wheel, or stop working all together.We'll probably replace this shortly unless we can fix it, my wife and I are both uncomfortable having my son ride this with the brakes so precarious."
4,Glad I Finally Made This Purchase,"I was hesitant to buy this product because of some of the comments about how hard it was to assemble the brakes. My assembly experience consists of putting furniture together and hooking up electronics, so I wasn't sure that I'd be able to get it right. However, it wasn't really that bad. The assembly time was about an hour, and 45 minutes of the hour was spent on the brakes, which I was able to do by myself. It just requires a little patience to find the ""sweet spot"". The instructions are helpful, but they are misleading in spots. Some things I just figured out by trial and error. I rode the scooter after I had assembled it, and it's a lot of fun. I'm tempted to keep it for myself! I only gave it four stars (out of five) because some of the decals are already coming off."
1,Wrong book shipped - Plus I Paid Shipping,"Very unsatisfactory experience. I ordered this book for my husband for Christmas. Not only did I receive the WRONG BOOK, but I got little response regarding how to get the correct book in time for Christmas (which never happened). TO TOP IT ALL OFF, I HAD TO PAY FOR THE SHIPPING...BOTH TO ME AND BACK. THEIR MISTAKE. MY COST. FAIR??? NO, NOT AT ALL."
5,Incredible,I am not a big fan of pop music or pop ballads but this song is undeniably incredible. Daniel Bedingfield almost makes you feel what he's feeling in this song. I was completely taken aback. Everytime I hear this song I not only want to sing along but I want to cry. I reccommend this song to anyone who's longing for an unattainable love. This is a great song!
5,He's don't it again!,"Daniel Bedingfield's new song ""If you're not the one"" is great. I own his CD and I listen it all the time. This song is really deep. The remix is cool also. This is talent!"
5,Daniel Bedingfield is at it again!,"When my girlfriend and I heard this song, it just had to be ours. So, now it is officially our song! Please go out and buy this single. I promise you will not regret it!"
3,beautiful and compelling words,"my favorite song has 2 to be the new single ""IF YOUR NOT THE ONE""the words he uses in this song are so strong that it makes u think so much about what LOVE really is, i mean u feel as thou u need to hold on to that feeling so hard cause u might NEVER feel this way again. I truely beleive that daniel bedingfield has really summed up the word LOVE and its emotions in this song and its lyrics."
3,SEX DRIVE by Grace Jones,"It's a perfect song for her. She was just ahead of the dominatrix curve way back when, even though you know she'd likely already toyed with plenty else by that point! The sound is quite hard-core, it's hard & fast driving edge unlike anything else she'd done, which alone makes it a must have for her fans. The spiky sorta dance-hop sound they produced is already classic & the smaqin' house baseline pops me in a more satisfyin' way than really just about any other. Cheers to her for knowing how to get such consistently raw sounds!! I also like the shiny black on black of the plastic jewel case... What's next + + + We've been kept panting for tooo long..."
2,Wrinkles are God's Makeup,"For someone who is just starting face reading, this book is confusing and somewhat contradictory. In a number of instances the photos are not clear, making it difficult to distinguish the particular characteristic being referred to. The authors attitude on cosmetic surgery is bizarre and her political beliefs shade her readings.I own 8 books on face reading,and for beginners I would recommend: Amazing Face Reading by Mac Fulfer."
5,Reading old records,"The book incudes clearly photographed old documents, some word for word ""translations, and many examamples of individual letters. It includes tips for 'decoding' which of several 'possible' letters is the most likely in context. Careful study onf this book should solve many problems associated with old documents."
5,Fodor's French for traveler's,"I used this book to review my french before a trip to Paris. I've used several similar books by other authors in the past. This one is the best. The dictionary in the back, and the section on grammar were very helpful. Highly recommended."
1,This book is not for the novice,"This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory. I found ""French in 10 Minutes a Day"" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook."
3,fodor's french for travelers,Could be smaller in size so it would be easier to carry. Lot's of information enclosed which will be very helpful for traveler's.
1,This item is not by Nikon,"I was very disappointed about this item. Because this item is completely imitate. There is no pad in the leather case and looks very cheap! Especially the battery dose not has hologram by Nikon, means this is imitated. Nikon announce about imitation battery and there is a possibility explosion of battery. I do not want loose my Coolpix, I discard this battery immediately. Please take care!! Do not waste money."
2,The product review is a lie,There is NO adjustable shoulder strap. The unit itself is ok but not great. It's compact and stylish which is nice. The pocket for the extra battery has no padding or anything to hold the battery in so if it gets tipped at all while it's open the battery falls out easily. There is an opening for a belt loop but I'm sorry - who wears a camera case on a belt loop? I bought it to have the shoulder strap which is nonexistent. It's nice to have an extra battery but you could do better than this carrying case.
3,Nikon Leather Case,"This case is small. I thought it would fit my CoolPix 5000, but it does not. The leather is soft & genuine with a real leather smell to it."
2,Offers very little protection for the camera,"Although the camera fits in this case perfectly, it basically offers no protection if you should drop it. It is a very thin, leather like case. There is also no where to hook a neck strap except by running it through the belt strap. All in all, if I had known these things these things up front, I wouldn't have purchased this case."
2,Not very interesting book,"The topic is interesting, good work, but the context was written in a boring way. This could be a much more colorful book. It seems like the book was written for medical students or physicians as a conventional educational material. The reader can find more of the context through the official website of nobel prizes. The book does not cover recent Nobel Prizes on infectious diseases.Onder Ergonul,MD,MPHAssociate Professor of Infectious DiseasesMarmara University, School of MedicineIstanbul, Turkey"
4,Sweet and Clean,"Economically priced tape featuring 1991 PMOY Lisa Matthews, who has one of the most dazzling smiles you'll ever see. But memo to playboy video producers: Your target audience doesn't want to see any pretty-boy boyfriend-playing actors in these videos (male model plays boyfriend in 2 quick scenes). Matthews went on marry a high-powered Hollywood producer, thus sending the featured escort back to waiting tables, I imagine. A bonus is a short feature on Lorraine Olivia."
4,MMMM....LISA IS SOOO HOT,"She's my favorite playmate of the '90's, and like all playboy videos, this one tends to move around too quick and never show you quite as much as you want to see, or last too long --- I think it's under 30 minutes of Lisa, believe it or not. But she is sooo hot and there are enough fully nude scenes with decent close-ups and lighting that it's worth it, especially at the price it's being sold at."
4,TRACK LISTING:,"This is a 5 track Maxi CD single whose UPC number is 008815435420 (number matches Amazon's database) and it has the following tracks:Come & Talk To MeAlbum EditRadio RemixHip Hop RemixHorny MixGotta LoveNewe R&B; EditAll remixes of Come & Talk To Me were done by Sean ""Puffy"" Combs (now known as P. Diddy). Gotta Love was remixed by DeVante Swing."
4,I give the guy props for his cool outfit and sense of humor!,"I just finished watching ""Too Far Gone."" Whoa... Not only does it have practically nothing to do with Tori Amos, it is just.. strange... The leading man who belives himself to be Tori handed me this DVD for free at Benaroya Hall last week, where I attended Amos' concert. He was hilarious in person and complimented my shirt! I love independant films and to get one with at least something to do with Tori for free!!! was pretty damn neat. The film itself was very funny, but a little uncomfortable at times, (and sad). But the craziness and hilarity is more overpowering than that. This is a keepsake from the concert I will remember (and question) forever."
5,Speechless,"This dvd has 5.1 dolby digital surround sound, let me tell you there is no other way to watch a concert dvd other than in surround sound. I have sourround sound in my room and the preformance was soo good, i felt the room shake and so did my body. It sounds like you are really there, you heard the crowd behind you coheed's guitars from the left and right speakers and the lead singers voice from the central one. It is an experience that everyone should do at least once. This is one Concert DVD you will watch over and over again."
4,buy this DVD/CD it is worth it,"This DVD/CD combo is a very worthy effort by Coheed and Cambria. It includes all of their hit songs and they are a joy to watch live. The only bad thing about this package is that the audio on the DVD is sub-par. This doesnt mean that it is bad, it just isnt the kind of quality I would expect from a big time band like Coheed and Cambria. Even though the audio isnt that great, I still watch the thing all the time. The best part of this package is the CD that comes along with it. This is worth buying this product alone. I suggest putting the CD on full blast and watching the DVD on mute. All in all I give the DVD 3 out of 5 and the CD 5 out of 5 which averages out to a decent 4. This should hold anyone that needs a Coheed fix until they put out their next CD"
3,Should look at others first.,"When I wear a black shirt to bed, there would quite a few little feathers covering it in the morning. Otherwise, I hardly see feathers on my bed.It could be itchy at time, or maybe I have sensitive skin.But, a pretty good blanket.Kept me warm and somehow cool at the same time.I like it.Good luck!"
4,Kingston Trio The Capitol Years,"I love the Kingston Trio and I have several sets of their CD's. The sound quality in these 4 CD's wasn't as good as in my other sets. However, as I said, I love the Trio and this set has a lot of songs that I don't have in my other sets and if you are as big a fan as I am, this set is still very enjoyable."
1,Capital Years,I would not buy these CDs again - some of the songs (I believe on the 1st disc)are unplayable - A big disappointment for a big Kingston Trio fan
3,The Capitol Years Box Set,I gave this collection an average rating. I believe that there are too many tracks that are below the standard that I expect from this group.I believe that advertising jingles should not be included in an album.
2,Where's The Beef?,How can Capitol release a collection of this scope and not include The Merry Minuet and Billy Goat Hill? Very disappointing.
3,"The Classic songs were fantastic, the others were poor!","Some of the ""previously unreleased"" songs should have stayed that way. One of the best songs that the trio ever did was ""Across the Wide Missouri"" on the ""Here we go Again"" album. This version of that song on disk one was interrupted no less than ten times by someone caughing in the audience. Most other ""Live"" performances by other artists have a much better sound quality. None the less, their classic songs, as always, are fantastic."
3,cute pink camo,"This pink camo onesie is adorable and highly complimented. Don't you love those ""you have the cutest baby"" remarks? But the snaps did break off relatively soon, so it's not as durable as other onesies."
3,adorable saying says it all,"All of our military family loved this saying on our daughter's onesie. What a nice homage to her Daddy's service in the Marine Corp. However, keep in mind the snaps broke off after wearing a couple times, so I was disappointed she couldn't wear it more."
3,Historically accurate,12 episides (6 per disc) 30 minutes each. The acting is good. Sound is fine but picture is poor because the 16mm film prints (used for the DVD transfer) are worn with noticable dirt & scratches in the picture which distracts from the enjoyment of the episodes. From a historicle point of view these are fine & true to the Bible. You may want to watch one episode at a time (as I did) rather than watching the whole thing in 1 to 4 sittings.
1,CeleLedZep,The booklet's print is quite small. nearly impossible to read. I originally tried to order the 2007 perf with the 3 and Bonham's son.
3,Surprise Ending,Good Book. Kept me off balance. Language offensive but a good plot. Holds your interest
1,b-o-r-i-n-g,i picked up this book because i thought it was a thriller..it was very boring..the love story overshadows the thriller part and it was predictable from the beginning..you can even guess the culprit easily..not a very challenging read for me..i have had better
1,Slept,"A vast disappointment. I love Linda Howard, but this was her worst book. Assassins are not feeling people, and this one was depicted as a feeling assassin who just needed some counseling as she was still very ready to kill. It never explained why this particular girl was an assassin-no murky background. The plot I had figured out in the first quarter, and you'd have to be an idiot to think the hero was going to kill her, so there went that bit of suspense. Superficial and I'm sorry I bought it at inflated canadian prices. I'll have to wait 2 years for her next one, as I won't be buying hardcover from her again, and will carefully scrutinise it and read reviews before I waste my money, something I've never done before with her. 0*"
1,I can't believe I hated a Linda Howard book,"I have every book that Linda Howard has ever written. This is by far the worst book I have ever read. Everything about this book was wrong. One cannot identify with an assassin. . A true Linda Howard Fan, would not like this one."
4,Pretty good,"It was very interesting, all the way to the end. I would definitely, and probably will, buy more of Linda Howard's books."
4,"Loved it all but,","I, too, am a huge fan of this writer and love all of her books for the most part. I loved this story too EXCEPT the ending. I don't think it should have ended the way it did. I had a few issues with it. I felt like Ms. Howard rushed it a bit too much for me to fully enjoy. Even so this is a great story and well worth the money you shell out for a hard copy."
2,Wait for the paperback.,"Not Howards best - not even close. I'm used to Howard writing ""I can't put it down, what a page turner!"" kind of books - not ones were you're aware of the end of every chapter and even looking ahead to how many pages until your done."
2,disappointed,"I usually read Linda Howard books in one sitting, however, i struggled to read this book, and only did the effort because i was hoping it would get better. After all, it is a linda howard book!!!. Main character, LILY, CIA Assassin, was such a wimp, her character was totally unbelieveable. .....I,m afraid Linda has fallen into the same game as alot of popular writers, spit out a book, through your name on it, and based on past books get a lot of readers to buy thier books. For her next one, ill just wait and get it from the library"
4,A quick read with substance,"Lily is a veteran assassin who has gone off the reservation after her friends are murdered; her new mission is revenge. Swain is the CIA operative sent to stop her. What neither of them realize is just how much they need each other.Knowing she can't work alone against the powerful Nervi family, Lily includes Swain in her plans to take them down - even if she goes with them.Linda Howard has written a fast-paced suspense novel with all the humor, romance and action we've come to expect. A great beach read!"
1,NO WAY!!!!!,"I'm so glad i borrowed this book from the library..had i plunked down the cash for it, i'd have been pretty upset. This book was soooooo boring...i made it to page 97 and decided to call it quits...no way was i going to try to finish it seeing my attention span was nill. I'm very surprised because LH usually writes such great, engrossing books. Don't waste your money on this one!"
3,Mediocre Howard,"I normally love Linda Howard's novels -- I reread Mr. Perfect several times a year -- but this one disappointed me. I skipped many paragraphs, even pages. Looking forward to the next one -- hopefully it will be back to the Linda Howard I love."
2,An Assasin??,"I can't believe Linda Howard made her heroine an assasin. It was impossible for me to identify with her--it is one thing to be an agent who will kill if absolutely necessary and another to just go out and kill designated people. How can there be a positive life force operating in her? Sorry, just didn't go for it."
2,Kiss Me While I Sleep,"Very disappointed in this book. I usually like Linda Howard's books, but this was not my favorite."
3,A spy with a sense of humor!,"For that alone I could kiss Lucas Swain, never mind that he is a secondhand version of John Sandford's fabulous cop Lucas Davenport. Because of the rather ripped-off version of Davenport (one of my all-time favorite fictional characters)and because the intrigue isn't terribly intriguing, I gave this only 3 stars. That isn't to say I hated the book or that I didn't enjoy it: The banter between hero and heroine is pretty funny - but just a little too much like Davenport and one of his ladies to feel original. If I hadn't read 'Cry No More' right before this one I might have liked this book better, but CNM was a top-notch and very moving story. My expectations may have been a little too high coming off that book. I think I'll go re-read one of Sandford's books now!"
2,Not her best work,"I have read all of Linda Howard's books but I must agree with those who have said this is not her best work. The plot was predictable and I figured out the ending halfway through the book. The love story was routine and the two main characters never seemed to ""click"". It didn't work for me as either a suspense novel or a romance."
1,Are you kidding me????,"I was checking out Linda Howard's books and was all set to buy one, but now I've changed my mind. Anyone who can write a novel where the main character is a professional killer has to be morally bankrupt!"
2,maybe 2 1/2 stars.... just wasn't great,"I dunno, the plot line was a little too... la femme nikita for me. I couldn't really get into it. The romance was somewhat believable, but I don't think it salvaged what I found to be an overly unbelievable plot. My first LH novel."
4,A very enjoyable read.,"Every summer I get to enjoy a good story by Linda Howard. I simply am looking for a good read. There is never the perfect story by anyone, so, some reviews are too serious for me. I do know what it is like to ge let down by a read but there are so many books out there that I am just happy to know I will enjoy the storyteller's tale...and that is what it is all about. :)"
1,Bring back the old Linda Howard!,"I agree with those who have said this book is boring. I can't believe LH was capable of writing a boring book, but here it is.I long for the books LH used to write before she went ""big time"".Love stories like ""Diamond Bay"","" Duncan's Bride"" where the characters and their situations were believeable. Where one really cared about the characters and what happened to them. Books one would keep to read again and again when one needed a heart-warming story.I wish LH would fire her agent amd go back to writing books for Silhouette. Those books were in general terrific!"
5,Kiss Me While I Sleep - Loved it!,"I finished this book this morning and I can't stop thinking about it. I fell in love with Lily and I fell in love with Lucas. Linda Howard allows you to truly get into both of their heads and understand their thoughts and reasoning. This made me feel so close to them. Because of the negative reviews, I almost didn't purchase this book - so glad I did. I was out for dinner this evening and believe it or not (even though I was having a wonderful time), my mind kept slipping back to Lily and Lucas. I didn't want the story to end. I got so attached to them. It was as if they were a part of me. I highly recommend this book. I wish Linda Howard could come out with a second book about Lily and Lucas so those of us who fell in love with them could see how they are doing.Great going Linda - please keep them coming!"
4,While not my favorite,"Kiss Me While I Sleep was still a good story. I found it interesting that she could take two assassins and still make you relate to them. I found their motivations plausable (an important aspect to me) and the love scenes enjoyable if not thrilling. All the same, I probably won't re-read it."
4,I loved the cover!!,"I have read 99% of Linda Howard's books. I love conflict between the heroine and hero as long as it is not mean spirited. The lady assassin premise was different and Lily was not butch at all. Swain was very well written altho not as deeply as I would like. The 'end' of their relationship was very poignant. Her interview with Frank was a great surprise. So was the 'kicker' to their assignment. I myself loved ""Cry No More"" but I also enjoyed this book very much. Read it overnight!!!! Mr. Perfect was more humorous but this had a better punch. I read All of LH's books. Have several of the 'older' ones as keepers. She never disappoints!"
2,Disappointed,"I own every book Howard has ever written. Most I really like, even her bad ones are better than what most writers can do. This unfortunately, is one of her bad ones. The only truly interesting part is the end. I had no interest in any of the characters, and didn't care what about what happened to them."
2,disappointed,"This book was a disappointment for me, because it lacks the qualities I liked most about Linda Howard's other books. The main characters are cold. I mean how warm or endearing can they be when they're assasins? The action seemed okay, but the romance lacked. It does seem, like someone else said, on the order of All the Queen's Men. I just don't care for the super spy stories when I'm wanting romantic suspense. For that I could watch or, I suppose, read James Bond. Maybe the author is wanting to switch genres."
3,Interesting..................,"Had this book on reserve at my library to see if I wanted to buy this book in paperback,but the jury is still out on this idea. I had trouble getting into the begining of this book because I had trouble sympathizing with Lily. To me she just didn't seem be the sympathetic kind of character that she should be. The other problem was Lucas Swain. I could not get into him as a hero type. He was not at all like Sam Donovan or Ben Lewis her other main male characters. After the first 100pgs. or so the book finally picked up and took off for me. Of all of her books to me this book was her weakest,not her worst just weakest. I'm still planning on reading her book coming out in June it looks good. I'm not sure if I can recommend this book you will just have to read it to find out."
2,Uhhh...no.,"Howard misses the mark with this one. Besides being rather raunchy (not always a bad thing, but not plausible here) Kiss Me While I Sleep is boring. Sure, there's a female on the run, but the love interest doesn't even meet her face-to-face until the middle of the book, and we're supposed to believe they're in love by the end? Riiiggghhhttt...Lucas Swain's character is supposed to be witty --however, the dialogue is monotonous and boring. The characters were laughing, but I wasn't. Stick to Mr. Perfect if you're looking for witty banter.I liked the idea of a female contract agent. I even liked the substory of the infectious disease plant. I just didn't get the romance, and that's what a ROMANTIC suspense is supposed to be."
3,Alot of Mystery with a little bit of Romance!,"My favorite author is Linda Howard. I've read every single one of her books and noticed thru out the years how they have gotten better and better. I like her books because unlike alot of authors she has romance books with some mystery, along with great love scenes. Recently I read ""Cry No More"" which was really good but this one was more mystery than romance. Than I read ""Kiss Me While I Sleep"" and of course since she is such a great author the book was good, but I felt there was hardly any romance at all. It seemed just like alot of other authors out there. I was disappointed but if you like more mystery in your books its the one for you."
2,Handset Buttons Stop Working,"I've had the phone for quite some time (four years?) and it is difficult now to get the buttons on the handset to operate. You have to apply a lot of pressure, and it frequently results in entering numbers twice. I inquired with Panasonic on replacement handsets, but they indicated they can only be repaired, which is quite costly. Customer Service is obviously outsourced to non-English speaking country where they were unable to provide much assistance - as they couldn't even find the product with the model number. It could just be that my time is up with this item....but I've heard similar complaints. Otherwise...not a bad item."
2,Save Your Money,"The talking caller ID only gives the name and not the number, so a call from someone you know (eg MOM back in Podunk) is just like the call from the magazine salesman -- ""out of area"" is all you hear. You can't program the caller id to recognize the number as ""MOM"". Voice quality is marginal. So that people can hear your recorded greeting, you have to shout into the microphone, which is too directional. But on sale, it's worth trying as perhaps a second phone on the line."
2,Disappointing,"A big disappointment for me. No where close to my old panasonic which lasted several years. Bad echo when talking, computer caller id which is totally incomprehensible, low volume. I have had it for 1 week but have decided to return it."
1,Bad Phone,This is our second Panasonic phone. They have both had multiple problems. After a year of constant problems our current phone (this model) has finally died (for no good reason). We have had problems since day 1 - with the most common being 5-10 second gaps in reception about every 15 minutes of use. Minor but very iritating. You would think if they can make phones that get reception off a satelite that getting reliable reception on the couch would not be a major engineering hurdle. I would not buy another panasonic phone.
1,Don't buy any Panasonic products anymore.,"I used to think that Panasonic products meant quality. However after buying this phone, I am very disappointed with the quality control at Panasonic. The unit looks okay but after I charged the battery and tried to set the base unit, the handset failed to communicate with the base. It kept giving the same error ""No link to base. Place on cradle and try again."" again and again. The manual says to go near the base, raise the antenna etc. I was trying the setup with both the units practically next to each other. Panasonic support was the worst. They couldn't help at all and wanted to insist that the unit was fully functional and it seemed like I was doing something wrong. Since the unit was purchased more than 30 days ago, I had no option other than to scrap it and purchased a Uniden phone."
1,Got Took,I finally received this phone from amazon yesterday after waiting 11 days from order date. I found the box to look as if it were old and the phone itself was not wrapped as if it came directly from the factory. I believe it is a refurbished phone even though I paid for a new one. I paid $52.85 for this phone and tonight I see the same phone from amazon listed at $34.99. What is wrong with this picture?
2,"I like Panasonic, but not this model",I can't recommend this phone. (1) There is a hissing noise in the ear piece. (2) Several people claimed my voice sounded muffled (as if I had my hands were cupped over the mouthpiece). (3) The Talking Caller ID was nearly impossible to understand since the computer voice mispronounced virtually every name.
4,Somewhat lifeless recounting of U.S. Naval Intelligence,"...but I have to give it four stars because it's really one of the few sources of information regarding the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), which interestingly enough is also the genesis for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).Covers the history of the Office of Naval Intelligence from its austere beginnings in the late 1880's as a functional unit of the Bureau of Navigation, amazingly enough.The author culled information from a variety of obscure sources, placed it in chronological order, and gave it a consistent flavor, for which he deserves great credit.If the book has a flaw, it's in the somewhat lifeless retelling of these stories, and overlooks much of the context of the rise of U.S. Naval power in the early 20th century. However, interested readers will surely be able to appreciate the influence that ONI has had on modern warfare and indeed on U.S. foreign policy."
1,Fraudulent Advertising,"This product, which is being advertised by numerous vendors for use with OSX, no longer works with current versions of OSX (from 4 up for sure).Norton has stated publicly that they are no longer providing upgrades forMac related software such as Firewall and Network Privacy.Their Antivirus V10 works with OS 10.4, but in view of their stated policy on other Mac products, one may question whether they will continue to upgrade Antivirus in the future.Intego products do work with current versions of OSX."
1,Total crap!!!,I bought this package after upgraded my PowwerbookG4 to Tiger in Sept. 2005. The Autoprotect and Firewall never worked. The Symantac Co admitted this probelm in their website and never offered a solution for these problems. A piece of junk!!!
2,CASE WAS DESTROYED WHEN RECEIVED,THE CD IS FINE BUT CASE ALL BROKEN ....IN MILLION PIECES... UNUSABLE....I NEED TO GET NEW CASE FOR THE CD
4,Pialat - fantastique,"A gritty contemp French drama like no other. Pialat truely brought the cop genre into the modern era, even before the *so called* impromptu realistic portrayal of cop drams such as NYPD blues and so forth. It was the first to use experimental hand held cameras and improv permances by Depadieu and among the excellent cast, a young Sophie Marceau. The tone and rhythm truely sets itself apart from other very high quality European Cinema of the period(mostly historical)."
3,A Decent Read for Time-Challenged Readers,"This is an interesting story, with a different twist on time-travel. However, it was too short to get me really involved in the characters and their troubles. Despite the shortness, this was written well enough to earn 3 stars in my estimation."
3,"Great story, so-so translation","It's great that this novel (only one of two by Hoffmann) is again available to readers of English. The story -- the adventures of an utterly bonkers, casually homicidal monk with a mysterious and somewhat sinister pedigree -- itself is great macabre fun with a hint of satire.Unfortunately, the translation is not particularly good. At times the prose comes across as clunky and ill-thought-out. In fact, it often reads as if the translator simply typed each sentence into a translation program, e.g. ""Karl der Grosse"" is translated at one point as ""Karl of Grossen"" rather than the more accurate name of ""Charlemagne."""
3,The Monk with a happier ending,"I give this only three stars because as far as Hoffmann goes The Golden Pot and Master Flea were better and tighter novels, in my opinion. However, The Devil's Elixirs makes for a fascinating read."
4,"Genuine country/western music, modern day cowboy songs.","This album is one of the best country/western albums I have come across. Chris Ledoux stays close to the country music style with a cowboy attitude and lyrics, with the perfict voice for the songs he sings."
2,Shame on Capitol/Liberty,"I've been a fan of Chris for more than 25 years, he's my favorite singer, I have all his CDs, I was a member of his fan club for years (till the founder died), and these are great LeDoux songs. But Capitol/Liberty has shamelessly put out way too many Chris collections (this one, greatest hits, live, box sets, early years, rock 'n' roll collection). Enough! And a year and a half after Chris' death, it goes on (""Anthology"" and ""Ultimate Collection"")."
3,Snoop Sisters So So,"I like Helen Hayes. I love Mildred Natwick. But after watching the only season of the Snoop Sisters, I can see why it wasn't chosen to be part of the illustrious Sunday Night Mystery Wheel. There is something off putting about this series and I think it is Miss Hayes. She's really annoying, to be frank. Too smart, too cute, too...irritating? I like the series, I'd buy it again but for once I can see why a series didn't make it past the suits."
2,Who Do They Think They Are?,"The Snoop Sisters was a cute, entertaining series in it's day, but they're asking too much money for this one. Who do they think they are, ""The Rogues""?"
3,snoop sisters,"I enjoyed seeing actors I havent seen in a long time, It was good ,some funny parts. You knew what was going to happen but the sisters were a riot especially when they were driving. It wasnt too long but entertaining. Some surprises, loved the home they lived in and the clothing ."
1,Snoop Sisters,"I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in the quality of the DISCS. Disc 1 played fine, however, disc 2 and 3 were copied over which what appeared to be Banacek.I asked for a second copy and received the same exact same thing. Very disappointed that someone would sell a product that was recorded over and how blatant it was."
4,Miss Marple and Her Sister with an American Twist,"Originally aired on the NBC Mystery Movies series. It has that 70's Universal Studios production look and some great character actors from that era. A bit like Murder She Wrote, but in New York, not Cabot Cove."
1,You can't go home again,"I guess it is true, one can't really roll back the years. It was charming years ago and as memories faded, watching it again should be avoided. The girls were charming (to a certain extend) but the story lines and dialogue were awful and unbelievable. Thank god for the fast forward button on the machine. I can see why it was cancelled after only 4 episodes and the pilot(with different supporting actors). I feel all those shows we loved in the 70's should just be left in our memories as they were enjoyable then. Watching some of them again makes me question my own taste and judgement at the time. Hart to Hart is another series that comes to mind. I do love ""Murder she wrote"" but this one is just too silly."
4,SNOOP SISTERS,THE PLOTS WERE A LITTLE DATED AND DUMB BUT IT IS WORTH THE PRICE TO HAVE THESE TWO STARS ON DVD. BOTH OF THEM WERE EXCELLENT AND A GOOD SHOWCASE FOR WHY THEY WERE BOTH STARS.
5,Good family dvd,"All family members could enjoy this. Old fashion entertainment.reminded me of how I enjoy Helen Haynes.only have seen one DVD, I liked it."
1,Great Show BUT Too Much $$$$$$,"Although I've been waiting for quite some time for ""The Snoop Sisters"" to be available on DVD, I'll hold off buying it. Even at the pre-order price of $40.49, it's STILL WAY.... TOO MUCH MONEY for only 5 episodes. The manufacturer can get realistic and offer it, at the most, in the 25 dollar range or they can sit on them in their warehouse before consumers will pony up that much dough in this economy."
5,Favorite 'Snooping' Sisters,"I have loved Helen Hayes and Mildred Natwick for years and was completely thrilled to have the opportunity to buy this collection. There is not one disappointing moment in any of the shows in the series ~ it is funny, delightful, and endearing all rolled into one lovely collection.Snoop Sisters Complete Series"
2,Wait for the price to go down before buing this item,"I bought The Snoop Sisters dvd to add to my collection of NBC Mystery Movie episodes. I had pleasant memories of the show. But, my memory deceived me. The show is slow paced, even for '70's fair and is often down right boring. So, please wait for the price to come down...dramatically, before purchase. There are three disc, which include a movie and four episodes. There are some good moments, but not for the current price. You may want to spend your money on Ellery Queen instead."
2,Tight Shoes,I have the white and silver shoes. They are really tight. I wouldn't buy them again. The seller was great though and shipped the item in time.
5,Love these guys!,"This was one of my favorite pieces of vinyl. I haven't yet burnt it to CD, and now won't, since I can just buy it. The guitar work on this album is distinctive and totally sweet.The thing that made me think of it was that I'd swear I heard Holzman's guitar playing on a conference-call's hold music. I guess you take whatever gig you can get.Anyway, buy it if you like tasty guitar playing!"
5,Great Music,"Billy Dean is the best kept secret in country music. He has a beautiful voice. His songs are easy listening, have great messages that we can all relate to. This is an album that everyone should have. Recommended by Joel Erickson"
3,Review of Joe Pace CD,I was expecting that the CD would be better than it was but over all it is a good CD to add to my collection.
2,Decent look into Fibonacci Trading,"There are some interesting fibonacci patterns and concepts in this book, but the examples were well chosen and looks great in hindsight. Problems with these types of ""line"" studies is that if enough lines are drawn on a chart, then sooner or later price will bounce from one of them. My recommendation is to purchase Fibonacci Applications and Strategies for Traders by Fisher. Its a good read and gets to the core concepts. This book is just a variation. Average at best."
4,A Good Fibonacci Math Book,"A good instructional book on how to find out and equate the different levels of Fibonacci in any market.Just pure pencil to paper basic arithmetic.The author also uses different examples of when price could possibly reverse using Fibonacci levels which are known in this book as (Fib zones). The author has a lot of rehash methods in this book like (AB CD patterns, symmetry, etc.)So i'm I saying this is a bad book?? NOT AT ALL..It is an ideal book for BEGINNERS, and some INTERMEDIATE not ADVANCED because in my opinion there is nothing that an advance trader has not seen here."
5,Foam Sleeves,This filter system is the best there is on the market! Foam sleeves are a part of it. The entire system is reasonably inexpensive! Thanks!
5,Dragonfly,I love this necklace I have had nothing but compliments and questions on where did I get this necklace.
1,Don't buy this CD!!,"This CD has been intentionally damaged by the manufacturer to prevent legitimate buyers from using it as they are entitled to under US law. This CD will NOT play on some CD players and even when it does play, the sound quality is less than what you get with a regular CD. If you play it on your computer it will install a ""special"" utility to prevent you from making copies and which may interfere with your PC and other audio files you might try to use.The publisher thinks you will buy this CD anyway regardless of this tampering. DON'T DO IT!!! If they want to protect their information so badly, let them KEEP IT!"
1,"Can't listen, can't return. Get digital copy.","Get it from itunes/amazon in mp3 form. Got the cd from the show and it won't work in my 2008 model cd player, cannot be ripped to mp3 for using on the ipod either. This is probably the reason they aren't on mainstream radio. Won't recommend to anyone."
1,Buyer beware!!,"I can't vouch for the music (I haven't been able to listen to it yet), but the CD has been produced so that it won't play on a computer.What a sham by the record company and also the band.Buyer beware. This prevents legitimate fans and customers from listening to the music in many legal ways."
4,Feel good music,"Just pulled this CD out to listen to after a long time on the shelf. Feel good and uplifting music. Not sure where I first heard this band, but glad I found them. One of my favorite songs on the CD is Dream Big.I didn't have problems downloading to itunes and using the music on my iPod."
5,This CD is Timeless!,"I have loved Ryan and the guys since I heard their Dream Big song for the first time on the radio. Every song on this CD touches my heart. Each time I listen to it I find a new favorite song. They will be at Merl Fest in April 2008 in Wilksboro, NC. Don't miss them."
1,"How should I know how good it is, I can't get it to play.","The music sounds great on the radio, and after laying down my hard earned money for this drink coaster, I was looking forward to put it on my Creative Zen. I opened up the ""CD"", put it in my computer, and, WTF, it wanted me to download a special program just to play it! I can't put the music on my MP3 player, and I can't make WMA files for my collection.Well, I did some searching on the web and it seems there is a program called Limewire you can use to find the songs on the internet. So I guess I have to go do that now to get the music I already payed for. This is the last Ryan Shupe CD or EMI label CD I will buy. I guess I will start doing what everyone else is doing and get my music over the internet.BTW, it won't play in my car CD player either."
3,ok..so they like them guls with the tight capri pants,"This song is that bounce, get crunk flavor for ya ear. After hearing it as often as they play it hear in ATL, you will get tired of it. It's cool though, make you wanna party."
1,Worthless junk! Broke in a just few uses...,I bough this for less than a third of Amazon's price at a discount outlet (Ollie's in MD) and is was not worth it even at that price! Both canisters broke after less than a half dozen uses each! Inferior junk!
1,Do not buy,"Unfortunately I also purchased this product and within a few uses I began getting cracks in all my containers.Plastic is very thin and is very low quality, not what I had expected from Black & Decker.Both continers broke within a week, used only a couple of times...I would rate this product a ZERO if it would let me."
1,Chipping Paint :(,"I bought these back in 2007. I used them once or twice and put them on a shelf. I took them down today excited to see some dishes I had forgotten about, lo and behold, the decorative paint was chipping off of all the bowls. Sad, they were quite pretty too."
2,Bad Manufufacturing?,"These dishes are very nice in the photos and when received. The only issue is that we received the main bowl that was damaged, in that the paint surface was chipping off in one spot. That should not happen if chip, dishwasher and microwave safe. We never used them and it was this way out of the box, so we could have received damaged manuf. pieces... Also note: we did not get the series of different bowls, but duplicates.. so don't expect all the serving bowls to be different!"
4,Tropicália,"If you enjoy listening to Brazilian music from the late 1960s, then this album is the perfect solution to your search. This album contains a number of famous singers from the era known as ""Tropicália"" and features some of the most famous songs that you would hear if you were to mention this title to anyone in Brazil. Two of the most recognized singers from that era, who are still active today, are Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. Both are features on this album, along with other singers such as Gal Costa, Nara Leo, and Os Mutantes. This is one CD that you will not want to overlook when it comes to the music from this era. I have enjoyed listening to it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to sample music from the ""Tropicália"" era."
2,Good Product,"It's A ok product but it was shipped without a driver CD, i had to search the web to find them & it wasn't easy."
5,This guy rocks!,"""I Think About it All the Time"" came on sataellite radio about a week ago, and I said, ""WHO is THAT?!?!"" That's all it took! WOW! I LOVE THIS CD!! I've been listening to country for 15 years... Why haven't I heard of John Berry before? Well, whatever... He is GREAT!!!"
2,Poor Branwell,"As far as I can ascertain, there are only two books devoted to Branwell. And this is one of them. The other one (""Profligate Son"") is a bit better. Why has the brother of the Bronte sisters been so ignored? At least Dahpne took the time to notice him. But her book adds little truly useful and new information. So this book is better than nothing. I mean, so many think that Branwell influenced his sisters' writings. It's widely believed that the crazy wife locked inside a room in ""Jane Eyre"" was modeled after Branwell's fits and screams while drunk in his bedroom upstairs and also while later enduring the D.T.s upstairs in his father's room. He is also suppose to be represented through ""Wuthering Heights."" So why has so little been written about him? It's frustrating."
2,only for stationary bike. not bike on trainer.,"can't really use it on a real bike setting on a trainer,,,,,,she talks alot....I thought it would be more of a camara moving through or down the trail.road. ."
5,long way from home,"Growing up in Dayton made an impact on my life so did this band. My Pacer, my girl, Little Kings and Mcguffey Lane."
3,Memories,These songs bring back many memories - but I would like the Original Album with Bob Mcnelly. The band still sounds great but not what I grew up with
2,Found it a bit too technical for my liking,"A very in depth book, but a bit of a bore for someone looking for more actionable items. Kinda reads like a textbook."
4,Spins my pulleys,"Works well enough, seems to be a little better quality than Dayco and most white box (also usually Dayco). V-Ribbed for her pleasure."
4,"Touching and funny, worth owning. Worth re-watching.","This touching movie features incredible animal actors/actresses, oh, and the humans aren't bad, either.More hysterical funny stuff from yer average St. Bernard.The kids will love this one. As a parent I found nothing offensive, and so much good stuff to love about the movie.Worth owning and rewatching."
3,Good for the little ones,"The movie is corny, implausible and poorly acted, but the puppies are incredibly cute! Little kids will love this movie if just for the puppies. If you have young children you want to keep entertained, Beethovens' 2nd will hold their attention. Afterwards, your kids will probably start bugging you to get them a puppy."
3,Better than the first,"It's not often you can say a sequel is better than the original, but I prefer Beethoven's 2nd to the original. It's probably because I saw it at a certain age, what with Ryce discovering boys, I really identified with it. (Even though I couldn't get a boy to look twice at me back then.)This movie pretty much sticks to the same formula as the original, with Beethoven the main focus - Beethoven gets a girlfriend, Beethoven doesn't use contraception, Beethoven becomes a daddy, Beethoven becomes a single daddy, Beethoven gets girlfriend back. You've heard it all before haven't you? There's a couple of silly & forgettable subplots here - Missy's mistress (try saying that when you've had a couple!), Ryce's potential boyfriend, the brother's potential love interest, and the Newtons' air freshener thing.Really, there's not much else to say about it. It's a happy movie, it's sweet, and then you'll put it away until the next time you see a St Bernard."
3,Cuter than the first,"BEETHOVEN'S 2ND, in my opinion, is even cuter than the first BEETHOVEN. I laughed REALLY hard when George (Charles Grodin) first discovered the puppies in the basement of his house and said, ""OH, no!"" Those puppies were REALLY adorable! In my opinion, Regina (Debi Mazar) and Floyd (Chris Penn) were like Cruella and her henchmen, Horace and Jasper! I was glad when the puppies got them all dirty. I mean, what human being would want to drown five sweet, cute, innocent puppies? When Beethoven caused the deck of Taylor's (Ashley Hamilton) lake house to collapse, I was relieved because he saved Ryce (Nicholle Tom) from being raped. In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this cute movie to all you Charles Grodin fans or dog lovers out there who have not seen it."
4,GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL AGES,"THIS MOVIE MAY BE VIEWED BY THE ENTIRE FAMILY, WHICH IS SO VERY IMPORTANT. I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN WITH GREAT=GRAND CHILDREN, DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE WATCHING.THERE SHOULD BE MORE FAMILY MOVIES."
3,Puppies,"Our granddaughter and us love to watch the puppies, puppies, puppies, puppies. We do not like the mean people. Nice story just a little drawn out."
3,Not as good as RATW,"Phantom Power sounds like a disc of Rings Around the World reject songs. But of course SFA are a great band, so even their reject songs are pretty good. What really disappointed me was that the band didn't evolve their sound between albums as they had done previously. Bleed Forever and Golden Retriever are great songs, but the album as a whole sounds like an inferior RATW.Also, I don't really care for all of these bands writing songs that deal with the war with Iraq, 9/11 and these sorts of things. SFA, Coldplay, Blur, Starsailor, Travis(for god's sake) and Muse are just some of the culprits. I don't have any problems with them ideologically (in fact I usually agree), but it just seems cliche and out of place to be writing cynical pop songs about current events. They should write essays or something instead to get it out of their systems."
2,If you liked their other albums...,"you probably won't like this. I have all the other SFA albums (except Mwng) and what I like about the band is their edgy, fast- paced songs. This album is mainly slow stuff (and not even as good as the slow stuff on their other albums) and some of the lyrics are positively insipid. The final four songs on the CD are really pretty good- that's why it gets 2 stars from me. I would suggest buying anything else by SFA before this album- you can't go wrong with the other ones. I'm surprised so many fans of their earlier CD's are so high on this album."
5,One of 2003's Best Albums!,"It's a shame that almost no one in this country has heard of the SFA's. They are one of the most consistent rock groups recording right now. Seven albums in and they still manage to deliver the goods. I think that Phantom Power is always inventive. By turns, beautiful, catchy and just plain brilliant, the new album is yet another marvellous addition to the SFA canon. Much darker in tone than the previous album, 2001's Rings Around the World, much of the material on Phantom Power is a stark commentary on the current world situation.Even at its bleakest, this is an album that will make you feel happy, because the music is just so damn incredible."
4,Blessed by the power of The Phantom,"The Super Furry Animals never made a weak album, and 'Phantom Power' is no different. As it's predecessor was about extravagant production, streamlined sound and themes...this CD is more introspective, mellow and comforting, yet continues the SFA tradition of crafting unique pop-songs the only way they can: with unconventional briiliance. Instead of grabbing your attention with guitar grit, this album is more about subtlety, soothing moods, and making every instrument/note count, eg, Badly Drawn Boy, Mull Historical Society. The SFA's pull this off successfully without straying too far from their neo-psychadelic approach. As 'Rings Around The World' dealt with commentary about the planet, 'Phantom Power' brings you back down to earth lounging in the country somewhere, enjoying airy breezes, and happily content. The Super Furry Animals are maturing as a band...but their music continues to surprise, continues to impress."
3,Good Book,"I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in the JET program. Downsides are its a pretty dated, and the essays in it are all pretty similar. Still, you get to read about a lot of people's experiences. It was definitely worth the money and time to read it."
5,DC McMahan,"One of the best books I've ever read....Awesome Awesome Awesome book.....The book was recommended by a dear friend of mine and I loved it......The book is suspenseful, ethically written and will truly make you THINK about your own life and decisions....I hadn't been to church in over 2 years and I went to church the first sunday after reading this book......I can't say enough good things about this book.....The main character is so well developed and so relatable that you feel like you know him. The book leaves you wanting more about Lester's life....Simply put, it's a good read!!!! The follow-up book ""Ill gotten gains II"" is just as good....Please Claude write more sequels at least make it a Triology!!! Also, loved another book by the author ""Bully in the pulpit""....."
5,The other CD,"Saw Buck in Vegas, they rocked!! They have another CD called ""Sympathy For The Record Industry"". (As if.) Lisa can write and all can play. Good melodies with catchy hooks."
4,anything with don shanks in it is good!,I liked this movie because it had don shanks in it . it is the only reason I bought it.
3,An Interesting Collection of Earlier Essays,"In this recent work Bernard Lewis, a top scholar in his field, reasserts many of his earlier conclusions about the antagonistic relationship between the West and the Muslim world. While this collection of eleven essays is certainly compelling, it does not radically distance itself from earlier works. None the less, Lewis' criticism of several Western authors is informative, and his analysis is concise. Like many of Lewis' other works, it is written in a relatively simple style. An excellent text for mid level university classes. Generally unbiased."
3,Too much obscure material,"The first chapter of the book discusses the geopolitical relations between Islam and Europe, including an interesting treatment of Islamic law. However, the middle sections of the book are dedicated to very technical criticisms of other authors, some of whom wrote centuries ago, for their ignorance of arabic vocabulary, as well as reviews of earlier European books, some of which date back centuries, about Islam. The author is free with his criticisms of other writers whose knowledge of Arabic and Turkish clearly does not match his own. There is a chapter attacking the theory of ""Orientalism"" as propounded by the late Edward Said. Lewis and Said were free with their criticism of each other, and Lewis gives a full treatment of his side of the argument.All of this material is fairly remote from what I expected from the title and summary, especially from a well-known expert on Middle Eastern history and culture."
5,West agaist Islam,One understands the relationship and the conflict between the Christian west and the Islam east. Good study.
1,"Islam is nothing to do with West, Like wise, West is nothing to do with Islam","All seem that Islam is in conflict with West and vise versa. But the thruth is Muslim Arabs(not Islam) and West has long been rivals, poilitically and economically, since the raise of Islam as a religion in Arabs's land. The conflict is a rather power struggle than a belief in Islam as religion. Unfortunately, since arabs are muslim majority, it seems that the problem lies on the Islam as a religion. This is very dangerous for humankind.No Matter whatever the writer try to explain. All idea that position Islam a religion, or any other religion, against something, i.e, West, is bad idea."
1,Another piece of propaganda!,"Lewis has done it again. In his usual style of hiding behind his academic credentials, he has misrepresented Islam and Muslims while trying to appear sympathetic and understanding. Aren't there enough books in English by Muslims that we still need to read such works of prejudice?"
4,analysis that treats Islam with respect,"This book, Islam and the West, is a collection of essays combined to provide three different aspects to the Islamic world. It provides insight to the deeply religious Islamic world and helps to dispelled myths about the vastly different culture. Islam and the West bridged the gap between western ideas and the Islamic values, creating a better grasp on the actions of the Islamic world.Bernard Lewis' book has much to offer its reader, particularly if the reader is has any desire to understand Middle East relations. As Lewis suggests in his book, it is impossible to understand Middle East relations without understanding the Muslim religion and this book provides much of that understanding. This book is a learned, forceful analysis that treats Islam with respect, not condescension. The greatest benefit a reader can gain from Islam and the West, is the rare opportunity to step out of one worldview and catch a glimpse of another."
4,"""Islam and the West""","For their clarity, accessibility and deep insight, these 11 essays represent top grade scholarship on the part of Bernard Lewis. Those interested in the historic interplay between Islam and (for lack of a better word) Christendom, as well as those seeking more knowledge of the roots of current world events, will learn much from Lewis. The essays defending Orientalism and critiquing Western Arabic translations are the best of the bunch."
3,Perching the bird,"The book ""Kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers"" is very aptly titled. It actually is a book about kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers, LOL. If you're interested in this rather obscure subject, this book is a must-have. If not, you may want to spend $97.98 on something else. Say, a book about waxwings, orioles and rooks."
4,Amazing research!,"This book is not the easiest read. That said, it contains amazing detail about Columbus and his several voyages to the new world. I felt the book delivered a good feel for the man and for the times. A tremendous amount of research has been done on Columbus over the centuries and this book seems to touch on the major findings and integrates them well into the overall story. I was amazed at the amount of information to be had and how little I actually knew about Columbus and the history surrounding his discovery of the new world."
2,"The illustrations are nice, but not the print quality","I was disappointed in the print quality of the illustrations. The illustrations themselves are lovely, but the print quality makes them appear fuzzy and unclear. I was surprised at how poor the quality was. I returned the item. Perhaps a newer edition has clearer prints."
2,Unique and different,"Unique and different concept, portraying men & women as attempting to achieve the heights reached by our faithful companions.I found the writing & story interesting at times, but I found the same few ideas & thoughts repeated so often it was distracting.The bitter sweet ending was to be expected. Love between man & dog are the highest of priorities.I would guess the author worships the Weimaraner breed."
4,What happened?,"I am a high school student and I take Cinema and Literature, a college class. I was suppose to read this book, and I did. At the beginning it was going pretty slow...it was too detailed. Then around the middle it started to get good. At the end, it left me empty. I felt like everything I wanted, and was expecting to be answer was not. It is an okay book if you are able to understand what happens at the end, I didn't."
4,Excellent Source of Information on the History of Aviation,This magazine is an excellent source on aviation as well as space. It's focus is on aircraft and spacecraft (together with profiles of the men and women who piloted such vehicles). You will find details on a variety of aircraft going back to the first flights in aviation history all the way up to the present time. It also has excellent coverage of the history of the U.S.'s space program - again - both historical and prospective. I recommend this magazine to anyone interested in the history of aviation and space.
4,"Despite its left leaning views on environmental issues, it is a great magazine","This has become one of my newest most favorite magazines in the field of aviation. I read a lot of aviation related magazines but Air & Space has found a fine place in my heart and bookshelf. Their articles are really easy to read and digest for almost all ages and backgrounds. The photos are not as good as one expects but they are still among the best in the field. All in all this is a fine publication. I like their recent pieces on Vietnam era fighter/bombers (F-4s and F-105s in Feb & Mar 09 issues). And despite their leftist views on climate change, this is a great magazine. I like it and I am glad to be buying it."
3,"Acoustic???? Well yeah, but........","I hate to review something by an artist(s) that I am biased for or against. And I truly love the Nitty Gritty Dirt band, for 5 years I lived their music, I collected everything I could get my hand on. So let me try to lower myself to critic status for this review.I kind of think they were running out of ideas over at Liberty Records. ""Acoustic?"" To me it sounds like any recording the Dirt Band has ever made.There are a few standout tracks. ""Cupid's Got a Gun"" with lead vocals by Jimmie Fadden is one that truly stands out. ""Badlands"" with Jeff Hanna's lead vocals is another standout.But really, this comes across as any other Dirt Band album. Not that that would be a bad thing, it is just that most of their cd's after Circle II pretty much ran together.Get this, you won't be disapointed, but you won't be floored either."
5,NGDB Acoustic a great listen,This is not a recent NGDB release but I wanted it on my Kindle so I bought it again. Great album.
4,Sword display,"Nice little display - reasonably price. Just be-careful putting together, this item requires pre-drilling or it will split - even with the small hardware included."
1,"Poorly designed, cannot put together","Product has dovetail slots pre-cut to fit the pieces of wood together, but the slots were too small so I couldn't put the thing together unless I cut the slots wider or shaved the other side down. After I noticed this I didn't really inspect the thing further but it looks like the pre-drilled holes for the other back section were poorly done and pushed through the outside. It's a little tough to explain but basically it's a shoddy product that's built poorly. Granted, if I could have got it together I wouldn't have cared about the other imperfections, it would be hanging on my wall right now, and it would have got a better review since it was inexpensive and arrived quickly."
1,Eliot is rolling over in his grave.,"I purchased this CD in hopes of using it for a literature class. It contains short and long versions of Eliot reading ""The Waste Land"" and Eliot reading ""The Hollow Men."" However, when I recieved the disk, and put it into the car's CD player, I was shocked to hear what sounds like a 1980's drum machine and electronic ""music"" superimposed over the original recordings. The monotonous high-energy ""music"" is mixed over the reading in such a way as to dominate the recording. Although Eliot's reading is a bit monotonous in itself, I do not think that this interpretation was what he had in mind when he recorded it. This treatment makes these two poems seem frivolous and unimportant. My wife, no poetry buff, found the ""music"" irritating within seconds.Unless you like anachronistic misfits like _Moulon_Rouge_, you might want to let this one pass."
1,Caution!!!,This is coffeee....not what is listed above. This is coffee which is made from macadamia nuts! Not chocolate covered macadamia nuts! FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!
2,Complcatd,"Chair works ok once you get into it, of course you have to sneak up on it, to get into it. Also chair does not lock once you are in it, so you have to balance yourself and you never quite feel like the position you are in is the position you will stay in. The upside is that once you are in the chair is awesome to sit in and gives no back pain after sitting in it for hours"
2,Absolutely the Worst Phone; Terrible,"This is the worst phone for the money I have ever owned. I agree with the earlier reviewer that the handset caller ID works only about 30% of the time, and for the money, the features are not that great. I will never buy another Panasonic phone again.I also have the extra handset for this, which works poorly. Half the time, I pick it up and say, ""Hello,"" and it beeps and says, ""No connection to base."" My friends are sick of me saying, ""Hold on, I'm having a problem with my phone."" I have a $10 model that works better. Defintely don't buy this."
2,Not so great battery,I bought this phone based on consumer report reviews and the corded phone works great but the battery in the cordless phone is terrible. The battery dies after 1 hour of conference call. Then it would take at least 8 hours to recharge again.I would not recommend this phone especially for business use.
3,Not good enough,"I bought this phone for my family with 2 additional handsets.I liked the idea that the base unit is NOT cordless, so the kids will not be able to ""loose"" the phone in the house.Biggest problem: The base unit volume is way too low in speakerphone mode and when you lift the handset.Another problem is the timestamp that comes at the end of each message.In addition, it is too easy to erase numbers/messages by mistake...The only other problem we have is with the cordless units:If the speakerphone volume on the cordless unit was left at max, many times when you turn it back on, the (battery voltage drops too low and the) phone ""dies"" and lose connection with the base.You can't lower the volume unless you charge the phone more...The TG2770 is quite expensive and should not have issues like that!"
2,"After a year, two batteries expired and 1 dead display","I've had this for a year and after very light use, both handset batteries can't hold a charge and one of the cordless handset displays is dead. I've had a number of Panasonic phones, and this was a real disappointment.The handset batteries are famous for lousy performance - get the Energizer replacement P511 battery right away. The poor performance starts fairly quickly, so save yourself from lost calls.Another unexplainable thing - only 2 of the 3 mailboxes can be protected with a password, the primary one (#1) cannot.All-in-all, a feature-laden mediocre to low quality phone."
4,Problem with Caller ID,"We got this phone system so my husband and I could use the intercom feature to talk to each other from opposite sides of the house. Works great for this purpose. However, on the cordless handset, the caller ID doesn't show up until after 3 rings, then you have to hurry & answer it before the answering system kicks in. My husband ended up having two different cordless phones on his desk; one for the intercom and another one so he can see the Caller ID display. What a pain in the neck!! I e-mailed customer support at Panasonic a couple of weeks ago and have heard NOTHING from them.UPDATE: 3/17/04 - We still had no reply to our e-mail, so we called the toll free customer service number. They guided us through the steps to change the ""Line Mode"" from the factory setting of B to A. This solved the caller ID problem. They still should have responded to my e-mail, but I'm changing my rating from 3 stars to 4. I'm pretty satisfied with the phone now."
2,"Great for what I wanted, disappointed in Quality","I purchased this phone 1 year ago this month. It was what I thought was the perfect solution. A corded phone with matching cordless phones, (my system came with 2 cordless phones)& it was expandable, plus I didn't need to have a phone jack to plug in the cordless phones, just an electrical outlet for the chargers. About 4 months after purchase, the ""Number 2"" cordless phone wouldn't work. It wouldn't charge, I couldn't answer the phone using this handset & it keeps saying I have to move closer to the base, even when I am sitting right next to it. Now it doesn't work at all. The answering machine was okay & not to difficult to use, I also like the other features. I thought I would go back to the store where I purchased it & return it for another one just like it or send the bad handset in to be fixed, but after reading reviews from people who have had problems also, I am just going to return it for a different system."
1,Biased and trivial,"Skip this one. The author falls in love with the people who try to prevent the death penalty from ever being imposed and the book is extremely one-sided. He has no credentials, legal or other, to write on the subject and strangely, for an academic, never even bothers to try to acquire any. There are legitimate arguments for the death penalty--it is expressly mentioned in the Constitution, so it is obviously Constitutional -- as well as against it, but they are ignored, nor is any attempt made to explore the position of the victim's family, judges, prsecutors, etc.. The author spends pages describing how good looking the lawyers on his side of the issue are! No homework, no effort, no wisdom = a very trivial, tedious anecdotal meander that starts nowhere and ends up even more confused/"
4,Excellent Historical View of Events in 150 pages,"Culture and Power in England gives an excellent historical narritive of England in a rather small book. Unlike Christopher Hill's ""The World Turned Upside Down,"" it uncovers many of the less publicised points of view before the Puritain Revolution. It also goes forward to give an excellent over view of the ""Glorious"" Revolution. People looking for a wide range of issues from travel to classical literature to what was vouge will find them all in this short volume. While the field of Cultural history is still debated, this gives an excellent case for studying how people reacted to everything in their world."
4,Ghoulishly Delightful... :-),"This was a very good choice for me since I really like the Murderdolls, metal, horror flicks, and old school punk. The lyrics are really cheesy, but they are very catchy. This recording was a little bit better than the ""6 Years, 6 Feet Under the Influence"" which was re-recorded by Wednesday himself. This is a little bit harder, and more like the Murderdolls than that recording. This CD has original songs that the Murderdolls covered (Hooray for Horrorwood=Dead in Hollywood, etc). All in all, I enjoyed it very much...and I enjoy annoying my friends who don't like it. :-)"
1,NOT USEFUL FOR MOST TRAVELERS,"Not much information about what sights to see in Sydney.The DVD tries to be ""relevant"" instead of informative.It is loaded with useless questions like 'How can one have private sex in a crowded co-ed hostel?' and how can one 'pass through a metal detector if you have nipple piercings?' Its cultural information includes the revelation that beer addicted men in Sydney are 'fat from all of the ale that they drink'. The Globe Trekker Justine Shapiro solicits all of this triviality using cutesy, suggestive dialogue with the locals.Don't waste your money on this DVD."
3,"Justine is annoying, but this is an ok DVD","I agree that Justine Shapiro is the most annoying Globe Trekker host. Her comments at the hostel show that she is nothing but gutter trash. However, this is still a watchable DVD. I saw this on YouTube. The part where she climbs the Sydney Harbour Bridge alone makes the DVD worth buying. She also visits the Vietnamese part of Sydney and tries their cuisine. She interviews the Aborigines and discusses the racism they face in Australia (though things are improving). My favorite part of the episode is when she goes to the outback and sees the Kangaroos. She even eats a Kangaroo! Despite the presence of Justine Shapiro, this DVD is worth buying."
1,Don't waste your time and money on this DVD,"Of all the Globe Trekker shows, especially those done by Justine, this by far the worst episode. I'm surprised the producer even allowed this program to be aired and sold in DVD. Nothing in this episode is entertaining nor informative. Justine just goes around and conducted the most boring interviews with the most random bizarre locals. Even if I had a desire to visit Sydney before seeing this episode, Justine just ruined it."
4,Works pretty good,This works pretty good and makes no noise. The only thing is if you hit it too hard it will go right over the unit because of the steep ramp. I guess that's the challenging though. If you aim for the 1 2 or 3 the ball will stay in the tray. Can't beat it for the money.
1,"worked for only one week, then broke","This worked fine - for one week! Then it stopped working completely, for no obvious reason. So it was a waste of money for me, and I give it a poor review because it should not have broken after only one week (it was used about three times total)."
5,Does What it Should Do,"Not sure what others expected from this item, but it's exactly as described and does what is should. Take it out of the box, plug it in, putt balls into it and it returns them to you - simple.Yes it is not battery operated, but who would want one operated by batteries anyway? It has a standard cord, which is more than long enough, so no power brick. It has an adjustable return force knob which works fine. Not super accurate but not a big deal.Just like the ones I remember made years ago that every executive had in his office at work.I can't see what more you'd want for $16. Works great."
1,Awful item,I ordered one and it worked for a couple of days then made a grinding sound and burned out. Great replacement procedure from Amazon and got a second one - it didn't work at all....loser item 0 for 2.
4,Just what I needed!,"This is not the most sophisticated golf tool I ever used, but it really helped me. Four to Five foot putts use to kill me on the course. This little gadget sets in my office and I putt while on conference calls or when just trying to kill a little time. You can back up farther if you want, the ball return will send the ball quite distance, I have cut down on those short missed putts quite a lot and 2 or 3 strokes a game can make a big difference. Not to mention anytime spent getting use to your putter is time well spent."
2,Sometimes worked,"First, I ordered this without realizing it had to be plugged in instead of battery operated, this was my fault.However, after using it for a bit (who wouldn't want to use such a cool/fun purchase for putting at home) I realized the return on this putting machine was faulty about 20% of the time. It would not return balls rolled directly to the return slot, often leaving balls for me to go grab (which is against the purpose of the item itself).For this, I give it 2 stars, and would recommend looking elsewhere!"
2,Putting Partner,I purchased two. One five years ago and it works fine. The second less than a year ago which worked for 1 month. The return fails 95% of the time.jt
2,kids broke it within days,"Worked okay for a few days, sometimes the ball return wouldn't launch the ball back. Let the 4,6 and 8 year old play with it and soon thereafter it stopped working altogether. Would not buy again"
1,Overpriced Ebook Edition,"The publisher has overpriced this book into obscurity. To be realistic it should be half the price or lower. Ebook licenses are not the same as the licenses of regular books. This kind of behavior leads to pirating and the elimination of the book as a seller on the ebook trade. If not for its eprice I would rate this book a ""4,"" due only to it being a bit dry and at times (although rarely). Gabriel's sources questionable."
5,Wives & Lovers/Dear Heart Jack Jones CD,"I bought this originally for the Dear Heart album, and in my opinion, it is the better of the two. The Dear Heart album has a better song choice, although I understand that Wives & Lovers won a Grammy for Jack Jones. Jack Jones is very talented and I thoroughy enjoyed listening to his beautiful, melodic voice."
4,Music of the 60's still great,"I was a young woman when Jack Jones was at the height of his popularity. Every now and then I hear his voice and I go back to a time that was so wonderful. This LP/CDis great to listen to and it has all the songs that were hits back in the mid 60's.The arrangements by Don Costa still moves the soul. I can't say enough about ""Charade"" or ""Wives and Lovers ""or ""Toys in the Attic"" I strongly recommendthis CD because it contains most of Jack Jones hits. Enjoy and take a trip back in time when life was a little less hectic and when we had to get out of the chair to turn the LP over! EVa Velasquez"
5,Para los que gustan de la buena música,"Recién tengo este disco desde hace algunas horas y ya lo he escuchado unas tres veces. Se nota que la conjunción de estos dos grandes es muy prolífica. Hay calidad, buenas canciones y tradición. Cada uno respeta el espacio del otro como compositor e intérprete. Sin embargo, ojo, que no es para novatos ni gente que quiera salir bailando la primera vez que lo escucha. Este disco es para paladearlo y digerirlo, para ir gozando de a poco y descubriendo cada canción. Una joya de la música brasilera."
2,How somebody can screw up a good idea.,"For people who know Milton and Gil this work is pure disapointment. The impression is that a smart producer came up with the idea of doing the cd, which is in principle a good one, selected some fashionable songs and allowed them to put two or three songs that are true art. The choice of Sandy and Jr for a track is perhaps the best example of this disapointment. Don't buy this cd. There is much more quality in previous work of both Gil and Milton to be disapointed with this one."
3,no es digno de ellos,hay como 4 o 5 temas buenos y el resto.....no es digno.estos dos monstruos pueden hacerlo mucho mejor.
2,Seen better days,"Two of Brazil's MPB greats together - a match made in heaven. But the result is a bit more earthbound, alas.The album was nominated for a World Music Grammy several years back (out of loyalty to the artists, perhaps), but even the overly deferential members of the Recording Academy - who would have LOVED to honor these two honorable musicians - couldn't bring themselves to make their album the finalist.Gil is in fairly good voice in his 60's, but Milton's soaring vocal style from his youth has crash-landed in recent years. The songs don't gel, don't have any rhythmic fire beneath them.Much better to support these two by buying their earlier, more laudable career efforts."
3,Mixed bag...,"Overall, this seems rather bland. It's a step up for Nascimento, whose work is usually fairly torturous (this at least is pretty listenable...), but a step backwards for Gilberto Gil, who in the mid-1990s rebounded from a decades-long aesthetic slump and made a series of outstanding new albums. Gil's hot streak still continues, with this collaboration as sort of a mild misfire. This disc is okay, but I agree with the reviewer who said that there are better albums by both artists that you could listen to instead."
3,Doesnt completely fit,It looks good but didn't completely fit right. It looks to be of by about a half inch or so. Wouldn't be a big deal but the may has cuts in it for the airbags and those are what looks a little off.
3,No high quality,"I give 3 stars because it is CD for spanish's pop collectors and because they really made a great cover of The Kink's song ""Efecto extraño"". Most of their sons are covers of songs sung in English. Other groups like Los Mustang, Los Salvajes, Los yaki did better covers of these songs."
3,"Brazilian jazz fusion - best-of set, not an original album","Wagner Tiso ""Millennium""This is a best-of set for Brazilian jazz-fusion keyboardist Wagner Tiso. Amazon (as of September, 2008) has mistakenly linked it to the MP3 edition of his 1978 solo album, ""Wagner Tiso,"" but they are different records. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
5,Searingly honest,"Keith Dixon tackles the subjects of personal addiction, guilt and familial relations reminiscent of Hemmingway in its stark, unrelenting style.Ghostfires gives the impression that it's about the painful legacies passed down among the Bascomb men for three generations (and it is that). While that alone makes it a worthwhile read, it's reflecting on the secondar characters in the novel that make it an enduring experience.At the end, none of Dixon's characters are free from their own demons, or free from the fallout associated with their relationships with the Bascomb men.Hauntingly realistic, Ghostfires draws its strength from a near-clinical attention to the truth that leaves the biggest questions unanswered, characters unfulfilled and sense of closure unsatisfactory."
5,The Best messenger bag I've ever seen,"The whole reason that I was looking for a courier/messenger bag was because they are easy to carry, particularly for traceurs. I was drawn in by this bag's sturdy military-like design and rugged construction. I bought it somewhat tentatively and I have not looked back.I've had experiences with a wide variety of backpacks, sling bags, and messenger bags, even products by Condor. Having said that, I can say without exaggeration that this is the best messenger bag I've ever seen. I would recommend this bag to any traceur who has trained to handle messenger bags while on the run. Even though the material makes this bag a bit heavier than normal it also means that it will last and take a beating without falling apart.An excellent purchase!"
2,Shoulder Strap is too short,"The bag is nice, but the shoulder strap is WAAAAY too short. I am 6'3"" with broad shoulders and this bag rides very high up on my hip instead of at the waist or below where (I believe) it should be... necessitates removing the bag to get anything out of it. I run into this problem a lot, and honestly, would it kill these guys to make the shoulder straps 5 or 6 inches longer? I usually order custom-built replacement straps from a website, but unfortunately this one is sewn on at one end. Also, it seems to me that there is too much velcro used to hold the flap closed: 4 strips. Looks like I'll have to send it back."
2,Cheap,"This bag looks and feels cheap, nothing else to it. The plastic hardware is terrible and barely works. It is made out of a heavy canvas, but it is put together poorly and does not hold any shape. It is large and can carry a number of things. If you care at all about appearance, and are attracted by the look of this bag, don't be, save your money for something better."
5,Great chair!,"We got my five-year-old son this chair for Christmas and we got the strawberry shortcake chair for my two-year-old daughter. They love them! They are really durable too and stay inflated. They read books in them, watch movies in them and build forts with them!"
5,Very Lovely...,"I am impressed with this item. It is very lovely in person and I am positive my grandmother will adore it. The price, shipping and product are all great!"
1,This is a very biased book that misrepresents Jesus,Cottrell starts out with a strong opinion on this subject and (surprise!) makes the Bible agree with him. Do not read this if you want to wrestle seriously with difficult problems because clearly the author never doubted his own position; he both misrepresents and maligns other faithful and intelligent interpreters who disagree with his views. The way Cottrell distorts the ministry of Jesus is particularly tragic. The Jesus that Cottrell depicts brings no hope to the world; instead he reinforces the oppressive politics of his day.
1,Love the Bible (text)...but the cover...!,"I ordered the Cambridge U. Press small white NT as a confirmation gift for my parents to give my daughter and when I took the plastic wrapper off and removed the cardboard sleeve to allow them to inscribe it -- a hugely noticeable red spot on the cover! I may try this publisher's list again, but with much greater caution. I should add that the text is beautiful, even though necessarily small and the pages thin. Too bad about the poor workmanship on the cover."
1,My Man Valentine,"Kindle Customers BEWARE! 'My Man Valentine' is not part of an anthology but a single short story.As of July 19, 2010 this is falsely listed as an anthology, and pictured on Amazon Kindle as part of 'Valentine Babies'. When delivered to a Kindle device or Kindle App, only one story arrives, and the other two do not appear. Is it worth it? NO! I can not recommend that anyone buy this story, which is pathetically plotted and written, as described by another reviewer of the Kindle edition, who generously gave it two stars (overrated)."
4,A Good Anthology,"A read that is centered around Valentine's Day and babies, this was a mostly pleasing anthology for me. I'm not a fan of anthologies--stories too incomplete, rushed. Ms. Stuart manages somehow, to convey a complete romance in her story. There's a prologue that makes you wonder....an epilogue that is really cute. In between you have, as the girls call him, a ""hottie"" for a hero, and a very different heroine. Sexy, fun, and romantic...and the story makes sense. Ms. Quinn's story was my disappointment. H/h spend most of a short story, apart. And, Gabe's gift from his ""ex-wife"" made no real sense,to me. Finally, Jule McBride does a story with one of my favorite romances--friends becoming lovers. I didn't like the use of the baby, in this one. But, the story is romantic and is a good, sexy read."
4,Excellant,"A very good book, couldnt put it down, it was very , very moving to read. I love all of her books"
1,Ugh.,"People think this is good?? This 16-17 year old is singing lame lyrics about everyone in the club, blah blah, and SHE'S NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO GO A CLUB. This is like Kevin Lyttle:annoying, repetitive and supposedly ""good""- ha. ""Everybody in the club will be rocking when I'm through""- right. This is so lame. She's well known because she's pretty, something our society still can't get over. Trust me, when they get over the fact that she's nice looking, THEY WILL HATE it. This is gonna get real old,real soon. It's unoriginal, bland, and she has a terrible voice. SHe's basically whining through the whole song. Mr. DJ DO NOT play this crap"
2,Right title wrong star,"""The Wrangler"" starring Jeff Fahey was an Australian production created in 1989 directed by Ian Barry, wriiten by John Sexton and starring Jeff Fahey(Australia was till emerging from the throws of cultural cringe and importing stars rather than exporting them) and Tushka Bergen. In Australia the film was released under the title ""Minnamurra"". I agree with the previous comment in that it is the best thing I've seen Jeff Fahey do, but that isn't saying much! If you want something to pass a rainy winter afternoon, like horses and can over look some pretty ordinary acting from its stars it is worth a look for the outstanding Australian support cast. If your after the Wrangler starring Jason Evers and produced in 1960. Sorry you're out of luck here."
5,refreshing,"I enjoyed this movie because it was not splattered with sex andcursing. Tushka Bergen and Jeff Fahey worked well together.Thestory line was very good. The horse scenes and landscape wasbeautiful. Jeff Fahey was a perfect gentlemen (you don't see that much anymore,even in the movies) and I thought he did afantastic job of acting. The supporting cast was good too."
3,The Dust of The Red Road Trails,"Created as a soundtrack to a TV documentary series, ""Music For The Native Americans"" is something of a fusion album. It mixes songs from Robbie Robertson with tribal chants, song stories and atmospheric synthesizers. While the individual parts are often moving, the whole is a hodgepodge fit. Robertson may be the marquee attraction, however his vocals make up maybe half the album.That leaves others in a spotlight, and they do acquit themselves well. Rita Coolidge and her sisters perform the lovely ""Cherokee Morning Song,"" along with background vocals through-out the disc. A few of the pieces are instrumental, the best of which is the opening ""Coyote Dance."" Robertson himself contributes two dramatic vocals on ""A Good Day to Die"" and ""Words of Fire, Deeds of Blood."" This was obviously a labor of love for Robertson, and his respect for the music shines throughout the music and the collaborative efforts."
4,I've loved this forever,"I have been listening to this album since I was a little kid, for almost 15 years now. I loved it as a child; obviously as an adult I can see the flaws now, and I can hear the corniness of some of the lyrics. But I still love the music. It's very relaxing, and it's great for studying or reading to. I'm half-Cherokee, and the Cherokee Morning Song taught me my first Cherokee words. I love this album, and I'm sure you will too."
5,A Spiritual Salve,"I'm listening to this album, as I've done countless times sinceI received it a couple of weeks ago.From the first bars of Coyote Dance, to the last bars of TwistedHair, this is music that must be listened to.The subjects of the pieces themselves are not always uplifting,but that doesn't make them any less compelling, in fact more so.Thank you, Mr. Robertson, for a truly fine body of work."
3,it will work,The CD was perfectly fine. The case it was in was cracked and broke and we are unable to keep the CD in it.I did enjoy the fact the words to the songs were included in the case.
5,Absolutely one of the best recordings ever.,"If I had to choose only 5 recordings to take to a desert isle, this would be one of them. I have owned this since it was first released and each time I listen to it I am moved. This is my favorite recording of Native American music."
3,Disappointing,I'm a big fan of RR. This was disappointing for me. I should have paid closer attention to the title of this collection. I think it truly is Native American Indian fusion style music. For that it might be great - but its lost on me. Take a listen to the mp3 samples before buying the CD to ensure it's what you like.
5,"Really Special, Eclectic & Uplifting Music","Great...Great...Great...Great, Inspiring, Mesmerizing, Easy Listening and good for lifting you up without letting you down. Instead it makes you want to explore more things in your life, in a very good way. As well as, reawaken the dormant things that are beautiful in you. One cannot get tired of this CD...it's really special."
5,A pure and holy reflection,"Music For Native Americans by Robbie Robertson is some of the best and purest listening I have enjoyed in a long time. I replay it while I do my computer work in the late evenings, play it again as my ""go to dreamlend"" music, and then again in the morning when I awake. I am planning a 2600 mile road trip and this will be one of the CDs I'll use the most. It soothes, calms, and excites. Thanks, Robbie Robertson!"
5,Captures the essence,"Each track is unique. Adding the technique of recording crickets and then playing them slowed way down, creates an etherial effect. Quotes from Chief Joseph elequently kicks ass. This will always be a very special album to me."
1,incomplete information,"I was disappointed when this bottle arrived to find that the active ingredients are NSAID, commonly available, rather than ""old fashioned"" aspirin, acetysaliicylic acid."
4,Helpful,"This book has helped me out a lot through Calculus and DE courses. Detailed examples and everything you'd expect a good manual to have. It should be noted that HP has released an updated complete manual available only for download (800+ pages) that is a lot better than the original. In light of that, this book is not a nessesity but it's still nice to have for science applications."
3,Typographic problems,"I would give this book five stars, but it appears that it was printed with the wrong font, and many of the symbols in the code samples have been replaced by a small square. Although I usually can figure out what was intended, this does make the book harder to use."
2,The mixed the fun right out of it,Do yourself a favor: buy the other PSB albums instead. This album is mixed so heavily you can't even recognize most of the songs. A real dissapointment.
2,"hardcore dance music, rather than pop","This might please dance music fans, but many PSB fans are especially drawn to them because of their pop sensibilities, which are lacking in most of these remixes. Many of the remixes here sound monotonous. Some are good, but are truncated to a couple of minutes in length."
5,It is one of thier best.,This is one of my favorite P.S.B. CD's. It is definitely much higher energy then most of their material. Most of the songs (especially Absolutely Fabulous) were huge club hits back in the day. Sample it before you skip it if the you like P.S.B. with more kick.
1,SO HARD....to listen to!,"The record opens with the PSB voice singing Absolutely Fabulous, then it's NOTHING even close to what the Pet Shop Boys would put out. There were other voices NON-PSB singing ""Liberation, Liberation"" in a rap sound and it just was horrible and annoying to listen to (upbeats, but BORING). I honestly can't even determine the song from the way the remix sounds. NOTHING like the original songs and in a bad way. I'm going to dump this copy out on the net so beware if you like PSBs and don't have a lot of money to waste on it. Too bad I can't give this item 0 stars. I'd be scared to buy any of the other Disco albums PSB has put out now."
4,it's fabulous,"I don't know why this album isn't adored by all PSB fans...it is definetly my favourite and I have them all. It is a non-stop mix through all 12 tracks, each one an awesomely unique mix. Liberation (#5) is the best track on the album...one of the boys' most uplifitng tracks ever!"
4,a very well put together cd!!!,"Regardless of all the other negative remarks about this cd, I found it to be very upbeat and danceable. I bought the cd in 1994 and played it to death until it was lost or stolen. I found myself over the years since singing the tunes and bouncing around wondering if I could find this cd again. Sure enough I did and promptly got it. Now some 10 years later the tunes are as fresh as any remixes out there. I've played the cd for friends, and all have responded, ""WHERE DID YOU GET THAT...I LOVE IT!!!!"" I am a HUGE remix fan and I think this is one of the better cd's in the ""Disco"" trilogy. So my advice is, buy the cd, turn on the strobe and start dancing!!!!!!!"
3,Better if remixed by PSB themselves,"This album is worth getting if you are a die-hard PSB fan. Some songs sound great some are boring some remix had destroyed such as Liberation, a romantic love song beautifully done by PSB destoyed as a rap in the E-smooth edition. But the Vasquez and Jam and spoon to Yesterday is worth listening too. If only if it wasnt remixed beyond recognision and should've been by the PSB themself, they are good at to what they do, make good music."
4,"Katsu, you're right on!","This is not supposed to sound like a typical PSB album. It's mixed, and mixed heavily. While I don't necessarily agree with all of the track selections, this album is ne'er outdone beginning with the first mix of Yesterday, When I Was Mad. From here on this album takes on the finest of dance attributes and blows them out of your speakers. Nothing on the market was this good in 1994. Nothing."
3,Mediocre,"The ""Ab Fab"" mix is just that, darling :) This mix contains their worst ever tracks though, with ""Liberation"" leading the way. Blah :P"
4,Well....i liked it....,"Reading the supplied reviewers, you would think this was a complete waste of time. I liked it. I never got the nerve to shell out $12 for the AbFab single, so this is the only way I've heard it. I liked most of the tracks with the exception of Liberation which I think hardly needs extending. The BeatMasters remix of 'I wouldn't normally..."" is just fun."
3,Outside Angle,"Hey there ;) I want to say that I think the reason all of you ( most of you anyways ) are so harsh on this album is that you are looking at a mostly different genre of music. My exposure to the Pet Shop Boys was pretty small before I got Disco 2 -- which was the first PSB I ever had. At this point in time, I've been completely absorbed in all forms of electronic music since I was a weee pup -- including more dance side stuff, and in particual, more house-y kinds of things.In any event, I found this album to be very pleasant. It's very upbeat and fun. If you don't like the style of music, then you probobly won't like this; and from what I hear, I wouldn't buy it expecting to hear normal-sounding PSB -- after all, it *is* a remix album ;P If everyone remixed stuff in the same genre/style of music, what fun would that be?love, katsu"
3,'Good one for the treadmill or Stairmaster!,"In preparation for my gym routine, I was looking for a couple of ""tunes"" to pop in as I headed out the door. Browsing my collection, I came upon PSB's ""Disco 2"", a disc that I hadn't played in some time.Why not? Although the album was one that had remained ""dormant"" for quite a while, I loaded it in the player. As I set the Stairmaster, I also hit ""play"".Boy, did I get a workout. From the ""Absolutely Fabulous"" mix to the concluding two for ""Yesterday, When I was Mad"", I didn't misstep...not once. In fact, the person to my left started taking notice as I was humming - probably too loudly - to the ""Boys'"" singing.And the final track, ""We All Feel Better in the Dark"" allowed me to ""cool down"" after the strenuous activity.Now, it may be debated that ""Disco 2"" is not as good as the first or the third. I can't join in the discussion because I am unfamiliar with both.However, it works as a catalyst for one trying to get the bod in shape...and that's fine with me."
4,Unexpectedly good ... and absolutely fabulous!,"I was skeptical when I first bought this CD. ""Go West"" was my favorite song from the Very album, and I was hoping that the re-mix would save this CD if the other tracks were sub-par. I was deeply disappointed, however, when I heard the re-mix (track 4). I also couldn't stand the ""Liberation"" mix (track 5). ""Oh no! I was a fool to by this album,"" I thought. It wasn't until track 9 (Absolutely Fabulous mix) that the CD began to really grow on me. I absolutely love this track. Tracks 9, 10, and 11 are all great dance songs, and track 12 is the perfect way to end the album. After listening to the CD another time, I began to notice tracks 2 and 6. All these songs easily make up for my initial resentment of the album. Now, I can't get enough of this CD! Here's a little advice: For best results, listen to this album with the volume and bass turned way up! This is a great pickup for anyone searching for great Pet Shop Boys dance music."
1,Really... how can you expect to be taken seriously?,All the other reviewers have said it... and I say it too! I am a big PSB fan and I think this is the worst thing they have ever released: a non-stop sequence of lousy remixes-extracts. It all keep repeating itself. I found it so annoying that I couldn't even listen to it for more than two minutes... I just kept passing the tracks untill there were no more tracks left (laughs). Even the fans (like me) will be bitterly disappointed. Forget it!
3,Lots of experimentation,"This is not your typical worship CD. Passion, Vineyard, Hillsongs, even EWC this is not.There's a lot of experimentation here, and the results vary. ""Mercy Stands"" is great and sounds like Portishead. Did you know worship could sound like Portishead? 'Romans' opens with a didgeridoo, amongst other random sounds, and works its way into a great sort of tribal dance song. On the other hand, ""Trust the Vine"" features a white boy trying to be a black woman, and ""Prayer of St. Francis"" seems to just be weird for weirdness' sake."
1,Very Dispointing,"I have an old analog Panasonic 2.4Ghz and love it. So I didn't even think of buying another brand. This phone is terrible. She speakerphone does not work well, continually cutting in and out. The headset is even worse, the echo and digital warble are unbearable. Going to try a GE recomended from Consumer Reports."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!! WASTE OF MONEY!!,"I have never left a negative review on Amazon before, but this is a terrible phone. Sound quality is miserable as it cuts in and out as described in other reviews. Also has echo and severe static at times. I've had the phone for 5 months and the battery is already to the point where it only lasts 15 to 20 minutes after a full charge. This appears to be a problem with MANY of the panasonic phone models - just read the other reviews. Best advice is to just stay away from this brand altogether. I thought Panasonic was a quality brand; however, they have proved me wrong. I will NEVER buy another Panasonic phone again. This has been a terrible experience - worst of all, I have come to learn from other reviews that this is typical of the brand and not just a fluke as I had originally thought."
2,Boring,"My children (age 4 and 3) received this game as a gift. They were, of course, initially intruiged by the figurines. But after playing the game once they were bored. They still like the little pets but the game holds no interest for them, even though it is still new. Don't waste your money."
4,Pet Shop game,Fun to play game with grand kids. We enjoyed the challenges (which are not severe) Overall everyone enjoys playing and I think it gives nice quality time together.
4,Pet Shop Game,"My kids love LPS so I was psyched when I found a game for it! Well, it's ok. I liked that it came w/ the pet shops figures but it's not that great. The box is super flimsy and tore up after we'd used it only a few times and that stunk. It's been played with very little and I'd probably not get it again and I wouldn't get it as a gift either. It was ok for the price but they just weren't that into it."
5,The game that started it all!,I bought this game for my daughter and she still has it! She and I have played it many times! This game is simple and fun for a young child!
3,Can't quite figure it out,"I dont think this game comes with the best directions, I still have questions about how to play. Pieces appear to be durable though. If you have a child who enjoys littlest pet shop and is within the recommended age range for the game they will probably enjoy it. But you most likely wont."
5,My Daughter Loves this game,This is such a fun game. The pieces are so neat and they can play with the game pieces with other things. My daughter is 3 almost 4 and just loves playing it. I suspect she will be playing it for a long time to come as well.
3,Repetitive,"Large portions of the book are just copy-and-pasted and other sections. When it's talking about what receivers should do when coming off the LOS of scrimmage against man coverage and cover 2, two or three whole pages are just repeated verbatim.Obviously coaches are not writers, but in this case that was very obvious. The book was somewhat poorly written.Overall, this was an informative book but there are better ones out there."
5,A must have for Offensive and Defensive coaches,"This is truly a great book. Well put together in all aspects. The in depth view on quarterback mechanics, route running for recievers make this a must have. Not to mention, Mr Jenkins breaks down the west coast offense better than any book to date. He leaves room for creativity, yet it's still the same system. The call sheet in the front of the book, and the free plays in the back are definately a bonus. For you defensive coaches, the chapter on O-line protection will definately enhance your blitz preparation for any team. Not to mention, it will better help your game plan in general of how to better control the game on the defensive side of the ball."
5,I just received my copy of the second edition!,"The added chapter on installing the offense made this a great book. The offense is very easy to understand, and the forward to the book explained what a great offense this is. The practice plan was very excellent, and we are going to adopt it at my school. The completed call sheet was amazing. This is the best book on offense. I am now trying to run down his books on quarterbacks and receiver play! The new chapter was well worth buying the book again..."
5,An extreamely rare find,"This bonus edition of ""Surfacing"" was only released in Canada and only 25, 000 copies were shipped. Disc one is the regular version of ""Surfacing"" while disc two contains a jazz version of ""Sweet Surrender"" (Sarah's voice has never been better on this version) and Sarah's interpretation of ""The Prayer of Saint Francis"". Good luck trying to find it!"
4,Great,"Although there are several variations to this song, each one making it less and less listenable and significant, Road Trippin' is a beautiful track that comes off crisp and clean. Without any form of percussion, it soars melodically and freely, giving it a new feeling that the Chili Peppers have not yet provided. The lyrics are paired flawlessly with the guitar, which is played with perfection. A real gem among rocks.As always, the live performances of the Chili Peppers are always amazing and never lacking in love, energy, and awe. ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"", a song rarely played on a live set, is great, and giving off just over-the-top perfection. ""Californication"" has been played better numerous times, making this version rather disappointing. Of course, ""Under the Bridge"" always proves to me a moving experience, booming with emotions and blossoming into a beautiful full fledged ballad of amazements.Recommended--rare."
3,"Okay, but not great","House of Whispers has potential. It's supposedly takes place in the 20th century, but at times I couldn't tell if it was set in the 50's/60's or 20's/30's or even the 19th century. I would have liked a little more complexity to the story and more depth to the characters. I didn't like when there was almost a whole page of Italian or French and no translation....it may work in a movie, but not in a book....at least in my opinion.I found I was just reading the book to get to the end. I only stuck with it to find out what possibly could have caused the heroine such trouble. I felt the story dragged in some parts and then rushed together in the last 5 chapters when the author realized he needed to end the book. I'm just glad it was a free book.There is another copy of this book with a 2004 copyright. This review is at both, but this is the copy I downloaded on my Kindle. Formatted for Kindle just fine."
3,Interesting and compelling,"I just finished this book, and found it to be very interesting. Margolis details a significant and observable difference between scientific discovery prior to 1600 and then afterwards.Essentially, he determines that early followers of Copernicus (ie, Galileo, Kepler, Stevins, and Gilbert) used 'around the corner' investigation to explain and discover scientific principlals that had evaded discovery for two thousand years.Critic of the ""Scientific Revolution"" assert that nothing fundamentally changed with Copernicus, and Margolis makes a strong arugument that their investigation and conclusion are flawed.This is a solid book, and is organized in a logial and clear manner."
4,What a twist at the end!!!,"This was a terrific character study, as well as some action as well. The twist at the end was totally unexpected, but looking back, one could see how it was going to that. I really liked the movie because it has a very young Adrian Paul (better known for his Highlander role, Duncan MacCleod); only a bit part, and a bad boy at that. Very good movie!"
3,GREAT FLICK!!!,"This movie is great on two levels: 1) The story is a bit far- fetched, but it is believable due some fine acting. The stars work well together to turn this into an enjoyable movie.2) Daphne Zuniga gets naked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good product!,The only part I didn't like was the ebolems on the sides were stickers and I thought they would be painted on. So hopefully they don't peel up because thats the whole reason to get the custom hard hat!
4,Memory sequence (harp playing),"Do you remember where you were, in what grade you were, or what you were doing when you first heard ""Going In Circles"" a teenage girl of the 60's love anthem? How about the theme song of President Obama's election, ""At Last"" by Etta James? Those and more will take you back to an easier place in time...SIGH...I'll have to look for Volume 1."
5,"naja, es macht spass.","I own this album and I like it...I'm a German Lit scholar who grew up in the 1980s, so I still have a soft spot in my heartfor whacky German/Austrian Pop music...Falco, Kraftwerk,Nena(99 Luftballons), and more recently, Die Fantastischen Vier,whose _Vier Gewinnt_ I bought during my year-long sojourn in Germany as an exchange student in college (1992-93).When I taught High School German a few years back the kidsgot a kick out of Falco and all these Austro-German ""oldies"".All this music makes me want to put on my glasses, dress a black turtle-neck with black pants and prance like Dieter ;-)This CD has most of Falco's major stuff. The version of ROCK ME AMADEUS is fine...like other reviewers I prefer the U.S. version, but this one's fine.Es Lebe Falco!"
3,Falco Greatest Hits ??????,Its a early 80's C/D.Songs are in French so one cannot understand them. Good version of Amadeus....
3,Sorry to hear this isn't truly his greatest hits.,"Reading some of the other reviews, I feel slighlty cheated. I've always found Falco an inventive and truly original artist who could make a wacky pop homage to Mozart memorable, reaching out to the rest of the world from Vienna and was not afraid to stay true to his roots. Just listen to the ""falco, you are wonderful"" line on ""America."" This guy was having a good time.I was disheartened to read that this was a less than representative collection of the artist's work. For a casual fan like me, this works out OK, but now I'll probably have to search out some of his other work to get a better appreciation for this artist's legacy. Now, if I could only sprechen sie deutsch."
2,rather disapointed,"as a huge 80s and falco fan, this disc let me down. only a couple of the song sound like i rememberd hearing on the radio. you might be better off buying a diferent falco album, like falco 3. when i was a kid in the 80s i fell in love with ""rock me amadeus"" and that song is ok, but the komisar doesnt sound right, and the remix at the end has nothing of the origional songs apeal."
3,Good music,"I enjoyed FALCO many years ago on audiotape. The sound is actually clearer and crisper on the CD than I remember from the tape. I enjoy the beat and background very much, but inadvertently ordered the German version, so I have a little difficulty with the words. Nonetheless, FALCO arrived in great shape, and holds a spot in my music library."
4,Falco-Greatest Hits,Great Album. All the original 'Falco' hits-to be enjoyed by the fans! I like the Rock me Amadeaus version!Der Kommisser is fantastic. If you like Falco I highly recommend this album-you will enjoy!
5,Good Information,"I am writing a term paper on the Gulf War and even though you can have up to 5 sources this is basically the only book I need! It has everything I need to know! If you are doing research like myself, I suggest you check it out!"
4,Great,"This was a good book that has lots of unexpected turns. All of the Phantom Stallion books keep you on the edge of your seat. This is a great book, but I reccomend you start with the first book if you're going to read this series."
5,Good,"I loved the book. I really liked how Sam was in charge of something so big. I liked who a new horse comes in every story and how most of the time a new character comes in, too. I also like how the story is on mainly horses and it stays on them and the other people in the story. One thing that i really like about the book is that there aren't a thousand different characters and that there are some and they keep talking about those characters."
5,Sleepy,Please right more of them I really love them. Also the Thoroughbred books are really good. But I like all of the books.Keep it up Terry. Keep up the reading and the writing revouws People.
2,Disappointed. Not worth the money,The bins in this hamper at too small to use as a hamper for more than one person. Each been holds 1/4 - 1/3 of a load of laundry. Also there are no air holes for ventilation. I regret buying this item.
3,Nice and small.,"This hamper assembles just like most IKEA furniture, though it does seem heavier and nicer quality. It looks just like the picture in terms of style. However I have to agree with other reviewers who were disappointed in how small this thing is. I really wanted a three compartment laundry bin that didn't look cheap or industrial. While this fits those requirements, it is so small, I can't decide if I should just go with a larger but not as pretty option. Maybe I'll just get a second one of these.To repeat and summarize, this thing is pretty and well made, but very small."
3,Beautiful but SMALL,"This is a beautiful piece and the wood is nice and heavy, but the baskets where the cloths go is SUPER tiny. A pair of my husbands jeans, 1 of his sweaters and maybe a tshirt or 2 and it was full...not even 1/2 a load."
5,Returner rocks!,This is a great single and the music video that comes with it is spectacular! Gackt never disapoints!
5,Francis Funnybones.,"Remarkable names of Real People is what it says: John Train, a New York-based investment counselor who travelled the globe. When away, he went to the phone book and found real names like Positive Wassermann Johnson, Suparporn Poopattana and T. Hee.Norman Cousins discovered that crazy movies will help you heal faster after surgery. This book is in the same category. If you want to laugh, read Remaarkable Names of Real People. It's out of print so thank goodness Amazon sells used books for only, here's a grin, a penny.Don MangesPittsburgh"
3,I really want to give 3.5 stars,"This is book is technically ok, but it doesn't tell you anything you haven't learned if you have taken a photography course. So I guess if you have have never take a photography course in your life, it would be great book for you, but otherwise its only going to tell you tips that your instructor has probably already told you."
5,photo tips,"Small book with large ideas to take better pictures. Simple instructions, many examples make it an easy, very helpful read."
1,Waste of your life....,"This book was so disappointing, after page 25 I realized the theme, that I was not learning anything. It was mindless coffee table scanning. It teaches you nothing. One buys a book for growth, yet with this book, all you have to do is skim the 100 titles and you get the point. He could have just typed them on one piece of paper! It was a waste my time/life reading as much as I did. No f stop info, shutter speed used. All he provided was mm distance from subjects! -I don't even want it in my house. How does one resell on Amazon?!?"
4,Bleeding Partition and Not A Nice Man To Know,"Such a story, such a picturisation, such a masterpiece, well, it's an eye opener to the tragic experience of Partition to all of us who are born after the partition of India and Pakistan. Neverthless, could we have been able to feel the pain and agony of partition or a clear picture of it. Actually, I felt it in my blood with those events described by our octogenarian Khuswant Singh. It's only those who have eyewitnessed the partition, who can tell such a touching story. Well, the role of Juggat is marvellous. Though a disturbed and a naughty fellow in the eyes of the people, he does have a humane heart inside and that's what counts in the end.No matter what you are, it's your inner self what counts in the end.Thanks Khushwant Singhji, I was, am and will be your ardent reader along with millions.Thank you. Rupesh"
1,Do not waste your time,This book is a complete waste of time. The author shoud have this book a fiction and it would have worked.
5,Outstanding Novel,"This book gives us gripping information about what all these people went through during Partition and how a nation was torn apart. It is an important part of history that few of us knew about.Now I have found many books and films that tell the story, but this was the first one I read and it's a keeper....very well done."
4,Excellant presentation of impact of Partition,"Brilliant presentation of the impact of the partition of India and Pakisthan. In this country partition is viewed far more bloody than any other event recorded in the history because it not only partitioning people but their relation, friendship, love and affection - the one ness. Division on sectarian basis can never reach a good ends and the picture of such violent attempt was here. People who has nothing to do with politics, sectarianism develop disrespect, enemity on each other for factors that are not concerning them in their limited lives. Presented with exceptionally realistic charecters and great story craft to take the reader from one end to the other, this is one of the excellant works by an Indian writer in English I have ever read."
3,A glimpse at what was,"A well written novel of a little town caught between receiving train loads of corpses and understanding what the partition meant to them. At times, meandering about, but by and large, I found the novel to be good reading."
4,An advertising communication reference book,"This is not a textbook and it offers not many concepts. Most of the time it illustrates the cases with Coca-Cola. Anyways, this book places emphasis on the integrated market communications revolution and reflects the integration of mainstream advertising with corporate communications, direct-response advertising and promotions. It has a strong managerial and applied emphasis. Not bad to take a glimpse."
1,Another dusty text,"A proper assortment of vacuities, false academisms, and funny logic (e.g., you are offered a choice of direct (sic) advertising, which simply states the advantages of a product, or ""an interesting creative idea"", thus suggesting that these two notions are incompatible.) It goes without saying, that the book (like all ivory-tower books, Cannes, etc.) mostly talks about Coca-Cola and other products that could fare perfectly all right with just some reminding advertising. No murmur of launch ads, high technologies, cross-cultural marketing and other ""dangerous"" topics. Perfect reading for insomnia cases."
1,Juan y Junior,How I suppose to give you a review without a list of songs ? Also I am very interested to buy this CD but there is no information available.
1,Dissatisfaction,"I was unaware when I bought this phone that it required three small batteriesin order to operate, and that the batteries would need changing within a period of three months or less. Also, following the directions carefully, I was unable to program successfully the push-buttons that call selected numbers. I will not ever use this phone. It was a waste of money. (I bought it because this model has the feature that allows the use of a headphone.)"
2,Very Disappoited,"I received this phone and thought it would work with our current phone system. It did not. Although the phone probably works fine, I requested to return the phone 3 times!!! I have not had a response as of yet. Poor customer service from this company!"
4,Phone Review,"We needed a speaker phone for the office with no voice mail requirements. This does the trick and the price was right. No problems, no complaints. Volume control, mute, and speed dial, all the buttons work as advertised."
4,Great deal,The price was right and the phone does what it promises to. the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the volume when using a headset with it could stand to be a little louder.
3,works fine and is convenient,"phone works fine as does the speakerphone function. Will be interested to see how long the battery charge for the speakerphone lasts, however. Jon."
2,Almost a Good Phone....,This started off being a great phone but the handset stopped working!! I have read reviews concerning the speaker phone going out but it still works...wish the handset would work...
5,cheap and quality!,"Panasonic seems to have a knack for making stuff that just works and is high quality. This is another fine example.It's compatible with Plantronics headset lifters, bonus."
5,"Panasonic Speakerphone, great item","We needed a speakerphone and found this on the internet, it has a great quality, it is simple enoughtthat everyone could handle it and the qualityis great, we can hear it very well. It is a great telephone,we even thought of buying a second one of this kind."
1,The phone is defective and being returned.,"I wanted and got a light weight phone with a low profile, adjustable volume, mellow ringer, mute button, and speed dialing.I settled for a unit lacking an included headset and lacking caller id. However, I need a phone that works and this one doesn't. A defective phone is probably a fluke but when this one came in, I trashed my dropped-once-too-often phone and I just can't take the chance."
1,Disconnects,Product is no good. A lot of interference and disconnections. Don't buy. I'm sending mine back this week. Waste of money.
4,Works fine except for speakerphone,"The phone works just fine...I havent bothered to try any of the memory buttons or anything like that...I just have it at my desk to make a few calls via VoIP.My only pet-peeve is that , to get the speakerphone to work, you need to lift the handset to get dial-tone, then press 'speakerphone' button...my old phone (att cl2939) allowed you to just press the speakerphone button and start dialing."
2,Disappointing,The speakerphone is awful. Breaks up and is tinny. Not acceptable for my use so it's going back. It's a shame because otherwise this would be a winner.
5,Phone,Great phone! Perfect for my business needs! Works great with a headset! I would recommend this phone! Great product! Great price!
4,Ok!,The phone its self is a pretty good phone. I have had some problems with the headset jack. The jack is making my headphones distort really bad. I don't know if its my headset or the phone. The phone does take batteries for the speaker phone and headset. If you don't have the batteries in the speaker phone and headset won't work. All the other features on the phone is good. You can hear perfectly clear on the phone when you are making phone calls. The speaker phone is awesome. You can be 4 ft. away and the person on the other end can hear you perfectly clear. Once I get the distortion problem figured out and if its not the phone. Then it would be the perfect phone.
1,Weak Corded Speakerphone,"It was a nicely designed, simple to operate, speakerphone. I really wanted it to work, BUT:1) every time I moved my hand toward the speaker (while it was in use) the speaker squealed, rather like hearing aid feedback and,2) the microphone pickup was weak - many people on the other end of the line asked us to speak louder so they could hear us.Amazon replaced it once and problem #1 mostly disappeared, but problem #2 remained.I returned to my antique ATT Model 854 four-line speakerphone (even though I use only one line) because the speaker is loud and the microphone is strong. I can HEAR AND BE HEARD via the speakerphone from two rooms away! Its only drawback is that it requires 120 v power and would not work in a power outage."
3,OK if you don't need speakerphone,I work from home and use a phone all the time for my work. I saw the review about need for batteries for speaker phone(Which I use exclusively) I bought this anyway due to the price with such good reviews. I put normal batteries in and within 5 days my speaker phone needed more!I had to finish the day using the handset. So then I purchased very expensive long lasting batteries and so far haven't needed to replace them but now have extra batteries by my desk. I have a feeling the cost and frustration for batteries will override what otherwise is a good basic phone.
1,"Runs on batteries, bad for headsets","First of all, I had all kinds of headaches finding a headset for this device. The reason I bought this is because it has a headset jack and it is corded (rules for the kind of job I do). However, it was impossible to find a headset that worked with it. Not even the ones from Panasonic worked. The issues varied from the device being incompatible with cordless headsets to the jack being too small for the corded ones - and even with an adapter, you can either only hear OR only speak from your headset, never do both. So, when I gave up on trying, after purchasing so many different headsets and adapters just to have to return them, I considered keeping the device as an extension, because it is fairly cheap. But then I realized it only runs on batteries, you can't get energy from an outlet or anything. That is kind of too much trouble for such a simple device. Having to replace or recharge batteries for this is just a waste of time. I finally decided to return it."
1,120 days,"120 days later the dialing function no longer works. Very poor quality construction. Too bad, this was a nice phone initially."
2,Can't be used in business,I had to return it back. Buttons were not working and the sound was very low even when put on maximum. Same applies on the headset.
4,Panasonic Business Phone,This phone works perfect for my job as a 'telecommuting' customer service/sales agent! There is an accessory port on the side to plug in my headset and I just press the speaker button to answer my calls. The sound quality is good. This was a big money saver as the professional head-set type phones are 3 times this price!
4,Great phone for the price,I like this phone because it has a plug in for a headphone which I also purchased from Amazon and I can use it without holding the receiver. The only flaw that it has is that it does not have a caller ID display.
4,Good Product,"This phone has worked well over the last month since I purchased it. The memory dialer is easy to use and program. The speakerphone is clear and easy to understand. I was looking for a phone to replace an older AT&T; brand phone with similar features, and this was the closest I could find. It is getting harder and harder to find nice corded phones with so many folks switching to cell phones only.The only negatives are that the phone requires batteries for the functions and it would be nice if caller ID was included."
1,recieving party cannot hear you well when using speaker,unless you are very close to microphone and speak loudly party cannot hear you well at all.
2,The Bad One of the Bunch,"I must have gotten the bad one in the bunch. When using the speakerphone, I could hear just fine, but the person on the other end could not hear me. Same when using a headset. Since I bought it primarily for those two features, I ended up returning it and purchasing another Panasonic. Thanks to Amazon for the effortless return process."
4,Good simple phone,"Phone is exactly as advertised (can you ask more) I am hard of hearing in the upper tones and wear top line Aids. I went through 12 different hard wire speaker phones to find this the only one that does not ""mush"" up or overload my hearing in the speaker phone mode."
2,Defective after two weeks,I bought this phone as a quick setup to my working from home job. It worked great for the first week no problems to speak of at all. Now I am in week two and the phone doesn't register that I have hung up the handset so I am constantly getting an annoying beeping coming from it because it didn't hang up all the way. Because of this I couldn't connect to the software I needed to in order to work. Just because you need a quick startup don't buy a cheap phone like this. It backfired on me completely!
5,"Wonderful, inexpensive and does all you ask of it!",Wonderful phone. An inexpensive item with easy to use functions. It has a speakerphone and automatic one-button dialing for programed names.
3,"ok, not great phone","not very impressed. the keys stick, and the speaker phone does not go on unless you are on a call. should be able to hit the speaker key and the phone goes on automatically."
2,flawed phone,"My phone works OK until I use a headset, which is unfortunately why I bought it. Then it refuses to hang up completely. It hangs up, but then gets a dial tone even though I have pressed the headset button to disconnect. My old ATT phone worked much better."
4,Nice and Big and Easy to Use,This is a nice phone and I had to buy them for the headphone set I ordered earlier. THe speaker phone is very nice feature and I have had no problems with the phone so far.
4,What I liked and didn't like,"This receiver replaced an equivalent Panasonic that was almost 20 years old. It was every bit as good as it's elder with one exception.THE OLD ONE HAD AN LCD THAT READ THE TIME OF DAY WHEN IDLE, THE PHONE NUMBER DIALED WHEN IN USE AND THE NUMBER OF MINUTES THE CALL HAD BEEN ACTIVE.TRY AS I DID, I COULD NOT FIND THE SAME FEATURES WITHIN ANY BRAND.You would think that in this space age of telephones that Panasonic would have added the incoming telephone number as well. Instead they subtracted features.One the other hand, what is has is excellentG Abelson"
3,Panasonic Phone,I like the clear sound. I hate the bulkiness considering you have to use the headset with it. I also wish that it could be answered with the speakerphone button while in use with the headset. It would have made my job easier.
3,Good as a phone but not so good with headset.,"The phone seems to be of high quality and I am pleased. I purchased the phone specifically to be used with a headset. The way that the phone works with the headset was not disclosed correctly. I expected to plug in the headset and be able to choose from among the following conditions: Headset,handset,speaker phone. The phone does not work like this. The headset has to be physically disconnected from the phone to return to the handset/speaker phone condition. This makes it difficult to answer the phone using the handset and then attaching the headset to be used. While using the headset the people on the other end had no problem talking with me so it worked fine."
5,Panasonic KX-TS105B,"i purchased 2 of the Panasonic business telephones. So far they are working perfectly i have had no problem. I was skeptical because the price was really low compared to the other phones that i looked at. I have a beauty salon so we take a lot of calls. No complaints, and it got here super fast with the free 2 day shipping"
4,Have Used it Over 3 Years - No Problemo,"This is a good, basic phone which I've used over 3 years with no problems. I don't need to use most features, but I can say the speakerphone and headset work well. My only complaint is the cord on the handset is too short (and I don't care enough to replace it). Also I wish it had caller-ID (I attached a third-party device to it)."
2,Read before buying,"Upon first glance this phone looks great for work applications, but beware. This phone uses batteries instead of a outlet for its power. So, if your going to use it for work and you need the headset, you have to rely on the two AA batteries. And they dont last long believe me. If you have to have it for work, buy a phone that has a standard power supply."
1,"If You Like Being Randomly Disconnected, Get This Phone","I've had this phone for a year. I use it to work from home, and some nights I am on this phone for 4+ hours straight as I am logged into a computer system. It was working fine for months, but now it seems to be reaching the end of its rope. After just ONE YEAR. Apparently, this phone is no longer able to function that long without disconnecting at some point during my call shift. Very frustrating. I've tried contacting my carrier, replacing the cords, but no... it's the phone. This phone just isn't working that well anymore. If you're looking for longevity and/or will be using this phone a lot for work purposes, LOOK ELSEWHERE."
5,Excellent Basic Speakerphone,"This is an excellent basic speaker phone. I was looking for a speaker phone powered by the phone line which would, therefore, work during a power outage. I also wanted a jack for a headset. This phone is easy to use and the quality of the sound is good. There is no AC power required. I have not bothered to install the battery backup; for basic operation, including the headset and speaker phone, you don't need it."
4,Works fine,No bones about it. It's a phone and it works as intented. It's also sleek. I use it as my business line and the speakphone is great.
2,Corded Phone Review,"The phone was not user friendly. When installing, never got a dial tone after several tries. Still have not gotten it to work. Might return it soon."
3,Panasonic Business Phone,"Batteries are required to use this phone and there is no caller ID.It's a great basic business phone which I purchased to use with the Plantronics headeset system.It meets my needs, but I wish it had caller ID."
2,Low Tech Phone,"The Panasonic phone was purchased as I needed a hard-wired phone in case of a power failure. Its a rather primitive phone lacking caller id; but after all, what do expect for $29. It has a speaker phone and you can store 12 numbers. It has variable ring as well speaker phone volume control. If you don't need caller id but want a hard-wired phone, for $29 this one will do fine."
4,I use this phone a lot,"I needed something for ""work from home"" that would allow me to use a direct connect headset. I wanted simple and this is it - Plug the headset into the side and push a button. No need for batteries, just an old fashioned phone jack to power it.No need to take the phone off the cradle, just hit the headset button to pickup or hangup. Mute button works great."
3,Panasonic Integrated Business Phone (KX-TS105B),"The phone is very good and works well for my needs. The only thing that gives me pause is the earphone jack, sometime there is static and I have to twist it on occasion. I'm going to buy another earphone to see if that's the problem."
1,"Sound quality bad, refurbished replacements.","The phone had the feature I needed for my work - the headset jack with the ability to switch back to handset when needed. Unfortunately after about three months, the sound quality went waaaay downhill and even switching to handset didn't help - the echo and horrible static remained. Plus sometimes the phone would ""pick up"" the line without me pressing the button - I would come up to the phone after not being near it for hours and hear a long ""beeeeeep"" through the headset.I contacted Panasonic and got a replacement phone, which they said had to be a refurbished one. The second phone had the exact same problem.I sent it back and (half a month after they received it) still am waiting for the replacement (after my very firm insisting they agreed to send a different model, alas, also refurbished). I'll most probably sell this phone and get another one instead. I don't think I trust Panasonic anymore. Not with phones, at least."
2,Speaker Phone doesn't work well,"I got this phone to replace an AT&T phone that has a very poor speaker phone. Unfortunately this one is not much better. You have to yell when only three feet away from the phone for the other person to hear you. Also, the max volume on the specker phone is not all that loud. Why can't they make a speaker phone that works that doesn't cost a hundred dollars? The speaker phone on cell phone work better (much better) than this one. Maybe they have to plug into an electrical socket to get enough power. This one runs on three AA cells."
4,only one issue,"If you have a headset connected, then the only thing you can use to talk is... the headset. When a headset is connected, I would love to have the option to also use the handset. How?... if I pick up the handset, then I should be able to use it and have the headset bypassed. This way, if I am working and the phone rings, I would quickly pick up the handset (the headset takes forever: finding the headset, untangling the cable, put it on, pick up the call), and, if the call will take longer, then I could put on the headset while talking on the handset.Anyway, just a minor thing, I believe."
2,I love these...,"They are all a nice ""golden"" color as in all of them are bronzed instead of like many where the 1E-4G are bronze and 5b+6e aren't... So they look good.Sound is great. Lot of oomph.So why the low rating you ask? Well...The amount of strings are ridiculous... I know that there are many kinds of acoustic guitars but when I trim off over eight inches of string... Thats just to much for me I guess. Not to mention how hard the extra length makes it to wind...Also the packaging, be carefull when you take these out, they are in little envolpes three in all (1e+4D 2b+5A 3g+6E) however you can't pull out one without the other.How is that bad? Well they didn't ""wind"" them if you will so you now have three feet of wire unraveling itself where ever you pull them out of. All in all a great set just badly... designed I guess."
4,wonderful character-driven film,"This movie is probably not for all tastes, but it was definitely for mine. It is an investigation of the way our opinions about others are very often based upon their tastes, whether about lifestyle, music, humor, or art. The main character Castella's transformation from ignorance to interest is fascinating and sweet. Highly recommended for those who love nice slow character movies."
2,rather dull for all the attention it supposedly got,"not sure what the hoopla was about, this film is neither funny nor insightful.maybe something earth shattering happened in the last 1/2 hour because i fell asleep. movie drags."
2,A Cure for Insomnia?,"This is one of those movies that starts out slow, and generally stays that way until the bitter end. I must say that the music was the high point of this film for my wife and me, although the dog gets good marks for biting the actors. Why movies such as this get any nods for Academy Awards nomination I'll never know. But hey, it sets the tone for a good night's sleep!"
5,Exquisite,"I saw the Taste of Others in the theater and it was simply exquisite. I haven't enjoyed a film as much as this one in years. All of the acting is very strong, the character development is subtle and intelligent, and throughout the film good taste reigns, without any of the banal excesses that film-makers so often resort to.I can hardly wait until it comes out on DVD so I can watch again!"
5,proud,This is an album and artist sure to be missed by the states which is sad. Heather Small is unique to her own and will hopefully become noticed like the true talents that are so easily overlooked. She has a voice of true emotion. one of the best album of the year.
5,Inspirational and moving,"Wow! What a great voice and starting with the title track that knocks on the door of your soul, with What have you done today to make me proud? <whew> She continues and each of the tracks challenges you to the limits of Positive Mental Attitudes. Can't wait for more material from this great artist.A must buy!"
2,Not the item we ordered,"Althought we did get an authentic 12 inch G.I. Joe it was not the ""Marine Sniper"" as pictured or as noted on the order. However, the seller ""Starselling"" has given us a discount since that item is no longer availabe."
3,"Better off getting ""What Hits?"" instead","This is a budget compilation of early RHCP hits from the 80s, but all this material is also on the ""What Hits?"" CD which also includes many more tracks. ""What Hits"" is so readily available used cheaply (Amazon currently has sellers listing it for $0.01 at the time of this review) that it makes no sense to buy this compilation instead.What Hits!?"
3,Don't waste your money,"This compilation sucks. It's got three hits: ""True Men Don't Kill Coyotes"";""Behind The Sun"";and ""Higher Ground"" is okay, I guess, but it's only got ten tracks and all seven others suck. How can you call a ten-track disc a ""compilation"", a greatest hits one at that. Besides, where's ""Dani California"" and ""Can't Stop"". $5.00 isn't bad, but this album could use much work. Buy The 2003 Greatest Hits collection with the lips on the front cover, or ""Stadium Arcadium"", just anyone but this. Save the $6.00 and use it for a quart of Orange Juice or a candy bar or something, just not this ""album"". I've changed my mind 2.5 stars"
2,"Long on words, short on substance","I've read the majority of Grimes' books, including several non-Jury ones and, actually I was quite disappointed with this one. It's long (over 400 pages) and tends to plod meandering between Jury, Plant, Wiggins, the inimitable Cripse family, but to me never really goes anywhere to adding to the story or, importantly, its resolution - more little vignettes of peoples lives rather than mystery tale. Naturally, there's Jury's ongoing personal dilemma of being constantly without female companionship and far too much time wasted on his self-analysis of quitting smoking, while other characters bog down the story with equal non-relevant issues.The crimes are resolved over the final ten or so pages, with the previous text not really factoring into the story at all. I would have to say, not one of Ms. Grimes better efforts."
1,One Star for the Cripse Kiddies.,"They were the only interesting characters in this entire mess, and the only reasons I even bothered with this book were because I liked the audio narrator, Donada Peters, and to find out what happened to Mary Dark Hope's sister Angela after reading Biting the Moon--a much better and surprisingly loathed book than this one--first. This boring, outdated British storyline only goes to show that you can't judge an author solely on one project. I loved its aforementioned successor and totally despised this boring slop. Oh, well, at least the Cripse kiddies made me laugh."
3,Travelogue or Mystery?,"This is the second Grimes book I've read (both Richard Jury mysteries). I found the plots, with various twists and turns, to be believable and entertaining. The characters are well defined and easy to relate to, and there is good humor interspersed.However, what I didn't like at all were the interminable descriptions of landscapes, scenes, even a cat! I also find Ms. Grimes' use of obscure/big words mildly irritating.If all the excess verbage could be eliminated, I'd say these would be page turners. As they are, it's almost a chore to pick them up."
3,Really,"They are condoms, need I say more!?!I kind of have to fill out the rest of this with words though."
4,Every High School Student Should Read This,"When this anarchistic and mind-expanding book came out in 1970, I was a sophomore in high school. The very EXISTENCE of a book with such a title was a threat to the authority of my administrators and teachers. I wrote a report on it for my English class and got a nice grade, but my teacher was nervous about a book that questioned almost every foundation of what she and her peers and I and my peers were doing every day from 8 to 3.Is the book still relevant? Since such diatribes and manifestos are always instructive, I'd say yes-- though much dated, the basic paradigms of American education are still just as hidebound and conformist as they were 40 years ago.I hope that today's brighter students will pass this around as we did in samizdat form. Even if Farber's sometimes heavy-handed jeremiad rolls off the rails frequently, it provides enough of a jolt to justify its continued perusal by a new generation."
4,every teacher should read it,"controversial, in your face. take the book for what it is worth, it has some very insightful persepectives on the education system. a good laugh as well."
2,Looked Good....,"I bought it because of a prior experience with a panasonic phone. I loved it, had it for almost six years(which isn't bad for a 900 mghz).This one looked good, the auto scan, speaker phone, nothing too fancy, but after 2 months reception is lousy,tried all suggestions, moved phone to every jack in my house, no improvement. Very disappointed."
3,Wrong at the first sight!!,I have to correct the previous reviews (I accidently enterred twice reviews). This phone was perfect until my husband pointed out that the voice is not as clear as the other panasonic phone we had. I compared both phones and found the voice quality is not so good!! I was very disappointed about this!......
3,No Istanbul!,"This was actually made in 1997.How can you make a tour of Turkey and not see Istanbul? Well that's what this video does. It also doesn't go to Pamukkale's hot springs, another must see spot for tourists.What it does include is great coverage of Ephesus, shows you what a Turkish bath is like, how to buy a Turkish rug, highlights of all the cheap hotels and transportation she uses. This video visits unknown cities not on your usual tourist route. So you get a feel of the culture as the traveller talks with local people and attends a wedding in a small village.Supplement this video with Rick Steves' Travel the World Eastern Cities for great coverage of Istanbul. Includes visits to the Topkapi palace, the Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia, the bazaar, a Turkish bath house, a boat ride and a view of modern Istanbul."
1,Terrible paraphrasing of religions.,"It is old and probably the worse telling of religions I have ever read in my life. Gaer's retelling of the Christian faith and the Reformation is just awful, he says that Joseph and Mary taught their kids (including Jesus) the BIBLE. I am pretty sure Jesus Christ wasn't studying a Bible. Not once is there a citation of where he received his information. He starts the book off with how he thinks the religions began and then he use's weak points to tie all religions together. I haven't studied some of the religions he talks about too much, but the religions I have studied, he butchered the storys to death. All in all if you want to waste your life reading outdated and inaccurate information go for it. But if you want to make use of your life pass on this rubbish."
5,Filter cartridge,"Hey they are filter cartridges, same as you can buy at the store only cheaper and at your door. I am interested though in using the refillable trays and cutable filter pad. I've purchased them, once I run out of cartridges I will give them a try."
4,"Great product, if you can handle the price","I've been using these in my penguin filter for years. They do a great job, but are on the expensive side. I have two filters that each take two of these cartridges, so I have 4 in use at any given time. I alternate changing two cartridges out at a time and rinsing the other two to get rid of most of the accumulated gunk. This saves some money and also preserves more of the beneficial bacteria that grows on the filter media."
5,Always gonna need filters,"I can't find this product locally anywhere near the price, and they deliver it to my door, how can you go wrong."
3,"Works, but still have issues","These work, however because the directions were poor and we didn't know much about them, it took a while to figure them out. We also had to buy extra filter charcoal because they weren't working quite good enough."
5,"Great quality filters, super easy purchase","Great quality product without the hassle of trying to find the right size filter in the store. It keeps our tank clear and clean, even when we forget to change them regularly."
5,Excellent value,Excellent value for product. Cheaper than buying in stores.almost half price (even when factoring in shipping cost!!!)EXACT SAME PRODUCT SOLD IN STORES
4,Worth the price,"A good replacement to the cartridges that came with my filter-and-pump system, I'm using 4 cartridges at a time and the water is crystal-clear."
4,"As expected, no fuss no muss!",We have the Marineland 400 filter system for our 55 gallon tropical freshwater aquarium. These cartridges are recommended for our filter and work great. Very easy to use and switch out.
3,Not again until real page #'s are added,"It is very convenient to be able to have heavy book text in a lightweight reader. It is very inconvenient to have purchased a textbook for my Kindle that I can't follow page numbers on especially in the middle of class and my professor says ""Go to page..."" and then I just have to flip or do a word search for the section in order to get there and be able to follow along. I will not be purchasing another textbook for my kindle if it doesn't have the real page numbers, even if it means multiple pages on the Kindle having the same page number as the text. There are also a few places where the text is smashed together."
2,"Seriously, not written for the student but for the professor","Okay, so I rented this book because this is the text my professor picked. It was ""easy to read"" I suppose, if all you have to do is read it. But if you want to study, the index is pitiful and it's very hard to relocate the theories without highlighting it. Since I rented this book, I was hating it with a purple passion before midterm. It was only an 8 week class, so that should tell you something.If all you want to do is read it, great, this is your banana. But if you have to study from it, because you are a student and not the professor, go ahead and buy it. The pleasure you will get from burning it after the class is over will outweigh the extra expense."
2,Terrible,"I went to read chapter 2, and the book didnt have pages between 18-62. NOT OK! My teacher had me make copies in the library, which costs money! Lose lose situation here.."
2,a little more consideration for rentals,i dislike the fact that the book is highlighted and written on. the wear of the book is acceptable since it is a previously owned book however.
3,Boring!!,"If your teacher assigns this book, don't read it, you can get all the info at the local library for free!!!"
2,Sociology,"This book is outdated, but it will get you through your class. If it is ok with the instructer to use an older edition I would recomend it."
2,Sociology expensive and not a good source of information,"The book is very expensive for a paperback,information is mixed up and terms are not bold print or examples of the word are shown.This is not a great book where you need to find out information because its just not there.Locating words from index and finding them is a hassle because it might be on another page you have to read it word for word."
2,Falling apart!,"I just bought this stupid book a couple of weeks ago. Material wise it's fine. It covers everything in my class. My main problem is that half of the pages have fallen out of it, making it worthless to sell back. It's such a pain to have to gather the pages of my textbook and shove them back into the book. I'd return the dumb thing but my classes are accelerated so by the time I got a new one the class would be over. Don't buy it if you can avoid it!"
2,Not my cup of tea.,"It has a substantial bias, however what sociology book won't? Still worked well for the intro soc class I'm taking."
2,Slow to recieve shipment,"The book itself is in good condition, but buying it from BetterWorld Books was a bad idea. My first order I placed for this book was cancelled due to the fact that they had sold it after I had paid for it. They didn't tell me until a few days after. My money was not returned and I was forced to buy another copy which arrived nearly 2 weeks later. Very bad customer service on their part. I will never buy from this company again in the future if I can avoid it!"
2,Not woth the money.,I had this radio about six months and the SD card reader went out. Poor reception for the radio leaves me with buyers remorse. Go with a better brand. Stay away from Boss. I swapped it for a better radio.
3,Boss468Bi,The radio itself is good but the product support from boss audio is not good at all. I contacted Boss technical support with a wiring question & they replied with a standard answer. It was obvious they didn't reasearch or care about my question. I continue to have problems with the radio. I would recommend buying a similar product from another company who wants to help their customers.
3,Radio Reception,I am considering buying this radio was looking for RDS but I cannot find information and to the sensitivity of the radio. Will it pull in weak stations and is is selective is my question.
5,Gotta love the ponies.,So I bought this because I had seen season two and the no set not out yet and wanted to see it again. It great to have because it feels like a short movie and fills my pony crave. Not alot of extra.
4,my little pony,the shiping was not long at all but the only thing i had a thing was the case and the case cover they were both a little damaged but beside that i give it a 4 out of 5 for that
5,DUETS II,"My wife and mother in law had the opportunity to see Frank Sinatra a couple of times in NYC. He was great (I think my mother in law was a bobby socker). Very cool. The music selection is great and I had purchased this, and the first Duets CD for her because she really enjoys the music of Sinatra. He is the Chairman of the Board and worked hard at his craft to be the best. I highly recommend these albums to anyone who appreciates the big band sound and the melodic singing of Sinatra."
2,"Umm, vomit","The first Duets album was not so great, though a huge financial success. I do recommend it for Mr. Sinatra's closing song with Kenny G (One for My Baby.) It is really worth the cost of the whole album.But ... Duets II is not a worthy successor. There are some nice tracks, such as ""Moonlight in Vermont"" with the always amazing Linda Ronstadt. But overall you are better served going back to listen to some of the Chairman's masterpieces, such as 1955's ""Wee Small Hours of the Morning.""Duets 1 really is worth a listen. I dare anyone not to be moved by the closing song. It's all about age, experience and having been down the road of life. But Phil Ramone's work is no substitute for Nelson Riddle."
2,Sad-wish he hadn't recorded it-should be put on the shelf.,"I was hoping this would really be a listening joy, but was most dissappointed. FAS sounded sick, tired and old--not the way ""I"" want to remember him or his voice. Think it was a rip-off for the Sinatra fans, especially the ""Embracable You"" w/Lena Horne-can't even listen to it w/o cringing at the lack of air, phrasing and just plain poor vocals on both parts."
2,"If you Love Sinatra, Please Stay Away","Am sitting here listening to this CD that I just got. I am so sorry that I listened. Sinatra sounds like what he was when he recorded this, a man nearly 80 years old. I would much rather remember him as he sounded in his younger days.Listening to this is akin to watching Elizabeth Taylor not as she was in her Cleopatra glory but as she looked in her old age. I would rather remember the former than the latter."
2,"Save your cash. Better yet, buy originals","Sorry, this was a bad idea revisited. This has even fewer memorable cuts that the first Duets. Even worse, it has some which should never have been recorded.It doesn't get too much worse than Jon Secada singing ""The Best is Yet to Come"". Ditto for Patti Labelle's ""Bewitched"". Frank and N. Diamond joining on ""The House I Live In"" is almost a caracature. Jimmy Buffet needs to go back to Margaritaville, leaving the classic ""Mack The Knife"" to the Chariman of the Board.Duets was a bad idea made worse the second time around."
4,Loved the duet with Luis Miguel!!!,The CD is worth buying just for this one track.Frank Sinatra and Luis Miguel are probably the biggest balladeers of our time. It was fun to listen to Sinatra and his protege singing it out!Awesome!
2,Don't bother,Blah - I ordered 3 of these. Only 1 actually fits my infant. Poor quality control if you ask me!
2,Too small for one size fits all,I bought this hat for my barely 3 month old son. The hat itself is very nice. It is a decent thickness for cold days and the quality was really good. When it arrived it did not fit on my son's head. He does not have an abnormally large head (I would say he is average...and so does the doctor). He was never able to wear this so we have passed it on to friends that have just had a baby. It was unfortunate because we got it for our trip to Canada and had to make due with thinner hats and hoods. Just beware that they are quite small.
3,Not one big happy family,"Back Cover: ""Laura felt young and defenseless in the trubulent Trevayne household - completely overshadowed by her glamorous cousin Cleo. Cleo, widow of Troilus, the third brother, considered herself a true Trevayne and was certainly as unpredictable as the philandering Perry and the arrogant Dominic. It was unfortunate that it was Perry who treated Laura as a woman, for Laura was in love with Dominic, and he regarded her as a child.""Laura is aghast and isolated by the actions and words of the manipulative and bitter family which she is temporarily residing with while she tries to care for Cleo's unwanted son."
2,Kind of dull strings,"Having read the other reviews, I agree thesestrings are almost average. The tone is notright. Perhaps Martin thought that if theyduplictaed the 6 string version it would workon a 12 string. Well wrong! 2 x 6 might equal 12..but that's fine if you are building a house orsomething. Well no! Just trying to put new stringson a 12 string guitar..I will certainly purchase D'Addario or similar nexttime. Therefore, fellow reviewers I agree with someand disagree with others. No need for comments inthe box! Let's get practising. A Gbmaj13#11 is agreat way to begin a song. [Easy Lover by PhilCollins et al]."
5,the best of the best,Martin being the best Acoutic strings makes the sound of my new guitar even better. Great quality and the price was right!
2,Not impressed,"I bought these strings thinking that they would be nice since they're from Martin. But when I got them and put them on my guitar I found that they are the complete opposite of what I expected. They sound like strings that you get on a cheaper guitar and my fingers stick to them when sliding, they even feel cheap. I would not recommend these strings to my friends and I am highly disappointing in this product. After I put them on my guitar I ended up buying a completely different set of strings on here from another company."
5,My daughter's absolute favorite friend,"My daughter is a self proclaimed ""Cat Lover."" Bootsie (or Lollipop as she is known by at our house) is my daughter's number one kitty. Lolli has seen better days - she has lost a lot of the dark markings, which now look a very very light gray. But she is durable, easy to clean, and well loved. She gets carried everywhere. I'm so glad to know there are more Lollipops out there if we ever lose our Lolli."
5,She-ra - Princess of Power,"It was an excellent buy, and I was surprised (in a good way)that the dvd contained the first episode which explained, how She-ra got her powers. A very recommenable dvd."
4,I have the power...,"This is great...although it's not the full season(s), this is a great overview of some of the most creative episodes as well as the backstory to the She-Ra/He-man saga. The only thing I would have wished for from this DVD is a compilation that encompassed all of the characters and their powers. The extra DVD commentary and interviews was pretty cool too."
3,20 Something Nostalgie,"I watched this show as a kid...decided to buy the movies...I remeber them being more fun and interesting, but still not bad. It is good for the late 20, early 30 somethings to have a walk down memory lane. These videos may not be worth the money; depends how much you really liked She-Ra."
5,Just as I remembered,It was so awesome to be able to share these dvds with my kids and show them how the 80s rocked!
5,Beautiful,"Many have stated that Jealous is the best song on Faith and Courage, or the worse. I think it is one of the best. But you've probably heard the song so I won't comment on it. Instead I will write about the other two songs on this single.Summer's End is a very nice song, something you can sing along to. It's a fun song, not serious in any way. But still, like most of Sinéad's material, this is a love song.The other song, Full Circle, is the most beautiful song Sinéad has ever covered. Sinéad's voice is full and full of emotion. I'm shocked it didn't make it onto Faith and Courage. The song is almost a prayer to the dead. Just hearing her sing ""Did you find peace there?"" is enough to make anyone cry."
1,Sad Sadder Saddest,"It just keeps getting worse, doesn't it. With one of the weakest releases of the year behind her ('Faith and Courage'), Sinead O'Connor had the nerve to go on releasing subsequent singles from that inexplicably tame CD.While 'No mans woman' was bearable, and confirmed that Sinead was indeed a woman who loved women, the new song 'Jealous' is startlingly mediocre, starting with the lyrics, the rendering, the instrumentation, and ultimately, an extremely ugly CD single cover.A thorough disappointment, this coming from a long-time Sinead fan. Perhaps she should just give up."
2,Disappointing,"I'm an avid fan of Carlos Heitor Cony. I bought this book even without reading the sinopsis but it turned out to be everything else but a Cony's book. It feels as if it were written in a hurry, without Cony's character and feelings. This was one of the very few times I haven't finished a book."
4,Typical Barney,"This is one of my son's favorite Barney CDs. He can listen to it over and over and never get bored. He even sings along with the songs and enjoys all of them. I would definetly recommend this CD is your child likes Barney. A lot of the songs teach kids great lessons like everyone is special, we all grow, friends and manners are good, buckle your seat belt etc. The downside of the CD is, like most Barney CDs, the music can get really annoying after a while for the parent. But if your kids like Barney then they will enjoy this CD."
5,Very nice CD,"My baby girl loves Barney and I bought this CD for her and she loves it. She likes to dance and sing with the songs. the songs are very fun and enjoyable. I dance with my baby with the songs. I recommend this CD for all kids , especially if they like Barney!"
3,meh....,"Nothing extraordinary about the design (very cliche) nor the print quality . Actually doesn't look that nice once you unfold it to 16"" x 20"". May look nicer if smaller and placed together in a set of four."
3,"NOT 20x16!! Nice deal, but wrong size advertised!","The true size of this poster is like 13x19 NOT the 16x20 listed! So, it is misleading and a little hard to find that size frame. The prints are cheap and nice, but don't go buying the frames until you see the actual size!"
2,Smells great but....,"the coffee isn't great. Coffee flavor is weak and acidic. The chocolate and orange flavor is not as good as expected. Maybe I am an expresso drinker but definitely a really weak coffee. Other than that, can't complain about the service."
2,All Play golf net,I bought one of these and 3 days later a light wind (under 15 MPH) blew it over and one of the fiberglass support poles snapped. The net was set up and staked down as per instructions. The retail clerk informed me that the net was not designed to withstand that kind of wind. I obtained a refund and I am now loooking for a quality net.
2,Misleading product,"Good part .. it is what they say it is. Sad part .. You discover what they don't tell you. Here is what I discovered.This is meant to used Indoors. It is not meant for outdoors. If you do put it Outdoors, reinforce it so that it can handle gentle breeze. I was planning on using it Outdoors. If I were planning on using it indoors, I would give it 5 stars."
4,Really good lentils,"Lentils are one of the oldest cultivated products. There are about 35 varieties of lentils available commercially. I really like this variety.I thought that they would cook-up to be blacker rather than brown but I was mistaken. I used a really simple recipe to compare them to other lentils:6 cups low sodium chicken broth1 cup lentils1 bay leaf1 finely diced onionCook it until the lentils start to break and you're good to go. Compared to other lentils, I found these to taste (but not look) better."
5,Love these Lentils,"I have to say that my family totally enjoys these lentils to the point of other family members bring their empty tins over to ""share"" in my bounty of lentils. They cook up fast and have a wonderful taste cooking in just chicken stock. I will go to the ends of the earth to find these as the flavor is so tasty and does not need a lot of additives for a wonderful flavor."
4,Love this movie...,...but was a little disappointed it didn't have all the songs from the movie on this soundtrack but I knew that when I got it. I still like it but am now going to have to hunt down the other songs.
5,Great!,"If you love the oldies, you'll love this! Big band? Yep! It's all here. I love everyone of these songs! It's one of the most listened to CD's in our house. I'm too young to actually remember Dean Martin and those singers. However, this CD feels like a slightly modernized version of what I would imagine those days to be like."
3,"Ah, the movie is perfect, the soundtrack isn't","I was disappointed by the soundtrack. where is the Frank Sinatra song that was one of the most wonderful moments in this wonderful movie? and the heart breaking song (no pan intended) that was the background of the heart transplant operation? the songs in the CD are nice and sweet, but the two most important pieces are not there and that's a huge disappointment. a movie that good deserved an equal soundtrack. WHERE IS FRANKIE?"
2,Disappointing,"I LOVE LOVE LOVED the movie, and eagerly purchased this soundtrack thinking the best of the best would be included. NOT SO! The CD contains LESS THAN 40 minutes of tunes, most are somber and unmemorable, and with the exception of the title track including both Dean Martin and Joey Gain's wonderful versions, this is lacking all the guts of the movie...like when they dance in the garden and Blue Eyes sings his heart out. Or when Gracie gets her heart transplant and the sweet vocals of JEWEL play in the background. There was so much emotion in this movie and in the music accompanying it; too bad for the most part this CD just missed the impact."
5,"Stop kvetching, already","Enough with the Frank Sinatra and the Jewel songs. What everyone appears to be overlooking is the great song by Joey Gian, ""What if I Loved You"" played over the credits and, of course, the incomparable ""I Second that Emotion."" If you get the DVD version, there's a video version of ""What if I Loved You."" If you're like me, you'll play it over and over."
3,Good...If You Liked the Movie,"""Return to Me"" - the movie, is, in my opinion, superb. The sound track...perhaps not. I grew up listening to many of the same tunes Bonnie Hunt (director and script co-author) did. She picked several sung by Dean Martin. Other tunes performed by the Jackie Gleason Orchestra (featuring Bobby Hackett on trumpet, I believe) are some of the most ""classic"" romantic music ever recorded. The highlight is the third cut - ""What If I Loved You"" by Joey Gian. It's become sort of modern swing classic. I enjoy the sound track, but then, I thoroughly enjoy the movie."
3,"it's missing a few songs, but it's still a good album...","I was excited to receive this CD, and when I did, my excitement dwindled somewhat...First--only 37 minutes of music??? I feel ripped off.Second--where's ""the real mccoy"" song we hear in the film???I'm most happy about the Dean Martin ""Return to Me"" remake. Apparently the producers utilized the vocal track from Dino's original recording and then remixed it with new music to give it a modern flare.I recommend the CD, but with some reservation."
3,RETURN TO ME Soundtrack,"I agree 100% with the comments that the other reviewers have left regarding this movie's soundtrack album!I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it (about one year ago)! Since then, I had to buy the dvd and am very suprized that I have not worn it out!I loved every song used in the movie, however, the ones I truly wanted were not on the soundtrack. I really wanted to have ""The Real McCoy"" by Frank Sinatra, ""Buona Sera"" by Minnie Driver (scene where David Duchovny leaves the restaurant and looks back to see her singing through the window), and other songs not included.Nevertheless, the movie will remain one of my favories, right next to STEEL MAGNOLIAS!"
3,The Jewel song you're asking about...,"...is called ""Angel Standing by"" and it's from her album ""Pieces of You."""
4,songs left out of soundtrack,"Is it my imagination, or was there a song on this soundtrack by jewel? If so, does anyone know what it is called? I absolutely loved it & it made the movie! This movie was great!"
1,Terrible,"I teach a guitar class and inherited four of these guitars. All four of them have the neck separating at the heel and the bridges pulling away from the body of the guitar. Badly. The guitars are two years old. All of the pick guards are peeling up as well.Do NOT. Don't even think about it. There are better quality guitars here.BTW, don't think about Washburn's brand credibility - these are not built by Washburn but built by a Chinese company for Washburn to fill the beginner market.Do NOT."
4,I have an alternate plan!,"This is a great movie for Get Smart addicts. It isn't as good as the TV show, but it still makes me happy!"
2,Worse than a bad episode,"This movie was very disappointing. Maybe it was the positive reviews here that got my hopes up. The movie used a lot of the jokes from the TV show and that's a plus. Unfortunately, they weren't delivered very well. Some of you are going to flame me for saying this, but I liked the Andy Dick version more than this (in spite of his on screen presence)."
3,Lets Hope The Rumored Remake of The Show Means That Complete DVD Seasons Will Soon Be a Reality!,Get Smart is a hilarious classic sitcom and I was disappointed when they stopped showing the reruns on Nick at Nite and TV Land and while this movie is okay it just isn't up to snuff with the sitcom and I find it's a shame that that classic sitcom isn't on DVD but I just found out that they are in the process of trying to film a movie remake of the sitcom and since the first season of Bewitched cmae out right around the same time as the theatrical remake and the first season of I Dream of Jeanie is coming out and there is rumors of a theatrical remake well lets hope that if it is true about A Get Smart remake that that will mean that complete seasosn for the sitcom will finally be coming!
4,Release the original Get Smart tv series on DVD,"The Get Smart Again movie is good, but the original TV series are much better. In my opinion, Get Smart is among the best and the funniest tv series ever released. I am looking forward to see them on DVD. I hope, soon!"
4,Release the original Series Please!!!!,This is a good movie but I have to echo others that have posted here. The series was perhaps the funniest series ever on tv.
2,Not a patch on the TV Series.,"I'm sorry to say that this film just doesn't work. It all comes across as tired, forced, and worrying that someone will fracture their ageing hips in a tumble during the chase scenes.Like many, I still await the release of the original TV series - a TRUE classic in comedy. Save your money for then.."
3,Good but release the TV series on Dvd,A good Tv film made years before the end of the Tv series.With some of the actors reprising their roles which made them famous.Please release the original Tv-series on Dvd!.
5,Collection of a master,"Really just one word, superb. Matheson is a master of the genre. Each story crafted & beautifully written. Read all his stuff, including the great 'Hell House' & 'I Am Legend', you won't regret it."
4,richard matters,"a great collection. matheson has a way of writing. he shows you how you can express more and be more intense with a simplistic style. it makes it easier to read and more understandable too. what he is real master at is describing how little things just grow to be bigger. like in mad house and legion of plotters. i couldn't really appreciate it. it was so well written that i felt just as irritated as the fictive person. strange this, i almost never feel with the characters in a story. a great haunted house story, a great.... Well, just buy it."
1,Missing Duel,"The whole reason I bought this book was because it was supposed to include Duel. I had just seen the movie, loved it, and desperately wanted to read the short story upon which it was based.But despite advertising to the contrary, Duel is nowhere to be found in this collection!Talk about a bait and switch. How could the publisher have made such a whopper of a mistake? It really doesn't matter how good the other stories are. The omission of Duel is such a massive blunder I have no choice but to give this one star."
1,Book,I am not paricularly enjoying these sort stories. I isn't qite wat was hoping for. Most horror stories are much more entertaining.
4,Cozy mornings,"I got this robe for my 8 year old daughter's birthday. She really likes it, it's her first bathrobe. I bought white, so we can ""match."" It's not really thick & plush, it's more light weight. Only complaint she has is that it doesn't stay closed up around her chest area. There's no inner tie on the opposite side to help keep it across her chest. That would be an easy fix tho, if it really bugs her I could add that. Otherwise very happy with it."
4,Warm and comfortable,"I got this robe for myself. It was exactly what I wanted, which is a warm winter robe with a zipper that's comfortable. A winner!"
3,terry robe,terry robe what I expected and fits well. On the other hand the belt wraps around the child 4 times. I would say belt belongs to a larger size. Not worth bother of exchanging.
1,"Misleading item, not much selection","The entry for this item shows 10 colors and sizes from 4-14. Oh sorry, we only have two colors in sizes 8-12. Tacky."
1,disappointing quality,"I am really disappointed with the quality of this robe. It is labeled as 100% polyester, and the seller claims it is mislabeled and the product is 80% cotton. It definitely does not feel like cotton at all. Not the nice snuggly cotton robe I was hoping for. Will be returning."
1,"Overstated, amateurish, crude, juvenile parody.",The antithesis of clever. Like watching a bad high school drama club production. Dimwits offering their hacked-up American version of Monty Python. (My apologies to Monty Python for associating them with this retarded bunch.)
4,Comedy With Soul,"The WKUK are the greatest comedy troupe I have ever seen. Their sketches and songs are hilarious, but they offer more than that. They love what they do, and you can see the joy and enthuisiasm coming out of them as they perform. Its tangible, you can feel it. You can watch some of their stuff on YouTube to preview, and all of it is hilarious with sketches like ""Space Potatoes"", ""Motorcycle Mama"" and ""Supersize me, with whiskey!"" I know this DVD is a hit, and it will definetly teach you one thing... PIZZA BAGELS AREN""T FOR BREAKFAST!!!!"
1,"Dire, unfunny sketch show","Good lord, is this show bad! I only made it through a handful of episodes before turning it off in disgust. And I thought ""The State"" was the worst sketch show I ever saw (I guess I can thank my lucky stars no one ever gave ""The Bert Fershners"" their own program). Good sketch comedy: ""Mr. Show,"" ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" ""French & Saunders,"" ""Kids In the Hall,"" ""SCTV Network."" This stuff should never be put on the air. But, they're young guys. Maybe if someone puts them all back in the comedy school, they'll grow and become funny. Maybe they should go on tour with Dane Cook. I'm sure their audiences would get along famously."
5,Funniest show you probably haven't seen.,"The whitest kids you know is a mash up of ""Kids in the Hall"" and ""Monty Python"". Dress wearing (not many ladies in this show) and crude, their sketches are sometimes brilliant and often offensive, this is the only sketch comedy show on today worth watching. I can NOT recommend this enough."
2,What's all the fuss?,"What is all the fuss about this book? I found the geographical setting an interesting idea and was totally up for being enthralled. Hoeg does write beautifully about snow and ice-clad settings, but a good novelist he is not, in my opinion. I found the pace of the plot turgid and dull, dull, dull. I was not particularly interested in any of the characters and didn't much care what happened to any of them. Although some of his descriptive narrative is extremely beautiful and different, much of it went on for far too long, and as a result, I forgot what I was supposed to be reading about. I'm a bit annoyed that a novel which seemed to captivate many of my friends, quite frankly left me cold."
5,Mr Hoag's Feeling for a darn good story!,"I was drawn to this book after enjoying the Hollywood movie. It seemed like an interesting x-files variant and I was into anything conspiratorial at the time so I gave it a shot. And boy did I get a pleasant suprise, this is far more than a suspense/mystery. It delves into the mysteries of all that make us human, with characters that are each one of them flawed, damaged, beautiful and REAL. The atmosphere Hoag creates has the clarity of a dream, and perhaps in the translation to English this book has gained something rather than lost, for the unusual style of word placement adds a definate otherworldy feel. When I was reading the book I recall thinking that there was no way any conclusion could match the caliber of the story. How could anyone read a tale of such darkness, such reality as this and come away satisfied? Well, like me you'll just have to find out for yourself. Please pick up this book if you have a chance. You won't regret it."
2,iRock doesn't Rock at all,I agree with most of the negative feeds on this keyboard-poor visibility/poor illumination/loud hum when EL is on. This review is about their customer service. That doesn't rock either.I got this because i had dim vision and in a normally lit room i couldn't see the letters on a KB. My illumination didn't work most of the time. If i left the switch on it would just start working and then as suddenly stop working. I started the customer rma process in january of 07 and have pursued it all the way through my Attorney General's consumer complaint division. I sent the defective unit back and there has NEVER been a case where they contacted me. I always had to call them. I wouldn't buy anything this company makes because of this lousy response to my legitiimate complaints.
2,Avoid this one. Beauty is only skin deep.,"1. The keys are lifeless. Flat and planar, it's easy to hit the wrong key.2. The El is noisy. Mine hums audibly. As mentioned by another reviewer, the board lights up and the letters are solid, which makes them hard to see.3. After only a month of regular daily use, my left shift key has occassionally stopped functioning, as has the enter key on the num pad.it's pretty (oh, there goes my shift key again.0), but is inherently a bad design that is poorly executed. i bet no one at Irocks uses these keyboards. i'm sorely dissapointed."
3,too small not well illuminated,"This keyboard isn't terrible, it fits nicely with the Apple design asthetic. However it is quite small. Especially it does not have navigation arrows and navigation keys broken out into their own section to the right of the main keyboard as most modern keyboards do. This is fine if you are tight on space, but not if you are purchasing this keyboard solely for the illumniation.Second, the illumination is ok, but not that great, especially if you have reflected light from another source (like a monitor) shining on the keyboard."
2,Company wont stand by listing,"Listing said 12 pair and i got 1 pair and they would not make it right , they just removed the listing ."
3,"This is NOT the best edition of the Sonnets, but...","Like the last viewer, I appreciated Rowse's translation of Shakespeare's original syntax into colloquial, 20th century verse. However, I thought Rowse's interpretation of the sonnets (which he provides along side each sonnet) to be casual, imprecise--and even just plain crazy.I think this book does the job. It provides you with a complete collection of Shakespeare's sonnets, in an excellent, hardback format, but the secondary scholarship just isn't that good."
2,"Echo, but battery and distance okay...now the phone is dead","This was an okay phone, kind of annoying, but okay. The echo was very annoying for me, but the wife says it is okay and she doesn't mind. Really the only reason we kept this phone was because of the talking caller ID for the kids. The 2.4 mhz interferes with my local wireless network which is also annoying. So anyway, the power has gone off, and the blasted phone flashed all the lights and says E3...which isn't documented in the manual, nor is any information about what an E3 is, is available from somewhere else like panasonic.com."
1,Piece of junk,"What I would give for a cordless phone w/ answering machine that functions as a basic phone! This phone has an echo when even 2 feet from the base. It completely cuts out down the hall (15 feet away). People keep asking if I'm on a cell phone. I really wanted to love this phone, but the basics just aren't there. Also, the digital answering machine quality is pathetic on the normal level an barely passable in the enhanced mode. Finally, why why why would Panasonic get rid of the one button quick dial feature they had for years. It now takes 5 button presses just to dial common numbers.Note I also tried the Uniden DCT 5285 and that also has a pronounced echo which makes it sound like you're on a cell phone. I've returned both of these phones and will keep looking."
1,E3 - Blinking Lights After Power Outage,I had this phone for 8 months and was very happy with it untill I came home from work today to find it dead. The phone displaed the E3 message and all the lights were blinking. My wife told me the power flicked briefly and she wondered if that may have been the cause. I would have never belived it to be the case if I hadn't read the previous couple of reviews on this phone. DON'T buy this phone it's not worth it!
1,"""Mr. Watson--I'M DYING!!""","Poor Alexander Graham Bell would have been dissolved into skeletonhood if he had had to get Watson's attention that fateful day in 1876 using a farging Panasonic KX-TG2248S. This piece of junk goes into cardiac crapshock on lesser voltage surges than you can generate by petting a longhaired cat or shuffling across a carpet in wool socks. They should have designated this telephonic turdbox the ""E3"" because that seems to be the only number it can remember.I would recoomend this unit as a gift to annoying relatives, ex-spouses, or anyone else so long as you have no desire to speak to them. At the moment, this thing has been replaced by a 1934 Automatic Electric model 40, which at least remains functional when there is a forecast of an electrical storm within 100 miles. That's a lot more than I can say for the Panasonic, and the rest of what I'd say is unprintable.I give this thing one star for having been packed in box sturdy enough to hold a couple of crushed beer cans."
1,E3,"Unplugged the phone and moved it to another location, after 3 or 4 years of use. Got the E3 error. Panasonic confirmed that it's a problem with the phone that can't be corrected by the user. They stood by their 1 year warrantee, despite the fact that it's a built in design defect. Wanted to charge me $80 + tax and $10 shipping for a replacement or $95 for a repair.3 or 4 years isn't really that bad a lifespan, but I suspect that I would have had this problem a lot sooner if I moved the phone earlier. In any event I'm buying another phone. In my experience cordless phone quality is terrible in general."
1,Another victim of E3,My only complain about this phone before today was that our old microwave seemed to interfere with the phone's frequency. However today I've found the phone completely dead with lights flashing and famous E3 error showing.I guess I should also blame this on a power problem since we've had bad weather. But this is not an excuse. After reading all the reviews I doubt I'll get another Panasonic phone to replace this one.
3,Panasonic replacing phones with E3-Error,My Panasonic KX-TG2258S died with the famous E3 error.I called the customer service and they told me it's due to an internal chip burn out. They'd replace my phone even after the warranty has expired.
2,A Possible e3 Fix For Panasonic KX-TG2258S ...,"After a brief power outage from a thunder storm, I also experienced an e3/lights blinking error. I unplugged the phone and plugged it back in several times to no avail. After doing this a couple of times unsuccessfully, I hit the ""STOP"" button on the base immediately after plugging it in (before it completed booting up to show the ""e3 message"")and it reset itself and now works fine (or as well as it did prior to the e3). Try it before tossing yours in the garbage"
2,E3 Error and a diabled phone,"When I first got this unit two months ago I was impressed with the variety of useful features such as voice actuated caller ID and handset programming. However the unit has permanently crashed after a brief power outage, and now the unit lights flicker constantly while flashing an ""E3"" error message. This problem was noted by another reviewer and is unacceptable in a new unit. Previously I had good luck with Panasonic answering machines but this is discouraging."
1,E3 error victim,Do not buy this Phone. Panasonic has poor customer service and they do not have any troubleshooting information on their website.I called support and they said they need to send the phone to their repair center and costs $90 plus ..which sucks...
2,ANOTHER E3 ERROR VICTIM,"Phone was working great for over a year - a VERY brief power outage later, phone dead with E3 error and a bunch of blinking lights....Phone was plugged in power surge protector and wll other electronics still work fine....checked the reviews here and surprised to find out I am just one of the many victims of this E3 error!!!"
1,died after 2 years with E3 error message,"I bought it 2 years ago for $100 from Costco and it died yesterday with the famous E3 error message, I call Panasonic, the only suggestion they give is to send it to a repair center which they said it will cost $80, what a joke."
1,E3 Error,"This phone was great up until it died. I really enjoyed the talking caller ID feature and the generally high quality of the system.I found this page while hunting for a solution to the apparently-infamous ""E3"" error -- the LCD displays ""E3"" while flashing the clock icon, and all of the LEDs repeatedly flash. I have no idea why this occurred. The unit was working perfectly, I unplugged it to move it to a new location in the house, and when I plugged it back in it was dead.What an expensive piece of junk."
1,Piece of trash,"(Shaking head in disbelief) My phone died within a couple of months after spending well over $100 for it. I had the thing boxed up for quite some time, hoping to somehow, someway be able to get the thing serviced.Same deal- E3 error after disconnecting the power connection. If you are ignorant enough to be considering buying one of these phones after reading these reviews (if they're still selling these pieces of trash) I would suggest you buying a battery backup power supply and hardwire it into the output AC contacts. A word of caution- be sure to turn off power to the UPS first. Too bad this information is only viewed by a few- Panasonic sure deserves the black eye."
1,Another E3 error even though phone is relatively new :-(,"When I first got the all the red flashing lights and ""E3"" error, I thought it must be some sort of power surge. So I changed outlets and changed sets. To no avail. Then I inadventenly plugged in the ac adapter sideways and voila, problem fixed. However, few months later, problem returned. This is such a new phone, I hate to throw it out. So I'm going to invest in a new ac adaptor 'cause I suspect it has something to do with the contacts. I'll do that & let you guys know the outcome. I've had a panasonic in the past that lasted a long time: 6+ yrs. However, I believe that this is such a new technology with a residential phone that they haven't worked out all the glitches yet. However, as the other reviewers can attest, unless you like throwing money away this is a bad product."
1,Yet another dead E3 phone,"I'm so disappointed, what a waste of money. I bought this phone about 8 months ago and it is now dead with all the lights flashing and displaying an E3. Do not buy this phone people, I personally am staying away from any Panasonic product from now on."
1,E 3 error code and a dead phone,The phone displays E 3 error code and all panel lights are blinking. The phone's base unit is permanently dead only after a brief power outage. The phone power was protected by a large power surge protector. The phone is less than 1 year old.
2,Not impressed,Did not receive clear connection. If you are on the phone and microwaving the phone has a lot of static. Talking caller ID does not pull up names out of phonebook and states unknown name even if it has already been entered in phone book.
1,HORRIBLE,The battery life on this phone is horrible. I've been through 2 batteries already. Worst phone I ever bought. Going to by a Uniden
1,another E3 victim,Thank you to everyone who helped seal the fact that this phone is dead after the E3 error. Funny thing is that I've had the error a few times in the past 6 mos and I've gotten it to reset every time. This time was the end though... a power outage and now its dead. :-(
3,Eye Opener,"Enjoyed the tale, read it in about three hours, appreciated the style and the way it all hung together, found many aspects very amusing, especially the climax of five nuns and Ms Hudson chained together in the back of a van.. also very educational for me into the life styles of people I do not come across.. do not understand how the residents of The Chelsea can pay for their accommodations, or how the hotel permits unregistered guests to shack up in various rooms! But also an insight into the American female mind, no wonder families rarely stay together in that country, it is all about getting quick excitement and immediate satisfaction for oneself! What about doing something with ones life that is worthwhile? None of the characters in the book had a structure apart from the fellow in retirement from Liverpool... not far from where I was born... OK! These comments are too serious! I will certainly read more of her work. (I came across this in a hotel library whilst on holiday in Menorca)."
1,"Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","Boring, badly written, no plot, silly beyond words. Contrived. SIMPLY AWFUL!To be avoided at all costs."
3,"Where's the sparkle, Sparkle?","Sparkle Hayter has done a great job with this series of comic mysteries featuring Robin Hudson, girl TV journalist. However, this new title is long on fun froth and pretty short on interesting characters and story. Who really cares about Nadia and Rocky, two lame young characters who spin the plot? But Maggie Mason is a find, and the nunsense at the end is laugh-out-loud funny. Okay for the beach but not much else--the earlier efforts are much better. Will still look forward to the next book, tho!"
2,did I read the same book?,"I can't believe how many of the previous reviewers used words like ""wacky"" and ""zany"" to describe this book. I felt that the fun of the previous novels was in short supply. Previous books started with an off-beat premise and went from there; this one adds on handcuffed nuns as an afterthought to a boring ""mystery."""
2,Weakest of the series,"I'm a guy, so perhaps I'm not the target audience for this series, but I really enjoyed ""What's A Girl Gotta Do"". I liked the irrelevant character of Robin Hudson -- who can't love a character that uses poision ivy for personal protection! (Reminds me of something from P.G. Wodehouse -- another favorite author.)Since then I've checked my bookstore every few months for the latest in the series. I recently read ""The Chelsea Girl Murders"" and I think the series has lost some of its fun. Perhaps because Robin has ""grown up"", gaining responsibilities. Perhaps it's because many of the characters from earlier books aren't here but in passing. Or, perhaps because she's no longer using poision ivy. It's still worth a read, but it's not as good as the earlier stories."
3,Not as good as the others,"I really enjoyed Sparkle Hayter's other book, Naked Brunch and picked up all of her books. This one to me was not as tight as the earlier books in the series IMO. I still liked it, enjoyed taking another journey with Robin, but it didn't do as much for me. I definitely like the Nice Girls Finish Last a bit more."
5,"Super, Sweet, Cool. Ska-Rock-Funk, it's the best blend!","I'll keep it short. It rocks. The perfect fusion of Ska, Rock and Funk.Great work. Their other CD is not on here, ""Mmm, Mmm, Mmm"". Which is too bad because it's equally as good."
1,peice of crap,"this thing doesn't work, nothing but black and white image and off center. my video card is ntsc like it said but won't work on the 3 computers i have. don't buy this, buy a video converter box."
1,doesnt work,Well the item didn't work how it said it would. The picture was black and scrambled at best.
2,does it work??,"these cable will work only on desktops computers, i bough this to use on a mobile system to be able to take some screen shots and videos, this cable didn't work in the neither of the 30 mobile system i try, from Alienware, HP, Dell, Compaq, Lenovo etc...."
1,DON'T BUY,Don't buy this at all! I bought this to use on my media center. All that happens when I plug it in is black and white lines across the screen. I've tried restarting and everything. I'll try for a refund.
1,"Do not purchase, FALSE advertising!!!","Vendor claims Amazon puts up the title and they match the product, so if Amazon sells ""Brakes"", only after the item arrives at your doorstep, will you read from the invoice that it was brakes for a Mercedes and not your BMW!!!The item is shipped as a HD15M, RCA-F/DIN4-F MATROX G450/ on the invoice ...If you don't have a Matrox G450, you are on the hook for your shipping charges back to them."
1,"Product doesn't work, wish it did.","Thought it sounded too easy. Needed something to work with my laptop. Wish I would have read the customer reviews first like I generally do. At least it was only about 10 bucks w/shipping. Didn't get any funcionality with the rca connection, the s-video showed a scrambled screen in gray scale. Oh well, live and learn."
1,Terrible...,Either the item is faulty or my television is too old but it didnt work for me. I needed to use the component from vga to avoid taking up my s video and dvi openings on ym video card and the television never picked up the signal. Instead if you have a component open for video just use the s video converter not from this item.
4,It works,"It works for what I need,haven't had any issues, but if your looking for a ""Hi-Def"" picture you need a much better quality adapter.Remember you generally get what you pay for."
1,Don't be fooled by this adapter!,"Apparently this adapter works with only a few video cards. The computer I bought this for did not work. THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH MOST COMPUTERS! If you decide to send it back, send it back with a return receipt from the post office (certified mail - it costs extra). I sent mine back to the seller without the certified mail and they claimed they never received it and I did not have the proof in a certified receipt."
1,It didn't work,"The item was inexpensive, and shipped fast, but the shipping was $11 some odd. I would assume shipping is not refundable.The VGA out works on the computer to an external monitor, and the RCA inputs on the TV work from our old XBox, but this adapter did not work. The TV did not detect any sort of a signal input.We tried both the RCA and S-Video connections, but neither one worked."
1,not working,"hibroght for connection from laptop to TV, did not work, i did not return due to cost, still in electric box at my home, do not spend mondey...."
1,Does Not Work,"Tried this out with two computers, two TVs...didn't work. It acted like it was outputting a signal with one scenario, but it was just a black screen.I tried the composite video AND the s-video to no avail.Purchase something else."
1,the worst item ever to be sold anywhere,i gave it one star only because it won't let me give the option of no stars
1,Terrible,"Wish I would have read the reviews before wasting money on it. Tried on multiple PCs using different video cards, different OS. Never got even a slight picture."
1,Video Card To S Video And Tv Adapter Cable,"Really realyl bad, it didn't work on multiple pcs and nbsnot recommended u gonna feel sorry 4 thr moneythe only good thingthat happenned thet it was shipped the next day from my order and that ofcourse doesn't count since its doesn't work"
1,Misrepresentation,"This book is not about EMDR. Apparently the author has invented his own form of therapy and is using EMDR in the title to sell the book. Not only that, he is inaccurate in his descriptions of EMDR when he mentions it.His suggested procedures are not tested, and his credentials appear to be having given a couple of workshops. Readers should proceed with caution."
1,Dubious credentials,"I can find no verification of the author's credentials, and no information on his professional or academic achievements. Very dubious work!"
1,Robert Larson Bit Brace,1. It arrived with a badly rusted inner chuck.2. The square tang socket is four very small grooves in a circular hole and do not hold the square tang well.3. The rachet gears are exposed where they can collect debris and there is no way to lubricate the hidden rachet shaft.
2,Poorly made,"I just received this bracelet which I ordered as a Christmas present. While the bracelet itself is very pretty, I am unfortunately disappointed overall. There isn't a clasp to lock the bracelet once it is opened(granted I should have read the description more carefully). The side of the bracelet opens, allowing one to easily slip it on. However, when you close the bracelet it doesn't remain closed (maintaining the closed image of the barcelet on the site). I will be returning this and now must find another gift!!"
2,Too bad it's too small for our dog.,Ignore the size chart and go with extra large if you have anything bigger than a beagle. We ordered a second costume since the Large did not fit. It took a week for them to get back to us and tell us that it was damaged in the post. They were quick about giving us a refund though.
3,way too small,The costume is supper cute but the sizes actually run small. You'd also need to get the perfect fit in order for this costume to work right. I have a 50lb puppy and a 50lb boarder collie.. and both could not fit the costume as it is way too small. I squeezed the puppy into it but could not close the costume.. the legs were very tight on him and the hood was too short it didnt come close to reaching over his head. However the hood is very large and round which fits a person's head better then a dogs. My 3year old niece was with me while i was fitting the puppy and once I took it off him she decided to put it on... and the cosume does fits a 3year old perfectly! haha
4,Good book,"This is a good ""What If"" book. What have like it to follow some of the line troops but it was a good book."
4,Not just for Man O'War fans,"This book is a reprint of a 1950 title that I had never run across before, and it's quite fascinating. Though a paperback, it includes some great photos I hadn't ever seen. It also includes more information than I had previously seen on some of Man O'War's competitors, and a wonderful sire-by-sire section at the end which traces Man O'War's lineage back to the Godolphin Arabian. It has more detail than I could've imagined existed on some of these horses. Highly recommended!"
4,Interesting!,"Having read a book by Edward Said, I wanted to read a book written by an Israeli about the Palestinian problem. Surprisingly, the views weren't that much different. I would appreciate comments from others clarifying whether the views of this author are representative of most moderate Israelis."
5,Best English Language Book on kendo.,"At thist time, along this is probably the best english language book on kendo in existence. I have suggested that all of my students buy this book and study it carefully as an adjunct to practice.In addition to describing the physical techniques of kendo. There is a really nice section on kendo attitude and attitude of practice in the dojo. A careful study of this will help build the foundations of reiho and saho."
4,Good start...,"I ordered this book about 7 weeks ago once I started my Kendo training. I have to say that it is helpful, but certainly a little confusing for beginners. Beginners may receive more help from Kendo ""how to videos"". However, this is a good resource for those moving into the intermediate classes."
5,"Basic, Clear and Useful","Excellent source of information, a very good source to correct the technical details and vital support for those who practice Kendo"
5,Definitive guide to Kendo,"This book really is the definitive guide to Kendo. It has all the basic techniques and more technical stuff. Also contains all 10 Kata and dojo etiquette, all rules and details for competition Shiai. A perfect book for Kendo beginners and an interseting read for higher grades."
4,Kendo!!!!,"Great book. Hard to do on your own. You relly need a class and a great teacher it is all just self-taught, poor technique that will get you disqualified."
4,Almost Definitive,"It's an excelent book. It's a little like a ""This is kendo"" of the 90's. The general layout is very sober, as it should be. I just wish it had more pictures. It's OK, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it definitive."
5,One great book on kendo !,this is a wonderful and well put together book and i recommend it to any practicing kendo.
5,Greatest voice in Country Music,This CD is loaded with the best selection of songs of any Greatest Hits CD I've heard. Suzy is a great talent. Anyone who loves the sound of the female voice would enjoy listening to this CD.
3,Bleh,"The sapphire I received wasn't as blue as the one in the photo. The diamonds surrounding it were a lot smaller and the sapphire looks scratched. This makes me wonder if the sapphire is really genuine. Also, the box it came in was crushed. I need a new one to put it in before I give it away as a Christmas gift. To be fair, the pendant is still pretty just not as beautiful as it is in the picture.On the bright side, the shipping was fast. I am unsure if I'd ever order from them again. A solid ""maybe..."""
5,Building my 4th Network in Somalia - This is my reference.,"I have used the first, second, and third editions. Boucher covers everything and cuts through the industry hype. This book covers everything. I have many other books, but they focus on only one technology and often one features that don't work yet.Boucher covers everything and is especially good on overall design issues and the related matters such as grounding, shelters, antenna cabling, and power supply that make the difference between a profitable operation and a disaster."
1,W I D E Screen or FULL Screen?!?!?!?,"I just picked up my official copy of That's the Way of the World, and although the case and slip cover say it's 1:85.1 Anamorphic Widescreen, it's actually FULL SCREEN!!! I threw it in 2 different DVD players and it's definetly a FULL SCREEN DVD!Is mine a dud?Any comments? What's your copy? W I D E or FULL?"
1,Not a great flick,The movie sucks to be honest. Harvey Keitel kept it going but even he stunk. Best thing about this picture was the introduction of EW&F. The plot and the characters just didn't seem to flow with the story line...had a hard time keeping up with what was going on. The only reason I purchased this DVD was to watch EW&F. They should stick with singing.
1,"Achingly bad &#65533; cliched, offensive, trite and dull","Starts off bad and goes down hill from there. How could a film this blood soaked still be dull? Just watch it and see. Or better yet, don't. Even the charismatic Benicio can't save it. Convoluted plot twists abound but it all amounts to nothing more than a very poor crime noir in the wake of Tarantino. Watch ""True Romance"" or Roger Avary's terrific ""Killing Zoe"" instead. If I could give rated it a zero I would have."
1,PIECE,"Wasted my time watching this one. It was written by the same guy who gave us the marvellous THE USUAL SUSPECTS. So I said to myself: let me give it a try. What a deception. Phillipe's acting is a joke, so bad it is. Everything seems third-rate production, copy, a remake. No way, pal, this movie is a loser."
1,"Pointless Plot, Flat Characters","The phrase, ""Written by Christopher McQuire"" no long holds any sway with me.Here we have characters with no substance what so ever. They exist soley to curse and kill people. (And I mean that in a bad way) Since we know nothing about them we feel nothing for them.There is a plot, but one that's ultimatly hollow. Criminals Phillipie and DelToro kidnap surigate mother Juleitte Lewis and hold her for ransom. The adoptive parents use their killer body guards Dey Diggs and James Cann to pursue with a slew of silly fight scenes.There is nothing redeeming I can find about this film. The plot is silly and the characters hollow."
1,pure garbage,"My friends and I stumbled on this movie at the video store last night. I can honestly say that it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Extremely bloody and extremely pointless! I am upset that I wasted two hours of my life on it. I will never get those two hours back - I could have been contemplating my navel, watching grass grow, exercising vigorously... basically anything would have been better than watching this misogynistic, homophobic piece of trash."
3,Great gunfight scene.,"The gunfight scene early in this film is fantastic, other than that, the only thing that kept my interest was seeing Benicio del Toro....I was kind of in a del Toro mood. Juliette Lewis is just awful. Ryan Phillipe is okay. Del Toro is okay and goodlooking. That's why I rented this film...but I could never sit through it again. If there had been more fantastic gun fight scenes instead of all the silly talk, and Juliette Lewis acting a fool, etc...I could have given it more stores. It only gets three stars because of del Toro."
4,A review from a slightly different point of view,"As the DVD is not out (more the pity) this review is on the move version. I went to see this, based soley on the direction/writer, and Benicio Del Toro. I came out thinking, what a great movie.Some may say it is mindless senceless violence, I say wrong,look again. All the violence is very directed, and to a point, no wasted energy. The plot twists, are entertaining, as in usual suspects. The movie does harken to sixties style movies, with the likes of Lee Marvin, and Steve Mcqueen.As a Full time firearms instuctor, for a metropolitin agency, I tip my hat to who ever did the weapons craft instruction to the actors, particulary Del Toro and Phillipe. No mistakes, real world pro moves, the first from a movie! Haveing seen a few real world bag men ( I hate bag men) I have to say Mr. Cann, and friends nailed that to a T. All and all, a damn good movie."
2,Do you want redemption or don't you?,"Parker and Longbaugh (Ryan Phillippe and Benecio del Toro) are two small-time hoods looking to score big by kidnapping a woman carrying a mobster's child. For some strange reason they act against their natures and common sense and decide to first let the girl go, then help her escape the clutches of the mobster who supposedly impregnated her. The Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid rip-offs (excuse me, *homages*) are apparent at points throughout, but especially obvious at the end.What a thematic mess. Don't have the main character give us the phony voice-over telling us he's not interested in redemption, after protecting a pregnant mother from ruthless mobsters for no other possible reason than to try to redeem himself from a life of killing and grifting. Don't try to have your protagonists be both the heroes and anti-heroes at the same time. Be one or the other.This is the only time Benecio del Toro hasn't been able to carry a movie. Some burdens are just too great."
2,"A few nice twists, but that's it.","""The Way of the Gun"" has a couple of unexpected twists, but for the most part, it's too little, too long. If you want a modern western with style, buy Antonio Banderas' ""Desperado"". Come to think of it, if Robert Rodriguez was at the helm, ""The Way of the Gun"" might have been a much better movie. As it is, this movie is hamstringed with a soap opera plot, unrealistic shootouts, and Ryan Phillippe mumbling through his ""tries-too-hard-to-be-cool"" dialog. You can't make a good movie if that's what you have to work with. And this isn't a good movie."
4,Overlooked,"I get the feeling there was alot of the story we're missing here; It hints at the possibility of being a truly epic crime story, with rich background stories and intricate plots to unfold. And while this is not the overall result, there are alot of really great moments in this quirky and well-acted crime drama. Ryan and Benicio are compelling leads, and Caan is excellent as an aging mobster. And, of course, it's really all about the big finish. Kind of a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid thing...This is one of those odd movies I just really liked."
4,A Different Sort Of Film,"This film is rife with gratuitous violence, filthy language, bloody fights, despicable people, disgusting situations, deplorable lifestyles and stomach-turning vignettes. I thought it was perfectly fine but my wife hated it."
2,"Good Acting, horrible movie.","This movie was silly. Some great performances and great actors were wasted. James Caan was great, but with the story so disjointed and boring scenes of shootings, I just didn't like this movie. The scenes with the baby being born and the chick all messed up being pregnant and her silly walk. Juliette Lewis was doing the best she could, she's just not that great. I was trying to like this movie, but other than some interesting acting I hated this movie. 2 stars because the actors tried."
1,Terrible,"Don't waste your money even renting this video. There were some great reviews on the back of the box, so I rented it, and it was written by the same guy who wrote ""The Usual Suspects,"" so I figured it might be good. I did not even finish...i watched for over an hour but I could not take the boredom any longer and I could not care less how it ended. Boring and pointless and completely uninteresting."
2,A COPY FROM A COPY FROM A COPY ....,"What to say here ? Total dissapointment. The guy who wrote ""THE USUAL SUSPECTS"" seems to have tried to copy Tarantino in his heyday ( because Tarantino is gonne for sure, he is a clever guy who copies everything, than mix it together in blood lust movies ). The result, of course, was catastrophic. Julliette Lewis plays the ""crazy, desorientated, criminal"" woman for the elventh time in her career (see ""NATURAL BORN KILLERS"", ""KALIFORNIA"" ). RYan Phillippe is bad as ever. The great failure in the director's idea was try to copy something that never was good (Tarantino)."
2,Not a Good Movie,"This movie was boring. The dialogue was unimaginative and stale. The language used was technical cold and uninspired. The plot had holes and too many entanglements to care about. Every person involved had some angle so no one was ever developed fully. The movie ointroduces the two main characters as ""petty thieves"" or ""small time crooks"", yet when the action begins they move and act as if they are ex-navy seals. Oh yeah, and apparently they are telepathic though that angle is never explored. Juliet Lewis did nothing but sceam throughout. I honestly can't think of one thing I liked about this movie."
3,A disappointment,"Good score, good acting on Benicio Del Tore's part, good cinematography. The story just doesn't pull all these pieces together. Definitely worth watching, but not a keeper."
4,Lots of Fun,"Highly entertaining and extremely well written. The writing alone makes the movie worth seeing. It has a great western feel as well that keeps things interesting throughout. My favorite line is one Juliette Lewis and Ryan Phillipe have with each other: Lewis-""I like bacon."" Phillipe-""Its from a gas station."" Lewis-""Its still good."" Some well choreographed gunfights, witty banter, great acting, and a terrific score elevate this flick from generic crime caper/b-movie to classic cult film status."
3,Worth it for Sara Silverman,"This film opens with one of the best and most original scenes in years: a crazed, vulgar party girl (Silverman) calls out Ryan Phillipe, believing that her boyfriend will fight for her. She goes on a horrific tirade, until Phillipe becomes fed up and punches her in the face. It's probably the only cinematic example of this common phenomena--loud girls starting fights that their reluctant boyfriends have to carry out; but it's subverted wonderfully. However, everything is downhill from this initial colorful scene. The rest of the movie is a slow, often ponderous and wholly convoluted story of two men abducting the pregnant surrogate mother of a shady millionare. Watch the sequence before the credits, don't worry too much about the rest."
5,The Way of the Gun [Blu-ray],"""The Way of the Gun"" is a great movie. I already had the dvd but the movie is so good i upgraded to the blu-ray."
3,"Entertaining Movie, Needed James Caan","I did enjoy this movie, but it would have been helped by just one thing, and that is if the producers had decided to include James Caan in the cast list. I think he would have been great in the part of the bag man, or even the mob boss, but the people that they had chosen for those parts were tired and unconvincing. I know that James Caan could have provided a better performance then them and I would have enjoyed the movie all the more if they had chose to include him. Other then that major problem with the movie I must say that I did enjoy the movie and would like to see the writer/director again, but if he does make another movie I hope that he choses to include James Caan. That would be cool to see them working together for the first time.James Caan Rules"
1,Waste of time....,"Just what civilization needs...more shoot-it-out silliness. Pretty unendurable, sensationalist script which sounds out of kilter. Has no redeeming value and the stupidity of it all are summarized by the last scene. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,A good kind of confusing,"I don't give this movie 5 stars only because I reserve that for movies like Traffic, which Del Toro is also in; nevertheless, I rented this movie and had to buy it. You might have to watch it twice to understand all of the ways in which the characters are tied to each other, and hence their motives, but I think it's worth it. I will admit, the different strands aren't tied in as seamlessly as in, say, The Usual Suspects. Still, there's something almost postmodern about this movie reminiscent of Nat'l Born Killers; you know, the kind of movie that shows how things are in ""real life"" without any explanations or apologies. Phillippe is surprisingly good, especially since usually I don't like the pretty boy types. Need we say anything about Benicio's performance? Everyone's acting offers something we may never have seen from them before, including Lewis and Caan. And if you like action movies with a lot of gun play, you will like this, too."
5,Bencio Del Toro is HOT HOT HOT,"This is a great movie, mainly becuase Benicio Del TOro is in it and he is truly a great actor. You won't be dissapointed. he was great in this movie as he was in Traffic and I loved him in The Usual Suspects. I don't want to give anything away, but this is worth buying if you are a fan."
1,EXPLAIN,"The Way of the Gun, aside from being utterly boring, is a complete mess. I doubt I've ever seen a more convoluted mess than this, in fact. At first it looks like the movie is trying to be a comedy - and it succeeds VERY nicely for the first 20 minutes or so! But just when you're enjoying yourself it switches gears out of the blue like it can't make up its mind, so now you have this grim crime story that is as interesting as dirty dishwater. When the violence comes, it is over-the-top like all such movies, but UNLIKE all such movies, it adds nothing into the mix. Hm, honestly, everything about this movie is bad once the first 20 minutes go by."
1,One Rotten Apple,"The title, the art work, Benicio Del Toro, same maker as Usual Suspects...I went into this movie with the greatest of expectations and walked out wondering if I could somehow get a refund. Overly dramatic acting and a completely mis-matched score makes this movie humorous to watch. Juliette Lewis delivers the only real performance, but it's still not enough to save this movie. Christopher McQuarrie tried using John Woo's gun scenes accompanied by a Shawshank Redemption-style score in the background. It just doesn't work. The marketing of this picture looks interesting, but the content is sub-par at best."
2,a cold gun,"interminable, doom-laden saga of freelance badmen, mafia badmen and corporate badmen whom no one would want to know or care about. that's not such a bad thing but in the quest for simulacrum tarantino the one crucial ingredient is humor, and this film has none. for that i blame chris mcquarrie, who penned both the usual suspects and this but unfortunately took on the directing chores himself on this one. mcquarrie's sense of humor makes ben stein seem like bill hicks. the usual suspects, at least, had a kind of gallows sensiblity that distracted you from the plot. here that humor doesn't exist and so you're forced to pay attention to the story, which is about as barren as the morals of the characters. now that's not such a bad thing either, but without all the in-jokes, hip cultural decorating and cool movie homages, the whole thing just collapses under the weight of it's own nastiness and banality."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Way of the Gun does so many interesting things that it's almost worth recommending, but it also has so many flaws--including but not limited to poor pacing and occasionally convoluted plotting--that it remains more of an interesting failure than an accomplished film; you're better off renting than buying."
5,Saviours of Metal!,"Finally a band going back to straight up old school thrash. Shadows Fall are the best band in heavy music today. This album will go down in history as a thrash classic along wiith master of Puppets, Reign iin Blood and Rust in Peace. Some say they are death metal, but they are far beyond unintelligent grunts for vocals. Although sometimes singer Brian Fair likes to scream, he proves he can really sing on the title track and the pink Floyd cover. Buy it."
4,The Art of Balance is pretty Steady,"The Latest album By Shadows Fall ""The Art of Balance"" Shows great talent in musicianship and lyrical work. The Art of Balance mixes a variety of older soudning metal with a lot of hardcore. Id call this cd a Metalcore or Melodic Hardcore album. Its a great album and you all should buy it! The cover of Pink Floydd's ""Welcome to the Machine"" is great, a little bit more guitar in the cover. But, the new Hard-hitting album starts off with a blast of guitar and percussion in the first track IDLE HANDS.Shadows Fall is a great band and will definitely have a future. If you are into bands like Killswitch Engage,Lamb of God,Meshuggah, and Metalicca fans, this album would be appropriate for you!"
3,"A Solid Album, Good Headbanging","This is a good, solid, headbanging album thats perfect for the weekend when your picking up your friends and going out to party. Reminds me of my early days popping in Testament's Souls of Black or Megadeth's Peace Sells albums. Overall good albums but not GREAT, which is why I gave it 3 stars. Shadows Fall's songs are good refreshing metal, but theres nothing on this album that reaches out and ingrains itself in your head. Don't get me wrong this album doesn't suck but it seems more like a stepping stone for Shadows Fall to become something really great. If they stay together they could accomplish a GREAT album instead of a GOOD album, which is what The Art of Balance is.....A GOOD album...Not Great. 3 stars"
