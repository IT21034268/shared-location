2,Much Ado . . .,". . . About Very Little. John Woo heaps so much care and (seeming) intelligence on such trash. He has studied all the masters so carefully, and added his own touches to create such overblown kitschy rubbish that it almost makes one sick. Add to it the outrageous claims of Woo's fans (no other word for them) and you have what could have been an enjoyably amusing shoot-em-up transformed into a painfully pretentious shoot-em-up. And Chow Yun Fat is easily the worst excuse for a movie star since Whoopi Goldberg."
3,Sellers description of product was not 100% accurate,"The DVD came from Blockbuster...I'm guessing one of the locations went out of business and the DVD was bought and resold. The DVD itself was in decent condition, not very good as was described. The case itself is cracked and has a chip taken out of it. Overall, the DVD seems to work fine, but for how long? I don't think I'm going to purchase from this company again."
5,For John Woo Fans,The killer has more action in the first minute than most action films have in the first hour. Don't miss this gem!
5,Help me please.,"I saw this movie a couple years ago. My father had rented the movie and I scoffed at it thinking, ""its just another one of those cheesy hong kong shooter movies."" I was dead wrong. To this day I still can remember how much of an experience it was to watch this movie, but alas I just cannot find this movie on DVD. I searched the net engines and just cant find it. If anyone knows where I can buy this movie please email me at jnguyen@choate.edu. Id really really appreciate it from one ""killer"" fan to another."
5,See it to believe it.,"THE KILLER is probably the most visually orgasmic film I have ever seen. The action takes place at break-neck speed, but often slows to the all-too-familiar Hollywood slow-motion style. Oops. Actually, Hong Kong cinema invented the slo-mo and John Woo is its most gifted expositor. Though he has used it less successfully in his American films (FACE/OFF, the awful BROKEN ARROW), Woo's techniques were honed in Hong Kong, and best displayed in this 1989 action masterpiece. The colors in the film are brilliant and jarring. The action in this film is visceral and cathartic. The story has some interesting twists, but the main attractions here are the all-out gun battles that shred the screen. Easily better than 99% of American action films, THE KILLER is a great vehicle for a pre-CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON/REPLACEMENT KILLERS Chow Yun-Fat. This film has to be seen to be believed.Essential."
3,English Dubbed Sucks,"The sound quality and the translation quality really sucks, not like the original movie. Even though I can't speak or understand a word in chinese it was an amazing movie but the tone of voice and the sound quality. They ruined this movie with the dubbing and sound quality. I recomend watching the original to have the full effect of the movie."
5,This movie has everything,"You laugh, you say, ""Whoa cool!,"" you cry, but mostly you say, ""whoa Cool!"" Anyways...Jeffrey (Chow) is a hired killer and is pretty cool. Until one killer evening, he accidently blinds a nightclub singer, and does one last job to pay for her eye operation. Howvever, things don't go as planned, when both sides of the law are after him.Logic does not play a big part of this movie, action does. So don't go expecting a realistic movie, instead expect a supurbly done action-drama. The last scene in the church is one for the record books. The best part of the movie (in my humble opinion of course) is when the Mary statue is blown up and this very sad music plays, very good. Another great masterpiece from the collaberation of John Woo/Chow Yun-Fat."
4,"Very good, but not a masterpiece","I can't agree with the reviewers who get all misty over the human dimension of this film. I found it to be a very lightweight story--an intricate mesh of cliches buoyed by some pretentious imagery. The film's considerable power lies in the staging of the action scenes and Woo's confident use of the camera. They transcend the story and some of the more absurd elements of the action (ie, handguns that fire more bullets than most police departments could afford) and give iconic power to the characters. It's empty, but very entertaining to watch."
5,Daniel Ash - Coming Down.,"This is a wonderful album from an underated, talented and unique artist. If you are a fan of Bauhaus, Tones On Tail, Love & Rockets. Then you will appreciate Daniel's Ash's solo albums. The man is genuine no matter what he creates. Anyone who listens to his music is in for a real treat."
3,Nice mild cologne but fades fast!,"Had this cologne before,decided to repurchase after not having for couple yearsSmell is excellent but extremely mildFades fast,can spray and spray, soon fades within hoursProbably go with better quality next timeRecommend look elsewhere"
4,slow praise,"William's writing is concise and comprehensible. These are two qualities that are hard to come by in texts that deal with complex, spiraling debates on the historical nature of abstract concepts. Williams organizes chronological configurations of thought such that they fall back over themselves throughout the book. The chapters on modernism and idealism are particularly engaging."
4,A cinematic gem; one of Fassbinder's best.,"Fassbinder creates a masterpiece of cinematic literature: With the richness of black and white shades that mirror the printed work and the subtle textures of a film style reminiscent of turning pages, Fontane's novel of Wilhelmian society is presented as ""Literature for the Big Screen."" A work which explores social duty and opression with melodramatic flavor, whether you are a fan of soaps, a student of literature or film, or simply someone with an appreciation for aesthetic appeal there is something to be enjoyed, if not truly savored, from the experience of Effi Briest."
3,A good voyage into morals of 19th century,"This movie is probably more ""conventional"" of all Fassbinder's movies I have seen. However, I liked the way it was done. The story itself left an indelible impression of me, apart from its cinematographic strengths and weaknesses. I think it portrayed bourgeois Germany of 19th century with its hypocritical morals very well. The very reason why Effi was cast out of society and rejected by her parents seems to be absurd for a modern viewer, and I trust that Fassbider wanted to examine exactly that. The personal drama of Effi, the mother who comes to hate her own daughter, I think is very powerful. I believe it's a good tribute by Fassbinder into studies in German society and its culture. A very much worthwhile film, interesting to compare this handling of an issue with Bergman's dealing with similar issues. This is definitely not a Hollywood style movie. Recommended."
2,"Stylized, wooden, and ""arty""","Stylized, wooden, and ""arty"". . .I don't know how well 21st century viewers would respond to this slow-moving, predictable story.By stylized i mean that people stand motionless around when it is not their turn to talk, people are repeatedly shown not directly but reflected in a mirror, people face away when talking instead of looking at the person they are addressing. Then there is the trick of showing people in one room through the doorway from another room. Effi ALWAYS talks gently and sweetly, regardless of the occasion. Her husband always talks calmly, rationally, and slowly, even about a duel that may cost his life. And there are many other such manneristic tricks.I know that other viewers liked the movie but i found it wooden, pretentious, and phony."
2,"took forever to assemble, not real sturdy","We bought this because it seemed like it was cheaper for the same product as other retailers. However, it took FOREVER to put together - SO many pieces, and the shelves within are cardboard, not metal. The whole thing itself needs to be anchored to the wall or it is not very sturdy."
5,Best Salami ever!,This is the best salami -- very unique! The Parmesan cheese coating is delicious! Wish I could find this product closer to home.
5,Ophie out of oz,"I am [..] and in the [...]and love this book. It is infact one of my favorites. When Ophie Peeler moves from sunny california to rainy oregon and goes to a new school where she wants to show her talents and fit in,the two popular "" T.V. girls"" are stealing her stardom and making her life difficult.,and her precious ruby red slippers dont fit her anymore! Yet she meets Brittany borg and her little sister Tana who are nice and accept Ophie for who she is, even though brittany is the weird girl in the class ,ophie becomes her friend. When the T.V girls finaly let Ophie into their group only because of one reason, Ophie will have to choose between Brittany,tana and the T.V. girls. Will Ophie ever feel at home? This is a must read book for most kids in 3rd to maybe [...]rade. You must get it!"
5,Cordelia Gray does her thing!,"I have listened to this dramatization several times since purchasing it in 1990 and have enjoyed this atomsopheric suspense mystery immensely. P.D. James ability to give all her characters faults, insecurities, and occasional selfishness once again serves her well in this mystery. The characters are as developed as possible in the space of a 3 hour radio play. The atmosphere created on the island is just incredible, spooky, and just what you would expect in that setting. The character of Cordelia Gray is very well developed over the course of this story and her other adventure, ""An Unsuitable Job For a Woman."" I consider these two stories to be my favorite P.D. James mysteries. I strongly recommend these to all P.D. Jmaes fans as cracking good yarns and very entertaining."
3,Entertaining but not exceptional English mystery,"Cordelia Gray is hired to bodyguard a bad tempered actress who has been receiving death threats. They travel to an island off the southern coast. The notes continue. Of the group on the island, almost all have some reason to hate the actress or want her money.This is a pretty classic closed room mystery in the Agatha Christie mold. Cordelia is a fairly engaging slueth. As best I can tell, this is the end of the Cordelia Gray series. Too bad.The audio cassette performance is in the tradition of old time radio with multiple voices and sound effects. It's a bit confusing to keep track of who's who but not too confusing. I recommend trying to listen in one sitting, if you can."
4,A Murder(?) in Venice,"It was not on purpose that I purchased another book set in the facinating city of Venice. If I get any more of these books, I will have to take it as a sign to travel to Italy and spend a few weeks in Venice.This is a murder mystery, but you are not really sure that there really is a murder at all. The death under question does not happen until over half way though the book and it is only at the very end that we get our answer as to whether it was or was not.A very good book."
1,Boring and a mistake,"Ok, I would have never picked up this book in the first place but someone suggested that I read it. Come to find out, they wanted me to read a completely different book by the same name. But I read this because once I start I have a hard time just stopping a book. It was horrible. Nothing remotely interesting even happened until chapter 18, and by then I thought I was going to drown myself in the baby pool I was sitting in. I couldn't believe that someone would actually suggest this book and then I found out that they didn't! And neither will I. If the rest of Donna Leon's books are like this one I will never pick up one of her books again."
4,Very Informative,"This book examines how Mao's hatred of intellectuals resulted in the torture and murder of millions. The author explores the events leading up to the Cultural Revolution, how and why it happened, and the aftermath of a tragic decade in Chinese history. Because this book is based on interviews conducted with people who lived through the Cultural Revolution, it gives a lot of insight into what was going on in the minds of the Chinese populace. There are many remarkable stories here of cowardice & heroism, cruelty & kindness, suicide & the awesome determination to survive. This book is a must for anyone wanting to better understand the Chinese people and the Cultural Revolution."
2,A chilling view...,"I found the whole idea to be believable but that the Draka were too good. They seldom if ever (I have read the entire series) make serious mistakes and seldom lose....The technological progress I didn't think was in fitting with a slave society mind set (think of Rome) Too many of the Draka tech advantages were as a result of civilian market research in the real world, not a priorty focus in a slave society. Though I read them and in the main enjoyed the read, the fact the Draka were ALWAYS so successful took alot from the storyline. I found The Chosen was a better thought out story and did not have all the weaknesses of the Draka series."
4,"Modest, but the beginning...","Well, for all intents and purposes, this novel was the most modest and simple, as far as explaning how the Draka are. However, most of it was about soldiers in battle; it could have been describing any other battle in any war in human history, just the names and technology change. When in war, we normally don't care for the other side's way of life.Within the entire series, although simple, it's worth reading again."
3,Could have been better,Overall I enjoyed this book. I was recently rereading it for the forth or fifth time when I realized why I did not like the book more. The Draka not only seem to be infallible but are too technologically advanced. It seems to me that if the Draka were soadvanced the Nazis should have been closer to that technological level. There is also a bit too much lesbian/bisexuality in the female characters. It doesn't seem realistic. I also fail to believe that Hitler would have allowed the Draka to overrun Italy. Hitler was very fond of Mussolini. Hitler even sent commandos to rescue him from captivity during WWII. Eric von Shrakenberg's century of paratroopers just seem to do too good of a job repelling the attacks of the Waffen SS.
1,Alternate History shouldn't be a veneer,"This book is at it's most basic a poor war story in which theDraka(Spartan-Confederate-Nazis desendend from Loyalists from theRevolutionary war)attack the Soviet Union in Georgia during the Soviet attack on the Nazis(Odd, but even after almost 200 years since the Point of Divergence from our history, the two are almost identical). The stays with the perspective of a Draka solider with an American journalist fighting in a mountain town against Nazis with 1990s tech against Germans with 1940s tech. Periodically, exerts from Anna von Shrakenburg's(the solider's illegitamate child with a slave/""serf"" who lives in America aided by the Friends society) book about her life there, which comes to nothing..."
4,"""Omen"" Parody","This is immediately familiar as an Omen take-off. The kid is intelligent, and there is a subtext about him despising his yuppie parents and preferring chaos and destruction to the anomie and hypocrisy that his parents have embraced. A key line, delivered early in the movie, has the parents say to each other, (paraphrase): These people we hang out with are superficial, and we are part of their crowd. Initially, upon a superficial viewing, one will find oneself sympathizing totally with the (very attractive) parents: Vera Farmiga was the female lead in ""The Departed,"" which was thrilling, and Sam Rockwell is known from Charlie's Angels and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" an interesting, if fictive, work [despite the authors claim that it is a memoir] and is a likable and pleasant presence.However, upon reflection, you realize that the kid's project of rebellion may, at least, be understandable, if not admirable."
1,You wouldn't want to have kids after watching this.,"Very similar to the movie Omen, which you want to just squeeze the kid. NOT Entertaining, but a film to show someone so they don't have kids."
1,"Boring, borderline pretentious and painful","Opting for greatness, does not make things great. Shades of Rosemary's Baby, Birth and other Manhattan psychological thrillers have inspired this to tedium. Nothing really ever happens. Lots of noisy post-partum screaming, discordant and overplayed piano music, constant infant crying and grimacing all add together like some expensive pharmaceutical ad for a migraine pill. Run away."
4,creepy......,a modern day omen but without the whole devil thing.......creepy kid played by an excellent little actor ......i loved that it was creepy without all the blood & gore.....just a good psycological creepy thriller..........vera farmiga i just love her....no matter what she is in shes great.....and i love how the dynamics of the family structure slowly gets worse...........good movie...worth the watch.....
2,"See ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" Instead","I generally love a good ""evil child"" movie; this one, however, was the PITS. It was hard to not actually feel sorry for creepy little Joshua, what with having the world's most self-centered parents and all. I can't recall a character more insufferable than Abby, and if I had a mother like that I'd be a sociopathic lunatic, too. Dad wasn't any better."
3,"Creepy, but not scary","I definitely wouldn't call this movie ""suspenseful"". And the ending didn't ""keep me guessing"". The basic gist of the movie is a tried-and-true mantra: little kids can be extremely creepy. Just like other movies with this schematic (Children of the Corn, 6th Sense), we are led to believe that the little ones we love just might be evil. There are no monsters or devils or cool special effects in this movie. In fact, there isn't really any elusion to anything paranormal, which makes this even creepier. Basically, it's just about a really bad (and smart) kid who attempts to ruin everybody's life. I thought that the ending really lacked any type of closure, and the boy's character would have been better with a little building of anger instead of the good-one-day-bad-the-next development. On the plus side, it does have a few genuinely freaky scenes (the boy using the video camera).Overall, this was an okay movie, I wouldn't pay more than $7 to own it though."
2,hardly a stand out film in its genre,"I can definitely see why this movie bombed at screenings and was released straight to DVD even after Fox Searchlight invested an arm and a leg for it at Sundance. Not only is the movie a downer, it also is unable to truly find a genre or its own niche. It's the kind of movie that has unidentifiable characters and an air of absurdity about it, although it's only really an exaggeration of what undoubtedly does take place. At the end of the day, The Omen succeeds much better in the psychological thriller that describes evil children. Having said that, it also bears saying that all performances are outstanding, particularly those of Sam Rockwell and Vera Farmiga."
2,"Starts out promising, ends with unanswered questions","My daughter and I really wanted to like this. We thought it would be like the movie The Bad Seed. However, we were left just being disappointed. It starts out well with you questioning whether Joshua is a sociopath, abused child, or if the parents are the ones with the issues. The second half of the movie goes in all sorts of different directions. The ending leaves more questions than you started with. My daughter, who is 19, loves all these types of movies and is very forgiving of ones that are not all that good, and she thought this was terrible. We agree with the review that states the movie can't decide what it wants to be."
4,You've gotta get this one!!!,"14:59 along with extra songs!!! If you like ""Sugar Ray"", you'll like this!!!"
4,Addicted to Prison Break,I totally love the show. I would stay up all night watching the episodes to see what would happen next. I got the whole family hooked on it. Can't wait for new episodes!
5,One Of The Best Shows on TV Today!!!,"With a great cast and action, Prison Break has emerged in it's two years on the air, as a superb thrill ride.If you thought season one was great, you'll love season two as it ups the ante in all areas.Give Robert Knepper an emmy!"
5,prison break is great,the dvd was in great shape. I had no problem watching them. the x-tras were great.I had areally good time watching them.tim
3,not so bad ..,"This season of Prison Break is not as thrilling as the first one but there're some great moments. One of the most interesting characters is Alexander Mahone, the kind of complex and dark character we want to know everything about. This season two is not unforgettable, but pleasant anyway."
5,BEST SHOW EVER!!!!,I absolutely love this show it is so unbelievably exciting so edge of your seat. I think all the characters and story lines of this season are great. The writers and producers i give great praise to for making a great show. I cant wait for season 3.I highly recommend this show to all!!!
5,Best TV-serie ever!,"I am a fan of several TV-series, such as CSI Miami,NCIS,Deadwood (in this order), but none of them compares to Prison Break! I have only seen the first part of second season so far, but it`s really breath-taking.Interesting and original story, a lot of suspense and good actors (okay, Dominic Purcell has been better as Dracula, but anyway)I have also seen the first 4 seasons of 24, but Prison Break is much, much better!"
5,Visual Addiction,"What a cracker. This is to television what drugs are to an addict. My wife and I were riveted from the off. This was a piece where character development was steady, story line ebbed and flowed, suspense was maintained and the high standard from series one was actually exceeded. When series 1 ended, the question that sprung to mind was 'Prison's broken, police on your heels, c'mon get real?'. The ensuing hunt, the introduction of new equally flawed characters (on both sides of the legal spectrum) and and the puzzle that is Michael Schofield (and his tattoos) made this more unmissable than series 1. Do yourself a favour, take out the popcorn, sit yourself down and enjoy."
4,"No season 1, but still amazing.","Season one was definitely better, it kept you watching and eager for the next episode. However, season 2 still contains that suspense and thrill Prison Break is known for. It has the same characters we all know and love, just in a different setting. It has the same clever plot lines and surprising twists that you will never see coming. This season will keep you on the edge of your seat. Definitely worth buying."
5,prison break,prison break is one of the best TV shows on the air and this is a good way to get to view it again and again.......i reccomenit highly....
4,"Great, but..","This 2nd its almost as good than first. The bad thing is the 5th world image of Mexico, old ways, buses, etc.and the poor Mexican geography knowledge of the writers (Sinaloa-Chiapas-Guerrero, its not a logical way of Sucre. But, on the rest is good"
5,One of the Best Shows Ever!,"Prison Break is a suspeneful show with tons of twist and turns. Me and my Husband would have marathons one episode after another because each episode leaves you looking forward to the next. I introduced my family to this show and now they are hooked! Wentworth Miller is the perfect leading man, Im sure you ladies will love him also!"
4,No Blu-ray!?!,This is my favorite season of the show and I'm disappointed it's not in blu-ray!Just don't understand why FOX decided to release seasons 1 & 3 on blu-ray but only release seasons 2 & 4 on DVD. Very upset.
3,Absurdly entertaining,"That just about sums up the whole Prison Break experience. In spite of the utter absurdity of the plot throughout this series, it still manages to entertain.Of course it could have been a whole lot better had someone bothered to incorporate just a wee tad of credibility here and there. As it is, I am somehow left with a sort of guilty feeling of having derived a certain enjoyment after having watched such utter tosh over so many idle hours.It beggars belief that the producers of this show could have permitted just about every possible impossibility in the book to occur in this series - but then I suppose that's showbiz.It's been one hell of a ride so far - but if Series 3 continues in the same vein I'll probably throw up before the end.By the way, is it possible to get from Chicago to Panama BY BOAT?"
3,Big Drop-Off from Season One,"The plots lines develop too quickly in this season and the slowly building suspense from season one is gone by the end of season two. The timing of the different stories is too ridiculous to track. I suspend my belief of reality quite a bit for shows like these but this season of Prison Break asked too much of me.With that said, it remains one of the better shows on television, thanks to the superb acting and character development -- particularly T-bag and Michael. I hope this season is simply a blip in a longer running great series. I hope."
5,Really twisted,"Now this is one TV drama action (soap? as it continues) thriller that is so unpredictable. Who gets killed, framed? I cant wait for Season 3!"
3,Not too great,"The discs inside of the case all worked well and they looked new, but the case itself was crushed and had many creases, even though the condition said very good"
1,Dissapointed,"I bought it because CD Now always have sent to me the best records, with the best music, in terms of jazz contanining; I was fooled with the reviews, and I don't share that concepts; I neither think it's funk, not jazz, not good music; ok good sound, but anyway i'm really dissilussioned with the result; now I can open a spin-gym and offer that stuff to my customers. That's what i'll do.RODOLFO GONZALEZ"
4,Metro Area - Metro Area,"Blippy electro-disco from Morgan Geist (one of the forefathers of the movement) and his partner-in-crime Darshan Jesrani under their moniker Metro Area. The tracks display nice blend of different elements, from deep house to Chicago-style disco house (with a extended stay in Detroit). The clear and unabashed love of funk (listen to the tootling voices on ""Miura"" or the old-skool rhythms on ""Soft Hoop"") also add a sense of fun. There's also a polished smoothness (like on ""Machine Vibe"" and ""Orange Alert""). The simplicity of the songs both adds to their charm and makes them difficult to differentiate from one another, but still, for your late night pleasures, you'll want to make a visit to this metro area."
5,BEAUTIFULLY ROMANTIC AND INSPIRATIONAL,THIS IS THE FIRST CD I HAVE HEARD SUNG BY TONY VEGA AND I CAN'T GET ENOUGH.
2,Didn't like it,"Okay, it's a decent book for someone who's never heard of the word 'economy,' but it's so opinion-driven that it can't even define a word without using a paragraph completely full of abstractions. It's a book that's made to look pretty but not for an economics major (in my opinion). Having had more advanced classes, this book seems like it's written for a high schooler by a guy who likes to look out the window and let his mind wander.It is a pretty book; it's got a lot of pictures, graphs, and cartoons to illustrate it, and it does bring in a lot of current events for the reader to see what's going on and how it relates to economics, but really, as short as the chapters are and as nice as the pictures were, I could not take this seriously even through the first few chapters."
3,easy to understand and well written - but be cautious,"Be cautious because the author is opinionated about certain controversial issues, and he puts them forth as fact. I even question the way he uses some graphs and analyses; some of them are so in depth, that I really don't have the time to break them down and expose what I think are fallacies - I dont' have the luxury of that kind of time! With that said, however, I have definitely learned a lot from this book. I am very impressed with the authors ability to explain some pretty complicated areas of economics in a manner that should be easy to understand by all. He is even at times funny, which is nice. You will learn a lot from this book - just be sure to read critically and don't take everything he says as fact!"
3,"Basic, no frills vocab book","One of the older vocab. books originating in the early 1990s. Categorization of words and phrases into 56 different topics arranged alphabetically, from Accidents, Adornments, Animals, Art, to Food... Clothings, Weather.No exercises, no pictures, a no frills vocab book. I used it in the 1990s and found it quite good. But today, you have better alternatives."
2,And There Went My Time,"With all due respect I give the director and cast credit for producing a gay film but this is like a bad ABC Aftenoon School Special. The acting is pretty bad and the story drags. I would recommend renting this first if you can, it's not worth the money to buy."
2,And Then Came Disappointment,"This is another film that has its heart in the right place... the filmmakers, cast and crew wanted to make a pretty film about the tribulations of coming out and being gay. But, sadly, they don't back it up with anything to put some meat on the film's bones. The script just wanders, the acting is terribly amateurish, and the camerawork just clunks. Worst of all, the film's treatment of women is unintentionally hysterical and borderline offensive. The funniest moment on the DVD? Watch the interview with the lead actor... he thinks he's Tom Cruise."
1,bad BaD BAD!,"I am trying to find at least one positive thing I could write about this film...Hmmm, the actor who potrayed Tommy is handsome. And that's it.Everything is horrible here. Acting (a piece of wood would have played some characters better...), script (tedious), music - HORRIBLE.It's one of the movies I will always regret spending time on watching it."
1,Amateur Hour,"May be one of the most listless films ever made. Deadly dull dialogue, wooden acting, stilted camera work and an unimaginative story. The plot meanders without pace, direction or meaningful character development. The writer has something to say about tolerance toward gays and lesbians, but his film is so bland that it's hard to care. This film is stuck on the notion that small town life and values are superior the city's, so that I half expected a religious theme to develop, and sure enough as the credits rolled by, a quavering voice sang a peculiar song about, ""There's room for everyone at Jesus' table."" The message is fine - just awkwardly introduced. That's a good word for the whole film, awkward."
1,"DULL, DULL DULL",I SNORED THREOUGH THIS ONE. THE TWO MALE LEADS HAD NO ACTING ABILITY AND WERE NOT AT ALL ATTRACTIVE. DON'T WASTE YOUT TIME OR MONEY ON THIS ONE OR YOU'LL BR SAYIN THE I WAS ROBBED.
1,The film that lowered the bar on bad film making,"This has to be the worst film I have ever seen. I bought this movie because of some of the comments posted here. Do not waste your time or money on this dismal movie. I made myself finish watching it because I paid for it. That and the fact that I didn't think it could get any worse. It does.If I ever see a bad film now, I rate it compared to this. No film comes even close. This saying in my house now is...""Well at least it wasn't as bad as 'And Then Came Summer'."
4,I'm glad I stumbled across this title......,"I was searching other titles, and I always like to click on the titles under ""customers who bought this also bought this..."" and i read about it and decided to pick it up. What a pleasant surprise!!! You can tell the budget was not substantial, but it seems like there were a lot of people who put in a lot of time and energy to make this the best film possible. The photography is nice, the acting is great, and the direction is wonderful, albeit some scenes seemed to go on a bit long. The end was very intense, and a bit melodramatic, but it tugged at my heartstrings, and I had to pull out the tissues. A touching story which made me enter the actors' and director's name into IMDB to try to find other projects theyve done. Highly recommended!!!!"
5,Slaughter Fear No Evil,"This is an excellent CD for fans of Slaughter to buy,all the songs are great."
4,Very underrated album........,"After their last album (""The Wild Life"") and the changing music scene, most bands like Slaughter just faded away. But this album proves they were going nowhere. While this is better than ""The Wild Life"", it's not up to the standards ""Stick It To Ya"" set. ""Fear No Evil"" reminds me of Firehouse's third album: It has around 5-6 REALLY good songs, and they rest is filler. ""Breakdown 'N' Cry"" & ""Searchin'"" are songs that could've been SOOO much better. They are very disappointing. On to the good, as there is much more of that......""Like There's No Tomorrow"", ""Get Used To It"", & ""Let The Good Times Roll"" are just good rockers. ""It'll Be Alright"" is the best cut here, in my opinion. It's a great ballad, but doesn't get too sappy. ""Hard Times"" & ""Yesterday's Gone"" are the next best ones. Give them a listen. You will instantly love Slaughter again. I highly recommend this CD. You just might be skipping over a few songs, though."
3,Not their greatest record...,"This CD is not particularly outstanding.With ""Mars Needs Guitars"" the Hoodoo Gurus' ability to write catchy lightweight guitar-pop was quite evident. Their songs on THAT CD were a terrific, fun set with a cute 1960s surfsey influence.The songs in THIS record, while still listeneable are nowhere near as inspired or as memorable. Kinky's not a complete waste of money, but there are better HG records around."
3,Nice Old gospel jazz album,"What an old album. i was 8 in 1990 when this album came out. I am 27 now. the only reason i brought this cd was because i saw it in FYE store and they were selling it for $2 used. the songs on this album are nice. but the beats was during the time when, Mc Hammer, New Edition, Commission and BeBe and CeCe beats were still hot. and everyone was still wearing high top-fades or box hair cuts, back then. when i hear some of the songs it does take me back. i had a lot of fun in those years eventhough i was young. but if u like to go back, sometimes then knock yourself out with this album."
4,Muy funcional,"Poseo una camara olympus evolt 510 con dos lentes y varios accesorios y el bolso es perfecto para llevar todo, el tripode que trajo viene en un estuche aparte que no entra en el bolso, pero es liviano y nada dificil de transportar."
2,Not really a joy,I bought the book to find some interesting points in teaching kids chemistry in elementary school. Didn't really help me. Nothing new. I wouldn't really recommend it.
4,Easy reading but makes you think!,"This is a pretty easy read, the exercises are great and there are warnings about protective equipment to ensure you do not fall foul of any of the nasties you are handling (not that they are all that nasty).The coverage is about senior high school level - and my senior high school years are 40 years behind me - so I enjoyed the refresher.The complexity builds are you progress, but it is easy stages, so don't be daunted, dive right in - I did!"
1,joy of chemistry,"Full of irrelevant and banal quotes from various novels, only the most common and well-known demonstrations. Many attempts to be ""cute"", comparisons to other ""Joy of..."" books. A few things were actually incorrect.I was disappointed."
4,Holds up surprisingly well,"Just received the CD - I'm now listening to this album for the first time in . . . . oh . . . probably fifteen years and it's still amazingly enjoyable. Actually, my original vinyl LP was the english language variant with lyrics by Peter Hammill (is that version available anywhere?). And while I was a huge Hammill and VDGG fan I found the lyrics very clumsy and a detriment to the music. Hearing the original version now (even though I don't speak Italian)I realize what a good prog album this was. Moody and melodic, it reminds me more of the ""Nursery Chryme / Foxtrot"" era Genesis if I had to compare to any other prog cornerstone. Well worth picking up."
3,A Bit Heavy On Atmosphere,"Le Orme is a fondly-remembered Italian progressive band from the 70's. Since they were a trio with keyboards and no guitar, they have been frequently compared to ELP. Felona e Sorona is their attempt at a concept album. Since they sing in Italian you either understand the language or enjoy the atomshpere. And of the latter there is plenty. In my opinion even too much. Wedged between the 3 minute songs there are long slow instrumental workouts that serve to sonically ""describe"" the two opposite planets Sorona e Felona. And although these instrumental pieces are very evocative, they feel very long and boring. Instead of feeling like songs, they feel like special effects, to the detriment of the music in my opinion."
4,Buy two,"My granddaughter liked it. In fact, she reminded me that I had already bought her a copy so it seems that I also liked it. We kept the second copy and she gave it to a friend."
3,not what i thought,"i thought it was going to be about AMERICAN sports, but its from the U.K. apparently...where ""football"" is soccer and it has lots of things about cricket...not exactly what i was looking for, but...it just would've been nice to know before i bought it..."
2,Awesome! More than I expected!,"I got this gun thinking it was going to be O.K. and soon came to realize after shooting it and adding all of the supplies, it was a kick butt gun. I dont think it could have turned out any better for me."
5,I've had this gun for 3 months,and it still works perfectly..I really wish they made it in clear then i could see when it jams
1,SUCKS MADD,what did you say my gun just got here sounds great sweet scope a flash light a huge clip this thing is great but wait a minut why cant i shoot more than 1 pellet at a time? oh becasue this gun is a hunk of garbage
5,One of the most Underrated shows of our day,"Braceface is a unique series featuring real-life situations and problems with usually good and sometimes funny outcomes. Very entertaining for anyone of any age, be it teenagers with similar problems as featured in the show or adults who wish to revist those awkward times. This cartoon should go down as one of the best animated series of the decade."
3,Gift gone bad,"This item was for my 12 year old son for Christmas. When he opened it, the neck of the guitar was broken in two. Bummer that we found Christmas morning, but called Amazon the following day and they immediately sent out a new one within 2 days.This one came with 2 strings broken. Weird that more people aren't complaining about defects... Maybe it's because it was the holidays and the quality inspection was overlooked?? Luckily, broken strings are easily fixed. Needless to say, the string quality isn't the best and needs upgrading. I would grade it less than 3 stars (low quality); however, my son absolutely loves the look and the size. He would generously give it 5 stars."
4,A LESSON ON HUMAN NATURE,"I've recently been reading the book Amistad . I think that it is a good book. I think that people should try reading it some time. It would be a good experience for them, and I think that if people try reading this book it would teach them a lesson on human natureIf we all treated each other like they did on the book, we would be doomed and like I learned in one of my classes an eye for eye would make the whole world blindWhile I hope you all try reading it some time in your life."
3,Home Improvement for Dummies,"While this book did not cover the subject that I was interested it, it did contain many interesting project to think about. It is a good source when you are thinking about making some improvements to your home."
3,A nice mix,"This CD has a nice mix of classic film scores. The sound quality is not as high as other compilations in this genre. However, many of the selections on the CD are hard to find, so it's well worth the low low price."
3,a rich embarassment,"sometimes a collection doesn't do right by its parts. and even though this collection is made up of selections from the arguably finest cd collection of classic film music, this doesn't whet the appetite or heighten curiosity.it does feature a couple of selctions that are difficult to find, such as 'dance of the seven veils' from 'salome'. but other than that, a real afficionado might be better off collecting each of the discs this wonderful music comes from and giving this as a stocking stuffer."
1,"If you are not Fundamentalist Christian, don't bother","I couldn't wade past the heavily Christian Fundamentalist sentiment. Advice like -- Go before the Lord and ask what kind of hours and schedule He would have you set -- was too much for me. I don't know about her Lord, but my Lord gave me intelligence to make such decisions."
1,The Basic Steps to Successful Homeschooling,"To use the author's words, ""After time spent in the Word and with the Lord, I knew that speaking out for Him was what He called me to do"". I feel this sentiment was the author's first and foremost reason for writing this book with the subject of homeschooling coming second.Still she has some good very basic ideas, if you can wade through the other messages. I would probably not buy this book had I known of the overtly strong Christian theme."
2,Well-written but does not include everything necessary in high school geometry.,"Although the book's approach is good, it omits a lot of theorems, mostly those involving circles. The book emphasizes too much coordinate geometry. I recommend this book for self-study, but it is clearly not intended to be a textbook to cover all the material in a standard high school geometry course."
3,Kindle Price a rip-off!,"I teach Geometry with this book, and initially one of the reasons I wanted the Kindle was so that I could download this book. I downloaded the sample not longer after getting my Kindle, but I wasn't ready to pay the price for a number of reasons. At the time (about 3 months ago) it was about $17.00!!!! Now the Kindle version costs what I can get the hardcover for. This is ridiculous! What could have possibly happened in 3 months to nearly triple the Kindle version price?!? I am VERY disappointed.Needless to say, I am now NOT buying the Kindle version.By the way, the three stars is because I am giving Amazon 1 star for changing the price like this and I give the book itself 5 stars. That averages to 3."
5,Outstanding!,"This is an absolutely outstanding effort at recreating what life was like in Hastings, England for police officers trying to enforce the law during WWII. I wish there were 100 more episodes to purchase and enjoy!"
4,Foyle's War: Series 1-5--From Dunkirk to VE-Day,"Great period piece! Very well done on what must have been a limited budget. Cinematography, scenery, sets, costumes--all first rate. Good acting jobs by entire ensemble. Gives a great look at life in southeastern England during the war. The war is not the focus, but it is always there. Each 100-minute episode (disc) stands fairly well on its own. At the same time, the episodes flow smoothly from one to another. Recording rough in a very few spots."
5,"What a thoughtully written, well acted portrayal of a horrible time!","This is a wonderfully written, well portrayed story of war torn Britain. Though it doesn't get too heavily into the dark side of WWII it does an excellent job of what I imagine is the everyday happenings and a police detective pushing through the everyday problems, murders, theft etc.All the actors bring a rich depth to their characters. It was a well-planned out, richly researched piece and worth watching again and again!"
5,Personal experience,"As a 12 year-old I lived in Southhampton at this time. What I can remember watching these DVDs brought back memories.The accuracy of the scenes are incredible.Only one who experienced the conditions and fear of the future could truly comprehend,but this series is so well scripted you cannot help but be involved in a very close relationship with the British people at this time."
5,Great Series,"I have loved the Foyle's War series since it first aired on PBS and am now thrilled to have it as a DVD set. It is in the best tradition of British period drama/mystery. The acting is superb, and only rarely was I able to guess who the culprit was. I believe Michael Kitchen as Christopher Foyle is right up there with Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes."
4,war,Bought this for my brother-in-law and he really enjoys the episodes he has watched so far. I purchased the other 5 seasons as a Christmas present for him.
2,Mostly pretty dreadful,"Foyle is mostly foolish piffle. It is closer to Edith Blyton's Fabulous Five than to something like ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" or ""Inspector Morse."" Kitchen is pleasant enough to watch, but the more peripheral characters -- Sam, Milner, and especially Foyle's son -- are ludicrous. Mercifully they effectively killed off Andrew Foyle midstream. Foyle has one redeeming theme, though, which is that justice is one of the victims of war. It's a lesson lost on current-day Americans and Brits, however."
1,Don't buy if you are hard of hearing,"If you buy the DVDs one at a time,l-5 they are closed captioned. If you buy the set,none of them are.If you are hard of hearing it is a real rip off."
3,Lacking Closed Captions,"What a marvelous series! If only I could avoid the frustration of having to back it up to try to determine what was said. Why oh Why do these episodes get distributed without closed captions? I have nothing wrong with my hearing, but as one who prefers to hear each and every word being spoken, I never view an installment without experiencing frustration over not hearing every word, not seeing names spelled out, and being sure of colloquialisms with which I am not familiar."
5,wonderful,"What makes this series five star for us is: the heart warming story line, character development, detailed period setting and costuming, and truly terrific acting. Each of the 19 episodes grapples with the mystery to be solved. But there are also nuanced themes of decisions in time of war, ethics, and poignant moments revealing WWII from the Brit's perspective. We had to ration ourselves to one episode a week or we'd have gone through them within the week."
5,A Wonderful Series,I bought the series as a Christmas present for my friend last year and I was hooked after watching the first story with him! It's about life in a small town in England during WWII and the adventures of Detective Foyle. I have since given additional sets of the complete series or parts of it to friends and relatives who are history-oriented. Everyone who has seen this series has raved about how wonderful it is!
5,Foyles War,"This is a great series in the civilized, understated British tradition. Michael Kitchen is perfect, as is Sam, his young driver. If you like Jane Austen movies but read Agatha Christie under the covers, this is for you."
5,Foyle's War: Series 1-5,"Terrific series, and habit forming in that when one story ended we looked so forward to the next that we had to ration ourselves so as not to run out of DVDs too soon! Make sure to view the disks in the proper time sequence to watch the characters develop."
5,History plus mystery,"As a 69 year old history buff, I enjoyed learning a great deal more about what it must have been like to live in England in WWII. The producer put in a great deal of effort to get the people, setting, wardrobes, and vocabulary right. This was the best part for me. I enjoy entertainment that requires thinking and the dilemmas of wartime justice were fascinating: What do you do when the criminal is playing a major role in the war? The characters were believable and well acted although, probably due to the constraints of time and budget, Foyle seems to magically put all the clues together near the end to solve the mystery. I have watched these episodes at least 3 times in the past 3 years and enjoyed them every time.I expect to continue to enjoy them over the years. I have also given them as gifts to 4 people, all of whom were very positive."
5,First class historically linked detective series.,"This is a first class detective series, set against conditions on the south coast of Britain, starting during a critical phase of the second World War, the Battle of Britain. It is low key but engaging and very believable. Having lived through this period in Britain I can vouch for it's historical correctness. I was very glad to find this offered by Amazon at a very competitive price. I highly recommend this.Alan Mattock"
3,pathetic,"as a Real native american..im offended. i was actualy on amazon searching for books and became interested in brad steigers books. now im not so sure. it realy is nothing but ignorance right off the back with the word ""indian"" in it. indians are from india. i can say with the utmost certainty that the information in this book is not only distorted if not completly inacurate but is also dangerous. i have personal knowledge and experience with so many things going wrong for non-natives when dealing with our ways and medicine. when the medicine way is not passed on to you and you still attempt to use it..people can quite possibly even die. if you do indeed have an interest in the native american church or other ceremonies for help i would recomend asking a real medicine man. otherwise your wasting your time and money. P.S. this is more of a warning then a review."
3,okay,"basically what most of the other reviewers said. this calc prep book is too easy for the ap tests that are now being administered. there are quite a few typos which makes everything a little more confusing. the lessons are okay, but only if you want to review or clear up a fuzzy area. i dont think you can learn calc from this book. what's helpful though is that in the back there are these english-to-calculus translations that are great to memorize and help tremendously for the test. but other than that, look elsewhere for an outstanding calc book."
4,"Eh, it was okay...","I took AP Calc BC at our school (which is taught by a very qualified teacher), but I bought this book in case. It helped me with some of my fuzzy areas, but otherwise I felt it just wasn't up to par. There were a lot of typos in the book and the practice tests were too easy. I got a 5 nonetheless, but I would attribute that to my teacher and not the book."
4,Nice beginner drum dvd,"This is a good step by step beginning drum video. Harvey Sorgen walks you through some basics before ""letting you play with the band"". My only complaint is that although the first part is very fundamental, in a good way, when you get to the scene section of playing with the band, it's a quantum leap to be able to successfully do a dance groove or a country groove for 5 to 6 minutes without LOTS more practice back in the rudiments."
3,Wings of Joy,"Some good moments, but overall this album never really ""gets"" me...I'd recommend ""Loved"" for new Listeners."
2,"Shoots high, falls flat","Conveying a mystique that is not musically there, this Cocteau-Dead Can Dance lift only mimics a few hallowed principals, usually at the expense of much artistic integrity. The increasingly-grating, female-baby-like vocal deliveries only compliment these attempts at haunting melodic minimalism when the songwriting somehow stands up- which it usually does not. With some refinement, and perhaps a more informed musical vocabulary this could have been something special, as brief signs of darkened life shimmer beneath the plodding craftsmanship enough to appease fans of the genre."
5,crafts for dummies,This book allows you to 'get your feet wet' in crafting without having to spend a huge amount of money. It doesnt talk down to you or use a lot of jargon. All round I think its a pretty good beginners book.
5,Good review,"This book is concise and is easy to read due to its questions and answers format. It touches all major subjects in ID, although briefly.Not very useful for clinical medicine.It even has some historical facts about ID that I found very interesting."
4,I've got a question.....,"In as much as this book is out of print and I don't actually have it... I am looking for a book or series of books that give the actual weekly charts (Top 40) for all Country hits from 1944 to now. Does this book have it, and if not, where can I obtain this information? Please e-mail me with any information."
5,Excellent book,This is a first class research tool. This book is perfect for the music collector who wants to know what songs charted and when by any given artist. What is really great about this book is it covers songs from 1944 through 2005. It also has sections to rank the top singles and artists from Billboard publishing. This is not a fan club book. This is a factual report of actual recording success by artist.
4,Rip It Up!,"Jesse Johnson blows the roof off with some funky and mind blowing guitar throughout Every Shade Of Love! His leads are devastating. Of course the phat synth and thumpin' bass are right on time also. He really lets it fly on this one. Here is the song list: (*=my favorites)Side One: ""Love Struck""*/""So Misunderstood""*/""I'm The One""*/""Color Shock""Side Two: ""Every Shade Of Love""*/""Everybody Wants Somebody To Love""*/""I'm Just Wanting You""**/""Stop-Look-Listen""Jesse Johnson don't play..."
4,Real good Album,"I've always Dug Jesse Johnson.THe Man is Very Talented but so Underrated it ain't even right.Jesse Played&Rode the Wave of the Minneapolis Sound but folks who have truly followed His Career know that He was a Serious Guitar Player.He could Play the Synth Game&What not.but He really lets loose on some of the Jams Here.His Solos are still tight.I got this Album when it First came out back in 88.""Lovestruck""&the Title track were two of the songs I really dug on this Album.Live He really rips it up on the AXE!!this is a Really Good Album By a Very Talented Cat."
5,really really good for self-study,"It's straight forward and to the point. It explains a lot of theorems in an understandable way, without loss of mathematically consistency. By reading this book you can actually learn something without getting lost in bunch of 'high level' mathematics. For me, it's the Hamiltonian mechanics. I'm a mechanical engineer without systematic training in math and physics, so I failed couple of times when I was trying to understand the Hamiltonian mechanics by reading some more comprehensive books specialized on that topic. However, after reading this book for just about 20 pages, I finally got the idea and could pick up a pen and formulate my own problems in a systematic way."
1,"Nice cover, but ...","I may yet learn to appreciate Chekhov, but not from this volume; it's infinitesimal 8-point type makes reading an unbearable chore."
1,Unreadable edition,"The type in this paperback edition is so small that one needs a magnifying glass to decipher it. No publisher is named; all that is stated inside the back cover is ""Made in USA, San Bernardino, CA, 03 January 2013. I am throwing the book away as unreadable. A waste of money and a virtual scam."
5,Begin Here,"For any one discovering Chekhov for the first time, or anyone wanting to make a review of Chekhov's short stories, this edition is especially valuable. On the theory that one book leads to another, a valuable gloss to the text is the long story by Tillie Olsen, ""Tell Me A Riddle."""
1,8 Point Font = Almost impossible to read,"This review isn't about Chekhov or even this collection of his stories. It has everything to do with the hideous printing of this edition. I have never ever ever purchased a book that uses an 8-point font throughout, like this one does. Is like reading footnotes. The spacing and layout is also weird and this makes reading it a drudgery, rather than a pleasure, as it should be."
1,Shabby edition for a great writer,"Whoever cranked out this piece of junk knows nothing about typography, book design or good taste. The type is tiny, at eight points or so -- unreadable. Whoever made this also did not credit the translator. It feels as if someone got access to Lulu or some other printing on demand platform and decided to make some money in an underhanded way. I have had excellent experiences with Amazon overall. This edition is simply bad and insults the work of a great writer. Avoid it."
2,Attention publisher...,"In a book by one of the best writers ever and translated by two of the best translaters in the business, it is unforgiveable to us such a tiny (6pt) typeface. I'll not be able to read it, with either bifocals or magnifying glass."
5,perceptive and heartbreaking,"Chekhov simply astonishes. ""The Lady with the Little Dog,"" one of his most famous stories, is rendered splendidly by Pevar and Volokhonsky. I don't know of any other writer who captures the confusion, fear and excitement of romantic love as well as Chekhov does here. The last line is perfect."
4,Essential Short Story Reading,"The short story is a cross between poetry and prose. Its best writers possess the skills of both writing styles. Chekhov was such a writer. His short stories provide a revealing glimpse of pre-Bolshevik-Revolution Russia, which in many ways doesn't seem to have changed much: stark, gray, cold, dysfunctional. He was able to sculpt three-dimensional characters, scene-scapes, and storylines that cause emotional reaction in readers. To read Chekhov is to feel.While I found myself distracted by the Russian character names, the aging writing style, and my ambivalence toward short fiction, it's impossible to read these stories without great appreciation for the man's talent and his contribution to America's understanding of Russian culture and the world of literature in general. This collection is a good way to say, ""Yeah, I've read Chekhov."" --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."
2,Doesn't work,Didn't clean very well. Like that it was biodegradable but if it doesn't work who cares. Wish someone made a safe product that really does the job
1,Filmy,"Didn't work on our tile counters. The grout is still dirty. In fact, we had a lot of film substance after we tried to clean them.I had to scrub to get off the cleaner product because it made the tile even worse. I'll have to try something else."
5,Oh Yeah,It does what it says and has made my cleaning of the shower and floors much easier. I will buy again!
2,Unable to clean tough stains,"For light stains, you really don't need anything, just brush would do the work. I was hoping this product would make cleaning tough stains a little bit easier, but pretty ineffective, still have to brush hard over and over to get the tough stains off. So I don't know what this product is really useful for."
2,Thumbs down,Did not work well for the grout on my shower tile! Sprayed the tile and scrubbed but did not remove as expected.
1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL,"This product was VERY expensive. For the price that I paid, I expected it to work! Save your money! Clorox does a much better job than this stuff."
1,terrible,this product did nothing to remove grout stains...i followed the directions to a T and after several applications the grout was no cleaner than before i started...soap and water are 100 times more effective...what a waste of money
2,Don't bother,"I had high hopes for this product, due to the dual nature of cleaning and sealing. I used a grout brush and tried this product in few areas, spraying a scrubbing. It was literally as effective as using water.Vinegar works so much better, my advice would be to use vinegar and buy a good sealer after you're done cleaning the grout."
2,not a one step cleaner,Used on bathroom grout in the bathroom. Really did fine on some grout and not so good on badly stained grout. Will have to remove grout to get it the way that it should look. Think it would do fine if you scrubbed every year but it is not a product for me.
2,DID NOT WORK,"I purchased this based on the positive reviews. I used the Hoover grout cleaner prior to this which also didn't work. I had great hopes for this. It did the job better than the Hoover brand which did almost nothing. I tried everything; letting it soak in well; scrubbing with grout brush, etc. - nothing. I so wish it had. Had to buy grout paint and redo grouting but it now looks great."
2,Not usable for me,The book is lovely to look at. It has beautiful photographs and the recipes are easy to read. Unfortunately it uses ingredients I can not find in a 20 mile radius of my home and uses ingredients I am not able to eat.
3,A little disappointed,"I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and while I have followed a very healthy diet for the last few years, I'm always looking to find new healthy recipes, even more so now. For the most part the recipes are decent and the addition of which cancers each recipe benefits more is helpful. However I was very disappointed at the recipes that were included that have a good deal of suger in the ingredients since cancer feeds on suger and that should be eliminated from our diets. She doesn't even try to use healthy alternatives such as Stevia. I think she needs to do better before writing a book like this."
4,One Bite at a Time,"I got this cook book for my friend whose husband has cancer. They're very well-read on nutrition and how eating the right things benefits the person with cancer and after. These recipes are easy to medium to prepare. I also got to sample them myself, so I know the recipes taste very good. It's such a hard time when given the diagnosis, so such a fantastic cook book is a gem."
5,One Bite at a Time is wonderful,One Bite at a Time is the best cookbook yet I've seen that uses the current medically substantiated emphasis on vegetables to help the person fighting or preventing cancer to heal.Recipes contain no sugar or white flour and are full of fresh herbs and nutritional spices with gorgeous attractive color photos of the healthy foods easy to prepare and digest.
2,The pictures are nice,"As the book suggested, I showed it to my loved one who is fighting cancer so that he could pick out a few recipes to try. He looked at every thing and did not find one single thing that interested him.The recipes are too healthy! He needs ""bad"" foods like burgers, barbecue, ice cream and pie.Also, the ingredients are special. I wouldn't even know where to look for them in my grocery store."
5,A beautiful book,"This is an outstanding recipe book and it is beautiful to look at. It is good for anyone who wants to eat healthy and delicious food. I have made about 10 recipes already and they are great. Besides the recipes, the author teaches. I have already given it to others!"
2,Almost a good light,"The light is nice bright white light. Good beam. The problem that I have with this one is that is feels like they put the wrong shroud on it. It's the same size case as they put on the Pelican SabreLIte 2000 Flashlight. When I turn the light off all it takes is another half of a turn and the shroud pops off. You can even see the O-ring. As it sits I wouldn't see this being submersible at all.I did e-mail Pelican about this issue. They said, ""you shouldn't have to turn the shroud that far to turn the light off."" I'm going to send it back and see how well the replacement works. I'll update this review at that time."
3,somewhat good for the price,"This item is a good deal with the price.Pros:SmallLong battery lifePlug-and-Play, no need to setup anythingConsThe wheel button makes a VERY irritating noise when turnsStops working sometimes, then you need to push the small button underneath to reset"
5,"Little but ""Big""",This USB optical mouse is the cats meow. I don't like moving the curser with my finger and this little jewel really comes in handy. Just plug the reciever into the USB port and your good to go. When your done take it out and push it into the bottom of the mouse for storage. Saves the battery that way also. Smaller than normal but big on perfromance I like it big time ! :)
2,Eh...,"This mouse worked fine after I first got it, then just stopped working a few weeks later. About two months after that, after trying to find a solution to my problem through Microsoft's website, it just started working again. This mouse is good when it works, though it gets choppy sometimes when you move it or the computer- it has to resend the signal or something."
2,"works fine, but very long usb adapter","I got this mouse for my mother to use on her laptop. She likes pink, and I've always had good luck with Microsoft mice, so I thought this would be a good one.The mouse works fine, but the adapter is way too long for a laptop. It sticks out 3-4 inches, which is a real letdown. Was hoping it had one of the modern 1/2"" adapters like you see on the Logitech mice. If not for the adapter I'd give it five stars."
2,Lasted Six Months,"I loved this mouse for six months. Worked great, easy to connect, battery lasted about two months.Then yesterday it died. The scroll wheel stopped scrolling. It feels like it's stripped. It has a three year warranty, but for the cost of shipping, and the hassle,and the fact that I only paid twelve bucks, I just bought a new one. Found a Logitech at Best Buy for twenty five bucks, seems a little sturdier.This was not a good buy. I gave it two stars because it is what it is. A cheap little mouse good for about six months."
4,Newer version,I had an earlier version of this mouse which worked well but finally quit on me after several years of use. This version is essentially the same mouse with a few updates and is well worth the price for its ease of use and how long it lasts. I use rechargeable AA batteries that in this mouse last quite awhile. Would defiantly recommend it for price conscious people.
1,blinks and skips while trying to connect to usb,Very frustrating. If you let this mouse it for any length of time it takes several seconds to reconnect to the USB receiver. Very frustrating! HA! doing it while I write! USB blinks green and cursor starts and stops on screen.
4,Nice Product,This is a great mouse the only thing lacking is an on off switchI use it on both my desktop and laptop but I like to leave the usb connected when I use the desktop so I wedge a pice of plastic in the mouse to turn it off and save the battery
4,May be small for larger hands,"I am a over 6' tall and have larger hands - my hand curls over the top of the mouse in such a manner that I guide the mouse strictly with my fingers - my palm and lower hand does not contact the mouse at all while it is on a flat surface. This contributes to a slight hand fatigue after an hour of use.The mouse appears to be well built and it seems like it will last a while if it's not abused. It would be rather easy to break the USB receiver if it's jacked into a laptop as it sticks straight out. I have not had pointer problems, like skipping, as others have reported. The current picture listed (as of 7/27/06) does not reflect what you will be shipped - the USB signal receiver resembles a thumb drive not the curved profile that is displayed.Update June 2007 - sure enough I accidently broke the protruding, USB receiver! Now I got a black paperweight. Beware the protruding, Pinnochio's-nose lookin' receiver!"
4,"Terrific traveler, long battery","This is a terrific mouse if you want something tiny to stick in your travel bag, just in case. I say ""just in case"" because after a few days of solid use on a biz trip, my hand got a bit cramped because of the small form factor.But if you just need something for minimal use, this is a great mouse. I've had the same batteries in there for nearly a year now and it's still going strong.The range is pretty short for the wireless connection, but I've never had an issue with it (after all, how far do you need to be to do your mousing??)"
5,Excellent product,This is the second of this model mouse that I have bought. I use it for my laptop and desktop. I use Photoshop and this works just fine for the accuracy I need. Fits the hand perfect.
1,Go elsewhere,I have 3 computers. I owned this mouse for about 6 months. Just stopped working one day. This is the second mouse from Microsoft that I have had over the years. Neither one of them was durable enough to make it to the one year mark.I own similar Logitech mouse products for two computers and a Dell that came with my other computer.I have not had good experiences with Microsoft hardware.
4,Works great,"A very nice mouse. I personlly use it for travel only.Nice 2 button (3 if you click the wheel) mouse. The wheel is nice and rugged with ""grips"". The mouse itself is ergonomically comfortable for both right and left handed use.Two things I would like to see improved for a 5 star rating1) Auto shut off. The mouse will stay on unless you put the usb key back into the bottom of the mouse. Walk away from the computer and the mouse stays on killing the battery.2) Smaller usb key. When I bought this I was also looking at some logitech mice that had a usb key so small, you could literally leave it in your laptops usb port and would not have to worry about damage. But you have to pay a great deal for that kind of usb key.So good all around mouse i have used for 6 months now."
3,"Okay at first, but then it fizzled out...","This was my first wireless mouse, and I enjoyed the convenience of going wireless. I have had this mouse for about a year and a half, and after a while, it seemed that it would not respond. The pointer would move when I would move the mouse, but clicking would have no effect. I would have to click many times to wait for the mouse to respond. This has been happening more frequently within the last six months. I have changed the battery a couple of times, and even did so recently but that did not improve performance. Today I received theMicrosoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 ( D1T-00002 )to replace it and put the wireless mouse away. I give it three stars because it is comfortable, compact, ergonomic, and was fun at first. But I had to move on. It was too frustrating."
3,Stay With Logitech,"This mouse (I purchased 3 of) is likely the worst I've ever bought/used…In short, Mediocre at best--but let me qualify this point…Useable distance: Three-feet (arms length) away approximately…Beyond that, forget it…Logitech rules in this Dept.Quality Build: Good or BetterBattery Life: Excellent—lasts longer than equiv Logitech’s by nature of its built-in idle-off function…Worst Part: Its full size IR dongle….Aproximately 2.5” long will break/fry your laptop USB port if not careful...Since this experience, sometime 6 years ago, I’ve used Logitech exclusively…Their IR distance is much greater, plus have mini IR dongles, as do MS mouse’s today, yet I’ll not go back...Don’t waste your money."
5,Great little mouse.,"This is a perfect mouse for laptop users. It's a bit smaller than your average mouse, but works just as well.Battery life is excellent; months/ year+.I really have no negatives about this mouse. Just an FYI: there is a little button both inside the mouse, and on the USB connector piece. We had actually put the mouse away for months, thinking it was broken. But it was just a matter of hitting the little button on the USB piece, which restored connectivity. Definitely a DOH moment."
3,Stopped working,I got it pink to match my pink laptop. Stopped working within a year but was great before it broke. I changed the battery but nothing :-(
3,Mouse,"I really like this mouse, but the end that goes in the usb port is really big. Also the only way to shut off the mouse is to remove the oversized adapter into the mouse. It works great other than that."
2,scroll wheel,"It's small and cute and just the right size for my hand - I'm an Asian female so this may feel small if you have big hands. The reason for my dissatisfaction is because of the noise it makes when i roll the scroll wheel. I've used many computer mice, but this is by far the worst one."
3,mediocre product,"It works okay. I bought 3 for my company, 1 became defective in the first 3 weeks. The other 2 still work, but not flawlessly. I just bought a logitech LX7 to replace the broken one. It's significantly more responsive."
1,Bad Design. Look for some other mice,I bought this product in January 2006. It worked great untill the USB dongle stopped working apparently for no reason. I didnt dropped it or did anything that could have broke the USB dongle. This is my second bad experience with Microsoft Hardware. I will stay away from Microsoft's hardwares hereafter.
3,Convenient Inconvenience,"The mouse works great as expected and is super sensitive. This is my first wireless mouse and I purchased it for the convenience of not being restricted by a wire. However, the fact that the transmitter has to be disconnected from the USB port and placed in the bottom of the mouse to shut the power off and save battery power is very inconvenient. It doesn't make any sense that the mouse was not equiped with an Off/On button so that the transmitter could be left plugged in. There is a tiny button in the recess where the transmitter is placed to turn off the power. It would have been much more convenient to have just a small On/Off button instead, so the transmitter could be left plugged in."
1,Awful Experience,This Microsoft mouse stopped working after 4 weeks. The wireless connection would drop off. The rubber sides have started to wear off. I had the Logitech Cordless Notebook mouse for 12 months and it still works great. I am going back to Logitech.
4,I like it. No big qualms with this product.,"I've owned it for about a week and it has worked right out of the box on my Windows XP Dell 700m without any driver installation. It works perfectly with the receiver within a few feet and line-of-sight, but of course with some interference, the signal becomes intermittent. I cannot comment of battery life, but it shouldn't be a problem with some 2200maH NiMH batteries. (btw, it comes with a single Energizer AA). I like the fact that the scroll wheel now clicks like the Logitech mice. I believe the older Microsoft mice just had a smooth wheel. I would like to have a couple additional buttons by the thumb for going back and forward in browsers, but I knew that going in on the purchase so I cannot complain too much. The mouse is small and comfortable, but I'd like it to be a little more thin so I can stow it awhile easier. Also, it would have been nice with a carrying bag. But, at the end of the day, I think it is a great product."
4,Good product,"I'm a real fan of this mouse. I used to own a computer repair company in the Knoxville area of Tennessee. I sold these mice to almost every customer that baught a laptop from us. I don't think I ever recieved a single complaint from any of them. The mouse is small and compact without being too small to use. The slot in the bottom that holds the adapter is great. It turns off the mouse when you plug the adapter into it so it saves a considerable amount of battery life when not in use. With an average of an hour a day use, you can plan on between 4 and 6 months life from a single set of batteries. You can't go wrong with this product.The 4 star rating is only because its a Microsoft product and I'm a linux developer. I just can't make myself give 4 stars to a company that so grossly over charges for an operating system with so many flaws."
1,Cheap Hunk of Junk,"This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made. It felt very light and flimsy, the definition of cheap plastic. Not just the construction but the performance was terrible. It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes. This was very very frustrating. Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again.I wish I could give this device a worse rating, somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate."
1,Don't do it!,"As first use, the mouse seems great. But soon you will see that it makes the cursor on any word processing program jump around, especially email (Outlook Express). This causes typos that you don't know about until you spell check. the spell checker can't catch them all, especially syntax errors. Google the product and you'll see the same complaints. Might not sound like much but you will end up flushing it just to get this evil product out of your sight."
4,I LOVE this Mouse -- even on my Macs!,"I bought this mouse to try out with my new Dell laptop because I really hate the two-button touchpads on laptops. I'm very happy with it. Nice comfortable grip, great positioning of buttons and wheels. The only thing I don't like about it is that silly USB receiver that needs to be inserted in the computer to use it; why not take advantage of the computer's BlueTooth technology like Apple's wireless mouse models do? In any case, it works great with my PC and my Mac laptop. Highly recommended."
2,Logitech is better than this,"Didn't like it. It's difficult to set up and use. Not sensitive to movements. Battery was dead in 2 months. It's not rubust at all. Finally, I bought Logitech mouse which is cheaper ($20) and better quality."
1,avoid,I have been using this mouse for maybe a month and the scroll wheel just stopped working. Am going to try to return it and will get another brand. Very poorly made.
3,Decent,"This mouse is small and compact but eats batteries and is a little laggy. However, it gets the job done and seems durable as it has been dropped a few times and still works the same. If it's under 15 bucks, I'd recommend."
5,Nice Product,Bought this product to use with a laptop.. very nice. Just plugged in the USB transmitter and it instantly worked. Love the feel of the mouse and it travels well. Happy that I was able to get it in Pink.
4,Great mouse,"I have 4 of this wireless mouses for my computers, one of them I used it for over 3 years and still working, so decided to buy again for others. I don't have any problem with it, just plug it to the USB port, no software needed, not only for PC computer, it is also for Mac computer. Just 1 AA battery and use it for a long long time. The size of the USB receiver is the same size as other USB flash drive, if it becomes shorter, it works much better for me, but it is not a big deal."
1,Worked for less than a month,"Got this item quickly and for a good price. I guess I should have known to not buy the cheapest one, as it worked for less than a month. One day I just plugged it in and it wouldn't connect. Changed the batteries, reset it, and nothing. Total waste of money."
5,good,"I have uesed this mouse one months more,very good and easy use. thanks. next need something I will back here again."
3,Not so much,"This is not very good for notebooks or laptops. The receiver is too large even for a desktop because it sticks out too far from the USB plug. It goes through batteries like crazy. Also this unit is quite picky as to what type of surface it is used on and skips all around if not on a good pad. I went to a different brand with a receiver 5 times smaller and a lazer beam, it is much better in all respects. Look around before you buy."
3,good product for price,"I bought this product for two reasons. It's a Microsoft mouse and it was cheap. In retrospect, I might have paid a litte more if I knew how big the USB receiver for this mouse was. But for the price of thirteen bucks, I guess its not too bad."
3,This mouse is great...for a while.,"This mouse has been a great little addition to my system. It was easy to set up, and I've had no problem with the size of the product. My issue is with the fact that after only 2 weeks of usage, the battery seems to be going dead already. I can only assume it's the battery since the mouse seemed to work perfectly fine when I first purchased it, but it now consistently doesn't recognize clicks or scrolling of the wheel. For what would've otherwise been a glowing review, I'm severely disappointed in the performance of the product after such a short period of time. Take it for what it's worth."
5,Wireless mouse,I ordered this mouse to replace one that quit working. It is working great and doing what I need it to do. It shipped within a couple days.
1,Stopped working - on/off switch problem,"I have had this mouse for 2 years. From the start it has been reluctant to switch on. This won't bother you if a desktop user, but having a laptop, it has finally become intolerable for me. The on/off switch is located under the mouse; when transporting the laptop, you remove the USB dongle and slot it under the mouse for storage; this switches the mouse off. Unfortunately, when you remove the USB dongle from the mouse (placing the dongle into your laptop port) the mouse remains off. I have tried remedies such as replacing battery, warming the battery with body heat, warming the mouse, flicking the on/off switch. All work with varying degrees of success. This weekend has been the last straw as it has taken me 3 days of jiggling, till finally it came back to life."
5,Good mouse,Good mouse. Good value because it's discontinued model I think. Just plu in and it's ready. Easier than using your finger on the laptop.
3,good but has some flaws,"This mouse works well for the most part, but sometimes the laser gets confused on some shiny surfaces. Other times the mouse and receiver seem unable to communicate for a few seconds only to return to normal a few seconds later. Somewhat annoying.It would be nice if the mouse had a small shutoff button. The mouse does shut off when the receiver is inserted into its slot but sometimes I want to shut off the mouse without removing the receiver.It would also be nice if the receiver slot was the same thickness of the receiver. Or maybe the receiver slid into the bottom or something. Currently the receiver is a bit thicker and the result is that the mouse is bulkier than it needs to be.Otherwise the mouse is pretty good."
4,Practical for a portable mouse.,"I bought this mouse for my boyfriend's Dell laptop with Vista. It works great. Many laptop mice are too small for him to work with, but this one is large enough, without being as bulky as a regular desktop mouse. The optical sensor works great, he can even use it on top of his bed with the comforter! Only flaw we could find is that the middle scrolling wheel scrolls down the page way too quickly. I'm now trying to find a way to change the sensitivity."
4,great mouse!,"This mouse is great, small, portable very responsive has decent range and runs on a single AA battery. Being able to tuck the receiver at the bottom of the mouse is a nice touch. It would have been better if they included a battery indicator somewhere in the mouse"
5,Desktop or Laptop!,"I had bought one for myself when my mouse bit the dust, and then 2 more for my daughters at Christmas for their laptops! They work great and have such fun colors to pick from. I am thinking of getting another one for laptop!!"
2,"poor choice, but cute","I'm disappointed with this wireless mouse. It runs fine for about a month, that freezes up, which is not cleared up by rebooting or changing batteries. So very unreliable. I do enjoy when its working."
5,"best notebook mouse, period!","I need a small and portable notebook mouse for my newly acquired notebook computer. I am not good with touch-pads. So I did research and tested around and here is what I found:1. Wired mini-mouse are okey. But its demand for mouse pad and wire gets in the way.2. wired mini optical mouse are good. But again, wire limits me.3. wireless mini optical mouse is the best fit. But unlike its desktop cousins, a good one is hard to find. There is matter of design, egonomic, battery, power conservation, and connectivity. I tried many brands, most are okey, but none impressed me until I got this.It is small, yet egonomically well designed so that it feels good in my hands. Very comfortable. It only requires one battery, and conserves power well. Its receiver can be mated to the mouse to shut it down and for ease of carry. It simply works just by plugging in, no fuss.Overall, I am very happy with it."
1,POS Mouse,"Typical Microsoft product, worked for about a month and then started acting up. I replaced the battery, same thing,reset the connection, nothing, tried different usb ports, same....finally just threw it against the wall I was so frustrated. Do not buy this mouse unless you like throwing your money away and frustration! A much better small wireless mouse is LogiTech, have one for two years now and not any problems, all for just a few dollars more. You get what you pay for, and saving a couple of extra dollars isn't worth the frustration!"
3,"Good, but finicky","It is small, battery seems to last well, but exhibits one problem that I've not had with any other wireless mouse. The receiver dongle has limited range, and is easily blocked with just a couple sheets of paper. It took me a long time to figure this out (some of us are slower than others). I thought the problem was at the mouse end, diddled with different surfaces, but nothing seemed to help.Finally I put the Microsoft 3000 dongle on an extension (Logitech made it), set that on top of my BPS, and lo and behold the mouse works. It is a measured 24"" from the surface my mouse runs around on, and sticks out beyond the pile of draft paperwork that sits on my desk between the screen and the keyboard.My GUESS is that the transmitter in the mouse is less powerful than others ... which may be the reason Microsoft can claim long life for the battery.Hey, it works fine within its limitations, and its cheap. Can't beat that. Guess I'll keep it after all."
4,Great Little Mouse,"I just got this little mouse for my laptop, because it's compact and wireless. The mouse runs on a single AA battery, and should last for a while. I run my mouse in a Linux envoirment, and everything works right out of the box.My only complaint is the RF mouse does lag - compared to my Logitech dual optical. But compared to other wireless mice, it's very responsive. Though don't expect to do a lot of photo editing or gaming."
4,MICROSOFT WIRELESS NOTEBOOK OPTICAL MOUSE 3000,"THIS WAS MY FIRST WIRELESS NOTEBOOK MOUSE BUT I THOUGHT THE USB WAS A LITTLE TO BIG BUT I LIKE IT AFFORDABLE, SMALL NEED TO HAVE A CHARGER INSTEAD OF BATTERIES BUT STILL A GREAT BUY."
1,unsatisfied!,"The product is fine, the way it was shipped was horrible! I bought this as a Chrsitmas gift and it did not come in a box like how you would find it in the store. It was embarresting to give this to someone how it was shipped."
1,"Mouse defective, Microsoft support worse","I purchased two of these mice. One worked as expected, with full functionality. The other didn't. On the defective mouse, the scroll wheel worked, the right button worked intermittently, but the pointer wouldn't move. The defective mouse didn't work (same behavior) on two different computers (one XP and the other Windows 7). The ""working"" mouse was functional on both computers.When I contacted Microsoft, I learned that the ""product id"" was ""expired"" and that it would cost me $35 to even speak with support.I'm going to purchase a non-Microsoft mouse."
2,Won't last,"I have owned two of these models, both of which failed after 3-6 months of use. They worked well when functional, but I see no reason why a device like this should fail so quickly. I did not waste my time complaining to Microsoft, after the second time I switched to Logitech and have not had a problem."
2,"good, but will only last 1-2 years","I have gone throught 2 of these and both lasted about two years and I only use them when I carry around my laptop, as I have a docking station at my desk. The only reason I got a second one is because that is what work supplied. For home I bought a Logitech at 2/3 the price, and it works better, and has been more reliable. Go with the Logitech instead."
2,Good while it lasted,"It appears this mouse has a lifespan of no more than 6 months. While it functioned excellent at the beginning, over the last couple of months I've noticed that it started to react slowly as I used it, like the battery power was low (even with a fresh battery). After just under 6 months, the right-click has completely stopped functioning. You'd think the left click would wear out faster than the right click since I use that constantly, but the right-click has completely failed to even 'click', let alone function. Not sure the cost of returning it to Microsoft would warrant repair or replacement, I'll just buy a new one - only this time I'll follow the lead of others and go with Logitech since they do seem to be built 'sturdier'. Too bad - this mouse seemed to be the perfect choice to use with my laptop."
4,Great buy,"I had no problems with the mouse for the four years I have been using it. After a system update I needed to do on my mac before installation, the mouse was easily recognized by the laptop. I wish it was a bit longer for my long hands."
3,"comfortable, but reception doesn't last","I've owned this wireless mouse for 3 years now, and it worked wonderfully for the first year and a half. This is a good wireless mouse for your notebook. It is small and easy to stuff into a pocket. I like the feel of this mouse; it fits snug in my hand, and doesn't feel cheaply made. The battery life is about 1-2 months if used daily. The scroll, I think, is the best part of this mouse. The quality of the scroll is good, and coherent with your actions. The reason i'm giving this a 3 stars is because the signal of the mouse got much worse over time. I was be able to use this 10 feet away without a problem when it was new, but after a while, it became choppy and would disconnect even if I were a few inches away. All in all, this is a good, cheap wireless mouse that is acceptable while it lasts."
5,The mouse that roared,I ordered the Microsoft wireless notebook optical mouse 3000 for my laptop since I was having difficulties using the pointer pad. I have to say that was a great idea this mouse works so well and really like the action. I am so pleased with my purchase that I urge anyone needing a mouse for their computer to get this plug and play gem!
4,Good Buy,"Great little mouse. Compact and easy to use. Died after almost 2 years of use, but am buying another one."
2,Needs Redesign,Mouse does not glide smoothly on some surfaces due to the large depression on the bottom of the mouse designed to hold antenna.Mine would not glide smooth on rubber mousepad or plastic nor my corrian counter top. The idea is good however because when you insert the antenna the mouse turns off. This being said it may deserve 5 stars if the correct surface is used.
1,Get what you pay for... almost,"Lasted almost a week... USB connection failure, you can spend a few extra bucks or throw the dice with this MS reject. Maybe you will have better luck than I did. Microsoft brand name continues to loose value with me."
1,It just DIED on me.,"I was loving this mouse -until one day, it just died on me. It stopped working altogether. I moved it around to 3 computers, changed batteries, reconnected several times, rebooted machines needless to say, and became very disheartened. I threw it away and am not buying this ridiculous mouse anymore!"
2,Looked good but...,Looked good but only worked for 1 day! Replaced batteries and that didn't help. Had to return.
2,Not so good,This mouse disappoints me. It feels cheap and not very comfortable in my hand. The tracking motion also doesn't feel very good for some reasons. Signal lost sometime. I end up using my old mouse now.
2,Was good for some time,"The mouse was working fine in the beginning and then started acting up. I thought it was the battery, it wasn't. It seems that the mouse looses the connection and the cursor wouldn't move."
3,"Good, I guess","I only bought this because using my touch pad was giving me cramps in my right hand. Overall this mouse is ok. It doesn't have a standard on/off switch though, it has a kill switch that activates when you remove the USB antenna from its slot, and turns it off when you put it back, so you have to always remember to put the USB back in its slot when your done, and thats a bit of a bummer if you don't travel alot. Plus it's not as battery efficient as it likes to boast about on the blister pack. The mouse still has a pretty good range, and it does work, so i'm overall ok with this purchase. Although I would advise to cough up a few more bucks for a higher end Microsoft mouse or other brand, as the switch issue is a bit of a pain."
2,My update,"I haven't even owned this for a year now and it's already getting glitchy, the cursor wanders when I'm trying to keep it in one spot. Sometimes it doesn't work at all, and it's a good thing I invested in Eneloop rechargeable batteries because this goes through batteries in no time at all. I really hate that newer computer designs don't offer a direct connection to a wired mouse. I'd happily return to that than deal with a wireless mouse that I can't count on to last a year!"
3,A typical mouse,"The Microsoft mouse is very standard in all but color. It's feel in the hand, ease of movement and set up are all within the typical range. For the price, it has been a great mouse."
1,Very bad purchase,"Poor product. It did stop working after 7 months of use.Piece of advice: don't buy it. It has three years warranty but there is a catch, You pay Microsoft $35 to access their customer support."
4,Up to it's reputation,Microsoft usually makes good products and this is no different. My computer recognized it right away and I'm using it now.
4,Microsoft wireless mouse,This mouse feels good in the hand and works very well with my windows laptop. Setup was as easy as plugging the dongle into the USB port and starting to use it. Battery life is excellant even when you don't turn it off. I would recommend this product to anyone.The price I paid was an excellant bargin compared to other wireless mice.
3,Better Mouses out there,Functionally the mouse is fine. Size of the mouse is fine too. So why 3 out of 5 stars? The reason is that the antennae that you stick into the USB port is big! Around 2 inches it sticks out. I've seen other wireless mouses with the USB antennae just 1/2 inch.So you have to be careful not to accidentally bend the mouse antenna and possibly damage the USB port itself.
3,Worked great until......,"Had 2 of these, the 1st died within 2 wks and the current mouse about a year now and all worked fine until today. I was working and the USB receiver could not be found and message prompted to replace item! Didnt know it was a common issue with this mouse. Cant complain it was only $20 something at best buy, I will try the high end logitech Performance. maybe we get what we pay for? :)"
4,Good Mouse,This is a great mouse overall...perfect for laptop use. The only reasons that I did not rate it 5 stars was I was hoping there would possibly be some side navagation buttons and a little better connectivity range.Overall a great optical mouse for on the go users
5,Very Nice,"The mouse is small but, not too small. It fits perfect in my hand and is very portable. This was a great choice."
4,"Best one yet, but not much competition","In elapsed time of use, this one has outlasted the 3 previous models put together. For some reason, I've never gotten more than about 5 weeks out of one, but this one's going on 4 months now. I didn't go 5 stars because it's just doing what it's supposed to do. Nevertheless, it's the best one I've had."
1,Not happy with this product,"Got it to use it with my laptop. The USB port is on the left hand side, and I'm a right-handed person, but once I place the mouse to the right of my laptop (right next to it), it doesn't get any signal, and doesn't perform as a mouse should. So it turned to be pretty much useless for me. Do not recommend it for the right-handed people with left-sided USB ports."
3,"Not bad, but scroll wheel is noisy & cheap.","I just received this mouse and it seems to be pretty decent, but there is a problem with the scroll wheel. Every time I scroll up it makes a loud clicking noise and feels kind of cheap. Scrolling down seems to be fine. Tracking accuracy is acceptable, but not great. This will work fine if you use it occasionally to carry to meetings, but I wouldn't recommend using it as a primary mouse and I definitely would not recommend using it for gaming or graphics applications."
3,Hit or miss,"I've had this mouse for a month. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Mostly it doesn't. It generally has a slow response time, and sometimes just doesn't respond at all. It requires frequent repositioning to get just the right spot for the optical sensors. It seemed like a handy thing to have with a laptop, but I waste so much time trying to get it to work that it's pointless."
2,Dissapointed,Problem with this mouse is that very often it doesn't work properly. The mouse doesn't work if it is more than a couple of inches away from the computer and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Very disappointed.I'm returning it and buying something better than this poorly made mouse.
4,Good one!,"We liked this item. Its very useful. Only thing is its range is just 1 meter and not much. But as price is concerned, its reasonable choice."
1,low quality,"This is not a mouse that you expect as the best-seller. All you want from a mouse is that it registers your moves and your clicks. As a surprise, it does not! Sometimes I have to click several times to make it function. This happens even when the mouse is 1 foot away from the dongle. Reception is very poor. Maybe the 2.4GHz ones are better. If you do not use mouse pad, then you are in trouble. I didnt have problem with my old hp optical mouse on carpet (maybe again this is due to poor reception). I am disappointed with this product and try to replace it with a corded mouse."
2,works ok....for a short while,"I have owned two of these now. Each works fine for about a month and then something happens with the usb receiver that causes it not to work properly. Its like something happens that makes it unable to connect after youve taken it in and out of a usb slot for a month. Then what happens is you have to constantly jiggle the receiver to get it to connect properly. After a while its not worth the trouble. So if you dont mind investing $30 every 2 months for this mouse, then go ahead and purchase.. I dont know if other mice are the same way, but I will consider a return to mice with wires if they are."
3,Good for the money (bit I spent $10),"This was a replacement to a horrible piece of technology, a Logitech mouse. I have to say, though I have a couple problems with it, I'm pretty much satisfied.Setting up and storage is a breeze. I wish I could turn the mouse off, though, since I have it plugged into my desktop when I'm not out and about. The USB connector, if it jiggles in the USB port, will start flipping out and the mouse will only work about 50% of the duration of each second.And, lastly, its range is very limited.So in other words, it's not the worst of mice, but it's not the best either. I recommend continuing to shop for a mouse until you find a good, rechargeable, longer-range one for $30 or $40. Yes, it will cost more, but a mouse is the kind of thing you should never have to think about, it should always just BE there. And that is the failing of this mouse."
5,Great mouse... better than touchpad,I am so glad I bought this mouse. I read the other reviews and am following their advise to make sure I discount the mouse when I am not using it to save the battery life. I am always able to connect and disconnect with no problems. This is so much better than the touchpad on the laptop. I recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a nice travel mouse for their laptop.
2,Broken after 2 years,"My mouse stops work after 2 years with no reason. I'm not a gamer and use it so everyday but lightly.However, just last week, I plugged it in my laptop as usual. The light on the receiver has never come back so I think it's the battery. I replaced the battery and it still doesn't help. So I think it's either the loose contact on the stupid designed L-shape receiver or the USB interface that has broken..so disappointing.My other optical mouse, the cheap Logitech wired mouse (300 Baht=US$10) one still works fine after hard uses for several years !! Next time I'd better buy cheap mouse to avoid disappointment, not Microsoft one. The money I paid is not worth the usage, even."
4,Good ..not great...,Takes a while for the reciever to latch on to the signal after you press the Connect button... till then the mouse pointer will move frame by frame... takes about 15 to 25 secs. Pointer does skip at times... other than that its a good buy...
2,move on,"My second wireless mouse puchase from microsoft.And my last. Behaves and functions well as promised,on both my ancient dell battleship and new macbook but beware, the fit and finish is barely adaquate to any kind of physical adversity. Unit is as delicate as an eggshell.After it emerges from its plastic blister shell, you are on your own- there is no way to protect it from any kind of travel environment it was designed to function in.My advice is to keep looking for something else!"
1,Do not buy this - it will plain quit working and there is NO support,"I purchased this mouse two years ago and, now, inexplicably, it just won't ""turn on"" (there's no power button). Fresh batteries, resynching - all achieve the same result. And MS has zero assistance available on the matter. You're buying a paperweight if, like me, you're dumb enough to purchase this piece of garbage."
2,Battery Killer,"Everything I wanted in a portable mouse, on paper, but it remains powered up when the dongle is stowed, and kills batteries in short order. If I manually press the switch in the storage slot firmly, the optical sensor blinks, and if I press very hard, it goes out (i.e. power off). But the dongle does not even press hard enough on the switch to make the laser blink.Unfortunately, I bought it on a road trip so I couldn't return it to the store, and I didn't want to deal with trying to get warranty service. Life's too short."
2,Mouse,"I received this mouse beginning of December, 2011 and have used it since then, but today (February 22, 2012) it quit working. It is not the batteries. Also, I disabled it overnight by inserting the USB thing into the back of the mouse. I am disappointed as I'd hoped to get at least two year's worth of use for my money.I have a laptop but extremely dislike using my finger to navigate my laptop."
2,So far so good.,"The mouse works great and I like microsoft products, but would feel better about this purchase if Billy (Gates) and the boys would have their products made here in the United States by legal American citizens instead of using China's slave labor force to further pad their pockets with cash. At what point is too rich too much?But I bought the thing so who is the idiot?So I gave it a 2 star rating as a shame on you jab to Microsoft."
4,"So far, so good.","A solid mouse for a decent price. It is a little sensitive to surface textures for usability, otherwise no complaints."
2,Dead After 2 Months,"Mouse worked great at first, although I agree with the negative reviews on the short range and large USB insert. Received this in May, dead at the end of July - a few weeks after the return deadline. Very disappointing."
2,Mouse is great till usb jack broke.,"The mouse worked perfectly, the wheel button also works perfectly, unlike the buttons on my replacement notebook optical laser mouse 6000. I left the usb dongle plugged in, and put the laptop in its case and it stopped working. It started to say usb device not recognized. The new laser mouse 6000 has a different usb dongle that is one piece instead of 2.This mouse also has a better wheel button (good for middle clicking) than the newer laser mouse 6000 which is erratic.The wheel scrolling, and mouse positioning on the newer laser mouse 6000 is better than this mouse."
1,Bad Design,"The reciever sticks out of notebook. If yo uhave your USB slot on back face, that will break the reciever when you tilt the notebook. Mine just stopped working after 2 months. Bad choice"
2,Misleading: not bluetooth,"This mouse popped up when I did an amazon search for ""bluetooth mouse"" However when it arrived I couldn't get it to work with my computer's internal bluetooth module.When I re-did the search on Amazon, I noticed in tiny print that the results were ""sponsored links"" and not the actual results. Very lame!The whole point was that I didn't want a dongle sticking out of my computer.If you think this is a bluetooth device, you are mistaken. Amazon shouldn't allow non-bluetooth devices to pop up in bluetooth searches."
3,how far is the mouse's operation range,"Hi friendI just want to buy this stuff and wondering what the working range is, 6ft or 20ft? thanks"
1,no left handed support,I am left handed this mouse is not. It is useless. Would have been nice if seller had told me before I bought. Buyer beware.
4,Good but little small for my hands,"The product is good, plugins to my vista and xp laptops seamlessly. I have been using it for the last two months almost 3 hours daily, battery seems to be still going strong.I just wish it was a little bigger, I have a normal male palm size :)"
2,Disappointing,"It worked for the first 10 months I owned it, with only minor problems. Now, the mouse sometimes works, other times just stops randomly even though all the lights are on, new battery, and pressing the connect button.The USB part of the mouse, sticks out a little farther then I would like, because I seemed to bang into it often, which would then disrupt connectivity. And sometimes without even touching the USB part, it would have problems connecting.Spend the extra 15 dollars and get a better mouse than this one."
5,Pink Mouse,"I received this product a couple days after ordering it! Also, the mouse came packaged and exactly as described, it is a very cute shade of pink."
2,Great at first but then...,"The mouse worked really well for the first couple of weeks, but then it started freezing up. The connect buttons don't really change anything. Now it works for a few minutes when you first plug it in but then freezes again."
2,Un expected product,"While purchasing this product, i thought that it has a micro receiver and nothing was mentioned about this in the description, but what was given to me was the other receiver which is as big as a flash drive."
4,windows 7 x64bit compatible mouse,Setup in Win 7 was quick. I have large hands so the mouse is small. I have never experienced any type of lag like others have reported. the middle scrolling isn't quiet. In fact the only con that I have is the scrolling wheel broke after only owning this mouse for 2 months. Which sucks for me since I love using the scroll wheel for browsing pages. The rest of the mouse still functions. I'd recommend this mouse since its cheap and works for Win 7 64bit.
3,Mouse,"It's a fair mouse, not too fast and not too slow. The usb receptor is a little bit too long but works fine. I don't think that the color is aloe green as they presented on amazon and other web sites, or at list not that light green. It is actually a darker green. If you're not pretentious, than this mouse might suit you."
4,Microsoft Wireless Mouse 3000,"I spoke to others who have this mouse and they said that the battery (1) lasts over 9 months. That is good!The only problem I have with it is the left button clicks 2 times once in a while. I have not been stuck with the 2 clicks yet, so it is not a problem."
4,Very Good,"The mouse was really good, it was new and reallly pretty but i asked for a black mouse because my computer is black and i got a grey one instead"
2,Worked fine for two months,I bought this mouse in June. It worked fine for two months and then it started to act up. My computer guys say it's time for a new one. Very disappointing!
2,Not so great!,"It disconnects alot. I have a new HP laptop and the usb stick blinks alot searching for a signal. I put in new batteries and it still does it. Also, now the right button doesnt work. sure it was dropped few times, but its made for that PLUS more. I cant return it, cause the return date has passed. so now i have a mouse that barely works.. I guess thats why its so cheap. You get what you pay for!"
3,Mouse 3000,"Mouse is fine. It was the way in which it was shipped. I could have used it on my trip to India if I had received it in the timely matter in which I ordered it. So it sat for 30 days unused, and I was very disappointed that it came on the day after I left."
2,Cheap-feeling mouse,"Best thing about this mouse is the packaging. None of that heat-sealed plastic stuff that is next to impossible to get into.The mouse itself, contrary to other reviews is SMALLER than a regular mouse, about 3/4 the size.My main problem with it though is that it feels really cheap. The left and right buttons sound cheap. The battery compartment opens in a cheap way. I'm a big ""wheel user"" for scrolling, and it's NOT a smooth scroll - it's like there's a ratchet/cog in there. What you're scrolling ""jumps"" - I even downloaded Intellipoint 7.0 (the latest version) - that doesn't fix it - even with the slowest scroll. I just can't use it - that would drive me insane.For the price, it's not worth returning it - I'll keep it as a mouse of last resort - but I definitely would not recommend it."
2,Bad Sensor Plug in,"I had to buy this one so that I could replace the plug in sensor from my first purchase that I had only had a month as the cost to only replace the sensor was almost as much as a new mouse. The plug in for this wireless mouse is huge. It is over 2 inches long, and is easy to knock into things and if you accidentially drop your lap top or it falls, it will break, as did mine. The mouse functions great. I was unaware of the other similar mice that had much smaller USB plug ins, or I would not have bought this one to replace the broken Microsoft one. I would highly recommend you look at others instead of this one with the smaller plug ins that are less likely to break or bend. The plug in with this one is an accident waiting to happen. I have no idea why Microsoft made it so big. It is almost as long as the mouse. Stupid idea. But the mouse works great. Sad."
4,wireless mouse,"I purchased the wireless mouse for my laptop about a month ago. Set up is very easy, and it worked right away, unlike the previous mouse where I had to press the connect buttons at least 10 times for it to start working. This mouse has grooves for your fingers, but unlike my older model desktop mouse, after I've use it for about an hour my hand starts to hurt! So it has its pros and cons. I would recommend it, good size and weight. Just be careful if you have anything wrong with your hand from being on the computer 24/7."
2,Bad position tracking,i faced problem using this mouse from day 1. the mouse pointer just jumps from place to other. it has bad tracking. and when u click the pointer moves away from the place where u clicked. its light weight though n easy to carry.
2,Poor battery use,"Doesn't work with rechargeable batteries at all. I've tried nickel cadmium and nickel metal hydride and neither work. Even using good quality alkalines, the mouse will only work if the battery is very fresh. Lightly used batteries that hit the top of the scale in my battery tester fail to work in this mouse. A number of times I've jarred the wireless module loose in my bag and found my batteries ""dead"" a few days later. Heavy users should be prepared to remove the battery before putting it in your suitcase and to buy alkaline batteries and replace them once a month. The mouse is nice, but the pain of the battery issues just isn't worth it."
3,Love /Hate Relationship,"Love this mouse when it is working. Have had two and both died on me after about six months. Think I will try another model or manufacturer this time. But, I LOVED this mouse!"
5,Absolutely excellent,"I picked this mouse up this morning for my laptop to replace my Belkin.I am completely satisifed with this mouse and I'm pretty picky about my mice.Responsive, fast, only 1 battery required (they even give you one).Good job Microsoft. Great great product!"
3,Best Mouse Ever for 4 months,"I got this mouse in June 05' and was very impressed with the design and ease of install. After 3 1/2 months of heavy use the receiver only works intermittently. If I bump it at all the receiver loses power and I have to unplug the replug it in a few times until the light comes back on. I realize there is a certain life to these products and my mouse is used constantly but previous Microsoft wireless mice have lasted more than a year with similar use. I am planning on getting the same model to replace this one and hope that it was just a manufacturing flaw.Overall if the new mouse performs equally well for a longer time, I will not hesitate to recommend to all who will listen."
3,"Overall decent product, somewhat chintzy in areas","The mouse is great for those like myself who hate the little touch pads or the pencil eraser mice on laptops. If you must have a mouse for your laptop, this one will serve you well. It is a bit chintzy in areas like the battery cover, and the USB dongle, but it's the perfect size and price. I just wonder how long it'll last a heavy user."
5,"HP Pavilion DV6275US 15.4"" Entertainment Notebook PC (Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T5600, 2 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti",Everything should operate as wireless. Just the right size for great and fast use.
5,BEST BUY FOR WIRELESS,I use my notebook everywhere and this mouse works great on a variable of surfaces (except glass). It is very durable and comfortable to use. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless mouse. My 7 month old is unable to destroy it and it fits in my pocket = ) You will love it.
5,Perfect Notebook Mouse!,"This is about as perfect as it can get... I was sick and tired of using my laptop next to my desktop with my left hand on the touch pad. I read about the Microsoft Wireless Notebook mouse in the Wall Street Journal and decided to buy it due to the review. This mouse is perfect... simply plug the toggle into the computer and put the battery into the mouse and you have connection!I've tried this mouse on my Vista laptop and it connects within 1-2 seconds of plugging in the USB toggle. There is no lag and the 1000 dpi is nice and precise for a ""notebook"" mouse.Only thing I don't like is the bottom sides of the mouse are a rubber like substance so if you tip the mouse a little it will catch on the mouse pad and not move. This isn't a bother but something to note for people who don't hold their mice evenly like myself.Definitely recommend this for laptop owners."
3,It works well but.......,"I purchased this to use during presentations with a notebook. Oops. Range is only about 3 feet. Guess I missed that in the research. As a close range device, it's a mouse, it's comfortable, and it works without fail."
2,Junk Made In China,"I bought two of these for my college students. One of them stopped working within two weeks. I was able to replace it, but this is typical of shoddy products produced with no quality control. The consumer is the quality control. I don't like getting junk for my hard earned money and then being expected to spend the time, money and effort to get it rectified."
5,Notebook savior.,"I never used my new laptop due to the stupid mouse or lack of it but now I love it, love it and it's wireless."
5,Mouse Purchase,"Works great, much more precise/quick than what I was using previously. Good size in my hand. Arrived quickly."
2,Died Out Of Nowhere,"This mouse was a great solution for my laptop as I have carpal tunnel however yesterday it just died out of nowhere!I received it as a Christmas gift so I've had it about six months.I tried replacing the batteries and reconnecting but it is just dead.I'm glad I checked here on Amazon to see that I'm not even close to the only one that this has happened to!Other downsides:- I DID have to replace the battery within the last six months so Microsoft's claim that is lasts 6+ is bogus.- The USB is a poor design. It sticks out so when I sit in any position other than my laptop being on my desk I have to be careful about not knocking it.I really did like this mouse despite the downsides - it's just so preferable to using my touchpad because of my carpal tunnel. However, now that I'm seeing that other people are having the same issues I was, I'm just going to get another brand."
2,Not quite there with the wireless technology,"While the pointer was quick to respond to movements, and accurate, the obnoxiously large ""receiver"" that has to plug into a USB port easily gets its signal blocked. The mouse is a bit too heavy for quick gaming that can be done with smaller mice, and while the design fits your hand nicely, you'll find yourself picking the mouse up really often. That's certainly not preferable for me, especially in quick-moving games."
4,Good mouse for the money,"you will find yourself replacing the battery if you are a gamer, other then that great mouse, even works great with mac....overall good mouse. just keep spare batteries on hand."
3,It's just OK,"It eats batteries like crazy, I kept having to readjust the mouse. Other than that it's OK, lightweight, fits my small hand comfortably and I enjoyed not having a wire get in my way."
2,malfunctioned after 4 months,"I bought this mouse 4-5 months ago and it worked pretty well until now - suddenly I started getting intermittent problems as skipping and non-responsiveness, even with brand new battery. Today I finally removed it (I may try it later again but I doubt it is going to work) and plugged back the old wired mouse. I like the ergonomics of this product, but 4 months is too short lifetime; I will not bother to buy another one."
2,Broke easily,I only had this product for a couple of months and the USB transmitter broke. It has a hinge that is supposed to make for better reception regardless of the orientation of the USB port. Logitech has a simmiler product that has no moving parts and has been working well for me.
5,Without problems at all...,"I'm a very practical person... the mouse either works or not... this mouse works. Plug it into the notebook or desktop and it works perfectly, just like a regular mouse but without cables!"
2,Very Fragile,"I bought one of these about a year ago, and it stopped working about 6 months later. I bought a new one, and it stopped working yesterday. It's otherwise a nice little device, but it gets expensive replacing them every 6 months. This time I'm going to buy a wired mouse for $10 less."
3,Nice comfortable mouse,"I like the mouse, it fits the hand better than most laptop mouse that i have tried. Too bad that the reception does not work if the receiver is on the left side of the laptop (i am a right-handed). But that same issue also apparent on logitech cordless mouse too.So make sure you have a usb extension cable."
2,Dont waste money on this cheap and yet breakable model,At first everything was ok for 2 months but after then i had trouble with connecting usb reciver was not working. I did not understand the reason. my older logitech mouse is still working although i bought it 2 years ago. it made poorly and it just stop working this week. it is not dependable and no long term investment. It was my first microsoft mouse experience and i will never buy again unless they make dependable mouses not for just two months. I wish they made it dependable otherwise it is a great comfort having it.
4,Wireless Mouse,"I like the sise of this mouse, and the usb connector is smaller than some.The only bad thing I have to say is the battery does not last as long as they say it will. They said 6 months, it lasted maybe a month. I like the responce and the mouse buttons, it fits my hand well."
2,As it gets older,"I bought my optical mouse about a year ago. I was very happy with my puchase back then, but as I began to use the mouse I started to notice one glaring problem. The clip used to secure the wireless conector to the back of the mouse (thus shutting off the battery) just doesn't hold tight enough anymore. Therefor it leaves the battery on and the batteries lasts about a week before your replacing them again. Perhaps Microsoft needs to work out a few kinks."
5,The best mouse I have ever used.,"I work 10 hours a day on-line, and I'm very demanding when it comes to my gear.This is the most comfortable mouse I have ever used.A great feature about it is the fact that it has great reception. Other small wireless mice that I have used tend to have bad reception if the RF connector is far away, not this one. The connection is as good as a wired mouse. It does not interfere with my wireless router, Bluetooth connection or wireless phone connection.Another bonus is the fact that it uses only 1 battery. 1 battery lasted me 3 months.A very smart buy if you ask me."
5,I Love It,"Usually I hate Microsoft hardware, but this mouse is very nice. People at the office are always saying how ""cute"" it is so maybe that's a downside, but whatever. Works real well, but the range is crappy."
2,Mouse doesnt stay connected.,"My USB is on the left side of my laptop, I am right handed so I use my mouse on the right side and it looses connecting by moving it to the right side. The range is horrible, maybe like a foot and it dropped connection and starts blinking and is useless. I should of read other reviews first, seems like this happens a lot with the mouse. The seller was great and provided fast shipping. Try logitech I hear."
4,It made my laptop tired.,"I liked this product. I wanted something similar to the Logitek I already had, but at a lower price. This was what I got. I was disappointed to find that it was too sensitive to use on my laptop. I think the red light (the optical part) was what prevented my laptop from going to sleep. I fought with the computer and mouse combo for two days before switching it to my desktop and returning the logitek to the laptop. It works great on the desktop. No sleep or screensaver issues. Just be aware of this if you are purchasing it for a laptop. It may be too sensitive. But the product works great and is easy to use."
3,not good at long distances,"This mouse works fine when it's near my computer, but when I try to move further away it starts to be spotty."
4,Great most of the time,"Well priced, easy to install and use, lightweight and durable, overall a great buy. Only problem was it would search for connectivity even though it was inches away from the USB key... Not sure what thats about but it doesn't happen often."
3,just OK,"This mouse works fine but it lacks in durability. The weakest link is the USB adapter. If upon bump. it on anything it will quit working and it is quite bulky & has a weak hinge. The Logitech 4450 is a bit more $ but it is much more durable. The USB adapter is smaller, more compact, & no hinge!"
1,Stopped Working after 2 Weeks,"The mouse worked fine, except a little jumpy for my taste, for about two weeks and then stopped working entirely. I changed the battery and still couldn't get it to work. I called Microsoft and asked to return it, rather than replace it, because I had originally purchased it mistakenly thinking it was a Bluetooth mouse. They were polite and understanding over the phone and assured me I would get my money back."
3,Looks cool but overrated,"Okay, on first impressions, this mouse comes out as a very neat gadget.Pros:* Small, compact in size.* Works with AA size battery as opposed to a charging station.Cons:* Having worked with Logitech's MX700, the wireless reception of this Microsoft mouse is definately horrible. The mouse becomes unresponsive once in a while.* If other people are using the same mouse in the vicinity, the signals get distorted and you occasionally loose control on the pointer.* Definately not recommended for gaming, as I've found out. Buy the Logitech one if you want a responsive mouse.In a nutshell: Its small, compact, portable ... Thats the only value it has. The functionality part is rather unimpressive."
5,Awesome Product,I bought this long back and still working. Helps me a lot with long range of laptops. Microsoft it is!!!!
1,Doesn't work,"It's a nice mouse....I supposeNice feel to it, beautiful color...everything is good except the fact that it cannot work!!!!I've tried to connect it to multiple systems to find that it fails to even work...I was very dissipointed in this product"
3,Wheel button too sensitive,"I haven't used this in a long time, but having it at a desktop now I notice the wheel button is accidentally pressed all the time, there is not much of a ""click"" either. I would say it's a 3.5 star because it does become annoying."
3,Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 3000 - Dragon Fruit Pink,"I bought this mouse to replace a different Microsoft mouse I had after my kids destroyed it. It was cheaper and I am less worried about letting them use it because I can replace this one easier. I like it over all, but there is a feature the slightly more expensive Microsoft mobile mouse(3500) has that this doesn't: the back button. I browse the internet relentlessly and that feature is the BEST. I will probably buy one of those again for myself and keep this one for my kids. The only other problem I have with this mouse and other Microsoft mice like it is the USB wireless connector. It sticks out from my laptop about 1.5"" and it gets knocked into things quite a bit. If you can look pass those things, it is a great mouse."
4,"Convenient, cute, battery & product lasts","I bought this for my Mom who is finally getting a laptop for Christmas. I have had one of my own for about 4 years. I love that the USB sticks into the back to preserve the battery and so you won't lose it. The Dragon Fruit Pink color verges on red, so beware of that; But this is fine by me because my Mom prefers red. (Honestly, I got this color because the price was marked down.)"
3,Just didn't work for me,"My first wireless mouse, and just enough minor quirks to make me stop using it and get a wired one."
5,Perfect!,What is there not to like about this gem of a wireless mouse? I thought the price was good. Product works great and is designed handsomely. Maybe I'll buy one for my other hand too. I love this item!
5,Perfect Mouse Ready for Use,"I love this mouse! So glad I spent the money on it since I found it was a very reasonable price considering how much I use it. This mouse works perfectly, is small and compact for easy traveling,fits my hand perfect, and has a very long battery life since I haven't needed to change it for almost a year. Great product, would recommend to anyone."
3,Not a replacement for the corded 3000...sigh...,"Hubby just brought this mouse home for me. My desk is crampier than it used to be, and the cord on my Notebook Optical Mouse 3000 (also a MS product) kept getting in the way. Well, this new one is longer and also higher than the old one, and it is already beginning to hurt my wrist. I will go back to my corded one for now and keep looking for a smaller wireless mouse that is more comfortable. But, this is convenient and works well."
2,Didn't last,"I purchased two of these on January 20, 2008. The second one, just like the first three months ago, stopped working tonight. Up until then they were great little mouses. Mice. Whatever. The first one seemed a fluke. But two? Disappointed."
2,eventually just stopped working---not the battery,"I've had this mouse for about a year and a half. It worked great until last week when it just stopped working. I replaced the battery three times with newly recharged, and then brand-new batteries, to no avail. It works for a few seconds, then craps out.I've read this complaint a lot online since. Yes, it's inexpensive to buy and it worked well for a while. But I find it annoying that it's suddenly landfill."
1,Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 3000 -Slate,"One of the worst Microsoft products I have ever purchased. I cannot believe Microsoft will compromise its quality in this way. Often the cursor gets stuck. Wanted to return, but I thought after paying shipping it will not be worth."
1,Very Iffy,"After all the hype of the wireless mouse, I decided to figure I'd go for the best known brand. Microsoft. Come to find out, their product, which I paid about thirty dollars for, is cheap. The USB receiver broke and I found myself trying to fiddle with it to get it to work. It's really a waste of time and definitely not a good investment."
4,Small Mouse Nimble Performance,"I just got this mouse 24 hrs ago, but I have to say I love it. I am 6' tall with not small hands, when I first used this mouse it is kind of undersize, needs some time to get used to it. After using this mouse surfing the Internet for a few hours I am totally get used to it. I can use my fingers instead of using my wrist to operate it. With the price under $20, it is a great buy.I let the receiver plug into my laptop for several hours a day, the red light of the mouse is always on, just want to see how long will the battery last. (I only snap the receiver into the mouse before I go to bed.)"
4,Love my pink mouse!,"I love my new little pink mouse! With no cord, I have the freedom to move about on my desk. I wish I had spent a little more and gotten a model with an off switch. To save the battery, I have to remove the USB plug at the end of each use. At least the mouse has a handy little storage place on it for the USB plug. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
3,Not as I have imagined,"The quality is fine. I bought it for my PC, but it only work within one meter. So I have to insert the little flash thing in front of my computer. Maybe it is good for laptop."
2,Not a good choice.,"While this mouse performs well and uses only one AA battery, the ergonomics and quality are poor. The rubber coating where my thumb resides has started to deteriorate and peel off after just a few months of usage. The mouse wheel is smooth in the backwards motion but clunks when changing direction to a forward motion. It's a fair mouse that is fine for periodic usage but not for daily use. There are better choices."
3,True experiance with Microsoft Optical Mouse 3000,"The lazer resolution is extremely high, a titty titty tad off the syching with the Windows; it is enough for you to call it precision. But if you are known in your area that is known for bad air wave interferences; then the mouse is totally useless and will gitter of your controls. This mouse is although truly better than the original Microsoft wired mouse when holding it in the hand. On one batter of the Energizer Ultimate Lithium, it lasted for months."
1,Problematic,"Problems : The range on this mouse is very limited, the battery life is short (The mouse seems to always be on. The only time the light goes off is when the dongle is plugged into the base), and best for last... all you have to do is look at the dongle the wrong way and it disconnects from the mouse.Pro : It doesn't cost much."
5,Great little wireless mouse!,We've had one of these for years and just purchased a second since my husband and I were always fighting over the one. : )
4,Pretty Good,"This mouse is extremely convenient, being a college student. I transport my laptop all across town every week and it's nice to be able to have a cordless mouse. The connection can fail sometimes and the bottom is touchy to surfaces, but overall, I'm happy in the investment."
4,Muy comodo y pequeño...pero...,El mouse es excelente para lo que me costo (20$ en oferta)...y la bateria me ha durado desde que lo compre y es solo 1 bateria AA...el unico detalle que le veo es que al poner el adaptador usb por debajo del mouse...este sobresale un poco del mouse entonces cuando pones el mouse con la cara del laser a la mesa queda como levantado :S:..pero de resto es excelente :Dsaludos!!
1,MS Mice are HORRIBLE!,This is my 2nd Microsoft Mouse. Both died within 1 year. I have no idea why...never dropped them and they still died. Even the batteries outlasted the mice. MS needs to tighten their quality control...its sad.
5,Great Mouse!,I use this mouse on a Mac desktop computer. It's small in size but not too small like regular laptop mouses. It works well and the battery life is good. Not too jumpy on the screen. Would recommend it.
1,Receiver easily gets broken,The old design which has two piece receiver can be easily broken. MS refused to replace it saying 'receiver is not under the warranty'. Unsatisfactory.
4,Good product,"The mouse is a good size ,not so small that it gets lost in your hand but campact enough to be truly portable. Has easy set up , just plug and play."
3,good but loses signal easily,"I really dont have alot of problems with this mouse besides the fact that if you barely bump the USB receiver, it loses signal and you have to remove the USB receiver and put it back in. It IS VERY picky on the surfaces it works on."
2,Don't drop it!,"I like the mouse and how it works, but this is the second one we've had. The first one I dropped ONCE and it no longer worked. Bought another one because the price is right and I was too lazy to figure out if there were better ones out there. I do like how you can turn off the mouse to save battery life."
4,Great product but short battery life,"Performs as expected but has a shorter battery life than other wireless mice i've purchased. Otherwise, the color and qualtiy is on par with product description."
5,Great inexpensive mouse,This is my second purchase of the same mouse model. Works great for me on nearly all surfaces (with or without mousepad) except for a pure white poreless desktop. Easily stuffs into accesssory pouch and USB transceiver snaps into bottom when not in use.
2,Mouse without control,"To be a mouse Microsoft it bran, it is not very good, when I use it with Microsoft Excel, it behaves very strange, and it begins to rotate toward the end of the spreadsheet without control.I don't really like anything."
4,great mouse,"i've used two other wireless mice...the microsoft 1000 [bulky and unreliable] and microsoft 4000. after 3 years of the 4000, it showed noticable wear so i decided to get a new mouse. the 3000[the one being reviewed] was on sale for $10, so i bought it. ITS DEFINITELY WORTH IT. it does everything you need for a basic mouse, for a good price.only negative is the middle button [scroll click wheel] is VERY sensitive, so it'll magnify or whatever you set it to do, randomly."
4,Good basic travel mouse.,"This is a pretty basic mouse. It works well, and fits my smallish hand quite well. I like that the usb receiver stores in the bottom of the mouse when not in use, prolonging battery life. The receiver is about the size of a flash drive, and I have had no problems using with my laptop. I like the frustration-free packaging as well, but it would be nice if it were the same price as regular pricing."
1,very unreliable,"Clearly the quality control on this product is terrible, since some people report a good experience with it. Mine worked fine for about 2 months, since then it's erratic, which of course means unusable in practice.Also, I found that I heartily disliked the fussy design of the key storage -- if you don't get it in exactly right it doesn't turn off the switch."
3,Good mouse but a little too small,The mouse works flawlessly; I have one major problem with it however. It is too small for my hands.
1,Cable is better,I don't know if is me or the wireless mouse. I recommend to buy with cable.I already put this mouse in my garage sale.
1,never got it,"never got this item, had to get money back for it. a month and never got it, even emailed them, nothing happened, sucks, and never doing business with them again"
1,doesn't even work,"the mouse doesn't work. I'm now trying to get refund or replacement. after trying several batteries and making sure it's the new mouse that doesn't work, i'm sure it's the mouse that died on me after 1 day of use."
3,"It's okay. Not fancy, but it will do.","I have had it for a little while and it is working great. No problems, just your basic mouse."
3,Mircrosoft Wireless Optical Mouse 3000-Winter Blue,"This mouse is fine. Not the best out there, but it does the job. Was delivered in a timely manner. It was used, so it didn't arrive in original packaging, but did come with all of the instructions etc."
4,MICROSOFT WIRELESS NOTEBOOK OPTICAL MOUSE,"This is one handy gadget. It works exactly as described. Movement is quick and decisive. Same battery now for well over 2 months, and I use it a lot. Only draw back is having to remove the wireless transmitter from the USB port in order to turn it off. A slide switch might be a little more convenient, but this way you always know where the little bugger is. Size may be small for some, however it fits my hand well and I can use it a good distance away from my computer."
2,Stopped working after 4 months!!,"Loved this mouse until today when after TWO separate battery changes (and I had put in a new one just a few days ago) the mouse completely stopped working. Surprising, since most of the other reviews were positive, but I've tried everything."
4,Great Mouse for the price; lasts about a year,"Great mouse. Lasts a long time on one battery. The product lasted about two years before it stopped reading correctly. The color is a really ugly brown, but this color was about $7 less than one of the better looking colors."
2,Not recommended,"order rec'd promptly from seller, no issues there at all.mouse stopped working after 3 months, and could not get operational even after changing batteries, unplugging/replugging usb. not worth returning to microsoft under warranty at this price even with a 3 year limited warranty as replacement shipping just adds insult to injury. eats up batteries very quickly and with no on/off switch on the device, it means removing the battery when not in use to conserve.sometimes you do get what you pay for unfortunately."
3,Not too bad not too good,"I have bought both Microsoft and Logitech mice. Honesty, the Logitech's one is beter (Logitech M305 Wireless Mouse (Black)). The Microsoft's one is larger, has more moving parts and lower battery life time. Besides, its wireless receptor has the size of a big pen drive. It works and is good, but I prefer the Logitech's mouse."
4,Great mouse !!,Great product for the price.. its small size fits perfectly in hand.. no issues in using.. works perfect even from diatnace... just need to improve upon packaging..
1,not so good,I cannot get the mouse to work with my new HP laptop. There is some software conflict that I cannot resolve.
2,Waste of Money,This mouse barely functions on my desk without placing it on a book or something. It also doesn't have a good range. The range must be 1 metre which is no good if you are trying to use it for your PC to control info going through the HDMI cable to the TV.The battery gets used even when the mouse is not moving so if you leave the USB plugged in the battery is running down.Microsoft you can do better. Why make something like this that is not useful?
3,Worked for a 18 months till the wheel crapped out,"Worked really well while with good battery life (maybe 2 or 3 batteries in that time) till the scroll wheel stopped working. The mouse still works, but will no wheel it's garbage. For this price, I will probably order another"
5,Works fine. no problems so far,I haven't had the thing much longer than a month but it seems to be working so far.
1,poor quality,"When the mouse worked, it was great. 8 months later I get ""USB device not recognized"" errors with both of my laptops. Based on reading previous reviews I guess the receiver is broken?I don't think I'll buy this again."
2,"Good at home, useless in my job office","I used to use my mouse in my job, it was ok, the batteries lasted the first time around 4 months, but when another guy from the office bought a Microsoft Wireless Mouse Laser 6000 it started the nightmare, when he uses his mouse mine get frozen or works intermitently, I guess my mouse is not protected enough from interference, and it only happens with the other Microsoft mouse, another people in my office had a Logitech mouse and I did not have problems with mine.So take care, this mouse is ok for home, or in an isolated place, not for the office... unless you work alone."
5,Excellent plug-n-play must have!,"One of the best investments I've ever made. An absolute must for travelers or anybody else that is tethered to their laptop.Simple plug and go installation, no software or setup required. Very responsive, works on almost any type of surface, good battery life which is enhanced with the stowaway USB dongle in the bottom of the mouse which turns off the battery while you're on the move. The buttons and scroll wheel work just as they should...instantaneous response and very accurate. No complaints here and if its Microsoft I'll usually find something to complain about. I average about a 3 month life from a single AA battery, bring a spare for backup. 5 clicks."
2,Essential for mobile workers,"A small USB mouse is essential for mobile workers and I have to say I really like this one. The contour feels nice on the hand and is comfortable to use with my small hands. I didn't have to install any drivers, which was an added bonus; Windows just picks it up and works like a charm everytime I plug in the USB adapter (considering this is a Microsoft product I would expect no less). The only thing I wish this had is a back/forward button on the thumb rest like some other mouses have.**update**After about 3 years of rare use, the plastic piece that disables the mouse when the USB adapter is inserted stopped working properly and resulted in the mouse not working at all."
4,Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 3000,"Pretty cool. I'm not a ""puter geek"" so I can't speak personally for the range or quality of performance, but it's fun to play with anyway!"
2,Poor workmanship,this mouse suffers poor workmanship. the wireless usb adapter suffers from loss of connectivity at random times and is a trial to get work there after.
3,eats batteries,"I have to put a new battery (I use the ones for digital cameras, not the cheap ones) every 3-4 days, but overall, it's a good mouse."
2,"Great for a while, and then not so good","This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned. After one year is when all of the problems started. The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all. I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help. It is very tempremental, and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement.So, a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while, just be prepared to replace it in a year or so."
5,Excellent,"Plug and play with no fuss.Also, for anyone interested in tweaking the settings for this mouse, go to your control panel and click mouse. There should be a list (if you are using a laptop there will be atleast two) then select this one and alter whatever you need. I have mine customized perfectly on a laptop running XP. I would buy it over again in a heartbeat!Hope this helps."
4,Great idea!,"I love the design of this mouse,especially the snap in receiver, that fits under the bottom of the mouse when not in use,this way you will never lose it. Would have given it 5 stars but the mouse is not sensitive enough."
4,Great Notebook Mouse,"Install battery, plug receiver into a USB port and go to work. Would have been nice to get the software with the mouse but it is easily downloaded from Microsoft. Great mouse at a great price."
5,Super Product,"This is the perfect mouse - small enough to tote around yet large enough to feel like a real tool in my hand. Only bluetooth would make it better, but without that the small USB receiver is wonderfully compact and pops into the bottom of the mouse for travel. Battery life is pretty long - I have used this mouse extensively every day for almost three months and I just changed the battery for the first time yesterday."
2,It worked great and then died on me,"This was a fantastic product (while it worked), but for some reason after a year it up and quit on me. I've read other reviews that it may be an issue with the USB, but whatever the problem is, it's annoying! I expected a Microsoft brand mouse to last for a lot longer. When I contacted Microsoft they told me there was nothing they could do since the warranty was up."
5,Excellent mouse!,"I've owned this mouse for over 2 months, and I love it! It works on all but the blackest of surfaces. I love the way it stores: the connector just snaps into the bottom of the mouse and turns it off at the same time. This is a great little invention..."
4,Great mouse BUT...,"I've always been partial to Microsoft Mice. I love the ergonomics and design, and this mouse is no exception. There is one major issue with this mouse and it will only effect some users. Specifically, right-handed users with usb ports on the left side of the laptop, or left-handed users with usb ports on the right side. This is because the wireless received does not work well if the mouse is used on the opposite side of the receiver. My laptop doesn't have ports on the back so I don't know how well it will work in that configuration. I do love everything else about the mouse so much that rather than return the mouse I use a usb extension cable to relocate the receiver to the right side of my laptop.Pros- Ergonomics- Style- Battery life- Receiver snaps to mouse when not in use and turns of mouse automaticallyCon- Mouse doesn't respond well if used on the opposite side of the laptop from the receiver."
5,Great Little Mouse!,This is just what I was looking for...small enough yet not too small. This is great little mouse for anyone that is looking for a wireless mouse for either a desktop or laptop.
2,"Beautiful mouse, horrible performance","I purchased this mouse as an upgrade when I built a new computer. I loved the Winter Blue color. Unfortunately, the mouse performed so poorly, I replaced it within a week or two. The mouse pointer would stop midway and then act as if the mouse was not plugged in constantly, then work again like normal...only to ""lag out"" again shortly after. I tried a new battery, although the battery that was in it was also supposed to be new, to no avail. I tried using different usb ports, but it never changed. I got about 5 minutes of uninterrupted use out of it when I took my wife's plain, black $5 mouse pad to use. Five minutes later the problems returned.Microsoft makes some good and bad products. Unfortunately, this one did not work out too well with my desktop. Even with a USB extension port that put the receiver within less than a foot of the mouse."
2,Small Range,"I love the design and color of this device, but the range is very short. My computer is under my desk, and the mouse works if it is right above the tower, but if I move it to the right of the keyboard then it is out of range. Another 8 feet or so of range would do wonders for this device!"
1,Wireless Mouse,"I was not happy with this purchase. I tried to contact the seller mutiple times about their product and never heard anything back from them. The product came to me scratched up and the button to release the top to put the batteries in is partly jammed so its hard to get it to open, and the mouse stops working from time to time and gets disconnected from my computer frequently.I would not recommend this seller to anyone."
2,Okay,"I've gotten this mouse twice, and found that both had the same problems after a month or two. They both would stop clicking (right or left). So I could scroll, but couldn't click on anything. At that point it's just useless. I ordered a second one of this model because I assumed that the problem was a fluke, but it turned out to be a consistent problem. It wasn't battery problems either; I would have the same problem with a fresh set of batteries."
4,Wireless mouse,"This mouse is very versatile. It is a very well built mouse and is very useful. The only problem with this mouse is the battery power, however it is one of the longer lasting battery life batteries, it is still very short."
5,Even Works on Wood Night Stand or Uneven Bed Sheets,"What else can I say? Works great, even on non-ideal surfaces like wood night stand or uneven bed sheets. No install required. The battery saving feature seems to only turn off the mouse when you unplug the USB receiver and dock back onto the bottom of the mouse (which helps to keep you from losing the receiver). It would be nice for it to also turn off the mouse when I put my laptop to sleep, but that's a very minor issue that should not stop you from buying this product."
3,A good product but......,I like the wireless mouse but it's reach is not very far.When I plug in to UBS in the rear of my tower the mouse is jumpy and intermittent but when I use the USB on the front of my tower it works perfectly.I checked and it is not a battery problem.
2,Good product -- while it lasts,"This is a good product, but I've gone through two of them in about six months. Enough is enough -- I've switched to a much better designed Logitech mouse."
5,Review of Microsoft Wireless Optical Notebook Mouse 3000,Excellent compact product. I have had it for 4 weeks now and I have bought a second for my dad as well. Such a far cry from the bulky mice of the past with big USB receivers - the receiver for this one fits right underneath the mouse for easy transport. A sure winner.
2,It was an okay mouse when it worked.,"I've had this mouse for about a year now. I hesitated on spending the money, but figured the Microsoft name meant quality, so I went for it. Unfortunately their mouse is buggy just like many of their applications. When it worked it was comfortable, easy to use, and I especially liked how the receiver snapped into the bottom of the mouse when not in use. Unfortunately getting it to work was a headache. It ate batteries and I usually had to hit the 'connect' button to make it recognize that it was connected. Today it apparently gave up the ghost and is working no longer...no new battery or fiddling seems to be bringing it back. Sad. Based on this experience, I don't see another Microsoft Mouse in my future."
5,Love it,"This is a great mouse, has worked perfectly for me, is very small and compact, comes with batteries, and overall has a good design. also, i usually have my laptop and my desktop literally right next to each other, and i have a Microsoft wireless mouse for both of them, and this one never interferes with the desktop one!!!! pretty sweet."
4,Wireless Mouse,"Nice little mouse, not too big or heavy. Responsive and without wires it is a pleasure to use."
2,Good-Died In Four Months Though,"I expect my mice to work reliably and to be comfortable (and portable when it comes to notebook mice). This one did all of that for its limited lifespan. It conformed to my hand, and the reciever tucked neatly in the slot built into the mouse. It worked flawlessly, and linked quickly to other computers I linked it to as well. However, after about four months of use, it decided to work sporatically, then not even connect to the reciever. I think this had to do with the reciever, not the mouse itself. Otherwise, not much to say about it. Buy it if you just want it for a short term thing, otherwise there are better options.PS: Battery life was great-I never had to replace the battery once during the 4 months."
1,BOYCOT this product!!!,"Kinda harsh heading, I know. But I am on my 2nd mouse of this particular design. Great idea! HORRIBLE design! And I think they designed it this way knowing what would happen so as to increase sales.So what happened?? The USB dongle broke both times....it's all in the design. The dongle is essentially 2 peices, and the outer peice pivots (maybe for better communication with the mouse?...nah!!). The problem with the pivoting part is that it goes so far, and then breaks. The wires BREAK internally if you go beyond that point. Did Miscrosoft implement some kind of safety stop on the housing? Of course not!!BOYCOT!!They do make another one that is one peice...I will probably exchange my broken one for this (if I can - it's been a few months)."
1,this mouse is not good,"it is not sensitive, very slow and time consuming to move the cursor on the screeen.I have to return it."
1,Disappointment,"This is the least accurate mouse we own, and we own more than a handful. I was using this mouse on a broad armed leather chair. Every mouse I've ever used on the chair has performed very well. It's almost a perfect material for a mouse pad -- firm, not shiny, not rigid. Yes this mouse just tracks poorly. Also, the Logitech optical mouse we've bought has a more convenient storage device for the USB dongle. This one has to be pried off. The Logitech one just slides into a slot."
4,works well,This product worked as advertised: it was easy plug-in and use. Pay attention to the angle between the mouse and the plug-in as failure to keep them aligned will result in losing control of the mouse. Just follow the directions really.
1,worked great for a while,"I loved this while it worked. I ordered several for my employees. Now I regret it. I've never had a product fail so quickly. I will try and return or get my money back. I am willing to give it one more try if they can replace it with another, if that one fails...I am done."
2,Stopped working after one drop,Worked great for a few months. Dropped it on the floor once and now it's all done.
5,Great mouse-bad packaging,"Mouse is just what I wanted only wish it had one more optional button--it only had the wheel button which I use for BACK and would have liked a FORWARD command as well. Only complaint, thought I was getting the Amazon no-frills package but ended up with the plastic-from-hades encasement that took kitchen shears to cut open. What stupid packaging engineers design this crap? Right, none, just some idiot in the lab."
4,great mouse but does not hold up,I bought two of these mice about a year ago and really like the thing but both have failed after about a year. I have a third one I bought a few weeks ago and I hope it holds up longer than a year. I need to replace the second one that failed but I am not sure about getting another one of these. I have now had four of these mice and not a one of them has lasted for more than a year. Some only six months. I kept buying them because of a good price and while it kept working it was a great mouse. But I give up going to have to try some other brand.
5,Love it,"This mouse worked perfectly from the minute I plugged it into my netbook (HP Mini). I didn't have to load any software, press any buttons, and it was there. It's just the right amount of sensitivity and couldn't be better. My husband has the same one and is equally happy with it. I was originally concerned to get the HP mouse to avoid any possible conflicts, but was told I was better off matching to the operating system, which is Windows, and Microsoft. It was good advice and I couldn't be happier."
5,"Great mouse, great price","Great mouse for a great low price. Comfortable, great color selection, plug-and-go, no software needed, love the snap-in usb storage."
1,Conked off in a month!!!,It was working great for a month. and then it just conked off! My colleague uses a logitech and it's been doing well for a while now. No more microsoft wireless for me!
2,average mouse,"average mouse. not as comfortable as I thought. gliding felt funny comparing to regular cord optical mouse. kind of small for my palm to really use it effectively. when I have to do alot of clicking, I would go back to my regular mouse. been using for a month and still have a hard time getting use to the gliding. but definitely easy to plug in and get it to work."
1,Dies after a few months,"The connectivity never was very good, and then after a few months, it just died. Much better luck with a Logitech mouse which has lasted a few years."
1,Microsoft wireless mouse -- not good at all,"I bought this mouse to replace a wireless Logitech mouse which I broke. I've had the Microsoft mouse for about 3 weeks and just bought another Logitech to replace it. In fairness to Microsoft, I'm using this on a laptop running Linux, not Windows.I plugged it in, Linux picked it up and all seemed fine. But the range is VERY poor, it frequently loses connectivity (even at a short distance from the receiver) and I needed to reset it on a regular basis. Frequently the cursor will track the mouse but the buttons don't respond. Frequently the motion sensor seems confused by my desktop (which is faux wood) and cursor tracking is a random event.Overall, I've found this mouse to be worth disposing of -- not much more. My experience with Logitech has been much better."
5,No Harm - No Foul,"I've had mine almost four years... not one problem including battery consumption.It's comfortable to use for hours at a time, it's never been on a mouse pad, and the price is right.I've even purchased a secound as a back-up for the eventual day when the only moving part, the scrole wheel, goes ""Putzz"". That should tell you why I would recomend this to anyone."
4,good enough,"i recently purchased 46inch tv and wanted to stay in my bed while watching movies and still be able to control my computermouse itself is pretty good, works fine and fast, accurately, but max distance is only about a meter.my mouse wouldnt work when im on my bed so i just gave this to my girlfrined and bought new one with 2.7ghz thingy..."
1,Cheap piece of crap,"The item arrived brand new in box. Everything looked fine until I tried using the mouse. The mouse would not even light up. I used the battery that it came with and tried another working battery to no avail. The connect button was pressed many times to try to get it to work with the receiver, which seems to be working as the light comes up when connected to usb port. After an hour of frustration, the area with the battery got very hot and I had to take the battery out. It was a big mistake to buy this lower price Microsoft mouse over the Logitech mouse. Avoid this mouse and spend the extra mouse to get the Logitech brand."
2,"with several months of using, it never worked well","I like it at the first sight. But now it never worked well. this not means that it is out of work, but some time worked, sometimes out of work. Firstly, I thought it must need a new battery, when I changed a new battery for it, it's condition not become any better. I feel sad about it"
2,1 year of use,"I've had this for about a year with no problems but suddenly this morning, I discovered that the scroll had gotten ""smooth"" and doesn't work as well. Needless to say, I need to get a new one. I wouldn't say it's a good-quality mouse, but it's nice and compact and good for someone who travels a lot from place to place. Nevertheless, if you want a sturdier mouse, get a wired one."
2,It was a dud,"It would jump all over the place, with new batteries and on different surfaces. I do know these to be great mice. Its just that this one wasn't."
3,works,it works very good and it's super responsive I really like this mouse but how everyone else said it falls a bit short due to not having a off button but other then that it seems like a sturdy mouse I hope it lasts me for a good while.
5,great portable mouse,"I bought this mouse more than two years ago, and I love it. I was travelling every week for work with a laptop, and this mouse is a great way to keep my wrists off the edge of my laptop as I work for 10 hours/day. The responsiveness is great (never had it jump or not respond), and it works great with my Dell Latitude D600 as a plug and play device (never had any problems with the mouse not being recognized after I plug in the USB adapter, which hides neatly on the bottom of the mouse or the computer freezing after I plug it in).Also, the battery life is great; I use it every weekday and can only remember replacing the battery once since I got it.A very solid choice..."
4,Very functional but not what I'd hoped,"I picked this pink wireless mouse up for my wife to use with her pink Aspire One. The mouse works great. The pink is an interesting color but doesn't match the Aspire One and may not match anything else that's really pink.My biggest issue is the size. I guess when they called it a 'notebook' mouse, I assumed it would be small. It's the same size as any other computer mouse. The wireless dongle that plugs into your USB seems pretty giant by today's standards too. If my wife carried a full-sized computer bag none of this would matter but the Aspire One is so small, we were hoping this mouse would be small too.In summary, the mouse works fine, the pink shade is interesting but hard to match, the mouse is full-sized, the wireless dongle is full-sized."
3,"A great little mouse, until...","I bought this mouse in-store about a year ago & loved it. I have the USB receiver plugged into a USB calculator pad & have had no problems with it on my Compaq laptop. It's running on either it's first or second battery & I tend to leave the laptop running 24/7.I gave this mouse three stars because for about the past week, my wheel either has not worked at all (it just spins around & does nothing) or I have to roll it to one side to get it to work. Frankly, I had a cheap-o optical wired mouse ($5) that's lasted longer than this one. This is quite unfortunate because I truly loved this mouse. Now, I don't want to try another for fear of having to replace it again in another year."
2,Great...when it works,"This mouse is fantastic when it works, purchased it along with a Toshiba laptop from Amazon (great seller). Only complaint, the usb thingy needs to be plugged in firmly two or three times to make it work. Doesn't matter which usb port I use so likely is not the computers fault. Could be I got a dud cuz everyone else seems to have had a good experience with it. Not sure I would buy this one next time, though."
4,Good Wireless Mouse,"Got it for my wife. Work had provided her one, so she wanted it on the home PC. Works just like the other. Plugs and plays flawlessly.What I don't like about it is that the interface dongle has to be unplugged from the USB in order to turn off the mouse. The dongl;e is made to fit in a place under the mouse which keeps the off button pushed. Got a dummy dongle to use instead?"
2,"Starts out good, doesn't last","I liked my first Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse I bought a year ago to use with my laptop so much that I bought two more within the last six months, one for my desktop and one for my business use laptop. The mouse has great features, I liked the small ""tail"" and the especially the fact that the tail can swing to multiple positions to accommodate other USB plug-ins. However, that swinging tail doesn't seem to hold up for long. All three of our mouses (mice) are experiencing the same problem with losing connectivity to the PC, we can wiggle the tail or turn it to another position and it may, or may not, light its little green ""good to go"" light. Very, very aggravating, we expected better from Microsoft branded products."
1,Buy a Logitech,"I thought I'd give Microsoft a chance with the notebook mouse as a change from the Logitech I use on my personal laptop. I have had this mouse less then a year and the scroll wheel has gone bad. The scroll wheel intermittently goes out and there is no longer that distinguishable ""bite"" when turning... then the bite comes back and it works again.The scroll wheel was just the last straw. Firstly, battery life is terrible. I would say between 3 to 4 months tops. It only uses a single AA battery compared to the Logitech's 2 AA. As a result the Logitech 4 times longer.Secondly, the mouse is very unresponsive at times. I don't know if it has a sleep mode or goes into power save mode, but it doesn't track well at times and is sluggish then ""wakes up"". No problem on my other mouse.I can't in good faith recommend this mouse to anyone. Go with the Logitech."
3,good but not so good,"as a mouse this product is great if you sit at a desk and have the desktop next to you.......when i say next to you i mean within a metre.i bought it so i could plug my laptop into my 40 inch plasma and sit on the sofa at home and navigate round my computer......downside it only worked upto 1 metre, tried to find this in the description but no info was provided. so basically i have wasted my money. Wasnt looking for it to work over 10m but realistically thought it would of worked line of sight across 3mit is a good mouse, easy to use just plug and play and would be great at a desk but if you use it in a ops room or at home consider the range and buy a bluetooth one"
3,Inferior Product but you get what you pay for,"I bought two of these mice at the local Circuit City when they ran a sale at $15- a pop. I like the compact design and the beautiful color of the mice (came in different color, the one i like the most are the pink and the jade green). unfortunately, the performance of the mice is not there. I positioned the mouse within 1 foot from the UBS device but it failed to ""pinpoint"" the area i wanted and many times, it ""lost"" track of the location i pointed at. At the very best, this mouse does not deliver consistent performance. since i own two, i switched the mouse to see if this is a random error on one but found that both mice have the same issue. i am giving these mice away to the local Salvation Army and do some tax write off. this mouse may be good for child play but definitely not for professional use. however, for $15-, i am not complaining, you get what you pay for."
1,The little mouse that couldn't,Bought this for my wife for Christmas as a laptop mouse. It works only intermittently. It is very light and quite small. Definitely would not recommend this product.
5,Fantastic,"This is a great mouse. Ne problems, plug in play with XP. Very sensitive, great battery life."
4,Very nice for the price,"Bought it for my wife's laptop. Works great and never had problems with distance away from the laptop. The only thing I would make better is how the USB transmitter snaps onto the base. It protrudes out when snapped in, and is not very snug. Easy to knock off the base when storing it away."
3,OK quality,I used it for quite a while but it became very unreliable at the end. Now I'm using Logitech and prefer it to this Microsoft mouse.
3,Nothing wrong with the mouse,"The mouse does its job well, it's just that the USB connection is so big it has to be taken out every-time you put the laptop in the case. No fault of the product just me for buying one with such a full size USB connection."
4,"Good sturdy mouse, no annoying back button :)","A nice, sturdy, responsive mouse that works much better than the new Logitech junk they are marketing now. I went with Microsoft for my tablet PC's bluetooth mouse as well."
1,broke,Cheap made in China JUNK! Buy USA. This broke 2 days after I got it. JUNK JUNK JUNK JNUK JUNK!
5,esta mono,"buena calidad de productos que recomiendo puedas obtener en este lugar, desesperado mi cliente y consegui justo lo que necesitaba"
5,Mouse,I finally got around to putting in a review on this product. Purchased over 2 yrs ago and works great. I use almost every day and have replaced the AA battery 1x. Excellent.
2,Nice features ONE BIG FLAW,If I find a solution for this I will amend my review.The mouse is designed for portable use. Pop the USB transceiver into the bottom of the mouse and it turns off the battery. WONDERFUL. Only needs one small AAA battery. Rechargeables work great for this.It's small for a full size mans hand but I can deal with it as it is also small in my laptop bag.Response is great for a laptop but gets rough on a desktop with a desk between you and the mouse. But folks it is a PORTABLE MOUSE. Use it on a laptop and performance is fantastic.THE BIG FLAWIt won't let my laptop screen turn off. (Toshiba Satellite - Vista) Will burn forever as long as the mouse transceiver is plugged into the USB port. This only disqualifies this product for it's intended purpose.If I find a solution to the problem I will amend my review.
4,"Good, but it's missing one feature that I'd like","The mouse works great. It fits my hand comfortably and it feels solid. The only complaint I have is that the USB adapter protrudes from the bottom of the mouse by a small amount when it's being stored. It isn't a flush fit and it doesn't sit flat on my desk. Not a big deal, but it could be slightly better. I wouldn't say this should change your mind when choosing a product, but those with OCD might find this mouse to be a little frustrating =PBuy it for mobile use. You'll like it. Especially if you like the basic Microsoft Optical Mouse for desktops. I wouldn't use this one for gaming though."
5,Great mouse for any type of computer,I own and use three of these. One for each computer. I got my GF a pink version and my dad a red. Long battery life if you remember to unplug the USB plug and snap it back under the mouse when you leave your computer off for a number of days. None of the mice have failed me! Small enough to carry in your accessory pocket of your computer bag. But not small enough that a guy like me with decent sized hands cannot easily use.
5,I am satisfied,I purchased this mouse (Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 3000)1.5 month ago. It was with AA-battery. Regardless of everyday using. It battary still works. Good precision. Good quality.
5,great product,i love this product. although my laptop has it's mouse i really prefer this wireless one when i'm at home. you gave me such a great deal too. how could i pass it up.
5,Best notebook mouse I've tried,"Before buying this one, I looked at about 15 other corded and cordless notebook mice. I own a kensington pocket mouse and a targus mini, both of which are very uncomfortable to use. The Microsoft is the only mouse I found which didn't become annoying and uncomfortable after a half an hour. It is taller, or thicker than other mice which is why I think it's more comfortable. It is very accurate, even when used on a wood table for example. I like how the usb receiver piece is small and fits into the mouse when not in use. It is sort of like a bluetooth receiver, only usb - a very cool feature.Definately a worthwhile purchase if you travel and use your laptop a lot and if you hate the touchpad (as most people do.)In my opinion it is the best mouse for notebooks that's out right now."
4,Good product,"I have this product, I own a labtop with a very good touch pad my labtop is an acer computer. The reason why I bought this mouse is because is easier to play games with a mouse the with your finger. It works great, the only reason why I did not gave it a five starts is because it does not have a forward and backward button in it. If you have windows xp you won't need to download any software is just plug and play."
2,Nice mouse for two weeks,"Nice little mouse, my wife and daughter both loved it until it stopped working after a couple weeks, twice. That's right, I figured the first was a fluke, so I returned it and got another. Same thing happened. The light that says ""link"" just wouldn't come on, so I think the problem was in the antenna, not the mouse, as the optical laser would still come on. Too bad, because it really is a nice mouse."
2,Mouse worked only for a short period,"This was a really nice mouse....everything I expected! However, its lifespan left me with a lot to be desired....not even 2 months past before this item just quit working. Now I am forced to purchase something new once again. Perhaps this item is still under its warranty, but prior experience with those situations led me to write this review instead. ""Word of mouth"" is a very powerful tool for consumers to alert others of inferior and defective products!"
3,Great unit... while it worked,"Purchased the mouse for work and used it daily at my desk with an HP notebook. It was very easy to connect and worked flawlessly for about 5 months until summer started and the laptop started getting packed up and hauled to the lakes. After a couple of weekends, the receiver began to act up and wouldn't connect unless it was rotated to 90 degrees.It's now 3 months (and a few more weekends of travel) later and the receiver won't connect at any angle - even after attempting to manually connect using the ""connect"" button on the bottom of the mouse.Except for the fact that this one's now a stylish paperweight, I preferred working with the mouse instead of the notebook's touchpad. I'll probably break down and buy another as it beats swiping at a touchpad. I just hope the second one has a longer life expectancy."
2,It broke!,"This was my second cordless optical mouse I purchased for my laptop after the wheel broke on my first. After about 2 months, my laptop stopped recognizing the usb device and then the usb stopped communicating with the mouse alltogether. Hoping it was still under warranty, I attempted to contact Microsoft tech support, but they didn't seem to recognize the number of my product. I now have a new logitech mouse that works fine that was about the same price, but a much better value. I would not purchase this mouse."
1,Stopped working after 2 months,My mouse stoppped working after 2 months. Very poor deisgn for the USB attachment. It sticks outside the notebook and by mistake if you tilt the notebook it damages the reciever.
2,"Just ok, there are much better ones now","I got this one as my first wireless mouse. Now that I have three, all of them microsoft, this one gets the lowest grade, and is basically outdated.Yeah, it works as a wireless mouse, but it has some incurable issues:1. the USB transmitter is HUGE. new mice now have the low-profile transmitters that stick out about a 1/2 inch from the surface. this one is around 1.5 inches long (guess), and I worry that if I hit it, I'm going to break something off.2. there are no side buttons on the mouse. I'm so used to them now to go back/forward when I'm on a browser, that this one aggravates me when I have to use it.It's now relegated to my second-team office computer used by my sometimes help. pass on this one unless it's practically free...."
2,Good and obvious; but failed after two years,"This is a fairly solidly built mouse; and is rather intuitive and obvious to use. It has two buttons and a scroll wheel. Plug the snap-in receiver and start using the mouse straight away. Battery life is also good; with daily use a single AA cell lasts between 6-10 months.However... a measure of the quality of the device has to be also based on longevity. Two years after purchasing this mouse, one fine morning its left-click button stopped working. I tried turning off and back on the mouse, changed the battery, gave it a rest and tried again, dusting the mouse to remove any dust or particles that may have found its way in. To no avail. The button has simply stopped working. Two years is pitifully less. I have mice from the 1990s that still work. So this is fairly disappointing.This may well be a one-off, but that is little consolation. I expected better reliability and build quality."
4,Works great.,Works great for me. The battery life is good if you remember to insert the transmitter in the back when it is not in use. After several months of use I did sometimes experience a bit of a problem with the battery connection. Every now and then it would stop working and I would have to remove the battery cover and gently push on the battery to make a good connection. All in all I highly recommend this mouse.
3,works but feels flimsy,"this mouse works just fine but it has a very insubstantial feel...one bump and it will fall into a million pieces, I fear. On the other hand, it is very light, so if one is traveling with it, the mouse won't add much to the total weight."
3,MS Mouse,"The mouse may be too sensitive. When using on screens that can move if you click and hold, it pulls the screen when you're just trying to click."
4,Good Notebook Mouse Purchase,"Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase. The only thing is that I hope that the battery doesn't wear out too early even if I take the USB adaptor out of my computer."
2,it was ok until it broke,I bought it in April 2009 and it broke in January of this year.. I bought it to replace a logitech which I lost :( The logitech had worked great.. this one was alright except it was kind of temperamental.. it didn't work quite as well as my logitech and now it doesn't work at all soo... I don't recommend it.
1,My 2d mouse broke within a year of use,"I do not recommend this mouse. After less than 1 year of use, the USB part does not work anymore (the reason is that the connection is loose). I liked the mouse and bought another one - the same happens in less than 4 months. I think it is a bad product and I will never buy it again."
2,Bad design,"This mouse, while cute and easy to carry, has a huge design flaw. The USB plug is hinged, and in no time at all, mine stopped working. (The design has improved since then -- a USB plug that snaps into the bottom of the mouse is very convenient, but just make sure it is one straight, solid piece, with no hinges or moving parts.) The USB plug started losing the connection sporadically within six months of my purchase and in less than a year it had failed completely. It has a three-year warranty, so I called Microsoft and they are refunding my money."
1,NOT Good Long Term,"I have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken. The ""L"" shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem. I will call it a receiver. It you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break. Over time the receiver doesn't receive.I would not recommend this product. It's better to have a straight receiver."
3,High-Pitched Noise,"It emits a faint but high-pitched noise from notebook (not the mouse itself) when mouse receiver is connected. It will drive you nuts if you work in a quiet room. Other than that, everything works well."
1,Only works within 12 inches,Very disappointed in this mouse as it only works when the mouse is within 12-16 inches of the USB adapter. Bought is on sale for $13.99 but overall it was a waste as I am constantly moving it to get it in range. Went back to wired mouse after a month of frustration. I don't know about other alternatives but anything would be better than this thing.
2,Design Flaws,"After a few months of use, the left click became intermittent, probably some dust problem, because after cleaning with cleaning fluid it worked again ... for a while. Also the battery mounting is a poor design. The contact spring is at the wrong end (Pos. side), toy designers know better. Occasionally I have to bang the mouse because of intermittent contact."
4,Great product,"The product came with a tiny scratch on the lower left part of the mouse. I noticed it already while it is still inside the packaging. The plastic part of the packaging has some tiny damage on the portion. Something hard must have caused this. That is why I rated the packaging 2 stars. I think if the product is not too close to the plastic packaging and there is some sort of protective material that would cushion the product a little bump like this would be avoided. It's too tiny that returning it and waiting for another one is not worth it for me.Other than that, it is great and works really well. Really plug and play. I did not even read the documentation. I simply put it on my USB and started using it.As a traveler, I would like to have something smaller and the USB to be smaller too as I see from it's competition. But all's all right."
4,"It's Ok, but nothing special","I got this because I needed a wireless mouse and it was on sale. Apparently the color Aloe Green isn't too popular, so I got it at a good price. I do have trouble with it occasionally, but not consistently, so I put up with it. Sometimes the receiver starts blinking at about 1 second intervals. When that happens the mouse response is erratic. After about a minute I get a solid green on the receiver and the mouse responds normally. Then five minutes later the whole scenario repeats. This seems to happen only when I'm in particular locations in the house, so I don't know if there's electrical interference causing the problem. When it's working I like it. However, I have had it less than a month and I already had to change the battery. I think I'll start using rechargeables in it."
2,MICROSOFT WIRELESS NOTEBOOK MOUSE,"Decent price, although I am sure a percentage is INCLUDED for MR BILL GATES and the REDMOND conglomerate. Does the job, but if you are not going to use the MOUSE for a while, make sure to disconnect the battery...ALSO it DOES take up 1 of your precious USB ports"
1,have not received the itrem,I can't review the item because I never receive it!!!!!!! I will rate it when and if I get it!
3,Very Small,"I like the 5000 better. This one is very, very small and requires you to plug in a receiver to the usb port. The 500 is larger and no plug-in receiver is needed."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product, my other mouse had a small cord so I got this mouse to replace it and I think this mouse works way better than my old one did. This wireless mouse works perfect, no more cords being pulled on! To my surprise it came with a battery, that was easy to put in."
2,Great... when it works...,"I imagine this would be a decent mouse for someone on a flight or when their mouse will be no more than 2 feet (3 feet is a gross over estimate) from the USB dongle. Over 2 feet things get quirky. Unless you are on a full battery your mouse may not respond to clicks and may lag. It doesn't help that it takes about a week from installing a new battery to get to this point. The sides of the mouse also wear down easily and the cheap rubber starts to peel away after about a month of use. Not a pretty sight. The dongle is also one of the larger ones on the market and will cause your mouse to act up if anything brushes up against it.If you want a cheap wireless mouse for a trip or as a temporary solution, then I'd say go for it. But if you want a long term, reliable mouse for office use, then I recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Already been through two,I originally bought one and liked it. It was relatively inexpensive and did its job. After that one broke for no reason I decided i would but the same one again. BIG MISTAKE. The second one broke too and I dont intend to buy another microsoft mouse ever again.Negatives:If you even touch the usb connector it starts blinking signaling you disrupted the connection and you now need to take it out and put it back it which is annoying.The mouse stays on all the time. I see the red glow from the bottom when im laying in bed.It makes a small beep noise every time you use it. The beep is very low but if you have no music on or anything and are sitting in silence you can definitely hear it a little bit.
5,pretty,"I purchased this last month because my old mouse had broke. It works really well. It is very smooth to work with and battery life is good. The color of the mouse is so pretty and matches my laptop perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone needing a new, pretty colored mouse. It works well and is very affordable. It shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. Even the included batteries worked well."
4,these work great,"This is my third (and fourth) purchase of this product. One of the really nice features of this mouse is the ability to store the flash drive in the bottom of the mouse when not in use. The range is good, too. I have not had to replace any batteries yet and I have been using one of these for over a year. I use one with my desktop and one on my laptop. The two I bought this time were gifts. Both recipients are very pleased with the performance."
3,Don't bother with this item,"I thought this product would be a decent one because of the brand name. As a whole, the product worked ok but the receiver is so flimsy. Because the receiver sticks out about 2"", I think it would work best with a PC...not a laptop. I returned it and bought a wireless mouse that has a receiver which sticks out only about 1/4""."
3,I dropped it :(,"It worked so good, and i loved it so much. then i dropped it. now it wont do anything. i dont know if a more expensive one would have helped, but i'm gonna buy a different brand."
2,Turned out to be not so good product...,"Glad that I didn't give my reviews before because I was initially very satisfied with this mouse. Nice design, color, and relatively long range considering its price was impressive. But after 6 months, it started to fail. Became very irresponsive to left-clicking. I haven't experience such a problem with any mouse I used before. And only in 6 months... Now I need to find another one."
2,"When it works, it's great; however . . .","The mouse worked fine for a couple of months, then it started to go bad. Sometimes it works, other times it'll balk. It always balk when I'm doing something important. I'd have to pull out and reinsert the USB receiver several times to get it to work again. I've changed the battery several times so that's not the problem. Since I was getting frustrated with it, I went back to using a wired mouse."
1,I worked for 3 days and then failed,I worked for 3 days and then failed. Please let me know how do I return this item.
1,Nothing for a price,"Hello I am not happy with this mouse, because I have not received yet, I placed the order on February 4th, today is March 8th, and nothing happen. The charge it was applied on my credit card, but I have not received the good.....Someone can help me about this matter????"
2,lousy microsoft mouse,this mouse stopped working after 2-3 months. Even with fresh batteries it won't connect with its USB dongle. The reduced price was not worth the irritation.
1,Poor wireless signal,"I used for several months with not very good pointing. Then the mouse continue to point slowly and incorrectly. Finally I found it was too far away from the USB receiver. But actually I always put the mouse within the length of a notebook. So I have to move closer to the receiver, you know how far does it start to work? right under the USB receiver!!! and it won't work even with a distance of a mouse. I have make sure the battery is fully charged."
3,Very short range,"For the most part, this has been a pretty good, pretty reliable mouse, but its range is extraordinarily short. I'm two feet away from my computer and it barely reads it, and I have to reset it over and over but it doesn't make any difference. It's become very frustrating at times."
4,Great wireless mouse- best I've used so far.,"This little mouse is awesome! Took it out of the box, popped the USB receiver in my laptop and it was ready to go- worked flawlessly. The receiver snaps onto the back of the mouse so it's very easy to travel without worrying about losing it. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it does not have a power button and I am worried it's going to drain the battery when I am not using it. Of course, I could take the receiver out of the computer but then that does not seem very practical and defies the whole purpose of a wireless mouse. I would have liked it to have some kind of a button to shut the mouse off when not in use. Other than that, it's great."
2,do not order from this vendor,"When I ordered this product it was in stock but took nine days to arrive. I should have gone to the store and purchased it rather then paying $4.99 for shipping. The vendor apologized and told me that if I removed my negative feedback, they would refund my shipping costs. Well, they did not keep their promise and I did not get a refund. I would not order from this vendor again."
1,The mouse died in 2 weeks,The mouse started off working great and within 2 weeks the mouse died. What a rip off!
3,"Works pretty well, but range not that good","This is only my second wireless mouse. While this one is better than the $10 cheapy I bought before, it still isn't as good as I hoped it would be based on the glowing reviews I read before buying. The main issue is that sometimes (often) it loses the signal to the computer (blinking red light), and often with no obstruction and very little space in between the reciever and mouse. A little annoying when you are trying to get work done :("
3,Terrible battery consumption and bulit quality,"I bought it at $10 deal. Everything work great after a month. The battery cover locking latch broke after a month but it can easily to glue back. Microsoft states the battery can last at least six months but mine only last for a month in continuous use. In considering for $10, I can accept the defect. I would not recommend this mouse if over $10 by its quality."
4,Good but small range,This mouse is great the only problem is that the range is too weak and I wish it could go further. Just that is bad about it I think but the rest is perfect
2,"For a Little More Money, Buy a Better Mouse","I bought this mouse because it is under $20. The appearance and the color of the mouse are nice, but it does not work very well. The click sound is kind of noisy. What's worse is the scroll wheel. It makes a loud noise when it scrolls up. It is not as bad when I [scroll down].The mouse is very precise when it comes to moving around the page. You have to refocus your spot several times before it can locate the exact spot you are getting at. Comparing with the other Logitech notebook mouse I have, the Microsoft mouse is more poorly made. The USB transmitter is too long and does not fit on to the mouse nicely. The worst part of all is that it does not work even on a flat desk surface. I had to use a notebook as a mouse pad for it to function.My recommendation is to spend a little more money and get a better mouse. You will regret if you get this one."
2,Great at first - Then not so good.,I bought this mouse about 6 - 8 months ago. I use this mouse 5 hours plus a day.Pros:Works great for the first few months!Fits your hand well.Cons:Uses a ton of AA's! Like 6 to 12 AA's in the last 8 months!!The outside Gell/smooth outside started to rub away after 4 months! Now its almost all the way through the outside.After 8 months the mouse is shot. Its lagging and Time to buy a new mouse.
5,Cordless mouse,I think I have already reviewed this product--maybe twice. But I have not changed my mind. I received excellent service and the mouse was satisfactory
4,Great Product,"I use this product every day. I use it with a graphics software program and it works great. I replace the battery every 3-4 months. This is my second mouse of this model, the first one lasted about a 1 1/2 years of continuous use."
5,Wireless Mouse Works Great!,"Ordered the mouse, was able to change the type of shippping since I was traveling to another state. Came in the allotted time. Would recommend seller to anyone. Thanks!"
3,"Good mouse,but dzn't hv a good range","if u try to use it over 6 feet, it would not work at all....sigh..."
5,Wonderful product!!,"This wireless mouse is perfect!!! It is just the right size for my small hands, works very well and I love that you can store the transmitter (hope that's what it's called!)underneath the mouse. Great product, I will be ordering another one for my desktop soon."
5,Mouse,I am on my 3rd laptop and this is the first time I have used a mouse. I absolutely love having this mouse. It fits nicely in my hand and is extremely comfortable. Very easy to use and very accurate. There is nothing better than being wireless ever. I like the fact that the unit that plugs into the computer fits in the bottom of the mouse so that if you travel you always have it with you and don't forget it. I am so glad I purchased this one.Karen Dowd
1,Microsoft Wireless Mouse 3000,"I have used a Logitech mouse with my laptop previously. They have been great. I didn't think the Microsoft one would be much different. It was a big disappointment. The scroll wheel is so stiff and jerky, I don't even use it. I had left a comment about my issues with it and received no response. Will not buy this brand again."
2,Very limited range,"The mouse has a very limited range of less than 3 feet, which is indicated on the packaging. Unfortunately, I could not find that information in the description on Amazon. I'm sure that I will find some use for it-- just not the one that I had originally intended."
5,This Mouse Rocks!!,"I ordered this mouse to replace one just like it. The one I'm replacing is 5 years old, the only reason I am replacing it is because I just purchased a new laptop and wanted a new mouse to go with it. The old mouse is still going strong and I use it every day."
4,Wireless Mouse - way to go,"Easy to use, no wire to fuss with, have to change batteries from time to time, but it's worth it. Can easily use with multiple PCs."
4,Good mouse,"I've been using this mouse for about a month now, and it's good. The only problem that I see is forgetting to put the usb drive into the mouse to save power. Another issue that I noticed is the mouse sometimes freezes if its too far away from the computer. My laptop's usb port is on the left, while the mouse is on the right(right handed). But please don't see this as a serious problem, cause it isn't. It has only froze about twice since I have had it. I would definately recommend this product for those who are tired of mouse cords!"
4,Very comfortable,"I actually got this for my Mom and she loves it! I've used it a few times and it feels really nice, but is a little small for my hand and doesn't provide enough palm support over long gaming sessions. Also, the wireless makes it seem a little less responsive, but I'm used to the Logitech G5 and other gaming mice that sell for 3x this amount and aren't nearly as portable."
5,Simply Convenient,"Once you put your AA battery in the mouse, plug in the USB and about 15 seconds later the mouse will work perfectly. Very simple, gets the job done, and made by Microsoft so there is no worries about compatability... Unless you have a mac. Can't beat the price, espeacially with how it will just simply work."
4,Good mouse for a laptop,I bought this mouse for a new Vista laptop. It was probably the easiest mouse I've ever installed. I've also used it with my XP work laptop and intallation is no problem even if you don't have administration rights.The only negative is that the mouse may be a little small if you have large hands. I do recommend this device.
2,Not all that responsive,"I've had this mouse for 3 months now and ever since the purchase it lags consistently. I have the bluetooth dongle about 2ft from the mouse at all times and have replaced the battery twice. After a while, the signal will be restored and it'll work fine but will sporadically lag. Also, it takes several clicks on a link before it will respond. Not a very good product."
4,Worked Great!,"Had this mouse for about 9 months- worked great! Then one day it didn't want to work all the time- sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't. A bit on the small side- which was fine with me as I have small hands; some of my guy friends that had larger hands found it to a bit awkward when using it."
5,Mouseriffic,"Right size, right price, and works very well. Would buy another if I had another laptop."
5,so far so good,Bought this together when I purchased Sony Vaio laptop in Amazon. The price was $19.90 and it's still cost the same. I replaced the battery once after 3 months of using it and now 3 months later the battery still works fine. The sensitivity is good and I like the size and the shape of this mouse because you can rest your fingers comfortably. The scrolls is good too.
4,Microsoft Wireless Notebook Mouse 3000,"Product works as advertised, no set up required.Comfortable to hand.Bought a second one for my work laptop."
4,Great product,"Product works great, fits nicely in my hand, but I do have small hands. Battery life not that long though. Otherwise worth the money."
5,A good mouse for people on the go,"I've had mine for a couple of weeks now, and I can't imagine using a mouse with a cord ever again. I've always had perfect signal, and I've always had optical quality precision.It may not be the best choice for a desktop machine, but for a laptop... I won't be using anything else for a while."
1,it's BAD,"I found myself stuck after buying Avant's first album. While I enjoyed some of the songs, the album seemed to be up and down. The second album was roughly the same. Avant had a nice voice that would work great on quality up tempo r&b; songs (much like TQ) but lyrically... most of the stuff he sings is trash (much like TQ post Never Saw Me Coming). However, there were enough good songs on Avant's albums that I decided I would take the risk and give his third album a try. BIG MISTAKE.After several playthroughs of the album, I found I could hardly remember any of the songs. Not because I have alzheimers, but because most of the songs are bland. The entire album seems to be filler track after filler track. The only track of any exception here is Wanna Be Close which I LOVE. If you can, just get that song because the album is definitely not worth its admission price."
3,Extremely MOR,"Avant - Private Room (Geffen, 2003)Any talk about Avant being a microwaved version of R. Kelly probably won't stop with this album. There are some tolerable ballads to get the mood right like ""Read Your Mind"" and one song I actually do like is ""Wanna Be Close"". But there is still filler to be found like ""Have Some Fun"" and the lackluster duet with Olivia, ""Seems to Be"" (where's Keke Wyatt when you need her?). To tell you the truth, there aren't many good songs on here at all, mainly due to the R. Kelly-stenciled lyrics. I'm not too sure if Avant will be remembered ten years from now because unlike Kelly, he has no real identity: any of these songs could be sung by anybody and they would sound the same. If you're looking for good background music for you and your mate, here you go. Otherwise, if you don't have V.I.P., you wouldn't want to enter this Private Room, anyway. -EJR"
3,Liked album but the Steve Huff sound's running out of steam,"Avant's third album is good, but some of the songs lack the punch of his other two. The Steve Huff signature sound, where Huff produced entire albums for Avant, is running out of steam. The songs are becoming monotonous with some of that same thump-thump-thump sound. Some of the ballads are becoming blander. Avant needs to find some other producers, musicians and writers to do his next one. Luckily, his upcoming album in January of 2006 has some new people on it and the aformentioned Huff."
2,...,i really wanted to get into this cd and i find.. just ughhh. I love avant and he could do better... just another cd to shelf until i get up the patience to try to hear it again. :(
3,Good Effort...,"I LOVED Avant's debut album, but his sophomore effort SUCKED! But I couldn't give up on my boy. I purchased his new album and listened with my eyes closed and ears wide open and wasn't as disappointed as I was at his last album but it still isn't as good as his first...""Read your mind"" is sexy. ""Phone sex"" is a good listen as well...if you're a true fan cop it. If you're new to Avant, don't judge him on this album alone. Listen to ""My Thoughts"" first to know where I'm coming from..."
1,JR High R.Kelly,"Avant might have a Catchy Song somewhere in His Basic material.the Cat is alright Singer but can't write no songs&Seems like He is stuck in what the ARUH was doing a Decade ago that was far better than anything that Avant could ever dream to Create.Avant is been studying R.Kelly in terms of Pattern Himself after Him but Avant is missing the Key Goods:the Songs,Voice&Overall Presentation.Avant is Flunking R.Kelly Class 101 Badly.Avant is also Flunking at trying to tap into Joe circa 99-00 as well."
4,Tiger?,"I don't know where they came up with the tiger anaology, seems gimicky to me. All in all it was a fairly good book that delieneated how the air war was develolped and excecuted."
2,Clancy or Horner?,"Reading the book I couldn't help wondering who - in reality - wrote it: Clancy or Gen Chuck Horner. The book cover states ""By Tom Clancy"" in capitals and adds in very small print ""with Gn. Horner"". To any reader it is obvious it should be the other way around. Unfortunately, the last page of the book amplifies the overstatement of Mr clancy's role: a picture of Gen.Horner standing next to Mr Clancy, who, judging by his attire, likes to leave the impression that he was ""there"" himself, either aloft or as the personal advisor of Gen. Horner. From his resume I infer however, that he never even served in the military?"
1,A terrific text book for an Air Force Operations Manual,"The story of Gen. Horner is interesting. As for the rest of this book, which is the majority, should be saved for one of his Modern Air Force Operations Manuals."
2,A good book about a soldier by an arrogant jerk,"This is a good book by an unfortunately arrogant jerk who has patted himself on the back to many times about being a so called ""military expert"". I have met Mr. Clancy when I was stationed in the Navy in Groton, CT. When I met Mr. Clancy he was to busy spouting off who he knew in the Government to someone in the line. Then he gave me a come hither look when he signed the book ""Sum of All Fears"" and just as arrogantly didn't say anything when I complimented him on his works. This is NOT the ONLY TIME he has done this to people but has done this many times to his fans. Yes he is a good author but unfortunately when you meet him you meet a pompous self righteous know it all who is not the voice of the US Navy, but just another lucky author who was graced with good timing and good publishers."
3,Slapping Yourself on the Back,"Clancy has made a minor industry out of telling the military about itself in the most glowing terms. In this book he does it again, but at least in the title he's honest and up front about it. If this ""we love ourselves"" fest got any less critical we'd be putting Horner in for pontification. If you're not interested in reading the whole unvarnished anything, read this book."
2,Clancy insulted the Air Force,"When Tom Clancy visited Space Command for a photo op for this book, he ran into an Airman who WAS a huge Clancy fan. The Airman had read most of Clancy's books. Clancy basically made a comment like ""you don't want me here, and I don't want to be here so lets just get this thing over with"". Image is not always reality when you meet a star."
4,A Warrior's Unique Story,"The best part of Every Man a Tiger is the compelling voice of General Horner revealing the inside story of a revolutionary air campaign as it unfolded. General Horner, the man, the tiger, allows the reader to climb inside his head as he choreographs the human aspect of critical air operations while managing a multi-national coalition, freely admitting that the burden of failure rested with him. Indeed, destiny put the right man at the right place at the right time. All his prior training, assignments, and experiences in Vietnam and the Middle East coalesced during Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In future conflicts, we will need tough, compassionate, selfless, military leaders like Chuck Horner if we are to overcome the daunting challenges that lay ahead. Read it."
2,Tom Clancy should stay away from biographies & the NFL,"It was bad enough when Jack Ryan was replaced by John Kelly, certainly is was worse when the NF and Tom Clancy did not team up, however, the worst was this biography. General Horner may have been brillant as a fighter pilot and a commander, but his biography is pretty boring. I say this an old ""brown shoe"" navy man who flew in the same era as when Horner was a young lieutenant. I can not comprehend how any one with little or no military training could even pick this tome up. Too long, too technical and a little too self agrondizing."
4,Puts the rubber onto the road (into the air).,"If you are looking for a Jack Ryan techno-adventure, this ain't for you, bucko. Other reviewers seem to have failed to look at what they bought. Like Clancy's book with Fred Franks about the US Army, this one looks at the 20 years during which the US Air Force stumbled out of Viet Nam and re-created itself into a winning military force. Yeah, Iraq wasn't the Soviet Union, but they used their weapons and, most importantly, their tactics. This behind the scenes look shows that what George Marshall said 60 years ago is still true, ""The plan is nothing - planning is everything."" This book peers into the plans, means, and methods of modern air war. Read it with that in mind, not Jack Ryan, and you'll be glad you did."
3,Evocative,"Portrait of young woman trying independence. The heroine has many good attributes, including fierce loyalty and extreme warmth towards other characters. It's unusual for a book of this type, told in first person with a female protagonist, to have been written by a man, and a young man at that. The English seaside seems to hold an almost mythic importance for British writers. This book and the Electric Michelangelo both take place in seaside towns, the combination of hope and decrepitude, almost a metaphor for unfulfilled wishes. Also, this book is raw with vivid descriptions of sex. Instead of being gratuitous, they enhance the characterizations."
3,Surprisingly Good,"Similar to ""Wounded"", but much, much better. Harry Hamlin is suitably creepy but not overdone, and Madchen Amick's character possesses a brain and actually uses it, a rarity in the woman-chased-by-psychopath genre. The acting is fine(especially by Amick), and while the story has some obvious holes and stupid points, it's entertaining overall."
3,Basically a collection of various...,...word puzzles based on science topics...interesting but unforunately not coordinated with any particular textbook...and unless you're willing to sit down and try to figure out how align each puzzle with each topic in your particular curriculum then it's probably not going to be very useful...possibly useful as a resource for supplementary review type materials.
3,"Well, at least this Star Trek book makes sense!","This book, although not a great literary work, was a relief to read. It is presently the only book standing between me and a sweeping condemnation of ALL Star Trek books.The story is interesting and even engrossing. Each chapter ends with a little cliff hanger, and (most important) it keeps in continuity with the television series. It is a good follow-up story to the episode ""Errand of Mercy,"" but is it guilty of the same annoying flaw as the original series and most Star Trek books - way too much focus on Kirk and Spock.I give this book four stars for the story and continuity, and I take back one star for the reason stated. (Am I the only Trekkie who feels this way about the original Star Trek?)"
3,The original novel based on Star Trek characters.,"Since this 1972 edition was printed, Star Trek novels have undergone a total reformation in style, length, and subject matter. Spock Must Die! deals with a very specific theme (obviously) and is written to appeal to the fans of the late 1960's.The novel is a must read for any Star Trek fan. It is what inspired so many authors to pursue their writing dreams. Many of whom wrote their own novels based on the Star Trek characters."
4,Will The Replicated Spock Please Identify Yourself,I return to Star Trek- so I can get my head right in the real world. When will we all transcend like the Organians?
3,First one published and it shows,"It's a short read and if you can find it at a used book store, like I did, you should pick it up. You really need to read this as if it were set in an alternate universe, mostly because of how it ends.It's wasn't poorly written but I wouldn't say it was greatly written either. It was just sort of, eh, writing. It assumed you knew the characters, the ship, and the universe you were reading about. I didn't find anything speculatively wrong with it, it held my interesting for 118 pages, but if it were a longer I'm not sure I'd feel the same.I think I read this was based on a script for the show and it shows in the writing. I could easily see this being adapted for the show and it would probably have been fun to watch."
3,Well....,"I cannot say I liked this book, but I cannot honestly say that I disliked it either. It's style and subject matter struck me as somewhat dated. It also has a bit more of ""science"" then most ST novels, at least recent ones. I think I would have enjoyed reading it more if it did not involve the StarTrek universe. I'd have to say that this book is for serious ST fans only."
2,Excellent Concept ... and Nothing More,"If you enjoy wasting your time, pick up this book. Blish takes a pretty cool concept and then methodically whisks and purees the soul from the Trek characters and lore until we're left with a colorless sketch that seems designed merely to show off the author's ready access to engineering dictionaries.The original characters simply did not speak the way Blish writes them: everyone gets a lengthy, wandering monologue filled with multisyllabic, techno-jumble.Blish's representation of Scotty's brogue is outright incomprehensible. I kept thinking, This is supposed to be Scotty, not Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons. (I expected to ""hear"" Scotty call Bones a ""croquet playing mint muncher"" or something.)The best thing I can say about this book is that it is blissfully (Blish-fully?) short."
1,A terrible book,It's poorly written book. The stuff in this book absolutely does not make sense.How can any mormal people develop technology that can trap powerful entities? How can a tranporter duplicate happen?
3,Not my favorite of Manny,"This third album is where Manny was clearly trying to do something different and more varied. Only the first half consists of merengues, and they somehow lack the sparkle of his other albums. Manny's singing is just not as good, and neither the arrangments nor the background vocals as creatively done. The only song I like a lot is the arresting Se que me eganaste un dia.In the second half of the CD, merengue is tossed aside and we go into a series of really strange pop songs. Kind of interesting, but this is really not the kind of material that showcases Manny Manuel's talents. Some of the songs sound a little like that got lost on the way to a Julio Iglesias album.Still, this album has been well received, and certainly represents a substantial effort, but compared to Lleno de Vida, Autentico and even Rey De Corazones, this is really less exciting."
2,"another over-rated shoegazer ""classic""","this is an ok album, typical ambient reverby guitar throughout with classics like pearl and april but to be honest it sounds seriously dated.i could never understand why they put a crap ambient mix of ""something more"" on it instead of the far superior original. some of you shoegazer reviewers need to get with the times! the reason loveless is still so popular is because it still sounds modern unlike most of the other shoegazer bands.still, not a bad effort."
2,daz lost his touch,i used to think daz was one of the best rappers in the game but in the last few albums hes lost that dpg laid back flow that goes with the LBC .........its just not good
1,"not the normal daz, weak","Definitely not living up to what daz is capable of, he needs to put alot of work and time into one solid album, don't just realease everything u have. I think that the real daz is still there but i'm not seein him in this weak album, there's a small handful of tracks that r alright, but i'm not feeling the rest. I wouldn't recommend this album, but in support of Daz cause i'm a big fan, go pick up Revenge, Retaliation, and Get Back. That album is the real D-A-Z. You can tell that he put some time into that album, which is what he needs to do."
4,An act of Vader,"Vader is a Metal band that blends Thrash and Death Metal with Slayer as the general ancestor. Vader appears more technically refined and more powerful fresh with neurotic Flavour.The very fast use of chords is lead under an assimilation of chaos. Production is clear making the music extremely powerful.Once the listener falls into the layer of Vader it will seems intoxicating. Most impressive is the precision and accuracy of the riffs creating a very natural balance in the complex compositions. Standouts are Silent Empire, Blood of Kingu and Incarnation."
2,MADONNA IS NOT FEATURED LIARS,ITS ALBUM THAT DOES NOT FEATURE MADONNAI BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I WAS FOOLED BY THE FALSE ADVERTISEMENTHOWEVER; ITS VERY 80'S UNDERGROUND POP-DANCE I SUPPOSEBUT DONT BUY IT IF YOU WANNA HEAR MOTHER SINGCAUSE SHE WONT.
5,"mainly for fans, but 80s nuts will also like it","Remixes and rare tracks make up this set. As a long time Naked Eyes fan it was great to hear some of these remixes, Arthur Baker really had a knack back then. The Jellybean stuff is less memorable, I can see why they got shelved. And Madonna's contribution is fleeting.The tracks from the pre-Naked Eyes days, Neon, are really great. they have that classic 81 sound."
4,Good remixes and a special guest star,"This collection of remixes gives a new light to some songs by Naked Eyes. The most famous 80's success ""(What)In the name of love"" has a new sound but it keeps all the magic of those powerful decade. Besides, one of these remixes, called ""Promises Promises"" has a special guest star singing some verses. Who is she? Simply Madonna"
3,Iroquois cannibalism uncovered,"The reason this book is important for me it's that for the first time I met the description of Iroquois cannibalism. Being interested since childhood in american indians' customs I was amazed about the creeping censorship that never allowed me to be aware of this fact that I consired purely ""ethnological"" without ethic implication. I looked for other evidences in books and in the net and found them with many difficulties. It seems that ritual cannibalism of one's ancestors is politically uncorrect."
3,Missing page 29,"Order 1, it was missing page 29. Returned it and was shipped another and it was missing page 29. I didn't read farther than that so I don't know much about the book."
4,"Gripping and fascinating, but explicit","This is a fascinating and gripping portrait of a Jesuit priest on a journey to a Huron mission in New France. Moore does well in contrasting the alien cultures of the Algonkin and the French. Both sets of values are taken seriously, and ultimately it is sacrificial love that offers hope that the cultural chasm can be bridged. While the Jesuit's journey does challenge his faith, it does not destroy it. Please note that this book does contain explicit sexual scenes and foul language. The sex scenes are not meant to titillate but to develop moral and cultural conflicts, and the foul language is used because that is how the Algonkin talked. This book would not be appropriate for high school libraries."
4,Legend of Blown up Master...,"If you want to make a movie about a sword-wielding super ninja avenging his master you probably don't want to start the movie by having the aforementioned sword-wielding super ninja rescue his master and then blow him up. Nonetheless this is the road that Saviour of the Soul chooses to take and it is pretty succesful. The movie is just plain fun and extreme. It does just about everything there is in the filmmaker's handbook to get the audience to laugh, cry, and cheer. I really don't get the plot...that's where the holes are, but if you ignore plot entirely and follow the story without questioning any of the massive gaps in its logic, then you will enjoy this flick. Great art direction, sweet Hong Kong style fight scenes and a quality Superman take-off definetly make this dvd worth buying. Oh yeah, it also has Cantopop...nothing but Cantopop for a soundtrack...oh boy."
3,Style over Substance,"The MTV, jumpcut style, of action in the opening prison breakin, the later fight in the bathroom, and the warehouse fight (with the mirror gag) is first rate. Nobody does it better. The plot is melodramatic without earning it and the stylized look is extremely gooey. Post modern flash."
1,BEWARE!,"Picture on item doesn't match the picture here, and it is NOT a region 1 DVD. It will not play in American players."
4,Overall very decent,"Very durable, inexpensive and overall pretty good. They don't have the tendency to slip around if your fingers get a bit sweaty, unlike Dunlop Gels (although don't have too high expectations for this). Do note, however that they do come in ASSORTED colors. You may get ""good"" colors, you may not, but you're buying picks, not fashion items. Also, the smell out of the pouch seems highly carcinogenic, but that's ok."
4,Good picks,This are the first picks that doesnt broke in my hands. I can use each pick for a long time. Really happy
2,Sounded churchy,"This was much to churchy for me. I heard one of her songs on Pandora and was inspired to buy her album. However, I'm not into gospel music so I had a hard time enjoying it."
3,It's Ryoko,"This cd isn't great, but ain't bad if your fan of j-pop idols such has Utada Hikaru, Namie Amuro or Mai Kurkai give this cd a try. The tracks that really like and had a great beat were summer sunset (track 2)and Jeans (Track 3) I hope Ryoko has long successful career!!"
5,Flower Fairies of the Garden,My granddaughters who are 5 and 7 years are very intrigued with Fairies and their stories. They love the poetry in this whole series of books by Cicely Barker. I love reading these books with and to them. The illustrations are absolutely beautiful and inspire their imaginations.
1,Rip off,This price is a rip off. I added up the price to buy all the seasons separately from amazon.com and the total for seasons 1-9 was $239.91 that's more than $100 cheaper!!!
4,Deep Dark and glowing,"Amazing psychedelia from the blistering opening track to the closer..this album is amazing, and was correctly heralded when it came out. too bad for these guys that it all came to a close early on...still this album is pretty amazing in its guitar work and drenched psychedelic, acid musings..Great Melomania is not worth getting its a piss poor album full of partial sloppy tunes."
4,"Cute, fun, and girly","What I expected-- a cute, fun, and girly party collar for my 10 month old puppy. She doesn't mind wearing the collar and the rhinestone ends add sparkle. Some of the rhinestones have fallen off, but I expected that. Only a few, not enough to affect the overall look of the collar. Overall, a recommended buy to dress up your girl dog. Too girly for a boy dog."
4,Absolutely adorable or hysterical depending on how your pet reacts to it,"Very cute on cats, but the jingle bells kept one of mine trying to find where the bell sound was coming from ...due to the small size I was worried he would try to eat the bells. Make sure to watch your pets when they are wearing this as some may be able to figure out how to ingest the small bells."
1,NEVER AGAIN,"I purchased 2 small dog rhinestone collars, that could have been mailed in an envelope but instead were mailed in a huge box and I was charged $9+AND the collars were garbage. Within 3 days 7 rhinestones had fallen out of one of the collars. 3 DAYS!!!! And this on a little lap dog!!!! I will never EVER buy from KAKADU again."
4,Doggie's Fun Birthday Accessory,"When I saw this item on Amazon, I just knew it would be the perfect fun accessory for my dog, Suki, to wear on her birthday. I just love the way she looks while wearing it and it was just the right size. Suki isn't a huge fan of wearing apparel but she will consent to wear this collar if I bribe her with some of her favorite treats."
5,A terrific comeback effort,"This is great, greasy country soul -- the type of stuff that T. excels at. And the title song is one of the most touching, provocative numbers that T. has ever written. Welcome back, his T'ness."
4,Mischievous Mice!,"This is quite a funny tale about two frustrated thieving mice. In another one of Beatrix Potter's classics, animals are used to tell a charming tale, and instill a lesson at the same time.When Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca attempt to steal food, they are justly not rewarded with their desired prize. In the attempt they create much mischief and make a big mess. They end up paying the victims of the mess back in the end, indicating their sorrow over their troublesome deeds.A cute tale, that young animal lovers will enjoy.Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare.The Mischievous Hare"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"I read this interested in hearing the response of the articulate everyman to the pretentious literary establishment. I was disappointed first by the academic formality of Dale Peck's writing and then by the obscurity of his actual opinions. If you asked me after I finished reading a review ""so what's one thing he said was wrong with the book?"" I couldn't give you an answer.He never addresses the core fault of literature: that the writer's job is perceived not as selecting what to communicate, but, having made that selection, as presenting it with a series of thrusts and parries that alternatingly obscure and illuminate the scene they're depicting like a wavering torchlight. That is what is wrong with literature, and that is what is wrong with Dale Peck."
1,Must-Have,An astonishing book full of trenchant insights. Peck is setting a new standard for criticism of contemporary fiction.
1,Don't waste your time.,"A nasty, boring book in which someone whose talent appears to have sputtered out years ago, attempts to gain some notoriety by taking a hatchet to the work of others.As other reviewers have noted, Peck's preferred technique is to seek out the worst efforts of the author under 'review', line up a few cheap shots, and use this as an excuse to dismiss the author's entire body of work. The litany of denunciations does not appear to spring from any particularly coherent view of literature - it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the primary motivation is simple the author's own spleen, mixed in with resentment at the success of others. The cumulative effect of so much gratuitous nastiness is to make clear that Peck lacks the one essential quality needed to be an effective critic - that of discernment.Sour grapes much, Dale? At least Jonathan Franzen has some talent to back up his prickly public persona. With this author there's all the obnoxiousness and very little talent."
3,This is a cd that will surprise you.....,I have many cds by Mr. Wright. There are some of his cds that I really like and others I would like to forget. In this case I think he has a winner here.Danny choose good songs to record and gave an above average performance on most songs. I think this cd will be a people pleaser.Recommendation: I would urge solo piano fans to buy this cd.
3,cheap gel case for child's camera,"We bought a supposedly shockproof Olympus Stylus 720SW digital camera for our grandson's 4th birthday. This case is meant to add some protection. It was inexpensive, and seems to work. The negative is that you have to remove it (kind of a pain -- definitely not something our grandson can do himself) to charge the battery or access the USB port for uploading photos."
2,Minimally Helpful to Experienced Sellers,This book is minimally helpful to experienced sellers. More on the basics of eBay than specifically about crafts. Most of this information can be found in the Dummies books. I have read nearlly all eBay books written..this one goes to the bottom of the list.
5,"good item, very helpful...","THIS IS A GOOD STARTER BOOK, NEEDS A MORE UP TO DATE BOOK, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES ON EBAY SENCE THIS BOOK HAS CAME OUT."
4,excellent book,This book is a great addition to any fishermens collection. It shows you how to make all kinds for lures for everthing from bucktails to balsa plugs. If you like saving some money and doing stuff yourself then this is deffinantly the book for you.
3,It is just ok,Seems like a lot of the information is dated. I would not buy this book again. Just not enough valuable info. for me.
5,complete book of tackle making,"the best book of tackle making. It cover all aspect of making fishing gears for fisherman including sinkers, jig, rod building, lure or anything u can think on fishing. A must have for everybody."
5,Tackle Making With C. Boyd Pfeiffer,"I had no idea how much useful fishing equipment could be constructed until I read this book. If I taught a class on tackle making, this would be the course text. It would have been nice if there had been an illustration on how to use a wire-bender for making large pike spinners, but this is a very minor point. He covers everything from lure making to rod and net building. The book is very clearly written and illustrated. Almost everything related to each project is addressed. I recommend this book to fly fishers who feel disconnected when fishing with hardware. Making my own plugs, spoons, and spinners adds a greater degree of self-expression to spin fishing."
1,A yawner,"I read this book because I have an interest in the Balkans and was actually in Montenegro once. I made it all the way through the book, but was not impressed. The plot rambles and the various characters' motivations are often unclear. The characters are mostly one dimensional and formulaic -- the adventurous, handsome Englishman in an exotic foreign land, the evil Austrain captain, the fanatic Montenegrin freedom fighter (Danilo). At times I thought I was reading a romance novel. In sum, there are better ways to spend your time than reading this mediocre, plodding novel."
3,"Interesting to read, but more personal than political","I found this book to be more of an exploration of the feelings of the Englishman than of politics. It told me nothing that I didn't already know about the history of the area. I strongly recommend not reading the first chapter first; read the rest of the book, then go back and read the first chapter. The first chapter is essentially a summary of the whole book, and you will know what will happen and how it will end before you read the book itself."
4,John Allison,An excellent novel that deserved much more attention than it got. My rating of 4 probably would have been about 4.4 if finer increments were used.
1,Balkan Miasma,"This novel is most dissapointing. It is a rather dreary, depresing, and drawn-out story with little content, badly related to the story of the Balkan Wars and drastic changes that occurred in 1908 and soon after in the area the author describes. The pity is that Starling Lawrence certainly can write and doubtless did much research. What was needed here was to boil this slow-motion story down to about a quarter its length, add in much more relating to the overall historical events, add a little color and life to the story, and have things actually happen in the fitst 200 pages. I gained more knowledge of the Balkans from a single map in the Historical Atlas of East Central Europe than I did from this entire book."
3,Cheeseball but decent gift,"I bought this for Christmas as a present for a family member, who is in love with Nascar. It was a decent buy but the chips are made of plastic and it makes it a little cheesy - but what else would expect from the price? Decent gift for someone who isn't too serious about Poker and likes collectibles."
3,One for the small film die-hards only,This is a strange little art-house film that holds your attention simply because you have no idea just where it is going or why. I found the ending unnerving but oddly fitting. A surprisingly different role for James Spader to play and I am not sure he pulled it off in his usual competent way.
4,"Overall, well worth the time reading.","Before starting or continuing to embark on the pet care industry, read this book to cover all the basics. It saved me from making a few costly mistakes such as zoning and gave me new ideas in designing my kennel for expansion in the future. Also gave reference to suppliers (most are still in business). If you are looking for ideas that have worked for other kennels, this book will touch on such subjects as kennel design and what services to provide as well as how to display your ""quilt"" products. Also gives an example of a boarding contract. This book is endorsed by the ABKA and that was the first reason I purchased it."
2,A bit thin and oriented to the big end of the scale,"What I didn't realise when I ordered this is that it is an publication of a US kennel association. It is a slim book, gives a good, realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective, and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like ""is the kennel business for me?"" and ""what are the main issues in kennel management?"" Its orientation is toward large kennels (65+ dogs) in the US. For someone like me, who is thinking about a small kennel in Australia, it was interesting, but not really worth its pricetag."
2,works - eventualy,Coffee maker works perfectly but I wish I had known that it took so long to make coffee. Maybe this is true of all the 12 volts but I was surprised when I read on the box that it could take 30 min to brew a pot. But even more surprised when it took over an hour. I wanted this to use on our boat but I guess bringing a thermos is a better option
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I bought the coffee maker for camping at a remote site without hookups. I started the machine at 530am and 2 hours later it STILL NOT DONE!! It also killed one of the batteries in the 5th wheel, but thankfully we had a spare. I just sent the coffee maker back to Amazon............Thank you for easy returns!!!"
1,Wouldn't buy it again,"Takes way too long to brew a pot of coffee. Bought it for my husband's birthday to take on vacation because he loves his coffee all day and night. Thought we could brew a pot of coffee while sitting in the rest area having a bite to eat, but it never finished brewing. Another waste of money just sitting in the closet waiting to be sold at a garage sale for pennies on the dollar."
1,Junk,I never write reviews but had to with this thing. Complete junk and they know it. Cool idea but does not work. 45 minutes and not even a full cup. Who waits that long for coffee? Look for other options because you will 100% be wasting your money or giving someone a useless gift.
2,Pass on this one.,"I was warned that this coffee maker was slow. It is and it doesn't make a whole mug, mabe 8 ozs. We tried it and sent it back. Amazon took it back without a hassel. Yea of Amazon, they are the best."
5,great,the movie roots which ive enjoyed since i first viewed it on tv years ago is a very heart worming story and a part of history that we all need to sutdy
5,Satisfied!,Happy to have one the most captivating TV series on American tv in my collection. Product received as described by the seller.
5,Roots continued,I loved Roots and thought I would enjoy Roots: The Next Generation. Thanks for theopportunity. AA++++ seller
3,Roots: the next generation,"I received the set but instead of receiving Disc 4, Episode 7 I was given 2 of Disc #2 not allowing me to finish the series!"
3,it's okay don't really like the next generations,it's okay don't really like the next generations as much as i did the first roots with cunta kinte. cool.
1,Poor Experience,"I will be returning the product to Amazon. The cases in which the dvds were received in were bent and warped. It almost appears as if this was stored in a high humidity climate. Worst off, none of the discs are reading in my dvd player."
5,Blows The Mind&Very Essential,The Next Generation was Very Interesting especially During World War 1&2.also The Openess of HATE Was Reflected Upon ALex Haley's Return&Other Black Men who fought for this Country.Always Being Regarded as A Second-Class Citzen No Matter What Battle or Knowledge.The Lynchings&Killings are Hard Too View.ALex Haley Meeting&Talking With Malcolm X is Something SPecial.The Journey Continues as Does The Struggle but It's Important FOr America&The Whole World Too Better Understand it Before it Happens Again.
4,Good information,"Having this book around is like having a pediatrician available for answers to your questions. The information is helpful and useful, but like a conversation with your Doctor, rather dry and boring too. I use this one for ""health"" related issues, but when I want more lively, practical advice on discipline and behavior issues I turn to my other handbook: Perfect Parenting, The Dictionary of 1000 Parenting Tips because it has realistic ideas and is easy to read."
4,I reach for it regularly,"I purchased this book before my baby was born and have been ""reading ahead"" so I can be on the lookout for her next developmental milestones. So far, its given me ideas for toys and play and given me answers when I've noticed little things in her behavior or appearance and wondered if they were normal. Not repleat with pictures or humor, by any means, but organized in a way that easily educates the parent on the phases a baby progresses through. The index is helpful when you need the book as a reference."
4,"Dry Reading, But Good Reference","I wouldn't rate this book high for interesting presentation, but it is straightforward in giving information and it's easy to use as a reference. I wish it would have suggestions for things parents can try at home BEFORE calling the doctor, but I suppose that presents a liability issue. Otherwise, it's a good resource."
3,"Good information, but somewhat biased...","Overall, the book presents decent information, but I found it to be quite biased it its opinion of circumcision. The book states much misleading information on the topic and often quotes tragically outdated and long debunked myths and and as result suggests a strong preference to circumcision on part of the author. I would strongly suggest reading other books if one were inclined to research this issue further, particularly from an author with a less biased perspective."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this book as well as the what to expect series and i found that the What to Expect Series is much much more informative on the ""little"" things mom's and dad's need to know in a pinch. It goes in to much greater detail. I feel i wasted money on this book. I bought it when my first daughter was born 3 years ago and have used it twice. What To Expect whether it be first year, toddler years, etc. is much more informative.Now i have this book collecting dust.The what to expect books were cheaper too.That's my two cents."
2,Buy another book,"I do not like this book for the one fact that it does not break it down into age groups (1 mo, 2 mo, etc.) It groups a general age together and that's it. The index in the back is not that easy to read, it has to many different sub sections and other areas to check. I would recomend the book ""What to expect when you are expecting - the first year."" I got this as a gift, so I felt kind of inclined to use it, but only as a second opinion if I cannot find what I need in my other book."
2,"Not enough ""normal"" information","I bought this book hoping it would tell me month by month what to expect developmentally. It does do that, but the majority of the book is focused on diarrhea, sniffles, sneezes and other very specific ailments and disabilities. If I want to know about my child's ailments, I will call her pediatrician - not consult a book!"
5,Great baby shower gift,"I received this book as a gift when my son was born 3 years ago, and it has remained an invaluable tool for us. My favorite and most-used section is the dosage charts based on weight for Tylenol and Advil, a necessity when it's 11pm and baby has a fever. But half of the book is devoted to explaining the signs, symptoms, and treatments for many conditions. We refer to it constantly, and I gave it as a gift to my friend when she had her baby, and she constantly tells me that it was one of the best gifts she's ever received. I'm here today to buy another one for my sister...This is really bedside reading for any parent, and it's a great comfort and tool."
5,We never bought any other book once we got this book,"This book, given as a compliment by our Pediatrician on the first visit, we never even thought of buying any other book. Easy to read and refer. Very informative and helpful."
5,Definitely the best,"Being a new parent has it's anxieties. Therefore, I purchased a lot of books on parenting. I find this particular book very helpful in all aspects. It is the most comprehensive book on parenting that I've read so far. I'm glad I have this book to be my guide for my child's early years."
4,good info,I received this book as a free gift when I signed up to publix kids program since then I have boought copies and gave them away. It is a great refernce and is easy to use. My doctor also recommended it as a good resource tool. Another great book is By Sears Baby book. This is even better. Amazon has the best price.
4,A great reference!,"This book is a great reference tool. I'm definitely glad I purchased it. However it addresses a number of months at a time (ie, one chapter is dedicated to children ages 4-7 months). We all know how different a 4 month old is from a 7 month old, so if you are looking for a month by month guide, get ""What to Expect the First Year."" I own both books and consult them each for different things."
3,It Does the Job,"When I need to reference the book, ""it's there."" I am not shocked with it's ease of use but it's practical, comprehensive and recommended by my sister who is a pediatrician."
3,strong for the first year,"This book is great for the first year of life.After that, it tapers down A LOT in its' information, so I don't think it is necessarily a great title for the book ""from birth to age 5"", which is why I gave it 3 stars.It is a good reference book though."
2,Disorganized and Inconclusive,"I received this book free from 'Publix Baby Club' and was disappointed by its layout and language. I love to read and wanted to be sure I knew all that I could about infant care before I delivered my first child so I was eager to take all I could from this guide. Unfortunately the book jumped around and didn't seem organized, and therefore I was turned off to it. The content isn't as straightforward or as clear as it could be. If this is your only ""manual"" for infant and childcare, then by all means use it in stride. However, for a cleaner, clearer, concise and more conclusive book (in my own humble opinion), I'd recommend gettingWhat to Expect the First Year, Second Editionby Heidi Murkoff, Arlene Eisenberg, and Sandee Hathaway."
5,Perfect for first time moms!,"I'm halfway through my first pregnancy, and didn't have a clue as to what to expect when I bring the baby home. From what I've read so far (what to expect in the hospital, what to buy in preparation for the baby, what to expect when baby comes home, etc.), this book is already preparing me. There's so much I didn't know! Now I know what to expect, as well as when to immunize, when do babies start cutting teeth, when do I put baby in a high chair, etc. I knew NOTHING, but now I feel prepared. I really recommend this book!"
5,Fitness Motivator,"Reading ""Get Off Your Ass!"" by Marty Tuley is like having your own personal fitness trainer. He doesn't mince words; just ""tells it like it is."" No excuses, no make-believe. This is the hardcore truth. Marty is by turns your best friend (who will tell you the truth even if you're not sure you want to hear it), the man who sees into your heart, and a merciless drill instructor. Take this book home; take it to heart; it will change your life."
1,the most insulting book ever!,"This is the most disgusting, insulting book I have ever read. Not only is Marty Tuley completely prejudiced against anyone fat, if you go to his website and look at pictures of him and his fellow ""personal trainers"", you will see women on the verge of starvation, and a freakishly muscular man. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! It's stupid. No one needs to be that thin or that muscular. It't just dumb."
5,Birdscapes 329 Triple Tube Bird Feeder,"I previously owned one of these feeders and a large limb crashed down upon it and destroyed it. I was able to find a replacement on Amazon.com and ordered it immediately. This feeder saves me money on seed every month. Other feeders have I owned allow larger birds such as Blue Jays and Red Headed Woodpeckers to use their beak to rake out seeds causing me to go through a lot of seed. That made the squirrels happy. This feeder dosen't stop that from happening but does make it more difficult for them. My wife and I love this feeder. Many different type birds can feed at the same time. Here in Texas, I only use the wild sunflower seeds which attracts just about every kind of bird we have in our area. In the Winter and early spring I use Thistle seeds for the Finches. It is a well built feeder and holds enough feed to last almost a week. I strongly recommend trying this feeder."
2,Squirrels Are Eating It,"I have used, with great success, a Kfeeder Enterprise, Inc. triple tube feeder for years which finally needed to be replaced. I understand that they are no longer available. I have been searching for a replacement for a large triple tube feeder and I came across this item.It is not squirrel proof!I ordered it on 8 JUN 12 and installed it upon delivery, so it has been in place less than three weeks. Squirrels have already eaten off most of the bottom tray. Thankfully the feeding stations themselves are metal or they would be gone too.I do not mind providing some feeding for squirrels, but I do mind them eating the feeder. If you have squirrels I definitely do not recommend this feeder."
4,"When it breaks (whenever that happens), I may lessen my stars","But I have owned this for 2 months & just love its modern, high-tech look. So far everything's great & birds flock to it. Other reviewers' reviews (esp. the bad ones) are very disturbing indeed as seems like they own theirs longer than 2 months. But I cannot just chime in w/ them when mine performs to my satisfaction. If it breaks within a year (touch-wood), I'll revisit this & lessen my stars. Or I may just get a new one from Home Depot (where I got mine) & return the broken one, we shall see..."
1,cheap plastic junk,"I agree with everyone else about this feeder being junk. I too had the problem with the screw top threads cracking, wrapped electrical tape around mine. Part of the filler top broke off & the bottom tray is now cracked. It is also hard to clean. Had this thing 4 months & will not buy this brand again. Big waste of money!"
1,"Definitely NOT ""New In Box""",Feeder arrived broken in 3 places; still had the post-it notes pointing at the breaks from the previous purchaser's return.
1,Cheap junk,"Within the first few months, the hook on top separated from the rest of the feeder, and it shattered on the ground. It's all plastic, and not nearly strong enough for the weight."
1,Not exactly built as described,"Bought this bird feeder for my mom for Christmas. Given to her on Christmas day, and Today January 23, it shattered one of the tubes holding bird food.The description of ""The clear, shatter-proof plastic reservoir makes it easy to monitor seed levels."" doesn't exactly hold any water :o(What happened to spending decent money expecting a decent product??"
4,Amazingly fast shipping,I have ordered multiple copies of this on a couple of different ocassions. They arrive in 3-5 days. The price is great and the book qualifies for bulk pricing (buy 3 get 4) and free shipping on purchases over $25. A much better deal than through CBD.
5,a glimpse of their Imperial Highnesses persons...,"If you are a Romanov fanatic this movie is a must for you!! It is very touching, excellent narration, this movie has captured moments that you won't find anywhere else."
5,STEPS WORTH FOLLOWING,"I'm surprised to find so few reviews for this unique singer here. If you haven't heard Wendy Matthews do yourself a favour! She has a refreshing sound that is to my ears sublimely restrained. Canadian born, her music is sometimes infused with haunting North American Indian references. It's pure, relevant and classy pop."
1,Not the real thing,I thought I could use this product until I had enough money to put a real alarm in my new van. This product does not work like the instructions says it will. Do not buy this item.
5,No problem,"Remote works, have to have alarm cked &/or recoded etc. may be something in alarms circuitry. may even buy new alarm."

5,The Emerald Tablets or The Bible?,"I'll take The Emerald Tablets of Thoth The Atlantean by Doreal.This book is seriously power packed. If you've ever been out there. If you've ever blazed across the Universe like a beam,friction free(the ones who have know what I'm talking about), this is the guide for you to read before you do it again."
5,A History of California; the Spanish Period,"Charles E. Chapman wrote this book about 1928, before our country became so PC. So he wrote in an honest, clinical way. Very informative book and quite comprehensive. I would recommend this tome to anyone interested in California and how it was settled."
3,"good, not great","I used the lower mounting plate with a DIN radio.It positions the DIN radio in the middle of a bigger space. It would be nice to have a small storage space above or below.It seems tough enough, but is more flexible than I like.It was hard to get the radio aligned as straight as I wanted it - the screw holes are large enough to move around (which is probably necessary given variability in the console mount points), but there is not much to reference against, and the mount kept slipping as I tightened the screws. So I did many iterations of tighten, step back, look at it, measure it, then try to loosen and move it just a little in the right direction, re-tighten and move again. And it is still not quite straight. Maybe a unique Volvo 240 issue."
1,Not made for any stereo manufactured in the last 20 years...,"Although the description claims that this product will fit any DIN or ISO DIN stereo (your standard stereo size), it doesn't. Unless you're planning on cutting out parts of the faceplate, there's no way this will fit any stereo made within the last 20 years."
1,Lousy Contrast,"This tv has a terrible picture, everything looks green, the preset video modes are dark and hard to see. It has good sound for a small tv but the picture stinks."
3,Not so hot for regular TV,"The regular TV tuner is a little bit low end...however if you plan on using this for Hi-Def applications or as a PC monitor, the picture quality is very good! Max resolution of 1024x768"
1,Terrible TV!,"This was the first HDTV I ever bought. Within the first month of purchasing the TV, the TV began to have yellow vertical lines running the entire length of the TV. I contacted Magnavox, via telephone, and after argueing with customer service they agreed to ship me another TV. I hated the TV because:1. no matter what channel you are watching, the picture was too dark2. I had to constantly adjust the contract and tint settings depending on the channel you had it onI had this TV for only 4 months and sold it in my local newspaper for only half of what I paid for it. Take my advise and DON""T BUY THIS TV. YOU WILL REGRET IT! Shortly after selling this TV, I purchased a Vizio, 20 inch LCD HDTV. It's a great TV and priced very reasonably. I would highly recommend it over the Magnavox."
2,keyless bypass,"I could not get this product to work on my '99 Ford Explorer.I may have just bought a bad one.I didn't bother sending it back. I ended up buying one that you insert a key into the electronic circuit,and it works great."
2,My flies ignore this product,I live in the country and we have a lot of flies this year. I bought four of these quick bayt strips and after two days I have yet to see a fly be attracted to any of them. Mostly the flies just ignore them.
4,I wanted more...,"Being a big fan of TSoM, I really wanted to love this single. While More isn't my favorite song, I was excited by the b-side, You Could Be the One. Boy, was I disappointed.YCBtO is, well, cheesy. The music is good enough, standard Sisters fare, but the lyrics? Groan inducing. We all know how pompous Andrew Eldritch can be, but this was surprising, even for him. Lines like ""You could be the one to get your flower pressed, you could be the one so get undressed"", are just so uninspired and trite.However, seeing as how TSoM don't have many official releases, I'm giving this 4 stars just for the addition of this unknown song (although it might have been best left unreleased).Bottom line: buy it only if you're a diehard fan."
4,Kingz Kid,One of the powerful cd's on the market. This album will help you though all of lifes situations that may come about. God will speak to you though the vision that he has placed on the artist. A must have addition to your cd collection.
3,"Meh, their mini clips are better.","They do clip well enough to seal a bag, so that's a plus, but the magnets in these are not very strong, contrary to what the product description says. I like to be able to store these on the side of my fridge so I have less clutter in my kitchen drawers, but if you bump one of there more than gently, they fall right off. I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to return them or not."
2,Not good as a textbook at all,"Mathematics is charming and fun to read, only if it is presented in a thought-invoking way, as we see in the old-style classical math books. Sadly, the line has been broken here. In this book, the rich materials, since the book tries to encompass everything, were presented in a terribly dry and desperate way. The world is already full of miseries, so my friend, be nice to yourself and don't use this book as a textbook. Perhaps it better serves as a reference book, as some previous reviewer already pointed out."
3,Should be titled 'Basic Engineering Mathematics',"This book definitely does not live up to its fancy pants name. Do not delude yourself (as the previous reviewer has) into thinking anything in Kreyszig's text is advanced. Now, with that said, I don't have a problem with the text itself; I simply object to the way it is used in undergraduate engineering education. Often it is used as the primary text for a series of courses in differential eq., linear algebra, vector calculus, complex analysis, etc. There are many other texts that treat these topics in greater detail, with more emphasis on theory. While it is true that this book makes a handy little reference, it certainly is not pedagogically sound as a primary text. Professors need to stop choosing this text for their courses."
1,Mis-leading info,"Seller explicitly said new harcover, I recieved a used softcover, in sub-par condition. I would not buy from them again."
3,The bare minimum,"Professors, do not choose this book for your introductory differential equations, linear algebra, vector calculus and complex analysis courses. There are other texts which treat these topics separately, in greater detail, with at least some emphasis on theory. Kreyszig's monster-sized text and others like it really rob students of a deeper understanding of the subject matter."
1,Absolutely hard to read!,"As a nuclear Engineering student its a good thing I have a strong background in the areas of calculus DE's and the such. If I were to have learned simple ODE's with this book I probably would have failed. There is a lot of info here, but it is conveyed poorly. I will definitely sell this back and look for a better reference book."
3,Can be best used as a reference,"Advanced Engineering Mathematics (AEM), by Kyeyszig, was recommended as the textbook in my Maths-2 course, in the 3rd semester of my computer sc. B.Tech. The book was however of little help to me. Although the book covers a very wide range of topics, none of them is dealt with any detail. Crucial explanations are missing at a number of places.However, with additional texts for the topics covered, using AEM as a reference is good, but certainly not as a stand-alone textbook. For the sheer coverage of AEM, and for its exciting end-of-chapter problems, I certainly recommend AEM as a reference book, but not as a textbook."
2,Jack of all trades and a master of none,"This text of Kreyzig tries to cover too many topics in one text. For example, partial differential equations chapter 11 does not even introduce the student to the Sturm-Lioville problem. As a physics student I do not recommend this so-called engineering text to supplement your understanding of PDEs. Its not even good as a reference. I highly recommend ""Boundry Value Problems"" by David L. Powers. His book treats the subject of PDEs rather wellIts fine for engineering students, i.e. cook-book approach, but not a very good text for science students"
1,Advanced Engineering Mathematics,"This book is useless as a learning tool. It should never be used as the primary textbook in an engineering mathematics course. The explanations are incomplete and extremely poor. The author often forgoes a general explanation of new concepts. Instead the author tends to focus on a single example, forcing the reader to generalize the concept on his or her own.Even as a reference its utility is dubious. In the 15 years that I've had this book, I have only succesfully extracted useful information from its pages a handfull of times."
5,Excellent reference text,"This book was quite a revelation to me. Previously I had used books by Indian authors only. I do not deny that they were good, but this author's way of presenting the material was quite superb.The text was comprehensive, replete with problems of all sorts, which when worked out will ensure a complete grasp of the the most intriguing and intricate aspects of engineering mathematics.I loved this book, and am still using it."
5,Beautiful Math Book!,"Though ""beautiful"" is not usually an adjective for a math book, this book is the exception. The book is a handy reference for the engineer or the student of higher mathematics. It covers the basics of HIGHER MATH which is of great versatility. The organization and presentation of the material is excellent, grouping similar or ""connected"" concepts allowing a fluidity that facilitates its use. I love this book!"
4,It's homework,It's very thorough and covers a wide range of mathematics which I have found to be helpful. It was also the least expensive textbook I have ever had to purchase.
2,Advanced Engineering Mathematics 8th Edition,I am using this book in my undergraduate studies and in my opinion this textbook is not very good in explaining or demonstrating throught its example problems the concepts needed to successfully complete the exercises at the end of each section. Often I must refer to another text to get a better understanding on how to approach and ultimately solve the exercises. Additionally I feel this textbook is not very well organized.
1,Terrible Book,"Kreyszig obviously knows what he is talking about, but lacks showing it. It is hard to beleive that Mathematics book so thick has examples that miss complex steps, simply because these steps are deemed 'elementry' by Kreyszig's mathematic standards. The examples are workable, but they only take a few hours of analysing and calculating the multiple lines of mathematics he Kreyszig didn't feel like entering"
2,NOT a textbook in the classical sense,"The popular recommended 'text book' that this is, it really takes on a task too large to condense into some 1100 pages. You just can't do that. Okay, if you're great at Math and want to revise yuor concepts of have a quick reference, this is a decent book. Well, much better than decent. BUT, and here's what matters, if you want to UNDERSTAND what engineering math is about, you absolutely have to get text books for each of the subjects Kreyszig deals with: Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra, DiPrima/Boyce for ODE and so on...this book won't get you there. Having said that, no book can do that!"
2,Not for the Mbox,"The cable seems quite sturdy but I ordered it for a specific purpose, to connect to the Firewire 400 port of the Digidesign Mbox2 Pro, a Pro Tools recording device and the iMac 800 port. It doesn't make a firm connection with the Mbox port, unfortunately, causing the Mbox to disconnect when moved even slightly. I returned it and got the the Sonnet 400-800 adapter that connects to the port on an iMac. Then I used the original 400 cable that came with the Mbox and it makes a solid connection at both ends.This will be an issue now that the new Macs have eliminated the Firewire 400 ports and most music devices still use that protocol."
5,MGM MIDNITE MOVIES R THE BEST DEAL OUT THERE,"When I was a teenager, I thought Last Man On Earth was too slow. Now, I get it. Plus now I accept the low budget as a plus for a story like this.I bought a set of 20 movies for $20 from Fry's. The quality was terrible but I got to see a whole buncha movies I wont spend more than a buck on. And from that selection I loved Last Man On Earth and White Zombie. I sought out better viewing copies of Last Man... and White Zombie and couldnt be happier. They are Keepers.Last Man... is well acted, well-directed, well-scripted. A Super Downer of an ending but that was the '60s for you : = )Panic In Year Zero... I always thought the girl was played by Diane McBain so it is a revelation to find out it is really someone named Mary Mitchel ! Not a great movie but keeps moving along and not moronic like a lot of AIP produced shtuff.The real point of any dvd Amazon review is the print quality and these are just great. Special Feature is a Richard Matheson featurette !"
4,VINCENT STEALS THE SHOW,This film offers chilling sets and Price at his best. Price as someone who must fight onno matter how hopeless the odes are.B&W; horror at its most chilling.
4,One of my FAVORITES from Chiller Theater!,"This movie has got to be one of my favorites from my childhood. It knocked the stuffing out of me as an kid. We had Chiller Theater on Friday nights in Columbus, where Fritz the Night Owl would show scary movies and make dry, cutting, comments at the commercial breaks. I used to wait all week to see what was on. I have always been a big Vincent Price fan, and this movie was part of the reason why. I still groan, ""Morgan, come OUT!"" to freak out my kids. A must have for the horror/Vincent Price afficianado."
3,Panic in Year Zero/The Last Man on Earth,"Panic in Year Zero was well done and worth seeing. The Last Man on Earth was one of the worst ""B"" movies that I have ever seen. Because of this, I could not give the full high rating."
2,Not as good,"Not as good as I remembered as a kid and not a classic. Good suject but poor delivery and ending is very weak. That said, Vincent Price was a classic in his own right."
5,Buy it.,"I purchased this dvd to get a better transfer of ""Last Man on Earth."" Both films are quality transfers with clear picture and sound. Last Man is the best iteration of Matheson's ""I am Legend."" Price, as usual, is fantastic. Panic was entertaining and worthy of repeat viewings. Both films are excellent and worth the price."
1,Very Bad Copy of This Movie,"I noticed that a lot of people have given this movie a good review for the story. I definitely think that it is a classic, but the quality of this DVD is very bad. There are scraches thoughout the movie. There is a line that runs down the left side for the first twenty minutes of the movie. Maybe all releases of this movie are of this poor quality, I can only speak for this one. Don't Buy."
1,not in wide screen,"this is NOT in 2:35-1 widescreen. this is the AIP-TV cut cropped at the top and bottom. get any other version but this one; you will get the entire tv print, not this chop job."
3,Great history,"Panic in the Year Zero is an interesting bit of film history. It's a classic relic of the cold war and an entertaining look at Americans' beliefs about themselves from that time period. I enjoyed the movie.The Last Man on Earth, however, is a total waste. It's boring, silly, incomplete, poorly written, . . . is there anything positive to say about it? Its only claim to fame is that it was sort of based on an original and influential book."
3,Very disappointed,"I had never seen this movie until tonight and I guess I was expectingsomething different.The acting was horrible at best and I feel this could've been a great movie.I am a lover of classic movies, but this was a real let down.Were they Zombies or vampires and the freakin surviving humans were moreof a threat than the mutants. Really silly and none of it made sense."
4,Entertaining Look At How Nuclear War Was Perceived By Hollywood Circa 1960,"Enough folks have discussed LMOE/Omega Man/I Am Legend, so I'm going to focus on Panic in Year Zero. I remember seeing this film in the late 1980s or early 1990s on some random late-night movie channel. A more descriptive title would be to call it ""20 Years Before the Day After"". That is not a dismissive or trite description, especially for those of us who saw ""The Day After"" when it debuted in 1983 on ABC. Considering what was acceptable on the screen (in terms of death, destruction, gore, etc.) this film is typical. It is more of a hopeful message overall than other nuclear war films of that time (Fail Safe, Dr. Strangelove) - such as you can have a ""hopeful"" message to convey in presenting to the screen the end of the world as we know it.For nostalgic purposes it is a worthy film for the genre."
5,Last Man on Earth?,"I really enjoyed this film. I think it is much better than the remake starring Will Smith called I am Legend, same name as the book which inspired both films. This is the oldest zombie film I have seen so far, what surprises me is in this film these Vampires? are not called zombies. This movie was similar to Night of The Living Dead because of the ghouls and the tragic ending with the hero getting killed as a result of mistaken identity by people who shoot first and ask questions later."
2,When it's too good to be true,"This is a review of the German Blu-ray. Perhaps its a good thing that during the birthday sequence, this goes, and stays, a word out of sync. It will take your mind off the video, which is just enough out of focus to drive you out of your mind if you dwell on it. A 1080, DTS-HD piece of dreck. Throw the distributor in the pit with the rest of the zombies. Ah, the joys of modern technology!"
5,Best of the I am Legend adaptations,I'd have to rate this as the best of the bunch. Price is convincing in the role and the film explores to varying depths a variety of interesting themes.
3,Some weird idiosyncrysies,"This 1950s original b&w production was shot in Italy, but the script pretends we are in the U.S., even though the countryside and architecture are obviously Italian. Vincent Price, who really isn't much of an actor by today's standards, drives around in big American station wagons, while all around him are tiny Italian Fiats. Crazy, man. A plague has left him the last man on earth, until he meets up with some zombies who seem alive. The score drove me crazy, all swelling violins in minor keys, just like a 1950s TV show. This is interesting as a period piece, but it doesn't compare to anything from today."
5,One of the all-time BEST horror films!,"Like everyone else, I saw this movie ONCE, when I was a kid, and it stuck with me all my life. I tell everyone about it, but couldn't find it until now. I remember not being able to sleep for weeks, afraid of the killer plague and what happens afterwards. Vincent Price is stellar as a man who has lost everyone.... literally"
3,Last Man & Panic,"I was interested in the Last Man On Earth as another adaptation of the short story; I Am Legend. The others are Omega Man, staring Charlton Heston & more recently, I Am Legend, staring Will Smith. None of them are true to the short story.I was interested in Panic In Year Zero because it shows an Amereican family who in a crisis, uses firearms to protect themselves and others in a situation where there is no authority."
3,Panic in Year Zero DVD Review,"An interesting movie starred and directed by Ray Milland, which is ruined by an awful and inappropriate musical score. The black-and-white 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is of very good quality."
3,A Good First Attempt,This was well done with Vincient Price in the title role. Limited because of technology in the 50's but still well donw. The black and white phtography actually made it more suspenseful.
5,I was scared for weeks!,"I saw this movie when first released in 1964(I was 13 years old). I was at the local drive-in with my parents and my younger brother who was eight. The black and white screen, the graininess of the film and the feeling that ""this could really happen"" all affected me. I would scare my younger brother just by saying, ""Morgan, Morgan, come out Morgan!"" He would run and cry and I would run after him and laugh. I think every kid in the neighborhood went to see this movie after our chilling review and theatrics. My brother and I are now 43 and 47 years old. He e-mailed me and told me he found it on amazon.com.I'm going to order it RIGHT NOW!!!! What a GREAT movie!"
5,GREAT BUY,WANT THE FIRST MOVIE OF I AM LEGEND. NOW CAN HAVE MARATHON OF ALL THREE MOVIES. GLAD TO HAVE IT.
4,Wonderful,Great book! Such a touching love story..makes you believe it is possible. I love the way Sharon brings God into her stories.
5,Truly Amazing!,"Close your eyes and listen...""Auh, Bee-Bee and Cee-Cee Winans have done it again!"" you guessed...now open yours eyes and be blessed! I am African American and typically drawn to ""our music."" We are known for our distinct voices, rhythm, and sincerity of our music that can touch your heart like the hand of GOD. However, this couple truly defies that stero-type. Their voices are absolutely amazing and of GOD himself. Their committment to our LORD and SAVIOR is shown through their music. Their musical tesitmonies will fall on your heart and you will hear the voice of GOD. This dual music ministry is amazing and to own this album is to be blessed time and time again.RRW - Indianapolis"
3,Recommendable for the recient Ryuichi Lover,"This huge box contains 10 brilliant CDs. ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"" is the sound track from the mocie with same title and ""Coda"" is the piano version of this include 2 bonus tracks with David Sylvian. ""Media Bahn Live"" is the live tracks from his World tour and ""esperanto"" is written for modern ballet. ""Field work + stepping into asia + the Arrangements"" was formally released only on the LPs. Also contains ""Miraihayarou (Futurism Boy)"", ""Behind the Mask + 3"", ""Complete music Encyclopedia"", ""Left handed Dream"" and ""Ailes De Honeamise"". Unless you have already own these titles, you should better buy this one that this may costs less if you purchase all individual titles imported."
5,wine rack,I was concerned about the red color when I ordered it. I was worried it would be too orange red. But it wasn't. The color in the picture is accurate. I love the style as it isn't something you see everyday. It looks great in my dining room.
4,Nice but Pricey!,"This is very nice. I use it to hold all my liquor and wine! It is fairly compact but it is heavy and high quality. I think it could still be a little cheaper however, afterall it is just wood and metal. It was pre-assembled and doesn't require any work. It doesn't scratch from use and won't move around when stocking or removing bottles because it is hefty! No disappointments. I'd buy it again!"
3,"Looks good, but poorly made and packed.","The product wasn't in the original box. It looked like taken off a shelf (display item). The product was very poorly packed: it came in a box three times the size and inside there was just few scrambled pieces of paper floating around it. Some bushings got lose, one screw fell off and was found in the shipping box.I tried to put it back, but thread in a bushing was broken. It just barely holds the screw.I am going to keep it since I bought it as a present and don't have time to get something else.But it's very frustrating to repair something you just bought for $60.On a good note: it looks really good from the distance.The product was delivered very fast though (in 2 days)."
5,Wall Curio,I really like the curio it saves a lot of space and keeps my valuables locked up. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It also has a mirror which doubles as two things that would take up sapce in your room.
4,Loose shelf,The bottom mini shelf in this product is loose. It can be nice because you can take the self out and go through your items but you can also knock it out easily. Otherwise this is a perfect jewelry box..
1,Showed up damaged and Customer service is a joke.,"I gave this to the wife for Christmas and when she opened the box and removed the cabinet we discovered 2 out of the 3 hinges were ripped out of the cheap wood that looks like compressed cardboard.I emailed the company and had to go back and forth with them. Send pic's etc..They said they would contact their insurance company and get back to me.It's been 30 days and nothing, not a word.The cabinet is very large and heavy.In time something tells me the hinges would rip out anyway from normal use of opening and closing the door."
2,Heavy,"This unit is very heavy. Two people are required for installation. Plus, the installation with three anchors placed in inconvenient locations is not practical and does not add any strength to hold it on the wall. I would never have purchased this if I had known how difficult it is to install. I would purchase the lighter ones that give you the flexibility of hanging over the door as well as the wall."
5,Love it,I love love love this mirror! Great quality and looks so nice on the wall. Best of all it holds all my jewelry and keeps it well organized. It is very heavy so we took the advice of some of the previous reviews and used additional anchors when hanging so there is no chance of it falling off the wall. I can't believe how great it looks.
4,As expected,"Not as nice as the cherry finish one that we have, but perfect for my daughter's white furniture bedroom. : )"
3,2007 Caravan,Good deal compared to local chain stores. Had to take a file to one of the pads because it would not fit in the bracket where it slides. Dont know if there is a big difference between these and the economy pads. Time will tell.
5,Worth the money,"I started my two Comets on this as soon as I got them. They were about an inch long when I got them, and almost a year later, the female is pushing 6 inches! The male isn't far behind. No illnesses or parasites, no bloating or floating problems, beautiful fins and scales, happy, fearless, and active, and rich, bright colors. I feed them fruits and vegetables once or twice a week, but mostly I just feed them this twice a day.I feel I should mention I bought the 150 g bottle of small goldfish pellets for their then-small mouths. They're still eating the small pellets quite enthusiastically, and I'm only just now below the halfway full point (and yes, the food is still good!) When I run out of this in approximately 6 months, I'll definitely be buying this again."
5,Awesome,"I don't know what happened to this in the marketplace, but it's a pity so many people missed it. This is a rockin' gospel album. Fred Hammond is unforgettable in this recording, and Yolanda and Kirk are great too. Sorry you missed it!"
5,Best thing ever,"I just returned from a week long tour of the west using the terrapin. It is one very well thought out, engineered product. I highly recommend it. I downsized from a full size suv to a midsize. The terrapin completely made up the difference in storage space."
1,1 Month later and counting.....,"Product seems to be fine and of good quality, naturally (thule). However, it took Amazon and their carrier 2 seperate shipments to get the order here and month worth of waiting. Once it got here for the 2nd time - it was still missing a part. I have yet to receive that other part. think twice and spend the few extra $ and buy locally, perhaps."
1,Buy this item locally if you can - Amazon can't get order out complete!,"I chose this luggage box because it swings out of the way, but I couldn't order it locally and receive it in time for our upcoming vacation. Amazon said they could get it to me in just a few days. Perfect, I thought! It actually arrived a day earlier than expected - better yet, I thought! NOT SO FAST - I only received box 2 of 2! Called Amazon - after hours (really!) on the phone they said they'd get a replacement order out to me, hoping it would make it in time. The day before we're to leave, the 2nd order arrives - AGAIN BOX 2 of 2! I was furious! Now I have 2 charges on my CC, nothing to put my luggage in, and am waiting for my refund. Amazon has lost me as a customer. Save time - buy or order it locally, even if you have to spend more, it'll be worth it in the long run."
5,Great,"This box comes with a locking device and tailights, features which some of the other trailer hitch cargo boxes do not have. The ability to swing the box out away from the back of the vehicle is fabulous. Attached to our 4runner we still had enough room to park in our garage and so left it attached all summer. It was much more convenient access than our rooftop carrier, so it was very useful to store items like the ice chest and foodstuff. The construction is very solid and the locking mechanism worked smoothly, unlike our rooftop carrier which is often quite difficult to engage. Being narrower than our 4runner and behind the vehicle, this box didn't create any drag. I wish that there were just a few more cubic feet of storage, but this box still deserves 5 stars."
5,Basis of religions,"What can you say about the source from whence all religions flow? The author presents overviews of a number of religions. Proceeding to the basis of spirituality that is available for the person willing to challenge his limitations, let go of the traditional authoritarian religions, and work out the science of his personal spiritual liberation. None other than a direct contact with the Holy Spirit, the Word, the SHABD is the subject matter here.Amazing! Find the Master/Teacher, get hooked up to the Spirit, and achieve Spiritual Liberation. What the others have hidden in parables, shall nots, and rituals is revealed in its plain to see simplicity in the doctors translations of the ideas of the Surat Shabd (Soul Word.)This is an introduction. The real work for the individual begins when he finds the Master."
5,"Slick, Quick cable stripper","Even for just a couple of projects this is worth the investment. Slick, quick. The only way to strip cable is with a razor sharp knife or one of these. If you don't have one of these no matter how careful you try to be you KNOW you will occasionally split the insulation on the inner cable. Sometimes no big deal, you have enough cable to start over, but sometimes there's no slack and you end up with a problem. This thing works easily, no screw ups. Should have bought it 30 years ago."
5,Must have tool,"For any amount of electrical work - this is the tool you have to have in your bag. I used it in refinishing my basement, so it got a major workout - still like new."
2,The actual first sentence of this book,"I have nothing against this book; the drawings are pretty. I'd tell you more about the story but I'm not done HOWEVER, if you're planning to purchase this book , note that the first sentence is NOT ""I always hear the flapping of wings."" There is a prologue of sorts - a one-page drawing of a half-naked girl with big text saying: ""AFTER SEX, A BOY'S SWEAT SMELLS LIKE HONEY."" There are many more suggestive drawings throughout the book. And a hint of incest."
5,A Must For Camping,"I purchased one of these to replace a cheapie we bought at a local dept store. After using it once, we knew we had to have at least one more. LOVE how this cooks, even though it can be a bit heavy. If we get tired of holding it, we lay it against the fire ring & let it do it's thing. We watch our calories, so I just use cooking spray on the bread and it has worked well every time. I wish the carrying bag they sell were a little cheaper because I would love a way to carry these together. I can't wait for Spring and for camping season to begin so we can use the pie iron's again."
4,Cast Iron Pie Irons are the way to go,"I have used Rome cast iron pie irons for close to 40 years. They are the best. Do not go with aluminum pie irons - I have seen them melt during use. We use the round, square, and panini style of pie irons, and have mostly positive comments. The only negative comment is that the latch that holds the handles together while cooking could be better designed. It slides down toward the hot end, making it difficult to unlatch. This is common to Rome pie irons. I do not know of a better design, but would buy one if it was available."
3,messy,"I bought this online without realizing that it doesn't pinch the bread together at the sides. That is the way my parents pie makers work, which is what I was looking for. I thought all pie makers were that way until I recieved this one. I know that is my fault for not researching this product more before I bought it. It's great for making sandwiches. But if you want to put pie filling between bread (or anything else that is a little more messy), it will be falling out of the sandwich."
5,needs simple mod but still the best!,"the only issue with this iron is that the 2 handles are round and there is only an S hook to hold them together, therefore the handles go back and forth and get bent. all i did to fix this was use a 1/8"" drill bit through both handles. then i put a clean screw in one and made the hole bigger in the other so the screw goes in the hole when it is closed and they won't bend back and forth. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
4,I only leave off the fifth star...,"...because I haven't used it, personally. I got it as a present for my father, and he went into conniption fits. Just loves it. Makes panini over his firepit all the time. Wishes he had more for parties."
5,Cooking out by the fire,"We first used these at our friends house and fell in love. We had to buy a set for ourselves and found that we are using them almost every time we have a fire. They are very sturdy and can cook up some delicious food, especially a pot-pie pizza using some tortilla shells as the outside and filling with various ingredients. Every one loves these and you can have some fun making your own food by the fire."
4,works good,we used these on our fire pit in backyard.we have had no problems with them at all.they work just fine.
5,Fiedler and Christmas: Always a Great Match,"For the people of Boston, Christmas music is synonymous with the Boston Pops, and its legendary conductor Arthur Fiedler. This compilation contains Pops classis arrangements including Leroy Anderson's medley of Christmas carols ""A Christmas Festival. It also includes the Pops rendition of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town,"" and the authentic rendition of Anderson's ""Sleigh Ride."" It also includes Fiedler's interpretations of excerpts from THE NUTCRACKER, HANSEL AND GRETEL, and Leopold Mozart's ""Sleigh Ride.""This is a re-release of an RCA Living Stereo recording. The collection has a nostalgic feel to it, and the cover, from an earlier Boston Pops recording, adds to the magic of this collection."
5,Great Christmas Music,"This is a wonderful instrumental Christmas album. I had it on LP and loved Leroy Anderson's Christmas Festival, but couldn't find this album on CD until I tried Amazon."
5,A Great Soundtrack for Your Christmas,"POPS CHRISTMAS PARTY, like Santa's bag of goodies, has a little bit of everything. You'll find traditional carols (Joy to the World, Deck the Halls, Silent Night, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, etc.), popular Christmas favorites (Sleigh Ride, Rudolph, Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, White Christmas), and classical Christmas pieces (selections from `The Nutcracker,' `Hansel and Gretel,' etc.)Whether you're listening while writing Christmas cards, trimming the tree, hosting a Christmas party, or any of a hundred holiday activities, POPS CHRISTMAS PARTY is a great way to bring you into the Christmas spirit.TOTAL TIME 72:38"
1,Poor Quality Creeper,"I purchased this Torin creeper because of the low price, and I liked the adjustable backrest feature. Please save yourself the headache and pass on this crappy creeper.The FIRST time I used it, the handle to adjust the backrest snapped like a twig, making it completely unusable.I don't think I will ever buy a Torin product again after this incident.I also noticed a lot of the supporting structure was poorly made and loose fitting. There is no way this creeper could stand up to any real use.I would recommend either making due with a conventional creeper, or pony up and buy an expensive one with this adjustable backrest feature."
5,Top notch product from Thule.,Top notch product from Thule. Works the way it's suppose to and top notch quality. Every thing you need for installation is included. Good instructions also.
1,doesn't work,"The holder is ok for quarantining fish, but does not keep the babies in. They slip right out of the slots in the sides. It was supposed to protect them but doesn't do a thing for them. Will have to get another type.DO NOT get this if you are trying to breed your fish."
4,Household Hints For Dummies,"What there was in this pocket edition was very helpful.It seems to have done the trick, having me want to go out and get the full version of the book."
3,"Cute, but...","Suzuki Ami is quite a personality, and she's rather cute. But the album could be skipped. I do like ""Love the Islands"" and ""White Key"", but as for the other tracks, it is only Ami's cute voice that makes them listen-able. The songs are, well, forgettable."
4,"Good, and fun, information!","This book was fun to read; A book about medicine has never been so readable! You don't have to be a doctor or a fan of the show to enjoy all the information about what would happen if you, or a loved one, ends up in the emergency room"
4,Good Old Time Guitar Pickin',"If you like guitar music and want to hear how they SHOULD be played, buy this CD. If the GUITAR RAG doesn't get you movin' nothin' will. These songs from '26-'31 will show that the current guitar pickers do not have anything on these boys. BUY the CD.P.S. Amazon sell the same things on cassettes for those of us that don't have CD players in our cars."
3,"Pretty, but not form-fitting. Rather cheap","I like the pretty lace on this camisole. I also like how one side has a square neck while the other side has a V-neck, allowing for multiple styles of usage. I like the length-- it falls to the hips, so I can tuck it in if I want to. (Camisoles are often too short for me, since I'm a DD cup.)My biggest complaint is that it is too loose in the waist! It hangs straight down; there's no natural curve to the shape, so it creates wrinkles under shirts. I got 34, the smallest size available, and it's really loose. I don't like that. I wanted something more form-fitting, something stretchy.The second complaint, which is more minor, is that the material is super thin and seems cheap.I don't necessarily regret buying it, but I would much rather have preferred a tighter fit."
3,"Nice camisole, but ---","It's well made and is a good buy for the price, but runs very large. I wear a Size 34 in a bra, so I ordered the Size 34 in this camisole and it's way too big to wear under anything where I need a smooth line because it bunches up. The photo makes it look very form-fitting, which it probably is if you can order down from your regular size. A Size 30 would have been more appropriate for my needs."
5,Shut your eyes and you're at the concert!,I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money for this live concert CD but it was the best investment I've made in awhile. The band sounds great and Todd's voice is exceptional. I missed the original concert in 1991 but after listening to this double-CD I felt like I was there. Todd produced and mixed it (of course) so you know it's great. A must-have for any Todd fan.
1,Fall apart,These are cheaply made and fall apart. Do yourself a favor and buy the SOS Tuffy nylon scrubber.
1,Shipping outrageous,"I've bought these before and was happy enough to buy them again, until I realized that S&H to Kansas was $35.00. This was the only item in my cart, so nothing else was contributing to the cost of shipping. 35$ S&H for something as light as air, is totally outrageous."
5,Seriously underrated album by seriously underrated band,"Always solid performers, The Silencers peaked with Dance to the Holy Man, a perfect mix of footstompers, catchhy pop tunes and ethereal balladry. Art of Self Deception and Afraid to Love are the classics, but all but a couple of the songs are well above the Silencers' average. Well worth rediscovering."
4,Words on Revelation,"This is one of those books that I did not enjoy reading but I still feel the book is important. It is not that I agree with the subject - It is just that this book if very very ""wordy."" Lots of big words - like the kind you put into a college book report. I did read it twice but it is not for me. However at the same time there is some decent info - hidden between the big words - for the person that likes the subject."
5,Very Good Music,"I really like dthe DVD. I was surprised by how fluid the music was, along with the great sound quality. I recommend this DVD to anyone."
2,Attracting innocent Buyers,"This book is a mix between a light marketing text patched with dated web articles. It might do some good to people thinking about entrepreneurship; it will not be useful to people looking for funding.I ordered the book ($30 !!) in August 2009 and hoped to find strategies and tactics on how to approach European vs East Coast vs West Coast VC. Instead I've found about the history of VC and about FFF sources of money. Cover to cover: less than 15 minutes. I felt the authors took $30 from my wallet.Kotler's name on the cover is the main marketing piece of this book.Buy ""Raising Venture Capital for the Serious Entrepreneur"" instead."
5,Scott's Review,"Commissioned. One of the greatest groups of all time. Really gives it to you with this album. With lush flowing ballads and bangin' joints. This CD gives you all that you need, and will really help you with your walk with Christ. This is the year 2001, and I still rate this album(done in 1996)number one out of all my music I have at home. In church or out of church, I encurage you to buy this album. You wont be disapointed."
3,Floored,"""Shelf Life"" is a strange book. Strangely, I expected words.But I will look through it and later, in a few months, I will look through it again. There is a lot to absorb.."
4,ludovic navarre aka ST-GERMAIN !,"For those who recently tuned into the maestria of ST-GERMAIN,check out this album.It supposedly came out in 1991,is deffinitly more house then the acid jazz that was to follow with ""boulevard""and the recent ""tourist"",but there is deffinitly a vision for things to come.Some of it can possibly remind the listener of CARL CRAIG's INNERZONE ORCHESTRA.Some of it could have escaped the NUYORICAN SOUL recording sessions.The sound is high and the groove is deep.Placed back in the context of it's original release date,it makes this album the legitimate predecessor for anything from deep house to acid jazz,and even when you get the occasional old school flavor,it never leaves an aftertaste."
3,Charging? Yes! Data transfer? Not so much.,"This cable is an excellent, inexpensive alternative charging cable to the ?proprietary? OEM cable included with HTC Hero (CDMA). Re-read that first sentence and you'll understand what it is that you're buying. Yes, it fits/connects with the HTC Hero (Sprint version, CDMA) and I use it with my USB car-charger or OEM wall-charger plus I keep a second as a spare in my laptop bag and am very happy with the purchase. BUT -- every single time I've attempted a large data transfer (such as a sync with my music library) using this cable, it inevitably freezes the process (at a seemingly random point) after anywhere from three to a couple dozen songs thereby causing the need for a drastic disconnect (instead of a suitable ""eject"" of the phone as an external drive). I am very happy with this very inexpensive cable and all that it is capable of doing now that I am familiar with its limitations."
3,Stitching started coming apart almost immediately,"I really like the design and robust feel of this case. It is an excellent rifle case with thick padding on the inside. And the outside material is very tough. It has almost a stiff feel to it. The problem I had is that after only one range trip, the seam already started to come apart. The separation was only about two inches long, but you could see that the stitching failed in that area. I would recommend it if the stitching didn't fail on the one I got. I am disappointed because I really liked this case. Needless to say, I returned it for a refund, which was a pretty easy process by the way. As soon as my refund goes through, I'll be looking for another case, possibly the Blackhawk sportster."
1,Worst disc ever,"Don't be tempted by the low price. It's worthless; it can not be thrown. I mean, yes into the trash, but not through the air like a good disc."
5,This author is amazing,Mary Devries is the best technical writer of our time! It's amazing to find an author who knows what she is talking about...and be up to date! This book is an asset for anyone's collection!
4,Primary source selections from the religions of and in America,"A balanced selection of the diversity of religious expression found in America, from the Civil War, through WWI, WWII, the Cold War, the 1960s and beyond the year 2000. Contained herein are primary source selections on most every group of people making up this ""one nation under God."" This reader is a great resource to commence one's study of religion in America."
1,Kindle edition,"The kindle edition I received does not work at all. It won't let me access the table of contents and every time I try to access a page manually it closes and redirects me back to my library. Very disappointing, especially since I was not able to return it for a refund."
2,Good while it lasted!,"I received this roaster as a Christmas gift this past Christmas. I have several other George Foreman items that we use all the time and love, so we didn't think this one would be any different. I used it to cook a roast - turned out great. Used it to roast two Cornish Hens - they turned out great. Today I put a whole chicken in it. Part way through cooking the thing just quits!! Nothing. Since I've thrown away all of the packaging (it HAS been working for the past month), I don't know if there's anything that can be done about this! Now I see they are discontinued! Figures!"
3,"Uuum, Okay....","I'm not really sure what the author is trying to say, or to whom she is writing. The average 14-year-old, attempting to read this book, is going to be a little confused, I think.There is a lot of well-described pain,but very little explanation as to how Bee's situation began, and how her feelings became everyday enough for her to accept them as normal. Granted, the book is disturbing, and I admire the author's passionate understanding of an incest victim's pain and confusion."
2,Weird....Really weird.,"I found this book very odd, and sinful. A brother, trying to get his own sister (who is only 14) to have sex with him? I didn't even understand the book! It's was weird, short, and disgusting."
2,WHAT IS THE AUTHER TRYING TO SAY?,"I AM QUITE CONFUSED BY THIS BOOK bee and jackie. I AM 25 Y. OLD, BUT WHAT IS SAID IN THIS BOOK IS NOTHING. ""AT NIGHT HE OPENS THE DOOR AND LAYS ON TOP OF HER COVERS MOVING"". WHAT IS SHE TRYING TO SAY? SHE NEEDS TO BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE AND TO THE POINT, SHE KIND OF GOES WAY AROUND IT. THE BOOK IS WAY TO SHORT FOR READING AND IN THE END IT LEAVES YOU HAINGING THERE."
5,TOTALLY AWESOME!!!,"This was the most awesomeness uncut dvd of anruto ever because there was so much cussing and bloody scenes and i personally think that the uncut version is the best on the earth and its very different then on tv. I really wish this was on adult swim first than stupid cartoon network, but the episodes were all awesome and so was the battles with the sound four!! 5/5 and worth buying"
5,I'm a Naruto Otaku!,"I love Naruto, and although we are now going into the suckiest arc of life, because of the ending of the arc, the animation and the fighting only get better from here. This arc has some of the best fights in all of the original Naruto seris. I just can't wait for the rest of this seris to come out and for Shippuden to begin. Viva la Naruto!"
3,Why are people so shocked...,"to ""discover"" this isn't exactly a cinematic classic?? Just the title and the fact that Lugosi is in it pretty much tell that story (let's face it; after Dracula, Bela did nothing but B and C movies except for an occisional cameo).The one actor really wasted here is Hattie McDaniel. Be that as it may, the movie's amusing in its own Ed Woodish sort of way. Interesting more as a history capsule of sorts, due to the early reference to TV."
3,Classic science fiction,"The title of this movie interested me. I did not expect it to be one better science fiction movies I have seen and it was not. However, it was a typical Bela Lugosi, low budget movie, but still entertaining."
2,The original flat screen,"An inventor makes a TV network that does not need a relay to broadcast across the world. Everyone wants the secret to the electronic tube that can do this. It includes industries and governments and cabals.During his maiden transmission of piano music, the inventor will reveal a new addition. Unfortunately he is all choked up and the shadow of death crosses the screen. Yep the inventor is dead and everyone that should have been watching the broadcast was elsewhere. Among the who-dun it's is Bella's twin brother. We also get the added how was it done?The film was scratchy and badly cut. The dialog, well lots of talking, but little is relevant to the story. The plot was too ambitions for the simple conclusion."
2,Info for those interested...,"... in buying this movie. It is also included in the ""50 Classic Mysteries"" movie set that you can get for under $15 here on Amazon."
4,Shockingly lousy!,"I suppose we're all being murdered by television to some degree but here the title is somewhat miseading. Its not really murder BY television (as in forcing someone to watch Jim Carey, for example) but murder ON television.This minor quibble aside, MBT is incomprehensible, dull, has offensive racial stereotypes and acting not unlike Plan 9. So what's not to like? I knocked off one star as this isn't one of Bella's films that also stars the Bowery Boys...sigh...Oh - to add to the hilarity the print has more scratches than a driver's ed movie with some bits spliced out altogether. In short, its great! Highly reccomended."
2,Not Even Twin Belas Can Save This One,"This is a dull mystery centered around the inventor of a television system. Suddenly, the inventor is killed right as he is making a broadcast. Whodunit? Prime among the suspects is Bela Lugosi, who plays the inventor's assistant. But no, it's not Bela. We discover him to be just another red herring as he is killed later on in the film. However, all is not lost. Bela's twin brother (?), a federal inspector, shows up and in only five minutes, unmasks the killer. Why couldn't he have shown up thirty minutes before and saved us all this dull talk? Look for Hattie McDaniel in an early role as the stereotypical servant. This obscure feature (it scarcely played any dates when originally released back in 1935) is recommended only for die-hard mystery fans and hardcore Bela fans."

2,100 pages useless,"I understand this is a used book, but at least 100 pages with all kinds of activities are already filled out. Really? Some in pen!!!Very disappointed."
5,Glory Be To The Name Of The Most High!,"Hezekiah Walker & The Love Fellowship Crusade Choir are awesome! With a choir full of Young people who don't mind lifting up the name of JESUS! Along with the ANOINTED one himself, Pastor Walker. You can't go wrong with the Two! God Bless and Keep On Keepin' On!"
1,it Broke!,"The support ring broke the first time I used it. Fortunately for us, it broke immediately after we installed it. We had bolted it to the studs, bolted to the television and then we moved it around to check the articulation. The ring around the main tube may have been cast aluminum or some other light alloy but it should have been steel. It broke in half immediately but fortunately we were ready to catch the television.It was a pretty important part that failed, you'd assume that they'd have engineered it correctly or at least tested it to see what the failure weight was. Unfortunately I had purchased this mount several months before I actually used it so I didn't even try to enforce a warranty."
3,Emotionally Absorbing,It's a gripping and complex story that draws you in and doesn't let go. The story is so powerful that it is easy to overlook the fact that it is written like a newspaper article.
2,Develops Criticism towards Central Americans,"This Non fiction story is noway useful or entertainment to book readers in North America. Better be released in Central America. This story tells about how many people and how long the Central Americans are flooding to the USA which develops more criticizing mentality towards Central Americans. This story also tempting the people who wants to travel to the USA. She didn't need to go through a life threatening journey to write this book. Non fiction story is not just a story, we need to think about artifacts. Of-course this book is useful for students who study English as a second language for vocabulary."
2,"Mediocre, Repetitive Book","We had to read this as part of my freshmen orientation for the university I attended. Almost everyone, including fellow students as well as my professors, found this novel to be extremely repetitive and not a very engaging read. The author does a poor job of creating a linear narrative for the story, and the myriad of places and people Enrique encounters are not really explored at depth. His relationships with the people he meets along the way are essentially ignored, and I came away with the impression that Enrique literally did not have a personality whatsoever. I realize that this is a (mostly) non-fiction account of a difficult journey, but the best journalists make their subjects interesting and human; Ms. Nazario fails in both respects."
5,love it!,Super fast delivery! I was very impressed. I would buy from zonibooks again in a heartbeat. Thanks!
3,Difficult read,"This is very important, but difficult to read. Feel like lots of the info was repeated, so there was a sense of déjà vu. Having the story written in present tense was irritating to me. Some books I want to learn what will happen next...is one I was afraid of what would happen next."
2,Writing style for Journey-,"What the people do to overcome their poverty and separation from their mothers was truly amazing. The story was very inspirational but depressing. As a journalist, Ms. Nazario is very talented and courageous. However, we read this in my book club and we all felt we were reading a long article out of the newspaper. In order to transfer a journalist writing style in book format we believe she needed some assistance. Half of the people in our book club did not finish it due to that. It is unfortunate, since the information is truly eye-opening."
3,Illegal Immigration,"I found this book interesting but not easy to read. The flow was interrupted in several places and I questioned the sincerity and authenticity of Enrique on numerous occassions although it probably was an embellishment more than untruth. Having been to Honduras in the past two years, there is a movement to improve the lives of Hondurians in general, although it probably will take a long time like elsewhere. Also, since the book is written by a third party, the emotions where not conveyed in a - for me - believable manner. Still, the journey is harrowing and difficult. I feel for the kids involved."
1,A story that needed to be told...but not like this!,"I picked this up, only to put it down after a few pages. The author's rather melodramatic approach made the story seem more like a cheap, badly-written novel than a nonfiction account. I just didn't see any sense that the author had 'connected' with the subject, and so I couldn't connect with it, either."
2,Enrique's Journey,"The content was important to read but the delivery was pretty repetitive. It is good to understand the plight of the people who attempt to enter the USA illegally. It certainly raised awareness of the struggle of the mothers and their children. However, I think the information might have been more impactful in a different venue like an article, not an entire book."
5,Glad I found this,"I bought this book for my homeschooled 10th grader. He hasn't read it yet but it's a brand new book and after I read about it, it seems like a book I might even read when he's done."
4,enrique's Journey,"Have you ever wondered what drives thousands of people to enter the US illegally along our southern border? Enrique's Journey is the true story of an impoverished Honduran family and the risks its members take to find the resources to keep themselves alive. I had no idea of the huge numbers of children who flee to our country, looking for the parents who had immigrated to find work in order to support their families back in Mexico and the Central American countries. Difficult to read, but impossible to put down, Enrique's Journey advances the dialogue we need to have in this country over immigration. The story helps one to walk in another's shoes and to have some compassion for those in abject poverty and who still have a fierce desire for a better life."
5,Excellent instructions for everyone!,This is a great resource for parents/siblings/babysitters. Knowing what to do in an emergency makes a huge difference. It's a great thing to have on hand. Those first several minutes in an emergency are often the most crucial and practicing these skills can make a huge difference.
1,Outdated info,This video has outdated information on the correct ratio for CPR. Needs to be updated!
2,Infant and Child CPR What Every Parent Should Know DVD,"Excellent information except for one thing, it does not follow American Heart Association 2006 guidelines for breath and compression ratio. Supposed to be 2 breaths to 30 compressions. This video teaches 1 breath to 5 compressions."
5,Excellent Information,As a mother of 3 children under the age of 5 I found this program very good. I liked the fact that it wasn't too long. I could go back to any segment that I wanted to and could review it at any time. Unlike attending a full length CPR class which can take hours and I don't need to know the infant material which would be a waste of my time to sit through. It was understandable and definetly worth the price.
5,must have for all babysitters,"I thought that this DVD was a great way to improve my CPR! The child who I am now currently babysitting parent's told me that I needed to know CPR before I could babysit their kid. I also was thinking about learning CPR because I have twin cousins who are 3 years old and I would hate for something to happen to them and I wouldn't know what to do. I have also heard many tragic drowning stories. I think that every babysitter should watch this DVD just incase! Also, if possible to take a CPR class. This DVD really made me realize the dangers there are around swimming pools and small toys that children could choke on! Now I will know what to do if something should ever happen when I would need to use this!"
4,WISTFUL & HAUNTING,"This experimental, ""avant garde"" album gave no indication of the Eurythmics' subsequent melodic pop direction and megastardom. It fits in more with the work of late 70s experimentalists like Brian Eno, Holger Czukay and the like. Sometimes it even sounds like the later Cocteau Twins or ""world music."" It's a very atmospheric work and does contain at least two classics: the intricate Belinda with its cascading guitar textures, mournful drone and oriental backing vocal building up to a scorching climax is quite impressive, as is She's Invisible Now, a sorrowful song with a haunting countdown effect. English Summer is replete with crickets & stuff, whilst Your Time Will Come also has a catchy melody. So, not recommended for Eurythmics fans. People who like Dead Can Dance, the above-mentioned German artists, Brian Eno's ""My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts,"" Deep Forest etc. will certainly enjoy it."
2,In the TRASH,I am a big Eurythmics/Annie Lennox fan. I love all their other albums except this one. The only good songs on this album is Never gonna cry again and Belinda otherwise don't buy this album unless you just want to collect all their 12 albums.
4,A great suprise!,"I was alittle hesitite to listen to this cd when I first heard about it. A reviewer on youtube said this album was a really good, and if anybody liked pop music you should get it. I was skeptical and decided to listen to it on my long drive back from college. Wow, was I surprised! This album really seems to be a head of its time and doesnt date itself. Annie Lennox's vocals are really great on this album. This album is def. an underground, have to be a complete 80's music fan to buy this cd. But it's def. worth it to anybody that's a good fan of rock music. It could def. be released today, and it would do pretty good on the charts, in my opinion. All the tracks seem to be effortless and easy to listen to!"
4,I've always loved this album/CD,"I'll make this short and sweet: I have always loved In The Garden since I bought in on vinyl when it was first released. In retrospect, I actually like it much better than Sweet Dreams. I can remember being disappointed with Sweet Dreams because it strayed from the sound of In the Garden. Bottom line: buy this CD if you are A) a Eurythmics fan; B) a Tourists fan; C) a lover of very good music."
5,Good Album,"This is actually a pretty good album. Much better than Eurythmics' latest album ""Peace"". If you liked all the songs on the ""Sweet Dreams"" album, you should like this one too, but it lacks a super hit like ""Sweet Dreams (are made of this)"". Eurythmics at their finest in the synth pop genre."
3,In the Depths of Winter,"A murder in a tiny Dartmoor village in the dead of winter sets the stage for this classic Christie whodunit. Several had a motive, few had an opportunity. The most likely suspect is quickly imprisoned, but his fiance remains unsatisfied with the law's conclusions. Determined to clear James Pearson's name, Emily Trefusis sets off with intrepid newspaper reporter Charles Enderby to seek out the circumstances of Major Treveylan's murder. As with all of Christie's books, we get plenty of atmosphere as the plot unfolds in the Dartmoor countryside. Here we see the deepest depths of winter. This novel has all of the elements of a juicy, quick read. The plot and suspense build as we follow Emily on her quest for answers. This is classic Christie- a bit of brain-fluff, for sure, but engaging and well-written."
3,Decent but not one of the best..,"I started reading this book after I've finished reading ""Crooked House."" The fact is that I did not get as satisfaction as ""Crooked House"" from the latter book, but it was somewhat OK, I would have to say. I would recommend reading all the ""essential"" books from Miss Christie's official web site. All the selections from the list are awesome and intriguing in many ways. I have no choice but to give this book a three star. I am Christie fan and I have the right to be critical. : - P"
1,JSimon,"I hated this CD, and the amount of money paid for this was a waste. I always loved him as a blues singer, so I thought the gospel would be OK, that`s a NO-NO. Mary Specks"
4,Me Tarzan You Jane,"Both of these vintage Jayne Krentz books are dated but interesting to read. When she first came out with these I think that she was one of the very few romance authors doing fantasy/sci-fi/futuristics of that type so she was definitely breaking new ground. The problem is she used the old bodice ripper model to do it and her males are a bit more alpha than the 21st century reader is used to. These two books are more in her Stephanie James style of writing than her Crystal, Quick or Krentz style of writing. So brace yourself. The heroes are of the ""Me Tarzan you Jane --and you mine"" and the heroines are of the ""No. I mean yes. I mean no. I mean yessss .... (insert moan)"" type. They are still fun to read -- just realize that it's been a few years since they were written and they're not exactly politically correct."
4,"Loved the first story, not a fan of the 2nd","I had read Sweet Starfire years ago and was excited when I found this version. 2 for 1 deals are the best!However the 2nd story I found boring and unreadable. Maybe one day I will attempt it again, but after the freat story of Cidra, I just couldn't get into Cyrstal Flame. I like most Jayne Ann Krentz but that one was just difficult to get through."
2,look elsewhere,"Picked this up for a couple dollars at a discount book shop. Translation is in kanji and romanji. The romanji is useless as it leaves you spelling words wrong once in hiragana. The kanji is too small to make out. There are plenty of errors in the book, and the only use I have for this is to confirm words that I already know but I am confusing the translation of. Translation is only English to Japanese so leaves you guessing if trying to translate Japanese text.That said I can't recommend this book to anyone trying to learn Japanese."
5,My first non acne moisturizer at age 39,"This is what I call my first grown up moisturizer. The fact that it is Hypoallergenic and Non-comedogenic for sensitive skin works perfectly for my acne prone, oily and sensitive skin. I will use this cream only in the winter as my skin is dryer. The smell is something to get used to. The first time I wore this creme, the smell irritated my nose all day. Then after 4 days, I didn't notice it as much. I would definitely recommend this product. A++++ all around. My skin is soft and non greasey and this cream does not break me out at all. Goes well under my BB cream."
3,It's o.k.,I bought this together with the body lotion. I didn't care for the body lotion and he smell. The face cream is nicer. I'll it a couple weeks. But I don't think lotions for sensitive skin should have perfume as a main ingredient .
1,Love the face wash; allergic to this face cream.,"I have loved the face wash (see my other review) and tried the face cream today. I found it caused a burning sensation on my face, was greasy feeling and made my skin shiny. It smelled terribly perfume-y, so much so that I ended up coughing. I've had better luck with Aveno lotion on my face, but it too has a subtle unpleasant odor, although it is described as ""fragrance free."""
1,Could not stand the scent,"This product may work, but I really couldn't stand the horrendous smell-- I ended up washing it off my face and hands before I could experience any benefits. I gave it to a friend to try and she commented on the strange smell as well."
4,"So far, so good","I've tried so many face creams with my sensitive skin - this one seems to be working well. It's only been 2 weeks, but I really like it."
2,Lacks documenation,"I received the product in a simple box with no instruction manual. The product looks as indicated in the picture. The adjustable weight is really two weights: the metal knob pictured unscrews from the larger metal cylinder, and the metal cylinder can be unscrewed. There is no indication how heavy each weight is.The grip-aid seems accurate, but I'm not sure how useful that would be on a typical golf club that does not have contours for grip placement.There is no indication on the box how many times a day I should use the trainer.Amazon's product description page promises more features and capabilities from the tool than the box lists. I'm not sure how this tool is supposed to improve tempo and timing or the release.End result, since I'm not clear on how to use the product or how it helps me then I'm not motivated to use it. Better to avoid this product and find a swing trainer with better instructions."
4,Good quality & easy to use,"The product is high quality and easy to use. This is a very good choice for hidden camera. I specifically liked the quick install (just a few minutes, and it works!) and the web viewing capability.Drawbacks:1. Has a wide angle view, but still misses a bit. A few more degrees wide would have made it perfect.2. Picture details very good (excellent resolution for the purpose). Color - not good. Most of the time show black & white with very light color. To get good color requires the room to be very lighted.3. It comes with automatic ""relay"" mode that limits web viewing to 3 minutes at a time, and is very slow. Instructions to setup ""direct"" mode exist, but were working for me. I had to do more research to get direct mode working. Once I did, worked perfectly - no time limits, and no delays in web viewing."
4,"great, easy system","The LukWerks spy camera allowed me a great deal of peace of mind when we hired a new nanny. It was very simple to set up, just install the software and plug in the cameras. My husband, with the help of WiLife tech support, was able to set up direct viewing so I had a continuous stream of video to watch while I was at work. If you want to change the area being viewed, simply unplug the camera and plug it in somewhere else.The only drawback, the picture is a bit grainy, but for my purposes it is entirely sufficient."
2,"Looks nice, but not worth $7.99","I can buy travel mugs at Dollar Tree for $1, and they work just as well at keeping my coffee hot. The first time it was washed (BY HAND) water got in between the layers, so now it looks foggy, not shiny like it did when I took it out of the box. Save you're $$$ and go to a dollar store!!!"
1,Nothing doing...,"Although the description of this tape says it fits my Dad's typewriter, it doesn't. Another scam in the WWW"
5,great,love the books give them to many people.really a great gift thanks so very very very much. Thanks thanks thanks thanks
1,Same old story from Diana Palmer,"I gave up on Diana Palmer a few years ago but picked up this book at a thrift shop just to see if her style had changed a bit. Not a chance. Her plots are EXACTLY the same: young naive girl, arrogant older man. Her heroes are always very insecure men that treat the heroines like trash. I forgot to count the times that he hug/kiss/caress her to be followed by hurtful words. Way too repetitive; like she ran out of ideas."
2,Oh goodness...,"Curse my inability to put down a book when I start it. I always have to finish a book no matter how terrible it is and I find myself coming up with whatever excuse I can find during the day to avoid another page of this. The dialogue is repetitive, the story slow, the elegance of the time period is not captured at all rather the the absurdity of the mordernizing mindsets...I just don't like it at all so boring! and it's a 19 year old inexperienced naive girl falling for a 36 year old...there is something kinda creepy about that whole picture."
5,"Classic, soul-searching, masterpiece","When I fell for Greg Dulli, I fell hard. It was 1993 and I was in tenth grade. I listened to ""Gentlemen"" every day. With that said, this album isn't for everyone. But you should listen to it anyway. It has everything to do with excellent guitar playing, song composition, and Greg Dulli's unrivaled delivery and phrasing. He is a rock n'roll genius. And that's what ""Gentlemen"" is, a great rock n' roll album.I have re-discovered the Whigs (even though they are no more) just this year. I stopped buying their albums because I was certain NOTHING could be as good as this one. I was wrong, if you like this album, buy ""1965"". It's equally amazing. Greg Dulli is once again igniting every spark in my soul and singing it into the ground. There is no one (who's white) that can sing like him.Another note, astronaut Neil Armstrong absoutely adores the Afghan Whigs."
5,Just another 5 star rating.,"This album is one of the reasons the 90s were the best years for music since the 50s. It's hard to find musical integrity and quality like this these days, that's for sure. My how things have changed... MTV use to be responsible for wonderful shows such as '120 Minutes' which showcased talent like the Afghan Whigs, Juliana Hatfield and Bob Mould because the music mattered. Now MTV and the radio is rubbish. But we'll always have 'Gentlemen' and the memories."
5,sexual frustration never sounded so good,the personal intensity on this album has yet to be matched by any rock artist (alternative or otherwise) in recent music history. All the Whigs albums are great but 'Gentlemen' is superior.
5,Unforgettable,"Nobody sang about the dirty side of love like the Whigs. This is their masterpiece, a truly perfect record from first lovelorn, alcohol-soaked note to the very last.The Whigs are no more but their songs still give me chills."
4,Great cd,Had this cd in the 90s and sold it for extra money. Now I have it again and it's just as good as I remember.
3,Behaving badly,Gentlemen is a passionate snapshot of early nineties alternative guitar rock- recorded when the scene was still vibrant enough so as to still retain that spark today- yet is still too coarse around the edges to transmute all the screaming into soaring.
3,"Gentleman, Be Sweet, Debonair ...then boredom","I have been ambivalent about this record for years. A slow start builds intensity and then at the climax it just lets you down. Do I really care that much about their pathetic romantic lives? Perhaps, they bored their lovers into leaving them. Perhaps I am just too calloused to be such a gentleman as to give this an overwhlemingly positive review. Perhaps chauvinism bores me. I really like AW but this is not my favorite record. The three songs listed above are genius and the band deserves all the credit in the world for their creativity. I bought the record for just those songs and it was a good investment because I cannot really say it is a bad record either. Perhaps those songs are so good that the others just pale in comparison. In any case, I recommend it but do not get your hopes up after Debonair song"
3,Difficult for my second grader,"We purchased this game to help my second grader improve her math skills. It's a bit too difficult for her this year, we will try again over the summer. It looks like it could be a fun game, though!"
3,Gorilla-sized laughs!,"It can be argued that this book teaches problem-solving and patience, but there's no denying it's affect on the funny bone. Following the line of kid-thinking of 'Hey, you never know', John Hall teaches us to always be prepared. The outrageous, hilarious scenarios will give vigor to the imagination and might invite the most stubborn, bath-apprehensive child to dive into the tub!"
4,Good Read,"For anyone interested in indigenous cultures this book is a great read. The author weaves her story of the difficulties in gaining access to the Andamanese with details about their culture. She chronicles the demise of their society as they are subsumed by contact with civilization, held back by racist attitudes, and caught up in corrupt politics. The consquences are devastating. As the author gets personal with a few of the aboriginals, the reader does too. You can't help but share the author's compassion for their plight."
1,Worst Company I have ever encountered,"You had better hope your item works when you buy it because this company does not know the meaning of the term ""customer service"". It is now going on two months since we started the process of exchanging a defective card for one that works. BEWARE. You can't even find a phone number for corporate headquarters on their web site. Stay away from these people if you don't have the patience of a Saint in dealing with a defective item."
4,Brilliant product - almost perfect,"When purchasing I was very impressed with the much higher capacity of this card to capture video. The card is built well with it's own fan and plenty memory to operate well on it's own. Very feature rich and fun to use. I mainly bought the card for video capture / pvr use. I am very content with the capture ability but felt the remote and full screen entertainment center feature could work better. I was surprised the remote worked better with win 2000 over xp, but even in win 2000 the media center program errored out too frequently and I cannot see myself having the patience to work with it. I am a very good computer tech and will probably not spend the time with the remote much anymore so my suggestion to someone with lesser experience - buy the card if you want excellent video capture / pvr abilities but buy windows media center OS if you want a media center pc. Overall I think the card is a winner!"
2,Hybrid,"The movie had a great start, the ending was really crappy. I think that it could of been done alot better."
3,"Not horrible, but not what it appears to be either","Length:: 6:31 MinsMy biggest problem with this movie would have to be the fact that an original mythology or idea is introduced at the beginning of the movie, then another is introduced in the latter half. Once the two storylines collide, the viewer begins to lose sense of the original plot and idea of the film, which makes it incredibly complicated to watch and digest when the original mythology is set.As I'll say in the review, the movie isn't bad, but it's not great either. I myself wish I hadn't bought it full price. As a reviewer, I'd recommend you rent the movie before you watch it. It'll ultimately save you a great deal of trouble (and frustration) when you come to find the story isn't what it seems to be."
1,Run as far from this as you can!,This should have been called 'Spot the Werewolf & win a prize' A Werewolf movie with no Werewolf. A lousy script. Justine Bateman was the only decent thing about it. If you see this DVD on the shelf - turn & walk quickly away.
2,What a waste of time!,"This movie started off on the right foot, with the whole eye transplant aspect. It had all the ingredients needed, but somewhere along the line, it's like the director decided to make an entirely different movie! Where are the WEREWOLVES?! I kept sitting there waiting for the lycan aspect to kick in and... NATHIN' . Oh well, I'll just pop my copy of Dog Soldiers in my DVD player ... now THAT'S a werewolf movie!"
1,This movie sucked ass,I watched it then sold it. Total waste of time and money. I would not recommend to anyone. This was probably one of the worst Maneaster movies I have seen.
3,Strange movie,"I enjoyed renting it, but I wouldn't purchase it. I truthfully watched it to see Cory Monteith in something other than Glee."
3,HyBrid,"I would to rate this a three because of the eye transplant.I dislike it because I am scaried of wolves but I like Cory Monteith as an Actor.I would like to consider to my friends, see if they like animals so much."
4,Really nice pictures and colors,"I know this book by heart. The best thing about it is the great, colorful pictures. Parents will be able to go above and beyond the simple story line to get their child involved in what's happening in the picture, as Elmo and Grover's grandad go for ice cream, listen to musicians, go to the zoo, etc. One caveat: Elmo doesn't ask his parents if it's okay to go somewhere with Grover's grandpa. Not a big deal, but not something to be glossed over in this day and age..."
5,Amazing!,"Criminally out of print, this is nominally a biography of Cortes, but the vast majority of this book focuses on his expedition. This is the kind of story that is too incredible to be fiction, it could only be the product of real people and real events. There are other versions of this tale of course, but this is among the best if you can get a hold of a copy. It is simply absurd that the book is no longer available new, but there are used copies floating around -- get one. This book will glue you to your chair."
2,No instructions,"I am not really sure about the effectiveness of the product as this was only one component of the thing that I was trying to hook up which did not work overall, however, I did want to comment that there are no installation instructions included so you had better know how to install it if you are going to buy it!!"
5,Anoited,"i was looking through my tape collection when I have ran accross this cd. I put it in my tape player and almost had an accident driving. This CD is full of God's sprit from the beginning until the end. It opens up with the Jazzy but churchy song Christ Did It All. Min. Kirvy Brown then takes the mike and makes everyone wants to make it to that city. Calling My name is a very emotional ballad led by Timothy Figruoe. It shows that even though we may fall millions of times, God is still calling and welcoming us back home. Sis. Monique Walker did no waste no time letting the anoiting fall on her on the song Let the Glory which she led previously on the Focus on Glory album. Even though the song is 13 minutes long, she does note bore you but when she is through singing that song, it will make you want to get up and shout. If you are a true Hezikiah Walker fan, this is the album for you."
5,Grammy Awarded Winning Live at Morehouse,"THIS IS MY FAV HEZ ALBUM, I LOVE EVERY LAST SONG, THE WHOLE ALBUM HAS GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF PLAYS ON MY MP3 PLAYER AND IM GLAD THET WON A GRAMMY FOR THIS HIS KEYBOARDIST IS AWESOME, EVEN THOUGH THEY DONT MAKE MUSIC LIKE THIS ANYMORE IM GLAD I HAVE THIS ALBUM, it its hos best work"
2,Rhino blows an easy one...,"This is the best of Warren Zevon? Okay, if you say so. I'll admit that MOST of his good stuff is here, but close doesn't count. Rhino usually does a fairly good job on their greatest hits packages, and Zevon would seem to be an easy candidate. But where is ""Sentimental Hygeine""? That song received plenty of airplay when released, and it even had a video on MTV. Forgotten? Ignored? Not by me! I'm certainly not saying this as a disgruntled fan whose particular odd favorite was not included - S.H. is one of his greatest and definitely should be here. Thumbs down for its omission, which makes the title of this CD misleading.Thumbs up on the sound, however - very clear and rich. And the booklet and liner notes are very entertaining. So there's two stars."
1,What about the missing pieces?,"As with many 'greatest hits' recordings, they have forgotten to include some of the artist's best work. DOH!Where is 'Mohammed's Radio' or 'Desperadoes Under The Eaves' and some other REAL greatest hits.. Why must the selection be based on accessability, radio favorites and some frankly lesser works?Another beef with this recording - the cover. We know Warren has a sense of humour (bless him!) but did he have artistic approval for this 'epitaph'?A little sensitivity in song selection and in cover art would do the record company some credit.Some well-informed Zevon 'nerds' should be brought in to put together a suitable tribute to the most talented 'nerd' of our times.May I be the first nerd in the queue to volunteer my services."
5,An excellent Zevon primer,"If you can recognize more than half the songs on this album, get ""I'll sleep when I'm dead"" instead. It's far more comprehensive. If you don't then you're in for a treat, and I envy your first listen to a collection of outstanding music."
3,Damning with faint praise...,"Warren was unique in that no matter how expansive a ""best of"" you put together, there was always going to be something left out that you could justifiably lobby for inclusion. ""Hula Hula Boys"", ""Worrier King"", ""Even A Dog Can Shake Hands"", ""Keep Me In Your Heart For A While""... his songs were a mirror. Whatever kind of person you are, there's a Zevon song to echo your own personal ethos. This disc is a fine introductory set but if it hits you where you live you should really start buying his catalog. Not everything's gold but your life will be enriched on a level surpassing the warm chuckle you got from ""Werewolves""... the most humanistic nihilist you'll ever come across. I feel like I'm not alone in the world mainly because of the work of people like Warren Zevon."
5,Rest In Peace,"Im Sorry to see that warren zevon just passed on recently, but hey thats what happens to people. The name of this Greatest Hits CD speaks for itself. If you have never heard this guy, your missing out on some of the greatest music ever written. Rest is peace Zevon. Your wisdom will truley be missed."
5,Alan D . Robertson,The CD is all I had hoped for as a review of Zevon's work for someone who has not really followed his career. It is a CD I will play over and over again !!!! For anyone who is a Zevon fan I can recommend it.
5,Genius is right!,"This is a great collection of WZ's work, all the best spanning his long career. Zevon is one of the best songwriter's to grace us with his music. Any fan of WZ or those who are interested in his work should own this collection. From the opening Poor Poor Pitiful Me to Genius from his last studio album and everywhere in between.I was a late comer to the party, but late is better than never. Genius aptly descibes the skill with which he weaves words into the stories and songs.Not to be Missed!"
5,Warren Zevon is a Treasure,"I don't think I have to convince a Zevon fan that this is worth having. However, if you are uninitiated, then get this. Learn to look at life with a cynical wink and know that you just may be a thorn looking for a side."
3,"good, but thick reading","This is an important topic, but this book is written in a research language type way, not an easy to read lay-person kind of way."
4,We Can't Teach What We Don't Know,I purchased the book for a class. The book has more application for gradeschool and highschool teachers.
2,"Important, yet Dense","This is a good read, Howard presents the issues well. It is thought provoking, and an important text (especially for people with no experience of other cultures). However, it could also have been 20 pages instead of 121 pages. There is a lot of repetition. Also the writing is dense, it seems like it was written for his colleagues.Two stars overall"
1,Poor quality binding,I received this book and got around to reading it about a month later. After I was about 50 pages in the binding gave out. The pages started falling out of the book. It was ridiculous. I didn't pay that much money for a textbook that I didn't even really want just to have it fall apart. I do not recommend buying this book solely for that reason.
1,It's all about gary,"I had the chance to meet the author during a conference to review this book and his work. I was looking forward to hearing about his approach for improving relationships between races. What a disappointment, we could even make it to the stage of having a trusting conversation. I felt my religious beliefs were under attack and he was not open to an honest and complete conversation.Gary Howard is not the spokes person for white males ... nor is he the spoke person for improving cultural relationships. He speaks for promoting himself and making money.... any another false prophet making a profit."
5,Every white educator should read this book,"The majority of teachers in today's increasingly diverse classrooms do not look like their students or share their life experiences. Until our hidden assumptions are made visible and until educators have the confidence to hold difficult conversations about race, class, culture and language with their students, we risk doing harm. Gary Howard offers a thought-provoking approach that challenges white teachers' assumptions and raises understanding of privilege without offending or blaming. The book provides useful strategies for addressing these issues. I would recommend it to all white teachers."
4,Praise for Howard!,"Gary Howard really exposed the truth behind why many of our schools are not successful in reaching the needs of all students. The chapter on ""Decoding the Dominance Paradigm"" was my favorite chapter."
2,Review of G. Howard's book,I did not care for this book. I did not care for the conclusions that Gary Howard drew from his experiences in the 60's. I thought the book was off center.
3,Historical Perspective on Racism,"The author spent the majority of the book relaying the historical background of races comparing non-white and white perspectives. In reading the book, I did find and begin to understand the assumptions (culture) of the white race and how it is perceived by other cultures. In this perspective the book had value. I was disappointed in that the author did not provide any depth or examples from a teacher's perspective of how best to adjust the white cultural perceptions to the multiracial classroom beyond being aware of the differences. This book is directed towards cultural awareness rather than a teacher's resource tool. Not necessarily recommended for those looking for the ""tools."""
4,A Journey of Reflective Practitioners,"We read Gary Howard's book as part of a class in advanced educational psychology. This particular book is written specifically for White educators but can be utilized by an educator or person of any racial or cultural background. The book encouraged us to go through journeys of personal transformation. It inspired us to question our own beliefs about diversity and to promote positive change within our classrooms and communities. We walked away feeling that we had many useful tools in our roles as teachers and individuals in a global community. As educators in multicultural classrooms, we need to consider the racial identity stages our students may be going through, as well as how thoughts, words, and actions can positively impact student success.We highly recommend this book as a means for individual growth, reflection, and open dialogue. You and your students will truly benefit!"
2,A little long-winded but contains nuggets of usefulness,"We read this book for a graduate class on teaching other cultures. While I was disappointed at the lack of practical applications of the book, it did help to open my eyes to the idea of White Dominance. There are factors of a white-dominated culture that are invisible to us whites, and Howard does a good job of bringing those to light.Much of the book is comprised of personal narratives, about Howard living in an economically-recessed area while attending Yale. It was then that he began to question his assumptions about racism, and the rest is history.I do, however, believe that he is using this book as a way of marketing his REACH center, which is an organization that trains teachers in cultural awareness, and also designs curricula for schools.Overall, this book is a good place to start when considering the implications and hazards of teaching other cultures, but just the book by itself does little to enlighten."
3,"Good ramp up, but...","Three stars just for the ""crazy uncle in the attic"" metaphor. I intend to borrow that one someday- it captures what I've been trying for years to articulate.The first two thirds of the book were interesting, though nothing you haven't heard elsewhere. Well, maybe not everyone was blessed with parents as enlightened as mine. That's the only explanation I can come up with.The last third of the book, which SHOULD have been practical How-Tos instead turned into diffuseness and academic word play. It was very disappointing after how direct the first part was.All authors claiming to teach me how to do something should first write a draft that lays out their proposals in point form. If you can't put it in point form, it's too academic. I want things I can take to a classroom."
2,Contemplating,This is not for ages 4-8 . My 6 year old didn't understand anything I was reading. It did not explain death to a young child. It did not have the answer to the question. It was more of an education on different customs and beliefs pertaining to death. I bought it to be prepared to explain death to my child in the event a loved one passed. When a loved one did pass a friend bought 2 books for my daughter. Both were very helpful. 1. The Fall of Freddie the Leaf 2. Waterbugs and Dragonflies: Explaining Death to Young Children
4,A good cognitive approach to the question,"When you are needing to explain the concept of death to a child, this is a book that will give you a good start on a difficult subject. The explanations regarding practices and customs of various religions and cultures are given in a factual, straightforward manner. When journeying through grief, children experience a wide range of feelings. This book provides a cognitive approach to death and does not touch on the emotive, feeling side. As usual, I recommend being familiar and somewhat comfortable with the content of the book before sharing with children."
3,"Oh, Angie...","Darnit. I had seen Angie and her sisters in classic 1960s Go Go in videos on youtube. They were great! HOWEVER... this is a different side of Angie, and I'm bummed. I'm somewhat of a prude, so classic 60s Go Go is just my speed... This is NOT classic Go Go. It has been ""updated"" for use in modern dance clubs. While it is slightly more conservative than other Go Go instructional DVDs out there, there is a substantial amount of raunchy grinding.That said, her teaching method is alright. great for a beginner. lots and lots of repetition and very nice explanations of the steps."
5,Really stuck with me.,"I read this wonderful book about a year ago, and I've thought back on it regularly since then. It's as beautiful and sad as it is educational. Even those of us who love nature often have trouble letting go of our human perspective on everything we see. This book helps to bring other perspectives into view: what might your world look like (and feel like) if you were a raccoon? A tree? A blade of grass? A microorganism? As you read, each living thing begins to seem more real, more substantial, and you realize that there is a universe of life even in a small plot of land. ""Hungry Hollow"" is also a rare combination of science fact and fictional narrative, so that the things you learn stick with you at an emotional level. The book deepened my understanding of the world, and I'm grateful."
2,Not totally convinced,"The book is ok in few parts, you have to appreciate the honesty and the straightforwardness used to describe the problem. And I like the references to God seen as someone who takes care of us no matter what (even if this does not mean not to take any action in our life because whatever happens is God's will and this seems to be the author's message, instead). However, I was disappointed to learn that the author sees as solution to the problem a lifetime abstinence. This is totally out of order and I think it's unhealthy, too. I once saw a very good nutrionist who told me that in this life we can eat anything, even a burger and chips from McDonald. What matter is self-control and a lifelong eating balance, not a lifelong eating abstinence. That's so wrong that I wonder how she managed to have her book published!! I mean, she did not even eat her wedding cake!! do you call this normal? nope, sorry, I don't agree with this approach. Thanks."
1,"Preachy, Unrealistic,","This book describes the harrowing ordeal of Debi, a compulsive overeater. She enters a clinic that offers a strict, 12-step approach to compulsive eating. It works well for Debi and she loses weight, becomes happy, and marries her sponsor's son.I felt uncomfortable with the approach she described in the clinic. ""Tough"" counselors yelling, screaming sessions where Debi vomits afterward, and one patient forced to wear a dress because she was uncomfortable being 'feminine'. It all seemed to be a preachy, Christian approach to a complex problem. Debi herself was forced to admit that she had had an abortion to her father. Why? Why was she forced to discuss this with her father? How did the counselors know that Debi would be physically and emotionally safe after this disclosure? (Debi describes this as ""killing"" her baby. Another preachy, Christian comment.)All in all, Debi comes across as a ""sinner"" who has ""converted"" and is now judging everyone who has not been ""saved""."
1,SIZE,I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BOUGHT THIS HAD IT SHOWN A SIZE! HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT SIZE YOU WILL GET>>>
3,"Useful to some, just not me...","I purchased this item shortly after getting my LG White Chocolate phone in order to protect it from damage and to have it on my belt when I needed it.Once I received it and put it on my phone, I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. The main reason being it makes the slide mechanism a little sticky because of the way the 2 halves of the carrying case slide together.It made my once elegant, simple phone look like a tank so I gave it to my wife, who used it for a couple weeks before growing tired of it.I purchased the case to protect my phone, but it changed the look and feel so much, I decided to take my chances without a case."
5,"""Often when you are the most hopeful, nothing works.""","Before reading The Long Lavender Look, I would have argued thatBright Orange for the Shroudwas the best Travis McGee book. After careful consideration, I have to admit that The Long Lavender Look steals the crown, even though they both remain extremely entertaining. Since MacDonald sets a high standard for hard-boiled detection, this should tell you that I liked this book very much indeed.McGee swerves to avoid a nearly naked girl running across the road, and ends up in a swamp of more than one kind. In order to clear his name, he has to find his way to the center of a secret at the heart of a small town Florida police department.Smart. Fair. Entertaining. Easy to find at used book stores for a small bit of change. What's not to like?"
2,a Scudder disappointment,"Not all of the Matthew Scudder crime novels are equal. This is oneis the least of the series.Matt may attend many AA meetings and have been able to stay sober, but he is basically a dry drunk. He does not work or live a good program. As we move through the pages we lose respectfor our detective friend. Block seems to lose the thread of thisstory, as we wander through Scudder's relationships with hisarray of offbeat characters. They are interesting in themselves,but lend little to the storyline. Block decides he must finish thisbook somehow and gives us such a lame ending. I wanted tohave a deeper understanding of Holtzmann's nefarious dealings. After trailingthis man for so many pages only to have him shot as a mistakenidentity. Oh please. I have a few more to read in this series, I hopethe last few are better than this, they would almost have to be."
2,GREAT Artwork--Less than stellar music,"There were two reasons I purchased this CD: 1) The artwork and, 2) the song selection (Especially ""Drunken Spree""). The truth is, I can't sit through this disc. The original recordings of these songs are miles beyond what you'll hear on the Blues Goblins disc (and I knew they would be, but there's always a slim chance that someone will do the re-make justice). So, I'll continue to enjoy the picture of the angry, red, gorilla head on the cover, and keep the CD where it belongs--in the case."
4,Future teacher Review,"I would recommend this software for students with special needs, since it caters to varying modalities and learning styles. The program is adaptable in the time alloted for various tasks, as well as difficulty levels. The software works better on a mac, just something to be keen of. Overall I would recommend this software to future educators and parents."
5,Fabulous book - My daughter loved it!,"My daughter and I went on a camping trip together this summer and I thought it'd be fun if we read a book aloud to each other. A friend recommended this book and I am so glad we took it along in the backpack! I liked the characters - they aren't perfect which makes them relatable. I cared about what happened to them. My daughter loved the main character and rolled her eyes whenever I said, ""See?"" to the character not listening to the adults in her life. It was full of suspense which made it hard to put it down each night. This book gave my daughter and I something to talk about over the campfire - thank you to my friend for recommending it to us!"
5,Ezquisite blending of technique and soul.,"A tremendous outpouring of infectious synchopation and melodies that bring out what is truly music to sooth the savage breasts. Chucho pays homage to both his father and his motherland .His co- conspiritors on this assualt to the senses are equally founded in technique and spirit. With General Chucho leading the assualt, its no wonder that all territories of one's sensese are conquered. Bravo, Chucho! You have conquered! . Chucho and his music may be from Cuba, but they belong to the world!"
1,dissapointed album,"I'm trying to understand the Chucho Valdes performing philosophy,he hurting his own talent playing piano every time he want to ""florear"" the song his playing,is frustating try to listen him,if you like to listen real melody of any kind of latin jazz,this is not the CD to buy,FG."
5,Very prompt,I received my replacemnt covers right away and they fit perfect!! I'm very much satisfied with them.
1,Does not work,"ITem is unable to create a vaccuum or seal plastic bags... customer service was surprised that I had bought it since I live at 7,500 feet, indicating that I needed special instructions which they sent by email. After buying a special screw driver with particular size star tip, and making the adjustments they said I needed to do, it still does not work. They said they would take it for repairs, but $25 for shipping across country is unacceptable. Avoid this unit."
2,Disappointed with these CD series...,"There isn't one single song from the 1977 classic ""The Rescuers"" included in this collection, I don't see why Disney chose not to include any of those songs which are all gorgeous, when they did include unmemorable and weak songs instead, I've seen these CD's with songs that aren't half as good as ""Tomorrow is Another Day,"" ""The Journey,"" ""Someone's Waiting for You"" or ""Rescue Aid Society.""Very disappointing, The Rescuers is a fine Disney classic and it should be included with all of the others."
5,a fun CD covering Disney's long history,"This CD cannot, of course, cover all of Disney's history .... but they do a very nice job of sampling it.From the vintage (Mickey Mouse Theme Song, Burl Ives' Ugly Bug Ball) to the classic (selections from Bambi, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Peter Pan, and Cinderella) to the more recent (Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Lion King), these are the songs performed by the original artists. They bring back a flood of memories for young and old alike.The booklet is sparse, but does give credit to the composer, lyricist, performers and producers of each of the twenty-five songs.Very upbeat. A nice value."
5,This is an awesome album!,"This album is great because it has many songs that everyone in the family can agree upon. Like most teens, my parents aren't too thrilled with what i usually listen to, but with Classic Disney we all sing along while i remember movies from when I was younger, like The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, and my parents remember some of their old favorites, like The Parent Trap and originally seeing Peter Pan. This is a must-have for anyone who loves Disney movies and wants to share the songs with their kids or little brothers and sisters."
5,A cd of wonderful songs.!,I had this Cd years ago when my children were young. We loved singing along with our fave disney songs while riding in the car. It made car trips a lot more pleasant. I bought this cd for christmas presents for my grand children. They love the songs as much as their parents did. My children said listening to these songs brings back great memories.. I would recommend this Cd to everyone! Volume 2 is also recommended.
5,Don't Study more -- study more efficiently,"I used the first edition of this book a million years ago and found it's advise indispensible. So, too, is the advice offered in this second edition. If you are an adult going back to school I highly recommend you take a peek at this first. Although it appears to be written for high school students, it is just as applicable to adults. However, if you prefer a more adult-centered book, buy Dr. Green's first edition. It is geared SPECIFICALLY towards working adults going back to school."
2,common sense.,"There is nothing special about his method of studying. I mean his method is the basic method of learning. If you don't even know the basic method, you will never do good at school nor college.by the way, if you buy this book(it's cheap $1-3)or borrow in library, don't waste your time reading the story and the contents, just read the heading and go straight to ""recap."""
2,problems,"Immediately after installing 2 of these belts and running the sander, they came apart at the joint. This was before even sanding. The next belt started and finished the wood project. A fluke?"
2,Professor review--don't assign this text to your students,"As a prof, I was happy to assign this book. After all, I loved Robbins'Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism (4th Edition)(a fabulous book), and I needed a basic anthro text to provide basics. And, indeed, many basic anthropological themes are offered. However, the organization and style of presentation are terribly awkward. The book is more or less ruined by a question and answer format. The text is boring to read, and difficult to work with. I found it very difficult to integrate into my course. Say, for example, I wanted to work with kinship... the book's strange splicing of the subject, teamed with its fumbled questions, left me flummoxed. I will continue to look for Robbins work, but I will never assign this book again."
1,would help if recieved,"I'm sure the book was a great help for those who actually got their copy, my seller never sent the book and i'm still trying to get my money bacy"
5,"Dewdy, Cheatem, & Howe","A must for every attorney on your gift list. Perfect for almost any occasion, assuming the person being gifted has a sense of humor."
1,Unneccesary,This is an unneccessary addition to the Wild Truth book. It's just a way to make an extra profit off of a so-so book. I wouldn't recommend buying this if you're on a limited church budget.
2,works but cant make chick-fil-a style waffle fries,the wave of the ripple is not large enough to make thick waffle fries like they have at chick-fil-a or carls jr.
5,This will slice anything!!!,"I wanted a wavy slicer mainly for taking off half the cucumber rind and this does it just perfectly. It slices through everything with ease and the thickness adjustment facility makes it more versatile. BEWARE - this is VERY SHARP and I took a nice v wedge out of my thumb just while playing around and testing it out. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, very sturdy construction but do watch your fingers. Guard probably the best way to go."
2,1st is to small for a waffle cut 2nd step is to large for a wffle cut,this product did not work for me I should of returned it. The first step is to small for waffle cut that I make and the second step does not make a waffle cut. That was the main reason I bought it.
5,Well protect and gentally care,"Actually, washing hair everyday will dry out the head skin and generate some scurf owing to my dry type skin. Sebamed kind of moisture my head skin and prevent the scurf, so I love it."
1,Not Worth Buying,I bought this book thinking that I was going to get an extensive commentary about Alice In Wonderland. This book is by no means an in-depth commentary on the piece. There are no more than ten pages of commentary in the whole book. The rest of the book is just the actual text of Alice In Wonderland with large side-margins that occasionally include definitions of words or phrases.Definitely one of the worst book purchases I have made in the last few years...
1,save your pennies,This was a waste of pennies as there is very little that Cliff Notes can tell you beyond the text or book. It really IS that simple!
2,"We just don't get invited to the same potlucks, I guess","The biggest challenge of the potlucks I go to is that there's usually no way to re-heat your food. Hauling a piping-hot dish from home often isn't an option, either. And I can only make so many quiches, you know? So I keep buying potluck cookbooks, hoping to find recipes for things--particularly main dishes or other savories--that are good served at room temperature. I'm still looking, because this ain't it, either. This one is worse than most, in fact--a collection of not-very-interesting recipes, and nothing I can really take as a main dish to my office, or to a party right after work."
5,Great Reading!!!,This is a great cookbook and also a book you can enjoy simply by reading it. I bet you can't read it without trying a recipe!!
5,MY GOD WHAT A BLESSING,"MY GOD WHAT A BLESSING . THIS IS PROBABLY ALBERTINA AT HER BEST . THIS ALBUM FEATURES HER ALL STAR GIRL GROUP THE ""CARAVANS"" .

2,"Essential reading for those interested in Indian Removal policy, but this edition has some flaws.","This is a classical historical work by U.B. Phillips on the issue of Indian Removal and is a must read for those interested in a more detailed academic understanding of the issue. The problem with this edition is a very annoying one and it has to do with the printing and layout. The edition has been created using optical scanning of an original book that translates the original text into its current format. The problem here is that they clearly did not do any editing or try to correct layout issues. The result is a book where the original footnotes have become incorporated into the body of the text, which makes it extremely difficult to read. It also results in other layout and typographical errors that are glaring and problematic. My advice is to spend the extra cash to get a better original edition of some sort because this book is tough enough to read without trying to decipher the screwed up layout."
4,Underrated Gem,"I first watched this movie in the mid-90's at the suggestion of a video store clerk. My one thought when I was done was ""Why hadn't I heard of this before?"" I recently rented it again to show my highly sceptical wife. She loved it and forced her parents to watch it. We're now 4 for 4 in our family!This movie sets up a great situation and then does a good job playing out all the threads with its major themes, particularly the preconceptions of the supposedly 'liberal' neighbors. Cage and Jackson play their parts well (and play off of each other well).Dabney Coleman plays his basic mean-[jerk] role and does it well. The supporting cast is all good. If you don't laugh, you're taking yourself too seriously."
2,pretty dull comedy,"This isn't a BAD movie, but it's not that great either. The whole situation with Samuel Jackson being mistaken for a thief while moving into his house due to the prejudices of the community starts out the film with some decent humor, but once the addition of real crook Nicolas Cage comes in to do cleanup for the chief the story just feels sloppy. Cage and Jackson are A+ as always, really good acting and tremendous fun watching them interact, but it's just not that well written. It could have been much better, but as it is, it is merely okay, having been saved by the great tension and chemistry between Jackson and Cage."
2,Amos and Andrew,"I've remember seeing the poster in a video store way back when and i've always wanted to watch it, not knowing what it was even about. I'll give you a brief run down of the filmA man moves into a racist, island community. I say racist because a couple calls the cops when a black man moves in, thinking he is stealing the home. The police straight (acting straight from a police academy movie) and they shoot up the guy's house and realize there mistake after a few minutes. They got a camera crew filming the entire event. They get an ex-con to come in and make it look like a hostage sitution, in return for his freedom. The two bond and well this movie is just plain flat. Everything is predictable and while the acting is not bad, it's far from either mans best role. I don't recommend it too anyone. It's not like anyone remembers it anyways."
2,Maybe they should have asked Ted and Alice along too...,"Amos & Andrew (1993) The first film directed by writer Max Frye (Something Wild) is sadly a rather tepid message movie/comedy about a black writer (Samuel L. Jackson-Pulp Fiction) who moves onto an island community in New England that is all white. Thereafter, through a complicated set of circumstances, he is shot at, held hostage, etc. all because of the island people's innate prejudices. Nicolas Cage (Honeymoon in Vegas) is Amos Odell, a two-bit criminal enlisted by the island's police chief (Dabney Coleman-Short Time) to help him save face before the next election. It's all overly intricate, and whatever chances the film had at comedy are smothered by the heavy-handed social statements. To top everything else off, a very good supporting cast is given little to do. Also with Brad Dourif (Spontaneous Combustion), Michael Lerner (Barton Fink), and Margaret Colin (Like Father, Like Son)."
1,very weak film,another stereotype film that is dumb&forgettable.Nicholas Cage is a alright actor at times.Samuel Jackson is one of the best actors today in Hollywood but this film is bland.stay away.
4,still a laugh with old flick,"nick has more hair & sam is young but still powerful actor. we see a white islandbeing block busted by famous black man, who is un known to residents. call a copwho wants to be more than top cop & use nick to climb up. nick & sam join together to defeat cop & rich whites in the game with some laughs along the way."
5,Sensation Dead sea Intensive Foot Treatment,"My husband and I have both been very satisfied with this foot treatment. We use twice daily. Makes our feet tingly warm. We both like the fragrance, too."
5,The Final Fracas,"This is the story of Mack Reynolds corporate war hero: Joe Mauser. It combines and adds to two previous novellas ""Mercenary"" and ""Frigid Fracas"". In the progressive state of Mr. Reynolds future, corporations settle business disputes by reverting back to trial by combat. War becomes the ultimate means to an end. To any Mack Reynolds fan that has enjoyed the novellas in the past this book completes the character of Joe Mauser. An interesting yet daunting possibility of the ultimate extreme televisized competition."
3,"No ""Blue Turning Grey Over You""??","Just don't get it and that's the reason for the 3 stars. I just hope a Part II album comes out soon for this artist that includes all her best tracks. Please please. I'm waiting. Hopefully it will include the above mentioned, as well as ""I've Got Five Dollars"" and ""Mood Indigo."""
1,Cheap Chinese Knock-off Part,"I was very disappointed with the merchandise I received. Instead of an OEM filter, I received a very cheap, flimsy, made-in-China imitation part. I will not do business with this merchant again; when I order a Tecumseh filter, I expect a Tecumseh filter, not a Chinese knock-off."
2,Cant Really Rate,"Unfortunately I cant review the 'Cables To Go"" brand cable as its NOT the brand cable I received (see vendor review). The cable I got works but was not the one I paid for."
2,Tough to set up,"It writes music perfectly, but for some reason I haven't been able to get it to write any sort of executeable file without the file being unreadable."
4,awesome ambient ethnic aproach,"For further info check out my review on part one. This is an excellent namlook, laswell disc. Laswell had just gotten some ehtnic elements on dat and the recording process for this album began but unknown to laswell at the time he had contracted a virus, and african virus. They described it as very strange and it slowed down the entire fax machine label down. The virus was different and ever changing, thus thats the process they chose for the album. Beats on and off. Very ambient except #3 is very ethnic electronic awesome unlike no other laswell namlook before. Then # 5 has a percussion instrument throught the ambience. Give it a change any ambient ethnic fans will love or just namlook, laswell heads"
3,Average,"I saw this film last night. I'm on a streak where I watch every Clint Eastwood movie out there. There is quite some crime scene on this one. However, I don't think I will be recommending this movie to anyone. I really couldn't understand why Costner was as hard on the black family as he was. I may lack knowledge on criminals. I dont recommend this movie to anyone unless you must see every Clint Eastwood film made. I recommend ""Absolute Power"" instead of ""A Perfect World""Rating - 2.5 Stars"
5,ooooooooooooooooooooooooooh yyyyyeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaah,"this is hands down thee best kevin costner movie, get it or you suck, also check out paper moon."
5,Great movie,"Despite the what the others say, this really is a great movie. I understand why the others on here are angry but they really don't comment on how great of a story this is. The ending made my Mom cry when she saw it. Eastwood gives a good performance and I persoanlly think is Costner's best performance. Which is a break for him because he hasn't acted in any good movies besides maybe Field Of Dreams."
5,"Very, very touching movie","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It tells us so much about the world, about what is good and evil. The world is a better place when you have someone like Butch, Red and Sally. Their warm hearts give us hope. On the other hand, many are selfish, indifferent and even cold-blooded, like the guy who works for the government. I do not understand how can anyone be so cold-blooded. I wish the end could be different. I really do. A warm ending would be less dramatic and probably would not make sense. But it does make you feel a hell lot better and no need to work hard to hold back your tears. I hope everyone who watches this movie has someone like Butch in your life. May God bless us all."
3,Clint Should Have Done His Research,"The acting is really good in this movie, but I could not get away from how the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses were depicted so badly! Being a former Jehovah's Witness, I know that they do not believe in Hell, so the boy in the movie would not have been worried about going there if he celebrated Halloween. Other than that, it is a good movie."
4,COSTNER AND EASTWOOD ARE FANTASTIC,"I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood as a director. He is one of the few directors working today who has mastered the use of subtlety. In two of my favorites (Unforgiven and Absolute Power) he commands ensembles of actors with ease and still maintains his use of small camera movements and letting the characters small moments tell the story. However I think he out does himself with A Perfect World. The slow and sure pacing of a master director combined with a moving story and three of the best performances around. The young boy, Costner, and Eastwood are all fabulous. This is a powerfully moving story of missed chances and father/son regret. However I won't lie, the film has one fatal flaw: Laura Dern is awful. If only they had simply written her out completely this would have been a perfect film. But if you can put her minor role aside this a great film worthy of your viewing."
5,Costner and Clint Team Up For Masterpiece I'd Never Heard Of Til Now,"That about sums it up. Perfect settings - the Texas LE community. That is, perfect for an explication of just how effed up our entire criminal justice system is. Gulag would be kind. And in a culture whose core value of original sin, perpetration just keeps gettin' the upper hand, delivered more and more, by the 'justice' system itself. Like Agamemnon, unless we change our notion of biblical and wrathful vengeance, we are doomed."
3,"Costner Primary, Eastwood Seconary","Kevin Costner is the star of this watchable chase flick. Costner plays Butch a prison escapeè who kidnaps a child and takes to the road. Eastwood plays the Marshal sent to bring him in. Eastwood directed the watchable movie that changes the genre around. Usually the movie centres on the police, this one centres on the criminal who isas bad as he wants to be."
2,Watching this movie was a waste of time.,"I just watched A Perfect World for the first time, and I'm not impressed. The violence is too intense and disturbing. Watching it gave me a bad feeling. A lot of the storylines are not very believable either. It's hard to believe that an escaped convict could go undetected for as long as Butch Haynes did. He was always around people who were listening to newscasts about him, and once he was even in the car with a family who went through a road block. And killing his friend just for being mean to the little boy is going to unbelievable extremes. The storylines where he wants the little boy Phillip, whom he is holding hostage, to enjoy Halloween are also weak. The only salvation for this movie are the compelling performances by Kevin Costner and the little boy who plays Phillip. I can think of a lot of other movies I would rather watch or recommend for others to watch."
2,"Below average, a few disturbances","OK...were to start. I didn't recommend this to my fiance and her sister to watch. The scene at the farmer's house before the ending was way too disturbing. It was unbelievable that the film-makers included several instances of child abuse and neglect near the end of the movie (the kid, Cleveland didn't seem to do anything wrong to deserve to be bashed like that by his father). The man played by Costner cared for his kidnapee, but had to be negligant at times to people to avoid being detained by the cops (i.e. stealing a Stationwagon from a family, allowing the kid to steal a costume from a store, being tyrannical enough to duct tape a family that gave them one day of ""kind hospitality""). The movie had some decent moments to it, but it was too disturbing to watch. On the positive side...Clint Eastwood did a great role in the movie.I don't believe that Jehova's Witnesses is a true religon. I believe that Christianity is the only true religion."
5,Comprehensive,"The book discusses in great detail all the important stock market ratios and indicators and many of the lesser ones. It expounds on many styles and strategies to buying and selling stocks, including active trading strategies, value investing, technical analysis and fundamental analysis. The problem I have with exposing the beginner to strategies such as active trading is that research has shown that it is futile and will result in a loss for nearly all traders after trading expenses (You are up against thousands of MBA graduates who will stay up later then you and get up earlier then you ). I believe the downside of each strategy should be explained and who has been successful using it, so that the beginner has an idea of what he is up against. That being said, there is tremendous value in the book because of its detailed explanation of how to analyze company reports, what the valuation indicators mean (ie, p/e) and how to use them."
5,Excellent,"I purchased and read this book after having seen Steven Spielberg's movie ""Munich"" and I am glad I did it in that order. While reading the book I could picture many of the scenes from the movie which helped keep all the names and characters straight. A sad, enthralling story - I could not put it down."
4,Striking Back: The 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre and Israel's Deadly Response,"A very compelling read that goes hand in hand with Steven Spielberg's film ""Munich."" The book revealed new details I had not seen, despite extensive reading on the history of these events."
2,Striking Out,"""Striking Back"" is an incoherent and repetitive description of various assassinations carried out by Israeli military and intelligence authorities in the wake of the killing of Israeli athletes and coaches at the 1972 Olympics. The author's research might be impressive -- he implies that much of the material in the book was never publicly stated before -- but he has no ability to present it in an interesting way.The chapters are short, and most of them cover one assassination. They all start to sound alike after a while. And there's little context to them. If you already know a lot about Israeli politics and history, perhaps the book is more meaningful. But I doubt it, as it's far from a sophisticated book. It's definitely aimed at the casual reader about the modern Middle East.The author tries to make some assessment of the value of assassinations as a strategy, but he doesn't do enough on that account, either."
2,Dry and Witless,"Yes, I understand this is not a novel, but it is as dryly written as a computer manual. It's a shame because the story is compelling, true and quite dynamic."
4,Fine Collection of the roots of Reggae,"This album, though not as good as the next 2 discs in the series, is still an excellent collection of old-school ska, reggae, dancehall, and rocksteady. Each track will get you skankin'. I highly recommend this as well as the 200% and 300% Dynamite albums. Happy listening."
4,"Content high, binding low","Satie's work has always fascinated me. Playfulness, melancholy, and simplicity - and always easy to recognize. The scoring is, to my not expert ear, very well done and easy to read. I would rate this 5 stars were it not for the deplorable predilection of print music publishers to bind books such that they do not open and lay flat on the piano without breaking the binding. Music is to be played first and last and not, at least not for old fogies like me, just read."
4,Just what I wanted.,"It is almost perfect, it has Satie's more famous pieces, the only thing I did not like was that it does NOT have the Gnossienne N 4, 5 and 6... it has the 3 first Gnossiennes though.Very satisfied with this..."
1,Oops!,If you are smart enough to read and understand the complex ideas that Willard presents -- and some of them are quite provocative -- then you don't need this study guide. It is almost insultingly immature. A group or individual is really missing out on the depth of this fabulous book by using this study guide.Dump it and think for yourself!
4,Useful,"Useful but expensive. A whole Borner set, used, is about twice the cost of this one piece, on Ebay. Don't know what happened to my original safety holder, but it is a necessary item as I found out the hard way."
4,no more cuts,ok good no more cuts on kly hands when I gratelittle big but ir does itsw job nice color
2,This feels unstable to use,"I bought this with a crinkle cut slicer to use on potatoes and sweet potatoes. I find it very ungainly for those hard vegetables and have gone back to cutting vegetables without protection. I try to be careful but you cannot cook without getting cut and burned once in a while.I may pick up a pair of cut resistant gloves if I see any that get good reviews but, until that, I am going commando."
5,This handle has brought back life to my old equipment again.,Great replacements for the original holding handle to an old v-slicer. After more than twenty years of service it was nice to find a replacement for the handle to my v-slicer once it broke.
4,Great item!,"It is a little hard to get the small pieces of something into the slicer, but besides that, I really enjoy it. You should know that the slicer comes with one of these, so you don't need to buy it unless you lost your! I wish I had known that...I have 2..."
5,Does what is says,It does what it says and is it worth the money YES! You will not be sorry because accidents do happen and you don't want to wait for that day to come so why risk it?
2,unwieldy,I find this holder very difficult to use. It does not hold food securely nor is it comfortable to grip if you have small hands. The design--at least when used with the v-slicer--does not allow you to slice most items all the way through.I would look for a different safety holder or try a steel mesh glove instead.
5,Great lens :),Great lens for low light shooting. I use it mainly for indoor shots. Better option than the Pentax 16-50 2.8 if you're on a budget.
5,Daily Inspiration,"This is the kind of book that never makes it to my bookshelf because I use it every day. It has become a daily source of inspiration to me to guide me to reaching my highest potential. I am always surprised at how accurate each message is for me. I'm sure that like me, you won't be able to go through a day without seeking guidence from these messages."
5,Exactly what I needed,Exactly what I needed and more than I expected. It is very intuitive and seems like a quality item. It handled my 4 gauge wire quite easily. I had Knuconcepts 4 ga power wire and it is one of the larger 4 gauge wires. The DB link came with bushings to accommodate smaller guage\diameter wires. I felt confident this will hold up quite well. I am planning on buying 2 more.
3,Good book based on true story,"This book is based upon a true story of a homosexual man who was kicked out of the house at a young age and learned how to survive by stealing identities. For those who are homophobic, this is not the book for you, but otherwise, it tells a great story of how crazy identity theft was when this story took place, decades ago. Some things have improved but overall it is still a big problem. This might help you learn how to protect yourself."
3,Great Poems/Lousy Copy,"The poems of this book are wonderful, as are all of the author's writings. But this particular edition looks as if someone has simply zeroxed a copy of the original edition (and it isn't even a very nice copy). I would suggest buying this one used rather than this version."
5,"Very good, technical treatise","This is an excellent effort to apply Zen understandings to Christ's teachings. The Zen in Leong's book is fairly technical; I'm not sure that readers without a deep knowledge of it would understand the points he's making. But his take on the Gospels is thunderous. Any Zen student who walks away from this work untouched by a deep respect for the teachings of Jesus is, in my opinion, overly attached to religious labels.[...]"
5,Great Rockabilly,"Brian is a great talent, not only as a Rockabilly Artist, but his self penned songs are the greatest also."
5,The Life and Times of General Montgomery C. Meigs,"David Miller deserves a great deal of credit for bringingGeneral Montgomery Meigs to life. Through his incredibly detailed work, the life and times of this gifted builder,architect and general become chrystallized in the reader's mind.The number of personal letters included in this volume are nothing short of remarkable. The inclusion of so many portions of personal letters from the mid-1800s allows the reader to share directly the thought processes of Meigs, his supporters and his detractors. The copious footnotes are outstanding as well. Not to mention the great photos.In a sense, this is a textbook as well as a biographical work.I am very impressed. Thank you,!!!Signed, A distant relative of the Quartermaster General"
5,Solid First CD,Shame on Amazon not to have more of We are Catfish in Stock - it is the best debut album ever!
1,"Uncomfortable, hollow sound","I bought these because of the folding feature they offer. They are about the samller over ear headphones available because they fold, but beyond that they have almost nothing to offer over similarly priced headphones. They're very uncomfortable; they fit on your ear instead of over them which becomes extraordinarily uncomfortable after only a half hour with them on. In addition, they make my ears sweat whereas other closed ear headphones do not. All of this would be tolerable if they produced decent sound, but they do not. Get the Koss PortaPro instead and you won't be sorry."
5,Great music,My son bought this CD and had me listen to it. It brought back great high school memories! Love the music and so glad my son turned me on to where to buy this this. Crazy that my son is listening to music I did in high school!! Arrived earlier than expected and it good condition!
5,The Definitive Version Of Harry Nilsson's Definitive Album,"This 2004 remaster is the definitive verson of NILSSON SCHMILSSON, Harry Nilsson's definitive album. In addition to the original album, which includes affecting balladry (a cover of Badfinger's ""Without You""), loopy humor (the tropically-flavored ""Coconut""), and straight-out rock & roll (""Jump Into The Fire""), this CD contains six bonus cuts which actually add to the worthiness of the album. The homey feel of this album, unique in an era known for bombast, makes NILSSON SCHMILSSON the place to start your Harry Nilsson collection."
4,"The Late Great ""Schmilson""","Harry was a lyrical genius no doubt. Between ""a Little Schmilson in the Night"" and Nilsson Schmilson, the latter shows a true artist at his craft. I just started listening to him with his song ""without you"" (actually not even his song! But his other works such as Coconuts shows how inventive he was just with a few lines that can make you listen to it over and over again without ever getting tired. Hey, if the Beatles dug him, you can't go wrong."
5,Gotta Get It!,"OK - This is it! For all you ""Harry"" freaks out there, this a gotta have album! Wonderfully remastered and the bonus tracks are great, esp. ""Old Forgotten Soldier."" Harry was a prophet of the times to come. And don't forget to listen to ALL of track sixteen - the demo version of ""Gotta Get Up"". And last but by no means least are the wonderful liner notes - a little booklet in interview format with pictures. Notes contain factoids that you didn't know about. Like, what happened to the writers of ""Without You"" (changes the meaning of the song!) and the photographic details about the album cover-shoot. Only thing missing is the poster of Harry that came with the original vinyl release!"
5,Nilsson's best,"This is a great CD. The extra tracks don't add much for me, but they give you the early development of the tracks."
1,"Sound Engineer misses boat, sounds as if recorded in garage","There are few musical dynamics brought froward by the Trident Studio where this was recorded by Robin Geoffrey Cable (Sound Engineer). The Analog to Digital is not good, Nilsson sounds as if he is at the back of the sound stage and the engineer is using compression technology to drown-out all dynamics, be prepared to turn up the volume on this one. I was real disappointed!"
2,"No ""Remaster"" for me thank you",I have to agree with Gordon Pfannenstiel. After listening to the samples to this remastered CD I was appalled at the way the orchestration was pumped up over Nilsson's amazing vocals. I passed on this product and was glad that the original CD was available for MP3 download.
5,Nilsson's Best,"_Nilsson Schmilsson_ is Harry Nilsson's best-selling, and best received album. It features Harry's hits ""Without You"" and ""Coconut"" as well as classics such as ""The Moonbeam Song"" and ""Jump Into the Fire."" With eight bonus tracks - demo versions of songs recorded during the _Nilsson Schmilsson_ session - this CD is a ""must have!"""
5,Start your Nilsson journey here.,"As a recent discoverer of Harry Nilsson I am hurridly finding and buying every CD I see. I wish I could buy this album again and experience it for the first time once more. From the opening piano of 'Gotta Get Up' to the beautiful last chords of 'I'll Never Leave You' there isn't much not to like about this classic record. I'm proud to introduce this album on anyone who will listen. It's a must have for any music lover's CD collection.By the way, the Camden import sounds awful. It says it's remastered. If that's true the mastering engineer must have, for medical purposes I'm sure, downed a gallon of whiskey before he started. Notice his name isn't included in the liner notes. Hmmm! The bonus tracks sound good but the bulk of the album was sourced from bad, high generation tapes. I have a copy of the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs CD and it's wonderful."
5,The lost Beatle?,"Harry Nilsson has only put out a handful of lp's in the 70's. They all were skillfully crafted. His masterpiece (Nilsson Schmilsson) was done and he was on the money with every song. Without You,Coconut and Jump into The Fire were top 10 playlist songs. But every song has stood the test of time. He could have been the 5th Beatle without any questions. Just listen to any songs on this lp and enjoy his outstanding song writing skills. Many of these songs have been used as soundtracks for many movies. His backup artists are like a who's who in the music biz.Great lp just give it a spin in the CD player and enjoy!"
3,leslolamac,"Unfortunately, Harry Nilsson's life story is more interesting than his music. See the documentary ""Who is Harry Nilsson,"" but skip the disc."
3,dino tracks,"This game has great potential; the version we got is backwards which is confusing to my kids. For example, the directions say yellow represents thousands, blue hundreds, green tens etc but it's obviously opposite, so a serious flaw in the actual production of the game. We just changed it as we played but it's a drag. My son (7) loves it though."
4,Fun (math) Toy,"This is fun for my 8 year old. Good concept and she is learning without even knowing she is doing math. An overall winner. Different levels allow for advancement extending the amount of time this game is useful for leaning. Good investement.Board and dinos are durable and good quality.Board footprints are close together and get crowded. Sometimes it is confusing to know what line to follow, expecially when there is a showdown.Card stock thin but not unlike many other board games sold.I bought this because of the math factor and was pleased that it is also fun for the whole family."
4,interesting and fun!,"We just got this game to help reinforce the concept of larger numbers for our 5 year old. We have only played it once so far, but we all had fun, and I think she made progress with her numbers just in that one game! The colorful dinosaurs are cute. There are also a couple of parts that are just for fun, like the showdown. We only played with the first 3 dice - to make a 3 digit number instead of a 4 digit number. It's great because you can customize it for your child."
5,good value,"My daughter is age 6 in 1st grade. We just started playing the game and so we are starting with using 3 dice instead of 4. I love how this game has different ways to play as they get older and understand place value more. We are just at the very beginning level so I look forward to showing her more as she gets older. The plastic dinosaur pieces are great and she loves the ""HUGE"" dice. That alone caught her attention right away. The board is colorful and sturdy also."
2,Usually a big Learning Resources fan......,"I love Learning Resources games but not this one. Game board is too crowded. Little fingers are always knocking down the dinos. Sure my daughter can now ""read"" a four digit number correctly but has no concept of how much bigger a 1,000 is vs 100. I was surprised because we have always LOVED our other Learning Resources games. My daughter love, love, loves Money Bags and Sum Swamp."
2,Not the songs in the movie,"I bought this to hopefully hear some of the songs in the movie. Especially the one when they are steppin/dancing. Unfortunately I only recognized a couple of songs from the movie. Not sure where the rest were. Most notably the Trick Daddy/Ozzy mix - ""Let's Go"", which was in the previews and the movie was not even on the soundtrack. The best thing I can say is it is clean enough to let my kids put on their ipods."
3,Halloween havoc 94,"halloween havoc 94 from detroit michigan.has a good not great world title match with hogan and flair and a good boss vs vader match.but the rest is bad johnny b badd vs honky tonk man,nasty boys vs funk,bunkhouse buck.watch the main event for historical value only."
3,A decent PPV with a classic Main Event.,"Halloween Havoc 1994 on October 25 from the Joe Louis Arena featured the steel cage battle between icons Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair for the World Title. This was about as a great a match as there can be. The rest of the card wasn't great, but it was not boring. The Hogan-Flair match is the crowning jewel of halloween Havoc 1994."
3,Thrilling main event but so-so undercard,The Hogan vs. Flair main event is a very good and exciting one. Although the rest of the matches are not quite up to pay per view quality. However overall the pay per view is pretty good.
3,Flair and Martel save it from Stinkville!,"The Ric Flair/Hogan match is all that makes this video worthwhile. Besides getting a chance to see Flair show off his considerable talents, you get an exceptional view of Sherry Martel's lovely backside repeatedly. Otherwise, this tape is as boring as they come."
3,O.K.,The only thing good about this tape is that Ric Flair is init. [Hogan] He doesn't deserve to be in the same ring with Flair. I can't believe Flair agreed to let him win this one. The undercard was descent. The beginning of the Hogan era in WCW killed their promotion.
4,Excellent account,"Of an often overlooked battle in American history. Technical and personal account at the same time, creating good picture of the battle."
4,"Good book, if u can pardon the typos!","Very good book for the certification exams, and covers just what is required for the exams. But the number of typos needs a very good proof reader and the CD never works."
1,Too many errors to justify my time,"After completing only two chapters I have become so frustrated with typos and scripts from the CD that don't run, I would put this book on the shelf if there was another option or I could live without learning this technology immediately.The book was not accurately updated for the new version of DB2 - as evidenced by the CD installation instructions that reference version 1.x and include install instructions for directories that no longer exist on the CD!"
3,Mainly for DBA's,"The coverage of UDB database analyst functionality is its strength. You don't want to learn SQL syntax nor SQL programming from this text (read ""A Complete Guide to DB2 Universal Database"" by Don Chamberlin). I found the typos, text that doesn't agree with the figures, and incorrect answer keys, extremely distracting."
4,"Good, but flawed","This book is significantly expanded from the first edition. It provides broad coverage of the nuts and bolts of DB2 and is excellent preparation for the IBM DB2 UDB V5 certification exams.Unfortunately, it is marred by a plethora of typographical errors: there is no improvement here from the first edition.A good proofreader would have made this an excellent book."
2,Uh...$75 shipped for a book on an obsolete version?,"Gotta rate this low, because the book is way out of date. DB2 is currently at 8.2. This talks about 6 and 7.1, for Pete's sake."
2,Keep Looking,"There has to be a way to make learning multiplication fun BUT this isn't it! The spinner doesn't spin, all the answers are on the board, it just doesn't cut it! All I can say is keep looking and let me know if you find something that really works!!!"
3,Just Okay,"We own several Learning Resources games an have enjoyed all of them except this one. When I pull the others off the shelf the response is ""Oh! Can we play?"" With this one it's ""Can we play something else?"" I think that says it all."
3,Lots of cameo's,"It was an ok movie, and it had madd cameo's it had Chris Tucker, Bill Cosby and a lot of famous black actors. That aspect maid the movie good."
3,Stupidly funny,"If you're looking for that strange, off beat, left field type of humour - this will knock your sox off. Make sure you have a few friends over, lots of chips and beer (or wine!)."
3,Funny Cult Classic,I thought it was funny when I first saw it back in the 90's and I baught it two weeks ago. RT reminds me of Eddie Murphy in his role as Meteor Man. You have to be open to this kind of humor to enjoy it. The special effects are good as well. Worth a look.
1,Very Sad!,"this Film&BlankMan are about Neck&Neck for Overall Wackness.I Have aLot of Respect For RObert Townsend but this Film does Him&THe Cast No Justice what so ever.Very,Very Few Laughs.He is Capable of Better than this.Hollywood SHuffle is one of the FUnniest Films that I Have seen over the Last 2o years.aside from the 5 heartbeats he hasn't come close to Hollywood SHuffle this film doesn't Reflect The Man's Talent at all."
4,Entertaining and very funny at times,"This movie never claimed to be the best comedy every produced, but it supports a large group of renown actors / actresses and some very funny moments. Any movie with D. Washington, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Flo from The Jeffersons, Ester from Sanford & Son, others... has to have it's moments."
2,Delightfully bad,"This is a fascinatingly bad movie, and one has to wonder if the director was intending it to be campy. Probably worth seeing at least once for the laugh value, and a definite must for people who enjoy bad movies (e.g. Troma films and the kind of films MST3k likes to do)"
4,"Great movie, great fun","... sure it's not the best movie ever, but great if you like this type of comedy...It's been years since I last saw this movie though, but I might buy it next month (Depends on if I get enough money to buy it)"
1,Worst movie I have seen in a long time.,"There are dozens of clever, offbeat films worth watching, but this isn't one of them. Makes Pootie Tang look like an Oscar winner."
3,I enjoyed it,"I enjoyed the movie when i saw the it years ago. But i wasn't expecting to knocked off my feet laughing hillariously. There's very few movies that does that anyway. I seen some of the reviews and i guess people see one movie of Robert Townsend's and they want every movie of his to be just alike, all gut ripping comedies.I consider this movie more of a fantasy thats very entertaining."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"Please do not buy this book like I did! Ignoring the previous customer's comment (sorry!) I went ahead and purchased it, buy was truly disgusted at how pathetic it truly is. As most of you probably do, I read at least 1 technical book a month, and have never read one written by as uninformed or inexperienced author as this. She has nothing even close to mastery of NT Server, nor proficiency in IIS. So keep looking!"
1,this book probably won't help you,I had the good luck to check it out of the library (i.e. did not spend any money) when I was researching the SMTP setup. On page 220 the author acknowledges the existence of SMTP service.
1,The title!,It is IIS3 for NT4. There is one chapter in the back regarding IIS4.0. Mostly it is an NT book writen from a lab perspective on a weak machine by authors who really don't know the subject as us professionals do. Waste of $ I took it back
1,"Stay away from this ""book"". I want my money back.","The nicest thing I can say about this book is that it would be nice if I got my money back. The book is filled with fluff and screen shots, IIS 3.0 drivel, and plenty of filler and errors. You want fluff? There's a very meager section in the book about BIOSes, and how an 850 meg drive was substituted for a 1.2 gig hard drive because ""NT would not install on the newer, higher capacity drive"". If this book was written when 1.2 gig drives were ""newer and higher capacity"", some serious revision is in order. This BIOS section is next to useless, and what is it doing in a book (allegedly) on IIS 4.0? I bought the book hoping that FrontPage extensions would be covered. They were, in a few screen shots, with one screen shot captioned ""You can very closely configure the Server Extensions with this tool."" (sic). And sick."
1,I have to aggree with the previous customer response,"I have to agree with the previous customer's review. I wasted alot of time and money on this book! I feel the book was hastily released before the product was even fully developed. After all, IIS 4.0 has only been in Beta 3 for a month or so now! Keeping in mind the previous fact, I want someone who has had alot of experience with previous versions such as IIS3 etc. The last thing I need in my buiseness is somebody teaching me new servers when they have had little to no expirience themselves. Instead, Im going to go ahead and learn the new server myself and hope that and hope an experienced user will come along and write a more consise book so future book buyers will have a more dependable and stable source."
1,not as comfy as they first seemed,"Sorry to say that I was very disappointed with these shoes. At first, they seemed very comfortable, but I am in the medical field and on my feet all day. The soles started killing me by the late afternoon despite the shoes fitting me very well. There just isn't much cushion at all. I've bought SAS shoes in the past and they are great right out of the box and onward. I just wanted something more stylish. But I guess I paid the price. If I can't return them now, I guess I'll have to try some insoles."
2,Not exactly the best for me,"I put these pads on my grand am and they have work hardened two sets of rotors??? I bought rotors at the same time as the pads they stop the car insanely quick and I have not one complaint there, my complaint is with the loud rubbing noise that has come from the weird like rubbing marks that rust and pit instantly using these pads. I will not buy these again unless someone can tell me why they are not leaving my rotors clean and smooth."
4,works as expected,"These batteries are great, but have to be replaced every year, as they tend to stop taking a full charge after that point if you leave your phone on 24/7/365. My girlfriend is great at forgetting to charge her phone for several days in a row, so the extended life battery is perfect for her, and of course the low price is worth it. Be careful not to buy unbranded batteries online - my experience is that ""OEM"" (original manufacturer) cell phone batteries are usually not OEM at all. With false claims, those Chinese knockoffs fail quickly. The best batteries are the branded ones from Korea or Japan."
1,"false advertising, this does not fit the VX3300",This does not fit into the VX3300 as advertised here. So you end up paying shipping charges both ways by this misleading claim.
3,Made in Japan???,"I would like to know if this battery was made in Japan, because the Korean version DOES NOT hold a charge."
5,good one,this unit is great. 2-3 days till i have to charge it. but i think i smell raidiation when it smokes. made my phone stick to my ear the first time.
3,"3.5 stars - a good album, but not essential","The 1991 self-titled debut album by Canadian rockers Big House is a solid, if unremarkable effort. The band's melodic hair metal sound is probably best described as L.A. Guns without the sleaze, or perhaps Warrant without the glossy elements. There is a measure of ""reformed punk band"" rawk swagger here, so the album doesn't quite follow the typical hair metal formula, but at the same time it wasn't unique enough to stand out from the rest of the pack.Big House is a good hard rock album, and worth adding to your collection if you're into this kind of music, but it's also easy to see why the band didn't survive grunge's 1992 eradication of the hair metal genre.PS - I think it's worth noting that all of the 5-star reviews for this album come from folks in Canada who followed Big House back in the day. I missed them the first time around, but I am a major hard rock/metal fan, and I just can't see this album being worth a 5-star rating."
2,Overly sexual,I didn't finish reading much of the book. There's no real story - only page after page of sex. That gets tiresome after awhile.
5,Fabulous Foam,"The product was described well. You receive 3 mattress-sized layers, each 4"" thick. The order of arranging the 2-non-visco layers should vary the firmness between firm and medium. You then cover the 3 layers with a mattress pad so it resembles a standard mattress. I arranged the layers for medium and I would say that it is more medium-firm. The visco memory layer is great and it makes a very comfortable sleep. The bed came in three boxes and arrived in a couple of days. The price was very reasonable and it fit perfectly in my waterbed frame."
3,Not what you Pay for,"I recieved this Product to find it smelled, and I was to recieve a cover , NO COVER, (THEY LIED) and will not recieve my complants!!!"
5,Magic Tree House #32,The best book I read out of all that I've read so far.I'm moving on to the next book now.
5,BEST ONE!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm 12, & this is the best of the Magic Tree House: Merlin Missions! It's when Jack, Annie, Teddy & Kathleen go to a freezing & bare land, where they meet the Ice Wizard (named in privious M.M.'s), who tells them to retreive his missing eye. Jack & Annie use a sleigh to ""sail"" across the winter wonderland, they also meet three Norns, who warn them about a Frost Giant! What happens??? Read the book!!!With the cute addition of tales from places like Scandinavia, which tell of mythical tales, this concudes this set of Merlin Missions. Next in the series, Jack & Annie's adventures will have MAGIC and (Yay!) HISTORY in the stories!!! Mary Pope Osborne...KEEP ON WRITING! Highly reccomened to anyone...Along with the rest of the series (YES: all 32 of them!!) & the wonderful Research Guides: The Facts Behind the Fiction!Happy Reading, Everyone!!!!!"
1,winter of the scary wizard,"My five year old daughter and I have read all of the Magic Tree house books and waited with great anticipation for this one. Unfortunately we couldn't get past the first chapter because of the notion of the Ice Wizard losing his eyeball and the children having to find it. What a scary concept for children! I'm sure the rest of the book was exciting and well written as are all of them in the series, but I wanted to warn anyone with a sensitive child that this one might be a little too scary."
5,The best book ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best book in the series. It talks about when Jack and Annie go to the land beyond the clouds in search for Merlin's magic staff. When Teddy and Kathleen show up they all go to the land beyond the clouds together. Want to learn more? Read the book!Kate, age 7"
3,Nice but not Great,This Book was Nice but it was not like the best book I ever Read. I usually like books and this was written well but it is just not my type. I know Mary Pope's Daughter Sarah and She gave this book as a Christmas Present. Sarah is my best friend and her mom is my reading tutor. She is very nice and writes well but this book is not my type at all.
2,It's Okay.,"I think this book is okay. If you are into rope art and are a beginner, I would recommend The Two Knotty Boys, Showing You The Ropes. This book breaks down the different knots and such, also, more detailed photos, in my opinion."
1,This Is A Horribly Book,the illustrations are poor. the book is on the westernized style of rope bondage. if you want to learn the more traditional shibari ties look elsewhere.
1,This Is A Horribly Written Book,I would not recommend this book to anyone.The instructions are confusing; the illustrations are unclear; terminology is different from one part of the book to another; PAGE NUMBERS ARE EVEN WRONG!!!This book is so poorly written it got me confused on bindings I already knew how to do.
3,Not for beginners; not for fun.,"This isn't the book you learn how to do Japanese rope bondage with. This is one for someone who's done it a lot and/or has a very patient bottom. This is for the people who like to look fancy.I wouldn't even really qualify it as Japanese bondage. The ties are too symmetrical. Japanese bondage is usually the opposite, with contortions in various directions. I don't even recall that being discussed here.The macramé part is definitely covered though."
5,Shibari You can use,"The art of erotic bonding is fully illustrated in this very nice book. The wording makes it easy to understand the purpose of and history for Shibari. Also, the instruction part of the book gives practical application for one to explore this fascinating area of sensation."
4,So True!!,"A friend and I were shopping and the illustrations in this book really caught my eye. When I read the title I made a joke and said I was buying it to deal with her, (just kidding of course), we had a good laugh. When I got the book home and read it, I was glad I bought it. The book is very small and cute but it has a fountain of good information. When I was done reading it I felt great.We seem to take things personally when someone isn't nice to us; this book helped me realize that when someone isn't nice to me, it isn't because of me. Now I don't take things so personally any more."
5,Informative,"Excellent advice on dealing with difficult people. Also great solutions to keep yourself balanced and have harmony with your spiritual and emotional self. Also, the illustrator, R.W. Alley is from RI. That is where I was born and raised. The illustrations are very creative. I have seen his work before."
5,Joyce Carol Oates - WOW!,"This anthology of never-ending subjects is a great addition to your short story collection. The variety and range of these stories is terrific, but Oates' storytelling is at its finest.The tale of a waitress who thinks she's ""ugly"" lingers long after the next story begins. A missing mother and all the rumors surrounding her disappearance never come close to the truth revealed at the end. Every single one of these stories are worth your time and the purchase of the book."
3,Faithless,I found many of the short stories in this book frustrating; whatever was coming next rarely eventuated. The characters were mainly interesting but only developed so far.
4,Faithless,I read it but it is not Joyce C. Oates best work. It is a good one to compare an contrast with in a formum sitting.

2,The modern-day Nagas,"So little is written about the Nagas - Tangkhuls, Maos, Kabius etc living in the Manipur State, or elsewhere in the north-eastern states of India. So this book doesn't represent 'all of the Nagas'. The modern-day Nagas are warm, friendly, very hospitable and peaceful folks. Music runs in their soul and they've got the voice to match! Yes, they are indeed, beautiful people."
4,When Rabbit Howls,"I recently had to purchase this book for college and I found it to be somewhat choppy, but overall, it was a very interesting book. As suggested by my Psychology professor, you might want to keep a small journal of the characters and events that take place b/c Truddi's personalities change so rapidly."
5,Triumph over tragedy,"I found this book an incredible read. Once I picked up the book, I could not put it down, except when the graphic details got to be too much. I congratulate The Troops for Truddi - - I think they are an awesome bunch who gave her strength and helped her survive, and they illustrate the power of the soul's desire to overcome. Even though I am not a multiple, it helped me understand and have greater compassion for those who are abused."
5,Awesome book!,I am amazed at the human brain and what it does to survive physical and mental trauma. This is a very sad story of abuse but an awesome story of survival.
5,Awesome book,I had read this book back when I was in High School. I recently had a class in Medical Terminology where I had to write a short paper on multiple personalities and that made me think of this book. Now that I have finished with all my homework I am looking forward to reading it again.
5,An Emotionally Challenging Look into the Mind of a Multiple,"The Troops for Truddi Chase did a remarkable job telling her story and explaining their significance in it. You will undoubtedly find yourself horrified at the cruel, sadistic abuse Truddi Chase experienced as a small child. Becoming emotionally involved in the book will give you a much greater oppurtunity to realize its true meaning and capture its message. The Troops are not trying to elicit pity, nor is this a money-making scheme on the part of the author and publishers. It is an unabashed look inside the mind of a woman, a child, and their 90 roommates. I was moved, not only as a psychiatry student, but as a daughter, a sister, a woman, and a human being."
4,A must read for someone considering a field in Psychology,I purchased this book after it was recommended by my professor in class. The book was fascinating to read and at times made me outraged at the life this individual lead and where she is today. A glimpse of multiple personality and how the personalities all worked together to protect the inner child of Trudy. I highly recommend such a book.
4,I thought the book provided a lot of insight.,I thought this book was very interesting. As a psychology student it helped me realize what a person dealing w/ multiple personalities is going through. They don't know it's happening even though it's taking over their lives. I would recommend this to anyone who has even the slightest background of mulitple personalties.
1,Skeptical delivery,"When Rabbit HowlsThis was recommended to me by a friend as a good read.Other reviewers stated it was difficult to get used to the 'language' and delivery of the way the Troops communicated. I didn't find this to be so, and I think anyone who read Watership Down as a kid will find some similarities also.Others mentioned that it terrified them. Was I terrified? No. Actually found some passages laughable.Don't waste your time. Vulgar and disgusting, totally manufactured."
5,Disturbing and powerful journey through incest recovery.,"This incredibly moving book brings tears to my eyes andrage into my heart every time I read it. Not for the faint-hearted, this is a journey through the therapy and discoveryof ""Truddi Chase's"" past.At the age of two, Truddi Chase's original psyche ""died"" asthe result of a brutal, incestuous incident. The abusecontinued for years. As the abuse continued, the Troopsgrew, and took shape, each one only marginally aware, if atall, of the others. The incredible internal dialogue whichensues and the rage which cannot and will not be deniedremind me on every page that this is more than anautobiography; it's a catharsis."
3,Interestingly disturbing,"This is not a book a would normally be drawn to. It was passed along to me as an interesting read. And that it is, for I imagine there is no other story like it.The book captures the nature of the multiple personalities of a woman who was subject to incest since an early age. Through her journals and therapy sessions Truddi and Dr. Phillips bring this amazing story to us. Oh, and whether I believe in this condition or not, let's just say I'm skeptical."
5,sad disturbing yet incredibly amazing,very compelling book I feel fortunate to read this however it is the most disturbing book I have ever read but it has been the most interesting book as well
3,"No Sybil, Still Interesing","A friend of mine passed Sybil my way and it kept me reading non-stop. This book is similar in the MPD aspect but the story is definately unique. I enjoyed how you read the book throught different eyes and opinions but was looking for a little more punch. Is it wrong to want more details, no matter how awful they are? The book spent a lot of time telling her story without actually 'telling' it. While it kept me coming back for more (I read it on my lunch break, while waiting in line, ect) I was dissapointed the book didnt give more exact past history. I realize since her past was horrific how awful that may sound, but its the truth."
4,A recommended read,"I borrowed this book from my doctor's office. It was a pretty interesting read, although I am not that familiar with MPD. I do relate to the out of body experiences that Ms. Chase assumes while one of her alts steps in to protect her. I am in awe of this book and can only imagine what it must be like to have so many different personalities inside of your head! I know I have a hard enough time keeping just one (me) straight! It was a bit ""triggering"" for me, as I did cry at some parts, but for the most part it was something I could relate to my own experience, minus the MPD."
4,Now I know why it was a bestseller!,"Rabbit Howls takes the reader through the time during therapy to uncover the horrors the troops of Truddi Chase live with. It is a gripping story, at times difficult to follow so reading the Introduction, Authors' Note and Epilogue is very enlightening. It is amazing the author was able to create the story from the journal kept, recounting the flashes of memory that gradually lead to the discovery of the 92 different personalities within Truddi Chase. The accounts of traumatic events are shocking. One can understand how healing this effort must be. I can see why this was a NY Times #1 bestseller. A good read to expand your range of books. This book presents some nice thought challenges as you try to figure out what the author is referring to in the writing. Certainly a nice change of pace if you're in a boring reading rut."
3,Great book - can be triggering/disturbing though,"Read this as a teenager after my mother read it. The book was amazing, I couldn't seem to put it down. It was incredible what this woman went through. However, if you are a survivor of abuse it can be triggering at times and disturbing for anyone. The abuse is discribed explicitly in some cases and with such details you can tend to hold onto it and internalize the childs pain. Be careful - otherwise it was a great read."
1,Written As Though It Were Untrue,"This book was written in a dull style, with a lack of detail about her day-to-day existence that caused me to consider it fiction. I don't mean to offend, but knowing MPD sufferers, I just didn't believe Ms Chase. Some of her claims, such as burning out all the lightbulbs in her house with her intense psychic scramble, are just preposterous and more indicative of schizophrenic delusion."
1,Howling for the truth,"I found it hard to believe that this woman was not completely overtaken by the desires of the therapist, which came through clearly in the influence shown throughout the tale, to have a MPD patient he could brag about and show off. Abuse, in my and the experience of all the abused women I know, is never forgotten; it is burned--every excruciating detail--into the mind. This book is completely unbelievable and defies reality."
3,Intense read.,"Received book in timely manner.Condition was as stated. Used, but not in bad shape.Have not read this book yet."
3,Good-Bad-Sad,"When I listened this album for the first time, I had a mixture of feelings. I expected this album with the couriosity, and got not so nice suprise.The lyrics are definitely good. Music is, like at Ten New Songs little too orcestraly for Cohen, but voice... Cohen used to call himself a man with the golden voice. Let's face the truth: Cohen was never marvelous singer that could sing opera arias, but on this album he hardly sang 4 different tones. He's voice losed all the gold definitely. Only singing on this album is performed by back vocals.Cohen can definitely still write wonderful lyrics, but his singing..."
1,What a let down,"I am a huge fan of Leonard Cohen but this album is a serious disappointment. It is hard to pinpoint exactly where this falls short... the sound and style are familiar but it lacks the intensity and passion of other albums. The previous album, Ten New Songs was soooooo good. This is flat, boring and almost formulaic. LC phoned this one in."
3,what happened?,Cohen needs a good kick up the ass...hes been making tired songs for years. It blows me away that someone older like aznavour writes more powerful songs...theres just no effort or passion in cohen anymore..theres no excuse!
3,Forgot the music,"As always the lyrics are astoundingly good, and his delivery supreme. That said, where is the music?His lyrics have always been great but they used to be accompanied by solid composition.(Ten New Songs and Future being prime examples)Half the songs soundlike he's reading his poems in an elevator. Honestly if you can get a hold of the lyrics from somewhere why buy the album?Maybe the album rubbed me the wrong way, but I would definetely recommend listening to the samples on this site before buying."
2,Stick to Composing,"The material on this CD, while not quite as good as some of Cohen's work,is still of very high quality. Cohen's voice, while never good, is absolutely frightful on this album. It is almost impossible to listen to the CD in one sitting-the strain on the ears is too great."
2,Flat,"I treasure Leonard Cohen and always look forward to his new albums with glad anticipation. This is despite the fact that seldom does he have an album that does not have at least one song that is irritating. But these songs are usually overshadowed by songs of brilliant aching beauty and wry wit.Not so here.This album sounds like discards that might have been dusted off to make an album after the artist has died. The production values that made 10 New Songs so enjoyable seem stale and flat here.Nowhere is there a good tale. These abbreviated haiku-like snippets seem like rough drafts rather than finished works. Leonard's voice, never his strong suit, sounds worse than ever.This is most peculiar, because on a couple tracks, he shows that he can still carry a tune.His powerful imagery and enlightening poetry is almost completely absent. The title track is inane.I like to introduce Cohen to new listeners. I will not be using this album."
3,The Slow Demise of the Ladies' Man,"It took me quite a few listens to warm up to this CD. Cohen's voice, which has never been strong, seems to have faded to raspy whisper. The backup singers take on a much larger role than any other CD and seem to be required to carry the melody on some songs, while others are spoken word poems. The CD is filled the typical Cohen somberness, but this time delivered with a lack energy. The addition of the live version of ""The Tennessee Waltz"" with its steel guitars seems out of place compared to the subdued tone of the rest of the album. Highlights of the CD include ""Go No More A-Roving,"" ""Because Of,"" ""The Letters,"" and ""Villanelle For Our Time."" All-in-all, a mildly disappointing effort from this cultural icon.Those new to Cohen are better off starting with one of his first four albums-- the ""Songs"" trilogy and ""New Skin for the Old Ceremony."""
3,"Not his finest, but still solid","A very inconsistent album, some great songs, some not up to his standard. Heres how they rank in my opinion.Great songs: The Letters, There For You, Nightingale, The Faith, Tennessee WaltzGood songs: Go No More A-Roving, Because of, Undertow, Villanelle For Our Time, To a TeacherPoor songs (or at least ones I can't really get into): Dear Heather, Morning Glory, On That DayFinal Thought: I wish he wouldn't let his background singers do so much singing, he becomes the background singer on a lot of these songs. We buy his albums because of him, not because of for Ungar, Robinson or Thomas however decent their voices may be."
2,Ah- the old days...,"From a tragic LC fan- just saw LC live in London and he was awesome- brought the wisdom and power of age to the old and even older lyrics! But this album lacks any sort of spark at all and is inconsistent in style. He CAN still sing as he showed in London- but doesn't even try in this album.But then to expect continued creativity at 70+ is maybe too much!Reading poetry in an album just pisses me off. And actually, that was the one moment when he didn't get rapturous applause at the gig- when he recited poetry for a few minutes.Still I'll get it out now and then probably...it's not awful, not kinda average. His worst I think."
2,Did I miss something?,"or has Leonard taken a path to plain uninteresting songs. I am a fan of his work (I'm your Man, The Future) even 10 new songs had some good tunes, but this one is better left on the shelf."
5,Dear Heather,"Dear Heather being Cohens 2004 recording is a splendid record. Cohen was 70 at the time and his vocal skills have certainly not suffered. He sings with the same strength and vigor as he did in days of yore. The lyrics are as good as ever. The book-let is a really strange one. There are numerous drawings that make no sense whatsoever but I guess I am not that smart that I can figure out what they mean. Sharon Robinson and Cohen have once again collaborated on some of the songs, The Letters, There for you and Go No More A-roving. Cohen is definitely not on a decline as many other reviewers have written. Cohen is as good as he ever was!"
5,THIS ALBUM IS TOTALLY WORTH IT,"I was delighted to see that L. Cohen had a new album out. People that dont like this album either don't like Leonard Cohen because they don't get it, or are very boring people who can only enjoy granola music of the slower tempo Dead Can Dance variety. Go No More A Roving, Because of, and Undertow are extremely fine songs that make this album a must. I don't see how anyone with a heart can not fully appreciate Undertow for the beauty that it is. Because of is also a very sexy song. The other songs are quite good as well.I would also definately recommend TEN NEW SONGS, for those of you who quit buying his albums after the FUTURE. It is every bit as important and sexy as the Future and Im Your Man. This guy knows how to pick his back up singers."
1,Unlistenable,"I have recently become interested in Cohen's music and purchased ""Essential Leonard Cohen"". It was impressive, so when I saw this new album (Dear Heather) I bought it without thinking too much about it. Big mistake. This album is basically unlistenable. I don't think I can get through the entire thing even though I keep trying with good intentions. If you are not a rabid fan I would skip this."
1,It breaks my heart,"to have to write this about Leonard Cohen, but this CD is terrible. You can vote this not helpful as many times as you like, but I wish he'd just put out a book of poetry and leave it at that."
1,"Forever your fan, but I'll sit this one out","For someone who idolizes every move that this incredible man makes, it is with great sadness that I place this one back on the shelf for good. Every album, before Dear Heather, holds the highest ranking. In my opinion, this album is every bit of disappointing. 10 albums out of 11's not a bad average."
4,Beautiful Macabre,This CD is so very beautiful. The music is absolutely fabulous. If you enjoy Edgar Allen Poe you'll most likely enjoy this cd. Anna Varney is beautiful but is rather tormented. I hope you enjoy this CD as much as i have.
2,Pointless Waste of Time,This movie is difficult to follow since it went from one scene to the next seemingly without completing the first scene. No explanation. It was as if I was viewing the chapters out of order. It made no sense. The acting was ok. It doesn't stand up to any Italian horror films. I went off of the recommendation on the box and the ratings I saw here. I was disappointed.
2,College project gone bad,"The cover art was clearly the most expensive thing in the film. Looks like a low budget college project. Scenes drawn out too long (problems with pacing). Irritating shaking of the camera, jumping about to create a disorienting effect in scenes where it had no purpose. (Seriously, Blair Witch has alot to answer for.)Protagonists make all the cliche'd mistakes to the point that you want to slap them. Supernatural entity done nicely and some good acting (along with the rather bad acting). Seen worse, but it came across as too ametureish to allow you to properly immerse yourself in the story."
1,Kept waiting for it to get good,"I nearly stopped watching this movie in the first few minutes because they were slow. I decided to give it more time but found myself pondering getting up and turning it off throughout the film and only didn't because I had nothing else to watch. Unlike another reviewer I won't be talking about this for days, I'll be trying to forget it as soon as possible. Yes it had good visuals and reasonable production values. It didn't help."
5,Nice and different,"I love the idea of combining light weights with bellydance. This is one of my favorite DVD's now because of the variety. I love bellydance but sometimes I do feel like I'd like to incorporate some light weight into my workout. However, I don't like all those boring workouts where all you do is just lift weights. This one has the best of two worlds. The girls are amazing and also I love the language options because I can brush up on my rusty French. What else could you ask for?"
2,Not as good as their old stuff,"I guess as time moves on and more 'fads' come along, you have to sink or float. The girls came up with some more 'updated' dvds and this is one of them. Not bad, for a belly-workout dvd. Pretty visuals, easy to follow, but compared to their older more traditional dancing that worked on EVERYTHING as you danced, this is more of a repetitive 'target zone' workout. I'd rather learn how to do those isolations, hip drops, chest lifts, and put it into dance THEN practice, than having the movements broken down into 'up and down' without the flow of movement that the old dvds had. (If you've seen the old ones, you know what I mean). I hate to see what the indi-hop one looks like. It seems the girls are trying to keep up and have their share of new stuff. Go back to the previous dvds to get the goods. At least you'll find the basics broken down so you can learn them, then put them into a routine at the end. May as well go to the gym and count out sit ups if you get this dvd."
5,Great Workout!,"This is definitely a great workout. It has everything from toning your arms, abs, hips, buns, and thighs. They incorporate belly dance as well, like snake arms, and shimmies. Since I've been bellydancing for a while I feel it's great practice for me. If you have never bellydanced it will be fun to shimmy the first time. Don't expect it to be a ALL bellydance routine, it has several exercises that are meant to workout different muscle groups. The whole DVD is about 70 minutes long, so if you don't have time to do the whole workout, skip to the abs or cardio. They have stretching in the end as well. I think its a great overall workout and I do recommend it to anyone who wants to get results overall."
