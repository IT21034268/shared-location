3,keeper of the heart (ly-san-ter),"I don't like cowardly, wimpy, women as the heroins of stories.Johanna's heroins normally give as good as they get but this one just seemed to cower in every corner."
2,What was she thinking?,"I love to read Johanna Lindsey's books but this one lacked something. Shanelle the heroine was scared to death of pain of any sort but in her home planet the men ruled and got to punish their women something along the way of leaving wanting sexual satisfaction and sheer toture for them well anyway Shanelle had to pick a ""Lifemate"" but in Falon's land they believed also in punishing there women but with spankings AHHH!! like they were some naughty children and don't know what is good or bad like if they themselves were so superior again Ahhh!! that was the only wrong thing with the book the thought of a man treating his wife like a bad kid is just plain silly. The book was kind like a Scotish Historical novel with Larid's and clan but with ""punishment"". Other than that the book was Okay."
4,i liked it!,"with a few exceptions it was a great read - one thing was that I was sort of frustrated with how whiney the heroine was about their first time and how bad it hurt and how long she carried on being scared. Otherwise, it was very cute and a great follow-up to Warrior's Woman."
3,ok... but not the best,I liked this book but his prequel was much much better. The story line was somwhat missing in action throghuot this book but it's always nice to know what goes on on Tedra's life and that of her children. Don't expact this one to be as hot as Tedra's and Challen's story- which was much better...
2,A Surprise,"From looking at the cover and reading the back synopsis, I never would have guessed this was a futuristic Romance, and because it isn't what I would have elected to read, I was rather surprise to find that I did enjoy it.I am really not into the 7"" tall, muscle bound men who are so Alpha, they make me cringe, but JL was able to make these two fairly evenly matched--it was okay for a light read, but it will definitely not be a story that will stay with me...."
5,Keeper of the Heart,"If you've read Warrior's Woman, you love Keeper of the Heart. I loved this book. Shanelle Ly-San-Ter and Falon Banyer make a great fictiona couple. I can't wait for follow-up book on Shanelle's brother."
5,All we're missing is Dallen's Story!,"This was a great book. The tension, the fire, the humor...i never wanted it to end. All Ms. Lindsey needs it to write Dallen's story. I would love to see him get his ""socks knocked of"" by a special lady! good work!"
1,Don't waste your time!,"Contrary to the opinions of previous reviewers, I give this book one star. If I could go lower, I would. This was one of the worst books I have ever read. I am appalled by this ""novel"".This piece of literature is the sequel to Warriors Woman. I do not understand how Ms. Lindsey can go from writing such a beautiful novel as Warriors Woman, to write one such as this. All the characters of her earlier novel are also in this one, but their roles have changed. They are not the same characters we loved.This story is about Challen and Tedra's daughter, Shanelle. She meets a visiting warrior, Falon Van'Yer. They are supposedly drawn to one another upon their first meeting. Love at first sight. We are then taken through almost 400 pages of extremely boring text, until they reach ""Happily Ever After"".The story line is very poor. The story itself does not make much sense. The main characters are very unlikable. I recommend that you do not waste your time or effort."
1,Never Received,I have yet to receive this book and it has been over a month. I am very displeased with this seller and will not purchase from them again.
1,"No, no, no, no....","'Keeper of The heart' is a sequel to 'Warriors Woman'. Let metell you, Warrior's Woman is EXCELLENT! I've read it more than 50times and I still love it. It's very funny, crazy and sexy. You'll roll around laughing, believe me. I LOVE the book. So that's why I look forward to reading 'Keeper of the Heart', to see what happened to the offsprings of the characters in 'Warrior's Woman'. Boy, was I VERY disappointed! 'Keeper of The heart' is a very poor imitation of the parent book. There is no strength in plot, in fact, there's no serious plot at all! To me, Shanelle is weak, empty and airheaded. I skip the first few pages because it's boring. Then I started skipping more pages. Then I ended up throwing the book under the bed without even bothering to read the end.So my advice? Read 'Warrior's woman' first. THEN read 'Keeper of The Heart' and you'll find yourself agreeing with me."
2,Didn't Enjoy One Bit,"Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this trite and boring storyline. Like Bertrice Small, Johanna Lindsey is very popular and like Bertrice Small, she is writing less favourably these days. She's losing her punch. I was bored."
3,No her best but no bad either.,"I own every book Johanna Lindsey has written, and truth this is the only one I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on. It isn't that it was a bad book but I don't approve of any abuse. Some people don't think that hitting a person in the butt is bad. No matter what it is hitting and it is meant to hurt and humiliate a person. I don't see it as romantic or erotic about this form of abuse. I hope nobody tries to justify the abuse that he did to her. Just thought I should warn people about the down part of this book."
3,Not what I expected,"I rely heavily on other readers' reviews before I purchase any book. I was disappointed. No where on the book cover was I alerted to the fact that this was going to be a story about robots, talking computers that can also transfer people from one location to another in seconds, androids, and traveling from one planet to another in airbuses. I kept looking at the cover wondering if the publishers mistakenly put that cover on a sequel to Star Wars with a mix of the cartoon The Jetsons. I could not get into this book but I was determined to finish it. But as Falon stated throughout the book, ""You are welcome to try."" The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because I cannot give Johanna Lindsey's work anything lower, most of her other books are outstanding. As I read most of the reviews listed here, I know my opinion will not be appreciated. So be it."
3,Something of a let-down.,"Well, I'm sorry, but in this book, I think the Big Guy loves Helpless Girl goes a bit too far. I liked the use of technology, Martha rocks!"
4,This was pretty good.,This is better than Warrior's Woman. It has a cool plot and the characters are very good.
1,Don't buy this if you liked the Three Tenor show from Los-Angeles.,"I am an adict of the Three Tenor cd from Los-Angeles. With Bush, Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the audience !It is an amazing show. I wanted more ! So I bought this cd. Bad ! Boring! Deception. By the way did you know there is a CD of Pavaroti at a Chrismast concert in Montreal ? This is an amazing show."
1,Wonderful,"I and any other Luciano Pavarotti fan will greatly enjoy this DVD. It shows much of his early life and early career as well as so much of his life, family & career. After having read all the books by & about Pavarotti, this DVD shows much of what the books said & is wonderful."
4,Please Buy From Target,"Don't buy used/new from these sellers. You can get it for $28 from Target. SO much cheaper.As to the review complaint about double sided disks--that's how it is for season 1 (no matter how you buy it).Anyway, it's a great deal from Target."
4,Has anyone found Errors on this Double Pack? Bones: Seasons One and Two,"I bought this double pack from ""Target"" and one disk has an episode of ""The Walton's"" on it and then the next episode wasn't recorded.Has anyone else had this problem?We love the package, just hope we can return and get a corrected version."
3,Works,"The set serves the purpose but I don't like the two sided dvd. Had a known they were packaged this way, I probably wouldn't have bought them. I've never seen a set up like this where episodes are on both sides of the dvds."
1,Never Received,I ordered this item Dec 22. I should have received it b Jan 13. It's jan 25 and it's still not here.
1,I've definitely used better chalk,"From reading the previous reviews, the issue is either that the bag is too thick to allow adequate chalk out or the chalk powder isn't fine enough. Which ever (or both) is the case, I just can't seem to get decent coverage without really squeezing, which can become difficult after a long period of climbing.I did get the refillable version, so when it runs empty I'm going to try filling some BD chalk or something else really fine ground and see if that helps."
2,Gotta grip pretty hard for Chalk,"The chalk bag comes filled - however I found that out of the packaging it's pretty worthless. I have to take it and basically throw it into my hand (like a baseball player trying to break in a glove) to get chalk on my hands. Gripping it I could get a light layer, but not really any significant amount.I did empty the bag, crushed up the chalk even more and did find it worked a little better. But the results aren't particularly pleasing. It takes either tight gripping of the bag or to get better results: some sort of impact against my hand (ie throwing it) to get chalk up. Throwing it is less than ideal since I don't particularly enjoy breathing chalk.It does work it just doesn't work particularly well. I don't think I could recommend this to anyone."
1,Perfoms poorly,"The material used for this sock is too thick and not porous enough. I can not get an adequate amount of chalk on my hands without really having to force it around in my hand, even then the amount of chalk is minimal. I actually think the majority of the chalk that does stick is from the residual chalk in my bag. I was using the Black Diamond refillable ball until it was taken from me. Needless to say I will be buying a new BD sock soon."
4,"great for climbing, chalk was a little clumpy",i bought this for my chalk bag as my indoor gym does not allow loose chalk. when i got it the chalk was a little chunky but i was able to crush it with my hands with out removing the chalk from the sock. it still has some chunks in it but the chalk has started flowing nicly from it. as i need a better flow i break up a few more chunks of the chalk and go.overall a nice chalk ball.
5,Awesome and refillable!,This is a great thing to have in the climbing gym so you and everyone else around you doesn't eat dust all night! Takes a little bit of time to crush up all the large pieces so you get the proper amount of chalk on your hands but after that it works great. It also helps so you don't over chalk your hands. It can be messy refilling it but I have refilled it several times and it feels just like new!
2,Terrifyingly anti-climactic,"I found this book confusing and disapointing. I like subtlety, but after reading many of these stories, I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to be scared of. I would go back and re-read the storys, thinking that I had missed something, but I never found anything, the stories were actually just not scary.For example, one story ends with a guy giving out his ex wife'saddress to a very non scary, but annoying, couple so that they can deliver some pictures. Oh but the ex told him not to! 0o0o0o0o scaaaaaaaary!I bought this book because I was impressed by one of the stories, ""Going Under"", which I read in a horror anthology. A fat guy trampling a crowd of people isn't too scary, but I found it extremely funny and dark.Anyway, if you like to be scared, and you're under the age of 50, this book might not be for you."
2,not grisly,"there were a few good ideas here. also some good writing. but the stories never seem to have a suspenceful enough climax. the stories were full of irrelevant stuff, like ""he went to work"", dwelling, and too long dialogues. the suspence died. some of the ideas were actually kind of interesting. inventive in a way. one story was actually good. but not enough is being invested in suspence, too much in people's actions and dialogues. if only there was more focus on descriptions and suspence. and some of the stories were also uninventive."
3,pretty pics but the author isn't qualified,"I knew this one was a no-go when the author announced within the first couple of pages that rattlesnakes are poisonous, which means not safe to eat. Rattlesnakes are not poisonous. People eat them all the time. They are venomous, which means they possess a venom which they can inject into a potential predator. Granted this is written for children, but if an author is providing info for kids, why not make it accurate info?"
5,works,There isn't much to say about this item except it came quickly and worked perfectly the first time and is still working. A good brand.
5,This is Too Easy,"Had the cable shipped along with new HP printer and spare print cartridge. In a world of $4 gasoline this was almost too simple. Just open the box, connect the cables and away we go. If only the rest of the world were this simple"
5,you need one of these,This was exactly what I needed. I didn't know if they even made this kind of replacement cord. I use it often for printing from my laptop. My whole system is older but works for me. Good thing to have!
1,"Did NOT receive a ""GOLD"" connector","Mine's not even COLORED ""gold"" but at least it works and was cheaper than the 25 bucks everywhere else. Still, false advertising is a serious moral problem and i would NEVER order anything from this company again! they know the product description is wrong, Amazon has been contacted, yet the ad remains the same. Pathetic!"
5,Works fine with HP LaserJet 1022 and MacBook,It is cheaper than getting the cord at the Big Box stores in the neighborhood.
5,These Work Fine,I'm using this to connect my printer to my PC. I'm very satisfied - and can't detect any problems. Many products which need a USB cable don't come with them. This USB Cable should do the job.
5,why pay more!,I can't believe I almost spent 3 times as much when I could get the same item through Amazon so much cheaper!! It does the job perfectly...
2,Sent the wrong cable,"Waited for this to get here for a project, opened it and it was the wrong cable."
5,USB cable,"Great USB cable - much cheaper that in the computer stores. Have used 6', 10' and 15' cable length, all with gold tips."
1,Misleading,I Purchased this product because it was advertised as having gold plated connectors. The bag it came in labeled it as being gold plated. It WAS NOT gold plated in the least.
1,Caution! May not receive the cable that is listed here!,Be careful if ordering the advertised Tripp Lite U022-010 USB2.0 Certified Gold A/B Device Cable - 10ft from ClearAV.That is certainly NOT what they sent to me. They are aware of the mistake in the listing but never contacted me before shipping my order to let me know that wasn't what I was getting.
1,bad bad cable,"This is a case of getting just what you pay for. I bought this cable to hook up a brand new printer. Not only did the cable not work, but it blew out my USB PCI card. This $4.55 cable wound up costing me a fortune."
4,Nice Story,"I really enjoyed reading this book because the story was great. I'm 16 years old, just like Nick so I can relate to him. The only problem was I thought it was kind of repetitive. She just kept repeating the story about her and Sonny and by the time I finished reading the book I had the story completely memorized. I just think there should've been more to it, the author should have been more creative with that part of the book. But, overall I liked it."
4,Very Intelligent and Extremely Watchable Film,"I think that this film was very well made and I can definitely appreciate all of the effort put into making ""Dan In Real Life""). What makes this film work is that the characters not only had chemistry (I'm also speaking of the actors here), but it wasn't difficult to relate to them. This movie exemplifies a scenario/story that could happen to anyone at anytime. It was nice to see this sensitive side of Steve Carell as well as the fantastic performances of the supporting cast. I would definitely recommend this for your home DVD/Blu-ray collection due to the fact that it can watched more than once."
3,Its OK,"Its an ok movie, I thought HEY steve & dane together should be hilarious! WRONG.Yes I smiled maybe once or twice throughout the movie & in all seriousness only laughed 1 time. Hope this helped! Stay blessed."
4,Dramatic comedy....,There are sooo many parts in this movie that are funny but then you have the drama parts too. I don't think this movie can be really labeled romantic since there was HARDLY any romance. It was a cute movie though.
2,Hardly a comedy,"Despite the numerous labels on the movie's cover from reviews, stating things such as ""Laugh-out-loud funny!"" and ""Hilarious!"", this is hardly a comedy. I chuckled maybe twice throughout the whole thing and spent about forty-five minutes of the movie trying not to fall asleep. Being a fan of Steve Carell, I was expecting this movie to be hilarious. If it weren't for the mislabeling, I certainly would have enjoyed it more, because I'd have realized it was a Drama and stopped watching it after fifteen minutes, thus saving myself about an hour and a half of boredom.If you're expecting a comedy, don't get this. The only thing that kept me watching it through to the end was the promise of ""Laugh-out-loud"" hilarity that I figured would come soon enough, and never did. Watching this is only disappointing--not to mention that the storyline is downright depressing if anything."
1,Worst movie of 2007!,"Dont let your wife force you to watch this piece of garbage. It may be the worst romantic comedy I have ever been forced to watch. I would much rather have watched an episode of sex in the city. Dane Cook, in addition to having a stupid first name has no business being on t.v. much less co-staring in a movie. He is extremely irritating as a comedian, and only mildly less so as an actor. Steve Carell should fire his agent.Jon Cremin ( dictated by his wife)"
1,What a real life mistake this was...,"Man this was really a low point in Steve Carell's career. I think he's a fantastic actor and I usually love his work, but boy did he make a mistake in taking on this piece of garbage. I'm guessing the movie was going for the whole artistic depth thing but frankly, I just don't understand it. The humor was forced and the plot was boring and ridiculous at the same time. Skip this one if you're not forced into watching it."
2,No chemistry . .,I think this movie would have been SO much better had they recast Juliette Binoche with somebody else (anybody else actually!) like Monica Potter for instance. I never bought Ms. Binoche on any level in this film and the entire family's total gushing over her was so unbelievable. Steve Carell's so-called chemistry with her was painful to watch. But the setting was beautiful!
2,Pan this real life,"There is nothing real, or likable, about Dan in real life. The movie meant to represent a real human being's foibles, sorrows and feelings. Instead, we are treated to affable Steve Carell using his The Office persona in a movie that has little depth, warmth or charm. Sadly, the film is an inexcusable waste of the remarkable talents of its actors, not the least of whom is Juliette Binoche. In fact, the movie is embarassing fake, with nothing in the dialogue approaching genuine conversation.Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Movie Dan In Real Life,The movie Dan in Real Life is my favorite movie. I was warned by my friends not to use U.K. thought I would take a chance. Well it didn't work. I had no choice since no new ones were available. Live and Learn
2,Hollywood Fake,"I was honestly surprised by how much I disliked this movie. Its 98 long minutes of fake. There's not a moment of honesty or sincerity in this entire cloying, Hollywood crapfest. Widower, Dan, takes his three daughters to a family get-together. Every one acts precisely the way some hack writer might imagine a real family would behave. One dimensional and oblivious. A running ""joke"" is that Dan is forced to sleep in the laundry room where every night just at bedtime his mother runs their rickety old clothes dryer which isn't anchored in place and makes a racket that would wake the dead. Hilarious. The story, such as it is, which arrives crammed against a subplot involving Dan being overprotective of his ungrateful daughters, is typical Hollywood coincidence 101 with a quick, neatly tacked on ending. Junk."
1,Didn't care for it,"Steve Carell, Juliette Binoche, and John Mahoney are talented, funny actors who you would think could read the phone book and make it entertaining. However, even their considerable skills can't breathe life into the turgid, melodramatic, derivative and predictable script that burdens this film. ""Dan in Real Life"" is a poster child for the proposition that you can't have a good movie without a good script - a proposition that much of Hollywood has never quite gotten through its head. You've seen all this before, particularly if you've ever seen a made-for-television Lifetime-style melodrama. If you are such a diehard Steve Carell fan that you must see this, save some money and rent it first.Despite this tedious film, I'm still looking forward to seeing ""Date Night."""
5,"I laughed, I cried, I bought it.","When this movie first came out the reviews were so-so and I didn't make the effort to get to the theater to see it. I just put it on my ""rent it"" list. I couldn't even tell you exactly why I love it so much, but when it later showed up on a movie channel I watched it over and over until I realized I should just buy it. This is a different side of Steve Carell. Still funny, but smart and vulnerable and struggling to do everything he can for his three daughters. Outstanding, if unexpected, casting. All the acting is first rate. Family relationships that feel genuine. I love this movie."
5,My 5 cents,"I'm a Carell fan, and this movie deserves more credit than the one given. My five cents here for this truly good movie."
3,Pros and cons for this movie,"I really wanted to like this movie but somehow it never got off the ground for me. The premise was good--an advice columnist does a pretty good job of messing up his own relationships with his daughters, brother, and possible significant other, but somehow the script faltered and the lines were often weird and pretentious. The setting was great--a lakeside cabin where a family gets together for a fun-filled reunion, but the family was over-the-top with comaraderie and games (does ANY family really act that way?) The lead actors were likeable, but somehow they never really clicked together. The chemistry was just not there. My husband liked the background music, but I found it somewhat annoying at times. This could have been a really good movie, but the flaws cause me to give it only 3 stars."
3,Dan in Real Life,"This movie is a lot more enjoyable if you find Steve Carel absolutely hilarious. If you're not so familiar with Carel, you might see this movie as watered down version of movie like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""You've Got Mail"" but not nearly as engaging. It has it's funny parts with Carel being his usual funny self shining through the character so if you just love him,it's still a watchable movie."
4,Steve Carell Finest Work!,"Dan In Real Life is a great film which deserved to do Much more at the Box Office.Steve Carell delivers his finest work in here. He's Outstanding. Juliette Binoche Too excels , Especially in the Bathroom scene. Dane Cook is Functional.Great Film!"
5,great,wow. i just really enjoyed this movie. the way the family in this movie treated each other was great. very funny.
2,Tripe.,"I love this guy on ""The Office"" and looked forward to watching this movie, but it just isn't funny (or otherwise good). Juliette Binoche is out of place and unconvincing, and there really isn't a single character in the whole movie who is sufficiently developed. Instead the film relies on one worn out cliché after another as it falls all over itself trying to be cute and endearing and taking every possible shortcut along the way. Despite a promising cast (including John Mahoney, who I always enjoy), it never rises above the level of an old episode of ""Eight is Enough"" in terms of the dialogue, humor, sophistication or originality."
2,"""Dan is Real Cliche...""","I have enjoyed Steve Carell in prior roles...but not here. The film is woefully miscast in its lead characters with Juliette Binoche looking and acting a full 20 years older than her supposed initial love interest, Dane Cook. The plot is so formulaeic that you know exactly what will happen and who will end up with who in the first 5 minutes and nothing that happens along the way comes as a surprise. The film works on almost no levels and is completely pedestrian in every way. Everything here has been done numerous times before and in better, funnier ways...don't rent, don't buy...move on and look for something else.."
2,"""NOT a Typical Steve Carell Funny Movie""......","I have tried quiet a few times to watch the whole movie but I get so bored I fall asleep or loose all interest & I don't know why but it just bores me.I also don't want my son to watch this movie,his father passed away not long ago and I don't want him to get all upset even more & I wish I had rented this movie instead of wasting money buying this movie.."
5,Seasonally pleasant.,"This plants me firmly in an autumn state of mind every time I watch it. It's a wonderful story with relatable, easy to watch characters. Worth every watch."
4,Dan in real life,"This is a fun movie, great acting by all the cast members. Highly recommend you see this movie. Steve Carrell is so funny and not in a crude way."
2,I love Steve but not this movie...,"The idea of a parent learning important lessons from their children is not something new. It's been done before, mostly in kids movies (Finding Nemo, Chicken Little, etc.) Many an emotional climax has come from a parent apologizing to a child. Right now I'm a teenager and I'll be the first to say that this bugs me...why can't the child ever be the one that needs to learn the lesson?This movie is like that, but with one hitch...the parent never actually does anything wrong. When he apologizes to his children in the end I'm left going ""Why are you apologizing? You didn't DO anything!"" Just another case of bratty kids sending their parent on a guilt trip. Sorry, but I hated it.However, Steve Carell is great as usual, which is why I gave it two stars."
3,Half a good movie,"There was a lot of promise in this movie. I enjoyed it up till about midway through. Dan is introduced well. He's raising three daughters alone since the death of his wife. We like him right away. He's funny and we feel for him so we are ready for him to fall in love. He meets up for a week-long family reunion and the big family scenes are fun. He meets a woman in a bookstore and they sit and talk for a long time before he gets her phone number. We know there will be some sort of complications to the match and are ready for something clever to get the two of them together. But alas, most of what follows is not terribly entertaining. The movie can't decide whether it wants to be light or serious and simultaneously fails at both, which one might not have thought possible. One moment Dan is suffering over the woman he can't be with, the next he's hiding in the shower. I really did like the movie somewhat, but just felt it could have been so much better."
3,Real Life?,"This was a sweet movie, but I felt that ""real life"" for Dan wasn't ""real"". I felt like the movie tried way too hard to let us know how fun and awesome the family is. (They have talent shows! They have sing-a-longs at the piano! They hold battle of the sexes crossword puzzle contests!) The football game had a Kennedy-esque quality to it, and the family aerobics scene felt especially contrived.I gave it 3 stars because overall I did like it (I love Steve Carell), but it could have been better."
4,Dan's a Winner,"I watched this movie with low expectations, and to my surprise, I absolutely loved it. It's very good, nearly great, and it raises the bar on what a ""Hollywood"" film can be. It's got an excellent cast of not-quite-A-list actors, doesn't break any new ground, and has a tidy and fairly obvious ending...but it still works really well and feels like an indie film. I love the family in the film, and I especially love that it portrays a family's oddities and dysfunctions without the cartoonish antics of films like Little Miss Sunshine. (Don't get me wrong, I love that movie, but the wacky family theme is a bit played out at this point.) ""Dan"" does everything right - it's funny without being jokey, sad but not overwrought. I liked it so much that I watched it again, two days later, this time with my family. Everyone enjoyed it, as expected."
5,Steve Carell officially a hero,"The more I watch Steve in movies, the funnier he becomes. I loved this movie for the following reasons:1 Its genuinely funny, original and light-hearted2 The acting is great and the characters are represented by perfectly chosen actors/actresses. They all play their respective parts amazingly well and the directors could not have picked better actors.3 The setting and atmosphere were superb. A wooden lodge out in the country for a warm and highly desired family reunion for the world's most chilled and loving family. You almost wish you belonged to the family.4 The music is great and I look forward to getting the soundtrack.All of the above in combination means a great film where you can sink away from reality, really enjoy it and laugh. Excellent plot to round it all up.Not classically a chic flick...If you're looking for a good movie on a quiet night in with pizza... enjoy this to the maximum, ita awesome. Its also one to own."
3,"Sugary, but no chemistry","Whatever it is that Dan falls for in Juliette Brioche is never made very clear here, so the film lacks heat in its love connection between the principles. Still, there are a few tearjerker moments that make this confection worthwhile viewing. You won't laugh, but you will cry - a little."
3,ABOVE AVERAGE STEVE CARELL GIVES A WINNING PERFORMANCE! 3 1/2 STARS,"'Dan In Real Life' is an above average romantic comedy. Steve Carell is perfectly cast as a lovable father of three growing daughters, who loses his wife and just can't seem to ""get back into the dating world"". By chance he meets someone special, but there's a problem, which I do not want to give away. It's much better to see it for yourself. I did enjoy this film as it deals with some interesting family issue, but I thought Dane Cook was a little out of his league, his performance isn't bad, but I just can't see him as anything, but a comedian. I watched this on a HD channel, so I do not know anything about the DVD features or quality."
4,Steve and Juliette create chemistry,"If you're a Steve Carrell fan or that matter, a Juliette Binoche fan, you'll love this warm family comedy, a rarity in these R-rated days. A significant departure from his coming out role in ""40 year old virgin"", Carrell, without the benefit of raunchy humor or toilet jokes, steps out into his own sphere as a light comedian and Binoche in a departure from her more serious roles, blends well with Steve in their scenes together. Even Dane Cook who I usually find irritating is decent in his role as his Carrell's brother who happens to be Juliette's fiance much to the surprise of Steve who has fallen in love with her. John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest are the parents, and Amy Ryan (an Oscar nominee for ""Gone Baby,Gone"") is also in the cast. If you love family comedies (""The Family Stone"" was the last one before this one) then do check this out!!"
3,Decent Movie .... Amazon Streaming Poor,The movie itself was OK. The humor is lighthearted but the movie tends to move a bit slow. My thoughts about the movie are tainted by the poor quality of the video stream coming from the Amazon servers. Several times throughout the movie there were pauses and even the movie reloading.
2,Ouch,"Now admittedly I did not see the entire movie. There's only so much torture I can take. Jeesh, so much acting talent wasted (no, I'm not including the ever-annoying Dane Cook here). I wonder how people like Carell and Binoche got sucked into this turkey. Is is possible it actually read well on paper? Hard to believe. Look, even if this was done well, the material is SO tired, SO predictable that it would have been unbearable. But, no, it was not done well. Ever character was remarkably tedious, each scene lamer than the last. Not a true or sincere moment in the entire enterprise. This is not a good film."
5,Speaking as a fellow murderer...,"...of love, that is. As a parent of teenagers, DiRL provided some welcome humor and a greatly entertaining perspective on our process. This movie both made me laugh hard (at the dancing and the shower scenes), tweaked my sympathy reflex (the song and the picture book on the stairs got me), and made me hopeful for parents and middle-adults everywhere. This was my introduction to Steve Carell, and he was completely adorable. (So much so that I have since found it hard to watch him in other movies and shows with perhaps coarser humor.) If you're looking for laughter, light-hearted entertainment, and a bit of pathos, then I think you'll enjoy this movie."
3,I like this move a whole lot!,This movie has a little of everything for everyone. Steve Carell is VERY funny! The story is really cute. It's a very entertaining film. Good supporting cast.Definitely won't be sorry if you went with this movie!
4,"Earth-shattering is 5 stars, merely excellent is 4.","This is an excellent movie. Those who love reunion films and great (realistic) acting will need to look into this movie. Based on a book of the screenplay, I bought this movie and I am extremely happy I did. Definitely recommended, with ample extras to extend your viewing experience."
4,Light and uplifting comedy,"Dan in Real Life is a light and uplifting comedy about family and relationships. Sometimes the comic scenes remind me of the National Lampoon's Vacation movies. Steve Carell and Dane Cook are great as the rivaling brothers. What I liked best about this movie is that it doesn't get too sappy, dysfunctional, or emotional like a lot of family-focused comedies get. It's a feel-great comedy and I recommend it."
5,You Gotta Love Dan!,"Dan in Real Life is one of the rare movies that will be a keeper for me. In fact, I have seen it 5 times and I'm sure more will follow. The scenery, cast of characters was fabulous. I found the moving both funny and touching, and have told everyone not to miss this one."
1,Blu ray movie,The movies wouldn't play in any of my four blu ray receivers so I was unable to watch the movie. Very disappointing.
2,Michael Scott in Rhode Island,"Steve Carrell (Dan Burns) played too much of Michael Scott in this one. It was like THE OFFICE in a family setting. Dane Cook didn't really add much to the casting. And Juliette Binoche (Marie), unlike Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Colin Farrell has yet to master an American accent to be believable, much less intelligible, with her natural accent fading in and out.Pretty sappy premise and very predictable circumstances. Especially with Dan's daughter's dispositions. And the music of Sondre Lerche playing in and out of scenes was really annoying. Their music was fitting at the end but was overdone during the movie."
3,Dan In Real Life Review,"I was really excited when I ordered this product because it was a Christmas gift for my best friend. When it arrived I was slightly less than thrilled. The product information had said it was in very good condition, but when it got here that didn't quite seem to be a proper description. The cardboard covering was ripped and warn so I had to just throw it away before I gave the gift away. I was a little bit worried when I gave it to my friend because really who wants to give a less than perfect gift away? In the end I am pretty sure that the DVD works just fine, which is all that really matters I guess, but I was rather disappointed. I can't blame the person who I bought the product from fully for sure for my disappointment because it very well could have been something that happened in the shipping process, but either way I wish that I would have known that it was not going to be in what I would consider very good condition."
3,Steve Carell's best work yet !,"This has to be Steve Carell's best work yet. I LOVE the office. But I am tired of seeing him just do stupid comedy. He really does a great job here. The usually amazing Juliette Binoche is actually looking a little rough and looked quite a bit older than both Carell and Dane Cooke. She needs to slap on some sunscreen once in awhile.There are a few too many brothers and sisters roaming around in the movie. Otherwise, it's pretty good."
5,Refreshing and humorous movie,"I'm probably giving it an extra star but it is a breath of fresh air.Exceptionally well-paced look at parenting and love, in a humourous extended family vacation set at the grandparents house. Dan struggles to communicate values and patience to his adolescent girls while falling head over heels in love to an unavailable woman. Several scenes and plot twists are manipulated for the sake of the story, but overall it's a refreshing and smart movie for all ages. Diane Wiest is outstanding as always as well."
2,Barely Tolerable,"Sorry Steve Carrell, I love you, I rented this movie because of you, but I could barely watch this over-the-top lovey dovey family movie about a man in love with his brother's girlfriend. The relationships were unbelievable, the romantic interludes were cringe-worthy, and I'd like to have the two hours of my life back spent watching this movie.I also agree with the comments a few reviews down about the large family. I think that was the worst part of the movie, Dan's extended family is overwhelming, and corny. Half the characters should have been cut out of the movie.I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but this was not a good effort in the Romantic Comedy genre. Two stars because I can think of a few people who might like this, definitely not for me and I do not recommend this movie."
3,40 YEAR OLD WIDOW?,This movie seemed to try to take on another swing to the 40 year old virgin. It was simply ok but not that great.
4,"Fun, quirky, heart-warming comedy","I am lukewarm on Steve Carell overall, but really enjoyed his performance as a widower struggling to raise three girls. The rest of the well-casted ensemble did a nice job as well in what we found to be a funny, quirky, and heart-warming love story."
4,Davis Comprehensive Handbook is BIG on info!,"Davis's Comprehensive Handbook of Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests: With Nursing Implications, 2nd Edition is BIG on information! The depth of diagnostic information is awesome and refreshing, no more guessing at what to tell a family about why a test is being done.I highly recommend this book to anyone working in the medical field or for patients requiring extensive medical tests.Nurse's can learn the implications for each ordered test. This books highlights the implications of WHY the test is needed or WHAT the test will diagnose or rule out.This book should be considered a reference book as it is bulky to carry around, yet a book that is definitely going to refresh any nurse's memory on even simpler ideas involved with diagnostic tests.My only concern is the cover and pages are printed on thin paper and I hope this book will withstand the normal wear and tear of referencing the book when needed."
5,Very helpful!,This book is not even a requirement in my husband's nursing studies but helped a lot throughout his nursing school. I even use it as a reference in my work! It has been very very helpful. I'm very happy that I have purchased this book.
3,Laboratory and Diagnostic,I recieved the book in very good condition and it was shipped in a very timely matter
5,CLosing the GAP,"I thought we were doing quite well with our communication level with our pre-teen boys, but I am learning about a whole new set of caveats and superb strategies to lay the baseline before it all goes to hell in a handbasket.Parents, this is the manual you have been whining about not having :-)"
2,not something parents should read,"This is not a good book for parents to read. It tells parents that it's okay to invade their kid's privacy, and it makes all teenagers sound like horrible irresponsible monsters. It has some useful info for kids, but parents should not read this book as they will get bad Ideas from it. At the very least, kids should read this book themselves before letting their parents read it. I would rate this book RP (Restricted for Parents) ^_^"
1,"No, not this one!","I once owned this cd. ""The Stripper"" is not the original version. Joe Loss has the best version to date."
1,Another brief lousy Guess Who collection not interested here,I think this disc was re-issued already by RCA records in 1999 with a Greatest Hits compilation CD disc. I know they've gone too far with this one because I already have these songs on my Ultimate Collection box set with three compact discs and it sounds pretty good so who cares about this one. It does'nt taste my music interest here!
2,The Greatest What?,"If you must have a greatest hits album get ""The Best of The Guess Who."" At least that is a brilliant collection. The Wheatfield Soul/Artificial Paradise album has far more brilliant moments."
2,BETTER SOUND ELSEWHERE,"Great songs by these witty, bluesy folks from Saskatoon, lots of their best and most popular songs, but this early CD quality of 1987 does not sound very good. Obtain the original recordings or later versions of this clever, happy, very musical group."
5,Great product!,"I bought this headset as a busy office manager/legal secretary/receptionist to a law firm. Before this headset I was glued to my desk, and got incredible headsets from holding the phone with my neck/shoulder while my boss dictated pleadings and letters to me over the phone. Additionally clients would ask me questions and I would have to put them on hold while I pulled their file - no more! I can even walk across the hall and be in another person's office and still get crystal clear reception. The lifter is also a must have because with the exception of pressing a button on your headset to answer the phone you hardly ever touch your actual phone - truly exceptional product!"
3,"Works okay, for a while","We bought 15 of these for our CSRs in 2007. Since then at least 10 of them have been sent back to Plantronics. They tend to work fine for a few months, but eventually they'll take 10-15 seconds to raise the handset. By that time the call has gone to voice mail and we've got an upset customer to deal with.We may have gotten a bad batch. The date code on these was F7 and they were made in Mexico. The replacements we got from Plantronics had a different date code and were made in China. We've yet to have a problem with the replacements. Unfortunately these units only have a one year warranty. I just had another one malfunction a few days ago and the warranty ran out in August."
1,"Significant Backround Noise, Poor Range, Slow Mute Process",I'm on the phone several hours a day while sitting in front of my computer. I've had previous Plantronics headsets that I was happy with. I can't walk very far from my desk (30 feet or so) before it starts beeping in my ear. Muting is an awkward and slow 3-second process that involves holding down the volume control key. Why not just had a simple one-function mute key?The most significant problem is that it picks up a lot of background noise and callers tell me they can hear my keyboard as if its right in front of them.I've been pretty disappointed with this one.
3,Have had to perform reset a few times,"Works fine, but I've had to perform the reset a few times after it quit lifting the phone receiver. This has been happening at least once per month."
3,Plantronics CS70 Review,The CS70 is a comfortable and effective device. My only issue is the range. I'm quite disappointed with the limiting distance allowable from my base unit/phone. I have a home office and can't go beyond 40 feet. I had heard that there was a range anywhere from 100-300 feet.
2,Sounds good but don't wander too far away,"I was really disapointed with this product. I did like the sound and the size and the way it fit behind the ear. What I didn't like is the range. Plantronics claims 300' but when you talk to their tech support, it's 300' in an open field. They told me that through walls and the like the range is more like 150'. That would satisfy me, but I could only get about 30' away and I would get the out of range beeps. Tech support said that the headset was defctive and to exchange it. I must give credit to Amazon, they have excellent service. I received the replacement in just a couple of days. Sorry to say, I had the same problem. I had to return it also. I am comparing this headset with my old GN Netcom GN9120. With the Netcom headset I was able to get a 160' range."
4,Very Good Product,"We have purchased (4) headsets for our medical office and are very happy with them. They have good range which allows us to move around the office without losing connection. Very easy to install. Comfortable earpiece with several different ear buds to choose from. Ear buds are easily swapped if you need to trade desks with another office worker but still want to use a headset. Only drawback for me is the volume. There is a volume control on the earpiece, but I wish is went just a bit louder."
2,"Uncomfortable, poor sound quality","I've used a number of headsets through the years, and this one is a big let down. It's not very comfortable (most headset aren't). An even bigger problem is the ease of use and sound quality. DECT 6.0 is supposed to provide excellent sound quality, unfortunately that is not the case with this headset. When I talk I can hear myself echo. I've adjusted all the settings and the echo will not go away. The echo is also ""distorted"" which makes it really hard to concentrate while talking.Another problem is the ear piece does not seat well with the base station. You have to fumble with it to make a good connection.Pros:Nice looking design.Earpiece is light.Cons:Uncomfortable.Poor sound quality.Echo! Echo!Earpiece and base to not match up well making it hard to charge.Too many setting switches to maintain."
4,Good Clarity,"Product is comfortable and worked well right out of the box. Excellent clarity. Only downside is there is no ability to bind with other bluetooth devices (such as you cellphone). I had a cheaper headset that was not as clear as this one, but which had the ability to bind with other devices. Handset lifter is something you don't think you need until you have it."
5,All hail the kings of Aggro Metal!,"Testify emerges again, this time armed with 5 new tracks and 4 remixed by the likes of Die Krupps, Die Warzau, and Plastic Noise Experience. Relentlessly harsh and ever aggressive, the team of Myk Jung, Moses W. (both of The Fair Sex), Mathias Black, and Ulf H. return to remind us that they are the reigning masters of the dark, guitar-driven industrial niche. For those of you who wish Ministry hadn't gone soft after Psalm 69, Testify will more than make up for what you've been craving. From devastating guitar manipulation to controlled insanity, Testify's ""Crack The Mind"" is an awesome addition to Van Richter's catalogue."
4,Tap Dancing Sensation,"Adapted from a 1930's motion picture, ""42nd Street"" (starring Jerry Orbach and Tammy Grimes) is a choreographer's dream musical.Besides the great dancing, however, the musical comedy contains several classic tunes, including:You're Getting To Be A Habit With MeWe're In The MoneyLullaby Of BroadwayShuffle Of To Buffalo42nd StreetWhile the music is a bit dated for my taste, these are classic songs & are great seen within the context of the show."
3,OK,"You can not got more than the music that was in the original play, that is what I got and that was what I wanted"
2,Too boring for me.,"Maybe I have just been spoiled by the modern musicals, but this classic was boring. half the songs were dancing, and that isnt exactly what I like listening to. A little tap is ok, but not this much. I also like to have a couple ballads in the show, but this one was balladless. Jerry Orbach sounds great, when you get to hear him, but even that isnt very often. Why not get The Fantastics instead? This show just wasnt for me. I would suggest that collectors, and classic lovers, get this one. Other than that, pass it over. Favorite song: ""Lullabies of Broadway"" (only because Jerry Orbach sings most of it.)"
2,Works great. Breaks even better.,"I bought these two weeks ago. I liked them because they're compact. The sound quality is very nice for something so small. The noise cancelling works great too.So why two stars?For starters, the noise cancelling unit is very sensitive to interference. If I put the stick next to my cellphone in my pocket, it creates a very loud, constant popping noise.Worse though is my headphone is broken already. I only use this around the house, but the plug is very weakly designed. Most headphone jacks are curved or made out of hard plastic.This one is long, narrow, and wrapped in rubber. So it took about two weeks of casual use for the headphone jack to completely come off.I'm sad."
3,Not good enough for lawn mowers.,"The sound is very good, but the noise cancelling is not great. Probably better off with the around the ear version. this would eliminate some external noise. At any rate, it is not good enough for a lawn tractor. ;>)Is anything? However, if you play the music loud, it is better than nothing. Probably fine for air travel or lesser decibel noise."
3,sennheiser pxc 250,"While these headphones did deminish the most irritating noise, I felt that they should have been more effeicent in their performance. They work best if you sit forward of the engines, the noise is still very irritating when behind the engines. A headphone that covers the ear better may work better. At appx $100.00 they are not a bad deal but are only a little better than ear plugs. Having said all that I was glad to have had them on 13 hour + flights."
4,great deal for the price,"Bought a pair of these as refurbushed. tried them out on a transatlantic flight.. was amazing how much noise they cut out (and amazing how much noise you travel with without these). they do let a little noise in, as they sit on the ear, i could close it all out by pressing them against my ears... tried my friend's Bose, and they cut out all noise, probably because they fit completely over/around the ear. So for absolute quiet, get the bose. But for great performance for a lower price, these are a great deal."
4,Excellent noise cancelling at a great value,"The Bose quiet comfort headphones set the standard for noise cancelling headphones, but they are bulky and better suited to home listening than travel. The Sennheiser PXC250 headphones fold into a small package, deliver very good sound and come in a nice little case that has room for an Ipod and a few accessories. The case fits easily into a briefcase or purse and allows one to listen to music or podcasts without disturbing others (or, because of very effective noise cancelling, being disturbed by them.) All in all a very nice product that does what it says it will."
4,Great for Airplane Use,"In summary these headphones are amazing for airplane use and I definitely recommend them. They are a great gift for frequent flyers. I was sceptical about the PXC 250's ability to suppress outside noise, especially during flying. When I put them on -- Wow! They greatly reduced that airplane droning sound. They also sound quite good. Curiously I found that considerable noise was reduced without the noise suppression on, perhaps 80% of the total effect. I'm curious what others think.I have never found any pair of headphones that I could comfortably wear for hours which I believe is true with many others. Same is true with these. I also agree with a few others that the noise cancellation creates a feeling of ear drum pressure which I found somewhat uncomfortable. Size is good for travel. All in all I am happy, no GRATEFUL, to have these headphones.Update 15-March-2005: Can't imagine traveling without them."
2,Not what was expected,"I purchased this unit based on owning a prior Sennheiser headset. This unit is nothing like the old one. It is quite a bit flimsier, less comfortable, not loud enough, and the noise cancelling unit is large and unwieldy. In addition, the power button is easy to turn on by accident and thereby drain the battery. I will be returning it when I return from my trip."
4,Sennheiser PXC 250,"This headphone is ideal for travelling plane/busall backgroundsounds are Compensated by 80%. Voices and other irregular noises aren't cancelled, but that's not what it's made for.Music in combination with noise cancelling function works perfect.One remark that I must make: it's fragile, so take good care of your headset. store it properly, ...It requires 2 AAA batteries who last a long time.it's not the most expensive one, so not the best one, but for this price, it's good quality!"
3,Great sound not so great comfort,"I tried these out for a few days and ended up returning them. The good news is that they sound amazing. The clarity was superb, the bass was punchy. The noise cancellation was ok, but because they don't cover your entire ear its not as good as full size headphones. My main complaint with these was the comfort. The pads put a lot of pressure on my ears and they didn't sit well on my head and would slip off too easy. I decided to return them and bought a pair of used Bose QC2 headphones from a local seller on craigslist. Comparing the two I would say the Sennheiser's had a little clearer and crisper sound, but the Bose do a much better job of noise cancellation and comfort. The sound cancellation and isolation is so good on the Bose you get scared when someone walks up behind you because you cannot hear anything in the room. The sound on the Bose is very good as well."
4,Good headphone - just a little pricey !,"I have tried several headphones, being a frequent traveller. I like the packaging (carry-on bag) for the headphone supplied with the unit. Makes it convenient to carry not just the headphone but my iPod as well in the same case. Sound quality is very good. About the only thing that could be improved is if the headphone size was a little bit larger to cover the ears completely. It's seems a bit pricey, in my opinion."
4,my head is too big,"i think my head is sort of large. Headbands have always given me a headache and this headphone is no exception. I can wear it for an hour then I have to take a 10 minute break.Haven't used the noise canceling yet but just putting on the headphones blocks out a lot of noise for me.Also I have a new MacBook and the headphones don't seem to plug into so that it's flush. Seems to stick out a little. This means if i jiggle it around too much it falls out easily and the music starts playing outloud instead of in the headphones.other htan that it's pretty portable, nice to use, music quality is pretty good. No complaints. I guess i just have a big head."
2,"Not the quality I expected, not working right after 3 weeks?","They worked fine and had pretty decent sound quality when I got them. However, for some reason now the left earphone has barely any sound coming through it and it seems like something regarding the sound on this side is broken ALREADY after only 3 weeks of use. Not sure if this has anything to do with it but the cord is already twisted hellishly bad, I was so very careful with these and did not move around when using them but they twisted into a pile of garbage within the first 2 weeks of use, which is not acceptable - signs of poor quality wires used, I had this problem with some other cheap headphones I purchased but not my $25 Sony headphones which I may go back to after this. For the amount of money paid I expected these to last longer!"
4,Noise reduction,Great sound! Makes my train commute much more pleasant.The electronics requires a sizeable unit between the sound source and the headphones. Kind of clumsy. Wiring could be a foot longer.I have heard the Bose at three times the price and don't believe there is a significant difference. An audiophile would be listening in a room that would not require noise reduction anyway.
1,Horrible Headphones,"I bought these with the intent to use them with my mp3 player. Every time I walked around with them and bumped the connected battery pack, you would hear a light thud sound in the headphones. Almost like they weren't designed to walk around in. [...]."
2,Not Circumaural,"The noise canceling capability of these is pretty good. I've tried the Bose Queit Comfort 2s and this functions similarly. However, the ear cups on these are NOT circumaural, therefore they don't block sound the same way. The cups are smaller than your ear. It's too bad, because if the cups were a little bigger, they'd be great."
3,Sennheiser PXC 250 Headphones,HAVE TO SAY FIRST: NEVER HAD A PAIR OF SMALL HEADPHONES PRIOR AND HAVE NOT SAMPLED OTHER BRANDS OF NOISE-REDUCTION PHONES. THESE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE ON ME AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR. THE BATTERY PACK IS KIND OF A PAIN TO PUT SOMEPLACE AND HAVE IT STAY PUT AND OUT OF THE WAY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PHONES WITH/WITHOUT THE REDUCTION FEATURE ACTIVATED SEEMS MARGINAL TO ME.
3,They're okay.,These were the first expensive headphones I purchased. They make a slight humming sound when the noise cancelling is turned on. I use them at my desk at work. I want to try something more expensive next time. Maybe BOSE.
2,low expectation matching,"It works only on the airplane, where it falls impressively the engine noise. But I bought it for isolate myself in the open area where I work, no many changes and soar my delusion."
2,Dissapointed,"After reading some of the reviews I thought these headphones would be a good choice. To me they seem only a step above standard headphones, therefore I have a little trouble understanding the justification for the cost."
1,Set your expectations low with the PXC 250,"Yikes. I had high expectations for a (...) pair of headphones, and the Sennheiser PXC250's really let me down. First of all, the audio quality of these stink. Very tinny highs and non-existent lows. Not to mention, the noise cancellation technology really is nothing more than a hiss generator and volume booster that drown out the ambient sounds. The headphone cord is too short, and the power/control unit for the noise reduction is heavy, big, and always gets in the way.If you want noise cancellation, spring for the Bose. Otherwise buy a better sounding headphone (my cruddy Labtec that I was replacing sounds better) and cranky the volume yourself!"
1,Sennheiser PXC-250 Very Disappointing,"I had very high hopes for these headphones for my 20 hour trip to Brazil, but after they failed to lower the whine of the vacuum in the house, or the chatter of TV, I became suspicious of their performance. I then tested them head to head for sound performance against my standard Walkman headphones, and they sounded tinny and cheap verus the rich sound of the OEM Sony Walkman headphones. I now have them wrapped up for a product return. They aren't worth carrying on the trip to Brazil."
1,50 cent ear plugs would work much better...,I bought this item for my husband to use while studying. They didn't block out any sound. They did make the sound a wee bit quieter... but nothing is blocked out. We are returning them as they are NO WHERE worth the $130 and buying ear plugs from the grocery store!
3,"Good for their class, but with some defects","The price is definately right for noise cancellation headphones. The noise cancellation capability is good, but is not on par with some of the noise cancellation headphones by Bose, which incidentally are much more expensive.The headphones do require two AAA batteries for noise cancellation to work. They will work without the batteries, but some of the bass goes away.The reason I give it three stars is that the left speaker has died after only 2 months of use, but as always, your mileage may vary."
1,The first and last Noise-Canceling HP for me,"I bought these headphones after reading a few online reviews for this product, but without trying them first.The sound quality was not impressive (considering the price), they sound very weak when the noise canceling was off, and when it is on you could hear a very load hiss.This means that in a quiet environment you must suffer the hiss if you want to hear the bass load and clear.I had a personal problem with them which was a painful pressure on the drum-skin similar to scuba-diving( before equalizing ) after using them for a few hours.I ask friends to try them and they experience only a mild pressure so it must be me( and I guess you will experience the some pressure with every noise-canceling headphones )I also didn't like the noise canceling device in the middle of the headphone cable - very heavy and cumbersome, but again this is probably the case with every noise canceling HP.I'm sending them back"
2,Awesome product!,"This product is really awesome with respect to design, appearance & performance. Maybe Sennheiser can improve the ear pads in the future as my ears starts to feel uncomfortable after about 2 hours of use."
3,Cancels some but adds some as well.,"This product adds some high frequency noise in the background but is effective at reducing a lot of low frequency noise. They are very good for airplanes to knock out the low hum but are ineffective for higher frequency ambient disturbances. Battery life has been great so far. I've used them for 15-20 hrs and still going strong.The circuitry box needs to be separated from cell phones to not be extremely noisy due to cell data transfers.The loose fit against the ear makes them a bit ineffective as well. You get a -seashell- shushing sound boost because of their loose fit against my ears like a closely cupped hand. However this is cancelled when switched on. Overall they cancel more noise than they add. However, the loose fit is very comfortable for long hours but I find that pushing them tighter against my ears makes the noise cancelling twice as effective."
2,Good noise cancelling but - electric shocks!!,"OK these provided excellent noise cancelling and the batteries haven't died yet after more than 41 hours of travel.The headphones get quite uncomfortable after about four hours of use - they start to squeeze the edges of the ears and get quite hot too. I'd rather get a larger pair for flying, in retrospect.But the worst issue I've had, which I've never anticipated, is electric shocks in one ear every few hours! They come without warning and are completely sporadic. I've sent the headphones back to Sennheiser so I hope this gets sorted - they claim not to have heard of the issue before. But if the problem isn't fixed, it will completely put me off the brand. Not a problem you expect or want - it's a horrible sensation!"
2,These headphones do not age well,"I've had these headphones for about 18 months. I purchased them for my frequent plane travel and have been happy with their performance. I hadn't used them for awhile, so they've been in their carrying case in my climate controlled home. A couple of weeks ago, I got them out to find that the plastic or whatever coating on the earphones had disintegrated - this is the layer that covers the foam of the part of the headphones that sits over your ears. If you put them on, you would get a coating of little black pieces of the coating all over your ears and neck. Very disgusting."
2,Short in the connection,"Sometimes they work, most times I'm listening to the short in the cord. I don't know if all of the headphones are made this crappily or that I just got a bum product. They worked for a couple months, but now, every time I move, the sound cuts in and out."
5,BOSE quality without the BOSE price,I was looking for something with a BOSE quality without the BOSE price. This is it. Noise cancellation was comprable. Haven't had it long enough to know about battery life but love the fact the control is straight line in the cord and not built into the ear piece (easier to remember to turn it off).I would buy this again for a gift with no worries about the quality.
4,works as advertised,"My partner and I took a couple pairs on our trip to China and were quite pleased. They significantly reduce constant air cabin noise. Isolated noises such as children screaming and overhead announcements were slightly reduced as well, but not near as well as the constant air cabin noise. The headphones were comfortable, lasted forever (we wore them for over 10 hours and they're still going), and they fold up in the carry case nicely. The dangling battery pack does get in the way, but it's a small price to pay for a relatively inexpensive quality set of noise-cancelling headphones."
3,"Good for music, some noise cancelling","These headphones allowed me to listen to music and an audio book on a recent flight (and in an airporter bus) but did not cancel the loud bass engine roar as completely as I'd hoped. They were a definite improvement over nothing at all -- canceled the lowest of the undertones -- and were comfortable to wear and very portable. As an unexpected benefit, I liked that my iPod fit nicely into the headphones case. If I travelled more frequently, I'd probably save up for Bose noise canceling headphones."
3,Sennheiser PXC 250,"OK quality and comfortable, however, the battery case is too large and weighs too much for this type of headset. Concerned that headphone attachment to headband will easily break due to swivel contact point.Noise canceling ok but still hear a lot of background aircraft noise. Wires also cumbersome, maybe, they should build headphones with retractable wires. Case is also ok but larger than needed IF battery case was not so big. Finally, would like to see a volume control on the set like the PLANE QUITE headphones."
3,"good, but not great","This is the first noise cancellation headphone I try and buy, so I have nothing to compare with, but that I have tried it on a long flight, I wish I paid extra and got the Technica one!The sennheiser was comfortable on the ears, but not so much after a few hours of flying. I think the bigger one (the kind that covers your ears) would have been much more comfortable on long trips.I also didn't find its noise cancellation that great! it certainly reduces the plane's engine noise, but probably not more than 60%.My advise is to try other, more expensive, headphones before you buy this one."
4,Nice Headphones for Air Travel,"I had a chance to use the Sennheiser PXC 250 headphones for a holiday airline flight. They really cut down the amibient roar of the jet engines when you are flying. They come with a handy carrying case which easily holds spare batteries and the ipod Nano I was using. In fact, I was able to fit my compact digital camera in the case, as well. They have excellent bass response, much better than the earbuds that came with the Nano. My only complaint is that you can't use the headphones without the noise cancelling ""stick"" which is a little bulky. If they plugged into that module, rather than being hardwired, it would provide more flexibility. Even so, I'd definitely recommend them based on the excellent sound quality and portability provided by the folding design."
2,Would NOT recommend,"I bought this after I cut the wire on my bose headphones by accident.I don't like them, at all.. they are too tight on my ears and there are so many wires they easily get tangled. You can't disconnect the noise canceller, which gets in the way constantly..Sounds isn't that great either, for price. overall, bad purchase."
3,Works Well - Not Great,"I couldn't rationalize $300 plus dollars for Bose Noise Canceling Headphones so I decided to to get something similar on the cheap. I did try the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 and 3 at an outlet mall in Virginia. As a gimick, the display had the low rumbling of an airplane. When wearing these things I couldn't hear the rumbling or my daughter speaking to me while standing right next time. The Sennheiser do reduce outside noises but not to the extent of the Bose Headphones. You can still hear people speaking and the low rumbling is muted. They suit me well enough. With the volume turned up a little bit, I can travel in relative isolation to outside noises."
4,Good Sound,Got these for our son for his travels to and from college. He said he really liked these. The noise reduction worked pretty well. Just has the external battery pack that was a little cumbersome. Half the price of Bose.
4,Sennheiser PXC 250 Noise Canceling Headphone's worth of its price,"This is so far a very good buy for the quality at its price. Although Bose is very good with its noise canceling headphones, but with its tag can scare off many people.If you want a noise canceling headphone yet don't want to spend $300 for one, Sennheiser PXC 250 is a good choice."
4,Good for travel,"I bought two pair of these for an oversees flight. The batteries easily last for the 9 hour flight. They were comfortable, not too hot and had good sound dampening cutting out most of the engine noise. They had good range for music and in-flight entertainment. No where near as good as the bose, but for less than 1/3 the price, I'd recommend them to a friend. Folded up easily for storage."
2,Sennheiser PXC 250 Active Noise Canceling Headphones,"They are okay, not too comfortable for wearing for a long time but good value for money. I'm not sure these types of headphones do anything more than cancel out aircraft noise because when used under other continuous background noise scenarios, like with a lawnmower, they seem to block only the same frequency as for aircraft noise."
2,Not thrilled,"I am not thrilled with these headphones. I purchased them to replace a pair of Logitech NC headphones that my daughter had broken. Sennheiser does not compare. The Logitech headphones canceled the airplane engine noise much better...I don't know if this was because the Logitech headphones were supra-aural while the Logitech are circumaural so the Logitech have an advantage with passive noise blocking..or if the noise canceling electronics are better with the Logitech. The Sennheiser are smaller and fold up into a very compact size but the case won't protect them from crushing. Overall, I'm replacing the Sennheiser with a pair of Audio-Technica (I'd go for another set of Logitech but they are no longer being made and I was disappointed that the swival joint broke)."
5,Don't have to go to Bose.,What can I say other than these headphones are really great. I don't believe Bose can do any better. I have used the Noisebuster brand for 4 years until they conked out. Searching the internet for replacements I found these and decided to try them. I work at the post office where it's very noisy and these puppies cut the noise and let your music play through. Worth every penny.
4,"Good, balanced performance","Very comfortable. Compact for travelling. Good, but not exceptional sound. Good noise cancellation. I do not find the on-off/electronics unit on the cord a drawback. Good for the treadmill. Bose Quiet Comfort 2 had slightly better sound particularly in the bass, but I preferred this overall for its combination of virtues."
4,very good product,"I compared this product with the Panasonic noise cancelling earphones RP-HC55 and the JLab JBuds J2 earphones. In a recent Consumer Reports article, the Panasonic is rated above the Sennheiser unit. Based on noise cancelation/isolation alone, I'd rate the Sennheiser as best, then the Panasonic (to my own surprise) only slightly above the JLab product. Having said that, I am looking forward to products that can do an even better job in noise cancellation/isolation. For music, there are slight differences among these three units, based on different songs/music, but to my ears, not a discernible difference. For noise isolation/cancellation alone, I recommend the Sennheiser product, but one has to place purpose above cost for this feature."
4,Sennheiser PXC 250 Active Noise Canceling Headphones,"Great headphones for the price!Packaging from the sender needs improvement. Should be shipped in a box instead of a bubble mailer. Product arrived OK, but packaging was quite beat up."
4,"Gave as a gift, seems to like it","Gave this to my Dad for Christmas, and he really seems to like them. He really wanted the new Bose ones, but after doing some reading, it seemed like the price tag on the comparable Bose set didn't equate to better performance. My father travels often, and he says these are great and recommends them to his friends and other family. I haven't tried them on the plane, but did try them on, etc...and they seem comfy enough. I have to go off what he says, and he's a pretty tech savvy guy for an older gentleman, so, I'm giving this four stars."
2,Not exactly what I thought.,"It's not you.....it's me so I returned them. I'm sure these are fine headphones but I was looking for something that doesn't exist. I would like to find complete isolating / deprivation headphones. Yes the background noises and humming are cancelled out, but I could still hear conversations, etc.The compact design is nice. Getting used to the cord and battery pack may take some creative measures, unless you have a breast pocket. I guess I'll have to go back to the little foam earplugs."
4,"Works great, although not super comfortable after several hours","I used these on recent international flights and they were great at cutting out loud background noise from the jet engines. You don't realize how awful and wearing the airplane noise level is until you put these on. One drawback: they sit right on your ear and hurt after several hours. For sleeping on flights, old-fashioned dirt-cheap ear plugs work best. But I loved these earphone for when I was awake and wanted some quiet or wanted to listen to my iPod. And they cost a lot less than other noise canceling headphones."
4,"Does the job, and there are better","Pros: They do a good job of noise cancelling, they're light and portable, and don't use up batteries quickly.Cons: They seem a little delicate, and there are other headphones (such as Bose) that cancel much more noise and are more comfortable.For the price, they're great."
2,Dont buy it,"I wanted to buy Bose NC Cans but they are quite expensive and I can't afford that. So, I thought lets give it a try for Sennheiser PXC 250 NC Cans...Pros:1 - Very comfortable2 - Very good packagingCons:1 - Bulky noise cancelling unit half way between the cord2 - Can't bypass that bulky nc unit3 - Sounds EXTREMELY flat without noise cancellation on (Can't emphasize enough!!!). There is literally no bass if you turn off the noise cancelling. My 20$ Sony headphones sound EXACTLY the same if you turn on the noise cancellation4 - Cancels only about 50 % of the ambient noise (can hear people talking)5 - Cheap case6 - Folding the headphones is a little trickyDont buy them. I am probably going to return them."
3,Not as good as my bose QC2,"I bought these at the same time as a bose quiet headphone set. The bose are much more quiet and higher quality sound. The little dangle on this set is very annoying, at least for what I use them for, and they are a pain to travel with. On the up side, they're a reasonable value at 1/3 the cost of the bose.For the money, a decent buy. If you're looking for comfort, ease of use, and overall performance at a (much) higher price, then the bose quiet headphones are a definite step up. I just ordered my second set of bose (wife took the first set!) and these are relegated to the backup pile."
4,Good for the price,"I have used these headphones on planes and at work, and they're a good value. They work reasonably well, and the sound quality is very good.I don't like the offboard electronics. It's cumbersome in practice, but seemed like a good thing when I was deciding what to buy. Also, the cord isn't very long. It's fine for just sitting down, or if you're plugged into an MP3 player that's also on your body, but not good if you're plugged into a PC. You'll need an extension.These headphones are great for walking. They cancel any slight wind sound, and I heard things in songs I had never heard before, which is a good thing. I can get more volume out of less expensive headphones, but with these I'm ok with lower volume, because the sound is so good.I tried a friend's large Bose noise canceling headphones on a plane, and when you turned them on you heard zero outside noise. They're exceptional, but they're also more than twice the cost."
5,Quiet air travel,"I bought these headphones when I was going to be traveling on a smaller airline which I knew would be noisy. These did what they promised, cut out the buzzing sound from the plane but I was still able to hear people talking. They were light weight and easy to use. A great value for the price."
2,Sound good/design bad + sometimes shocks?,"These headphones are great for noise cancelling. I just wanted to warn people about the design. The battery pack is right in the middle of the cable so sitting at my desk I have to take the headphones off if I move my chair back at all. Sometimes I forget to do this and the pack falls off my desk, which has resulted in the clip for the batteries to break. Also, sometimes I'll get small electric shocks through the headphones. This hasn't happened with any other headphones that I've used."
4,Headphones are Great...Noise Filter eats Batteries,"I love the headphones!! What I do not like is the little battery 'cannister' that if it is not on your lap or a table tugs at the headsphones. Also, the noise filter only seems to have 40 hours of life before it starts improperly filtering the noise. I just ended up turning off the filter, resulting in a muffled airplane hiss. I recommend these headphones for comfort & sound quality, just be prepared to carry extra batteries."
1,broke down after 6 uses,"I bought these headphones about 2 months ago and only used them 6 times. They no longer work (and yes I checked the batteries). I tried to get an exchange or have them fixed but the Amazon dealer, Electronics Expo said that they have no liability so it is my tough luck.On quality, they are OK, sound is not great but good enough for on an airplane, which is where I primarily used them. If you get them, be careful who you order them from. (I'm sure Circuit City or a similar store would have exchanged them on the spot.)"
2,Disappointing quality,"I really liked these headphones when I first got them but the ""relationship"" went down hill oh so very quickly. Within two months of receipt, the on-off slide switch broke off. A few months later the plug developed an intermittent break. Twist the cord just right and you had stereo otherwise only one headphone would work. It finally got so bad that I have put it back into its case and stopped using them. Disappointing for a pair of $100 headphones. These were very lightly used headphones and not thrown around or abused. When not actually in use, they would be in their padded, zippered case. I cannot recommend them for their lack of quality."
4,Most of what I wanted is here.,"I first used these headphones on a school trip to an amusement park. I sat at a table in the food court and they blocked 90% of the conversations of people at other tables and walking past. I was still aware of the roar of the rides and the screams of the riders, but they were sufficiently muted to let me hear the string bass(jazz) in detail. The ability to block out the midrange noise and hear the acoustics of the room and the miking was a delight. I look forward to my flights back to Maine this summer, but I doubt that anything will defeat the noise of a turboprop puddlejumper. I am looking forward to Sennheiser's next model as possible family Christmas gifts.I found these light and comfortable; I have disliked the feel of many previous headphones. I have not tried the Bose. I still want this product to cost less than $80.00."
4,"Great noise reduction, but a little tight and awkward to use","I purchased these for use on the subway and bus, and for use while I eat lunch outside in the middle of Washington DC. The noise reduction is wonderful, but it's noise reduction, NOT elimination. It's amazing what happens when you turn these off after using them for a while and realize how much noise pollution you haven't been subjected to. They are mostly comfortable, but just a little tight. The cords are prone to tangle a bit, but if you're mostly sitting still while you're using these, it shouldn't be a problem.I would recommend these for purchase as long as you're not looking for total silence. These are a great way to reduce your stress from noise pollution, and terrific quality for a very reasonable price."
3,"good electronics, bad design","I have the phones for about a year. The noise cancellation is probably as good as it gets, you still can hear what's going on outside, but the train or city street noise (New York!) is suppressed a lot. However, the design is terrible, First, I did not realize from the picture that the phones are small, and are sitting on my ears, not around them. But the most ugly part which is not on the picture is the amplifier, which is big like a very fat pen or a small sausage, and sits in the middle of the cord, so one has to clip it to something on one's close separately. It might be OK if you are sitting in a plane, but not too good if you are trying to exercise."
2,A major drawback,"These seemed like such a good deal for the price that I purchased a pair for my wife also. I used them for trips in my Miata and also for flying. However, after a year the foam earcups started disintegrating, which I didn't notice until my neck and shirt were covered in black flakes on a flight. While it seemed like it would be easy enough to replace the earcups, the manufacturer no longer carries the replacements, so these are now trash. If you are only going to use these once or twice a year, they are probably fine for you. If you will use them more, go with a better quality like the Bose. The Bose seem expensive initially, but not if you only have to purchase one pair instead of two like me."
1,Not good at all,"I was really disappointed by these headphones. Due to the small size of the earpieces they don't really provide much isolation. While using them on a flight (which is why I got them in the first place), I had to turn up the volume just to hear the music, and these headphones had no bass at all, just high-end. I ended up getting a pair of JVC HANC250 noise cancelling headphones which work much better and don't have the ridiculous power pack that come with these Sennheisers."
4,Good Noise reduction,"I purchased two pairs of the Sennheiser PXC 250 for a trip chicago to rome. Given the long duration of the flight, I felt it would be worthwhile to use noise canceling headphones to make the flight tolerable. I found these headphones to fit the need. Although there is still some background noise, the difference between having these headphones on with noise canceling on and not is very significant. I would recommend these headphones highly as they are affordable and effective."
2,Not worth it at any price,"I bought these headphones based on a good review at Tom's Hardware, but I am sorely disappointed in them. The noise cancellation feature does work (15dB only), but the sound quality is really bad. The biggest complaint is that the bass is severely attenuated, but the mid-range and highs also sound uneven -- as though the frequency response is not very flat. My 16-year old son thinks the inexpensive Panasonic headphones that came with his $49 CD player ""sound a lot better"". Maybe these just need to get broken in, but if they sound this bad when new, I'm not going to wait -- I'm returning them. I would not buy these at $20, and certainly not at $100+."
3,NC not work so well,"I did a shot fight traval last month and took the new buying PXC250 headphone. But I found the NC was not so strong to eliminate the roaringand wheezy in the deck, cause I did not experience the feel of calm that described by other people. That might be attributed to the too short flight that I need to balance the pressure in my ear all the time. I'll try it on a long distance trip. The bottom line is the headphone gave the real good sound"
1,Not worth it...,"I've been searching for a pair of headphones with noise cancellation and great sound... they're all 'not that great'. The sound level is too low, there's no bass (especially with the noise cancellation off, only a bit better with it on), etc. Instead, I'm switching back to my Koss PortaPro headphones... they're AMAZING, a lot less money, don't require batteries... and believe me, no matter how ugly they look, they're almost as great as $400 over the ear giant audiophile headphones.... I'm super happy with the Koss PortaPro, but not all that happy with these.... actually, I'm quite disappointed in them!"
1,Avoid these,"I've had a pair of these for about 3 years with almost no use (only use on long flights). They barely muffle exterior sound. My biggest complaint is that the earpieces have literally disintegrated. This started when they were 6 months old. The leather cover disconnected as did the foam padding. So each earpiece is a ball us mush, and that is with them being stored and transported in their own case."
1,Not up to my expectations,"I bought these headphones to provide a reduction in distracting noise when I was trying to listen to audio in a public environment. The reduction was not really satisfactory, so I returned the headphones to Amazon (I must say that the return process was smooth and easy, with refund also on my return postage).In retrospect: It may be that I expected too much from headphones that do not enclose the ears."
2,Disappointing Christmas Gift,"Five members of my family tested this and none of them found it at all helpful. At this cost, I was confident that I had solved my parents noise problems. Apparently there just isn't a product out there that really cancels anything, but apparently Noise Reducing Headphones just won't sell."
2,Too Fragile for Travel,"I bought this unit for travel but, a year later, it's headed for the trash. I liked the fact that it folded down to fit easily into my carry-on bag, but the wires had to be wrapped awkwardly around the folded headphones and, after perhaps a dozen uses, the wires failed. The headphones now work only if I stretch out the wires with one hand and hold the connection point between plug and airplane at precisely the correct angle with the other. I have to say that the sound, volume control and noise canceling qualities were quite satisfactory, but my next set of headphones will have a sturdier design."
3,Works great - didn't last,"These were awesome headphones. Good sound, noise cancelatio worked as advertised. The cons?: Very bulky. Right headphone started to die with crackling and distortion after about a year. Headphones are dead now, after one year of heavy use. Maybe be more careful with them than I was."
2,Should be called Noise Reducing Headphones,"Just returned from an airline trip where I tried out my new Sennheiser phones for the first time. Based on reviews here and elsewhere I was not expecting complete noise cancellation, but I would estimate these phones only reduced the jet engine noise by less than fifty percent. Pressing the phones closer to my ears improved the performance somewhat, but I have to wonder if it is worth the effort to haul these phones onto the plane if they only reduce the noise by half or less. On the other hand, I have used the phones with a new Phillips portable DVD player and find them to work well with this device, though you do need to have the noise cancellation turned on to get better, full sound. The phones are very comfortable to wear and fold up easily for compact storage in the provided case."
4,A good travel headphone.,"PXC-250 is a lifesaver if you listen to music on trains, busses, and airplanes. However, the noise cancelling does not do much against other types of noise (such as street / traffic noise) or low-level noise such as an air conditioner. The sound quality is good, but what you're really paying for here is its active reduction. If you're looking for an outdoor / indoor headphone, try the Sennheiser PX-200 or PX-100, or something from the Grado Labs line of 'phones."
2,Kevin C,"When I first purchased these headphones I was impressed with their comfort and the noise cancelling capabilities. They are comfortable and they do cancel noise. The design reliability however, does not keep pace with the sonic qualities of the headphones. After two years of light usage the plastic pivot point that attaches the ear piece to the headset broke away and the headphones weren't usable. Great ride while it lasted."
4,Sennheiser PXC250 Headphones,"Headphones work as advertised. Turn them on and ambient noise disappears. My only problem with them was the lack of adjustment in fit. For complere noise suppresion, you need a good fit on the ear. I could not get a good fit and they remained loose resulting in noise pollution. My wife tried them on and they fit her fine. She is now their owner. I on the other hand will turn to an over the ear design to provide the desired effect."
2,Disappointing,I bought these headphones to use of long haul flights but discovered that they were only marginally effective at doing what they were supposed to do - at least on big jets.I borrowed a passengers bose headphones and what a differences. I guess you get what you pay for.
5,Hoover Windtunnel electronic vacuum cleaner S3765-040,"Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister VacuumWow- A terrific vacuum. Today we received the vacuum and today we had our house professionally cleaned.After the professionals left, I set up the vacuum (very easy to do) and vacuumed the carpet in our family room. I was amazed at the amount of dirt the professional vacuum left behind.Very well designed, great written instructions and very easy to use.A great buy."
4,good for the price,"I recently was relocated to a new cube at my office and the surrounding neighbors are quite noisy. I bought these in hopes of retaining my sanity in the work place while not putting a huge dent in my budget (i.e. I really didn't want to spend $300 on the Bose). Overall, these work pretty well. They dampen all but the loudest of my office mates and produce decent quality sound. I do have to be selective in what music I listen to in order to benefit the most from the sound reduction - continuous melodies such as classical pieces or celtic. All in all I'm quite happy and my blood pressure has returned to normal."
4,Great headphones for the price,"I bought these after leaving a cheap pair of Sony's in the rain..ooops..and breaking a set of JBL (the JBL were terrible). Both bought at a large supermart. The compactness is great for traveling, the noise cancelling isn't any better than the cheaper Sony's (don't know model number) but worked great and the sound is awesome. I used them on a trip to Peru last month and had them on for 8 hours without discomfort as some people complained about in other posts. The battery pack is a bit annoying but no big deal when on a plane.All in all, I really like these headphones."
2,very disappointing,"I have been traveling with a pair of Sony MDR-NC11 noise canceling headphones for years. When they broke right before a holiday trip I decided to try these. Sennheiser usually makes very good products and this pair of headphones seemed perfect for travel and was almost half the price of the Sony pair I had been using.While they were light and easily folded into a nice storage pouch, the noise reduction unit was large and inconvenient. The sound quality was extremely disappointing. Even setting the bass on my ipod or video player at max it made little difference. The 'noise cancellation' slightly muted the sound of the plane engines, but did nothing to help with the voices and crying babies nearby. After 6 hours the pressure of the earphones on my ears started to hurt quite a bit.I returned them immediately and will gladly pay the extra money for the Sony pair."
3,Just OK,"I travel quite frequently and these flights range from 1hr flights to trans oceanic trips. I tried a pair of Bose headphones a few years ago that a fellow in the seat next to me had. I was quite impressed and amazed that so much ambient noise just disappeared. First, I'm no fan of Bose products. I have a pretty high-end dedicated cinema in my home and I would never allow a Bose product in there. I had high hopes for the Sennheisers despite the price being less than 1/3 that of the Bose. They do work but just not to the same level as the Bose. I've worn them twice on flights and the background noise was reduced. Passenger and flight attendant voices were muted, but definitely audible. I did find them comfortable, light and the case easily fit into my computer bag. I paid less than $90 and for that price, I'd say they are a good buy when compared to a $300 pair of Bose."
3,noise reducing headphones review,Great noise reducing capability. I hate the external battery pack. I replaced them for this reason.
3,"Good headphones, but...","The headphones are quite good. However, the battery-powered noise cancelling device is quite cumbersome. You have to hook it to a pocket to keep it out of the way. I should have bought the more expensive Bose.Good luck."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"As noise reducing headphones these are as good as they can be considering they do not enclose one's ears, but the sound quality makes them unusable for everyday use. Using them to watch movie trailers I noticed I could not hear the voice over in the trailers. The sound effects and music I think sounded okay, but I could not hear the voice over. I thought it was the trailer so I switched to a pair of $5 earbuds and could hear the voices fine."
4,Very good noise canceling. Wires a pain.,"The noise canceling is very good. I bought the headphonesfor commuting on the Long Island Railroad (a New York Citycommuter railroad) and was wanted to reduce ambient noise.The mechanical train noise is reduced considerably.People's voices less so, but someone's words arow or two away from me, are reduced to unintelligiblemumbling; a good thing! The headphones however do littleto help block off someone sitting right next to me or veryclose by. But that's OK since Sennheiser doesn't claim thatthese headphones will block voices at all.My only gripe is that the wires become easily tangled. There'sno way to physically unhook the external noise-cancelingcylinder. Since I continually keep my AM/FM radio attached,the wires seem perpetually to need a difficult untangling session.My guess is that it's only a matter of time before the wires break,or they get stressed to the point of shorting.Still overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
3,Uncomfortable to wear,"The headphones are not Sennheiser's best product. They do perform reasonably well but are ""tiresome"" with lenghty use. I have two of their top line headphones and will probably take a set on my next plane trip.The first set I purchased were defective with static in the right earphone, and Amazon.com replaced them immeditately, with no problems. Applause to Amazon.com.But I would tell the buyer who is willing to fork out a $100 or so for this headset, to spend another $100 and get one of Sennheiser's audiophile series."
3,"Good sound, moderately effective, flimsy","I've used the headsets for about 20 flights so far. I chose them in preference to the Bose noise-cancelling headphones because of 1) cost, 2) comfort, and 3) sound quality. They proved to be very convenient (for music listening, as well as noise cancellation). Not nearly as good as suppressing noise as Bose set, but this is mostly due to construction--the Sennheiser are light and fit over the ear; the Bose are heavier and surround the ear. On the other hand, these are more comfortable to wear (less sweating, and can also hear the flight attendant).The sound quality is very good, and it works even without batteries.My biggest complaint is the switch broke after 6 months (I have to poke it with a toothpick to operate): it uses a very thin plastic connector. I wish this part, which moves all the time, was a bit sturdier.--inotherworlds.com"
2,"Great sound, atrocious design","Sennheiser PXC 250 Active Noise Canceling HeadphonesOther reviewers have mentioned the spaghetti-like wiring on these. The inferior phone plug connection is less immediately evident but more troubling over time.If you use yours daily, as I do on my NYC subway commute, the connection between headphone wire and phone plug will begin to fray in very short order. Soon you'll be left with one channel of sound, and a bit later, no sound at all. Not a good product for those who don't like a tangle of wires that will become useless scrap before long."
2,Good sound - poor design,"While these headphones sound good, they're poorly designed and will eventually fall apart. To use the noise cancelling feature, there is a switch which you must remember to turn off or your batteries will die. After a year of normal use, the left earpiece fell off and the hinge mechanism for the batteries broke. It's all being held together with glue and rubber bands now!"
3,White Noise,"There is some noise compensation (I think) but there is also white noise generation; there is a hiss at low volumes. When listening to music, I have to have the volume turned up to compensate for the white noise. I have no other noise compensation make to compare the PXC 250s to, but they are portable and better than other portable earphones I have used. The earphones do not compensate for loud voices in a cubicle across the aisle. I suspect Bose may be better, but are they twice as good at twice the price?"
5,"Good quality, fair price - what else can you ask for?","I've had these headphones for 2 months and have used them on planes and in the office - to listen to music, watch movies, and watch web content. The quality is superb, the headphones are comfortable, and when folded they easily fit in my laptop bag's front pocket. They're so comfortable, my 2-year-old happily wore them while watching a movie on the plane! I'd highly recommend these as the best value for your dollar."
2,Disappointed,I was expecting more from the this product based on the reviews. I do not recommend these headphones for use on planes.
2,Wish it came with instructions,This thing works sporadically. I don't understand why it didn't come with some directions. I am a novice for sure with any type of technology; but a pretty quick study when provivded direction. I finally gave up on it and use my IPOD ear phones.
2,Disappointing Sound Quality,"I bought these headphones expecting a middle-of-the-line noise-canceling headset, but I am not impressed. I currently have theV-Moda Vibe Earbudsbut I wanted something better for an upcoming trip. I have small ears so finding a small headset is hard, but this is a good size, and this liked it would do the trick. These headphones give absolutely terrible sound quality if the NoiseGard is not turned on, and when it is turned on, I can definitely still hear things around me. If I can hear my cat purring while listening to music, how is this going to help muffle a jet engine?!?Even knowing the price meant this wasn't the top of the line, I certainly expected much more than this."
2,Not very much value here... hardly different than regular earbuds,"At best, they are a qualified ""ok"". Not much different from earbuds...You can hardly tell the difference when in a noisy background."
4,saved from the 13 hour flight,"I just tried this product out to and from Denver a 2-1/2 hour flight and it worked good. The real test is the 13 and 15 hour flights next week. I am confident these will help for sure.product is good quality, received quickly."
2,Worked fine till they Broke !,"I was pleased with these headphones until last week. On a flight home, the left ear piece developed an extremely loud, high pitched squeal which has rendered this $100 purchase unusable. I was disappointed as I would expect a bit more mileage out of a product this expensive. A check of the Sennheiser website shows there are no longer warranteed so I am out of luck."
4,Solid headphones.,"I don't have anything to compare them to, but they seem to work just fine. I used them on a long flight to cancel out the engine noise. There was still an audible hum from the engine, but the difference was huge. I did notice the slight pain/pressure sensation in my ears but it was not too bad.Great design, small and foldable."
2,Returned them for a re-fund,"This is the first product I have returned to Amazon!They just where no good on an aiplane, tried them on 4 planesMD-80, 757, and two flights on 747-400.The noise in my ears was less with out them on."
3,"Great, except that ...","after seven months, using them in the gym, they developed an intermittent connection in the cord, about where it goes into the part that holds the battery, and so now they have a large pop every couple of minutes, or the left channel dies, so, ultimately, while they were very good for the money when I bought them, the did not last, and I have to figure out how to get them replaced."
5,Outstanding!,"I have been interested in Sennheiser headphones for a few years now, since Consumer Reports has rated this as a 'best buy' for a few years. Now that I've used my set for the past month, I have been very excited about the quality. For my commuter train (BART - San Francisco Bay Area), it's very loud at times, but I only need to turn the loudness halfway up my new iTouch and I can hear my favorite radio talk shows or music. It amazes me that it blocks outside noise so well. I would highly recommend this product, especially if you don't have an extra $300 - $400 around for the highest quality headsets."
2,Can't handle office interference,"I tried these out in a local HiFi store and found them to be very nice headphones. The sound was quite 'tinny' with the noise-cancelling circuit off, but a very rich and beautiful sound with the circuit engaged.However, I ended up having to return them. It turns out that the circuit wasn't shielded against 2.4GHz spectrum, and in the office it suffered an incessant humm from the 2.4GHz devices. Most disappointing and I had expected more from a product designed to cancel noise in the office (I had purchased with the intent being to use them in the office, and for travel).I would buy them again in a flash if they produced a model that was shielded from interference."
3,Amazing,I am a pre-med student living in a house where loud music and parties occur almost everynight. With this amazing technology I can study in quiet while the noise in house is equivalent to a night club. They are also good for sleeping.
3,"Good headphones, noise cancelling questionable.","These headphones sound pretty good. But I'm not sure how effective the noise cancelling is. That's not to say that they don't actually cut out a little of the outside noise. But, in my opinion, slightly worse than loosely worn cotton buds. I've personally found that isolation type headphones with a good fit do just as well if not better. And they cost a lot less.I must admit that I've only tried these and one other pair of cheap noise canceling headphones. I haven't had the opportunity to test a pair of the Bose. But from the reviews I've read, these are just about the same. But, just in case I'm wrong, I'm not yet going to condemn the entire category of headphones, just these.They sound pretty good. And they are fairly light and comfortable. But the noise canceling module is bulky and inconvenient.But because of the negatives, I no longer use these. Anyone want to buy them off of me, cheap?"
2,Product was fine the shipper was not which is Tiger Direct.com,"2 adapters were missing from this shipment....policy of Tiger Direct is that I had to ship back the item instead of having the small parts shipped to me. Repacked it, got a UPS label, went to a UPS store...They, hopefully, will credit my Amazon account and then I can order again. The first customer service agent at Tiger Direct hung up on me so I had to call back and received the instructions necessary to follow thru with their policy and need for the item. I asked to speak to a supervisor and got a voice mail and no return call has been made to me in response to my complaints and/or questions.Amazon is great, the product appeared fine (what I received of it) but I would not deal with Tiger Direct again."
3,It is okay but NOT GooD enough.,"The headphone is well designed, light, fairly comfortable to wear. However the noise cancelling part is not as expected. It appears that noise can only be reduced by about 60%-70% on plane,or on a noisy street. Ear cups for sure ard too SMALL and the quality for Stereo music listening operation is about the level of a $25.00 Sony Headset."
2,Noise canceling headphones to block out office noise,"I bought the headphones to block out office noise but I can still hear what's going on. I didn't try them on an airplane so can't comment on how they do in that environment. A colleague who owns Bose headphones told me that while his headphones do well on a plane, they don't do well in an office environment. It seems that engine noise can be blocked out but not the sound of conversations, tapping on computer keys, etc."
1,Sennheiser PXC 250 generates noise,"These headphones start out with white noise. Then in about 30 seconds generate a loud crakeling noise. I wanted to return them. But unfortunately, I discarded the packageing before I had a chance to use them on a flight."
1,BAD SWITCH,"The headset is light weight, confortable sounds great when it works. It's to bad this headset's on/off switch is built so poorly. To operate the switch is difficult and after a couple of uses, it broke. After retruning two sets, one new and one reconditioned, I am buying something else. You should to."
3,It's good but not the best !,"I am writing this review while using this product for the first time ;-). I have great expectations for this product by seeing the reviews. It's good but not exceeded my expectations (with this price).As a headphone good. As a noise cancellation it's AVG. Because, it never cancels all the noise around you. That's for sure. Only say 65 to 70% of noise.Final suggestion, if you are looking for only noise cancellation there is no other option than this (BOSE is there, which is too expensive). If you are looking for a decent headphone go for a 10$ one next door.Good luck,Ram"
2,Not that great....,I had great expectations when I bought this headphones. This some how cuts off 50% of the noise. The worst part of it is that it adds a HISS to when Noise Cancelling is switched on.
4,Headphones are great,"The headphones are great, I use them all the time. Right now, in fact, I am wearing them to block out my room mate's snoring. They were a great buy."
5,Sennheiser Noise Canceling Headphones,I am very impressed with the headphones. On a recent trip I was in a seat next to the engine and the headphones did an excellent job canceling the engine noise.
2,Bad quality,Noise cancellation is acceptable for the price. But I've hardly used them and already the NoiseGard pack's on-off switch is loose and causing problems with left-right headphone sound. And its not in Warranty anymore so I won't even bother trying to get them fixed.
4,Sennheiser Pxc250 headphones,"The headphones come in a bag complete with adapters for 6mm jack and aircraft type sockets. They are lightweight and comfortable and the noise cancellation works well. The quality of the sound is excellent with noise cancellation switched on, the bass is less well reproduced with the noise cancellation switched off but battery life seems to be very good. Stereo separation is also excellent. Excellent value for money."
3,Bulky Device,"Pros:- Solid construction- Very nice sound- Good noise cancellingCons:- Heavy and awkward battery/electronics deviceSummary:Great build quality, great sound and noise cancelling. However, the battery compartment/noise cancelling electronics make for a large package that is awkward to locate. Halfway between the headphones and the 3.5mm jack is a cigar sized unit that contains the battery and noise cancelling pieces (and is quite heavy). Everything works well and the sound is great, but the extra package is awkward to locate and carry. I would rather have the electronics, etc. as part of the headset, but for the price, I can't complain much."
4,Awesome Headphones,"I received ""Sennheiser PXC 250 Active Noise Canceling Headphones"" as my Bday gift from my friend...and it is the best gift I could have got. It has simple and no nonsense design. The headphone nice fit the ears. Mind you its not wrap your whole ears. Just enough ...optimum.First, I used it without its noise canceling feature and its performance was good. But when I put two AAA batteries in the holder provided...it rocked !! Simply Amazing.Only disadvantage I can see is the extra holder for noise canceling feature. It comes attached and cannot be detached, but normal headphone function is carried out without batteries.Overall, Sennheiser PXC 250 is an exciting product...totally worth it."
3,Decent noise cancelling headphones,"The thing that hangs off the headphone wire (presumably what powers the noise canceling feature) is pretty clunky. But for the price, it's a decent set of noise canceling headphones."
4,Great headphone for the price,"These headphones met my expectations. I use the noise canceling option when I travel by plane, and it blocks out enough noise to make listening to music a pleasure. I don't have to crank up the volume, like i did with ordinary headphones anymore. They are fairly comfortable as well."
4,"Great for long trips, but the mini plug is fragile","I fly a lot. This is my second pair of 250's, since the plug on my first one developed an intermittent short. It cost almost as much to replace the plug as it cost to buy a new pair. The new pair appears to have an improved plug, but I wish it was a 90 degree type instead of a straight plug.These are the best noise canceling phones I've tried. I started with the Bose over-ear headphones, but found them too heavy for long flights. Although the battery pack on the 250 seems a bit awkward at first, it keeps the weight of the batteries off your head. It's a good compromise. Highly recommended."
4,Pretty Good,"This does have good sound quality, but I was a little disappointed. Maybe it's just because the other reviews were so positive that my expectations were too high. It doesn't seem to cup my ear enough to really block out enough of the outside sound. (If you hold them in close to your ear so no other noise can get in, the sound is amazing)I did work pretty decent at the gym, where there is so much noise that I usually have my iPod on at full volume with the standard earbuds. I was able to have it at a regular volume setting using these headphones. They are pretty comfortable. They fold up nice and come with a travel case, that is large enough to also hold an ipod. The wires can tangle easy.Also, the ""tunnel"" noise that you get if you don't have the noise cancelling switch on is really bad, so bring extra batteries if you're on a long trip because you won't want to use the headphones if can't use the noise cancelling feature with them."
5,"Must-have for long flights, great for short flights","I bought these because of my frequent plane trips. For you international travelers these are a must-have. When my plane landed after nine hours in flight, I felt less fatigued than without the headphones. Usually, I feel worn out from the constant din in the cabin. With normal headphones you can barely hear the in-flight movie. With these I could hear the dialog without straining - it was actually enjoyable."
5,made wonderful gift for western fan,"This was a great addition to my friends Gunsmoke collection. It features Chester,before Festus character. Well done,old western,enjoyed by most anyone."
5,Great Western,Love the characters in Gunsmoke. They seem like old friends. It's amazing how Matt always wins all the gun fights.
5,Met my expectations!,"The quality of these remastered videos on DVD was excellent and was the stories in the 6th season. Very, very enjoyable."
5,Nice product & good value,"I got this in an effort to minimize all the clutter in my cabinets, and I'm very happy with this little juicer. I still use the juicer attachment to my stand mixer for larger jobs, but for everyday use when cooking, this little juicer is great. I like that I can juice just one lemon or lime for a recipe and I can also measure the amount with the same piece of equipment. So often, a recipe will call for just a tablespoon or so of juice, and this way I don't have to dirty up a larger juicer and then a measuring spoon. I also like the non-slip padding on the underside."
1,Progressive Citrus Juicer,It is a nice size but I too plan to return this item. The white plastic juicer part won't remain in the clear base. The least amount of pressure makes it pop-up and off of the base. This is a very messy problem for a product of this type. The plastic is thinner and lighter than I expected too. It isn't worth the money or the aggravation.
2,Badly manufactured...,I love the design of this juicer but I plan to return it because the base does not fit together with the juicer and lid.
4,Very effective juicer,"This little guy does the job on citrus. We bought it as a supplement for Lemonade Stand days when we have several people juicing. The reservoir is very small - two lemons can cause an overflow. Because of the markings, I thought the top could also be used as a reservoir, but it is not currently designed to work that way. It's perfect for small quantities."
5,"Great juicer, portable. Great value.",This juicer is great for the lemons I use. It does the job well and the bottom portion tells me how much juice I have. Rinses easily off. I transport mine from home to work. The top cover is great keeping the juicer clean. The top portion is great if you want to measure out larger quantities. I have no spilling issues using bottom portion. The quality is excellent and I feel I got a great value. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a practical and good citrus juicer.
5,Excellent,"I use this mostly for making lemon meringue pies. The little circle at the bottom holds the juicer tight to the counter's surface with no slippage and I put a fair amount of force into juicing the lemons. It gets as much juice out of a lemon as the old way of using the back of a spoon to crush the cells and it shows you with each squeeze how much you've accumulated. Easy to clean, very handy! I recommend it."
3,does the trick,"This gadget is aesthetically pleasing and does the trick. You won't be able to use the top cover to push down fruit. It is not sturdy enough. But for the price, it's a nice item to have around the kitchen."
4,nice little kitchen tool,"This is exactly as it says it will be. I have used it for oranges and lemons and both work out just fine. For the price, it works great. I like the measurement options too. It arrived timely."
4,Great little juicer for the price!,"For a small kitchen needing an occasional amount of juice from a lemon or lime this one is perfect! I use it when needing a lemon or two, or lime or two juiced, and it is easy, compact, works perfectly & it is a quick wash, put up even in a small kitchen until the next time."
2,doesn't hold much,"this juicer only can be used with the small bottom part. i thought the larger dome side could be used interchangeably, but i think it is really just a cover for the reamer portion of the juicer. there is no lip on it to fit with the dome. the base of the juicer holds up to 1/4 cup. it has a spout, but if you are making something like pitchers of lemonade this is not sufficient for it unless you have a lot of time on your hands. The reamer part is also ver wide and tall and the skimmer holes are narrow and clog up with pulp whil the juice squirts all over the place. for the money, it does a fair job, but i am disappointed. it has tipped over a few times too because the base is so shallow. i do not recommend this product."
2,Not quite what I thought it was.,"When I opened up the box I couldn't stop laughing. It looked like something you would find in a child's play kitchen. However once I tried to juice with it, it performed pretty good. I do not think it will hold up for any length of time and be careful not to press to hard on the orange when you are squeezing the juice out as I am sure it would break. It looks like something that should be sold in the Dollar Store but it works!"
4,"Small juicer, works well!","As a small juicer, this item works very well. Definitely worth the price. Not sure how it will hold up, time will tell."
3,Color not as pictured,"I have seen this item in stores in orange color, and ordered this one because it was pictured in white. What I got was orange. If the color matters to you, use caution."
2,not good,"This product is probably meant for use with lime/lemon but not orange... its very small, not sturdy, theres always the feeling that its gonna fall down ... i dont think its meant for daily use... its probably more for show/display on the kitchen shelf sort of use and one in a while actual squeezing"
1,Picture and product received are different,Cannot get in touch with a person through Amazon. First time I am truly disappointed with a product. The item I was sent is 'ORANGE' and it seems miniature. This juicer might work well for lemons and limes and very small clementimes.
1,Edging Shreds,"After two washings, the edging shredded, making the washcloth unusable for guests and making it an early candidate for washing the car. The problem is a duplicate of the problem I saw with the edging of a PEM America bath towel, which also shredded after only a few uses. These products are lightly used and their failure to stand up in light use speaks against a recommendation. Conclusion: find another manufacturer."
2,A Pox On All Their Houses,"Mostly the producer for even conceiving of the session, the rhythm section for taking the gig and Po' Lightnin' for seemingly not even being aware there were a bassist and drummer present. Kinda cool to hear him play the electric guitar, though. Don't get me wrong, Lightnin' is one of my faves, but not this date."
4,"Great toys for small mouths, but not for strong chewers","I'm always looking for small fetch balls for my 15 pound dogs. They love to play fetch, but their mouths are so small that normal sized balls (like a tennis ball) just don't work well. These balls are great -- they're soft and very small, but my terrier was able to chew right through one in less than an hour. I removed the squeaker so they wouldn't swallow it, and they still enjoy playing with the ball, but I'd definitely keep an eye on your chewer while playing with this ball.Also, just a word of advice, I wouldn't let any dog over 20 pounds play with these. They are so small that bigger dogs could easily swallow them whole."
2,Vocal Mix Stands Alone,"Wow, I would have expected more from the pumpkins on this one. Well, Billy's not the one who does all the remixes, so I've still got full faith in him. Track #1 (Vocal Mix) is even better than the original 1979. The last three, however, don't even sound like the song. They don't have the lyrics or remotely sound like anything familiar... you can't even dance to it! So, if you like paying 10+ bucks for one song, go for it. If not, get some other Pumpkins stuff!"
4,Buy it for the Moby Mix,"This is one of the better Smashing Pumpkins remix CDs, if not the best, which may not be saying much, but it's worth its price and more just for the Moby Mix. The song doesn't sound much like the original, but is a great song for that reason. I'm a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan, and 1979 has always been one of my favorite songs. The other mixes aren't bad either, certainly not offensive like remixes have a tendency to be. Other people seem to really enjoy the first track, but give the Moby Mix a few good listens to relax, zone out, or my favorite: Play Little Nemo Dream Master for Nintendo - I can't explain it but me and a few of my friends love playing that game with this song on repeat playing."
4,short and sweet,"When I bought 'Calling all Stations' I didn't know what to expect.But I found myself listening to 'Calling all Stations' even more than any other Genesis album.Now I'll admit that 'shipwrecked' isn't my favourite on the album.But after you listen to it for a while,it grows on you.But anyways,I basically bought the cd to hear the new versions of 'no son of mine','lovers leap',and 'turn it on again' with Ray Wilson on vocals.Now I don't have anything against acoustic sets,being a guitar player and all I love them.And these reign superb.EXCEPT for the fact that they're all shortened.You only get about half of 'no son of mine' and they skip a total verse in 'turn it on again'.But if your looking for a new sound of Genesis,this cd is for you.But if you wanna hear the whole versions of the songs,then I wouldn't waste my time......"
3,Get the remastered edition,"A remastered edition of this album was released in 2005, with three bonus tracks, but with the alternate version of ""Summertime"" removed."
2,Outdated Collection,"Since more thorough compilations now exist, many with better sound, this CD is not worth looking into, and only those seeking a slim collection of hits on a single disc should investigate. No liner notes."
4,Great reference.,"A great reference for beginners, with a great approach to teaching. The book focuses more upon tactical situations, than upon the techniques. In other words: opponent is moving forward, here are some things you can do. If s/he stiffens or pulls back, try this or this.Most judo books take the approach: here is an osoto-gari, here are a couple of ways to use it.I think the book's tactical focus is a great method; buy this book if you need a beginner's reference (or a teacher's manual)."
2,A little boring,"I am a 14 year old who was forced to read this book for a school project, and personally, I think it's boring and senceless."
4,Typical Buffett Formula,"Over the years, you come to expect certain things when you listen to a Jimmy Buffett record. Caribbean rhythms, a couple of ballads, and song titles that cleverly twist a familiar saying. Last Mango In Paris provides all of these ingredients. You end up with a good recording, although not one of Buffett's best works. The title track and ""If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me"" are perfect examples of how Buffett can turn a phrase into a song lyric.I've been listening to Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band for almost 25 years now, and the reason is simple: no matter where I am, no matter what the weather, I can throw on a Jimmy Buffett CD and instantly be transported to a beach somewhere on an island, complete with warm summer breezes, cold beer, free from all worries. And in the end, what more can you ask from a record?"
3,Average Buffet,"This cd has 3 or 4 songs on it that are pretty good, though none are great. The rest of the cd is only so-so. If you like JB, you will enjoy this cd, but there probably are 10 or more other Buffet cds that are better."
2,not one of JB's best,"I am a huge Jimmy Buffett fan and I love just about all of his albums, this is not one of them. Frank and Lola, Gypsies in the Palace, and Last Mango in Paris are the strong points of this album. The rest of the album is dull and boring. The last song on this album, ""Beyond the End"" should have been name ""Over the Top"". This song is probably the worst most boring, dull, and unimaginative song Jimmy ever wrote. I do not reccomend this album."
2,"No Mangos, No More","There are a few good songs here, and I really enjoy listening to the song ""Last Mango,"" but overall, most of his other albums are far superior."
4,More Fabulous Sidney Bechet,"When I first started listening to jazz, I never cared much for him. That earthquake-like vibrato of his kept me from appreciating his true artistry as much as I should have. Later on though, I could hear how much life he added to sessions by the likes of Jelly Roll Morton and the New Orleans Feetwarmers. One listen to the 12 numbers in this set by the Haitian Orchestra was enough for me, and it caused me to take a star off this review. This was perhaps unfair, because most of this 4 CD set is great (My favorite is the 2 versions of ""My Daddy Rocks Me"", with its' hilarious lyrics, earthy vocals, and especially his exciting licks. And also the blues and sessions with Jelly Roll). He was a true soul man and pioneer."
5,Wonderful work by a brilliant writer!,"There are/were a few great writers in the world, and William Goyen is one of them. As I was reading this book, I felt that I was transported back 2,000 years living as a contemporary of Jesus. This is one of the few books that I have read where I dreaded when I would finish reading it. I just wanted it to go on and on and on.Whether you are Christian or not, this book is a beautiful gift to the world. Goyen, generally, is so unappreciated as a writer. But what a Master he is! Goyen and John Gardner are my two favorite authors of the 20th century. READ this book before you die!!!"
5,I love this Bedding,I searched for months for bedding for our baby girl.When I found this on Amazon I bought it immediately because it was at such a good price. It is so perfect.The bedding is really good quality material. My favorite pieces are the quilt and bumper.Anyone who visits our nursery comments on how cute the bedding is. I am so happy we purchased it.
2,Need cleaning before use!,"My set was arrived dirty, with some stains on it. Instead of going through the returning hassle, I had to have it cleaned before use. The quality of this cribset is so-so, comparable to $80-100 sets that you can find in local babiesrus or target store. But no way it can cost close to $200. The listing price is misleading."
5,Higher learning from the Bass Professor!,"Hand's down, this has to be the best reference manual for Bass fishing ever to be published. Whether you are just starting out, or a pro on the circuit, you will learn to catch the lunker you have always dreamed of, or you will atleast avoid the embarassment of coming home empty handed. At first I was skeptical, and had no prior knowledge of Doug Hannon until a friend of mine told me about the Bass Professor. His book has truly shed a whole new light on my thought process of Bass fishing! It has a quick on the water reference section to tell you when to use what type of lure, and under what conditions. This is a must have book! This will be the best small investment that you have ever made, if you are truly serious about Bass fishing!"
3,I don't want rerecordings...,"Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits. It's good that they put ""Newly Recorded"" on the cover, so at least they don't mislead you. If you're like me, you want the original hit. There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed. Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording. LB"
2,Not ABC-Paramount originals,"With the exception of ""The Longest Day"", these are Paul's re-recordings of some of his 50's and early 60's ABC-Paramount material when he signed with RCA-Victor in 1962, moving away from his ""teen idol"" image. I was disappointed back in the 60's when I purchased the vinyl LP, thinking I was getting the originals. Rhino's ""30th Anniversary Collection"" covers the essential ABC-Paramount, RCA Victor, Buddah and UA hits. The Japanese 2-CD import ""ABC-Paramount Original Classics"" has an excellent selection from the early ""Big 15"" years, but I don't know if it is still in print."
2,all rerecorded!!,"This is the RCA period of ANKA. All his early ABC-Paramount hits are rerecorded, like Diane, Put Your Head on My Shoulder, etc."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I BORROWED THIS ALBUM FROM MY FRIEND WHEN WE MOVED TO KAUAI IN 1965 WHEN I WAS 15 AND I DROVE MY PARENTS CRAZY PLAYING IT AND FINALLY HAD TO RETURN IT TO MY FRIEND...WHEN I SAW IT WAS ON CD FORMAT I WAS VERY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE SAME SONGS AFTER ALMOST 40 YEARS. LET ME TELL YOU IT IS SO FAR FROM THE ORIGINAL ALBUM I WANT TO CRY. HE CANT EVEN MAKE SOME OF THE HIGH NOTES AND IF HE WERE ON AMERICAN IDOL WITH THE STYLE AND VOICE THAT IS ON THIS CD SIMON AND THE OTHERS WOULD GET HIM OFF PRONTO. SORRY, BUT DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DUD."
1,Why Would Anyone Do This?,"Re-makes of Paul Anka? Are they crazy? First of all, who would want to buy this KNOWING they're remakes when the original versions are available at much the same price? Unfortunately, I received mine through the mail and, until it arrived, I had no way of knowing the selections were ALL re-done years after the originals.For those fans lamenting the unavailability of some of his material, you might try seeking out Hello Young Lovers, first released in Europe in 1988 by CeDe International [CD 66063]. It has no liner notes, but it does contain 16 ORIGINAL hits, including I Miss You So [# 33 in 1959], (All Of A Sudden) My Heart Sings [# 15 in 1959], Adam And Eve [the flip of Puppy Love and a # 90 on its own], the title song [# 23 in 1960], as well as a bona fide ""lost"" Anka hit, Kissin' On The Phone [# 35 in 1961].This is a little gem IF you can find it."
2,"It Says ""NEWLY RECORDED"" On The Cover","There is nothing wrong with an artist re-recording his hits [John Prine did it recently] but this is not a great package. Mr. Anka could have written notes about the songs, as Elvis Costello and Randy Newman have done for re-issues of their songs.The ""booklet"" here is blank on the inside. How about a mini-pinup for the sweet old ladies?By the way, both Buddy Holly and Linda Ronstadt have done much better versions of Anka's ""It Doesn't Matter Anymore."""
2,21 FAKE HITS,I didn't believe my ears when I heard this CD. These are FAKE- REMAKE items. Who need this for heaven sake?
1,No Real Puppy Love,"Although it is true that some of these tracks made their way onto the air waves, as a former broadcaster, I always cringed when I had to play a cut off this album. Especially ""Diana"". We knew they weren't the originals and hoped the listeners wouldn't notice.I'm don't even like the term ""Newly Recorded"" because some may think that means ""remastered"". I'll grant you it is cool when a company takes the old master tapes that were originally recorded in stereo but released back then in mono, and lets us here them for the first time in stereo.Also, despite 21 songs, there are many hits missing such as ""All of the Sudden, My Heart Sings"", ""Having my Baby"", ""The Times of Your Life"", ""I Believe there's Nothing Stronger than Our Love"", on and on and on.I'd recommend buying a cd with the originals and then supplementing any other desired pieces with the Amazon music downloader."
5,Excellent Golden Oldies,This compilation of Paul Anka songs greatest hits is absolutley amazing. I enjoy listening to every single song on this album and singing along to them.
1,I still haven't received this item,"I adress to you because I send this item to a hotel in Miami where I spent 2 days on the date the delivery should have been made, but it didn't arrive on the 21st nor the 22nd. of January as you said. And still today it hasn't arrived so I wonder what have happened with my order.Will you please check that it has been sent to the proper adress.Thank you very much."
5,An Excellent Teacher,"Alright, I've haven't read the final book. I do have an unfinished version that Professor Sanford distributed when I took this class from him at the U of Maryland. The initial version was excellent. I had tried to slog through other presentations on fracture mechanics and had gotten lost in the details.Rather than just presenting the stress intensity factor and other concepts, he gave a good historical development of just where these quantities came from and why anyone would or should use them to predict time to failure."
2,Narrative to fit LDS view,"...This book is a period piece that describes the essentially fundamental Latter Day Saints view according to Joseph Smith as a more logical way to narrate the Christian metanarratives. Specifically, it avoids the Platonic paradoxes by moving away from the orthodox conception of the Creator God who creates ex nihilo or who creates man. Man instead is eternal as is God and God is subject to the demands of the universe. This book demonstrates a well read author, though one who missed the linguistic turn."
4,A Collection True to Its Title,"""Pure Gold"" is a perfect choice if you're looking to buy just one Elvis CD. This collection has a great mix of some of his most well known hits (""Jailhouse Rock"", ""Don't Be Cruel"", ""All Shook Up"", ""Love Me Tender"") combined with songs that hint at Elvis' other flavors, like ""Kentucky Rain"", which leans toward his Southern side, the mellow and jazzy ""Fever"", and the haunting ballad, ""In The Ghetto"".If you're looking for the ultimate collection of all of Elvis' big hits, though, this album might be a good start for you but will probably fall short."
4,Great Music For The Elvis Fan,I gave the album a 4 because of the horrible album cover. Did Elvis just walk off the set of Planet Of The Apes when this photo was snapped? I didn't know he guest starred on the show! Roddy McDowell would be proud with the look Elvis has got going on this album cover! The album is classic Elvis and is great (As long as you can keep your lunch down by not looking at the cover!)
2,Unbelievable repetition,"Calling this a 3-CD set is beyond a misnomer. Most of the tracks on the second and third CDs are repeats of tracks on the first CD. Only six tracks on CD2 are not on CD1, and only three tracks on CD3 are not on CD1. Most of the transfers are decent, though some are from vinyl and are not cleaned up (or not cleaned up well). The Mindbenders' superb ""My New Day and Age,"" for example, suffers from a few ticks and pops that easily could have been removed. There also is no licensing information, nor are there liner notes. It's not a bad collection at all for what it is, but keep in mind that spread across three CDs you are only getting 34 tracks, not 54, and the quality of some of the transfers is less than outstanding."
3,Cheap,"It works, its really small. Clamps dont stay tight. I'd buy a better one,next time. It works, was cheap, it will do."
3,Bicycle Mirror,In my opinion this mirror needs a lock nut on the stem. The mirror can become loose if you aren't riding on smooth ground.
5,"Sunlite round Mirror yellow reflector 3""",Nice Great! Matches My Old bike from the 60's My friends have asked me where did I get it with a yellow reflector. thanks
3,"Does not fit my bike, but looks like a nice mirror","Unfortunately, I bought this for a road bike and it did not fit. I guess I should have known this....I wasn't overly surprised. Even though it would not work with my bike, it does look like a decent mirror. The size is good, and the image in the mirror is quite clear. In addition, it is very sturdy. The bracket is easy to adjust to the handlebars. I would have given it 4 stars (5 minus the 1 because it didn't fit), but it isn't that long as previous reviews have mentioned, and I am skeptical to how well visibility would be even if it had of fit."
1,Not safe,"This is not a convex mirror and it must be positioned under the handlebars to not be obstructed by the arm. The handlebars must be turned to sweep and get a full rear view which is difficult to do at times. The mirror also, even when tightened considerably, still loosens with road bumps. It is also difficult to adjust because the axis's of movement are oblique.I consider using this mirror more dangerous than safe. While I have my eyes on the mirror searching for dangers behind I find myself missing what is going on in front.I now orderedCateye BM-300G Road Mirrorand hope it will be a better choice. I wish I had ordered it first but still wonder if the same criticisms of this mirror apply. Look for my review there in a week!"
3,It Gets the Job Done But Not Perfect,"I like this mirror but it's too short for my mountain bike. When I installed it rightside up, I realized that the neck was too short so I can't see anything but my own body when I look into the mirror. Only when I installed it upside down that it worked. The mirror doesn't have any instructions but it's too simple not to get the installation right."
4,Nice mirror for the price,"This is a nice little mirror for what I paid for it. The finish is nice and the hardware, though not heavy-duty is adequate. As I ride along, I have to move the mirror stalk a bit with my thumb from time to time since it is difficult to lock the mirror in place without stressing the clip, but I find this no bother. I'm happy with my purchase."
4,Bike Mirrors,"Good price. The mirrors arrived quickly. They mounted nicely. The mirrors do need to have some type of rubber backing, where they attach to the handlebar, so that they stay in place."
3,so-so,"When attached to the handlebar of my bike, I could only see my left arm because it doesn't extend out very far. I had to attach to the grip. The clamp isn't big enough to fit the diameter of my grips, so it had to be stretched open with pliers. Getting the bolt throught the stretched clamp wasn't easy but it worked. It does need frequent adjustments, but otherwise it's so-so. You're getting what you pay for."
3,Too Cheap,"It met the goal of getting the bike past inspection, but the vibrations caused the nuts to loosen rather quickly and it doesn't have the length to provide a good rearward view. Needs to be a little more substantial for everyday use."
3,Nuts Stripped Too Easily,"The mirror and mounting seem like a fine product, but the nuts that came with mine fit somewhat loose on the threads of the mirror and got stripped very easily. I will be getting some different nuts that fit better and trying that..."
3,"good quality mirror, but too small.","I like the looks of the mirror, and the quality seems good to me. However, the glass is flat - and with only 3"" diameter, you just can't see very much of what is going on behind you without looking around at the mirror. A larger version of this mirror may work better. I've replaced it with a Ortlieb Ultralite Bike Mirror from Adventure Cycling."
4,It's what I ordered and hoped for,"This is not very exciting, just a basic mirror; but I couldn't find one in nearby stores and this worked out to be convenient and inexpensive. Glad I found it."
3,Reear view.,Getting the job done although a bit small. Could have used a bit larger mirror. Works as intended. Easy to install.
1,Poor design,"I took a chance on this because I needed a mirror. This product does not stay in one place, as the joints loosen during every ride. It also does not give a good field of view. I think it would work better, if mounted on the far side of the grips, but I couldn't do that with my bike. After my experience with this product and talking to other bikers, I have switched to a helmet based mirror. (Bike Peddler Take A Look Cycling Eyeglass Mirror - works better)"
5,Great Mirrors,I order these mirrors for my wife trike/bicycle ad they look great on it.Easy to put on and adjust.I like these so much I may order my self a pair of them for my trike that I am building here.
4,good value,recently purchased a set of these mirrors as a gift for a friend and are a good buy for the price. Nice and sturdy.
4,Good mirror,It helps you to see the cars that are coming up behind you therefore adds a bit of safety which is of great importance to me since I have a 5.4 mile daily round trip commute. Having the little reflector is also added safety.
1,loosened after one short bike ride,"It took quite a while to get the mirror mounted and just the right angle to see cars coming behind me. It was wonderful for one bike ride. The next time I got on my bike it was no longer in the correct position to see and when I tried to adjust it, it swung down and dangled from the handlebars. Too much work for far too little use."
1,I can't see!,I have been looking for the right bicycle mirror so I can see traffic behind me. I almost fell several times trying to adjust the mirror right. But I can adjust it to see me so that's kinda cool. (joke)
3,Organizer,"It is a nice organizer, I would like a different option for the address portion of it - it is a bit confusing."
5,I'LL KISS MY ... BEFORE I THINK OF YOU,"Just like a delicious POP tune from the 80's this record is one of the finest songs out there, the Sugababes deliver such a great message of ""get over a relationship"", the easy to follow music should get to the top of your brains, just like ""Scandalous"" of Misteeq, this tunes are the best dance-pop gems out there in these days, imported from the UK, America should take an example an embrace more clever pop, and give space on the radio waves, there's just too much hip-rap-drop out there, we need more clever tunes, than just rap, and the Sugabes ""Hole In The Head"" are a sure bet."
1,Not worth it ...,"Like the other lady said, I to had the set rust after a couple of weeks. Also, most of the knives are dull and wouldn't even cut bread. It's been a couple of years and I wouldn't waste my money! If I knew how to get my money back, I would in a heart beat!"
4,Like wearing nothing at all,"I started wearing thongs when my wife told me if I liked them so much I can wear them. I bought some as a joke and damn if I didn't find them to be quite comfortable, now I wear the thongs in the family. She will not be converted, much to my chagrin. This one I found very comfortable until I dried it too hot and shrunk it. Either get the larger size or don't shrink it."
4,its nice,but even a size samll is a little too big from the mid-part but the design is nice and comfortabel as well
3,"Nice underwear, but small pouch","I like the look and feel of these but the pouch is unfortunately just too small. Even ordering the next size up, the band fits loosely, and the pouch still too tight."
1,Mindless Ranting,"This book is written in the same style that Jerry Knox rants on message boards accross the nation. His book reads just like his website, all the content filling up your screen contained on one page that scrolls and scrolls forever. He may have some information that is correct, but his contradictions and mindless chatter make reading this book, a chore."
5,"Beautiful, elegant and a good value","These really look as though they cost a lost more than they do. I get compliments every time I wear them. They are so nice, I bought a pair for my sister. They make a terrific gift."
3,"Good lessions, but in a different key (A D F# B instead of G C E A)","The lessons are simple and progress at a good pace. However, the instructor tunes his ukulele A D F# B instead of the more common G C E A. If you plan to use any other books (or play with other ukulele players), this could be confusing. I liked Heeday'sHow to Pick & Strum the Ukulele, Volume 1better."
1,I accidentally bought this book at the music store without looking it up here first,"so I had to return it, and then ordered the other version (same book, but with ""C"" tuning). This is a very easy method book for people who want to simply strum along and learning a few easy chords at a time and singing old folk-type songs. BUT! as the others have said, this is written for a ukulele set-up in non-standard tuning. My ukulele (also bought from amazon; you can read my review) is a tenor-sized Lanikai, and it came with the usual ""C"" tuning found also on soprano- and concert-sized ukes. SO be sure to buy the ""right"" book--it says ""C TUNING EDITION"" in small print on the upper right corner."
1,I don't like it,I can't recommenf this book. It only introduces very common fish. It tells very little about the fishes and the pictures are bad too because they are not photographs but drawings. This book doesn't even look good in bookself because it's so small.
3,Hate to stick out but...,"...after 2 weeks of listening and doing a 100HR burn-in they are disappointing me. Don't get me wrong, if you listen to acoustic guitars and other acoustic instruments you'll probably really love these.But beware if you listen to music with lots of sound-mass. I.E. Rock and Metal these headphones are very bass heavy and distort easily and are actually very low in output volume, but hey not everyone enjoys loud music.Anyways 3 stars for intense music and 5 for softer stuff. I've returned mine and I think that (believe it or not) the ear buds that came with my new Nano (2ND GEN) sound a lot better.So the hunt is still on for the ultimate headphones that are ""street-Sized""I have had some of the most expensive ""consumer"" in-ear headphones out there (SHURE f.ex) and still I'm disappointed, maybe my demands are to high."
4,Love the PX100 headphones,I'm not an audiophile and needed headphones for work and home use. The PX100 provide a rich sound and are very wearable over several hours. I personally find the hard plastic carrying case very user friendly. To much time spent folding and adjusting to try and fit in. Rarely can get it to close and have since abandoned the case and have dedicated a pocket in my laptop bag.
4,Nice for Price,"Very nice, pretty portable, sound very good, nifty steam-punk design. And inexpensive. What's not to like? Ok, one channel went out on my former pair because of a broken wire in the cord at the plug. These new ones I jerry-rigged a protection. Hope it works, because even though they are not expensive, to buy them over and over every year could be a Toyota level disappointment."
3,"good,,but not good enough","the bass sounds perfect and make me surprised..but the treble is not as good as the bass,,may be it will improve after it have enough time to warm up,,i only bought this the day before yesterday..and the headset is not very comfortable,,especially for someone who has the big head like me,,my ears get tired after listen music for two hours..u can guess the headset is not ""long"" enough to cover my both ears.."
4,Great for Non-Ear-budders (like me),"These phones sound great! They deliver a natural sounding bass and are not ""tinny"" at all. They are extremely portable and, best of all, don't have to be shoved into my ear canal."
5,headphone with good price/performance ratio,"It is among the products with the best quality at its price. Although the bass is not so clear, it is good enough for pop musics."
4,Great sound for traveling,"I could never get used to ear buds and was looking for a nice set of head phones that traveled light. These are it -great sound in a light weight package that folds neatly in its own carrying case. No loose wires to get tangled in your other gear. Folding takes a little practice, but this is the best alternative to ear buds I have found.One warning - these do not block ambient noise, so don't buy if you plan on using for plane trips."
4,comfortable and fine audio,this is my second pair. the fidelity is excellent and they are extremely comfortable. the wire is a bit too long. would recommend as an alternative to ear buds.
5,Fantastic Sound (Especially the Bass),"If you have an iPod and are not happy with the sound of your current headphones, then try these. The one thing no one explains to you, when you buy headphones, is that you need to match the impedance of the headphones you're buying, to the output impedance of the iPod. Most iPods have an output impedance of 32 ohms. And yet the majority of headphones sold have an impedance of 16 ohms. That mismatch affects the sound quality, especially the bass. I have an iPod Nano and I bought these Sennheiser headphones specifically because they have a 32 ohm impedance. I couldn't be more pleased with the incredible bass response. Fantastic sound !!"
3,"Great sound, terrible cable and connector quality","I really like these headphones. The sound quality is very good; they're lightweight and fold nicely; they're comfortable.But I've had four of them and they all got intermittent connections at the plug. Two were my fault (cat chewed through cord, other snagged and yanked on). However, I've never had any other headphones with such a cheap cable and plug connection. On one of them, I tried to solder on a new connector. The wire inside the cable is magnet wire (very very very thin with enamel insulation). A little friction and the enamel wouldn't come off. A little more friction and the enamel still didn't come off but the wire snapped.I finally gave up and now wear koss and grado."
1,Avoid,"Great sound for the price, but defective wiring will cause them to be garbage within about six months."
2,Great for people with limited hearing,"I expected different considering the consistent praises they get.These headphones lack an authentic high end, like so many modern headphones, though worse than most. Not the best for tunes.Also, an iPod is quite capable of blowing these things. Mine were blown while listening to a poorly recorded conference - and just three weeks old.I still keep them around, just because I haven't thrown them away yet."
1,Great sound but break easily,I bought these and used them for one week before the plug snapped off in my ipod (with very little pressure applied). While I was using them they had great sound and folded up nicely into the case.
3,"Poor bass, uncomfortable after an hour or so","I've had these headphones for about a week and a half, long enough to give a fair judgement. I've used them for at least four hours daily during that time.These headphones do not handle bass well at all. Anything bass-heavy (such as Nirvana's Nevermind) sounds distorted, regardless of the volume. The higher frequencies are acceptable, but with much classical music the higher frequencies sound ""muddy"".Note that I'm comparing these to my old Sennheiser HD-580s (purchased for ~$200 ten years ago), but the difference is very noticeable. I don't think you have to be an audiophile to notice (and be bothered by) the difference.Regarding comfort, they feel fine for the first hour or so, but eventually my ear cartilage starts to feel sore. After about two hours I have to take them off for a while.The Y-shaped cord is about four feet long, which I find sufficient. However, I prefer an L-shaped plug."
2,You get what you pay for,"I'm not an audiophile, but I do like a full, rich sound when listening to music, whether through headphones or with speakers. I bought these headphones as a spare pair after reading the rave reviews that said the sound is incredible for the price.I think it's safe to say the sound is about what I would expect for a $30 pair of headphones.Maybe I'm spoiled by my Ultimate Ears set of ear buds, but the sound out of the Sennheiser headphones seemed tinny and weak, and the bass was very mild. I guess the headphones will be OK as a spare set for emergencies, but if you want full, rich music I suggest you break down and pay for quality headphones like Bose, Shure, or Ultimate Ears."
5,Amazing value,"I saw many good comments about these headphones and decided for the price I couldn't afford not to try them. They have become my favorite iPod headphones, I can't believe the quality of the music you get for the price. I'm not an audiophile, but there's no question these are the best I have. I actually prefer the sound of these to my Bose QuietComfort 2's, although admittedly those emphasize noise-cancelling and have great sound too. I'll echo previous reviewer's comments that the included case is more of a traveling case than a routine storage case as it is not easy to get them back into it.I use these primarily for exercise-related uses and have not owned them long enough yet to see what the long term effects of sweat and hard use are."
4,Good value and quality,"I'm very picky when it comes to audio, an the PX100 is a solid pick when it comes to detailed, nicely rendered sound at a reasonable price. It comes with an ingenious plastic storage mechanism, and offers the kind of clear sound you expect from Sennheiser.It's an ""open"" headphone, so listening in enclosed places like libraries, coffee shops or your bedroom might prove annoying to others. I've found that fully-fleshed out stereo alleviates these faults considerbly, and reduces the need for added volume. There is no way to ""mod"" these into a more private headphone, however.These are so popular for one major reason: they have an extremely pleasing balance that has detailed highs with a solid (but not overdone) bass. Moreover, they fold up into a very small package that you can carry along with your player without any fear of damage. Although mostly plastic, they seem to have a solid build and a good potential to last. This is one of your major picks for an open portable."
4,great headphones!,"Okay, so these headphones are everything they claim to be. They're lightweight, while being heavy on sound. When I was ready to travel w/them, it took a while to collapse. But after following the diagram on the case, I was fine. They are so great, that I rarely listen to my iPod w/the other headphones, unless I don't have these on me. Anyway, the only thing that concerns me is what people say about the connector. I've had them for two months with no problem. Another reviewer suggests that you cover the connector w/heat shrink tubing or tape, when you first get it. I haven't done this yet. But if they were to go out, I'd do it when I got the replacement. For the price, you can't beat these headphones. They don't look all bulky while on your head."
4,Good but unsure about the cord,"I like the design, and the sound quality seems excellent. However, I'm concerned about the very thin cord/wires wearing out from the daily pack and unpack. I'd expect a little more reinforcement where the cord exits the actual headphone - not that there's nothing. There is a little bit of rubber around the wire right where it exits. My old headphones had a little shock absorber thingy there to lessen the strain. It's just that to pack these into the case (which is a great feature for me so that I can suff it into my laptop case every day) the wire has to be bent at about 90 degrees. However, when you wear them the wires are straightened out. Everyday a straighten and a bend. This is because to pack it right, you need to cinch up a little grommet thing that slides along both wires. Time will tell on this, and I'll report back if/when they break. Othewise, I'm glad I purchased them."
4,Good with this price,"If you like a lot of bass and don't want to spend much, go for this phone. For this phone, you couldn't get as amazing sound as Bose QC3. But it is better than Bose QC3 someway, it doesn't drop from my head even when I jog on treadmill. I never fold it back so I couldn't say a word for it. And it is very light. The cord is not bad based on the price we paid. Overall, I am happy with this phone."
3,"I really do love them, but...","I've purchased two sets of these headphones, and was really a fan each time for about 6 months. I consider myself a moderate audiophile with shallow pockets, and these were really my choice. The bass levels were great, and you can really make out instrumentation that was otherwise missing from cheaper headphones. Great replacements for the iPod earbuds.The problem is that after about 6 months each time I would get a short in the right channel. I managed to squeeze another day or two out of them with shakey connection before they were gone for good. Admittedly, I'm a bit rough with my things, but for $50 I'd expect a pair of headphones to last longer than 6 months.Bottom line - if you can treat these guys gingerly, they're likely to be a good buy. But if you plan on just tossing them into your bag, or occasionally catch wires, this may not be the set for you."
5,Definite good buy,"I love these headphones. They have a great sound as I use them with my Apple Ipod. They're convenient to use and they fold up and slip in your jacket pocket. Sears carries them but I found them cheaper on Amazon. Bass, treble and midrange, they're all there. I have been using them almost a year now and they are still holding up very well. I purchased two pair because I knew they were going to get popular and the company would raise the price.. and guess what? Sennheiser produce good products."
5,Fantastic,"I was expecting these headphones to deliver after reading all the positive reviews and wow...all I can say is these are fantastic. Sound super crisp, base is nice and solid and they definitely beat my over the ear phones which cost 3 times as much by a wide margin. They are comfortable as well and for the price this is a ""must buy"". Oh, it also comes with a pretty nice case to keep them in good shape while traveling."
5,All I can say is 'WOW',"I bought these headphones based of the recommendations of the 'AnythingButIPOD' web site. These deliver a crisp, full, natural sound. It's a pleasure to use these."
4,Very good value,"Found this thru Consumer Reports, rated a best buy, so I bought it as a gift and they are very pleased, folds up compactly, light and easy on the ears. Very good sound, but not great."
4,Very good headphones,The quality is indeed very good. But it is not that comfortable to wear. I have to take it off after about 40 minutes. Maybe i have a bigger head :-(
5,Best portable headphones for less than $50.,"I have owned quite a few headphones over the years and few have ever combined excellent sound with good portability. You just cannot beat the sound for the price. I have a set of PortaPros also and found those to have more, but looser(flabby)bass. The larger, heavy hitters from Sennheiser and Grado will give you better performance and last longer but for a serious premium. If you are willing to spend $130, then the Etymotics ER-6 should be your portable headphone choice."
3,Ear cushions fall off all the time,"PROS:The sound quality is very good for the price.They collapse easily, I have it down to about 20 secs.CONS:The ear cushions fall off all the time. I finally lost one.Bottom line: If they included a couple of extra ear cushions (that would cost them $.10 extra) I would give this a four star rating."
4,better than buds,"I got these because I hate earbuds. They aren't as good as the big earmuffs I have had in the past, but for something compact, they put out good sound for the price."
3,"cheap design, but still good for price","I was enticed by the high reviews and low price, plus the sound quality is awesome for the price. If you plan on using these headphones more so than casually though they are likely to break. It is cheaply made, particularly the chord design. It's difficult to solder those thin fiber threads to a new jack as well. Recommend something else for heavy use. I used them occasionally for about a year till they stopped working, have had cheaper phones last longer."
4,collapsible ear phones,"Good that they fold to become compact. A nice item, still a little bulky, but decent."
5,Excellent travel companion,"I cannot use ear buds of any type and needed a compact headphone that would fit in my fanny pack. Searched the Inet and found just the right product at the right price with an acceptable shipping and delivery date to support a flight to Cabo San Lucas. Used in conjunction with a Sansa Clip MP3 player loaded with audible books. Great companion, comfortable and not too obtrusive"
5,These things are great,"These phones are the best portable headphones on the market and I've tried more than 30 kinds. The bass is unbelievable for on-the-ear units and the treble is crisp, clear and extended. They're very well-made (unlike ALL Sony phones), incredibly sturdy and come with a case that is built like a tank. German engineering at its best. You will not have buyer's remorse over this purchase."
5,Amazing quality for the price,"I am very satisfied with my purchase of these headphones. Sound quality is amazing. In addition, the earpieces fit snugly against your ear so you get the full bass sound. (My pet peeve with other headsets is you have to wear a headband to keep them close against your ear.)This is the best brand of headest I've found and the low price just mnakes it better."
3,Wow!,"I am a long time Sennheiser owner so I had some idea what to expect, but I have been pleaseantly surprised with their quality. These are as great as headphones this size get. They sound great out of the box, and even better after regular use. I am pleased with these headphones for many reasons, all of which have been said already. First, they are very comfortable. The earpieces themselves have a ball and socket type action that comfortably flexes over the ears. There is also padding on the top where the band goes over the head. The two wires going to the cans can be tightened closer to the chin to keep them secured. I am so pleased with them that I have actually bought another pair. All I can say is ""wow!""My main concern is that I wonder how long they'll last. They seem a little flimsy. And they let a lot of sound in, so it can be hard to hear the music if it is noisy around you."
2,like the fold-up----don' t like the sound,"I only bought these because of other reviews that seemed favorable, but they're nothing great as for sound.It's cool the way they fold up for travelling, but they don't block any of the surrounding noise, so what you end uo hearing is not that good."
2,A waste of money,"These headphones may be a step up from the headphones that came with your portable. Maybe.But that's about it.People who are impressed with these headphones probably have never heard good headphones, or good speakers, for that matter.If you know what good sound is, these are a waste of money.Note that the specs do not list a +/- db for the frequency response. These headphones have very little bass or high frequency response. But what they do reproduce is fairly clear, though there is some coloration.And the headphones are comfortable.So they would make excellent headphones for a foreign language lab, which is where you most often see Sennheisers.Listen to these headphones before you buy them. And compare them with some good headphones.THEY ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.I should have returned them.I do not use them because the sound is so unpleasant.I am not exaggerating."
1,very disappointed,"After waiting for a week for this product it arrived from J&R Music World broken. The right earpiece did not work. I contacted J&R and they will take it back, but it is going to take another week to get to the store, then they will ship a replacement at normal shipping times. I asked if they would expediate the shipping but the company refused. I am now looking at a minimum of three weeks after ordering (probably closer to four) before I receive another set. I may try and order these again (lots of positive reviews) but I will try from a different vendor."
3,white version is better than the black,"I just received px-100 from Amazon to replace my old white px100, which was broken lately. After 20 hours continuous ""burn-in"" with professional burn-in cd, I'm disappointed with this black version.Compare to my old white px100, the black version seems to be lacking transparency, the music sounded muffled, many details lost. It does have better(stronger) bass, but that doesn't justify the loss of clarity and transparency. If you are going to buy px100, I would highly recommend the white version, it's only $1.00 more in Amazon."
3,Cheap construction,"Bought these love them, they are comfortable and sound great. If you like bass (and I don't) then these are not the headphones for you. If you like to toss your equipment in and out of a gym bag, then these are not for you either. Mine broke in the first 2 months, I had to use a glue gun to repair them. The gob of clear glue on my left ear makes me look nerdy, but they work.Bottomline- Great headphones, horrible construction, cheaply desigend plastic parts."
3,Overpriced?,"Nice sound, but for me the audio quality is indistinguishable from my $10 Philips (SBCHS500) behind-the-neck headphones. Although several reviewers commented favorably on the comfort of the PX100's, I found the opposite to be true (I wonder if my head is too large or oddly shaped). In any event, I'm afraid these Sennheiser headphones will mostly just gather dust since I plan on using my indestructible (and far more comfortable) Philips headphones until my ears fall off."
3,Ok for the $,Sound quality is just Ok for size. Case and ability to fit the set into same is a bit difficult at first. Basic and what I wanted. Light weight and easily packed. Got what I paid for.
4,Great sound,"These headphones are about as good as you'll find for the price. Excellent sound for headphones under $100. Also very portable. I've owned a pair for 6 years of pretty heavy use, and they still work like new."
5,Satisfied,"Before I bought these, I was having a really tough time deciding between them and the px200 headphones that provide more insulation. I ended up picking px100 because they were slightly cheaper, and the reviews said the sound was better. I'm glad I did because although anyone near me can hear what I'm listening to even if it's at normal levels, there aren't many situations where this is a problem.I listen to music ALL the time, so I will have to be more careful with these headphones. So far I haven't been coordinated or patient enough to fold them each time I put them in my purse or something. I do wish the jack was l-shaped instead of straight, because the thinner cord seems prone to weakening and possibly breaking if I have these for a while. Other than that, I love that these headphones provide great sound while they are so lightweight you can use them anywhere and forget you're wearing them."
4,A quality product,"As headphones go, these are well worth the money. Folding them is a bit tricky but it is convient. The sound is good, and they are comfortable to wear. I use them with my Kindle 2."
4,Sennheiser PX 100 Collapsible Headphones,"These headphones are convenient to use, comfortable on ears, and deliver melodious sound without much of hiss. However, the utility of the set will greatly improve if it includes a volume adjuster -- so one does not have to go back and forth to iPod to adjust volumne."
4,Crystal Clear Sound!,"I bought these headphones last week for my iPod, for under $40 this headphones have very good sound reproduction. Even with songs encoded in MP3 format you'll be able to distinguish between all the instruments. Sleek design, sits comfortably on your head. Only hitch is it is open-air, so people sitting around you might notice the sound at high volume."
4,Nice package for money; good not great sound,"This is a ""buy"" because of the price, the portability, and the more than adequate sound. IMO, there is a certain ""fullness"" lacking in the overall music presentation, and I would not get carried away by some of the more glowing reviews. But I suspect one has to step up to another $$$ level for a noticeable improvement. The manner in which the phones fold and the ""sunglasses""-type case are major pluses."
5,Quality Sound at an Affordable Price,"Let me start by saying Congratulations! You've found the best pair of headphones for the iPod! I should stress that ""iPod"" bit, though, because there are better phones out there - it's just that none of them will work with a portable player without an external amp.The sound quality is amazing on these things is amazing, considering the price - it makes the earbuds that come with the iPod sound like the tin cans they are. As far as portability goes, they fold up into their own case - a very useful function; and when it comes to comfort, they can be worn comfortably for hours on end. And that's coming from a guy with glasses and a big head! To top it all off, they're surprisingly durable. I've had my pair for two and a half years, and they are only now starting to show their age.For the price, you simply can't go wrong with these headphones."
5,I enjoy these headphones,"These headphones are better than many of the sony and other brands I have tried in the past. They don't pickup as much interferences in my day to day activities such as cell phone, radio, and tv interference."
3,Good headphone,"They sounded a little flat when I first tried them. Then I lost my earbud phones from my pioneer xm radio and used these exclusively. They sound good to me now. Obviously, you get no outside noise protection from these light, comfortable and very portable phones."
4,Does the trick.,"Pros: Good sound, pretty easily collapses into a small size for easy carrying to and from the gym, comfortable, long enough cord for jogging, comes with carrying case.Cons: gets wet from sweat if you work out (but dries out and is not a big deal), feels like it might not last forever (but who knows? not a con yet), people around you can hear your music so might not be good at libraries for rock 'n rollerz.The only reason I gave this product a 4 and not a 5 is because I hear so much great stuff about noise cancellation technology and figure there has to be better stuff out there, but I wasn't ready to cough up the extra money."
5,Good Headphone.,This is a very good headphone set for my Thinkpad T61.I like the way it can be folded into to its case.It's easy to carry around and has good sound quality.
4,Nice item for the price,These headphones did not disappoint. Very light and great sounding. They stay on your head and did I say they sound great? The only issues I have with them is the straight plug and they let a lot of abient noise in. For the price though they are a good value. Not bad if you are using them in the house or a gym where there isn't a lot of noise.
2,Disappointed !,Sound quality is not that great!I don't understand why so many people left good reviews for this product.Sound is just okay at the most.Distorsion on the bass is just awful!Maybe I've got a bad batch..... anyways it's not worth the money.This product should be around $20 Not $40.
2,Good in the beguining,"First of all, FWIW, I listen to classical music, especially to opera.I had an awesome Sennheiser HD433. Unfortunately they don't make this model anymore. I went to a store that carries Sennheisers and tried one headphone after another to check which one comes close to the HD433. The salesperson was also impressed by the quality of HD433 (I brought with me to compare) and agreed to no headphone came closer, even the most expensive ones. This PX100 sounded the best of them and I bought a pair of those. In the first couple of days I was impressed, then, all of the sudden the sound quality started to deteriorate. The bass started to be too powerful, the treble was gone and the midrange with no significant presence. I am very disappointed with this headphone and I am willing to resume my hunt for another headphone that gives me the pleasure that the HD433 did."
3,Great sound but the speaker covering falls off,The foam covers for the ears fall off. I've tried glue and needle and thread. So annoying!
3,Too expensive,"This was a bad deal that I wanted to return. The headphones are nicely design in shape,the way you fold it. However, the comfort is low, and the quality is not the best. It works, but its not worth the price. If you try hard enough(not too hard) you can find much better headphones for a much better price."
4,Great sound with my IPOD,"Very nice frequency response, clear highs, decent bass. The only drawback I found was some discomfort on my ears after wearing them for over an hour; a little pressure. No padding to speak of. Overall great sound."
5,Amazing headphones for a great price!,"this is an amazing headphone for under $40. Its very convenient to carry around in the case provided, and sounds just great! Also, its very light, so you can wear it for long hours without having to sweat or feel uncomfortable. Sound is just awesome.Drawbacks:Doesnt have a volume control on the headphone."
3,Not as good as I expected,The reviews for the PX100 were overwhelmingly positive - here and all around the net. But I am sorely dissapointed. The high frequencies are so muted and bland I have to set the equalization on my ipod to treble boost to make it listenable. I am still baffled that so many people think they are great. The bass I'll admit is pretty good. But for most Jazz and acoustical music including vocals the sound is so dull.I have a Grado SR-60 that is so much better with uniformly good sound across the frequency range. I was looking for something smaller and portable that sounded better than the stock ear buds that the ipod comes with. At this point I prefer listening to the ipod buds for a lot of the music despite its non-existent low frequency.
4,Good outside ear phones for MP3 players.,"Not as clear (or expensive)as ear buds and don't block out outside sound like around the ear phones, but a good choice for listening to your MP3 tunes. Good base, comfortable. The fold up nature isn't important to me, burt may be a convience to travelers."
4,Nice Headphones!,"I have been listening to music with these headphones for several months and have had no problems with them. The quality for sound and workmanship are both good. They also come with a nice carrying case to keep them in for protection (the headphone folding process is printed on the case and is a little tricky at first, but easily mastered).Sound quality is really good for headphones in this price range."
5,great sound and nice folding feature and case,My 18 year old goddaughter asked for new headphones for an MP3 player and to use with her laptop. She specified she didn't want ear buds. I use the Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones when I fly and I'm extremely satisfied so I thought I'd order the Sennheiser PX100 folding set for her. She loves them and is very satisified with the sound. She likes that they fold up and come with their own case. They were a huge hit as a Christmas gift
4,very good for the price,"The sound quality is very good & I had no problems with the cord. I like the hard case, but it does take a minute or 2 to get them put away in it. The worst I have to say is that like with almost all headphones the foam surrounding them is going to crumble & fall away after a few years. If not for this I'd give them 5 stars.Update: I bought a package of several foam covers on ebay that worked & fit perfectly."
5,Unbelievable sound at this price,"These headphones were highly rated just about everywhere I went and they weren't wrong. These are great sounding headphones, especially at the price point Amazon sells them at. The are very comfortable. These are not closed phones - you will hear the outside world around you depending upon how loud you play your music and the type of music you listen to. Also, the outside world will hear your music if you've got it cranked up so if you need/want isolation these might not be for you. But if you're looking for a great sounding set of inexpensive, open-air, on-ear type headphones, these can't be beat. Highly recommended."
5,Great pair of headphones!,"I absolutely LOVE these headphones! I am a daily iPod user...both for workouts and at the office to tune out all of the noise of cube-land... I received a pair of BOSE in-ear headphones for Christmas, but lately just don't like things IN my ears for too long... I wanted a pair of BOSE on-ear headphones, but really couldn't afford them... I started reading the reviews and thought I would try these... the sound (compared to my BOSE in-ear) is incredible...SOOOO much better than the BOSE... I can't speak for the BOSE on-ear, but these are SO much better than the BOSE in-ear ones I have...Without any break-in time, I have been listening to my iPod constantly...I can hear separations in my favorite songs that I could never discern before. I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone!"
4,Pure satisfaction!,"I have had this headphone for about a six months now- it is sounding as clear and crisp as the first day.If you are looking for versatility, this is the headphone you want- one slight problem, though, the ear-piece can soak up sweat, so buy a cheaper pair for work out sessions.Other than that, this headphone is a beast! The BASS is AMAZING- I was blown away when I first heard it, and am still getting blown away :)The treble output is a little low, but only if you are meticulous about the sound quality. I can hear every single instrument (including vocal harmonics), in a full orchestra as clear as bell- this thing is worth every penny!"
5,Great overall headphones,These headphones provide great quality for the price and the size. They are also foldable which is a an added bonus. You can blast the headphones and there is no static whatsoever. One of my greatest purchases.
3,"OK, not great","I bought this after seeing good reviews here. I bought a PXC 150 noise cancellation headphone earlier, so I compared this with teh PX 100. the PX 100 has a bit more base, but the highs and mid is not as good as the PXC 150, the sound on the PX 100 is more muddy than crisp compare to the PXC 150. You can definitely hear more background noise with the PX 100, and the sound quality is not as good as the PXC 150, and the extra base cannot make up for it. It sounds a bit cheap to be honest. Not very impressed."
4,Nice headphones,Bought these for my 15 year old nephew for the holidays for his ipod...So far so good
4,Sennheiser px 100 headphones,Great headphones for a inexpensive price. Not good noise isolation if you are in a noisy place.
5,Upgrade your iPod,"This is a wonderful set to use in place of the tiny, horrible earphones that come with so many products, including the iPod. Not audiophile quality, but very good.Update on 9-17-2007: I have had this set for over a year now, being used all day at work, and it is still flawless, comfortable and solid. A Sony headphone set I have at home has come apart already, even though I only use it part time here and there."
5,Best I have tried,I have tried many and have about 15 ear buds and over the ear and on the ear type headphones at a wide range of prices.These are the best headphones I have tried. hey are easy on the ears and have plenty of non-boomy bass. The sound is excellentMy grandson has sensitive to the touch ears and he even likes these. I bought another pair for him. He is very pleased.I like to walk and these are the best walking type too except for my one pair of earbuds. The others all made my ears sweat and felt uncomfortable. These are quite useable.I am very pleased and would buy another pair .
3,Sennheiser PX 100 - Good not Great,"PX 100 is a good product but I didn't find it so great as I expected it to be from the reviews I read. The delivery was OK, got it in about 10 days on free shipping.Pros of PX 100:* Easy to handle - Easy to transport* Good audio output* Ample cord length* LightWeight [maybe overlight leading it into cons]Cons:* Not real tight grip when fit over the head* Not recommended for gym, as the sweat gets to the sponge cover (some closed headphones have leather cushion which drips the sweat out)* It takes time to fold back into the case, though it makes it portable."
4,Works as advertised,"However getting it back into the case following use is difficult because of the small case size. I use it when on the ""trail"" but would advise something more durable for use at home."
4,I am the GOD of sound!!!,"I own 15 recording studios, produced four Beatles albums, and Rick Rubins calls me for advice, blah, blah, blah . . . But really I'm just a normal music lover and these headphones sound really good for the price."
5,Sennheiser PX 100,"Well I had bought these phones after a bit of online research and was more than pleased. They are very durable as how often at the gym did I accidently catch the wire on something but never a problem outside of ripping them off my head!I treat these phones very casually, tossing them in my back pack or gym bag.But they always sound great...comfortable for the gym and I love the bass response!Well 4 years and 3 sets of foam ear cushions later they finally got munched. So I doubled checked to see what the current on ear portable headphones favorites were this year..they were still a fav so I bought these replacements asap... Still as happy as ever!So if in ear portable headphones are not your thing then you can't go wrong with these!"
5,These are freaks!,"There is no way a pair of lightweight, fold-up headphones should sound like this! These things overachieve in a big way. I've only had them 1 day and they could fall apart tomorrow and I'd still give them 5 stars for the way they sound.Rich, tight bass.Sweet mids and high end.Comfortable fit.Handy carry case.Quality components.The only thing I'd change is the plug. I'd prefer an angled plug instead of straight. But that's a preference and not a fault.Seriously, these are killer portable headphones and unless you need the $40 for food, buy these."
1,"Great headphones, bad cord.","I loved these headphones. Great quality sound, very comfortable, lightweight and compact. Only one very big problem. The cord is very fragile where it meets the plug. Why did they make it straight instead of a 90-degree bend?I've had them only a year under normal use and the cord broke (right) at the plug. This renders these headphones useless. It is so stupid, even cheap Sonys have a 90-degree bend on the plug to avoid breaking the cord.Because of this problem, I would not recommend these headphones. I will be looking at another brand to replace them. It is unfortunate, because they are perfect in all other aspects."
2,Sound great but the connector is broken in a few months,"The headphones sounds great, the best I ever had. In one year the connector is broken and it's not fixable. Too expensive for only one year."
5,PX100's Excellent bang for the buck.,I write computer hardware reviews for devhardware.com and I had the pleasure of writing up a full review on these headphones which can be found at http://www.devhardware.com/c/a/Speakers/Sennheiser-PX100/needless to say they are definitely worth the money. For less than $40 you will not find a better sounding set of phones.
1,Chord wires coming loose,"As the other reviewers have mentioned - yes, the chord is terrible. In less than a year the wires are coming apart and ready to break at the mini plug. Decent sound quality is no use if the headphones become useless in a few months. Hope the manufacturer takes note of this very common complaint."
1,"Great sound, but fragile.","I've gone through 2 sets of these. The weak point is the plug. It does not hold up over time. The sound quality is excellent, the durability is terrible."
3,Great headphones with one exception,"As others have said, these headphones are comfortable, priced right and they have excellent sound. However there is a fatal flaw: the cord, where it goes into the plug, frays after several months and breaks, leaving you with a set of dead earphones. I'm on my fourth pair. Each one broke in the same place, right at the end of the cord where it enters the plug. My PX-100's, the fourth pair in two years, are fraying in the exact same spot. I won't buy them again. It is very surprising that Sennheiser would have such a flawed design on an otherwise great set of earphones."
5,Best Headphones I've ever used,"to anyone looking for great headphones at a reasonable price these are the ones. They have great sound quality, distinguishing between any instrument in a band is simple with these 'phones. Also to all the reviews that say the cording is poor, I've had my set for three years and I'm just now starting to experience some corrosion on the 1/8"" jack. They aren't the most comfortable or the best sound blockers but for your money they have the best sound. One bonus that I've experienced is that they can go loud enough and still retain enough clarity to set on your desk and replace cheap laptop speakers. My friend even accidentally used them to watch a movie from across the room because he didn't realize that they were plugged in."
3,Headphones are good but the jack is jacked.,These headphones are great for the price. The sound is good although I have had two pairs now and the jack became a problem on both of them within a year. I'm moving on.
4,"Great 'phones, broke unexpectantly","Excellent sound quality, it fulfilled my every musical desire. I've had the quietcomfort Bose headphones, and these are just half a step behind in terms of pure, quality sound. The open-cup design also allows you to hear people and things around you without obstruction, and they can be loud enough to wear around your neck, cups out, to use as a portable speaker. Great stuff.However, they just broke on me without warning. I believe the problem is in the plug or cord, as after two months of faithful, clean service, they simply stopped working at all."
1,A Mistake,"I own a half dozen pair of Sennheiser headphones dating back to the 1980s and all are excellent. These are the large size, both open air and sound deadening. I was looking for a pair small enough to fit in my commuter bag and use with iPod and computer. When I got the PX 100 I found I could not wear them comfortably, the audio was really bad, and they did not keep out the noise of the bus. I gave them away. I then ordered the Sennheiser in ear model and they have been perfect!!Forget the PX 100.Mike"
4,Excellent portable headphones,These chinese headphones are a great buy.I use them to learn swedish with a portable cassette player. The quality of the sound is clear and crisp. These headphones make my learning time a pleasure.I really recommend them to anyone looking for low price and high quality headhphones.
1,Beware the hype,"Having read the largely rave reviews I decided to purchase the PX-100's as an upgrade to a stock pair of earbuds that came with a now defunct Creative Zen MP3 player. I was disappointed to find the sound quality lacking in comparison. To be specific the PX-100's are much to bass heavy and the high end sounds tinny. Tested on my home system with EQ, some improvement noted with bass cut and mid boost but still not as good as the buds. Either I have some really good earbuds or the PX-100's are not all that, I tend toward the latter."
1,"Sound great, but break easily.","My pair had a great sound broke after about an hour when i removed them. I used super glue but they broke again and I threw them away. The sound great but they are weak at the base of the ban where the adjustment fits over the ear piece. They are worthless when broken.I got the pro Sennheiser HD-280 Professional Headphones and the 202s ,they are not portable but they don't break. It's over kill for an MP3."
3,they are okay,these are okay. they have a very good treble. but no bass. i cant believe how low the bass is on these headphones. the noise cancelling raises the rating but these wouldve been a 2 star for the lack of bass. if your buying for noise cancelling these are good but for sound these are awful ive seen headphones for twenty that have better sound.
3,OK headphone,"I have a high expectation since a lot of people recommend it and rated it high. Kind of disappointed when I tried it, ppl next to me can still hear some noise when I am listening."
5,CJ,"I researched many brands before purchasing these headphones in Dec 05. I deployed to the desert and took em' with. WOW! What a great pair of headphones. Great clarity and great ranges -very good sound all-around. I used these headphones alot and they really have performed. They have proven durable and dependable as they were sweat on and violently yanked off my head numerous times. The plastic ""box"" they arrive in is great for daily storage and transport. Would not hesitate to buy these headphones again! No complaints! Fantastic value for the price!!!"
4,Zawesome,Great bass sound! Night to day compared to those that are less expensive. Great portability. Just wished it had one cord coming from the ears instead of two. But still is the best for open sound.
5,Excellent Fidelity and Convenience,"The Sennheiser PX 100 does everything I had hoped, and does not do the one thing I feared. My musical tastes are eclectic, focusing mostly on classical, jazz, and ""other."" This headphone does it all well. My concern about its open design bleeding over sound to the air passenger next to me was unfounded. The neat folding into a travel case is a nice extra. Enjoy!"
5,Excellent headphones,"Simply great headphones. My son loves them. I bought a second pair for my wife. Now I want one... Comfortable, good sound. And over the ears instead of in your ear like buds. Much more comfortable. And a reasonable price. Technically, you can fold them, but we don't do that much. They're always being used."
4,a bit bigger than expected...,"Got these headphones for my daughter, who hates earbuds, but wanted something portable. These headphones have great sound. They take quite a bit of practice to fold, but once you have it down its fine.....I have to say the case is larger than I expected. On the whole they are really good quality."
3,"Good Sound, Fair Comfort",i really wanted to like these. So many reviews. The sound actually seemed a bit muddled. The mid range was a bit strange. Had to get crazy with the Graphic Equalizer on my MP3 Player but still was never thrilled.Also the fluffly head padding material just annoyed me. At the ends of each piece it pinches in to connect to the headphone and just annoyed the top of my head.
5,Very good sound,I've been very happy with the sound in these headphones. If I can keep my cat from eating the cord I'll be ecstatic!
4,First experience,This was my first experience with a Sennheiser product. And I must say it is as good as advertised. Great sound from a reasonably priced product. I have since purchased their earbud type headphones and am equally satisfied.
5,One Of The Best,"These cans in my opinion are one of the 2 best on-ear portables on the market along with the Koss Portapro's. Very comfortable, good quality build, convenient fold up design, great sonic clarity. They sound good connected directly to your mp3 player but in order to get the best sound from these (any set of cans actually) you really need a quality headphone amp to drive them. It really does make a world of difference. Ebay has some custom made pocket amps (Cmoy and their variations) that do the trick for minor Jackson's."
4,Very solid headphones,"These were great replacements for my ipod headphones, when the right bud conked out. Very rich sound, and nice and portable too."
2,Cheap Junk,Don't get me wrong..These headphones are a good deal and have a very good sound quality..For the average guy..But I am a runner and this is the third pair I have went through..They last for awhile and then after running with the mp3 in my front pocket the wires begin breaking inside the chord..Right at the jack..Very cheap designed connections..Even had a repair shop try to fix one set but it wouldn't last..So if there is any movement the wires inside break after a while and the sound starts dropping in and out until it completely breaks and then you have nothing..Very cheap...The need a heavier connector at the end or better grade of wire..
5,Best Sound Quality Ever,"Where do I start? I used almost 20 different brands : Sony, Panasonic, JVC, JWIN, KOSS, and even tried $200 Bose at show room.My ear is picky, I have the very good audio system at home, I could easily identify which shlef system is better. e.g, I compare almost three major shelf systems in stores: Sony, Panasonic, JVC, conclusion is Panasonic is best. I compared Super Zoom camera, Canon SX20, Sony HX1, Panasonic FX35, conclusion is FZ35 stands out.I believe I am sensive to tech products, and my evaluation is accurate.For the earphone , is summary, the Sennheiser PX 100 is best I have in my life. the $200 Bose? Yes, it is good, but I more like Sennheiser PX 100, natual ,mellow sound, bass and tremble just adequte, no more no less."
4,OMG These are Incrediable,"I never knew Music could sound this good out of headphones. I'm so glad I bought these. I don't know how I'll ever go back to anything elseThe 4 star rating is based on the fact they are collapsible. So it has a less then stellar quality feel to them, but the sound is so incredible I don't mind!"
5,Excellent after all this time,"My wife and I bought a pair of the PX100's when we went on our Honeymoon six years ago. Well we're still using them today. They have been all over the country and even to other countries and they're still going strong. The only issue we have now is the pads are starting to deteriorate, but after six years and numerous vacations I can't blame them. These have excellent sound and they don't give me ear fatigue like so many other brands do."
5,Comfortable with no sacrifice of sound quality and compact to boot.,"These headphones have given me years of great listening pleasure, and they still do! I have always liked the Sennheiser line of audio equipment and this headset is just as impressive. Great design that collapses and stores in a crush proof box and keeps the cord tangle-free allowing me to throw it into my knapsack or pocket without worry that it will tangle with other items."
4,Comfortable,"Very comfortable for my large head. Sound is decent, not excellent but decent. If you are looking for bass heavy headphones this is not it. This is good at blocking outside noise even though it is not a noise cancelling headphones, I do not need to blast the volume to block the outside noise. Folds into a nice container that I take with me all the time with my laptop bag."
5,Nice!,"I've only had this set for a couple days now, but so far they are proving to be really amazing. I listened to a variety of music styles through them: rock, classical piano, symphony, acoustic guitar, etc., and was impressed with the quality and distinction through all the ranges. Bass is excellent, and the high-end tones are very distinct. So distinct, in fact, that you really need to listen to only high-quality recordings through these, or else the high-pitched fuzz noise of poor recordings will be too distracting.This set is also extremely comfortable. They are feather-light, and it's easy to forget they're even on. There is a bit of padding on the headband itself, and of course they are fully adjustable. They seem quite sturdy to be as lightweight as they are.I would definitely recommend these. A superb quality for the price, and the sale price just makes it sweeter."
5,The best small portable headphones under $100,"I've tried a lot of headphones but keep coming back to these. The PX 100's have the best sound of any portable headphones I've tried -- only the Koss Porta Pro comes close. The dynamic range is remarkable, and the bass is particularly good for portable headphones. Also, they can be worn for hours without discomfort.So the sound is top notch, and the comfort is good enough. The only reservation I have at all about the PX 100's is that they let a lot of sound out to the surrounding area, so they're not a good choice for libraries or other quiet settings. In that setting you might want to try the the HD 202 (Low end), PX 200 (Medium end, but still sound worse than the PX 100's), or even Etymotic if you have money to burn.If you're shopping around and want more choices, you might also check out the Koss Porta Pro (not the Sporta Pro) or Grado SR60."
5,"Great Sound, Great Comfort","I bought this set of headphones to plug into my laptop, so that I can get music at work. I was pleasantly surprised! The sound was wonderful. The headphone jack of my laptop was more than enough to drive this set of great headphones. Sound quality is excellent. Extremely clear and lots of details. They are also very comfortable. I can wear these for hours on end. I have very sensitive ears, and I cannot last more than an hour on any of the earlier headphones I had... but the PX100 is different. It's extremely light and comfortable!"
4,Pleased with purchase,"I picked these headphones up because I wanted a decent pair that would drown out city noises, but I wasn't after isolation or noise-cancellation. I wear them at work and am still able to heard people trying to get my attention, but when I'm on the street, I can hear my music clearly without losing quality. They don't have the greatest sound I've ever heard, but they're also not top-shelf studio phones. Their construction isn't amazing, either, but they do fit comfortably on my hugenormous head. Their fold-up case thing seems gratuitous, but I use it every day, and have found it a convenient way to transport them when not in use. Good range, and very true-to-recording sound. Overall, I'd say these are one of the best deals for the dollar there are."
5,Just Great,"I have been listening with these headphones for a while and thought I'd give them a review. I'm no expert, just somebody who likes music and walking. These headphones fit the bill. I have stayed away from those earplug type headphones because I don't like things stuck in my ears. I have been walking quite a bit lately so I had to use a pair of Philips ear buds. I thought they sounded OK, until I tried the PX 100's.What a huge difference! Today i Listened to Loreena McKinnitt, Johnny Cash,Itzak Perlman and The High Kings. All sounded vastly better with the PX 100's than with the ear buds. Not only is the sound better, but they are very comfortable and come in a handy-dandy carrying case almost like the kind you would use for eyeglasses. The sound is almost as good as what I hear from my stereo speakers.Can't beat them for the price."
2,Too much bass,"I recently took the plunge and bought an IPod. Impressed by the sound quality, but unhappy with the supplied earbuds, I searched the Web for reviews of headphones, determined to upgrade. Based on the excellent reviews of the Sennheiser PX 100 s on a variety of sites, I took the plunge and bought a pair. What a disappointment. The sound was muddy and distant, with way way way too much bass. The bass seemed to overpower the highs and midranges, making even Sinatra and the Carpenters sound like they recorded with Stanley Clarke or Bootsy Collins. I went back to my $20 Sony headphones, which provides a much clearer and tonally balanced sound in my opinion. Maybe with next year's tax refund I'll splurge for the Bose set"
1,"Okay sound, poor quality","I used these headphones only a handful of times and the sound was okay. The last time, I wrapped the cord around them and didn't use them for a few months. When I tried to use them again, I got sound on only one side. I thought it might be a loose wire before I realized that the wire insulation/covering had worn through, which was presumably the cause of the problem. Again, this happened after just a few listens and from wrapping the wires around them the way you would normally do with headphones of this type. I had to throw them out because they were useless. It's a disgrace to make something so shoddy."
2,Not sure why everyone rates them so high,"So, I bought a pair of these after reading all the positive reviews, and I don't really get it. These are middle of the road quality headphones. The padding around the earbuds is of cheap quality and not comfortable. The sound is just very 'meh'.If you're looking for top quality headphones, then look elsewhere."
2,Not as good as the earbuds,These are not real expensive but I would reccomend the earbuds instead. They are OK but that is about all.
4,breaking em in.,"So far they are good sounding phones.I have used them with my minidisc player and the ipod with good results.The treble is crisp,the bass is a little muddy when hip hop is played but that is to be expected,their not subwoofers.Rock,punk,country and folk sound nice and tight,clear and not to bright.I havent had to much time to give them a proper session and i'm not an audiophile but,they are to me a great little set so far,if they broke i would buy them again."
2,just good enough,for the price it's ok BUT not recommended for extended use. the earpad is so thin and it hurts on my ear.
3,"Sound was fine, cord too long.","My wife was happy with the sound quality, but the length of the cord was a real problem for her. It caught on passing furniture so often she ended up folding part of it and taping it to shorten it. Even then, through a series of improbable events, the cord was sliced. She has never had a problem with headphone cords before."
4,Headphone for Travel,"Based on various reviews I purchased the product. I use it to mostly listen to audio books while I travel. The headphones are lightweight, reasonably sturdy and of good material quality. The case is excellent. The sound with low level ambient noise is excellent. Unfortunately it does not prevent ambient noise so I found the sound to be not as good in the plane. A better ear cover could have prevented ambient noise.Still for the price, it is a good buy."
4,Best Sounding Open Air Headphones but cushions get removed,"After trying many headphones over the years, I am convinced that these are the best sounding open air headphones I've tried. If you are tired of tiny sound with no base on most open ear headphones, you have to try these: you finally get the bass back!!!! One problem is one of my cushions is off about a year later. I am about to get some replacement ones. Other than that, great"
5,ipod head phones,"Wonderful sound! Better than ipod's original ear buds. Fold up easily to store in case or not.Lightweight. Would recommend to anyone interesting in ""real"" headphones."
4,Nice sound quality. Not very comfortable.,"The sound quality is great, just as everyone has talked about. But if you wear it for longer time, say one hour, your ears start to hurt."
3,"First pair lasted, second pair didn't. Cost-reduced = cheapened?","I loved my first pair, but it looks like this product has been cost-reduced and made flimsy in recent production.My first pair lasted a couple of years until a high-velocity 15# cat got caught in the cable and blam! yanked it out of the plug, a reasonable failure.My second pair lasted several months, however BOTH side-pieces have now broken about 2"" up from the ends while wearing them (that awful ""snap!"") and one of the top pads has come off. The new plastic side-piece is different: narrower (weaker), looks thinner (weaker), a different plastic and apparently a brittle one.Production has shaved $0.10 too much off the production cost per pair. I'd buy more of the originals but not the new flimsy version."
2,Bass Buzzing,"I bought these headphones about 2 years ago. I was very happy with them until recently, when I noticed a static sound that is associated with bass. Sound is worse in one ear, and appears to be associated with a blown out ""speaker"". Since I use these once or twice a week for maybe a half hour, and don't run them at excessive volume, a failure at this point seems to be unacceptable. I am going to have to replace them, and not sure if I will reconsider the Sennheiser brand..."
2,"good sound quality, but wire easily broken","It is a nice earphone.. superb sound quality, nice look... But the wire was broken after one year. It was not heavily used. Most of the time I use it at home/work. Such a pity.. everything is still perfectly fine except the wire near the jack:((("
2,Good but thin wire broke,These were great headphones as long as they lasted but the thin wire eventually broke after a few years from putting them in and out of the case and the price of the price has doubled since I first purchased them.
4,My new favorite headphones,"I am a true audiophile so audio quality was of utmost importance, but I also wanted a smaller type of headphones since I don't like walking around in my Beyerdynmics or Grados... I am also wearing glasses so comfort is important. After several days of listening to the PX100 I must say that they satisfy all my requirements - incredible sound for the price and size, small and very comfortable, and even look good!I give them 4 stars for two main reasons: 1) the connector is not gold plated - for Sennheiser I would expect this. And 2) the frequency response is not very flat (the lows are raised to high) so these will probably not sound very good unless you equalize, but most audio gadgets today have an equalizer.Finally, a word of advice: don't judge these headphones as soon as you get them, let them burn in for several hours."
3,Great sound but. . .,"Every single description of these headphones talks about the ""easily replacable ear cushions/pads"". This is a fallacy. The only place I have been able to find them is on Sennheiser USA's website, I ordered them and promptly received an email from them telling me that they are backordered and won't ship until the middle of March. This is extremely frustrating. I can't find these ear cushions ANYWHERE. Other than this big fat lie from the manufacturer, that these pads are easy to replace, I love the headphones. If more stores carried the ear cushions my review would have been 5 stars instead of 3."
4,Great headphones -- foam ear pad replacement tip,"I've had this set of headphones for a while, and they are as good as everyone says.This review is more of a tip for those who own the headset but have managed to lose one or both of the foam ear pads. They are kinda loose and one of them fell off during a walk.Looking for a replacement earpads were a bummer (everywhere online wanted an arm and a leg for shipping). I ended getting a pair of super cheap koss kph6 / ur5 (it comes with an extra set of foam ear pads) and the pads fit my px100 perfectly! It was actually cheaper to buy the koss (which comes with two sets of foam pads) than to buy a single pair of replacement foam pads (generic or sennheiser)."
2,Rattling sounds,"I've had these headphones for about 4 to 5 months, and over that time, they've started to make a nasty rattling sound. It mostly happens during parts with boomy bass, but it's been happening more and more for a month or so, and now it sounds terrible. I thought that I had a defective pair, but the same thing has happened to my brother's pair of PX100's, too. The quality was incredible, but it's not worth having a rattling sound in the background most of the time."
1,right channel died,"The right channel died today. No trauma associated with it. The phones were working fine on my way to work. Put them on after work and only got the left channel. It's the jack. Kind of wiggle it and the right channel pops in and out. Tried the phones on a couple different audio devices to make sure it was the headphones, and yes it is the headphones. What a drag. Bought them less than 10 months ago."
3,"Sounds great, durability not so great","I have been using these headphones for 2 years...While the sound is great, I have had them break on me twice in that period. The first time, they were replaced free of charge as I was within the warranty period. I just had the ""new"" pair break but I am over the 2 year original warranty. Its too bad these don't hold up better."
5,it's a hidden Jewel..,"This headphone is must to get...i was suprise after hearing some of the shure headphones and comeback to px100...it's amazing experience. it has warm bass and warm high sound.I'm a headphone junky but i love all my headphones, except Bose noise cancelling junk.. However, this Sennheiser PX-100 is well worth of you money. Happy listening!"
5,Outstanding headphones,"I've bought more expensive headphones and bigger ones, but these may be the best I've owned. Clear highs, solid lows (you won't get mega-bass, but I'm not a mega-bass type guy -- and you WILL hear every pluck of a bass guitar or slide of a cello) and a pure sound that shines through. Perhaps the only flaw was I wore my first set out in 18 months -- using them almost every day, the right 'phone started getting a little buzzy -- but for the price, that's a minor criticism."
1,Not a good deal,"The sound is ok, not great. The connector is the cheapest that I have ever seen and I doubt it will hold up even under moderate use. For the price I expected a lot better sound, but it is not any better than the $9 sony mdr model. Spend less if you are just looking for a pair of headphones or spend a little more if you want something with superior sound."
1,The most expensive junk headphones ever tested.,"I have Sennheiser PX 100 and Philips SBC HS500 Headphones and this Philips headphones gives me much better sound quality. I can't understand admiration for Sennheiser PX 100 seen in almost every review on the net. Sound from PX 100 is flat, high frequences induces terrible resonance (tested on Enya and Beethoven piano concerto). Philips SBC HS500 are much cheaper and much better! Also, they are more comfortable then Sennheiser."
2,Unremarkable,"I've never written a review here before, but felt so strongly to write due to the incredibly great reviews I read here.I purchased these to compare to my Sony MDR-A44 and send the best to my lady, and keep the remaining. Their sound quality is quite disappointing. Build quality is good, but high end with a new Sony Walkman was dead. MDR-A44's blow these out of the water. Sorry Sennheiser, I was really hoping (and waiting) for comparable or better than the discontinued Sony's. I don't even want them for myself and now returning them. Guess I'll have to take my chances with Sony's replacement for MDR-A44 which I hear build quality sucks. We'll see."
4,Very solid for $30,"This headphones won't blow you away with their sound quality, but in my experience, they're among the best you can get for less than $30.Once you figure out the Rubik's Cube that is the fold away system, they'll grown on you as their compact size and thoughtful design soon earn their mild price tag. If you're hard on your headphones, and tend to go through them quickly, I'd go for these."
5,"very portable, great sound, not the most comfortable","The portable case, and the sound quality is very nice. The headphones make my ears hurt after a few hours though (physically, not sound). The cord is more than long enough for normal use."
4,Sennheirser PX 100,Good sound. A little tight for me so not as comfortable as a light headphone would be expected to be. But I like them.
5,I give this headphones five stars,"I bought this for my i phone, i had them for 4 months, the sound and bass is clear, you will enjoy listening to your music."
4,Really good,"It really a great headphone. I'm not an expert in headphones, but I'm a musician. I bought it to replace my Ipod headphones, this is all I can compare with. They are nice and really comfortable.I guess as a musician, I kind of expected something a little better, but I guess this is probably great for this price range."
5,Comfortable and compact,"I like these a lot. Sound is good, phones are comfortable and fold up easily. Recommended!"
5,Perfect.,"These phones have the best ergonomics I have ever seen on a pair even remotely in this price range. They are absolutely worth it, because sound quality, volume, and build are all excellent.Buy them."
3,Better than my $8 drugstore headphones,The people reviews were great and the price was right so I ordered. I use them in conjunction with a tiny portable equalizer (Koss EQ30) and the sound is OK. Except that I get a very high pitched tinny sound. I would have returned them but I'm too lazy and the sound isn't terrible.
3,I Don't Know,"Maybe four stars, maybe three. I don't know. For Sennheiser, I was expecting better. The wire is cheap, the connecting jack is cheap. Mmmm... Well it is what it is, but I'm not expecting it to last long. Very cheap feel.As for sound, I'm no audiophile but it does well for *me* in this regard, and they are nice and light on your head. I like the fact that the ear pieces fold flat and that they collapse very nicely. In short, I like the design, but the quality is not there for the price. Should have been priced at $19.95 or something very close to that."
3,"great sound, cheap parts?","I bought these headphones for traveling as most of the reviews I had read praised the sound. On the first flight they worked great and sounded amazing. Then on second flight the connection on the plug in came loose. I had pulled on the plastic casing to unplug and the entire wiring harness came apart. I do not know if it was cheap construction or just a design flaw as the connection is straight in instead of a right angle connection that seems to be the norm. With the straight in connection (on most airlines) the wires come straight out across your lap. Any movement on my part put pressure on the connection. I will try to have them fixed, as I said when they worked they sounded great."
5,Best by far,"The only thing I can say about these is get them! They have the best sound of any headphone I have tried, including in the ear styles. For under $40 you cannot go wrong. They easily out perform headphones that cost $200 or more. The only draw back is that they do not dampen external sounds, but that is not always a bad thing."
5,Product worth its money,"I have owned many headphones till date, from multiple branded manufacturers like Sony and Philips. None had the sound clarity like this one. The sound reproduced by this unit is excellent, and the bass is incredible and out of expectation. I am very satisfied with the product sound quality and its price. Yes off course, the unit feels a little fragile and has to be handled with care, if it needs to last long."
5,Better than the PX200s,"I have owned these for over three years and have loved them since day one. Good bass and overall sound. Unforunately I got greedy and decided to buy the PX200s for more bass. Bad idea. From the first time I listened to music on the PX200s I was disappointed. I did comparisons of the PX100 and PX200 on my iPod, the PX200 is pathetic compared to the PX100.I am going to buy another pair PX100s now because after 3 years the padding on the earpieces is tearing. I love these headphones."
4,Sounds good to me,They sound good and work great. Not an audiophile at the moment so all i can say is I've had no tears in the sound at all and it comes in clear to me. Getting it into the case is a little tricky but not enough to deter anyone from buying it. Try them out
4,No You can't Hear Them Over Drums,"The main question everybody wants to know is can you hear them over the drums, and the answer is no. Great design/sound for a solo accoustic act though. I recommend trying out in a store first, but then again you must factor in that every location's sound dynamics will vary. Still not a bad deal on a PA."
5,WOW - The Best Dragon Toy Available,"When our 3yo son asked Santa for a Dragon for Christmas my husband & I just about fell over because he'd never talked about dragons previously (I found out later he plays with them at preschool). Frantically, I started my search. Most Dragons are simple plastic toys that have no moving parts, altho' they did fit within our basic requirement of an ""open play toy"" that allowed my son to use his growing imagination. But this Dragon far exceeds our requirements - it has just enough movement and allows nearly limitless imaginative play. He pretends the Dragon is breathing fire as it moves its head when the bottom lever is pressed and that the Dragon is ""flying"" (when he presses another lever to make the wings move). The arms, legs, and tail are also positionable. My son has hardly put this toy down, and my 5yo daughter asked ""if you can find a Dragon like that next year, I would like one for Christmas."""
3,"Success without college, a failure !",They dont tell you in advance that this book is geared more towards someone right out of high school with the advice . Also the book leaves you with more ?'s than answers. I found it to be a waste of $ for me and I could have done without it !
3,"Good book, but it is starting falling apart already","This book is filled with a lot of useful information. Anyone who wants to know anything about building in a clear, easy to understand way should get this book. The diagrams are very nicely draw and are good sizes so it is easy to read. I really like it. For content, I give this book 5 stars. But for the way it is made, I give it 2 stars! I have looked through this book every day for the past 2-3 months. The pages are beginning to come loose out of the binding. The cover is too soft, and gets damaged too quickly. It is very disappointing. If this book was a hardcover, I would have no problems with it. I don't think I am handling it roughly either, just turning the pages over and over again. That is what you are supposed to do right? So why is it falling apart? I imagine in a year or two it will be in pieces."
5,No nonsense reference book for DIY,I had the 98 version and i just bought this one. it really goes between engineers books and for dummies books. I would just call it the bible of construction reference and have a nice day.
3,Too technical,"I found this book much too technical for the home owner looking to learn about remodeling and building a house. Buy this if you are a builder, but choose another if you want simple explanations."
3,Gold Hoop Earrings,"The diameter of this item was listed as ""interior 40mm"". The 40mm diameter measurement is from outside edge to outside edge, not interior. The interior diameter is 32mm."
1,"Interesting book, wrong title","I thought that this book was an interesting liberal spin of the war, but felt that it should have been called ""Tell Them I Didn't Lie""."
2,"Me, me, me","Jackie Spinner is everywhere in this book--always between the reader and Spinner's subjects. She presumes to know how others feel, what they understand and motivates them. It becomes tedious and annoying. There is double trouble because her twin weighs in to lay on more and more personal pathos. Everyone is frightened in war, but not everyone blabs about it until the reader gives up in disgust. I am tired of young journalists who can't keep themselves out of stories. A wise editor told me when I was starting, ""Never, ever write about yourself or how hard it was to get the story."" It is a good general rule to be violated only by reporters of great talent, and then rarely."
4,Awesome Disc,"These guys are really great. A solid mix of breakdowns, slow, fast and technical, with some melodic stuff thrown in as well. Great feel for the kids into hardcore from the late 90s, though I think this cd came out in the early 2000s."
4,"If you love music, this is for you.","Simply said, this album is good not great. Only a few things hold it back from receiving the coveted fifth star, most importantly, that the ""singer's"" scream doesn't quite have the throaty edge to it. (see Red Wedding) This is what gives the higher register screams their edge. Also, the recording quality leaves a bit to be desired, which is something people familiar with this style may not mind. On the other hand, there are a great deal of things this record does right. The fact that this band doesn't tune down to the floor allows room for the bass to be sonically noticeable. The chaotic frenzy that rears its head on tracks like ""Get up you son of a bitch, cause Mickey loves ya"" and ""Nothing we say leaves this room"" is a much welcome retreat from the usual Hatebreed-esque metalcore that dominates this genre. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who loves music, not just screaming music."
5,Serious Cats!!!,Holy Cannolli! These guys are some serious cats with some serious gigs! I saw them at 7 black cats and Jeff and the Dishwashers opened for them! Jeff opened for THE BLED! I nearly jumped out of my bass cabinet when I saw em'! They are ready for serious gigs with Royal Crown or something. Serious cats!
1,Boring,"Unbelievable. I read a review describing The Bled as ""the perfect antidote to pop hardcore"". I was like ""Wow, something that's heavy and melodic without being emo-wussy"".What I got was the exact opposite. Simple guitars, breakdowns we've all heard before, bad screaming vocalist from a singer who would look more in place in a garage rock band and really boring melodies. Screamo sucks and it pisses me off when I think of how good early 90's hardcore/metal was even though people where too busy listening to Green Day and Pearl Jam wannabes to take notice. At least Converge has a new album coming out."
1,cbopp,"I've seen alot of kids at school and work wearing ""The Bled"" shirts, so i decided to check it out. Most of the time, emo is horrible....and this is no acception. Lyrically, this is just an emo kid complaining about how much he hates his life of rock star luxury while occasionally throwing in Pauly Shore quality jokes. Musically, its ok at best. The drumming is pretty decent, but the guitar lines and breakdowns lack so much in creativity. The only people i can imagine liking an emo band like this are kids who feel repressed because their parents yelled at them for not doing their chores. If you want real music, check out Dream Theater or Michael Schenker Group."
2,Just cuz they're good live,"I really enjoyed The Bled's music, their album and all that. But, they snubbed me when I saw them. By snubbed, I mean they wouldn't even take a congrataltory (SP) hello. But, for being guys that aren't that talented, entertaining show. You bought pot rom my friend Obi-Trice."
2,Un-original.... BORING ... (yawn) zZzZzZ,"I first heard the song ""I Never Met Another Gemini"" and I liked it so I checked out the rest of this album. Thank god I didn't actually spend money on this retarded CD... I thought it would be safer to download it, just in case it sucks... which it does. I could go into a long elaborate description of why this band sucks and I could discuss which aspects of this band suck (guitars, drumming, creativity or lack thereof etc) but I honestly feel that even criticism of this album is a waste of my time (let alone listening to it). If you wan't boring, unoriginal cheese metal-core/emo riffs in an all filler CD, be sure to pick this album up today."
5,woweeeeeeee,Man these guys kill. I heard the drummer mike in a band called Little League about 5 years ago and I knew at that point he had some real talent. They're definately not as good as Fuge but they're the next best thing. buy the cd and all the merch you can.
5,Pass The Flask,"These guy's are tight. Have not heard anything lately that is this good.This cd is a MUST buy for anyone that love's metal,alternative or punk.I'd give it six stars if I could.I see this going platnuim."
5,the best music ever done by Harry Beafonte,I believe that this is his best work ever done. I love how he does different kind of songs that are on this cd. Day-O/ or commonly knowen as the banana boat song is one that eveyone knows by heart. Which is good to be able to know that you are getting a cd that you will like
4,Too Short,"The only downside to this great nostalgic album is that it's too short. There are only 10 songs and they go by as swiftly as the Jamaican wind (sorry about that). Harry Belafonte at his crooning best, dedicating 10 quality rythms (minus the female voice in ""My Sweetheart from Venezuela"") to Jamaica and in a lesser degree to Venezuela. Buy this album if you want to listen to how people partied in the Latin American 1950's and don't know ""nada"" of Spanish.It doesn't receive the full 5 stars because one would think that 50 year-old music would be sold with a discount by now. But that's copyright and a completely different matter."
3,It's immoral for the kindle,"If you are buying this for your kindle beware. There are so many words spelled incorrectly and just plan wrong. For instance: The word should be ""barn"" but in the kindle edition it's ""bam"" over and over. I get it when I am reading but it is extremely distracting and for the money I paid it should be correct. I'm not sure who is to blame but there are dozens and dozens of this same type of errors thoughout this book. Shameful and I am not sure I will buy another Brian Freeman book if this is what will be the norm. The storyline is good but I am only halfway through and not sure I can finish because of so many mistakes."
5,I loved the book despite the bad conversion to the Kindle edition,"The book was great. There's many reviews on the book so I'm not going into it a lot. But it is a great mystery that keeps you guessing at who did it and what happened. You never truly know what happened til the end though it gives you a lot of hints throughout the book. but there are tons of typos during the conversion to kindle. Most notably the word ""the"" is spelled ""die"" many times, and many periods are missing. Once you figure it out though it is easy to keep reading through the mistakes. However there was a couple times the word was completely unreadable that I had to skip over them and not know what the author was writing. And a couple more times when a new paragraph wasn't indented making it confusing. But even with that I highly recommend this book."
2,Props to the critic from Publishers Weekly,"Immoral is an okay time filler, but in no way is it the masterpiece some people say it is. The critic from Publishers Weekly said it all, and very well. Sure, it's a surprise when the killer is revealed, since it came out of the blue with no foreshadowing. Imagine playing Clue only at the end you find out that the killer wasn't even one of the players. A book can be entertaining without being 5 stars, but Michael Connelly, Robert Parker, Ruth Rendell, and Harlan Coben are authors that write the really good mystery. Is this book entertaining? Sure. But great? No."
5,"Like Sheldon used to be. Better than Corbin, Patterson, Cook and even Cornwell","I have been reading mysteries for many decades. I think I remember Sidney Sheldon's 1st book, something about Midnight. I read all of James Patterson's books and Patricia Cornwell, and many of the great mystery writers. Except for Sheldon, none of them hold me to the middle of the book. They are boring, same old, same old. This new wtiter, Brian Freeman has written a mystery novel I couldn't put down. Everytime I thought I had it fiqured out, another good twist. The other writers are pumping them out too fast and in my opinion going on their good name in the mystery world. Finally and exciting novel. Keep it up Mr. Freeman, at this point, I would read your books before Patterson,Cornwall, Koontz, Cook, Hoag, and even Clark. Grant you, this is strickly my own opinion."
1,This was published?,"This book is a disaster. The ""good"" characters were so one-dimensional and unsympathetic and the ""bad"" characters were so wooden and unimaginative that you didn't give a damn what happened to whom. Then to make it worse he gives us a killer straight out of left field. Usually that allows for good mystery and suspense, but the killer was so ridiculously thrown into the role as murderer that it's pretty clear that he didn't know whom to pin the murder (when it finally happened) on. I cry when I think about the wasted trees..."
1,Possibly my least-favorite book this year,"I'm astonished at the raves being posted for this book; I guess there really is something for everyone, and for Brian Freeman's sake, I'm glad. This book is a snore - the characters are cleanly divided between wooden and cardboard, and the story development lurches like a warped staircase outside a Minnesota beachhouse. You want a brilliant debut novel? Read ""Gods in Alabama"" by Joshilyn Jackson. You want an accurate cop thriller worthy of your time and effort? Read Robert Tanenbaum. You want to experience a sophisticated look into the psychology of the criminal mind? Anything by John Case or Brad Meltzer. You want drivel? ""Immoral"" is right down there with the latest garbage from James Patterson. Well, to be fair, at least Freeman writes in complete sentences."
2,Better choices out there...,"As I worked my way through Immoral, I realized once again why I love to read....it's for the delicious turn of phrase, the perfect choice of adjective, the rhythm of the lyrical sentence. Unfortunately, this novel contains few of these. The plot is okay, capably described by previous reviewers, but there is little else to redeem it. In short, Mr. Freeman can tell a story, but he can't write. In contrast, I am in the middle of Ian Rankin's latest Scottish detective novel -- now THIS guy can write."
2,"Title should have been ""Derailed""","Immoral does a lot of things right. It has a great setting, some good character developmnt, some interesting dialogue and interaction between characters. It builds to a climax in a classic,modern, legal whodunnit sort of way and then it just vomits on itself. It implodes in a sticky mess that makes no sense and offers no surprise. It just makes your eyes roll.Part of a great mystery is setting up a situation that resolves in a manner that makes sense, was in some ways forshadowed, but ""gotcha"" cause you missed it. This book falls on it's face once it gets past setting up the situation. It's as if someone told Freeman to ""wrap it up"" and he rolled the dice and lost.The ending jumps the tracks."
5,Outstanding !,"This new author is the best to come along in a long,long time. The book is OUTSTANDING from page one right through the trailer he has at the end ( an extra short story). Lots of reviews say a book is a page turner but this book is even better than that. There are no boring spots in his story...it is excellent all the way through. Can you tell I love his story? His style? He's great! What a book!"
1,Great Hype....Bad Book!!,"What an over hyped piece of trash.....the sex scenes are like a 14 year old boy's immature fantasies....the revelations at the end of the book are highly far fetched and just plain stupid...The author spends more time on the main character's sex life than on real plotting....two long drawn out scenes of individuals urinating....boy ain't that exciting?Try the ""Woman in White"" by Wilkie Collins to see what a real writer can do with a mystery.....However most modern readers should love it since pop fiction is all they crave...creativity be damned.."
2,"Started out great, then burst.","Brian Freeman writes well and the story's pace was pitch perfect. I liked the first twist (even though I saw it coming) but the twist at the very end was awful. It's like the author cheated. I don't want to give any spoilers so that's all I'll say, but it ruined the whole book for me. Also, the sex scenes were poorly written. I'd rather have no sex scenes at all than have them written that way--more like technical instructions than passion.With that said, I'll definitely give Freeman another try when his second book comes out. I just hope he doesn't toss out another ending like this one."
2,Nominated for an Edgar . . . but why?,"The middle third of this book is pretty good. That's the part that is a police procedural even though the police follow no procedures I've ever heard of. The first third, the courtroom drama is probably good if you care for legal mysteries. The last third, where the author descends into soft porn, and realism going totally out the window, is just to be endured. All this sprinkled with cliches (jeans so tight you need a knife to cut them off?) and thrown into a blender to make the storyline as convoluted as possible.There is talent here. With a stronger editor and a decision on what genre he's writing, Mr. Freeman has the ability to write a novel that is qualified to be nominated for an Edgar. But this wasn't it."
2,Silly little book,"My first and last time reading anything by Brian Freeman. It started out pretty good, but then when he got to describing the lesbian Nancy Carver, his homophobia and hatred of lesbians came raging out in his completely unrealistic and stereotypical description of her. From there, the entire book went downhill. He painted every single other adult female as surrealistically beautiful with incredible bodies. Apparently he's never seen an actual female police officer: they don't fit his stereotype. His Hispanic police officer in Las Vegas sounded more like a pimp than a cop. And the ending just cracked me up. His own wife and her ex-husband?? Give me a break!"
3,Are you kidding me?,"OK, sure, for a first timer, it's not bad. But, this book is filled with so many clichés and generalizations of people that it is just too much to swallow. Sure, I finished it as I wanted closure on the mystery, but I found myself trying to pigeonhole the author to figure out his politics based on his character. Hopefully, I'm wrong, because the chauvinistic tone and unrealistic portrayal of women was too much to take."
5,A Must Read!,"I was shocked when I read that this was Brian Freeman's first novel! The characters are true, they come to life and draw you in. The plot kept me guessing 'til the very end - which is hard to do. I love that the story spanned a few years - much more realistic. Can't wait for the next book."
5,Absolutely Gripping!,"I thought IMMORAL was a fantastic novel from start to finish. I read a lot of thrillers and mysteries but I didn't guess 'whodunit' with this one. Once I started this book I just kept reading until late at night when I forced myself to put it down. I might just as well have read to the end, though, as I didn't go to sleep but instead lay there thinking about the story and the various plot twists for as long as it would have taken me to finish the book. I wasn't disappointed in any part of the book, and felt that the characters and their situations were tightly drawn and true to life. I can't wait to see where Lt. Stride ends up next!"
4,Grabs your attention and does not let go,"Lieutenant Jonathan Stride, a widower, in Duluth Minnesota, has worked earnestly trying to solve the untimely death of Kerry McGrath, a teenager. Rachel Deese disappears and the town is in a panic thinking there is a serial killer on the loose. As the details are revealed about Rachel; more questions than answers arise. The media and his boss are breathing down his neck to solve the crime. Anticipation and expectations of a guilty verdict hit a fever pitch at the trial. Along the way, you get know more about Jonathan, his work and his private life. Some secondary characters are so one-sided they are just there to move the plot along and are never heard from again. Not perfect but an exciting whodunit with plenty of twists."
4,First Book.....Very readable!,Good plot. Characters interesting. The only reason I didn't award 5 Stars was a little too much sex for the main character. Every woman he sees is beautiful and they all want him in the bed which he succumbs to. Some authors have to exploit sex due to their inability to hold the reader's attention without it. This author doesn't need to do that.
2,Disappointing!,"Maybe I'm just jaded. I liked this book at first but soon became bored with it. For one thing, I'm always leery about books that have all these blurbs from different newspapers, authors, etc. They obviously see things in the story that I don't. And, Dennis Lehane, he is not!!! It's nice (for the sake of the author's future sales) that so many folks really enjoyed it."
3,"Not the best, but still worth having","I have quite a few James Beard books. If you like his style, you won't be disappointed with this one-as usual, the instructions on technique and so on are very clearly presented, and the illustrations are attractive. However, you may find some of the recipes overly endowed with fat content (well, this is James Beard after all!) and somewhat biased against some very popular categories of bread, such as sourdough or wholemeal types of breads. For a more comprehensive bread book, I would recommend Bernard Clayton's New Complete Book of Breads over this one; and if you're a real beginner when it comes to hand-kneaded (non-bread machine) bread, you can't beat the bread technique section of Julia Child's The Way to Cook. But it's still a book well worth having on your cookbook shelf, together with its sister book, Beard on Pasta (which I would rate a bit higher than this one."
5,Beard on Bread,"As an avid bread baker, I found this book to be interesting and useful. The recipes are good standards, and the added inputs by the author made a good read. I'm sure to someone not into his history and his opinions might consider it to be just ""blah, blah, blah"", but I enjoyed it."
4,Beard Writes Cook Books that Work,"Beard On BreadI've made bread for years, graduating to sourdoughs from Sourdoughs International and finally to desem sourdough, derived from the wheat itself. Over the years I've consulted many sources--for ideas as much as for the recipes.The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book: A Guide to Whole-Grain BreadmakingandThe Bread Builders: Hearth Loaves and Masonry OvensIn Daniel Wing's The Bread Builders I found Alan Scott's simplified approach to building a desem and using it. Laurel's directions leave much to be desired, but she brought us the desem in the first place. I got Beard on Bread mostly to review technique and for recipe ideas for modifications. So I got Bread on Bread to read and for guidance. I was well repaid. His reputation for excellence in cookbook writing was well founded. His views on fats and salt need to be downsized, however."
3,"Should Be: ""Creative Decoupaging With Old Greeting Cards""","I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I bought it thinking there would be good ideas to use the cards I receive, particlarly holiday cards. Well, first of all, most are based on decoupage, not a wide variety of techniques. Secondly, most of the projects shown use really nice ""artsy"" types of cards and would not have the same effect using the majority of greeting cards being circulated these days.I also wish the layout and instructions were better presented. Projects are divided into months (though they could be used any time of the year)...it would have been better if grouped by similar projects. Each month has a photo of several sample projects, then you have to look for the instructions a page or two away...all of which start out by saying ""Refer to General Inst. on pages 6-18""Nice if you're interested in decoupage ideas."
4,Looks nice and not too bulky.,It comes as described and works well. I does not take up much counter space and is strong and high enough to hold a large bunch.
4,Headphone holder.,"Although this ""banana holder"" has somewhat questionable build quality, its form and function are flawless. I use this to hold myDenon AHD2000 High Performance Over-Ear Headphoneswhich it has been doing since Christmas 2010. The point where the wood and metal meet is not as smooth as it could be. The metal appears sturdy, but bends easily. If you have a wild monkey in your house that's going to be throwing bananas across the room onto this holder then I would advise against buying this product."
2,Item received damaged,"It is very nice looking, however, when we received the item the hangar was loose from the base with no way to tighten it. We returned it through Amazon for a credit."
3,construction weak,"This unit looks very nice. I received a damaged unit though and it is clear to me that the construction is suspect. Where the metal inserts in to the base is held by a weld on each of the metal rods and not very deep. Ultimately, I would question the durability. This is one of the nicer looking banana trees though."
5,nice looking banana tree,"As far as functionality, it does its job, not much to say except for the fact that even if you're left with one banana, it is possible to wedge the tip into the rounded top part of the tree. As far as looks, it was worth paying a little extra and get one that has some wood in it."
1,Banana holder,"This product is overpriced for the level of quality. A similar, higher quality product could have been purchased at a local store."
2,Sierra Banana Tree Holder,"The item arrived packaged well, but the wooden base has dents. I wanted to return this item, but figured it would go back-and-forth costing more in shipping than it was worth. I think shipping was too high as always and will re-think shopping online."
2,butter dish,"This has been returned since the dimensions listed are not the dimensions of the dish. We like the LARGE butter sticks that you get from warehouse stores, and are trying to find a butter dish that they will fit on. If the dimensions advertised on this dish would have been correct it would have been perfect, but it is MUCH smaller."
3,Hmm.,"The first book in it ""night"" was the only one I really liked. I didn't even finish reading dawn and day."
4,Thought this would be different,"I've just started my journey into reading about the Holocaust and Nazi's. My first was Victor Frankl's ""Man's Search for Meaning"" and I appeared to have an incorrectly preconceived notion on what a Nobel Prize winning author would write about; actually I don't quite know what I was looking to find. The read was intense yet quite easy to understand; but, did little beyond giving the sense that if you survive an incident like this you question why. It has furthered my interest in reading other books on the timeframe. I would certainly purchase it again."
3,Depressing,"A laborious trilogy. Everything is so black. I understand it was a horrible, horrible time in history and for the people who had to deal with it and are still dealing with it. How they kept their sanity under such conditions and live with such memories is amazing. The only light is in the last few pages and is worth the labor. God gets blamed for the acts of the devil, however."
4,Night Trilogy by Elie Wiesel,"Night Trilogy by Elie Wiesel is a story about a city of Jewish people who are being killed by a guynamed Hitler. The main characters are Hitler, The Weisel, and acity of Jewish people. Hitler is a leader who tries to kill all the Jewish people.The Weisel is a guy who tries to lead all the Jewish people to freedom, and the ""Jews"" are the people living in the city being killed. My favorite character in the story is The Weisel because he tries to save all the ""Jews.""I can relate to the ""Jews"" because I am Jewish. I have never doneor felt any of the things in the story.I liked the book because it told me all about what happened to""Jews."" My favorite part of the book was when the families gotseparated from each other. I would not want to change anythingin the book.I recommend this book to older people because of all the gore, but I also would recommend this book to Jewish people who want to learn about their history."
3,"A good book overall, but confusing and unorganized","This book is a great source of symbolism and metaphors. The author gives a great understanding of the events that took place from 1940 until the present day.The three books put together form an intricate web of symbolism in which each event plays off another to leave the reader with a sense of suffering. The symbolism of death is with Elie throughout his entire life starting out in the concentration camps.Due to the fact that the author jumps around often, as far as time periods go, it makes the book very unorganized and hard to follow.As a whole, the book is focused on Elie's past and trying to forget it, but keep it close to him at the same time. So often, we try to change our past when the focus should be on the future. Elie is unable to do this because there is too much for him to forget and not enough for him to change."
4,Death is alive!,"Wiesel is of all eyes, all his eyes are of death. Death is alive in the Night Trilogy. The Night Trilogy speaks of unforgetable horror that took place during World War II. This book not only speaks of what went on during the Holocaust but also how it effected the lives of the survivors.By combining Night, Dawn, and The Accident, Weisel captured the entire perspective of the Holocaust. Elie Weisel showed great symbolism within all three sections of the novel. Connecting into a whole, the three novels gave a view of the many emotions expressed throughout Elie Weisel's life.This trilogy deserves to be shared throughout the world. All who consider death as a final end when one dies should read Weisel's opinion. Surprisingly enough Elie Weisel captures you in his world of eyes.""Death is a being without arms or legs or mouth or head; it is all eyes. If ever you meet a creature with eyes everywhere, you can be sure that it is death."" - Kalman, grizzled master."
5,great!,I read Night in highschool and loved it--decided now that I need to read the rest of them--this was a fantastic deal!
4,Nice collection,"I thought the trilogy was a nice collection of stories, both real and fictional, of experiences from the holocaust. Night gave me a different perspective of what it meant to be a survivor of this tragedy and how it changes a person. The Accident was pretty interesting. It makes you think about your fears and belief system. I liked having all three in one book. It was a fairly quick read."
5,"The Night Trilogy, a review","It is, in a nutshell, the most powerful book I have ever read. It challenges you not only emotionally but intellectually as well. It redefines your views of humanity and the world. To call it a masterpiece would still be an understatement. A definite must-buy for everyone who cares about himself and about the world he lives in."
3,A Powerfull Message,"Wiesel's The Night Trilogy has a different effect to each of its readers. This book is filled with many metaphors and symbolic phrases. Each one being traced back to the death of those who were close to the narrator. The book shifts from the incidents of the Holocaust to other events in the narrator's life.The overall story takes place during the events of three combined novels. Each unique in its own way, but combined, tell the story of a Holocaust survivor. The novel Night tells the story of a pre-adelescent boy who witnesses life in a ghetto and Holocaust camp first hand. Dawn shows the changes that occur in the narrators life after the Halocaust. His outlook on his life and others changed along with his religion. The Accident depicts the discovery of Wiesel's reason for living. Overall the Trilogy is filled with a sense of the Holocaust and the effects of it on an individual."
3,Beautifully illustrated but ...,"This is a beautiful book with many, many well reproduced illustrations, and if that's all you want, you're in good shape. The, writing, though, is vague and imprecise. What's missing is practical guidance. There may not be a prettier book on the subject, but surely there is a more informative one."
2,Disappointing,"Ok for basics but not specific for the varieties of plants for propagation. If you want to learn about root cuttings and division it's good, but don't expect much detail when it comes to specific plants, ie; when to take cuttings or when to divide certain plants for particular varieties. Very basic."
3,Will come in handy,"Good reference book, will come in handy. Not much more to say as I haven't ready through it yet. But I like what I have read."
5,Best book on plant propagation,"Book contains 46 pages on introductory propagation methods, followed by very specific information on propagating these plant types: 44 pages on trees, 54 pages on shrubs, 64 pages on perennials, 16 pages on annuals, 20 pages on cacti, 28 pages on bulbs, and 28 pages on vegetables and herbs. In the back are a glossary, an index, and north america hardiness map. Very complete.If you can grow it, the instructions are listed in this book.Book contains hundreds of small, but helpful photographs that demonstrate a process or identify some plant anatomy.Solid information, well worth the money!"
4,Excellent book overall,"Being new to propagation, I have found this book extremely useful and have successfully tried some of the techniques. My only complaint is that the book does not go into further details about how to care for the young, newly rooted plants. For example, how do I overwinter a newly rooted hydrangea? How long after it's rooted in the rooting medium can I safely transplant it? What do the terms ""grow on"" and ""grow under cover"" really mean? The book assumes you know little details like this already.But really, considering the breadth of information the book is trying to cover, I'd say it does a good job of it. It is clear and easy to understand and the instructions are easy to follow. And, yes, it really does list every single kind of plant. I haven't looked one up yet that I couldn't find in this book!"
3,could have been much better with little effort,"This book is fine for basic and ""high-level"" overviews of propagation of different species. The introductory section on different propagation techniques was interesting and informative. However, it seemed odd and a little frustrating to me that the hardiness zone for each species wasn't stated. Also many species didn't have photographs- a small image with each listing would have benefited this book enormously. This is a good book, and fine for a reference if you already know which plants you wish to propogate- but with a few minor modifications it could have been great."
5,Great book,This book shows exactly what to do to get plants growing Ilike the fact I can graft trees to to get better fruit to grow
4,reference,this is a good reference book for those who want to learn more about the various ways to propagate plants.
4,cya Harry,"I bought this lp about 25 years ago and glad to of rebought it last year. Nilsson voice is so versitle on this cd, and is at his best. Eventhough it is not the best lp he did, it was at his best(if that makes since). Anyway this would of been a 5 star review if I would of received the 2 bonus tracks of ""Joy"" as it stated in the order, but what the heck. Although he is gone now we still can hear him on ""RCA RECORDS AND TAPES"" lol. So long harry!"
5,I can't believe someone didn't like this.,"That anybody would dislike this album so much as to write such a negative review is beyond me. This album is simply wonderful. There's not a single track here that doesn't shine. Carl Craig became a musical hero of mine after I heard this album for the first time. I had heard some songs of his previously, some of which appear on this album, but never made the connection to the artist. Slam Dance, The Climax, & Parking Garage Politics are all reasons enough to buy this album. Anybody who appreciates fine craftsmanship will love this record. It beats the pants off of nearly all other house music I've heard. The longevity of these songs in such a competitive and newness-obsessed market is illustrative of how profound this man's ideas were and still are."
1,I don't get it,"Minimalist house might be easy for a d.j. to mix, but it's not listening music. So why release a CD? I bought this and sold it. I guess I like innovative experimental techno like Jeff Mills, Richie Hawtin, and some U.R.. Carl Craig gets so much props I thought this CD was a sure thing. The title suggests something futuristic and interesting not retro minimalist house. It's a nice mix, the beats kick... but each track is like a drum machine(?) and like 1 other thing. the mix is not deep what so ever. no ambience. I thought craig did jazzy beats. He's in Detroit where they got a kickin jazz scene. he should work with it.THis CD ain't even as good as french house. He ain't from chicago so he don't got the proper disco or house vibe that tight. whatev. I don't get all the props."
1,I don't get it.,"This album thoroughly disappointed me. In fact, this album embodies all of the classic criticisms of techno. It's simplistic, repetitive, uninspired and lacks any soul. Most tracks on the album go nowhere and it's generally boring. It took me three weeks to get through the entire album. This was due to the fact that I could not listen to the entire thing in one sitting. Occasionally, I attempt to listen to the album, in the hope that I have missed something but, I fail to see any redeeming qualities to this CD. This album pains me to listen to. I was so disappointed by this purchase that I have considered throwing it away but, I have decided to give it to a friend, instead. In sum, don't buy it unless you've already heard it."
3,mistaken identity!,"I read the ""Letters from the Cape"" by Lady Lucie Duff Gordon in the unannotated version, and when I saw I could read comments I downloaded the sample. But there is a case of mistaken identity. The Lady Lucie Duff Gordon who travelled to Cape Town, and later Egypt for her health is not the person described at the start of the annotations, Lady Lucy Duff Gordon, the fashion designer who lived some 40 years later. Reader beware! Get the free version of the book (which is a great read, especially if you know the Cape of today) and Google the name (Lucie, not Lucy) for more background."
2,uninspirational celebration,"scymanski has an ok story here. price has a good one about the gorgon. that one was very enjoyable, and had some lovely details. otherwise, this was dreary read. so many of these stories were not only badly invented, but seemed so uninspired to. i almost felt sorry for the writers, for making so bad stories. i think this is chaosium's worst."
5,Worth every penny,"This single is absolutly amazing, Forget December and Konstantine alone make it worth the buy, as this is the only place you can get them. Unlike the Ready...Break's version of Konstantine this version is not live, but completely studio recorded, which in my opinion allows you to more appreciate the intricate piano work done for it. A definite MUST HAVE for any fan of Something Corporate."
4,"Cute, but drags a little toward the middle.","My twin toddlers love Elmo and Sesame Street videos. This is one of the videos they are willing to sit and watch, but it doesn't captivate them like Sing Yourself Silly or Kid's Favorite Songs. The second adventure with Big Bird drags a bit long for them, and they wander away from the TV and start playing with their toys, etc. The third adventure tends to bring them back, though. I should be glad that they have other interests than TV, but we only let them watch the one video a day, and I prefer it to hold their attention."
5,great field guide,"This is a great field guide. The pictures of birds are wonderful. The thing I found more handy than I expected is the color guide tabs. It makes looking up a bird you have seen much easier using a ""mostly colored"" index. Brilliant."
5,Birds of Iowa: Field Guide,"""The Birds of Iowa Field Guide"" is the first and greatest source I have found to identify birds in my own Iowa backyard. The 270-plus full-page color photographs are not only excellent quality, but they are organized in easy to use color coded sections that allow you to flip through pages quickly based on the color of bird that you see. For example, the male cardinal can be found in the red section, the female cardinal can be found in the brown section.Of special interest are the author's personal notes which are included among the descriptions of everything from size to nesting habits. Range maps on each page clearly show when and where the birds will be found. Beginners will find the tips for identifying birds and other bird basics most informative.For the Iowa birdwatcher, this book tops the list because there's no need to search through pages and pages of birds that cannot be found in Iowa. All in all, it is outstanding."
4,Great Book,Love the book - so easy to use. Keep it by the window and look at it all the time. I would love to see more pictures of each of the birds.
5,Useful Book!,This is a wonderful resource for bird lovers. I sit by the window with it as I watch my bird feeder. I had no idea the names of all the birds that appear every day and this book has helped me identify them all. It has large clear color pictures and great details on each type. Having it organized by color is very helpful and its small size makes it great for bird watching on the go. I loved it so much I bought the Florida book for my Mom.
3,So so,The manufacture quality was not up to commercial grade and the material did not really help me. If you can't tell a joke to save yourself then this would be a great purchase. If you want to improve your already average or better joke telling skills then I don't know that you will get much from this.It was not awful and it was not great.
1,Not for Me,Maybe I am just too young. Saw the stage show and thought maybe I would like this better but alas no
3,Island Dreaming,Great tunes but I did not remember them being such short snippets. I imagine it is a direct movie track compilation.
5,SOUTH PACIFIC st is better than movie itself,"The SOUTH PACIFIC screen transfer, although a great box office hit, has always had its problems (strange color shifts, bland performances and heavy handed direction). Fortunatly this does not transfer over to the best selling soundtrack album. Much of the ablum's success is due to the care taken by Alfred Newman and Ken Darby in thier wonderful scoring of the music. All the vocals are great (althgough I do wish Doris Day had been cast in the lead). This recording needs to be expanded so that we can hear full renditions of some of the edited songs and more of Newman's rich, wonderful underscore. Although the Broaway recording of SP with Mary Martin is probably the more ""definitive"" release, the sountrack is the lushest, best sounding of all the SOUTH PACIFIC albums."
2,a poor quality recording,I love South Pacific and I am very disappointed that the sound is so poor. It's like they took my LP of South Pacific and gave it to some hobbyist to filter using the free software you get with an inexpensive CD/DVR Writer.
3,This CD falls flat,"This is the same recording of this show which was released on vynal as an ""original soundtrack recording"" which of course, it was not really.The main title isn't the same as in the movie, and the finale isn't the same. this album also leaves out the overture, intermission and exit music which can be found on the video.They are coming out with more complete soundtrack albums all the time, why can't they come out with this one?"
1,Zombie Planet Trilogy,This isn't a trilogy. It's two movies with film footage from the first two as a third. And the films are all turds...
1,exceptionally awful,"Bad writing, bad acting, bad sound, bad filming, bad plot, bad everything that could possibly go into a single movie. And then multiply that by 3 and you get the horrible waste that is the series. Actually, you only get to multiply by 2 because the 'third' movie is nothing but clips from the previous 2. So add bad fake."
3,"Works good, but the sound is unfriendly","When I received it, I thought there might be a broken part in it because the box was badly smashed.Despite of my worry, it was okay. It's light like Hoover Platinum, but has more suction. It will serve me well for daily use.Although, I don't like the sound. This may be a Dirt Devil thing because the other one we have has the same problem. Along with the regular low sound, there is a high-pitched annoying sound. It hurts my ears and I don't think I will use it when I have a headache."
1,broken after a few uses,The thing stopped working and gave a burning smell. It's only been a few months and we've only used it a few times ... disappointing ....
1,"It's like a toy vacuum, except without the fun lights.","Length:: 0:34 MinsSorry about the sound - this vacuum has a horrible screeching sound to it -- but I wanted it to be clear that the vacuum was on.This is the worst vacuum I have ever used. The little hand-held, battery operated Dirt Devil I used to clean out my first car was light years better. The vacuum does not pick anything up. Period. Not on hard wood and not on rugs. You have to see it to believe how bad it is. It blows things like cereal flakes and other crusty stuff around, and it just moves fuzzies around. I would never, ever, ever recommend this to anyone. I want to give it away to someone, but it's not worth anyone's time to pick up.I can't believe things like this are still even made."
1,Disappointing,"For the first month of having this product worked well enough for the price. Now it's like i'm wasting my time vacuuming because there is no suction, what use to take a few minutes of cleaning has turned into almost an hour of semi cleaning. I don't recommend getting this product at all, unless you just like to look at it."
5,Perfect for a small apartment,"Perfect for my small apartment. Great price and easy to use. It's not a fancy vacuum, but it does the job and I wish I didn't have to part with it when I moved!"
1,Absolutely Horrible,"Puffs of powder and dust spit out the front of the vacuum as I vacuumed my living room carpet with carpet fresh powder. The unit did not guide straight over the carpet and suction was at a minimum. After using the vacuum for a few minutes, reread the manual to make sure I wasn't missing something then tried again. Same results. Therefore I packed it back into it's box and returned it. I purchased a unit from another vacuum company.What a little dirt devil indeed.I do not recommend."
3,not what i thought.,7 amp not 12 very loud and winy not powered hard to push very short cord bagless cup needs to be emptied every room or so that was the cons-pros are cheep- small-suction-maybe something else but i will update later my opinion don't buy this go to the upgrade there is 4 others that must be a better choice for 10.00 more go for the extra or you will be disappointed good luck.
1,Never again....!!,"This is the second time I purchased a Dirt Devil product and there will not be a third!! This vacuum cleaner does not pick up, so what good is it? It's junk and I agree with another review that ""you get what you pay for"". Maybe they ought to change their name as the ""devil"" is a deceiver (a vacuum that does not pick up my parrots' feathers??!!) OMG!"
1,Horrible peice of crap,This sweeper is the worst piece of crap I have ever spent more than a dollar for!!! I would have been only slightly less farther behind with a broom! Buyer beware!!!!
1,Wouldn't buy,"We bought the Dirt Devil thinking it was going to be a great little vacuum to travel with. Yes, it is very easy to travel with. Bad thing is, the very 1st day of use the belt broke and it started smoking. Next day I bought another belt, same thing happened. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Maybe I just bought a bunk one. Just my opinion. We wasted our money."
2,High Maintenance!,"I have had the Dynamite for over a year now.I liked that it's light and it did suck well.But...The brush broke in less than 6 months. I replaced one for more than $10 +S&H; from Dirt Devil site.It hasn't been working lately, so I decided to check it. Broken belt. Fine. Normal maintenace. Should only cost $3. But I checked the brush also, and it can hardly turn because so much dirt got stuck inside.I'm not about to spend another $10+ to keep up with this."
1,decent but so loud!,"PRO: lightweight and compact, adequate suctionCON: filter is fragile and needs to be cleaned often. sometimes when first turned on there is a loud high pitched noise that goes away after a minute or two.You are getting what you pay for. Not bad, but not super either.*EDIT, A FEW MONTHS LATER...*Just got done using this and my ears hurt. The noise doesn't go away anymore. I'm gonna try to get my money back."
3,Great but not miraculous.,"After reading the reviews here, I thought I was getting the cream of the crop as far as bagless upright vacuums go... not so.Pros:Container fills up really fast, which means it's sucking a LOT.Very lightweight.Easy to assemble, it pretty much comes already assembled!Cons:Not very wide, so not ideal for large rooms.Does not let you set how close/far it sucks to the floor (so whether you're vacuuming a hardwood floor or a really high carpet, it won't let you adjust the vacuum).I have to use a lot of strength to push/pull it around on my high carpet... I'm not sure if it's because it is vacuuming that hard, or because the vacuum parts run too close to the carpet."
2,king of clogs,This vacuum clogs every 10 min of vacuuming if you have carpet.No height adjustment and on low profile carpet and hardwood there is no action. All the wind and dust comes on to your face when vacuuming.
1,Worst Vacuum Ever.,"The handle will not stay up when I try to vacuum my carpet, making it a very painful process. The box was not in the best shape and this thing has not worked correctly since arrival.To get them to fix the problem with the broken item I bought they made me drive 30 minutes away to a 3rd party repair shop. This took about 10 days to ""fix"", I briefly tested it at the store and it seemed fine. As soon as I got home and used it for more than 2 minutes the problem returned and the handle would not stay up.I don't know what to do here besides cut my losses and buy another brand, terrible warranty and pitiful product."
2,"works just as described and very helpful, will certainly be buying again ~~ if & when the times comes that I need another","works just as described and very helpful, will certainly be buying again ~~ if & when the times comes that I need another"
5,Powerful,"I highly recommend this to all busy moms like me. Very convenient, no hassle and most of all, very powerful vacuum. A lot more better than I order from Shop TV networks. A mighty creation!"
4,Makes a great 2nd vacuum,"We use this guy as our ""upstairs vacuum"" so we don't have to lug our big Kenmore up and down the stairs. It's a nice light vacuum with lots of power, and is great on stairs. The suction is actually so strong that it makes it hard to push. My 8 and 9-year old kids have to really put some muscle into it when vacuuming their rooms. But those little punks are too soft anyway; pushing a vacuum with super duper suction is probably the worst thing that will happen to them all month."
4,good for a small vacuum,"I was a little skeptical about buying this because I have always had hoover or bissel vacuums, but I'm very pleased with this. For a small lightweight vacuum this works great. You do need to empty the cannister a few times, depending on if you're doing the whole house or just an area. However, I always empty the cannister after each use so its not a problem for me. It's lightweight, easy to store, easy to handle. I have a cat and it picks up cat hair just fine. I would recommend for someone in an apartment or a dorm."
1,"strong rubber smell, warranty/support is useless","Motor start producing strong rubber smell from the fist day of using the vacuum. After disconnecting belt I found that smell coming directly form the motor. Called Dirtdevil support, they extended warranty to 2y (many thanks !) and redirected me to the repair shop, but shop refused to replace motor even under warranty. Warranty and support is useless. I cannot use vacuum in side the house."
2,its ok but there are better,"it works, its powerful...if you just want to vacuum the floors and not use the extending ""arm"" this is a great vacuum....but the vacuum tube that you use with the brush etc is reallyyyy short. I could't vacuum the top of the bed without having to pick up the whole thing because it would't reach. I would not recommend this, there are better ones out there."
3,Good basic vacuum,Got this vacuum as a back up. My housekeeper does not like it because the hose is too short if one is trying to use this machine to clean anything but the floor.
3,Sucks good...but extremely small!!,"I just received this in the mail today, its a great little vacuum...for a small apartment or mobile home not for a large home! For the price I could have gotten a bigger one at a store! I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 because of the size, everything else works great on it! Hope this helps!"
1,Nothing but a headache,"Bought this Vacuum six months ago and just in its 2nd use the belt came off that runs the brushes. I thought it broke went to the vacuum store bought another belt. Put the old one back on and then it snapped, so I changed belts and continuing having to keep putting it back on. Figured I'd leave this review while I was on here looking for a new vacuum."
2,You get what you pay for...,"It works fair, I use it on a very low pile carpet only. It takes multiple passes to pick up dirt."
2,Falling apart after 3 short months,"Bought this vacuum to replace my really old canister vac. At first, I thought it would be great. It does have great suction. But, the canister gets plugged up easily with pet hair and then it won't pick up until you empty it. The accessory hose is way too short and pretty much useless, but it just fell off of mine today. So, now it's really useless. Not what I expected at all. It was cheap and well, you get what you pay for."
2,good for carpets,"This vacuum works well on carpet. If you have a combination solid flooring and carpet, you should know that on wood floors, it will pick up dust but not larger items, such as fir needles from a Christmas tree. It will simply scatter them around causing one to go over the same floor multiple times. And there is no setting for floor or carpet."
4,Good product,I like this product as it clears the dirt effectively. The click lock handle to adjust the height is great. 25' power cord is too good for me to cover whole of my living area. One thing i dont like is the stretch hose is very small to reach table tops. Overall its a good product for this price.
1,Did work....for about a week,"I got this vacuum at Target for the same price. I got it home, it worked fairly well for a week. I noticed the brush on the bottom, only spins when you push it, it does't move with a belt. One day I was using it and it sounded like something got stuck. Took it apart, checked it all, nothing is stuck. The foam insert is full of dust only after a month of use. I cleaned it, put it back and the suction is stil very low. It won't even get fuzzies off the carpet. I wish I had saved the receipt but I lost it on accident. This thing is only going one place, the trash. I should have known the price tag was too good to be true."
3,Its tolerable and works alright,"I knew this wouldn't have a ton of features when I ordered it, but it really is very very basic. It seems to work well, but at the same time it stirs alot of the dirt into the air. There is a very strong stream of air that comes out of the front of this vacuum while in operation. I do get alot of dirt up when I vacuum and it is very easy to clean out. I like that part alot and that is where the vacuum earned its stars. It comes with all the standard hose attachments that I am used to. Also it is fairly compact and very light in comparison to most vacuums. I'd say the only downfalls are that it is hard to push and the stream of air that comes out the front. Other than that I am satisfied with this vacuum."
3,Just OK,"I've had this vacuum now for about a year and I'm underwhelmed. After all the positive reviews, I thought it would be perfect for our area rug and it just isn't quite good enough even for that small area. I need to do many, many passes with the vacuum just for the rug to look, well, vacuumed. Maybe I got a dud. I also found the hose on the short side."
1,Clogs easily and died completely after 8 months,"This vacuum was nothing but trouble from day one. It kept clogging and the clogs were very hard to remove due to the way the hose is positioned. I spent hours trying to fish out clogs using my fingers, sticks, etc. Every time I noticed that the air wasn't circulating inside the canister, I would find that it was clogged. We don't have any pets. We do have children. This might be a nice vacuum for someone living alone with very light vacuuming to do. I'm not sure. All I know is that it was a huge pain to us. It finally quit picking things up entirely... won't suction anything. I'm not sure what the problem is, but it's not worth it to us to fix it seeing as we were frustrated with it to begin with. We definitely wished we had gone with another product."
4,Gets the job done - unbeatable for the price & weight,"It is light-weight, excellent and ideal for a small house (think 1 or 1.5-bedroom), unbeatable for the price. Does carpets very well, floors acceptably well. If your main consideration is lightweight, maneuverability and price, cannot find a better one. easy to store, lift etc. Lack of horsepower means it will not likely suck up every last dirt particle especially the hard-stuck ones"
1,Unused debris receptacle,"90+% of the debris this item sucks up gets impacted in the corrugated hose. In other words, you run it until it refuses to pick up a scrap of paper, then get out the piece of coat hanger wire with a hook on the end, and extract the nasty stuff from the hose.I have to believe that the company has its employees writing reviews, since my previous reviews of this product seem to have disappeared.I intend to ask the firm to either give me a refund, since the device does not perform as advertised, or send me one that does meet expectations.The problem is in the design. Call it a fatal birth defect."
2,Doesn't have very much suction,"We bought this as a vacuum that we would need for a year and a half and it has turned out that it doesn't have great suction. the hose gets clogged often too. It's pretty lightweight, but not very good quality."
1,Received Electric Shock,I bought this after reading so many good reviews about it and you cant beat the price.However I received electric shocks and sparks when I turned it on. I've setup the return and mailed it back to Amazon. Hoping I'll get my refund.Maybe I received a bad unit but I am not planning to buy this model again.
4,Good product,The vacuum cleaner is strong for such a small machine. You can see the dust and dirt it vacuumed and easily empty the contents right after use. It's light and works well. I have a dog that sheds a lot and this vacuum has definitely helped in that area.
4,Perfect Size,It's the perfect size for my son's appartment. Hopefully he'll be happy with it. I like that the handle is retractable
3,Not Good!,This isn't working for me. Not sure if I got a lemon but the dust gets everywhere inside the vacuum and it's a chore and so darn messy to clean.
5,I LOVE this vacuum.,"Man, my apartment was DIRTY. Who would have thought an apartment for three 20-something year old men could get so nasty? No worries, cause I ordered this red puppy, and man does it clean. It may not be as snazzy as a Dyson, nor as cool as a Roomba, but this Dirt Devil has got heart. Mad heart, and I respect that. If this is in your price range and you need help tidying up an apartment, this will become your new best friend."
5,It sucks.,"Sorry, had to say it, but at least it's sucking the way I want it too. Vacuum has good suction and is fairly light weight. The canister does fill up rather quickly, but emptying it isn't difficult. It the first time I used a bagless vacuum and am happy with my purchase."
4,nice one,I am happy with this item but i thought it was a bigger one but it works for what i use it for.Thanks
2,less than a year and it's partially broken,"when it worked it seemed to have worked well but it didn't last long. I use it less than once a week and now about 10 months after I bought it, the dust bin is showing some cracks... I don't know how that could have happened. not sure if it's gonna shatter in the middle of an operation or something so I'm concerned now."
2,Not for most home use.,"Pros:- strong suction- long cord- low priceCons:- Badly designed for most home use. Unless you're using it to vacuum large stretches of straight carpet, you'll find it very frustrating to use. For nooks and crannies, corners, or brushing furniture, you need to detach the hose from the body to use the attachments. The hose is too short, so you have to have the main part close by, which defeats much of the purpose. You also have to lock it upright before using the attachments. It is heavy, awkward, and prone to fall over, and the attachments are badly made and tend to detach from the hose and extension tube."
3,Dirt devil Vac,"I love ths bagless vac, it's small with a lot of power. 2 negatives; the hose is too short and dust escapes and can be seen on the canister."
3,suction,bought this used couple of times...but the price paid is much higher...other brands i paid couple of dollars more but got very good powered motor...this suction is not great
4,Really Sucks...,"I live in a studio apartment exactly the size of a 1 car garage. The floor is tile and sheet vinyl except one large area rug. This cute little mini vac does an excellent job, even picking up leaves that have fallen off my plants. The cord is plenty long and the canister easy to remove and empty. The only reason that I did not give this vacuum 5 stars is the hose. It works well but is very short. I tried to vacuum out my window tracks (standard height) but the hose was a bit short even with attachments. Over all a good vacuum for a small area."
4,Good for a second vacuum,"This is small, but perfect for my upstairs. The handle folds down for easy storage. Suction is good, and it's easy to maneuver."
4,Great little vacuum,"I needed to get a new vacuum because I moved and have a cat now. Since I received this back in September, I have no problems at all. I take very good care of my things and this has never caused a problem. I love the sucking power, it is truly amazing. It does a good job and picks up dirt I didn't even know it's there. Great little vacuum!!"
4,Awesome deal,I've had this vacuum for about 4 months and it works amazingly well for the price. It's a breeze to use on hard surfaces and still works well on regular carpeting. I've only had difficulty pushing it on some very plush area rugs/runners that I have. Very powerful. Easy to clean out.
5,Good little vac,"This is a great little vacuum. I love that it is bagless. Its a great value, really picks up a lot of stuff"
2,Not enough power,"This thing tried its hardest, but I gave up after 2 uses. It simply doesn't have the sucking power. I was having to go over the same spots multiple times on hardwood to get everything. I'll be ordering something more powerful."
2,poor suction,"This vacuum does not have a strong suction. It lumbered along barely getting up crumbs from our shag rug for 6 months then finally stopped working. The suction got worse and worse, until it wasn't worth using it anymore. I wish that I had spent a little more money and got a vacuum cleaner that worked and lasted."
4,Loud,"Has great suction, but has a high pitched ringing like something is wrong with it. Shouldn't have to repair it myself since I purchased it new, but maybe some belt dressing will help."
3,Too small to do too much damage,"Though arguably powerful, this vacuum can only be described as a mini-vac. Yes, the suction is awesome, but you have to consider as a smaller vacuum it isn't capable of picking up larger debris. It also takes longer to clean any room and fills up faster than its regular sized counterparts. I'd recommend it to those with limited carpeted spaces, or as an office vacuum."
2,Ok for the price,"I was looking for a new vacuum in the $50 - $100 range and came across this with great reviews. It was about $20 cheaper than the Bissell I was going to purchase, so I decided to give it a try. It does have pros: it is small, great if you have to carry it up or down stairs and it actually does suck up a lot of dirt. But the things I hate about it outweigh those for me. It's really loud, mine emits this high pitched piercing sound the entire time it's on. It drives me crazy. Also, the attachments are short. I need to use the attachment tools to vacuum in window sills that are up higher in several rooms. It just doesn't reach. Third, it's very messy to clean the filter. I wish it had a ring around it like some vacuums that I could just rinse under water. I definitely have to take this outside to clean the dirt out or the dust just flies everywhere. Wishing I would have purchased another Bissell."
4,"Don't select ""Frequently Bought Together"" option","Great little vaccuum for the money - enough said. I took away a star as a caution because of Amazon.com. My caution is to avoid the ""Frequently Bought Together"" option for a HEPA filter and two replacement belts. They are the wrong ones. The filter they send it an F1 and it should be an F2. They send two style 12 belts and they should be style 15. Come on, Amazon get your act together."
3,Good deal for the money,"I like this vacuum for the price I paid. It is small and requires more paths to vacuum the room. It has no level adjustment for different kinds of carpeting. If I had to buy anothe vacuum, I would probably not get this one again. I miss my bigger one with more adjustment. That being said, I do however, like the price and it does a decent job of cleaning."
4,Awesome For An Apartment Or Dorm Room.,I was very surprised at the powerful pickup this small stature vacuum has. It replaced a regular sized vacuum for me when I needed a quick and inexpensive replacement. I wasn't expecting much but this vacuum gets the job done! It is easy to maneuver and lightweight. This a perfect vacuum for a senior citizen or someone pushing a vacuum from a wheelchair. It is loud so if you live with other people you will have to adjust your vacuuming times. I didn't like the short accordion style hose that reaches from the vacuum and that you put the attachments on. It was too short and is the only reason I marked the vacuum down a star. I still recommend the vacuum because of its cleaning power and price.
5,Sweet Vacuum,"Love it. It is pretty loud, but picks up a lot of dirt. The best part is that you can see everything that you have just vacuumed!! Easy to empty and store...great little vacuum!"
2,Not Impressed- spend the extra money,"Bought this vac in Dec based on the reviews. First time- worked great. Second time, belt broke. Waited for a LONG time for replacement belts to be shipped. First one broke. Second one is still going. It has now totally lost suction. My advice is to hang onto the box so you can return it. I guess I got what I paid for."
4,This thing really sucks!,I have a dog and bag cleaners were just a hassle. I really like that this one doesn't have a bag. It's also very light.
4,Dirt Devil Dyanamite - Great vacuum!,"A great vacuum for the price. Not a lot of bells and whistles, and that's fine. Light weight, easy to use, and It works almost perfectly.It would have gotten 5 stars except: it's quite loud (a higher pitched sound than other brands), and it exhausts out the front (not optimal).But as stated - it works just fine! The Dirt Devil engineers did a great job designing it as well. The filter comes off and goes on smoothly, it opens and closes with ease, and it practically puts itself back together after cleaning out the dirt chamber.Would definitely recommend it!"
5,absolutely amazing!! Get this!,"I love this vacuum. We have two dogs who shed everywhere. We use this vacuum on carpet and the wood floor. it doesn't scratch the floor or furniture. it's easy to assemble and clean. we do clean out the filter each time..the dust flies around a bit, but we do this outdoors and as low to inside the garbage can as possible. It works for us!!"
3,Decent for the Price,"This vacuum cleaner is good for the price. Sadly, it stopped working after about six months. If it wasn't for the breakdown I probably would have given it five stars."
4,Dirt Devil Dynamite,"Vacuum has very good ratings on Amazon. I support them. We purchased this looking for a light weight vacuum that still cleaned like a full size vacuum. This unit works well. It works as well as any vacuum we have ever had. It is light weight but still has the power. The only cons I may mention is that due to its light weight, to some people, it may appear a bit small and has a relatively small container that needs to be emptied about every other time."
4,durable,"This Dirt Devit Vacuum is very useful in so many ways. I am a college student and I think it's a perfect size to have, where it's not too big but not too small. It's easy to filter out the dust inside the vacuum and so on. I would highly recommend you to purchase this!"
1,broke quickly,"I bought this vacuum for about $50 a year ago and it broke in about 8 months.If I try to use the vacuum, it spits dust out of the exhaust and all over the place. it does the complete opposite of what it's supposed to do now. instead of picking up dirt, it just spreads it... horrible. You really do get when you pay for."
3,Broke after a year,It started making loud rattling noises to a point where I cant even hold in my hand and move it. Changed the belt and no help. I don't think it is a good product
4,Pretty good,Con: It's a little hard to move around on my thick carpet. It's very noisy. It sometimes blows the things away you're trying to pick up.Pros: Small and compact for easy mobility and storage. Low price. Long power chord. Pretty good cleanup. Nice that it's bagless.
4,Good for the money,Good for the money but a little smaller than I thought it would be. Has plenty of power and does a good job.
2,"Initially impressed, now disappointed!","I have had this vacuum for about a year and 3 months. I was initially impressed; however after approximately a year of use, the vacuum is not doing its job! I have given it proper care (as recommended in my manual), but it has stopped ""picking"" stuff up off my carpet. My carpet looks the same after every use. If you are considering this product, my recommendation would be to spend a little more money, to get better quality. In my opinion, a vacuum is an investment!"
2,Oh well.,"I really liked this when I pulled it out of the box. I have one room in my house that has carpet so I'm not looking for anything fancy. It is loudish (don't mind). The real problem for me is that there is no real height adjustment that I can find. There auto height adjustment is either a joke or broken on mine. As a result the suction pulls the face into my new plush carpet and I cannot push it forward without serious effort. Upon further examination, the very front weels are only about 1/2 inch in diameter and they don't move up and down. My carpet is probably 1/2 inch deep so, no go. Anyway, If they had just made the front wheels bigger and put an adjustment on it it would work fine for me. This vacuum is probably great as long as your carpet is not too deep or plush."
5,"great price, great vacuum","its pretty and light but powerful! it works great for carpet in small apartment, even as good as those expensive big vacuum."
5,Small vacuum Big power,"This vacuum came in in two days. It's so light in weight that I was concerned how well will it suck? So I started with one bedroom just to test the strength. Wow! I can't believer all the dirt and dust it picked up the first time. I can finally retire my 15 years old Hoover that weighs like 100 lbs comparing to this one. BTW, it light enough to train you younger children to vacuum their own room."
2,Save your money!,"Unless you have very little to vacuum, buy something else! This machine is painfully underpowered. The only reason it picks anything up off the carpet at all is because of the brush. If you try to use the hose and attachments, it barely can suck up dust."
4,Great little thing,"This one has strong suction, and is very small and light. Does it's job well. I would say get it in the 50 dollar range."
3,Mixed Review,"Here are the pros: Strong sucking power, very lightweight, great price.Here are the cons: cleanup is very messy, cord is too short, hose is not easily removable.I use my old vacuum for hose cleaning and miss its easy cleanup. At the same time, this little guy has great sucking power and is so cheap that I don't know what I'm complaining about."
1,less than 8 months and does not work properly,"I have had this machine since June 2012. First when I got it I was amazed of how it works. It was very powerful. In the past 2 months, it has not been functioning properly. After the suction of a place, when you lift it or move it, it rejects(throw) what it was vacuumed. It is like moving dirt from one place to another.I am really upset about it because I have not used it that much since I live in a very small apartment with no kids."
1,Poor suction light weight,Pick up is poor. Only had a few months and already looking for a replacement. Don't bother buying. Keep your old one.
4,Great,"I just received this vacuum. It is great with an excellent sucking. I never thought that the carpet in my small apartment was dirty like that. Very good machine, yet the reason why I gave it only 4 stars is the very loud sound it has. I thought it will be a lil bit calm as it is still new. The sound disturbed me. Every other thing in it is good. So far so good."
2,Not very much sucking power,"The reviews for this looked great, small, low price, lightweight, great sucking power... BUT I disagree with the sucking power. Sure the canister gets full of dust, etc... But the canister is very small. The brush does a great job fluffing up the carpet to make it LOOK like it is cleaning it really well, but the suction is awful. Especially with the hose for the stairs. The suction is so bad, it won't even suck off the hairs/ dirt that the cleaning brush picks up. My carpet gets a nice fluffing, leaving most of the dirt in the carpet. Especially the hose for the stairs.CONS: BAD sucking power, short hose, and short attachment arm, cheap attachmentsPROS: Lightweight, low price, small, easy to empty canisterThe CONS out-weigh the PROS by a long shot."
4,great deal,"This little vacuum is better than I expected it to be. It works perfectly well, is not over-noisy, is lightweight and takes up little space. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a small inexpensive vacuum. It's just right for my apartment.I spent a while browsing vacuum cleaners when my old one started needing replacement, reading the reviews and the details.One thing I noticed, you have to clean the filter quite a bit and it is accordion-like in shape, so dirt gets in those creases and makes it hard to clean. Too bad I can't use the vacuum to clean it! Still, it's not a great bother. Worth the price, does what it should and does it well."
1,Do Not Order the Suggested Parts - Filter and Belts,"The extra belts and filter Amazon recommends for this vacuum cleaner, and shows as a package purchase deal, are not the correct ones. You will be sent a ""F1"" filter, which is twice the size of the one it needs. The actual filter that fits is half the size, much smaller, and is an ""F2"". Also when you opt in for that package, and the recommended 2 replacement belts, you will be sent 2 ""Type 12"" belts, which won't fit. This vacuum actually requires ""Type 15"" belts.The sad thing, you won't figure out you've been sent the wrong parts until you find or get an Owners Manual, which of course shows the correct parts. Shame on Amazon for recommending the wrong parts with the purchase of this vacuum cleaner."
3,just so so,"I purchased it on black Friday, it's cheaper than ever. However, I don't think it's perfect. It's so noisy that nobody can inside the room except you."
5,Love it,We have a corgi/german shepherd mix dog who sheds a lot so I was looking for a vacuum that's good for pet hair. I love this one. It's light and easy to move around and does a really good job.
3,Beware,"I purchased this then returned it. There are 2 things you must know before you buy it. First, the height cannot be adjusted. It is some type of auto-height adjustment. It did not work well at all for my carpet which has a medium pile. I am 6-2 and of average strength and had a VERY difficult time pushing this thing because it was too close to the carpet. If you have a low pile carpet, it will probably be fine. Second, it is quite small. It would be appropriate for a small room or office, but not a whole floor."
4,Nice little vacuum!,"Well, you get what you pay for. This was exactly what I needed for my little 800 sq ft apt. I have hairy pets, so I wanted a small vacuum with a rotating brush- usually the smaller vacuums just suck and don't have the brush so they don't pick up pet hair off of rugs. After my first run through with this vacuum, I was disgusted to see how much hair and dirt my old vacuum hadn't picked up... and pleased to see how clean my rugs finally got :) No more hair stuck to the rugs! Hurray! I gave it a 4 star rating because the suction just isn't as powerful as my old vacuum. Oh well, guess you can't have the best of both worlds (especially for $50). Overall, it gets the job done just fine- it is small, lightweight, and easy to use/ dispose of dirt and hair. I would not recommend this vacuum to someone with a large house- it would be way too small. But just right for a cozy little living space :)"
1,Loud and stopped working after one year,"Bought this vacuum in June 2011, it came with a small defect, contacted the seller and received a prompt replacement. However, about 2-3 months ago, the vacuum stopped working and we cleaned out a clot pipe, and it was making loud noises since then even though it worked. This week, it completely stopped working and would not turn on. Checked the usual troubleshooting, and nothing helped. Will check with the seller again and see if they can do anything about it. Will update."
1,Chokes on Pine Tree Needles,"Okay, it choked and clogged on the noble fir needles from our Christmas tree - it was pretty sad.This vacuum is fine for the price. It's much smaller than I expected, definitely a compact model, with about a 12"" vacuum width. It's a good size for a 1 or two bedroom apartment, but not really suited for a 1500+ sq foot setting. Since it clogged easily on something so light and small, I cannot recommend this little guy to anyone. I had a dirt devil slightly bigger that i bought 5 years about before it burnt out prior to this model for $60 at target. It worked well. I can't say the same for this model."
4,too much expensive at amazon,The product is good but amazon is asking too much money. Same vaccum cleaner is available at walmart for only $39. I got to know after I ordered it on amazon.
2,You got what you paid for,"I have this one for over a year now, and I am going to give it away.Pros:- Cheap price (you got what you paid for though)- Extention cord is really long- good suction- nice attachment pics (allow you to clean the edge of the wall)Cons:- very noisy- unable to fit under bed- clean the paper filter is such a p-a-i-n! Now I have to clean the filter at least twice every time I use it.- I really wonder if the so called HEPA filter is the real thing.- the exhaust blowing downward and stir up dust everywhere (this is the worst part). It might work better on carpet but it's not for hard floor.Bottom line, I will never choose bagless vacuum anymore and I would definitely buy a real HEPA filter vaccum such as Electrolux EL6985B Harmony Ultra Quiet Canister Vacuum."
5,Great Purchase!,"I love my vacuum! It's light weight, cleans good, and the handle is adjustable to height so my kids love vacuuming their bedroom!!"
2,Good on the onset but...,"Initially after moving to the States, I bought this because mainly of the price. Since I was used to having maids clean house for me eversince I was born, I knew nothing about cleaning! Now here on assignment in the States, I had to do the cleaning myself. In the beginning it was ok, seemed to suck up everything in sight but then the power wound down, no idea why though. I thought it was because that it outlived its purpose since it was cheap. I bought another one thinking of the first time I used it. Now I being sufficiently adept at vacuuming now realize that what I bought really sucked ever since I recently purchased a Shark vacuum lift away that cost almost $400. It's been a year now and the Shark has not changed in efficiency. All I can say is never go for cheap when it comes to something that one really needs for cleaning!"
2,VERY small,"this vaccum, while nice, light weight, and powerful in proportion to it's size..is VERY VERY small. it looks more like a little girl's toy. while it may be adequate for a smallish apartment, it is not up to a larger home. the narrow width can reach in small spaces, true enough, but to sweep a 20 x 13 foot room requires many moves back and forth movements that our previous vacuum (a now-dead bissel)"
5,Great at picking up pet hair,"I have to agree with others who wrote that this thing is amazing! For the price, I didn't expect much but was convinced to buy it after the positive reviews. I had 2 rabbits and a cat and was vacuuming every day with my previous vacuum cleaner. I wanted something powerful but didn't wanna pay a lot. The first time I used it in my living area, it filled the canister! This was a day after vacuuming with my previous cleaner. I was amazed and shocked at how much cat and rabbit hair (as well as dirt and dust) was still on my carpets! Quality wise, it's decently built and doesn't look like a higher end model, but considering the price paid and the job it does, it deserves 5 stars."
1,Won't even suck up Cheerios on tile floors,"This vacuum does not have a lot of power at all. I have all tile floors and feel I have to go really slow so it picks everything up. My one year old spilled Cheerios and when trying to vacuum them up, the vacuum wasn't powerful enough to suck them up. I was left with smashed up Cheerios on the floor instead. It is very light-weight and compact, but it needs a few more amps of power to actually clean. I've owned this vacuum for 6 months and still use the broom to sweep up whats left behind."
1,sucks-oh wait no it doesn't,"not sure how little others are trying to pick up but I bought this essentially for one room and it doesn't pick up much, has to be emptied too frequently and gets clogged due to poor design. This is destined for the trash."
4,Does what it needs to do.,Works great...i love it. If you get the scented filters u don't even need carpet powder. 4 stars instead of bc its loud.
3,light and okay for the price,"its a okay vacuum cleaner and oviously good for what we pay for. you'll probably need to frequently buy lots of filters.For $60 its not bad as a second lighter vacuum cleaner but it requires more maintenance than your more expensive cleaners; for e.g. filter, change of belts etc.."
3,Doesn't come with a filter,"The vacuum shipped with no issue. When I turned it on to vacuum it was picking up dirt, however dust came flying out of the front of it. The picture displays a filter and my assumption was a filter would come with it. I then went back online to find out what filter it should have and it suggested the F1, so with an immediate need I ran out to get it. The filter didn't fit, so I order it online, and the F1 still didn't fit. I should have read the directions, or called dirtdevil instead of relying on Amazon to lead me in the right direction, because an F2 filter is needed, which is half the size of an F1. I called dirtdevil and found a local dealer to purchase the F2 filter."
1,DO NOT BUT! Broke after4 uses!!,DO NOT BUY!!!! Horrible piece of crap. i used it three times and the motor seized up. I had gone overseas and just threw away the box after moving so I am not even sure I can return it. I am contacting Dirt Devil and requesting my money back!
2,Not Recommended,There is a major design flaw in that the vacuum exhausts extremely powerfully directly in front of the machine. The exhaust was strong enough to blow papers off a counter and blow down a calendar. It has terrific suction but this design flaw makes it unacceptable to me.
3,Not so great,"Loud, difficult to empty, but adequate for a small space. This was purchased to fill in when our good vacuum broke. Old one is repaired and I don't even know where my daughter put the Dirt Devil.Recommended with reservations."
1,This stuff blows! A total waste. Better off using Dawn Dish Soap.,I bought ten gallons of this stuff for my parts washer and tried it full strength. The only thing it cleaned was my hands. Just pushed grease around. Finally used a bit of Simple Green and it took the grease right off.Stay away from this product unless you want to waste your hard earned cash.
2,Waaaaay too Small,I ordered these to replace a pair i wore for years and had recently lost one.These are less than half the size i anticipated so sent them right back.Really disappointed. They are soooooo small...not as big around as thetip of my pinky finger.
5,14K Yellow Gold Half Round hoops,Very good product. Simple but elegant. Wife had previously lost one of her other earrings and this was the best replacement. She enjoys them a lot.
5,Great workplace earrings,I love the earrings. The hoops are small enough to wear to work and large enough to be noticed.
4,Good purchase,"These small gold hoops are a nice purchase - good quality. They don't have much weight or heft to them, but they have good color and shine."
2,Duragold 14k Yellow Gold Half Round Hoop Earrings,I am less than happy about the earrings as they are not as presented on the site.I was seeking earrings that are 0.75 to 1 inch in diameter. These rings were presented as being .75 inch in diameter but when we opened the package - the rings were less than about .5 inch in diameter. Oh well.
3,Less gold than expected,"The hoop part of the earring was thinner than expected, but they look OK. Glad I got it on sale."
1,NO SATISFIED,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED THIS ITEM. DEFINITELY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. THE PICTURE MAKES IT LOOK SO BIG AND THICK BUT WHEN I GOT IT HOME IT WAS A VERY SMALL EARING DEF. NOT WORTH $60.
4,Nice earrings!,"I read through the previous reviews before deciding to purchase these earrings. I am pleased with them, and think that I made a good decision. They are small -- as other reviewers have noted -- but that is what I wanted and the dimensions are reported accurately on the product page. They are also lightweight, which I believe to be a positive attribute. Overall, I find them to be a very nice, simple earring that gives a very classic look and is of very nice quality."
5,very pretty and elegant earrings,"they are beautiful, the earrings have very good brightness and are spectacular and precious. The salesman and the page of amazon are very responsible, I recommend it with the closed eyes.Thanks you..."
4,What I expected,"For the price, these are very nice and good for everyday wear. Will be giving these as a Valentine gift to my Mom."
1,"Too small, the size of pencil eraser!","They are tiny, not at all what expected! Poor quality,size for the price was a joke of an order, lesson learned!"
2,Not much gold there,"I've purchased a lot of earrings for my wife, and she likes very simple and small ones that she can wear all the time -- sleeping, yoga, running, etc. These are small diameter, which is fine, but they are not solid gold. They appear to be plated and really feel like plastic. When I first held them in my hand, I couldn't feel any weight at all, and I would be embarrassed to give them as a gift.I returned these earrings, and Amazon was great, as usual, about the free shipping and quick credit. I ended up buying a different pair from a local jeweler. They were even smaller hoops, but because they were solid gold, they felt like something substantial."
5,Absolutely Perfect!,"These little earrings were exactly what I wanted for work (to wear with scrubs and not look gaudy). They are small, but have a nice width, so they are very shiny. I also like the snap-bar closure. They'd make a nice gift for a pre-teen as they are simple but elegant and the snap bar closure makes them easy to put in with little chance of loss."
4,Fair price and good product.,"I got what I expected from these earrings. Although, I was hoping Amazon would be a little more competatively priced."
1,Rip off,"I am long time Amozon customer and this is the first time I feel flat out ripped off. These earrings are tiny - not small - tiny. When the package first arrived, I truly thought that they forgot to ship the earrings. I couldn't find them in the pouch they were sent in."
2,keeping but would not recommend,"It may be my mistake that I did not see the size, but width was fine but size of hoop was tiny."
3,Too small,"I bought these earrings thinking they would be the same size as a normal wedding band. But they ended up being too ""fat"" and too small in diameter. The quality is good though, and the packaging and box were impecable."
2,Earring Size,"The photo showing these earrings indicated 1 inch (I assumed in diameter) but apparently I mistook this after looking again at the diagram.. My mistake!! They are only 1/2"" in diameter - and that is NOT what I wanted. So I will return them for credit to my account. They are beautiful but just too small, and I will look for a larger size."
3,Oops!,"I got it wrong! Despite my,I thought, correct sizing, these ear rings are about half the size I wanted. They are very nice, but very small, more the size of a dime than quarter. I was trying to replace a set I'd gotten at Amazon and loved. Now I'll need to try again. Measure twice, cut once!"
5,She loved 'em!,Got these for my wife and they are perfect. Nice quality and she can wear them with casual dress or dressing up even nicer.
3,Nice lens,"Use this, only if you're shooting something larger than a house. The regular setting on the camera will take wide shots nicely. Keep in mind, this lens is a monster! It has it's own bag & covers that come with it, a nice feature. Also, set your camera to W when you use this lens. It helps.Depending on your other lenses & covers/filters, you can screw this right on & use it in combination. A very sturdy lens, almost weighs as much as the camera. Have wipes handy! Also, don't extend the camera's lens with this thing on, for long. You should support the extended lens, when shooting up, as the weight will push the camera's lens back down. So remote shooting up, is out unless it's a quick shot.Other wide angles (with steps) will fit, but they have to be adjusted first."
5,Here's a find,"For fans of world music, this might interest you. M'Butu is a Ga. percussionist influenced by African rhythms who has played with the Derek Trucks Band and the Aquarium Rescue Unit. Here he teams with Argentinian singer Graciela Lopez with help from Oteil Burbridge and his brother Kofi, Chuck Leavell, Jimmy Hering, Jeff Sipe and many others. It's an eclectic set with most songs in Spanish and a strong percussion sound led by M'Butu. Definitely not a Top 40 (or a Top 400 sound for that metter) but very interesting and different.A solid 4.5 Stars."
5,watch the north wind rise,"This is an early sample of the style that evolved out of Airplane. Tremendous . If you can get it Get Double Dose from 1977. Jorma is one of the heavies of blues, acoustic or hard .. He doesn't get his due though he knows the blues. Especially fine wining boy and hesitation"
4,A Positive Step Back,"Born in hotel rooms after laying down the lightning and the thunder for the Jefferson Airplane; Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Cassidy return to their roots with Hot Tuna. Recorded at a coffee house, this album has the feel of the classic blues of the early 60s, ESPECIALLY Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry's LIVE AT THE 2ND FRET.Kauakonen and Cassidy (with harmonica player WIll Scarlett) made a siginficant step tword their future by forming this side group. Kaukonen shows off a love for the blues of the Rev Gary Davis and Jelly Roll Morton and Cassidy contributes his always awesome bass work, with Scarlett sliding in and out with them.For lovers of the blues who aren't absolute PURISTS, this is a great set. Anyone interested in the influences of the California rock bands of the late 60s/early 70s should pick this up."
5,Memories,Was I really suppose to remember all the music? Excellent.Youth and memory wasted (on the young) or was that Neil?
4,"Good, really good...","Really strong, acoustic-oriented blues from Jefferson Airplane's lead guitarist and bass player. I only rated it ""4"" because my taste runs more toward a ""heavier"" sound which you can find on their later efforts. Bottom line: if you are a fan of the blues, a fan of acoustic-based rock this is a really good album..."
4,Instrumental greatness,"If Jorma could actually sing, this would be one of the most perfect blues albums of all time. His voice is just too thin to be believable as a blues singer. His guitar work, however, is wonderful!!!! Jorma plays as though he has four hands. The real star of this CD, though, is Jack Casady. What a magnificent bass player!!!! He is like a great jazz bassist. He never really intrudes on Jorma's playing, but at the same time, you can never just ignore him, either. Jack has the perfect placement of notes to add to what Jorma is doing on guitar. I know it would be impossible to do a blues album without singing, so I can't fault Jorma for trying, but the main point to listen for is the wonderful instrumental interplay between guitar and bass. If you love blues, buy this CD, put up with Jorma's weak vocals, and revel in the great instrumental work."
5,So Good,"This is one of the best albums ever released, period. Having had the pleasure of seeing Jorma and Jack live, this album captures their incredible intuitive interaction. The new, previously unreleased tracks are a great bonus. Buy it!"
5,CLASSIC,"Yellow Feveris one of Hot Tuna's electric masterpieces. This is accoustic. With this band, however, both sides of the fence are brillantStrictly speaking, you could divide Hot Tuna's blues the way all blues is divided--rural and urban. But with this band, that partially misses the mark. Even when Kaukonon and Cassidy are playing accoustic blues, it is never too rural, too down home.There playing and technique, their sense of rhythm placement, is so sophisticated, coming from psychadelic rock, even their work in this strain has an accomplished polish. This is not to knock traditional rural blues, but you'll know the second you turn this on you are not hearing a Leadbelly album.This was recorded in a club in 1970: you hear glasses dropping, the audience close to the stage. The intimacy is laced through the album, as is the duo's detailed picking and carefully improvised bass. It's all here in full detail, and makes this a master debut."
5,One of the best Hot Tuna albums you can buy!!,"Definitely, one of the best Hot Tuna albums you can buy. It's also their first album. Enjoyed the extra tracks added from the original version. I've had this on LP and CD and pretty much wore them out, so getting this edition was a necessary must!!Great price, fast processing and shipping."
1,They did say it was an business product ...,"with good features for an IT department. Your mileage may vary, but it is not really suitable for consumer use. Yes, the keyboard is surpisingly good, the screen sharp, the time to load screaming fast, and it has a good suite of features. On the other hand, for this very experienced user, it took an inordinate amount of time to get it to synchronize with the desktop or connect to AT&T Worldnet. Once connected, however, I couldn't get the unit to resolve domain names (i.e., I couldn't actually connect to the world wide web). The straw, however, was that two programs would not terminate, and NEC support confirmed that my only alternative was to remove the batteries and do a hard reset. It's a shame, and my experience may not be typical, but you're warned--don't try this at home."
3,The Brick,"This unit runs Windows CE operating system by Microsoft. Great built-in apps (Office, Excel, Access, Power Point, etc.). The keyboard is a bit cramped for speed typing.This is my least favorite PDA device (I also have the IBM-Z50, HP Jornada 680 and 728 models, Casio E-125). The NEC 900 was built mainly to be used in industrial settings. The screen is dull and somewhat washed-out.I only take this unit with me to job-sites in high-crime areas, so if I lose it, I won't care that much!Still ... It's better than a PDA with no keyboard. The screen is OK when indoors. There is a lot of Windows CE software out there (on the Internet) for free. Good for the kiddies doing their homework on the run.Better units are the Jornada 680,728 series - light, small and good screen,and the IBM Z50 its almost full-size keyboard and great IBM support."
5,Hilarious episodes!,"Both episodes are hilarious!!! ""Diane's Perfect Date"" cracks me up whenever I get the chance to watch it. Sam and Diane agreed to find each other a date... Diane found an attractive and intelligent date for Sam, but he couldn't find anyone for Diane! He spotted a guy who was so opposite of Diane, but there was so much more than to this! I love the part when they all four arrived at the bar from their date, and Shelley Long was HILARIOUS! :) Check it out!""Any Friends Of Diane""-- Diane was determined to find a companion for her friend, Rebecca Prout (played by Julia Duffy). After hearing Rebecca's detailed description on what she wanted to seek in a man, Diane immediately thought of a perfect man for her. Rebecca had someone else specific in her head--- SAM! Oh, woe is Diane! :) Again, check this out!Cheers!"
4,Could be better,"I really like these episodes; however, I personally think that these are not the ""Best of Sam and Diane."" There are surely much better episodes that could be placed under that category. I don't think that this really captures the esscence of the relationship between the two."
5,Funny!,"Cheers is a good show, one of my favorite episodes is The Homicidal Ham, Derek McGrath who played Andy was great in that famous Othello murder scene with Shelley Long (Diane)! Very funny episode! Fans of Derek McGrath may be interested to know that he is in the TV show Doc."
3,"I love Clarks, but...","I am very picky about my summer sandals/casual wear, as I spend every day in them for about 5 months out of the year. I love the way these look, so I spent the $80, but even though I still find them super cute on, and they feel great just standing, I got blisters on both feet from the back strap. I've tried ""breaking"" them in, but I keep getting blisters. I've basically had wounds on my feet since April, because I refuse to give up on them. I wish they were comfy!"
2,Would qualify for a B-movie festival,"Oh Jane, Jane...WHY did you do it? I think I know. Either 1) you had no other prospects for paying the mortgage, 2) you were you dating the director or producer at the time or 3) you owed someone a BIG favor.This ""film"" qualifies for about 1/2 a star but I gave it 2 simply due to the appearance of Jane Seymour. I only bought this to add to my JS collection. It has bad acting by Peter Weller and a dismal storyline. If that weren't bad enough, the musical score grates on you every time you hear it -- the ""music"" doesn't add to the story, it only distracts. This movie has virtually nothing going for it except Seymour's appearance. Don't buy this unless you are a BIG Seymour fan."
2,cut movie,JANE SEYMOUR has done so few nude seans that its a shame when you find one and buy it only to find out the copy you has them edited out. I checked several times with the slowest speed my dvd player could go.
1,Disappointed Dad on Dad's Day,"There are three sections in the book, and the largest is titled, ""Room for Improvement."" In this section, as the others, are quotes from children about their fathers. While the other two sections have cute, warm, uplifting quotes, this one - the largest - contains veiled compliments and outright put-downs for the kids' dads. We were hoping for a sweet, uplifting book of quotes, and instead found a mostly disappointing, bummer of a book."
2,Bit dissapointing,"To start, the packaging for this product was not in good condition. It actually looked like it had a scorch mark!Then, the product itself appears to be of a lesser quality, - not what I expected for the Bulova brand.Add to the fact that the clock requires winding before the second day.On the upside, the clock does keep time.Overall, though, this purchase is not one I would make again."
4,Back in Perfect Pitch Black,I would give this album 4.5 stars. This album maybe Cave In's second collection of demos that's been scattered online for centuries before this albums release but there's still meaning in buying this album. Some of the songs weren't released before and the old demos are polished up to a mirror shine and sound better. This album is quite refreshing after Antenna (considering a lot of fans completely left after that album and never gave the band a second chance). I can honestly say I'm a fan of Cave In...just not a fan of Antenna. This album brews a nice balance (terms of the music itself) between Until Your Heart Stops and Jupiter. It's somewhat heavy but not on the level of Beyond Hypothermia and still maintains to be catchy much like Jupiter and Tides of Tomorrow.Everyone should get this album if you're a fan of Cave In or want reassurance that this band hasn't sold out.
4,"It's not perfect...then again it's not ""jupiter""...","Honestly this is the best cave in CD ive encountered in an awefully long time. I started listening to cave in with ""beyond hypothermia"" and i've seen them change from metal to pop to ""MTVized"" and now back to what us original cave in fans admired in the first place. The CD is basically a depiction of the decade that cave in has been in business; metal songs, pop songs, and comibations. The lyrics reflect cave in's attempt at ""making it big"" and now breaking from those major recording industries and returning to (what i think is a better label) Hydra Head Records owned by Aaron Turner of ISIS and Old Man Gloom. ""The World is In your Way,"" ""Off to ruin,"" and ""Down the Drain"" are some of the best cave in songs ive heard yet. True cave in fans won't be dissapointed; but, you will still here some lengthy repetive riffs (such as Ataraxia and Trepanning) which knocks down the CD's perfect score. It's not ""jupiter"" but its pretty damn good."
3,It's pretty good...,"...except for the James Hetfield ""YEEEAAAHHH!"" vocals. Seriously. Dead ringer for the guy. Listen to tracks 2 and 3 to hear what it is i am talking about. YEEAAAHHH!"
4,Piano Masterpieces,"This is a good colloection of Floyd Crammer's piano. The CD is clear and full, and the piano is well recorded. The selection of songs, although not terribly dynamic is pure ""Floyd Crammer."" The music is very fine."
5,Classic Floyd Cramer,"I had this when it was in LP form, and it sounds just as great today as it did when I was a kid. Nobody plays a piano like Floyd Cramer did, and this is one of his best albums."
4,Enhanced Edition Review - not so enhanced on the AV front,"Yup, good book w/ 12,000 additional words (as compared to the 1st published version). My lack of a 5th star arises from the labeling of this electronic edition as ""[Kindle Edition with Audio/Video]"". The AV content is stuff like the author reading selected passages, an interview between the author & his editor, etc. Very nice. Or it would be nice except that it doesn't work on a Kindle (I am using it on the 1st generation Kindle Fire). To be fair, on the product page is some text saying""Kindle Edition with Audio/VideoAudio/Video content only available for iPads, iPhones, and iPod Touch devices."" but I think that if the AV doesn't work on a Kindle then you shouldn't be labeling as a Kindle edition with Audio/Video."
3,"Entertaining, a Comfortable Read","This was my first Neil Gaiman book. It was imaginative and refreshing. He developed numerous scenarios and a pantheon of characters--but his development was so natural that it was easy to track the moving plot and keep everyone straight. Importantly, the plot resolved nicely yet with surprise. I like his approach to science fiction and I will definitely read more of his work."
5,Gaiman at his early best,"American Gods has aged surprisingly well. For anyone wondering what the big deal is with Neil Gaiman, or who's got a thing for an irreverent story taking timeless archetypes and crashing them headlong into history, you can't do any better than American Gods."
3,Beautifully written but fragmented,"This book was beautifully written, but I just seemed too fragmented to make much sense. Maybe the concept is just over my head, but I found I didn't enjoy it. I found the characters interesting and complex, but the book seemed to lack cohesiveness. Perhaps it culminated into something that made sense at the end, but I couldn't wait that long. I opted to give it up and read something that fell more in line with the usual shape of fiction."
2,THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES...,"I have read several of Gaiman's books and been impressed by his imagination. I absolutely loved Neverwhere and wish desperately for him to write a sequel. This book however, has too much squashed between the pages, characters I don't give a hoot about, obscenities instead of dialogue, weird sex scenes. I found the book convoluted, confusing, disjointed and most of all, just plain boring."
2,Just plain boring,"I'm sorry. I don't know what other people saw in this book that I must have overlooked, but I found it a real yawn-invoking book. It's much too long and has far too many occasions where the story just meanders off into left field without really coming back. There really seems to be no point to this novel. Surely, it's interesting getting just a grain of information on numerous gods of old, but the trip is just too long and unfulfilling. When I finished the book, I put it down and muttered ""What a waste of time"" to myself.I really liked Stardust and Good Omens, but this book is nowhere near as good. It was an effort to read this, unlike most authors I enjoy (Tolkien, Terry Brooks, Pratchett, etc.)."
2,"If this is his best, I'd hate to read the rest of his books...","According to the editorial reviews, American Gods is Neil Gaiman's best and most ambitious novel yet. If that's the case, I'd hate to have to read any of his other books.I had had such high hopes for it, as it's come highly recommended to me by just about everybody, but was very disappointed. It was boring and difficult to get through. If all of Neil Gaiman's books are like this, I don't think I'll be reading any more of them."
2,More cheese than WI...,"I would have loved to give this a much higher rating. However, I was completely disappointed by the plot. Gaiman had a great idea going and could have done much better. Most of the ""twists"" turned out to taken from daytime soap operas. I guess the first red flag was when (and, trust me, I'm not giving away any of the plot here) Laura came back from the dead... And our main character was not even remotely suprised. Really now. I felt the characters were devoid of all... um... character... extremely flat. However, the idea behind the book was great. I just wish Gaiman made up his mind on wheather or not this was going to be humorous or serious (would have been much more enjoyable if he didn't try to be so serious). If you were disappointed as I was with this book, try Good Omens."
2,Not as much as a novel,"Neil Gaiman is probably one of the best plot writters for comics and graphical novels in english language. Also is a great writter and reader of tales. Disgracefully, it seems that his abilities are not yet rippe enough for a true novel.Altough ""American Gods"" has many entretaining details, and is fun, it is not really a novel, but more like the plot of a giant comic nobody ever draw. It lacks the rithm and complexity of a novel, specially one which pretends to be 300 pages long. I believe Gaiman has still to mature to be able to write this kind of works. I recommend the readers to keep adquiring his works in comics and short tales, where he is superb, until he shows refinament in his plots."
5,I know you're not supposed to do this...,"...but I had never read Gaiman before and judged this book on the cover (and, of course, the excerpt I read here). Needless to say, the cliche was wrong! Putting aside all bells and whistles, this book was wonderful. Even if you don't necessarily enjoy it, you'll find something to enjoy in this novel.I heartly recommend ""American Gods"" to anyone who enjoys the English language, as Mr. Gaiman has a wonderful command over it. The only problem with this book is finding a prominent enough space on my bookshelf for it."
3,Sometimes I feel a little underestimated...,"I'm a fan. The more I travel around the US, the more I enjoy this book. But, I also had a strong knee jerk reaction to some characters--do you know who's reading your books, Neil? How familiar do you think they are with Norse mythology? I felt like I wasn't supposed to catch on right away to who certain characters were supposed to represent, but dude--I love you, but not for your subtly."
3,Amusing,"I like his writing style and this was a fun, easy read. But there was nothing outstanding or gripping about it. It was overall just amusing."
4,What if gods still walked the earth?,"In this book Neil Gaiman explores a world in which the pre-Christian gods, not to mention all kinds of demi-gods, live in America. Most have been forgotten and live tawdry lives, eking out an existence on the margins of society. They encounter a new generation of gods of the internet and television, not to mention of cars and planes. A war between the old and the new is brewing and a man named Shadow is caught in the middle.What would it be like to be the son of a god in our own times? It is hard to relate to the experience of a mythical Greek hero like Hercules (a son of Zeus) because it seems as if he lived in a completely different, heroic world. Yet what would his experience have been if he lived in a world we can understand and relate to? Gaiman updates the concept for our times. He does so in a literarily consistent and fascinating fashion. This is a remarkable book without parallel in the genre. A must read."
5,Gaiman delivers again...,"...no surprise there. He really takes advantage of the space allotted by the novel format (as opposed to the comics, short stories, and children's books he was once more known for). This wildly ambitious book works in several ways: as a fantasy epic, as a satiric look at American culture, as the character study of a flawed but basically good man, as a portrait of a troubled relationship, as a suspense novel, and in creating its own modern mythology out of disparate elements (which do owe quite a bit to Gaiman's earlier work on Sandman, where Odin, Bast, Loki, and a number of the other characters also appear). It is a remarkably fast-paced read, with surprises popping up almost constantly, and occasionally jaw-dropping revelations. Gaiman is a master of plotting as well as characterization.I think that I can say without fear of hyperbole that this book is one of the greatest things of any kind ever created. Ever. (Okay, maybe there was some hyperbole there)."
1,ugh,"I so wish I'd read some of the reviews before wasting my time with this book. I read Good Omens and adored it -- so I thought I'd like this -- went on the recommendation of a friend (love ya J but nope). This book was so boring and in an attempt to find some redemption, for any of the characters or Gaiman, I read the whole thing. I should have quit at least the third or fourth time I muttered, ""I hate this book."" On the other hand, after reading the first chapter of Neverwhere, I'm entertained, amused and thrilled. Go figure. I am not sure how American Gods won an award."
5,Brilliant!,"Neil Gaiman is absolutely brilliant! This is only the second book I've read by him, the first being Good Omens by Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Good Omens didn't even come close to being as good as this book. Basically, the old gods from every pantheon immigrated to the United States following the people that worshipped them. As people started losing faith in these gods, the gods started becoming weaker and eventually had to start living like humans and getting jobs, etc. The old gods start feeling threatened by the new gods (the media, computers, cars, etc.) and a big battle starts brewing. I thought this was an amazing book and I look forward to reading more by Gaiman."
4,Great characters,"I love it when authors can generate rich, believable characters from the ashes of long-forgotten myths and legends. This is my first Neil Gaiman book, but it will definitely not be my last. Although, I have never been interested in mythological gods, Gaiman has placed a spark in me that may blaze into something worth researching. I recommend it."
4,All-American Fun,"This is an enjoyable book that crosses back and forth over the line between reality and ""this couldn't possibly be true...but is."" The cultural observations are astute if not acerbic and the ""gods"" with their ordinaryness and powers are excellently. The author excels in sustaining suspicion throughout the novel as we wonder if what we dare think could be true really is. This is a tale that shimmers just beneath the surface where most of the action lies.The only problem is the main character. He never becomes as real as the other characters, perhaps due to his utterly boring persona. Still, the story of Americans who just happened to be ancient gods who play scrabble, bowl and argue is captivating. The earth-shaking finale has parallels with many others - Buffy the Vampire, Mortal Combat, X-Men - all, by the way, as American as apple pie."
5,A Great Book!,"I was completely caught off guard when I picked this one up. Had no idea what I was getting into.A fantastic, journey into the mystical. Complex and very straightforward all at once. Refreshing. Gaiman shows incredible knowledge of mythology and its place in the human psych. An enjoyable journey that I didn't want to end."
3,"Good, but standard Gaiman","Gaiman is an excellent storyteller, but a curiously afflicted writer. He seems to have a single dominant thread that runs through his work, and perhaps I'm only frustrated with it because I'm not from the UK. That thread is this: his protagonist always seems to get shoved, manipulated or dragged around in the story without ever exhibiting much control. Like in this book: eventually it becomes clear that Shadow is the hero because of his remarkable capabilities, but emotionally and mentally, he remains passive, directionless and often -- whether literally or figuratively -- completely in the dark.I like Gaiman's work, and I understand how writers write themselves ""into"" their work, but I can't imagine that someone as successful and well-regarded as Neil Gaiman is as big a zero as most of his main characters seem to be."
3,It was ok.,"This was the first book I've read from this author. It was an ok story. I was hoping for a bit more out of it. I thought it was going to be more philosophical and more history with the gods. I thought Shadow was a likeable character but I thought he was poorly written. The story was a bit longer than what it needed to be. I found that there were stretches of the book that I couldn't put down, but there were stretches that I had to force myself to continue on. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying this book - this is a highly recommended book. Maybe you will find that spark that many people loved that I missed."
4,First time Neil Gaiman reader,"As the title suggests, this is the Neil Gaiman book I have read.The book was a very easy read. The writing flowed very well and when I put the book down, it left a lasting impression. The book has something to teach you, and offers several different perspectives on things you might have already known. I found myself looking on the map for a lot of the locations that were spoken about, and it made me excited to travel the Americas some day. For these reasons I give it the 4 stars.The one area that this book failed, and the reason it did not get 5 stars, was because of the small short stories that would inject themselves into the main story. The main plot progresses fairly rapidly, and then out of no where, you are looking through the eyes of 2 black slaves, or a native woman with some connection (not much) to the main story. I skimmed the book once I completed it and found that if these little stories were removed, I would consider this a much better book overall."
3,Interesting,"Although a brilliant concept, and for the most part well-written, this book fell flat. The main character is hard to get to know - Shadow's back-story is doled out in little dribs and drabs throughout the book, and the main plot (which is presumably about him) seems almost like an afterthought.It is very easy to imagine this as a television series, in fact it will probably be more successful as an hour show, each god and locale they visit would be one episode."
5,Road Side Attraction Masterpiece,"Gaiman pulls off a near perfect mixture of American road-trip, kitch, mythology, and fascinating characterization in this novel. This book is witty with a wry sensability and above all a really likeable character who just happens to be an ex-con on-the-run who really just wants to be left alone. I loved this book and can't wait to read other Gaiman novels."
4,Brilliant Prose and Premise,"American Gods by Neil Gaiman is a thrilling, thought-provoking tale of forgotten God's and their quirky existence on Earth.A long read, worth every minute, this book paints a picture of our world that is dark, delicious and delightfully wrought with deeply disturbed characters. I really enjoyed the story and writing style. Highly recommended for the dark masses."
4,Im thoroughly enjoying it so far... HOWEVER,"My copy of Neil Gaiman's American Gods (Authored Preferred Text)is missing pages 143-174. Does anyone else have this problem with the physical copy of the 10th anniversary edition?Other than that, Gaiman's world of ancient gods in rural America is a humorously dark, adventure ride that will keep you from putting the book down (unless of course, you're missing an entire section.. ugh.. off to torrent the book)"
3,Kindle Order,Immediate delivery to my Kindle. Only problem: The Amazon price charged when I ordered was a good bit more than the price indicated on Amazon when I shopped it. If I thought this was something more than a mistake I'd be seriously annoyed but it's never happened before so I will assume it was a fluke.
3,"A rambling unfocussed story, wonderfully told","So many reviews are summed up with the phrase ""a great story, wonderfully told."" I found this to be not so great a story, but so wonderfully told that it didn't stop me from reading. Too much of How The World Works is left unexplained, or contradicted by the story itself, or with a great big theological hole large enough to drive Orson Welles through. History gets mucked with for no apparent reason. Some echoes of other writers and other stories were recognizable and hence distracting (e.g., Zelazny's ""Lord of Light"" and ""Creatures of Light and Darkness,"" and Tim Powers' ""Last Call"" especially).But like I said, and worth repeating: wonderfully told. Great cast of characters, great canvas, moving myth-making."
3,"Interesting, but deeply flawed","Thre are a lot of interesting ideas presented here, but there seem to be few rules governing the world he's created. Because almost anything can happen at any time -- eg. the dead randomly spring back to life -- there is nothing at stake and it feels like a self-indulgent exercise. If you're a Gaiman fan, I recommend it, but his editor should have reined him in and helped him produce a shorter, more coherent and unified novel."
3,"Good ideas, bad characters","The characters in this book are entirely an afterthought to the setting of the book. A lot of interesting ideas come together in a so-so way, but it takes the reader too long to get there. This probably should have been a graphic novel instead."
2,Underwhelming,"I grew up on New Wave sci-fi, and have seen this type of story before. It uses characters and plots we 'know' in disguise. The pleasure from such stories comes from two places - first, the magical 'aha' moment when we unravel their identities. Next, the finale, where the author reveals new twists on a familiar archetype.Unfortunately, American Gods is bland. It lacks the crackle of Harlan Ellison, the startling brevity of Roger Zelazny, or the unsettling button-pushing of José Farmer. It felt 'done before'. I got bored and couldn't finish it."
3,"Episodic, but Good Premise","Having heard about this book for years, I was ready to be blown away. But I found the book good, not great. The premise is wonderful, and the writing is good---not flashy but smooth and effective. The book's greatest weakness was the episodic plot: a road-trip that lasts 3/4 of the novel and is fairly repetitive. I appreciated the ending, though: very thoughtful and appropriate and yet also surprising."
4,"Open your mind, and enjoy","This is my first novel by Gaiman I am a huge Sandman fan so of course I needed to venture out into some bigger works of Gaiman. This book did not disappoint in the least. I love mythology, and the thought and idea's in this book are well written, and well...thought out. Makes you do a lot of thinking while reading and wondering, I like when a book entertains and makes you think at the same time."
5,A must read,"I read American Gods in paperback a few years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I have now bought the kindle edition and read it again. It is the mark of a great story that you can read and re-read with satisfaction each time. Neil Gaiman's prose is deft and his story imaginative and the pace with which he moves his story will keep you glued to this book. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone, not only fans of the genre."
4,wierd but fun,What an imagination the author must have. Loved every minute of this. Thought provoking adventure set on awild road trip thrum little known usa
3,"Interesting story, great writing, recommended - but the ending...","Ancient gods that have long been abandoned and forgotten by their followers are living everyday lives in America. The new gods of technology have risen to power. A battle is coming unbeknownst to the masses, and an ex-con named Shadow finds himself in a world he didn't know existed.American Gods is an original idea backed up with excellent storytelling from the author. The main story branches off into several different directions without losing its focus. The only problem - the ending.Despite the strong narrative in the first two-thirds of the book, the ending is less interesting than the original premise. American Gods is still recommended as a good read."
5,My kind of humor,"I really enjoy Neil's dark sense of humor. I've read most of his works and American Gods is no exception, it is most assuredly good fantasy, but with a great satirical feel to it that kept me going strong to the very end. Highly recommended."
4,My intro to Gaiman and I loved it,"I really love this book. It stuck with me, I've re-read it several dozen times and every time it just amazes me how much I enjoy it. This is the first book I read by Neil Gaiman and since I read it I've read almost everything else he's written. I find this book to be engaging and interesting. I find the characters to be interesting and well rounded. The only thing I don't like is the ending, it was a bit of a letdown, the first time I read the book I was seriously disappointed, however since re-reading it I find it less irritating. It's a good read."
1,The Domino's pizza of literature,"Large, apparently full of interesting bits, but ultimately completely unsatisfying. I was left with the feeling that I shouldn't have bothered, and would ultimately regret my decision to indulge.An enormous disappointment after Gaiman's previous excellent ""Neverwhere""Avoid"
2,The jacket copy is the high point,"Yes, I'll admit I got suckered in by the jacket copy. That and Gaiman co-wrote ""Good Omens"" (with Terry Pratchett) which I enjoyed a ton.But, the great premise of an American mythology personified and come to life is undermined by truly disturbing sexual and violent content (no spoilers here though). The sex and violence seemed to only be in here to shock, not to tell a story. I don't think I'm a prude but there are some things I just don't want to read about and unfortunately, this book contained them. Which probably explained by it achieved best-seller status. Sometimes, it's nice not to be in the norm.Why 2 stars then? The beginning of the book isn't awful, and there are a few points where the author's excellent style overcomes the pathetic attempt at a story."
2,Good and bad,"Neil Gaiman has an original and interesting writing style, but this book meanders around. The pay off is not there. It's not worth the ride. Anti-climatic. Do not waste your time."
5,"Sandman was only the beginning, Gaiman rocks","Anyone who is familiar with Neil Gaiman's ultra-literate Sandman series won't be surprised at the Beat-Poet-ish (Allen Ginsberg, perhaps) riffs, and the Biblical sweep of the Bhagavad-Gita soulful-meditation-on-truth Wagner-like operatic arias of prose in American Gods.To sum up the plot does the book an injustice. It is an apocalyptic fantasy pitting the old gods against the gods of the Digital Age. It is a tale of redemption (or is it?) for the Everyman hero, Shadow, as well as for America. It takes us through many mythologies such as Native American (Don't know Wisakedjak? You will!), Norse (The villain, Mr. Wednesday, is purportedly Wotan, as in Odin, a favorite in Gaiman's Sandman odysseys), and modern pseudo-mythologies such as media, Internet and television.And although you may be wondering at page 400 where it's going, just let yourself get lost in Gaiman's playful, emotional prose and his American Gods."
1,American Junk,"From everything I have read, and everyone I have spoken to, it seems that I am one of the few people on the planet who did not enjoy this book. I am fan of Neil Gaiman, especially of his graphic novels, and of other works, including Neverwhere and Stardust. I enjoy darker-themed fiction.In addition to dark, however, I found this work to be dingy, depressing, and even occasionally disgusting. I had to force myself to continue on, and I simply found little to nothing redeemable in the experience.Others have described it as fascinating, haunting, and surreal. For me, it simply fell flat. There was no magic in the prose, and it felt sloppy, chopped up, and not as original as the back cover would lead one to believe. I didn't find a single character compelling enough to care about through the end of the book, or even to remember once I'd closed it.My recommendation on this one? Skip it."
4,the deities and the story makes American Gods enjoyable,"The main reason I enjoyed American Gods was that it's about these evil, good, and selfish beings deciding to wage a war on their enemies; the gods says it will be a bloodbath and I won't reveal too much on what happends in the end. The best parts are when Shadow spends time with the gods, thier conversations and what particular comments they have to say about other gods, about humans, technology, tradition, and other stuff. There a mix of horror and adventure, alot of dreams from the main character, and also an important murder as well."
4,A fun read; Good times,"As always the characters are what drive the story, and it was interesting enough to keep me reading with every free moment. As always, I love Gaiman's attention to the little details of mythology and history, and his compelling characters. However, you can tell what's coming down the road through the whole book if you've read any of his other work. It's worth the read though."
2,American Gods,"I actually hated this book, although I did read it all the way through. Gaiman seems like a Stephen King wannabe without the sense of humor."
2,"So,so.","Well, although I know this book has been very popular, it was not very interesting to me, and I stopped reading in the middle. The places, and the characters in the book are in my opnion not very Neil-geiman, and less creative compared to his other publications."
2,gaiman = overrated,"I'm not sure what I expected when I picked up this book, but after all the ranting and slavering from gaiman fans, I at least expected it to be entertaining and possibly interesting. I thought that I didn't have unreasonable expectations for this novel, but sadly they were too high for the experience.Let me put it in perspective for you and save you a few hundred pages of boredom:- characters superficial, non-interesting, and only rarely had something clever to say.- a lot of gradual buildup to go nowhere. where is my act III, mister gaiman?seriously. if you're looking for some gothy angsty gods and depressed misanthrope protagonists, go read some buffy the vampire slayer fan fiction or something and save yourself the cover price. This book doesn't have any surprises in it, but does have a few places in the country that fans of the author can road trip to and fornicate on. That's the silver lining to this snoozefest."
3,There's a god for Everything,"In this novel there is a god for just about anything, if you can think of it, it exists. The protagonist ends up between a confrontation between the gods waning in power and those waxing in power or the newly-pseudo-omnipotent. The travelogue style of the book is really what makes this an interesting read. You feel like you are in a cross country adventure. In the country of Estonia, this book has been translated into the language of Estonian. If you would like an idea what the novel is like, peruse pages 42 to 44. This is an unusual and an erotic part of the book, that although the rest is not quite as titillating, gives a good sense of its style."
1,Awful Mess in Desperate Need of Editing,"An interesting concept that might have held up for a short story, but was dreadful as a novel. Repeatedly out of control side tracks into exposition that is not terribly important. Slowly the pieces fit together around page 500. If I had not been on vacation, I would have given up on it long before. I now regret wasting the time I did spend on it. I want those hours back. I also want the editor who greenlighted this mess fired. This desperately needs editing down to 250pp. The author's ego (and lack of restraint by editors) left the barn long ago. Would that I could select half a star for this one."
2,I guess I wasn't all that impressed,"If you've read Douglas Adams' The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul, you already know the general ideas of this book. I was distubed by the similarity--Norse gods, bitter because of their human-imposed immortality, bringing a mortal into their own dimension, etc. I got a couple of laughs out of American Gods, and I suppose it was worth the time spent reading it, but it was nothing exciting. I enjoyed Good Omens and absolutely adore the Sandman series, and was disappointed by this attempt."
1,Total crap,"I can't get why some of my friends liked this clumsy mechanical story. Oh well, to each his own. I'll just remain never to buy anything by this author again."
2,Despite interesting characters the story goes nowhere.,"The man has a talent for creative supernatural characters, but apparently no skill at all at wrapping up his vague, wandering storyline. Don't read this unless a major fan of Gaiman."
2,Dull,Im not sure why this book received high ratings. It was meandering and disjointed. The characters were under developed and their motivations were vague - vague even for folks who enjoy classic literature and ancient human beliefs.
5,Brilliant,"A brilliant work of literature, that should be read by anyone with a brain and a sense of humor. Grab and go reading you don't want to put down."
2,boring pointless book,This novel has an interesting premise but it is weakly executed. The characters and situations were so boring and uncompelling that I had trouble continuing with the book at times.Even his prose lacked vitality.The basic structure of new gods challenging old gods is interesting but except for a few intermittently scattered passages the book is awful.
1,awful,I saw that this book was an award winner and gave it a try. It was terrible. The premise was stupid and never made any sense. Characters were lame. Awful!
1,Cheaper at Vostco,"I love my iPad and the Kindle app. However, stop ripping us off. I just saw this book at Costco, in print which required paper, ink, labor, transportation, stocking and display for LESS MONEY.Costco got my money instead of Amazon today."
1,aweful,"It's an aweful boring story that doesn't make sence at all, I readed the first 100 pages and had to put the book down cause I couldn't handle all the crap.I waisted my money and time."
1,waste of time,"this book is just terrible, and i regret that i even spent a moment of my time and money for this nonsense. first of all there was no plot and evrything was vague. i was kept wondering what the real story was wether it was about the gods, about the main character shadow or laura who rose from the dead. the writer did not seem to know how to connect these characters together and just went from scene to scene which were irrelevant. i don't know what the hoopla is all about this author and i'm purely disappointed. after reading the reviews on the first page of the book i expected to at least enjoy the story but sad to say this is a terrible book."
3,"Good Book, Stupid Amazon","Why Amazon, who makes an Android based tablet, would release an iPad only version of the enhanced edition is beyond me, however, that is exactly what they have done here.Good news for Android users though is that the Google Play store is currently selling an Enhanced Edition, that of course does work with Android, for the same price.Though this Android supporting edition does make one wonder about Amazon having an ipad only version all the more."
4,faded gods but wonderful zombie wife,"Enjoyed the short stories scattered among the chapters more than the main story. Over all atmosphere was rather depressing. The once-powerful but diminished gods were as sad as the tawdry decaying tourist attractions. Very well written, but I was expecting something lighter.Went back and looked up some details I wanted to describe to a friend. Got hooked and read quite a lot over. Enjoying more the 2nd time. Love the zombie wife!"
4,"good start, weak finish","I liked the premise of this book and got caught up in it pretty quickly. I think things got lost toward the end. Actually there really wasn't an ending, the promised great confrontation which seemed to be such a central theme never took place. I guess even the author realized that the outcome would have been too one sided, but still even lost causes can be somehow emotionally satisfying, sort of like the elves leaving middle earth in Lord of the Rings. I wish I could write, I would rewrite the ending."
3,Interesting but not Neil's best,"American Gods is a dense work, a compendium of mythology both past and present. It was not as accessible as his other books, specifically ""The Neverwhere"" nad ""Good Omens"" and not as enjoyable. The tone of this novel is much darker and I miss the humor of his previous works. Still it is an interesting read and I guess it may work better if the reader had solid background in Norse, Slavic, Egyptian, etc mythology, which I do not."
3,I had trouble picking it up...even when I wanted to,The book gets off to a good start introducing a very cool idea and some pretty cool characters. The problem is that for the bulk of the book nothing much happens to them. There is little character development and the plot drags on at an awful pace. I found my self liking this book in theory but not in actuality. Read it if you want to but be prepared not to like it as much as you want to.
3,I was actually disappointed,"This is not Neil Gaiman's best. That does not mean it is bad - quite the contrary, it is pretty good. I just got the feeling when I read it that after the well-deserved success of Neverwhere he felt he had to write something similar for the US market. Neverwhere dealing with London, UK.It was kind of obvious to me that he is not as familiar with the mystic and magic of the US as he is of London.The American Gods of the book are surprisingly poorly developed, and he chooses Odin as one of the main protagonists, which gives a bit of a tired feeling to me. On the other hand, the description of the restless wife and the protected American small-town are truly chilling and up there with his best."
4,So close to perfect,"It was difficult to not give this book 5 stars as I really enjoyed it and had trouble putting it down when I had to. The idea is a very original conception and I liked the main character and how he dealt with all the strange things that are happening. The imperfections are that its too long and wanders off story from time to time, and most importantly for me was the intimation for hundreds of pages that a big battle was brewing and then the ending instead was a pastiche of too many different elements and just kind of petered out. All in all though, a great read."
4,Great Book For Gaiman Fans and Mythology Buffs,"Based on plot, characterization, and overall writing style I think most fantasy lovers would enjoy this book. However, to truly appreciate it, I think it helps if one is already a Gaiman fan and/or a mythology buff. That's what the book essentially is, a story about how mythologies evolve and the gods (who make up most of the characters) along with them. The gods haven't vanished but merely changed with the times. Not for everybody but I reallly liked it."
3,Tie it all together,"Good book, interesting idea, wasn't a huge fan of the ending. Wish the author would have explained his intentions for plots and motifs more directly. Curious as to why he picked certain god characters over others, what was the significance etc. Overall, I was disappointed and think this book was way too hyped up, possibly because people just coo over his work like Stephen Kings. If I had to directly speak to Gaiman, I would say ""tie it all together more directly"". Just give us some straight forward inner thoughts about what it all means to you."
3,Meh - apparently gods come and go,"Expecting awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping insights and revelations - not this time. Story was somewhat bleak, it could have taken place in a padded room. Perhaps, some lunatic having an identity crisis and possessing limited imagination. All that I got out of this was that people's priorities change from generation to generation. For me, it also didn't make sense to ascribe deities to things people find common to their surroundings. Does the mechanical pencil god really have to take it out on the wooden pencil god?!"
5,Awesome book!,Loved it so much I read 2 more books by Gaiman right away. What happens to gods we no longer worship? Explore the possibilities in this book.
5,It'll make ya think,I loved this book. Definitely will be one of those that I read again and again and will learn something new each time.
1,boring,I found this boring. I forced myself to keep reading hoping it would get interesting until I could not take it anymore.
1,How could this book win the Hugo?,This book was waste of time. I read the first 210 pages and felt cheated. I kept waiting for the plot to develop and it never came close. How in the world did it win the Hugo? I may never read another Hugo winner.
1,Good writer/Bad book,"I picked this book up because I enjoyed Gaiman's Neverwhere.I had expected a book that was about how America (US) is run... or might be run. Being that he titled his book with two very important words I thought that this would be a book with an important feel to it.Instead... American Gods is a book that seems to be made up of Gaiman's nightmares, nightmares that no one but his therapist should be exposed to.The title misleads. These are two words (American and God) that are held dear to many. This book is NOT about America and is NOT about Gods. Rather, it takes place in America and IS about nightmares.I will ask Neil Gaiman to please warn us somewhere on the book about what it IS actually about.I threw my copy away. For anyone considering buying this book: I strongly advise against it."
1,"Bad, Bad Bad!!!","I have never read Niel Gaiman before picking up this book. I do not plan to read him again. The entire plot is pointless, and absurd. The old gods are envious of the new gods. Who cares! If you like to waste time reading bad books then by all means pick it up, otherwise don't."
1,Weird Crap,"Starts off with a weird sex scene and morphs into a collection of weird stories. Got 2/3rds through it and trashed it. What a waste of time. I am reading ""State of Fear"" br Micheal Critchen. Much better read. Some people seem to like artsy crap just because it offends people. Why?Waste of money - as I tried an author I was not familiar with, which is good to do. But not Neil Gai man again."
3,An okay entertainment.,"This is a pretty good post-modern gothic potboiler. The premise is that the ancient gods of diverse mythologies have survived and are roaming the earth in a tawdry underground seeking to re-emerge. This was a competent execution of low-key supernatural subject matter, and provided an agreeable mix of entertainment and thoughtfulness."
2,Rubbish,I read this book because both my sister in law and my nephew raved about it but I've never been so bored in my life. Lot of movement in the book but nothing happens and in the end you feel as if you've just wasted your time. There are better books out there.
1,Waste of paper,"I am sorry that I wasted as much time as I did with this pretentious, rambling, uninteresting, pseudomyhtologic ""novel"". I found myslef bored most of the times. I couldn't wait for bad things to happen to everyone in the book. And nothing really bad happened becasue none of the characters were believable enough to make me care. Good cure for insonmnia. Otherwise totally poorly spent hard earned money."
2,Probably as great as everyone says,"Neil Gaiman is a wordsmith. I have thoroughly enjoyed his books written 'for all ages'. However, I am very uncomfortable with some 'adult' themes. I couldn't get past the 'eff...' words and some explicit sexual descriptions. I had to stop reading; hence, only two stars."
2,nothing new,"This book was certainly a page-turner, but it was nothing new and left me feeling dissatisfied. The basic idea of competing gods with alternate ""realities"" like the ""backstage"" idea of this book comes straight from Heinlein's ""Job: A Comedy of Justice."" This book would be good for folks who have not read much science fiction, because then they wouldn't know that it wasn't recycled. I'm very surprised that it won a Hugo."
4,"A little too terrestrial, but it gets better","During the early chapters, I was a little bored by all the descriptions of who was drinking what sort of tea and even further descriptions by the tea coming out later. However, the book does have Neil Gaiman's trademark wit, and it does (eventually) build up to a very satisfying conclusion."
3,A somewhat disturbing book...,"This book disturbed me. I guess, in part, that's what the author had in mind. It had a very dreamlike quality. Characters seemed to come and go, and at many times with no reason. I was not familiar enough with many of the mythological characters in the book, and many times I felt like there were inside jokes that I was not getting that I would understand if I knew more about world mythologies."
4,Horrific and beautiful,"Shadow is released after three years in prison, only to find that his wife has died in a car accident. On his way to the funeral, he meets a man who calls himself Wednesday and offers him employment. Shadow, his life shattered, accepts.This brings him into an ever more mysterious world, for Wednesday turns out to be one of the old gods in the New World. There is a battle coming between them and the new gods, the gods of the Internet and the television, and Wednesday is endeavoring to rally his side for this armageddon, with Shadow's help. Caught up in this conflict and being played as a pawn by both sides, Shadow tries to figure out right and wrong, and what his role should be-as contrasted with what Wednesday and the others want it to be.Saying much more would be giving too much away (and I may have gone too far already). Gaiman evokes this world with superb craftsmanship and skill, creating images that are sometimes horrific and sometimes hauntingly beautiful."
2,"Yeah, it's bad.","Just thought I would throw my lot in with the negative reviews here. I read constantly, and can probably count on two hands the books I started but never finished. American Gods finds a place on that prestigous list. As others have noted, the main character is unrealistic and poorly developed, the storyline wanders, events lack punch, the personification of the gods seem inappropriate. I found the little back-story exerpts of old gods out of place and awkward. And after reading that the ending is a let-down, the only good thing about this book is that I didn't waste the time finishing it."
2,Torture,"I don't get it. After reading and re-reading Neverwhere(one of my all time favorites) I anxiously looked forward to Gods. What a disappointment. I forced myself to finish it, figuring it would soon pick up a bit. Never did. Too cute, too convoluted, basically unreadable. Can't wait to get to something more interesting (although The Pennysaver would be) after wasting 2 weeks."
1,Waste of time.,"I keep reading about how great Neil Gaiman is, and he's especially revered by some of my favorite authors (Patrick Rothfuss, for one). This was the first Gaiman book I've read, and it was terrible. Too weird, and his writing style is too often so ambiguous and intentionally vague with it's descriptions that I had a hard time understanding what was going on. I'm no dummy...I have advanced degrees and a high IQ...but I couldn't get a firm grasp on what was happening through most of the book. Just a big waste of time. I'll stick with Rothfuss, Hobb, Redick, etc. To each his own, I guess, but I just don't get it."
3,Silly Season Stuff,"The rating is for the yarn spinning skill of the author, not the substance of the book.Shadow, the protagonist, is about as unflappable a character as may be conceiuved. The ill-defined thesis that American technology has somehow created a new race of gods inimical to the ancient pantheons of the human races is absurd, and the idea that the( immortal gods (the very essence of divinity) can be destroyed by the lack of mortal worship or the enmity of new techie gods is nonsense and patently disrespectful to the gods and their role in the civilization of mankind. Gaiman is a competent wordsmith with a knack for suspense, but there is no substance here."
3,Against Some Grain,"Thought provoking modern fantasy, but a bit against my grain. Times change, people change, nothing remains the same...not even gods.The character of Shadow is well done, with traits that make the reader like him regardless of his past, present or choices.There is a bit of shifting from time periods and I questioned as I read whether some of them were truly necessary for the story. Overall this was a good read, though not a title I would purchase for my personal shelf."
2,Goes nowhere,"Starts off intriguingly, then proceeds to go nowhere. The ""plot"" is nonexistent, as the dull, lifeless main character goes from one random episode to next with no sense of progression or momentum. There was a pretty good story in there somewhere. I had been wanting to read this for years, but was disappointed. Lost interest around page 150 or so. Next..."
2,A real slog,"Gaiman is a good, original writer, but this novel was a huge let down. Meandering,slow and fairly pointless as far as I'm concerned, with odd interludes that add nothing to the story. I suppose they are intended to add some kind of epic scope, but the main character is so frustratingly passive throughout that I had to really push myself to finish it, and then was sorry I'd wasted the effort."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have found this book a colossal puzzle, as I could not understand clearly what was the core idea of the author, in terms of the fight between the old Gods against the new Gods as well as the message one should understand from the epilogue of the book. On the other hand, the story telling is superb, in the pages related to ""Coming to America"" (events, times and characters of the ancient tribes crossing the strait of Bering, the African slaves era and the first settlers of the pre-independence times, that constitute key parts of the origin of the United States, Excellent are also the chapters about the opportunities and misfortunes the main character (Shadow) experiences and the characters he meets during his trip across rural towns in the Northeastern US."
3,"Good, but a little simple and obvious","The story-telling is good, and the characters are well developed. The imagery is well done, and you get a good feeling for the story and settings. I found myself a little disappointed, however, that the plot didn't go anywhere more interesting. The climax was so predictable that I found myself waiting for the next twist, but there wasn't one. A fun read, but it doesn't make a huge impression."
5,Wow,"I can't believe I missed this when it was new! Really enjoyed a new perspective on old myths related in modern era. Plenty of 'things that make you go, hmmmm'."
3,Confusing at times,"OK, waiting to see what HBO does with a tv show. Would like to see a sequel to find out what happens to Shadow."
3,Interesting,I have heard that this book was groundbreaking. I'm not sure about that but I found it to be interesting. Overall I liked the story but have found it to be largely forgettable.
4,"An engaging, satisfying read","After Coraline and Stardust, I was prepared to like American Gods and was not disappointed -- a roller coaster ride of a read that left me wanting to go again. It was also the first full-length book I'd read on my Kindle -- a good experience all around. I'm now a confirmed Gaiman fan ... and Kindle reader."
3,"""enhanced"" for whom?","I'm not going to bother reviewing the book, as there are many great reviews here and elsewhere. I'll also admit that $3.99 is a steal even for the original. I will warn those interested in watching the videos that were supposed to be part of the enhanced version, that it appears to have very little support. I could not view them on my transformer prime or my pc, which are both top of the line technology. I can only assume they ONLY work on actual kindle devices? this sort of thing should be made clear, and I won't be buying another ""enhanced"" book for kindle until it is."
4,"A mythical, modern, Odyssey","Very good read. It could have lost about 50-75 pages to get rid of the tedious parts in the middle (I bought the version with the author's preferred texts) but all in all it was a good book. Symbolism, mysticism, magic, life/death, netherworld, pain, suffering, longing, etc - it's all in this book."
4,"Quick, easy, and entertaining.","I've been meaning to read this for a while now and finally decided to pick up/download a copy. I'm not going to be disingenuous and say it was the greatest book I've ever read, but Gaiman has an excellent writing style that compelled me to keep reading through the very end. I tend to read a little faster than the average person might so I ripped through this in about 5 days.For an entertainment to value ratio I have to say that American Gods delivers. I recommend you pick up a copy today.-Kelley"
3,Rich writing... doesn't deliver,"American Gods is a story of an ex-convict who gets recruited into a war between ficticious Gods; those of the old traditional world and those of the new tech world. Confusing story line ensues.I really enjoyed Gaiman's writing style... quite rich and descriptive. But, I realized about halfway into this book that I had no idea where it was going. Many little diversions from the main story line were quite entertaining, and I was looking forward to them all coming together in the end. But, they never really do. It felt like reading creative rambling. Or, listening to a long, intricate joke that has a weak punch line.I thought about the whole book after reading it and really didn't see the the whole god/american culture battle message as very profound. I was left yearning to know more about this other realm but it is really never revealed."
1,Poor imitation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mikhail Bulgakov,"I gave up on this book after reading 21 percent of it (according to my Kindle.) One Hundred Years of Solitude and The Master and Margarita it is not. It doesn't even measure up to Isabel Allende's House of Spirits, plodding along as it does, never rising to the fantastic, no matter how hard the author seems to try. In every sentence you can see the will doing the work of the imagination."
5,The most amazing book I ever read,All I can say is that I truly loved this book. I picked up and could not put it down.
4,Imaginative,"Gaimen is progressing as an author very nicely. Where he lacks in style he more than makes up for with an imaginative storyline and interesting characters. Not a classic in literature, but a very entertaining and fun read. I would recommend it anyone interested in suspending reality for a while."
4,he is one helluva storyteller! :),"the book will take you away whether you want to be taken or not. it reads like a dream.... it feels like being swept out to sea by a strong undercurrent, and you know yer supposed to be dead but you remain alive under water by some miracle and you get to see a whole different world pass before your eyes.... finally the sun comes up and yer allowed to surface.... and you want to drown yourself again but you know it's over and you're changed and it would be difficult to go back. it's the saddest moment in your life but you take a deep breath and smile. the only thing is, i thought the ending didn't quite live up to all that build up.... but read it!"
2,Didn't Care for It,"I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't get into it. With so many cliches on the shelves, I was saddened that by page 50 I was bored with American Gods. Give it a try, you might like it. Not my style, though."
5,Buy it now!,"I think people that write reviews are incredibly vain. :)This was one of the best books I have ever read. I now know why people line up in droves to meet him.But, as they say, there is no accounting for taste. I like to read the one star reviews for entertainment. I could only get part way thru most of them tho... blah blah blah... and got a headache before I could finish them. I don't think I have ever hated a book so much that I would waste time writing a bad review of it. Wait a second, I forgot about the Wheel of Time series. zzzzzz is that mess finished yet?This was a great idea for a book that I thought I was incredibly entertaining and engaging. I loved the little short stories intertwined into the main story also. I will be reading it again and I look forward to reading more of his work."
2,Reads Like a First Draft,"This book is derivative and meandering. The idea that human belief literally creates and sustains deities is not original. Gaiman's uses this idea in an ambitious attempt to write a fantasy novel that is also a detailed commentary on the role of belief and values in American life. While he deserves credit for trying hard, this book is not very succesful. The quality of writing, including plotting, characterization, and satire, is mediocre. Gaiman's social commentary is conventional. The idea is good and with considerable editing and rewriting, this could have been a decent book."
2,No offense but...,"This book was boring. I expected a little bit more from the author of Neverwhere and Coraline.Gaimon is a master of creating colorful and unsettling characters, and in that respect he does not disappoint. Certin scenes and images from the book last long after the plot fades. But overall, I found it a chore to see this book through to the end. The story was plodding at times, and I just didn't connect with Shadow enough to care about what happened to him.Maybe it's because I just finished reading the Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card and the Golden Compass Series by Philip Pullman, two of the best series ever written(!), but I couldn't help but feel that this was mere pulp fiction, and that I could have spent my free time with something a bit more satisfying."
3,"Great content, mediocre book quality.",I love this book. I read it twice (from the library) before I broke down and bough the book.The paperback edition uses poor quality paper. I paid extra for the paperback (vs. mass market paperback) expecting the kind of quality that I've seen with other trade paperbacks. I'm very disappointed! Text from the reverse of a page is clearly visible and you can even see text from the next page.It isn't the publisher's fault (I assume) but the cover is noticeably damaged (rough edges).This text refers to the following edition of the book:American Gods: A Novel
5,"Very enjoyable, a new twist on some old concepts.",Neil Gaiman takes a subject matter that is all but used up and puts a fresh perspective on it. Very well done and thought provoking.
5,One of my favorite's,"A friend at work suggested this book as I have read the Sandman collection. This book is perfect. I couldn't stop reading it although did guess right about the lake. It wasn't a book with a catch which made the story even more beautiful, until I realized at the end there was one, much like Fight Club, the writer allows the story to tell itself, not relying on tactics used by so many authors. The story of Shadow entralled me. His name actually has a point to it, unlike so many other authors who used that name for a character Unlike Sandman which conveyed it's message with pictures and art work and brilliant storytelling (see the kindly ones and Dreams face when he makes his fateful decision)American Gods used it's symbolic energy and tour of American countryside as way of taking a physical and spiritual journey which showed fantasy as a realistic portrayel of life."
5,One of the better books I have read..........,"This book will not disappoint, I great novel overall. As in most of Neil Gaiman's novel He doesnt give everything up until the end. (I hate reading a novel and know the ending by chapter 4) Some aspects were completely hidden until the end. If you liked neverwhere you will love this! Very addictive, I wanted to finish it just so I could move on with my life. Definately a book you wont put down!!!!!!"
2,Lost me...,"I thoroughly enjoyed Anansi Boys and Neverwhere, so I was really looking forward to American Gods because I knew so many people that looooved this book. When I finished the first chapter, I was sure I'd be one of them. But by the time I got halfway through, I felt like I was still trying to figure out where the story was going. There were too many scenes that didn't seem all that relevant to the plot. This one just didn't grab me like his others.I know many people value a strong literary voice; I'm not one of them. Gaiman really seemed to capture a nice balance between the literary arts and the pace of unfolding a plot with Anansi Boys and Neverwhere, but I felt American Gods tipped over on the literary side this time."
4,more?!,"I really enjoyed this book. I wish Gaiman wrote more like this. Or maybe I am biased because I have lived in several parts of the Midwest and knew many of the places that Shadow went to? But I doubt that's what I liked about this great novel.I ""read"" this as an audiobook which really brought the action to life. I ended the book with the feeling that I not only wanted a sequel, but that I wanted a series of books with the very original ideas from this book to never end."
3,"Interesting, But No Real Substance","Interesting premise but the ultimate payout is rather lacking in terms of a creative story ending or a literary message/moral. The idea of mythological gods and their prodigy being alive today (the premise is actually borrowed from a Douglas Adams novel - albeit in a different genre) draws the reader into the story in a compelling fashion. The characters are a bit stereotypical and two dimensional, but this does not stop the reader from wanting to move along at a fast clip given the premise and the first half of the plot.SPOILER ALERT for below passageBut at the end of the day, the war between the gods and the resurrection of the main character are lackluster. The war itself (and much of the build up to the war) lacks excitement and the resurrection storyline seems to lack purpose or insight.This is an OK novel, but nothing more."
5,"Brilliantly written, a real page turner.","I've only recently discovered Neil Gaiman but I think he is one of my favorite authors. His prose is spectacular, his characters are so believable even though its a Si-Fi, Horror, Fantasy book. This is now a must read as far as I am concerned."
4,Amazing Story Telling,"No point in writing a plot synopsis on this one, thats all over the product page anyway. What I will tell you is that Neil Gaiman spins an amazing tale here. It's fun and and unique. I really enjoyed this book and the characters, although I did feel that the new gods really didn't receive enough of the story to make them feel relevant, although the plot twist at the end is not something that i expected. Although the book drags on a bit, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great story."
5,Well done!,"This was one of the best pieces of writing that I've come across in a while. I loved it while reading it, and I still think about it from time to time. I even learned a thing or two. The theme between new and old is a bit cliche, perhaps, but the story line, the character development, the plot twists, and the ending are all unique. This is one you should read."
1,NOTHING HAPPENS,BORING.Huge build up about a war amongst Gods...Incessant and irrelevant descriptions...No real demonstrations of Godly Power (or any action for that matter)...Pointless acid-trip dream sequences...The War itself... less than 2 pages.Gaiman managed to make a war uneventful.A concept that should have been action packed and epic...Gives a novella's worth of substance.-Couldve been told in 30 pages
1,Just not for me,I wanted to read a science fiction book. I selected it based upon awards it had won. I enjoyed the first part of the book but somewhere around 200 pages i started losing interest. I hate to say this but at 400 pages i said i give up. I had no desire to finish it and i was just wasting my time trying to complete it. It just kept going and going and nothing to make me want to continue. I feel a huge weight has been taken off me now that i decided to give up on it. This book was a total bore after about halfway. Dont let it torture you onto reading it. And i really wanted to like it.
4,Good Book - Great Writer,"Fantasy and Horror readers have a non-formulaic writer with a limitless imagination.This book is fast paced and humorous as is all of Neil Gaiman's writing. Much darker than The Annansi Boys, which also deals with gods. American Gods introduces enough new and interesting characters to give this writer fodder for many years to come.I'll tell you what I tell my family and friends. Buy this book. Buy all of Neil Gaiman's books. His work is a breath of fresh air. Also watch for his many published short stories."
1,boring nonsense,A fat road novel that goes nowhere fast. How could this awful book have won the Hugo?
1,If you didn't like this book ...,"... but liked the idea that the ancient gods have survived in a somewhat powerless state, then have a look at _Malpertuis_ by Jean Ray. Finding the rare translation might already prove a challenge. The movie with the same name is also worth watching."
3,predictable....,"This book came recommended to me by several students and a couple of friends, so I read it. It wasn't boring, as some of the other customer reviewers have said. It definitely kept me turning the pages. I enjoyed the symbolism, the allusions, the story telling. Until...about midway through the book I figured out two of the ""big"" things that were going to happen in th end. I kept reading, hoping I was wrong (because there's nothing worse to me than predictiing the ending and then being right), but when all was said and done I had both of the big ""surprises"" pegged. Maybe they weren't meant to be surprises. Maybe I was supposed to be able to predict the ending and so I'm complaining about something that was as it was intended. Shrug. It was a decent read on a long, slow day curled up with my dog beside me. Other than that, just sort of ""eh."" I like twists I can't see coming, not the ones I can see approaching from miles away."
3,What is going on?,"While the writing style is engaging, and the story line is interesting enough, I kept wondering who all of the gods were. There were different names for gods (the character with the nickname ""low key"" is really the god Loki, for example), and I had the feeling that I was supposed to know who these gods are. The personalities, the skills, the frame of reference for the gods - these all played into the plot, but I don't know who the gods are. I would have appreciated a reference section that listed the gods and gave some background on them, or footnotes when a new god was introduced.Lacking that, the gods angle of the story was confusing for me."
3,drags on,"I had a love, hate relationship with this book.It dragged on too long, I was glad it was over, but on the other hand I did finish it."
3,A little disappointing,"I heard so many good things and high hopes, but was left wanting more. The main character never really seems fleshed out. His final resolution is predictable and incomplete. There are a couple supporting characters that scream for more attention as they are only in a few scenes. It's got a good pace and a gritty noir private eye feel to it, none of the humor from Neverwhere, and the numerous references to mostly obscure deities will lead to a lot of Wikipedia reading. It's worth reading, but it is not up to the level it's been ranked in ""best of sci-fi"" lists I have seen."
3,Better than expected.,"I really enjoyed this book though I could have done without th gay oral sex scene. Otherwise, very interesting and well done."
1,Boring,"This is a boring book and not written particularly well. Nothing much happens in this book. I must admit the premise is fantastic, a great idea, but the delivery of the idea was such a let down. All the fantastic mythical stories were there from thousands of years of mythology but I found the manner in which the story was strung together amazingly unimaginative. The book could have been so much more.All of the negative reviews on Amazon seem to touch upon the point that this book is incredibly boring at times. I found it a real struggle to finish. So many clichés (""he came to a fork in the road"") and predictable plot elements destroyed the book for me. Buy the book if you like badly written ones, and also if you like a book to be lightly strewn with irrelevant overly-descriptive gratuitous sex scenes. God-porn is something I hadn't heard of before I read this. An absolute burden of a book."
1,I represent a small Minority,"I wanted to take some time before I write a review, just to calm down and sort out my thoughts. I know, I represent a small minority of readers. Why? Because I disliked the book. My personal description of the book is the dumbest book of the year 2007(I finished the book just before Christmas). I don't know why people like it so much.I didn't like Gaiman's style at all.The protagonist is a fool and you get tired of him 1/4 into the book as well as from others. There is no humour, the story and characters are flat and not interesting.I just had to force myself through the story because:a) so many people recommended itb) to be qualified to judge the bookc) it was a long flightI believe I am going to avoid Gaiman for quite a while. He is definitely not my cup of tea."
4,"If you're a little strange, you'll like this book","Its a very unique book, with a storyline balancing paranormal weirdness with all-too-normal weirdness. Highly readable, if not a definite classic for the ages. I won't go in detail, that's what the other 400 reviews seem to be for (Note to potential reviewers: these aren't book reports. Spoilers suck).Nevertheless, I must admit the parallels to Douglas Adam's ""Long Dark Teatime of the Soul"" struck me early. Nevertheless, where that was a comedic take on a similar theme, this work is far more surreal and a little more dark, and both have a deep consideration for the subject at hand."
4,Fun Read,"After a few years in prison, Shadow is released to find that his wife tragically died along with his best friend. Few remnants of his past life remain and he quickly meets Mr. Wednesday, a mysterious character that requests his services. Their journey continues across America to meet many of his new boss's unusual colleagues and acquaintances. Through a series of twists and turns, the novel unfolds into a great tale of intrigue and mystery culminating into a battle between the old and new Gods of this world. The novel is the winner of both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 2002. I enjoyed the book, but unfortunately had very high expectations prior to reading that were not entirely met. Neil Gaiman is a talented writer with a prolific career. I would recommend the book and look forward to the HBO series adaptation that is planned to come in 2013."
2,Beyond his Depth,"Neil Gaiman is beyond his depth in this novel. He simply can't write a successful or substantial novel yet. He still needs the padding of comic illustrations. He writes excellent short stories, but hasn't mastered the art of writing a book. The editor should have cleaned up and shortened the book as it rambles and tends to veer off into plot developments that don't add anything to the story. The premise of the book was very interesting, but the execution lacks clarity, character development, and suspense. I found myself not caring about the main character, as he seemed a bit dim-witted and uninteresting. The ""American Gods"" that littered the chapters were cartoon sketches of beings that should have had more spiritual mystery or meaning. I found this book hard to finish, at the end I simply didn't care about the resolution of the story."
1,misplaced accolades,"I'll keep this short and sweet. This book was one of the most frustrating of the year for me, and I'm not sure why so many people are blown away by this book. The plot is very awkward and very little seems to happen throughout the novel. Why the book is 600+ pages is beyond me as it seems to me it could have been half that and noone would be the wiser (but still equally annoyed). The only thing that I really enjoyed about the novel itself was the concept of all the gods living amongst the regular joes. Great concept, poor novel."
3,"Good, but not Great",I enjoyed American Gods. However my mistake was reading Stardust and Neverwhere first. I didn't feel any kind of connection with the central character Shadow. I felt the characters and settings in this book did not live up to Stardust or Neverwhere.
3,Enjoyable in parts.,"I am a fan of Gaiman and I have a number of his books in my collection and I will also buy his forthcoming collection "" Fragile Things"" released in September 2006. I hope the next book I read by him (Anansi boys, a sequel of sorts to American Gods) is more enjoyable. American Gods is not a bad novel at all, it's good, but, not the masterpiece it purports to be. It doesn't somehow fulfil it's ambition and I think Neil Gaiman will trump this novel at some point with the considerable talent he has. Bottom line for me is that all in all, it's a mixed bag of a story. Good but not great."
2,just kind a stupid,I really did not enjoy it. It seemed too fantisafull for me. Maybe I just don't like that kind of book. I read another of his books & semi liked it.
3,Disappointing Wrap-up,"SPOILER!!!!!!I really liked this book. The writing was great and the story interesting. But the ending was a real let-down. No war? Come on, we waited for it the whole way and there wasn't even a battle? Couldn't you at least have had Shadow witness some of it before he gave his big speech?"
5,"Simply put, wonderful",Watch out Stephen King and Dean Koontz. This story is amazingly told with a fresh new writing style I have not seen in ages!!! I can't wait for your next novel.
4,A captivating story!,"Shadow is released from prison early after receiving some sad news. On his way home from prison, he is followed by a man whom he can't seem to shake. When this man, who refers to himself as ""Wednesday"", begins to appears uncannily at all places that Shadow travels, Shadow's interest in him him becomes more acute to the point that he finally agrees to take a job with him. Shadow is not entirely certain of what his job entails, though.This story walks a delicate line between reality and fantasy, incorporating characters who may, at first glance, seem normal but are not. In addition, there are many dreams that Shadow experiences that also make it hard to distinguish between fact and fiction in his life. Shadow, however, is a likeable fellow and one with whom the reader sympathizes and wishes well. It is for this reason that this novel succeeds so well. For every difficulty that Shadow faces, the reader is left hoping he'll make it through his bizarre experiences unharmed."
4,A Dark Look at America,"I was surprised by how much I liked this book - I'd never beenable to get into Gaiman's work before (particularly Sandman), butI found this to be one of the strongest works of modern fantasyI've ever read.This is a different kind of road trip and it tells the storiesof many gods, both living and dead."
2,Very disappointing,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book because I really enjoyed Neverwhere. The premise and beginning of American Gods were great but the second half was terrible. The ""plot twist"" and climax were very poorly thought out and not interesting in the least. It seems like Gaiman got tired of writing this book half way through and just scribbled down some nonsense to finish it. I'll think twice before reading another of his books."
2,sandman rehash,"Reading Neil Gaiman's Sandman series of comic books was a life altering/enriching experience for me, and keep in mind I am not much of a comic book reader. That said, American Gods seemed to be derived largely from the idea of gods existing and fading largely by the depth of the populations belief in them: a core plot motivator in the Sandman series. What you don't get in American Gods is amazing graphics, characters you really give a flip about, and an intriguing 'oh my gosh where will this go next?' page turning plot.Do yourself a favor. Order Gaiman's Preludes and Nocturnes instead, and read the idea behind American Gods. His novel format retelling isn't worth the time."
3,American Gods,I was really excited to read this. It's too long though. Get on with it. Some interesting characters though. I did enjoy the dialouge.
4,Good book,"I had heard of this story before, was glad to finally read it. A intriguing tale, some parts a bit disturbing. The Enhanced aspects did not work on my 3rd generation kindle, so I have no idea if it was worth it."
2,"American Gods, very disappointing","I was terribly disappointed. ""Neverwhere,"" by the same author, was the ""One Book/One Chicago"" recommended by Mayor Daley a few years ago. I loved it and thought I would enjoy ""American Gods."" A great concept but the narrative moves way too slowly and there is none of the sparkling dialogue or character development that made ""Neverwhere"" so enjoyable. I was also disappointed in Gaiman's introduction to ""Gods."" Very unseemly, indirectly insulting anyone who criticized it. Shame on you< Neil."
4,A good fantasy novel,"A hard-to-put-down and very enjoyable read. A nice fantasy novel, sprinkled with allusions and reminding to dig deep in one's memory of mythology. The characters are easy to relate to and draw you in. Gaiman certainly has a message, but I didn't think it was the profound philosophical statement on the American spirit that some have taken it to be. Generally, highly recommend it."
3,Too much fantasy,"This is a good book for fantasy-lovers. Since I'm not one, I struggled with this book. Gaiman's writing style is really good so my only complaint is the genre is not for me."
2,"all over, didn't follow it",The story line was all over the place..maybe would come to together at the end...Just didn't have the patience to stick with..
4,"Strange, but nice","With a rambling plot that doesn't end up where you expect it to - three or four times - this book is incredibly hard to categorize. It's fantasy, it's edgy urban thriller, it's murder mystery, it's hallucenogenic magic realist literature, it's horror ... it has old gods moving among us, a walking corpse, secret agents, and small town life. Honestly, it's not quite what I expected (and I'm a long-time Gaiman fan), but I kind of liked it. He's said in his online journal about it that it's designed to repay rereading - that after reading it once, you should come back and enjoy seeing where he set things up, the motions backstage in the magic act that is this book. I don't know that I will, but it was worth reading. Try it from a library, if you don't feel like justifying $20 worth of book; it's impossible to say whether you'll like it or not until you've read it."
3,Very Clever & Fun,"This was a Christmas present from my sister-in-law last year. I completely loved Anansi Boys and was eager to tear into this one.I must say, I really thought Anansi Boys was a better book. That isn't to say I didn't like this one, I just thought that Anansi Boys flowed better.I really loved how he took ancient mythology and breathed new life into the old stories. I honestly found myself wishing more of the story was from the perspective of the old gods rather than the main character, Shadow. I just didn't find the main character all that engaging. I thought it was really clever plot and I love his writing style.It reminded me a lot of another book I read years ago by the title of Shadows Fall by Simon R. Green.Overall, a fun book that just didn't match up to Anansi Boys."
5,Incredible work,"Gaiman is a modern bard, he weaves the old tales into a new mythology that is complete and inspiring. Thank you Neil :)"
3,Waaaay Overrated,"After reading 112 pages into this book, I asked myself 'OK, when is this book going to GRAB me, and reel me in with it's brilliance...' Needless to say, it didn't. What with this book being showcased everywhere from glaring displays set up at your friendly neighborhood bookstore, to gleaming write-ups in a lot of book magazines, I was expecting something more. I know, I know... I only got to page 112, but still, THE HOOK should have been evident early on - to me, it was not. I felt like I was forcing myself to finally get to the part that deserves all the adulation. Not to be too critical, the pages I did read were well written and interesting. The story of old gods vs. new gods is a cool idea to show how artificial and materialistic our culture now seems to be... but ultimately, THE HOOK just wasn't evident enough to justify the price tag. Wait for this book in paperback...used."
5,He gets better every time,"With his latest published work (American Gods), Gaimen amply demonstrates that his skill as a writer and more importantly, a true storyteller has not plateaued. American Gods is sweeping in breadth and thoroughly enjoyable. Gaimen continues to fascinate readers with his conceptual orginality and creativity. The story is engaging with a tremendously identifiable protagonist, while on an abstract level, incredibly thought provoking with implications about society in general.Perhaps, the only criticism one can legitimately level at Gaimen is that his writing is so fluid, effortless, and believeable, that one can question where his encyclopedic compendium of mythology ends and his creative imagery begins.In short this is another fine example of Gaimen's particular trademark, the captivating storytelling that one hopes never finishes."
3,Had Potential But Fell Short,"Man this book had some serious potential with the premise, but it disappointingly fell short. It is a very confusing text to wander through and at times is ridiculously confusing and I am a pretty intelligent person. It's just that he doesn't develop the plot quick enough and you are having to wait to learn more. I did read this book rather quickly and I must say that it is an entertaining trip and the ending is rather good, but trying to digest this thing is what takes the majority of ones' time."
3,"It was OK... I liked ""Never Where"" better","I have never read any of the ""graphic books"" by Neil Gaiman, so I cannot venture forth an opinion comparing them to his novels. I started reading his books with ""Neverwhere"" which I loved, then ""Stardust"" which I very much liked, and now this book, ""American Gods"". I have not completely formed an opinion on this book; it was OK, and it was sorta wierd. I have read lots of WIERD books - from the kind of strange you get from Stephen King to the wierd you get from the discount book store, (which sell books that the publisher gives them for pennies because they didn't sell well)... anyway, in my mind, the jury is still out on this one."
2,Recommend Adams over Gaiman,"A much better and funnier take on forgotten gods is Douglas Adam's The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul. I found it hard to read Gaiman's book without thinking that he stole the main plot points of Adam's book, and added a lot more fluff and sex to pad it out."
3,One of the more bizarre books I have read,"American Gods is one of the more bizarre books I have read. Having just finished this book, I'm not really sure whether I enjoyed it or not. Based on the premise that a god survives as long as they are remembered and worshipped, there are numerous twists and turns as old mythological gods fight to survive against new gods. The story line was hard to follow at times, but intriguing enough that it kept dragging me back for more."
4,entertaining,a wonderful exploration of the back road travels across america while traveling with 10000 yr old Gods.
3,"Weird, hard to read..","Not sure what it was, but it was a hard book to get through. I did not hate it, as such, but fealt uneasy and strained while reading.. Not a bad ending overall.. I just can't put my finger on what I didn't like about it.. Besides being long.."
4,Original and refreshing,"I looked forward to reading this Bram Stoker award winner and having finally finished it, I was glad I did. Although I think a lot of the middle could be trimmed down and a few of the psychedelic dream scenes edited, it was a satisfying read. The beginning really pulled me in and was quite powerful. Thankfully, the ending was just a powerful and made a nice bookend to the tale. Neil seemed to wander at times, but he always managed to steer back on course. Be warned -- this is not light reading. Nor is this a horror novel (I'm not sure why it was nominated and won the Bram Stoker award) Also, strangely, the idea of the plot is very similar to J. Michael Straczynski's RISING STARS comic book series. If you want a book to pass the time, American Gods is not the one. It is deep and thoughtful and makes the reader work for the treasures Gaiman hides inside."
5,How Does He Do It?,"Bravo, Mr. Gaiman! An epic tale that is a must for those of us who are lovers of mythical characters & creatures. The common interwoven with the unreal in a convincing manner is a tribute to your writing skill. I had known of your name from your comic book work, but had never read anything of yours until now. It makes me wonder what I have missed."
4,Enjoyable,"At first, this book seems to have a simple set-up with a ex-con finding out that his wife died. But then more and more characters get thrown in (although most are rather minor) The presence of new gods - like Media - made the book intriguing, as well as different gods doing different things or simply living as mortals. Overall it was a good read and I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for the anticlimatic ending.Personally, my favorite character was the Queen of Sheba/Bilquis. I loved the scene where she was eating the guy, and I was rather sad with what happened to her. She certainly didn't deserve to end that way!"
2,Unimpressive and confusing.,"I'm sure this would have all made a lot more sense if I were, say, a specialist on gods throughout all cultures all over the world during every time period ever studied by man.However, I am not.Overall, I thought the main character was underdeveloped, the story was drawn out in painfully pointless details and scenes, and the climax was utterly pointless, especuially in light of the ending.Ultimately, I found the book to be well-written but not my style.Read ""Neverwhere"" if you really want something fun. This just lacks color."
5,Interesting story about the transplanted Gods of old...,"I originally bought this book for my husband, who decided he didn't want to read it (isn't that always the way?) so I did. I never had heard of this author and had no pre-concieved judgements about what I might find. And I was pleased at the interesting set up! This is really an interesting book about the nature of religion. What happens when everybody stops believeing in a God? makes you think. Warning! I am a dork, so perhaps that may have something to do with my enjoyment."
5,One of the best books I have ever read.,"Neil Gaiman is one of my fav. authors, and this is probably one of his best book. Absolutely awesome. Mind bending..."
2,Doesn't draw reader in,"The basic flaw of this book was that the inherent disinterest that the protaganist, Shadow, has in the events happening around him gives the reader the impression that this aren't really amazing events and shoThere's a plethora of fascinating characters in this book, but there's no glue that binds the whole story together because the main character doesn't give a damn about anything. I was more interested in when the clunker was going to fall through the ice than anything else. If the protaganist doesn't find interest in anything else in the book, why should I?"
3,Not as fun as Neverwhere,"Perhaps this was an overly ambitious subject -- I thought the book was swamped by it. The premise is a terrific idea, but I didn't think the plot and characters were nearly as well-developed. The lead character was vague and uninteresting to me, and the story was very slow-paced. I found it easy to put down. It struck me more as an ""important"" work than a fun one.Also, I didn't care for the bad language and explicit sex. The author was probably trying for a grittier feel in this book, but for me, it was still a turn-off.Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite writers, particularly for prose, but this book was a disappointment to me."
5,Believe in Everything,"Shadow gets out of prison only to find that his beloved wife is dead. He then takes a job from a strange old con-man in which he learns that all the gods, new and old, are real; they want to use him as a pawn in a dangerous game where dreams and magic shape reality, and he isn't being told the rules. He learns that coins can save or condemn, but in the end are just tools in a shell-game. Shadow also learns that his wife will always be there for him when he needs her most, even after her death. ""American Gods"" is a strange and uplifting journey through the history, legends, side-shows and small towns of the United States of America, as well as a personal grief process, through which a man finds himself again."
2,"A painful experience, amateurish","This book was one of the most painful reading experiences I can ever recall having. I had zero connection with the main character. The story is bafflingly disjointed. I purchased it solely on the 5-star reviews here on Amazon, an impulse buy. Never again.There are some interesting elements and concepts, for sure. But it's a mess. I struggled to finish it over two months, when a book this size should take me 2 weeks max. SO PAINFUL"
1,Turned Me Off To Gaiman Forever,Don't be decieved by the raving reviews you'll see about this book. The homosexual crowd has banded around it to cause this. This book is painfully bad in every way. It's not just the homosexual make-out scene that's done in such a way that even homsexuals gag while reading it. The first 75-pages of the book could be a used as a classroom example of wasted words. Actually the first 100-pages could easily be condensed to 15 without losing a thing. That's perhaps the worst thing about the book. Take out the insipid homosexual scene and cut it down to 50-pages and he could have had a nice little novelette. Instead you've got a book that will have you skimming through every page. Wasted words equal wasted time. Don't waste yours.
4,Unrealistically Entertaining,"Shadow, the main character, is a likeable fellow. He is a model of a good-at-heart kind of a guy with his own sins or shortcomings to live. His surreptitious quest moves along pretty swiftly. Furthermore, Mr. Gaiman, the ultimate creator of amazing characters, is very perceptive of area slang all across the United States - at least, the route that Shadow trudges - and he amicably brings them alive on paper in compelling dialogues. His tale is a mixture of fantasy, myth, science fiction, love story, mystery, action, and comedy. All burning questions are duly answered at the end of the novel. Mr. Gaiman's brilliance and phenomenal inventiveness has resulted in a book that is a page-turner from the beginning until the end."
4,"Great, but something missing","The majority of reviewers are right, this is a great novel and well worth reading. The only thing I can say is that there seems to be something missing. That something that takes a novel from being a good novel, to making it something meaningful. When I finished the novel, I was left wondering what it all meant.However, as I said before, it is a great novel and fun while it lasts. Maybe it will speak to you more than it did me."
4,Thought provoking-- a worthy fantasy read,"A man, released from prison a day early due to the death of his wife, is approached by a man of strange abilities, and winds up on a strange trip that tranverses the country and brings to light the unique qualities that make America America, and the bizarre nature of the warring and fickle pagan gods.American Gods is this, and much more.American Gods is a relatively fast paced and well written fantasy novel, with an edge of horror. Fans of both genres should check this novel out."
3,Why all the hype?,"The Bad: The characters are mostly dull, the plot (in some parts) is almost entirely predictable, and the story tends to wander where it doesn't need to.Now for the good: Some interesting ideas about Gods and their origins. The ""Spook Show"" for instance, so many people believe in the men-in-black and black helicopter mythos that they actually come into existence in the story. That was fun reading. And there is an entire sub-plot about disappearing children that just plain gave me the willies!!It was a decent book, but it was by no means excellent."
2,It's Just that Nothing Happens,"After hearing so much about this book, I thought it would be only fair to read it a few years after it has been out. But as another reviewer already wrote, this book is ""numbingly SEDENTARY"". It's painful to read as there are sentences that don't belong. There are too many ""gods"" who disappear and really have no significance. Basically, it's about a bunch of people (who are gods), that sit around, drink coffee, smoke, and bull. Really.I can't believe I paid for this crap.I'm giving it 2 stars because the Gods idea is cool."
3,"Good writing, slow pace, moderate characters","I thought Mr. Gaiman's writing was very competent, but as others have said, the pacing is pretty slow and the characters are not very deep. I didn't connect with the protagonist, but the character of Wednesday was worth reading about. I also agree that the absence of representation from modern organized religions seemed like an omissions, but of course the American Gods in the novel are important ones: Media, Money, the Internet. I have a feeling a short story could have told the tale of the conflict, and that the short story was stretched across America's roads, mostly stopping off on out-of-the way small towns and points of interest.Read if you are a fan of Gaiman, borrow if the premise sounds interesting."
3,"Deadlines, Deadlines, Deadlines","Disclaimer: Am a diehard Gaiman fan...have read everything he has written (more than once), own signed limited editions, etc. While I was enchanted by the potential of this book, I was not blown away reading it. It has all of the trappings of Gaiman's work....mythical & transformative themes (this one involving an archetypal journey into the heart of America), wierd and endearing characters, twisted and dark subplots, rich layers of historical reference, and magical juxtapositions of worlds and dimensions with the ""commonsense and everyday"". But I was left feeling like this was a pre-final draft with many of the concepts remaining hazy and underdeveloped, not crisp and polished, perfect and savory. Possibly a reflection of an unrealistic publisher's deadline?"
3,Interesting ideas - short on delivery,"The premise of this novel sounded intriguing enough to purchase this book - something I rarely can afford. But - the ideas - and there are many - don't add up to a whole novel. Perhaps a few novels, if given more substance and time. I wanted very much to be immersed in an epic adventure, but it often felt uneven - short stories cobbled together in the midst of a promising tale. Some of it was very absorbing. Yet, I couldn't quite suspend disbelief for long enough."
5,"Fascinating, funny, and hopeful","This is a strikingly original, beautiful book. It's a fun read full of clever references, clever dialogue, good characters, good plotting, and witty dark humor. But beyond that it's hopeful and original, capturing something about the essence of what America is all about in a way that I've never seen it done before. It also subverts and alters a number of tired tropes in very creative ways, an experience I always find mind opening."
3,Fascinating premise,"Loved the combination of myth, social science, religion. The main character is fairly well drawn, the action/suspense of the plot is well done, but the gods were barely more than a plot device in the book, the pursued and pursuer, with not much fleshing out or real relationship established between them and the people they followed to the New World. The set-up held such promise--why do we worship or discard deities? what makes them endangered: culture, modernity, science, knowledge, callousness, cynicism....? WHO are they--quasi-human meddlers, like the classic Greek gods, our shadow selves, given only the powers we allow them, another race, our ego and flaws...? Something about the book, although plenty hefty, felt incomplete, like there was much left out. I kept thinking I would find the rest of the story in the next chapter, but I never did."
3,"Great writer, but perhaps wrong medium....","For me Neil Gaiman lost his steam after Neverwhere. I read all his sandman comics and looked forward to his novels, but this particular one didn't amaze me. Perhaps I was expecting too much. Mr. Gaiman displays his talent for colorful imagery all throughout the story, but it does little to MOVE the story. The book read like a series of short tales, and maybe he should've published it that way.If you never read Neil Gaiman before, I'd recommend Neverwhere before purchasing this title. That one has a more solid story and showcases Neil Gaiman's wonderful sense of humor."
1,Quantity not Quality,"Unlike Gaiman, I'll keep my comments brief. His plot and storyline could have easily been condensed into a 50-page novella. The characters are one-dimensional and hollow. Much of his scenes and descriptions are filler. Gaiman could argue that gee whiz, that's the whole ironic, clever point! Still, it doesn't take 500+ pages to do that. By the way Neil, in case you didn't know, dream sequences are quite cliche these days."
2,no meat in this one,"the idea of gods in modern times is not new, and even if it was, i'd expect the author to give us some substance whether it be in the skilled use of scientific or historical info, but there is nothing of interest here, no intracacies or complexities. i expect the book won the hugo on the popularity of the author's graphic novels."
1,American Junk,"I bought American Gods because of all the hype and because I had read Neverwhere and loved it. All I can say is that American Gods was a failure... I can handle machco, but the writing was poor and poor writing is unforgivable. Where was his editor? I especially loved lines such as ""She entered the room through the door."" So? She was in a funeral home. What was she going to do, pop in through the window? Neil Gaiman is not a great writer; he is an opportunist taking advantage of a book-buying public no longer capable of reading anything more sophisticated than a three line blip thrown across a televison screen. I wasted my money. Boo hoo."
2,Disappointing,"Gaiman is an intriguing talent. While the ideas which drive his writing remain inventive and interesting, his ability to capitalize on these ideas is lacking. This results in books which appear interesting in brief plot reviews and back covers, but are unsatisfying when read as books. American Gods suffers from poor characterizations, bad dialogue, and ideas which are never explored past the superficiality of the back cover. Indeed, the main plot consists mainly of creating a world which could be fairly interesting, but then spending the latter half of the book destroying it with slapdash plotting. The poor plotting makes it seem as though Gaiman was merely trying to get the book out on time by throwing things into the book and resolving any problems by deus ex machina. On the other hand, I found one of the subplots to be fairly compelling. In all, though American Gods is full of ideas which could be interesting if explored, this book never reaches its potential."
2,Starts out Great...,"You have to be a certain type of reader to enjoy this Gaiman work. I have only read one other of his, ""Neverwhere"" and I recommend that one highly! But this one has soooo many twists and turns, you feel like you are a rat in a giant maze.The main character, Shadow, lacks depth, and Gaiman segways into so many side stories in order to bring the plot together-you tend to feel like, ""Gee, is this ever going to get to the point?"" Overall, I would've rated this higher, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as ""Neverwhere"", the plot is very slow and runs into so many walls, you get a headache reading it! Not to discount Mr. Gaiman's writting skills, he is superb at his craft, but I just couldn't get into this one, and had to force myself to finish it. You can try this one if you want, but I would suggest getting it from a friend or the library. But, if you want to read some better work by the author, get ""Neverwhere"", it is a much better read that moves a lot quicker."
2,American Gods,"I dropped out of this one by about page 200. I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book. Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way. I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there."
2,Lousy,"Man, this book was pretty stupid. The concept was interesting, but it just dragged on and on. The ending was unsatisfying. Should have been a novella."
2,"Intially engaging, but prys itself from your attention...","My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive. Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel. But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved ""turn-a-round"". The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines. Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey. Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers. ""Last Call"" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to ""Gods"""
3,"In summary, it was okay.","I read this at the recommendation of several friends. It was an interesting concept, but it struck me as mostly predictable, and childish or immature. These attributes may not bother most readers, but it really took me out of the story. Possible spoiler alert here: The war is a little too comic bookish for me. This fake ""good vs evil/old vs new"" scenario is very played out, even with the man behind the curtain element. Again, it was predictable and that took away from the novelty of the fantasy elements."
4,Makes you think.,"It will definitely make you think.What is out there? How do the gods become gods??In my mind there is but one God. The rest, are tales that have come from life experiences. That's just my experience though."
3,Didn't finish,"I really enjoy Neil Gaiman. I even enjoyed this book. Unfortunately, I found no reason to complete it - I abandoned about two-thirds of the way through. How to reconcile those? Well, the situation in the book and Neil's imagination are fascinating. The main character is mildly interesting. But the story is not compelling. I knew we were heading somewhere, but I just didn't care. Glad I read what I read, didn't feel need to find out how things resolved."
2,American Gods,"Sorry, not a book for me... Too jumpy, complicated, things left without explanation, confusing. Not a kind of a book that you can get into it and relax."
4,Almost great,"I devoured this book in what is pretty much record time for me to read something this long. The only thing that kept me from giving it a full five stars is Gaiman's tendency to, well, meander. I feel that at times, especially in this Tenth Anniversary edition, he overindulged in that tendency. Nevertheless, it's a fantastic tale with a satisfying conclusion. No spoilers here. Just go read it."
3,"Well, I guess I don't get it...","Like the other reviewer who has read since he was 5, I've been reading a long time. I bought this book at the airport, having forgotten to bring a book.I'll keep this short. If you enjoy fantasy and mythology, read this book. If you want to be scared or kept on the edge of your seat, find something else. I didn't find this book to be at all suspenseful, it was quite predictable. I got the whole ""plot twist"" quite soon.It wasn't the worst book I'd ever picked up but it wasn't the best either. I have read books that I didn't want to put down, Boris Starling's ""Messiah"" and Caleb Carrs ""The Alienist"" come to mind, however, this wasn't one of those.Don't believe the hype, this book isn't going to renew your hopes for non-fiction."
1,ticked off-waste of time and money,"As one other review stated, I kept waiting for the payoff and the brilliance, but it never came. It is a long book and since the book had so many amazing reviews, I thought it would be great, but it wasn't and it didn't really make any sense at all. Too bad the people in charge of getting the book out there, missed the mark so badly.That said, I am happy for any artist that makes it througha nd becomes a success. Neil, better luck next time."
1,Couldn't finish it,"This is one of the few books that I couldn't finish. Discussed it with my friends. They couldn't finish it either. It was hard to read, the plot (what plot?) was incomprehensible. Didn't care about any of the characters. I read about 3/4 of the book before giving up. I dislike not finishing a book I started but this one wasn't worth my time."
1,terrible!,Absolute boring gibberish and nonsense. Couldn't make it past halfway. Is this just a runaway snowball of people all liking something because everybody else does? It's just maddening trying to read this. Makes me never want to read anything else by him. I must not get it because everybody seems to love this book. Ugh its like pulling teeth waiting for something to happen or something interesting to pique my interest or get me thinking....anything! I can't think of a single good page in the half of the book I forced myself to read. Garbage.
4,A Different Kind of Road Trip,"Neil Gaiman has redefined the New World. Just as in Nevermore, Gaiman turned his unique perspective on the everyday and presented us with a strange tale that takes the reader across a different terrain; in this case, America. In American Gods, Gaiman explores that happens to the old gods/ideas when they are replaced by newer versions. The old gods decide that they're not going down without a fight, and each man (or woman) is on his own, with our hero, Shadow caught in the middle. This urban fantasy / adventure has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, but there is plenty of action and adventure and weirdness to go around. It's a unique story from a unique and gifted writer. Very entertaining."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I had never heard of Neil Gaiman or read any ""modern fantasy"" prior to being indroduced to American Gods. I had no idea what to expect going in. A few times I wondered what my friend was thinking when he highly recommended this book. Afterward I could not wait to dive into [[ASIN:ASIN Anansi Boys]] (which is not a sequel, but instead a darkly humurous spin-off).Gaiman is an amazing story teller. Even his characters tell awesome stories. There is so much character development seemlessly blended in this captivating story, I felt concern for the protagonist AND his friends. I have since read a few books by this author, and it only gets better. ""AG"" is witty, unpredictable, inspired, and engrossing. If its your first foray into this genre or author, you will agree its unexpectedly good."
4,Gaiman is about the journey,"In this book as in other Gaiman novels, the characters are the star. The story is good and the settings are OK, but it really is his imagination with the characters that set him apart. The two main characters, Shadow and Wednesday, both are complex and enjoyable. The supporting cast is also really varied. In turns spiteful, ethereal, crass, innocent, folksy, and crumudgeonly, the supporting characters are really rich and is the X factor in making this a really enjoyable read.What I liked:Outstanding characters; varied and imaginativeThough parts were predictable, I thought that the story in general lent itself to lots of surprises.Really fun take on American culture, history, and folkloreMeh:In this as in Neverwhere, the journey was better than the destination. If you are looking for spectacular climaxes, this is not it.I really liked it and I think that others interested in general fantasy will as well."
3,Good god...,"Enjoyable book, not top-notch Gaiman. The final denouement was kinda predictable... but satisfying, none-the-less. Some of the meanderings with the gods through their adventures grew tedious (I wanted to shoot them all at several points), pleased I made the effort to see it through though."
1,Great while it worked,"The Sony was great while it worked, but as the set stopped as soon as the warranty ran out. Sony used to make great, long-lasting products, but it seems like they've lost it lately. The set itself is very heavy, and so if it does stop working you've got a huge problem in getting it repaired."
2,"Good picture, but not a reliable set","I purchased this set, brand new, on Sept 2003.On Aug 2004, and now on Dec 2005 both the picture and the audio failed. Thank goodness I have extended warranty.I have been a Sony fan for years and I am very disspointed with this particular set.So much for the money !!Maybe Sony is not what it used to be."
1,Good while it lasts,"We got this tv 2 years ago and, yes, it was great. But it has stopped working recently and the estimate to fix is $600 - not great. We have called Sony to try to negociate a deal (getting the part for free and paying for the labor only) but they offered no alternatives. We loved the tv, but I agree with the other reviews - 2 to 3 years of lifespan is not acceptable. We are getting a new tv and it will not be a Sony..."
1,A waste of time,"""Try The $50 Dinner Party"" by Sally Sampson. Sally's book is super and we used for a very elegant party at our large beautiful home."
5,"stunning, relevant and addictive","CHURCH (the book, like the physical structure of a church) is haunted by ghosts, but also very much of this world. It is almost impossible to put down. The poems leap off the page, as if the speaker (""Here I am, captured, in my black & white phase""-- speaking, in this case of a photograph) haunted the physical pages of the book. Nazarene brilliantly accomplishes this through the dramatic (never melodramatic) staging of the poem on the page, complete with italics, boldface type, jagged lines, etc., but there is nothing unearned here-- as Nazarene says in another published poem (not in this collection): ""No false moves."" While loss is a common thread, and despair never far off, these are deeply religious poems (irreverently so, as in the work of Franz Wright), full of risk and beauty. The physical book itself is lovely to look at, with its (also haunting) cover art by Anna R. Treborze."
3,"Outstanding photography and graphics, good price","This little book is my ""giveaway"" to people interested in getting started in bees. It's not a complete guide by any means, but gives someone interested a basic overview. It has outstanding photos and graphics on the beekeeper's year. Has a European slant many may not like, but I found quite interesting. Great price for size and content."
1,A poor attempt at a beekeeping book,"What a title ""Beekeeping: A Practical Guide for the Novice Beekeeper Buying Bees, Management, Rearing, Honey Production"". Too bad that the title was almost half the length of the book. This book has a very european look and feel to the instructions and hive structures mentioned. I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in beekeeping with the one exception of, if you are writing a book on beekeeping use it as a guide on how not to write one."
1,Deceptively advertised RIP Off,PROSOntrac delivered the package on the date promisedCONSCoghlan's Rectangular Sleeping Bag LinerThis Item is actually an over-sized pillowcase that adds very little warmth and is extremely difficult to enter/exit while it is inside of a sleeping bag.Shipping cost was almost half the purchase price.It is unlikely that I will gamble by purchasing a Coghlan product in the future.
2,Cheap and Poor Quality,"This product was a huge disappointment. I liked the idea of a ""blank"" log, where you can create your own categories, but there are two big problems with this book: paper is very light weight and low quality, so pages start bending and twisting awkwardly; and the printing is so light, you can't easily find log information for a certain day.I went back to Bill Rodger's log, which is much more user friendly.."
4,VERY USEFUL LOG,I was tracking my workouts in a notebook before buying this guide. The layout is a great way to organize notes about your running. In addition there is helpful training information in the log. I recommend this training log.
2,In need of some editorial care ...,"While not lacking at all in imagination and fanciful storytelling, this first (and self-published) novel suffers from syntactical and stylistic problems which more careful editing would readily address. While I look forward to seeing how writer Crowell develops in his further TRUE ADVENTURES, I would just recommend that anyone who tries this book and enjoys it, should also try Patricia McKillip, Robin McKinley, Terry Brooks, and of course, Tolkien for similar stories, told by sublimely silken prose stylists."
2,Susie,"I am 9 years old and I thought this book was ok. Not great, not horrible. Maybe better for boys than girls. Every scene was really busy. Some of the people/things seemed weird. I don't think I would read it again. I usually read my favorite books two times."
1,"DON""T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER !!!","After reading this book, I will never be swayed by the cover again. This book does not live up to the wonderful illustration on the jacket. It is very confusing in the beginning as well as at the end. The action confuses the plot and there are too many characters.So admire the cover, but save your money and don't buy it! This is definitely not Harry Potter. It doesn't even approach ""The Lord of the Rings""."
1,PLEASE DON'T WRITE ANOTHER IN THIS SERIES,"People have said that I am ""wise beyond my years"".That may explain my frustration with this book. It feels like it was written for VERY little kids, not 10 and up. I have read and love ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia"".No comparison.If you are a serious young reader, BEWARE!!! For the rest of you little people, have fun if you can.Sincerely,Alexander"
4,How Peter Oatencake became a household name...,"My 11 year old daughter is gobbling up books lately. She really liked Silverlance a lot! The characters are endearing, the book is full of action and mystery and magic and moral searching. I found it a bit too full of action for myself, but my daughter doesn't agree. She's waiting to read the next book after this. A few of the characters really have become household references: Peter Oatencake is a kind of mysterious, magical woodsman who befriends the eclectic group of young animals and satyrs and centaurs and humans who are searching for Silverlance. Oatencake is a great warrior with a conscience and sense of mystery and duty and a bit of a loner. For some reason my daughter just loves him and we hear his name pretty often around here. I'm personally glad to be able to explain centaurs and satyrs and typical mythological beings. We are looking forward to reading more!"
5,Well worth reading,A well written love story one with enough back ground to make you think what has happen in the pasted and what time will tell for the planet earth in the future.
4,romantic thriller,"This book was really very interesting and while it had some low points, I enjoyed it. I recommend it to anyone who likes romance novels"
3,Rick is way overrated...,"True, the melody is upbeat and lively, but if you listen to some of his lyrics, Rick sounds like a jealous teenager in ""Jessi's Girl,"" thinking being ""funny & cool with the lines"" will get him a girlfriend. Also bothersome is that in that song, he sings about the body of Jessi's ""girl"" as if she were a piece of meat and complains about her ""loving him with that body."" Rick also sounds like a complainer in ""I've done Everything..."" Some of those lyrics make you wonder if he has a negative attitude toward women. He sure could use a few lessons from Steve Perry. Steve isn't ""funny & cool with lines,"" but knows how to respect women as human beings. I was always so amused that when I was a teenager, so many girls were drooling over Rick, but me...my fave was Steve Perry."
5,Simply Great!!!,"This album was the staer of something really big for Rick with this CLASSIC album... You have the hit Jessie's Girl as well as ""Daddy's Pearl."" My All time favorite though is ""Inside Sylvia."" I saw him in concert at the Ohio State Fair and he stood on my wheelchair and sang it right to me.. The songs has a special meaning to me.. There are other songs on that album that SHOULD have been hits. But Rick will always be the #1 singer in my house!"
5,Indespensible!,Be sure that you do not overlook this meca of manufacturing. the japanese sure did not. A rare and precious jewel.
1,Another self-published POS,"Self published sales pitch trying to persuade you to do laughable things to reduce stress. Berkeley hippies, Birkenstock sandals and tofu might be on your wish list if you liked this book."
4,10 great ways to reduce stress,"Here are the ten ways to manage your stress in this book:1). Calm down by concentrating on your breath.2). Appreciate what you have in your life.3). Tense and then relax different parts of your body.4). Visualize success.5). Slow down6). Appreciate yourself7). Practice smiling8). Stop doing what does not work9). Say no to people that try to over burden you.10). Accept what you can not changeand live mentally in the present do not stress yourself out with the past or future.Buy this book for more in depth discussion of the above, if you find this to be common sense, move on to another book."
5,"Incredibly thorough, inspiring book.","Funnily enough, when I first received this book I was somewhat disappointed. I had learnt to draw with Betty Edward's ""Drawing on the right side of the brain"" and somehow mister Nicolaide's book seemed a little too academic to me. False. This is a wonderful book, with exercises that to last for a lifetime. The author states that you should use them in the prescribed order, but I think it will benefit those who have worked through the Edwards' book but still want more. Although the book is brilliantly inspirational and oozes with a kind sense of humour, it shouldn't be mistaken as new agey stuff. You do learn to draw if you put the hard work it requires. It is definitely worth every cent (or in my case, peseta)!."
5,The only book worth reading on drawing.,"There are many books that are what I call: ""draw just like me books."" This approach is clearly counterproductive to any inspiration, creativity and the antithesis of the artist's spirit. I have taught drawing, painting at post graduate levels in NYC. I have yet to find a book wherein you really are able to elevate your ablity as an artist or one who profoundly appreciates the work as a viewer."
3,for later use,"I agree with rv's review, this book is not to get you drawing recognizable subjects in a short amount of time. It is however for people who are serious about dedicating their time to developing an understanding of forms and structures and how they are related to the process of drawing. I bought it and once I sat down to read it I realized I won't be using it immediately. But I will definitely keep it for later use when I have the patience to do things such as gesture drawing and blind contours, for now I'm really wanting to learn to draw from lines and shapes, so if you are like me then a more beginner type book like Betty Edwards or Mona Brooks is more appropriate. I have also purchased keys to drawing but haven't received it yet."
5,the real deal,"i started practicing with the first few excercises in this book years ago, and still think of it. it was enormously instructive even with my very modest attempts. a series of excercises that build on one another, and focus on doing the drawing (you're supposed to go draw, man, anywhere, anything) rather than some result. the simple lessons teach you to see. they can be quite demanding if you put your heart in it, though any time whatsoever spent doing these excercises is instructive, if only to help you see the work of others. wonderful book..."
5,loosening up,"I found this book to be a great help. It really loosened me up. I hadn't even realized how much loosening up I needed. :)I've had a little art instuction and this book is adding to that greatly. I believe it is more important to see first.Technique will always come, but won't do much good if perception is lacking. If you believe that, then this book is for you, too.I know there are people who don't believe in these methods. That's cool. This book won't be for them and this reviewisn't for them, either. But for those of us who do enjoy Nicolaides methods, this truly is a natural way to draw."
3,Not for beginners,"I'm sure this book is all that many reviewers have shared but for me,being a complete beginner, its way over my head and abilities. I need to work at an entry level and continue before I can appreciate and grasp all this author offers. I have found, The New Drawing on The Right Side of The Brain to give me this. also picked up Keys to Drawing & Secrets to Drawing REalistic Faces. Each of these selections are better suited to the level I'm at and didn't overwhelm me to take this artform on."
3,Beware of Small Print,"I purchased this book as a reference and study guide for my art studies. What I received is not worth the money I invested. It is not that the subject matter is irrelevant, which it is not. What I received was a paper backed volume that had obviously be photo reduced to the point where I have to use a magnifying glass to read the schedules of study proposed by the author. Additionally, while the author has been a leader in art study, some most of text is extremely dated. If one wishes to revisit the Art Study League of forty ears ago, well and good, but this book was not what I had in mind."
4,The standard for drawing education,"This book has been used in drawing classes for years, and for good reason. It gives step by step guides and exercises to improve your drawing skills. If you did the exercises as prescribed it would take one full year to complete them as prescribed. It is the equivalent of an entry level drawing class in college.However even if you don't have the time or patience to do all the exercises for the recommended time there is still much to be gained by reading the book and doing the exercises for as long as you can."
1,Modern art junk,"I browsed a copy of this book at the library and I looked at paintings done by Nicolaides on the internet. As far as I can determine, it seems he was just another deluded member of the modern art movement of the early 20th century. I haven't seen any evidence that this book will make someone a good figure draftsman. Justin Sweet's drawings are terrible. I choose not to be one of the lemmings who follow this charlatan Nicolaides. If you want to be a great draftsman of the classical tradition, this book is utter rubbish. We did one minute scribbly gesture drawings in life drawing class, but only for warmup purposes."
2,"Never recieved it, but got my money back","I never recieved my book, but everytime i wrote to the seller he responded back to me and refunded in full my money."
2,The Natural Way to Draw A Working Plan for Art Study,"The Natural Way to Draw: A Working Plan for Art StudyNot for the beginner like myself too much text and not enough drawing tips. Probably will be a good book to have once I have learnt the basics, I bought it because the reviews were all so positive and I am sure it will be of value to me in the future, it just seems like it would be hard work to get through."
3,Interesting Book but not the author's best work. . .,"but I think some will enjoy the novel, but for those of you who don't enjoy it and it's your first exposure to Ms. Manees, don't let this prevent you from reading other novels by Ms. Manees. I highly recommend 'All For Love' and 'Fantasy'.As for this book, the hero is a great character and I wish more time was spent on him than the heroine but I appreciated the message found in the plot."
5,Another Winner!!!!!,"I LOVE this author. I have all her other books, and this one is as wonderful as all the others. Don't make us wait so long next time, Ms. Mannes!"
4,Nutrient timing summed up in a few words,"Lets see read the whole from front to back. What I got was consume protein with some carbs before workout, during workout drink some gatorade with about 6 grams of protein. After drink 16 ounces of chocolate milk. Hour later have protein with hardly any carbs. Finally eat lots of healthy food with protein to grow muscles."
2,For anyone wanting to Gain Muscle ...,"... this is a good, quick read. The science is there to back their claims. My main issue with this is that taking in the amount of sugar they recommend before during and after a workout is dangerous. Use whole foods not simple refined sugars!"
5,Must Read for Fitness Enthusiasts,"This book is a great example of how science and performance interact with each other. The book lays out in full detail strategies on how to utilize optimal nutritional intake to support athletes of all kinds. The author uses scientific studies to back up his advice. Without a doubt this book would help anyone achieve their goal, be it performance or aesthetics."
3,Could be much shorter - like 2 or 3 pages,"To sum up the book: Drink a quickly digesting protein/carbohydrate drink within an hour of training. 40 grams protein, 60 to 80 grams carbs. Whey protein with Dextrose, Waxy Maize, etc.All the rest is just the science which you really don't need to know about."
4,The first book to read if you are new to nutrient timing,"If you don't know anything about peri-workout nutrition this is the book to start from. The information nowadays starts to be quite well known for people ""in the known"" but however it's a good read for everyone and a mandatory read for newbies."
3,a little vague,"not sure what to expect just a disappointed in some of the text and explainaitions in book,maybe if i glance thought it once again i will enjoy and understand it better"
3,"One Star for the Reader, Five for the Author ...","... I guess. Is that a fair compromise? This title was urged upon me by a face-to-face friend whom I respect a lot; I'm willing to suppose that it's a fine book since many articulate people say so. Me, I couldn't get past page 20, though I'm willing to take the blame for being an unresponsive reader. I found the boy narrator insufferable, or rather I would have found him insufferable if I could have found him plausible. Possibly I'm just sick of the genre of atro/preco-cious adolescents with colorful dysfunctionality in their parentage. But the narrative syntax is annoyingly coy and artificial, and I have no intuition that the story will take me anywhere where I haven't been before."
3,"A swift, enjoyable story","I enjoyed this story and recommend it. The voice and setting are appealing and it's a good, quick read."
2,Couldn't Finish,"The title of the book drew me as I had been on Edisto Island for a time. I am sorry to say, however, that I could not maintain interest in the book. Using a mouthful of words, the book was fluff. Did it ever go anywhere? Was this just a vignette of life? I am confused. I would read a couple of pages and follow the descriptions and then a couple of pages more, I had drifted off and could not recall what was happening. I guess I expected more. I would recommended that readers save their time and go to some other island."
2,Anything would be finer,"This has been a wildy overrated novel since the day it was published some fifteen or so years ago. Powell was praised for his verbal inventiveness, but what he has here is verbal obfuscation. Exactly what is he trying to say? It is hard to tell once the reader's entangled in his verbal trap of dialect, half-baked description, and misguided rhetoric. And none of the characters, with the exception of the black cook, is memorably drawn. We really don't care what happens to any of them. Only one scene, the depiction of the boy's attending the Ali-Frazier fight, with the locals rooting on native son Joe Frazier, shows any genuine comic invention."
1,Bored me to tears!,The author of the book sounds like someone trying to establish themselves as a writer rather than a teller of a story. He has a very strange way of writing and this constantly distracts you from the story. I have seen 14 year-olds write better novels than this. By page 42 I was so annoyed I put it down and never went back. It's doing a good job propping up my bed now though!!
1,beware! full of rodent poo,"See nbc news:[...] lProducts recalled for having rodent contamination, rodent droppings, dead rats, urine... and other horrors. There was a disgusting story on nbc news with former employees."
4,great value,"Great quality, quantity, and value for the price.I have seen cases that are better organized and easier to navigate though."
3,Not too bad for a one time viewing,"It's not really like the classic movie version (I haven't read the book since I was a kid, so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to that). I am pretty sure the book did not include the crash of a modern small aircraft by other visitors to the island.The production and effects are ok. I really wanted to see how they addressed Captain Nemo and the Nautilus, but I was disappointed there. The acting is ok. If you like Scifi, you might want to watch it once, just to say you saw it. This might have been a ""made for TV"" movie from the look of it.This review is for the the Amazon instant video version."
2,Must have been made for T.V.,"I was a bit disappointed in this. Seems like it just tries too hard. There is very much of a ""cutesy"" element in this movie for it to be an accurate version of the original story."
4,Each volume is worth its money,"I bought all of 'em. Too bad that amazon.com doesn't offer all volumes of ""Death Row"" The book comes with interesting statistics and info about America's worst criminals and prisons. The stories about specific murder cases are well researched and written by various journalists. Call it macabre but the tons of pictures of the death row candidates are absolutely grippingly!"
3,"Good reading, low on information","The book was well written and made for entertaining reading. However, the materials were more like a pep talk on good customer service. I needed, and expected, more straight-forward tips of how to implement an improved service program."
1,Worst Customer Service?,"I do not find this book credible because it did not contain any information, anecdotal or otherwise, about Amazon themselves. Amazon may have the worst customer service in the world and myself and tens of thousands of others, if you believe posting in blogs, etc., think this, too.The book would have seemed much more credible if there had been even one story about the horrific service at Amazon. It also seemed to confuse customer service issues with personnel management. In this regard the book's title was somewhat misleading.Regardless of the author's inability to tell the difference between personnel management and customer service the lack of Amazon's mention as having one of the worst customer service departments in the US (world?) is the biggest failing of this book."
1,Waste of Time,I was excited to read about customer service stories when I read this book - but felt cheated after reading it. It seems the author can't tell the difference between Managment and Customer Service. I can appreciate what the author was aiming for in this book but felt he misses the mark.This is not a book I would recommend. Actually it is a book I wish I hadn't purchased. But that is just my opinion.
2,Kinda lame,"I got this for a few bucks and I didnt think that the game made much sence. It got really boring after a while, the graphics are better then sims original."
3,Singles: Flirt Up Your Life Rating,"WEll the is game all right overall. If you don't have anything to do then this game is ok. It's time consuming, but if you get into it, time just flies by. the only anoying thing is that the voices are just shiburish it doesn't make sense; we like to read subtitles and hear the actual words at the same time."
2,Dull Sims clone,"What separates this game from the Sims? Very little. Sure, the graphics are excellent. But overall, a very dull game. It takes WAY too long to establish a loving relationship between the couples."
2,Singles: Flirt Up Your Life,This game was ok. It was not as fun as I thought. The whole point of this game is to sleep with your roommate.
3,"mildly carrotcakey, but ok. Frosting, not ok","The taste is not that of normal Carrot cake, but it is not unpleasant. The cake by itself is average, and makes a reasonable if expensive treat for a low carb diet.The frosting on the other hand, is not that of carrot cake frosting, and it IS unpleasant. It requires cream cheese to make, and to be honest, you would be better off just spreading the raw cream cheese on the cake. We did not, but if I ever buy it again, I will try that."
4,A great resource for fishkeepers.,"This is one of my favorite books. It provides information and more importantly photos on nearly 2000 fish. The information gives you the basics about each fish, how big they get, what they eat, are they agressive, etc.But the best aspect is the photos. With over 1900 photos it is the first book I go to when I want to look up a fish. Or when I'm thinking of what to put in that empty tank I'll often browse through this book looking for neat fish.This book gives you the most for your money!"
2,REMASTERING FLAWS? OR WAS IT JUST MY CD?,"The only song on this CD that I wanted was ""Anytime"".I believe that there is a flaw in the way it was mastered.It occurs shortly after Eddy resumes singing after the guitar interlude. His voice goes to a high note and then he speaks the word ""time"". This same flaw occurs in another cut as well. RCA has not responded to my e-mail inquiry. Is this the way it is supposed to sound? Is the version of ""Anytime"" recorded on the other Eddy Arnold CD (Greatest Hits) the same?"
1,Hate to break the news,...But ALL of these songs are remakes made for Mercury Records in the early 70's.Arnold is famous for remaking his hits over and over again. You really have to be careful when you buy his cd's.Stick with his RCA recordings.
4,The Richest Man in the World,"I'm looking for Eddie's recording that I thought was ""The Richest Man in the World"". Does anybody know the real title of the song and where I can find it?"
5,Great Music,My mom wanted this so she could listen while driving. She has really enjoyed the old songs and now I love them too.
5,Eddy Arnold,"This music takes me back to my childhood. great memories of my dad. If you like country music, you will love this."
1,Beware! parts of this birdhouse are CARDBOARD!,"I was pleased with this birdhouse until after the first rain when I went to check on it. The gingerbread details on this birdhouse are made out of CARDBOARD and started to crumble when I touched them.I had read the other review about poor wood quality, and did not expect great things for $11- but cardboard? seriously?This should be listed as a decoration only! not for outdoor use!!"
3,A Little Flimsy,The price was right but the construction uses rather flimsy material. I actually wanted working birdhouses and these didn't look like they would last a whole season outside. My wife coated them with marine varnish and they became somewhat more sturdy but I think these are better as decorations than birdhouses.
2,Poor wood quality,The design is nice but I was a little disappointed with the quality of wood and paint used.
4,Victorian bird house,This is a nice looking house. I think it's more for looks as the holes are too small for most birds though our blue birds certainly checked it out often enough. My husband mounted it on a high pole next to two other style bird houses I liked and they are cute side by side.
1,Dark,"I purchased a Sharp Wizard Organizer, & found it to be very difficult to read. The writing is very dark & even when you use the very little lighted back area, it's still almost impossible to read at night.Dr. Marvin Handler"
3,Good but missing key ingredient,This is a good product for keeping track of your daily appointments. The one bad thing about it is that it is not compatible with outlook 2007. I am guessing that it is compatable with other versions of outlook. The seller was reluctant to answer my questions about compatibility. They did give me a return authorization to sent it back. I did keep the product because it is a good product. The upgrade is coming out in mid 2008 according to Sharp products.
3,Not Bad For Starters,"This palm pilots good for people who are just starting to use pda's. If you want somthing simple to put your schejule or phone numbers in, this is good for you. It could have more features though and it sorta hard to see what's on the screen. But otherwise its a good pda to start out with."
1,Stop Consider : Very Poor Quality,"I am very sorry to say that this light attractive electronic organizer looks good but stopped working after ONLY THREE(3)DAYS!!! The unit was in the ""protective"" carrycase when I accidentally dropped it from a height of TWO(2)feet. I thought nothing of it until the next time I needed the unit. Half the screen was blank and could not be restored. It is very inexpensive and it appears to LIVE DOWN to the price."
2,Make sure you know your needs before buying,"This product performs as expected for the money, I guess, but it has some limitations that don't fulfill my needs.-The screen is hard to read in any light.-Takes too many steps to input data.-There is no way to input weekly/monthly repeating items on the calendar without putting them in one by one.-I wanted to keep track of a shopping list but was limited to 96 characters in the memo feature.-I have Outlook Express and presume that it will not be compatible.-The cover flips open nicely but would prefer one that locks shut.I was hoping to use this as a phone book/calendar/note pad that I take with me everywhere but will probably be back to my old wall calendar, post-it notes, and paper phone list in a month or so. I just bought this unit yesterday and am still learning about it so with time I may find other features to overcome my misgivings.Wish I had done better research before I bought this and then I would have bought one that better suits my needs."
1,It's Not Useful for a Student,"I bought this to keep up with my college assignments and work schedule. It isn't very useful because when you enter a ""To Do"" item for a day, it will only show it to you for that day. I either had to enter the assignment for every day which is a lot of hassle or remember that my 10 pg research paper is due 12/5 (Isn't that the reason I bought it?) It could work for people who have tasks/appointments that only require 1 day's notice, but for students who have several long term projects, it is a waste of money."
4,Worth the money,"I cannot comment on the Outlook Sync, since I have not and probably will never use it. This organizer does what it's supposed to do...it stores names, memos, and has an alarm. There is also a password protection feature, which is nice, and a backlight as well as a few other basic useful features (spell check, Eng/Span dictionary). It's not a PDA, doesn't go online, no color...etc. That's why it's cheap. It's a great, basic, organizer that looks more professional than it costs.My only issue was that the functions were not very intuitive. I had to look up a lot of things and go online to get the full functionality going."
2,Sharp Organizer,The screen is hard to see in many daylight conditions and the screen backlight does not help.In expense mode your memo has to be very brief.There are way to many steps to learn to us this in various modes.I had a Sharp yo 370 with a keyboard for 12 years until it went bad and liked very much. No comparison in ease of use between the two and the info you could enter in expense mode.I will be looking for a keyboard organizer again soon.
2,Worth about $15 and nothing more,"I got this for $15 as an upgrade to my $5 Royal. I realize that it's not a PDA but I expected more, much more.Pro:- nice looks- backlit- multiple way to hit Enter- nice sleeve- nice looking monthly calendar- standard software sync (e.g. MS Outlook)- quick startup/shutdownCon:- clunky input interface (similiar to cheaper models)- The 5-line display sounded great until I started using it. What a waste of realty, especially when the scheduler is used where half of these lines are filled with useless info such as Alarm and Reminder (end time is questionable). Meeting subject/topic is no where to be found in the front page.- It works OK as a standalone unit but functions poorly when sync'ed up to a PC. Sync SW is deficient is every way. Data can't go both ways. Either doesn't load or loaded more than once. If set up going one way, can't change on the fly.- everything else"
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this so called Wizard Organizer and used this for one day and without any hesitation I returned. This is my frank advise to anyone who is looking for a PDA. Add some more money and buy some thing which is worth. It is very difficult to understand the function. Secondly it is not at all user friendly and screen doesn't look good at all. Happy surfing for a better organizer !!!!Vinu VarughesePhiladelphia
5,Old Technology But a Great Bargain,"My 90 year old father-in-law wanted a small organizer that ""had nothing to do with computers."" This device is very intuitive and he loves it."
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND!,"I would never recommend this product. It was ridiculously difficult to work, and took me about a month to become familiar with this pocket organizer. I find it much easier, faster, and much more simple to just use my phone to keep my contacts and appointments. The SHARP WIZARD OZ-290HII was not worth the money. After about a year now, using it on and off in month-long intervals, ONLY HALF OF THE SCREEN WORKS. I cannot understand, or see anything on it anymore. I checked to make sure it was not near any magnets, and I have never dropped it. I do not have kids, and I was the only one using the device. No one could have accidently, or purposely, done this. I tried replacing the batteries, and that was a failed attempt at reviving my pocket organizer. I am considering buying a new one, maybe a PDA instead. I would definitly spend more money elsewhere, than waste it on this terrible product."
2,"Hard to use, user instructions are not easy to read","I bought this to replace an older sharp organizer. I liked the old one a lot, but the lines of resoluations were starting to disappear so I order another sharp. The style is different from my old one, this one has a stylus.The new one is hard to use, the display is hard to read and the user instructions tend to leave out some major details which case some frustrations with trying to set up the organizer. I had to call Sharp and they even told me some of the insturction manuals for this model wereincomplete. I will keep it only because I need something to put all my phone numbers into. But I don't see this becoming something I will use everyday."
2,hard to use,"After hours of trying everything in the manual, online and customer support I am still unbale to link this device to my computer. Without Outlook one cannot view a schedule, you can only set an alarm. Not very useful to a busy mom. I was really looking for a way to keep up my calendar. It is nice looking and I am sure if I could link it it may even be a good electronic calendar. I guess the bottom line is - you get what you pay for...I will try to unload mine at a garage sale"
1,Waste of Money,"This organizer is a waste of money. I bought it for my teenage daughter. We both found it so clunky to use that it just sits in the drawer. Each entry takes 3-5 steps, reviewing data is even more ridiculous. HUGE waste of money...spend the extra bucks on a low-end PALM."
4,The OZ-290 Is A Good Deal For What You Pay!,"When I received this item, it was in the kind of packaging thatstores use to display items (like batteries for instance). I was POSITIVE that this COULDN'T be what I ordered. But, since I had it in hand, and my AMEX card was billed, I decided to open it. I was amazed at the quality and features it has!PROS: It has Schedule/To Do List, Telephone/Address book, Anniversary AND other reminders, an Expense mode for people who have to turn in Expense Reports, and more.CONS: I ruined 2 pairs of scissors trying to get the thing outta the package! It comes with a 9-prong PC attachment cable, AND a CD-Rom, but when I opened mine, no CD. AND they don't tell you up front your PC ""MUST BE IBM OR 100% COMPATABLE"" AND you have to have ""MICROSOFT OUTLOOK"".COMMENTS: This is a great little PDA, it's a quality item (thecover opens on 2 hinges so the cover can lay flat behind the display, cool feature.) Overall, THIS IS A GREAT ITEM AT A GREAT PRICE."
3,good bang for the buck,"I just bought this little item and as far as I've used it, it works great. The bells and whistles work as advertised, it's easy to learn the features and I'm glad I bought it. The only negative so far is the hook up to my P.C.. It requires a 9-pin port, which I have one of, and that is currently being used by my U.P.S. unit. Since most new PC's today have a multitude of U.S.B. ports, it would make sense to make the connection thru one of these. Still, if you don't need a ""Palm"" then this serves its purpose nicely."
