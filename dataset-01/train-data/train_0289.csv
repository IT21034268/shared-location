1,returned,"item was returned, because 3 dvd had obvious scratches and one was therefore recognized neither by my dvd-player nor my pc. series i guess are good quality so the 1 star rating is only for the dvds."
2,Return costs are more than my order.,The overall process of recieving the item was good. However I recieved the same item for a gift and wanted to return my item only to find out the return address is in Great Britian. The return costs would have been more than the item purchased. If I had known the return address was out of the country I would not have purchased from this perticular vender.
5,"IT'A ONLY ME, BUT:","CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION: GRISSOM AND COMPANY ARE GREAT. kATERINE IS A SUPERSMART AND SEXY X-STRIPPER, SARA LOVES GRISSON TO DISTRATION, WARRICK HAS A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER THE SIZE OF NEVADA, AND NICK, IS NICK. JM"
1,Bad,"I actually had to return this item TWICE now. Amazon is being wonderful about it and giving me a full refund each time, but both times this arrived with the product damaged. The packaging was fine but the first DVD was scratched and the case was damaged. So disappointed cause we really want to watch this!"
4,6 seasons strong - but for how long?,"The original CSI series is still the best of the lot, and some of the episodes are hair-raising. But one can feel the troubles the writers have to go through to get a fresh approach to an old problem: the stand-alone episodes. The nature of the series demands that a problem must be solved in one or two episodes, and we go along with that. But the nice thing about CSI was that the writers could insert here and there items that showed you the characters were not only real but also growing. And that is what I'm missing somewhat in the 6th series; they stand still. They do their job, and quite well, but they're getting a bit mellow. Gosh, even Ecklie turns out to be human. I'm missing somewhat the conflicting stuff our own lives are built upon. But the acting and the scenery is still superb, and a a whole the series are still Quality TV, somethinh sorely missed in most of the other (crime) series."
5,"This was really good, fabulous, exquisite, and wonderful!","Read this book, it's filled with so many happenings, it's very fun to read. Don't take my word for it though.. You got to read it"
3,Eh,"I have to say, I was not impressed by this book. I can't really see why there are so many positive reviews. And yes, I've read a great deal of fantasy literature.It moved along nicely for quite some time, and then in the end, bam, deus ex machina, (spoiler alert!) the bad guy explodes and peace is restored. That's about it. And if it had ended on a cliffhanger, leading me into the next book, that would've been just fine. I was expecting that. But it didn't. I can't see taking the trouble to get the next book. Fflam was a good character, and really I don't care much about anyone else in the saga. The main character sort of ""grows"" by default, by virtue of wandering through the woods and running away a lot, but I don't really see it. Whatever love story is supposed to be happening, I just don't believe, and there's not much else to keep my interest. Maybe I'll go re-read The Belgariad, or LotR."
5,COOL BOOK,"This book is cool. its got really exciting wars, magic, and lessons to learn. its a great book, and those who like harry potter, and those who wish that magic really did exist and dream of becoming a hero themselves should read this."
4,A great introduction to fantasy,"A fantastic introduction to the fantasy genre, especially to children too young for Piers Anthony's Xanth novels, R.A. Salvatore's books or the Dragonlance saga.I have been reading fantasy novels on and off since I was in elementary school, and the books that got me started were the Chronicles of Prydain, which I first began reading in the 3rd grade. The books are well written, the plot flows well, and the entire series has a sense of EPIC-NESS to it.For older readers, the series may seem a bit ""cute"" at times, but you could do far worse than this book within this genre."
4,An old favorite,"This book is great! It includes lovable, quirky characters, adventure and maybe even the stirrings of a romance between royalty and an assistant pig-keeper. Read it to find out for yourself"
4,The Beginning of the Quest,"This book was written in 1964 and reprinted in June 2011. it is a excellent book. The characters were interesting and complete. Hen Wen the porphetic pig seemed a surprising character. But, pigs are smart. The book is writen for children in the sixth to 10th grade. The story is relatively short. It is full of action, adventure and a bit of romance. I would recomend it to anyone who likes to read fantasy."
5,Enchanted Journey,"""Hen Wen, Come back!"" Taran cried dashing into the woods to retrieve the oracular pig. The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander is a magical, fictional tale about a boy named Taran's quest. Taran is an Assistant Pig Keeper, so when his pig Hen Wen runs away, he goes after her. Throughout his journey Taran's mission changes from finding Hen Wen to saving Prydain from the evil King Arawn and the vicious Horned King. Taran has many helpful companions including a poetic and faithful creature named Gurgi. Gurgi is funny and gives the story life. I loved reading this book and I know you will too. Buy a copy and embark on the journey."
5,An excellent book,This book is yet another example of Lloyd Alexander's superior writing abilities. This book is the first book in a series including the High King and the Black Cauldron.
4,Not just for kids.,"Though this is a great book for kids, it is also very entertaining for grown-ups as well. Even a slow reader can read this book in a day and the story and charcters are all very interesting. Not quit as good as its darker follow-up, The Black Cauldron this is still a very good book. And don't be fooled by those who say Alexander rips off Tolkien. The simularities are the same ones that virtually every modern fantasy story has with Tolkien."
5,A joy at each reading,"My father started reading this series to me when I was about five. I LOVED these books for their humor and adventure. When I was in fifth grade they were assigned reading, but I was not in the least bored. The adventure and humor were still there, but I also began to appreciate more the richness of the characters. I was delighted that heroes were portrayed as people with fears and hopes, capable of making mistakes and of learning. Despite the fantasy, the people were real. Now, more than twenty years later, I have learned to read Welsh and recognize some of the inspirations behind the stories of Prydain. I have more respect han ever for the creativity that went into these tales and the sense of ballance and underlying faith that makes them worth reading again and again"
3,A Good Story,"A review by AndrewThis was an excellent book I enjoyed it a lot. I think at the begging it was a lot like Zorro due to the fact that, one person does not know the art or the sword and one does. Then the one that knows the art begins to teach the other. There are some parts of this story that were familiar. I am not sure if those parts were so good that they were made in to a different story. It also could have been that they came from another story.I think that somebody that likes fiction should consider reading The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander. This was more like a fantasy type story, but that doesn't matter it was pretty well written and had parts of suspense and mystery."
5,The best book,"I read this book last year in my sixth grade class. I looked at the cover and thought it would probably be dumb, but when I read it I couldn't put it down. It was so good! Lloyd Alexander is a great writer."
5,A Nifty Book,"As a young teenager in 1983, I saw the cover of this book at my local library and just ""had"" to have it. ""The Book of Three"" is the first of five books that take place in the magical land of Prydain. The main characterm, a boy named Taran, is desperate for adventure. Heck, most boys are at that age. However as Taran learns, one should be careful for what one wishes for because you just might get it!The book is written for young adults and as such is fast-paced and doesn't go into great details. However the story isn't so watered down that adults can't get into it (although I blew through the book in a day as an adult). Gurgey's ""crunchings and munchings"" are funny and the romance between Taran and Ellonwy reminded me so much of the girl I had a HUGE crush on in 6th grade! Very sweet and nicely done! A good book for young teens."
3,"Alright, but Could be Much Better","This book was a pretty good book, but far from perfect. The biggest problem was the final battle with the Horned King. It would actually be interesting if Taran didn't pass out right at the beggining and require it to be told to him. I also would prefere Taran's running away to not be so early to let the reader get a feel to how life is going for him. It would also be a lot better if there was a little bit more violence."
2,the book of less than three likeable characters,childrens litturature is good but this slightly arcaic is missing a key elements. a slightly likeable main charecter. this is the story of an incomitant asistant pig keeper who loses his big like any incomptent he take matters into his own hand. as he wonders though the slightly more interesting back round he meets people who understand who patetic he is and whish to get karma by helping him this story is touted as a comming of age story when in reality is is a warning to children that life is grim and teenages are incompatandt i have read this book read this book multipal time to find out if it was good it got worse it retelling
1,Boring,"I think this book was boring. I don't understand why it is called the book of three. I thought the ""Castle of Llyr"" wasbetter but still only so-so.Leah Kohn, Age 6"
5,Well-written and engaging for readers of all ages!,"I was first introduced to this series when I was in fourth grade. I have always loved the stories, but even more so now that I have read the Celtic myths from which they were inspired. Lloyd Alexander did a wonderful job!"
5,a good book!,"My name is Lucy. Now I am in the middle of The Arkadians,another great book by Lloyd Alexander, and I also like it very much.I Iike The Book of Three because it's a good book, veryinteresting, and the characters are very realistic. I would liketo meet them! If you like Lloyd Alexander you might want totry Tamora Pierce and Diana Wynne Jones, too."
5,Absolutley the BEST!!!,"I NEVER write reviews or comments online but I had to for this series. This is my absolute favorite series of books of all time. I started reading these when I was 9 years old and I still go back and re-read them every few years and I am 27 now! I would recommend this series to anyone at any age! I just watched the Disney remake of ""The Black Cauldron"" and it was awful. It is a travesty and does not even come close to doing this series justice. Why did they even bother putting Lloyd's name on it? They changed everything anyway and combined parts of the book and basically just blew it! I was so upset that I am now going to read the stories to my children so that they can see how it really goes.Read this series. It is the best!!!!!!!"
3,Enjoyable,"The Book of Three was an enjoyable, quick read. Astraightforward sword and sorcery adventure. Fast paced, easy to read. Perfect for younger readers."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Pig smarter than pig boy.The hero of this story is a kid that is bored with the usual farm work and hanging around. He soom comes to realise that maybe that is not so bad afterall when the mystical smart pig gets away, and he runs into your garden variety evil army. These guys won't mind dicing a pig boy.Cue adventure with royal girl, warrior, animal man, and a magic sword."
3,OK so far,I'm almost halfway through this book and it is kind of boring in some parts but are really cool in others. Every one is saying it's good so keep on reading. And I totally agree with the star wars guy!
4,The girls liked it,I teach 4th Grade and I had a small group of girls read The Book of Three. They were close to putting it down after about 50 pages because of a thick introduction. After page 100 they wanted to keep reading when all other reading groups were done. I was surprised that the story hooked them as well as it did.
2,"an early Tolkien clone, from 1964","THE GOOD:* Good Welsh atmosphere.* Wholesome story for kids: good, clean, old-fashioned fun.THE BAD:* Hard to take the first book seriously because the main characters spend most of it looking for a pig.* Too many names and characters and nary a glossary in sight, save one for pronunciation.* Cliched situations.* Thinly-disguised liftings from Tolkien abound."
5,This is so good !,"This is one of the first booksI read .And one of the best .I could not put it down , I was too interested Tarans' adventures to even try . I began it when I was eight and considered it the best book I'd ever read until I read some other things .I addor it!"
5,The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander,"This story is about Taran a young assistant pig keeper who is [eager] for excitement and adventure until his pig runs away. While searching for the pig in the woods he gets into great danger for there is evil around in the land of Prydain. On his journey he discovers new friends and fights for good to overrun the evil, he also fights so that his home will not be distroyed.I very much reccomend this book to almost everyone. The author describes what is happening so well that it almost feels like you are in the book. The story is full of adventure fantasy and suspense; when you start reading it you can not put it down because you always want to know what will happen next or how it will happen. That is why I highly reccomend this book. I hope if you read this you will enjoy it just as much as I did."
4,my reveiw,"The Book Of Three is an enchanting and inspiring tale for kids ages 9-13. Taran an assistant pig keeper dreams of being a hero then his pig runs away. A simple job like finding turns into saving his entire country Pydain. Taran to his biggest adventure ever. Along the way Taran picks some interesting friends, like Gurgi, Fflewddur, Eilonwy and Gwydion (Taran's role model). The Future of Prydain rests on them."
5,"""Go with the music--spin, fall with it""","WHITE JAZZ stared at me from the shelf for two years before I cracked it open. I read a few pages and put it down, annoyed. It was confusing. I couldn't adapt to its beat. But I picked it up again and plunged in deeper. The rhythm of the staccato prose kicked in. The urgency of the plot swept me up. This stench of corruption overwhelmed me. It was intricate, complex, assured -- brilliantly freeform but always tightly structured. Late night reading led to swirling nighttime visions -- jazz that kept playing long after the pages had been slammed shut. Dangerous. Addictive. Feverish stuff."
5,MAKES EVERYTHING ELSE SEEM BLAND,"I first tried to read White Jazz in 1994 and could not cope with the chopped, ultra-hard-boiled style. But after easing myself into Ellroy via his earlier books, I found White Jazz utterly compelling and moving. His characters faults and virtues are so strong and intensely conveyed that I now have a problem reading anything else - it's all just too bland compared to Ellroy. The violence isn't heroic and glamourous, it's ugly and disturbing - like it should be. The plot is, as usual, very convoluted. Although the details are convincing, the story as a whole isn't. But it doesn't matter - style and imagery makes up easily for this. A masterpiece, again."
4,The unique vision of James Ellroy,"Ellroy writes like a Baudelaire on benzedrine.His vision is that of a merciless Gnostic, whereredemption wears a cheap suit and comes crashingthrough the door of your cheap apartment at 3 AM.Very Bleak..At times very funny. But the novel'soblique plot ultimately self-immolates."
2,a horrific book,"Ellroy is at his most depraved in this story of corruption and murder in the LAPD during the late Fifties. He piles one atrocity upon another until the whole thing sinks into a grisly, self-conscious parody.The plot is way too complicated. Ellroy acts as if he felt that in order to make this book stand out he had to litter the landscape with more perversions per square mile than any city could possibly hold. Then he layers in one of those sad, squalid, improbable love affairs that tough/bad/sick cops are supposed to thrive on and drags us along for what seems like an eternity before he reveals everything. I still don't know exactly what happened, and I don't care.Ordinarily, I like Ellroy. He has an excellent, clipped style that sounds like rocks being chipped from a boulder. But in this case, the sculpture that emerges is ghastly and unbelievable. Try something else, unless -- you're a masochist.EKW"
2,Not Ellroy's best...,"I am a big Ellroy fan. I have read almost all of his works. L.A. Confidential and the Black Dahlia are probably his two best. So far, I think this is his worst book. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I wasn't bothered by the violence or the plot, or the fact that Dave Klein is not much of a hero for a central character. He's even more flawed than Bud White. What made this book such a disappointment was the writing style. Even for Ellroy, it was too clipped, too abrupt. It was not only hard to read, but it sounded forced; like someone trying to write like the voice-overs in B-movie film-noir detective stories. It just didn't ring true."
3,Hard to Read,"If I recall correctly, this story is written in crime noir. I am not as familiar with the procedures and the jargon used back then as I am with current procedures and jargon. Therefore, I found the story more difficult to understand than I find current crime fiction to be. This is not because of TV shows like CSI, etc., although I watch those with close attention."
3,Ellroy does better elsewhere,"Disappointing considering it's an Ellroy. If it were written by someone else, it would be a great book, but I hold him to a higher standard since I know he's capable of it.Like all of his books the plot is an intricate web of corruption and nefariousness whipped up to the nth degree of complication. The ""hero"" is the usual motley mix of petty corruption and feeble instincts for good. The prose is standard Leonardese, chopped up, manic sentience fragments that should fail utterly but come together in a weird poetry of immediacy and power. Still, despite all that, this book disappoints utterly and completely."
2,A bunch of confusing nonsense that makes no sense,"Elleroy does a fine job of making me feel like i don't know what's going on. I reafd quite a lot and often have no problem keeping track of who people are and what they do, but Elleroy leaves me in the dark. So much so, that I often wonder if I am on Candid Camera."
1,artificial prose,"I really liked his earlier books, but Ellroy has let the reviews go to his head. He no longer writes, he just jots down phrases. It is not a leaner prose this way, just jerky and slow.Hemingway and Hammett wrote lean prose -- in complete sentences"
3,Pretty exciting..but...,"White Jazz was intense and lived up to all my Ellroy expectations...the only problem is that that description only applies to the last 160 pages! Having loved the Black Dahlia and American Tabloid, I picked up White Jazz. It took me three tries to get past page 200 before it was a story worth reading. If you love Ellroy, go for it. Newcomers, ABSOLUTELY do not make this your first taste...Something more to Ellroy's credit is that I found Klein to be a fascinating character (unlike some of the reviewers)...he was bad, real bad, but human and you can't ask for much more than that in good fiction."
2,"Fascinating writing style, but ultimately a waste of time.","Ellroy's style -- terse, rapid fire, compelling (at times). Like porno, attracting, fascinating, repulsing -- ultimately boring. Bad cops, bad guys, murderers, dopers, low-lifes. Life at its lowest, meanest. Evil with no insight.Who lives? Who dies? Waste 'em! Who cares?"
2,"re-hashed characters, annoying prose style","I hated this book. Why? The style Ellroy wrote in made it difficult to follow exactly what was going on; his typical prose is great, but here it's almost like a play script. Except, he'll take away the notice of who is speaking, and it breaks up the rhythm of the read. You have to go back and figure out who is saying what in a multi-person dialogue. It's annoying. This experiment bothered the hell out of me.Secondly, why are all his plots and characters roughly the same? The protagonist: an ethnic German cop or ex-cop, usually brutal, usually corrupt. The main bad guy? Always a mastermind highly corrupt cop. Throw in depraved sicko sexuality to taste. The setting is always L.A., but that's Ellroy's signature and I like that.In short, this is the worst Ellroy novel I've read but I still had to finish it."
2,out of tune,"Ellroy here asks us to join him in a riff of incest and pornography, accompanied by sociopaths and tedious plot riddles, all written in a bizarre bare style that starts to wear thin after about ten pages. No jazz, just incessant noise."
1,How the mighty have fallen!,"This has to be Ellroy's worst yet. The writing is in the style of Dr.Seuss crossed with a psychopath on crank. Subtract 300 pages from this atrocity and you still have a book too long, with no plot and no redeeming value, and mostly, totally unbelievable. In other words, a mirror image of the characters the author tries to develop.Ellroy's obsessive hatred of all of what he considers ""right wing"" gets tiresome very quickly.Ellroy scored some impressive successes with LA Confidential and American Tabloid. But White Jazz is almost laughable if it weren't so ugly. But for some authors - anything for a buck."
5,Light Green Leaves,"This is one of my favorite all time CD's. I will never miss a Little Wings show in my town, and will buy every CD, forever: because of this album. Light Green Leaves reminds to see beauty in everything, and to experience the world in awe and wonder... without being cheesy. Absolutely beautiful, and fun too!"
5,Jazz rock fusion blitzed by it's greatest living guitarist,"A very fine , very exciting set of jazz rock fusion, and it's a special treat for anyone who's been waiting for guitarist Alan Holdsworth to step on the gas and burn the frets. As has been said in another review posted here, Holdsworth has the uncommon ability to jump registers, accelerate through his chromatics and not lose the thread of his ideas. This is way you make every note fit within the sliding rhythms and offbeats you're negotiating space with and still maintain a coherent line of musical thinking. Bravo, and more, please."
3,Machinery,"I like some of Holdsworth work here, but all-in-all a piece of work that sounds like it was just thrown together with not much thought (or excitement) behind it."
3,"Some nice fusion, but sounding a bit stale at times.","Alan Holdsworth is definately a note worthy guitarist. I've heard some music from Anders and Jens Johanasson when they were in Yngwie's band. Unfortunately, the tunes sound a bit stale. The tone from Jens' keyboard went out in the early 80's, and Holdsworth's tone is from a similar era. Don't get me wrong. The drumming is very good, with emphasis on double bass technique. I would have appreciated more cymbal/hi-hat work. Anders could have picked up a thing or two from Dennis Chambers, or Carter Beauford (Dave Matthews Band). I do enjoy this disc, but feel that the production was left somewhere between The Breakfast Club and Rocky IV. It seems the only constant in life is change...unless you're on this disc."
3,The Spirit Archives Series,"Will Eisner is the only comic book artist to ever have his work shown in a museum of art. His most important work is the Spirit. The Spirit Archives series has brought together all of his work, that was printed in a weekly newspaper insert. However, after the work found in volumes 1 and 2, Eisner was called to active duty and served in the army during World War II. The Spirit carried on, but it was drawn by other artists. Eisner's work does not pick up again until the stories found in Volume 12 of the Archives series. The work in Volumes 3-11 is fine, but it is not the work of Will Eisner."
3,"Cozy format, missing sonnets","This is an overall lovely compilation of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works. It's the perfect size to throw in a purse, or keep on a nightstand. The format and font are comfortable and inviting, although the sonnets are not identified by number in any way.I do want to point out one short-fall, however. I have committed many sonnets to memory before owning this particular book and was looking one up to double-check I line I couldn't quite remember when I realized this one was missing. After a thorough sonnet-by-sonnet checking I discovered that this edition has left out 19 of the 154 sonnets. To be exact, the missing sonnets are numbers 16, 24, 25, 31, 37, 42,45,59, 80, 108, 122, 125, 134, 136, 139, 143, 148, 150, and 154.I appreciate the inclusion of the narrative poems and some songs, but buyer beware that you will not have a complete collection of the sonnets."
4,the last of the full grown men,"acres of suede=miles of talent.webb wilder fills a space few people can see,somewhere between big joe williams,elvis presley,and lenny bruce.i.e. rockin blues with a biting sense of humor.for total fun check out the mini-movie ""Horror Hayride"" ,with webb and ted roddy as r&r detectives.flippy!"
5,It's hard to review Webb.......,"It's hard to write a review of a Webb Wilder cd, since all of his releases have been consistantly great. Acres of Suede is no exception. You get the Webb Wilder mix of rock, country and humor, and it all Falls Into Place.The track that I remember from this one the best is Carrying the News To Mary, but the rest of the tracks are great as well.On this cd, as with his other releases, Webb is just himself. He doesn't care if he comes across campy or nerdy to people (Ye Olde Elephant Man), he's just being himself, and having fun. And that's what it is all about. Enjoyment. He's secure enough to not take himself that seriously.With Webb, you either get him or you don't. It took me forever to find a copy of this CD, as well as his video Corn Flicks, but both were worth the search, and the wait."
2,Local legend,"It's an OK cd for me. I liked a few songs, but not all. If you know him, you'll enjoy his style."
1,Just another book with selling title,"A nice book for the uninitiate, boring for anyone else. This is a very,very basic book on military hand to hand combat which reads more like a Readers Digest article than a true handbook. The martial arts heritage spiced with some photos of military units training in hand to hand combat and some big size drawings of basic strikes, throws and some disarming moves taken from military manuals and martial arts books makes up most of the content. If this would truly be the ""Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat"" than give God that our Green Berets never run out of Ammo. If you want something for real life buy the Krav Maga book."
2,not so good,"I must admit I was rather disappointed with this book. It seems to waste a lot of time on history and background rather than discussing actual techniques in detail. If you're seriously interested in unarmed combat techniques and self defense, a book like ""Complete Krav Maga"" or ""Get Tough"" is a much better bet."
4,This can be used for street or combat situations,"I found this book to be very educating, it has the style of fighting techniques and survival for the street person or in combat situations,it shows how to unarm a person with a weapon, how to survive a knife weilding assasilant, I have read the book over and over again, and bring it with me in work outs, just so I can practice the manuevers, I highly recommend this book."
4,combat handbook,bought this book on all the reviews that i read about..a no nonsense book about fighting skills .very pleased with the book .
5,Excellent,"A very solid album, definitely reccomended for fans of guitar metal in the Yngwie vein. Great, heavy songwriting. Excellent guitar work & quality vocals. Go get it."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"This relative unknown is praised by Yngwie Malmsteen. His playing style definitely similar, Byrd is a weak songwriting and it shows here. Soloing constantly through the first 4 songs, he doesn't lay down any foundation riffs. Things do pick up after track 5 Death(Is), and that makes up for side 1. A really good cover of Hendrix's Dolly Dagger and the song Lighting The Sky is good, Byrd proves worthy of a listen. Those fans of this kind of music will be interested. Uli-John Roth and Malmsteen"
5,"Harsh truths for Sandinistas, Contras -- and Americans","I was a foreign correspondent in Nicaragua for much of the period covered by Kinzer's book. Typically, American correspondents came and went every couple of years; Kinzer was there before the victory of the 1979 revolution and stayed to the end of a most bloody chapter in this country's history. I do not believe anyone has captured better the strange, almost surreal beauty of this land nor the full horror of the bloodbath it had suffered by the end of the 1980s. Those looking for finger-pointing and the moral of the story will be disappointed; but what Kinzer depicts is the truth, a harsh one for all involved."
4,Fairly objective look at revolution in Nicaragua,"Good comprehensive book on the causes and outcomes of Revolution in Nicaragua. Does a pretty good job of not taking sides. Kinzer was bureau chief in Nicaragua for the New York Times during the 80's. He sheds light on alot of the hypocricies and contraditions the CIA, Contras and Sandinistas were all guilty of.Not for the Radical Sandinista or Reactionary Conservative"
4,journalist perspective of the war in Nicaragua,"Overall this was a good detailed read about the Sandinista revolution and the contra war from a New York Times journalist's viewpoint. He spread the blame around to about all parties involved.There is minimal info on pre-Sandinista revolution history.Author sprinkles the book with a few pages patting himself on the back, regarding peripheral journalistic acomplishments, but these can be skimmed over or forgiven.I wish all history books would contain a couple of pages with the timeline of important events. Like most books, this one does not."
2,Go back to the real deal!,"I was disappointed with Zero Red. It's sort Wingman-light. I realize writing an ongoing series can be a difficult proposition, but this was like reading a rejected Wingman plot line.Mack/Brian, I'll read the Chopper Ops series because I like your style. But, please go back to Hawk! And, while you're at it, get him back to the real/unreal world from which he came.Barring that, bring on Colonel Ryder!"
3,Big disappointment,"The battery does not hold a charge for an EXTENDED period as I had hoped. I was not disappointed in the shipping, however, The order arrived quickly and was well packaged."
1,i never got it,no comment i waited for this product for 2 months i never got it end up getting refund from the store i got charged for shipping and 15% for restocking I'll never use this store again
1,BAD GUN!!!,"This gun is probably the worst gun ive bought, it wouldnt even last 3 weeks. doesnt have a hop up, the stock is not collapsable. the laser would easily break and is also not accurate. its gravity fed so it wouldnt have that realistic feel to it. after about a week the gun would often jam than it WILL break. probably the only good thing about this gun is the fact that i bought it for about $15.00. it states on other websites that its about 210 fps, its really about 100 fps. i do not recommend buying this gun."
3,For Kids,"This Airsoft gun (plastic BB's) is for kids in there low teens who want to have some fun, but not cost a fortune.It has everthing, laser sights, flashligh, etc. and a gravity feed system that sometimes jams.Not to bad though. Money is the question; how much for how much more."
3,The mezuzah in the madonna's foot,"this was required for a book club. It was not what i expected. The information was interesting and answered many historical questions, but the author's style was not gripping. I will donate it as a reference book to a local religious institution."
4,uncovering a new world,wonderful revelation of a subculture... and a new angle on the history of Spain and its Jews. A hard-to-put-down book.
1,Old -Fashioned Clothes Pins Don't Pin,"These old fashioned clothes pins are too small to do any good for real laundry use. They break when you try to use them. They are too expensive for what they are used for and you can buy them at your local hardware store for about 2.00 dollars. Wouldn't buy these again, not to mention that the shipping was more that the product."
1,Bad clothes pins,"I thought these clothes pins were small.And made very poorly. I bought them witha clothesline which I love, but they shippedseparately and for a ridiculous fee. Notworth it at all."
4,livin in the bottle,"While I didn't give it five stars, I still think this is one of the better cds I've heard. The bottle is the funkiest track, period. I just bought it, being a fan of Donald Byrd, Roy Ayers, and Bobby Humphrey, and it hasn't disapointed. The man's voice is crazy, and his poetry on watergate blues is flawless. A must own for fans of this type of music. People who don't like this music just haven't heard it or givin it a chance."
5,An unsung and nearly forgotten hero of political satire,"I was in college when I first heard Gil Scott Heron, we were both yound black and angry. Over the years we have both aged and tempered our anger with knowledge and wisdom. Yet the messages in those poems\songs have not diminished not lost their sharpness over these decades. That was\is the true genius of this man that his poetry is still as relevant today as it was 30 years ago. Today's Rappers and Hip Hoppers' all owe a debt to Gil Scott for he was the forerunner of modern rap. Although the form may sound the same Gil Scott has nothing in common with todays rappers who's lyrics only speak to the lowest common denominator of the black experience. Whenever I want to remember what it felt like to be young,committed and an idealist, I put on Gil Scott Heron and remember *Tomorrow is a Better Day"". Let us not forget this man and his music for Gil Scott Heron is truly a national treasure that should be preserved."
5,This one will creep up on you,"After the Mahavishnu orchestra broke up, I needed to hear more from those four musicians. Jerry's music was so totally different from his Mahavishnu work that I put this CD back on the shelf for a couple of months. When I finally pulled it out again [I was planning on giving it away], I marveled at his classical layering of the instruments. The compositions [not songs] are interspersed with odd time signatures that nudge you off balance and keep the dream-like themes from putting you to sleep. This is one of those select few CD's that will force you into small claims court if anyone dares to scratch it."
5,So good I bought it twice,"I was given this on a cassette tape in 1985, then bought it on CD and just recently lost it (after two moves) so I had to buy it again. It is unlike any other album I have and is extremely good. The time signatures are often not standard; the instruments are different than expected, and the music actually makes me want to sing along, even though it is instrumental! I would love to find more music like this."
4,This album is great.,"Mr. Godfrey had me at first listen. His voice is his biggest selling point. He is raw and honest, that comes through in this album and makes his sound and message all the more 'touching'. Kudos."
3,Intriguing,"The book presents many highly intriguing issues, unfortunately, as the authors themselves admit in the foreword, many are just speculative, based on rumors without substantiation, and some are outright wrong. One needs to remember that the book was written half a century ago and, just like Sci-Fi from those days, some statements will appear naiive.Some ""mysteries"" had been known to be fabrications even at the time of writing the book, yet they had been included.It seems Erich von Danniken drew heavily from this book when writing Chariots of the Gods.Overall, it is a good summer reading and a lot of food for thought, as long as one remembers not to believe everything that is printed."
3,interesting insight into Hitlers occult vision,"I was able to find a used copy on the internet. The book is very interesting but not an easy read. Maybe that is due to the translation from French? I searched this book out for its essays on the Hitler SS Occult, etc. Enjoyed this portion of the book VERY much, Otherwise the book is a bit tedious to read. Other subjects; such as lost civilizations, suppressed knowledge, etc. might be covered better by other current books/authors."
2,Paper is patient,"Two asinine brains got together and wrote fiction of the most sinister kind. The problem is they have faint ideas of historical facts, so they are using a blossoming phantasy. The book is filled with dark energy, and they mock the intelligence of the reader. I combed through the pages, and tried other pages, always the same. Anybody can write a book like this, drink a few glasses of wine and start fabricating. They have a sickening fascination with the third Reich, with Tibet, with Haushofer, void of facts. Their sickening fascination with everything hellish knows no boundaries."
4,Morning of the magicians,"Great book, read it years ago and still looking for someone who sells it. Someone stole it form the library.It is about alchemy, hidden knowledge, and the promise that people with real knowledge are keeping it from the people who would abuse it.I agree, partially fiction, partially fact.A very Very interesting read. Amazon please supplythis book (I have been looking here since 1998)In the meantime, Amazon or visitors, please tell me where I CAN buy it > captain_dimitri@hotmail.com"
2,Bad design,My main complaint is that the middle space doesn't connect with the back so there's a space for things in there to fall down into the drawer and then the drawer doesn't open easily. Similiar problem with the back compartment (doesn't go all the way down so smaller things in the two sides can go way in the back and be hard to get out.) It just seems like it wasn't designed very well. It is nice looking. Anything else I looked at with a similiar design was plastic.
3,really great large drip pan,I needed a very large drip pan for my 1984 chevy van. They are much large then today's vans. It's a one ton van. This van is important to me because it was my deceased father's. Thank YOU
4,"Einstein on Convictions, Science, Peace, Socialism, etc.","Einstein was not just a famous scientist. As this book reveals, he was also a profound and well-written author. The essays in this collection are enlightening, easily understood, and brief but to the point. I would recommend this book to everyone."
5,Incredible!,"Being a musician myself, I think I am even more blown away than most people would be by this CD. These people play more fluently in 7/8 time and 5/4 time than most musicians can play in 4/4 time! And unlike most rock-based odd-time signatures, the rhythms are not contrived at all. They feel completely organic and genuine. Beautiful and expressive soloing combined with metronomic precision - it's any musician's dream! In particular, I thought the 5/4 ballad was one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a long while. Atilla is a brilliant percussionist and arranger. And every single player is a virtuoso. This CD is a must for everyone! Happy listening, Josh"
4,Great Family Pool,"This is a great ""starter pool"" The diamater is perfect for the whole family to enjoy. The depth isn't scary for little kids, but isn't deep enough for any ""real"" swimming by a bigger kid or adult.Set up was easy. Just make sure you have ALL protrusions removed from the area in which you will be setting up the pool. Once we started filling with water we found more, even though we thought we found them all! So be forewarned!Filling took MUCH longer than suggested on the box, but we still swam the weekend of purchase.The filter is worthless, except to disolve chlorine tablets. You will still need to skim and vaccuum REGULARLY even with a cover.Next year we are going to get a deeper version because we love the product!"
5,Nice.,Very talented guy. Great sounds and lyrics. He writes his own songs! Can't wait for his next album. Highly recommend.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this ring a couple of months ago for everyday wear. At first it was great- cute, unique, etc. Then I noticed the latch getting snagged in EVERYTHING, from my clothes to blankets to my bag... After a while, the very poorly made latch became bent out of shape, and now does not close properly.The ring itself is made nicely enough, and is a very cute design. However, the latch is way too pliant and easily bent. The hook on the top will get caught on any stray thread. I would not recommend this ring for everyday use- maybe as a formal or costume piece to be worn every once in a while."
4,"A good, solid, well-researched work","Maude's is probably the most authoritative work on the 1806 Campaign published in the English language. Obviously, it does not go into the subject matter in the same depth as the French and German General Staffs, but Maude drew extensively on this material and made it available to the monolingual reader.His account is largely balanced and Maude shows a deep understanding of the issues surrounding this campaign.Muade is certainly more authoritative than his contemporary Petre and the quality of his work has yet to be surpassed by anybody writing in the English language."
5,Wonderful book and great addition for relevant courses,"I can't say enough good things about this book, and the heroes within it. If you want inspiration, it is here. If you want to get energized to fight for the environment, you will find it within the pages of this book. I use it in my courses to bring hope to my students, which are otherwise doom and gloomed by our current environmental conditions. There is plenty of that in this book, but the hope within it makes it quite different from other similar works. It has my highest recommendation."
2,NOT WHAT I REMEMBERED AS A YOUNG TEENAGER,This isn't what I remembered as a kid. For some reason I remember really enjoying this CD and for many years I remembered the name and decided to order it. I was disappointed.
4,ADDICTION To The Voice Of Rock,"Fourth release by former Deep Purple singer, Glenn Hughes, is one that displays the many dimentions of Glenn's powerful voice. Consider by many as ""The God Of Voice"", Hughes delivers and solid rock and roll performance that will simply blow you away! 'Addiction', features songs that talk about the painful troubles that those with chemical addictions go through. Songs like, ""I Don't Want To Live This Way Again"", a slow bluesy number that Hughes sings with such intensity and feel its scary. Another song that will grab your throat from the get go is the mid-tempo mover, ""Cover Me"". One thing is for sure, once you listen to, 'Addiction', there is no way you can help but be addicted to the powerful and soulful voice of Glenn Hughes."
4,"With Glenn, Heavier is Better","This is my favorite of Glenn's solo albums. It's the most agressive. It's not the kind of album I listen to over and over, but it's great to play once in a while. Holds my attention all the way through, unlike a couple of his other albums."
2,"Too metallic, too aggressive, too modern...","This is very metallic and aggressive, but not in the same musical vein as Slipknot or even the modern Judas Priest. Personally I'm not too happy with this rather hard and heavy low-key direction, and I believe that both the earlier ""From now on"" and the more recent project with Joe Lynn Turner is so much better. But if you like this release I strongly suggest you try to get hold of a copy of the officially unreleased Tony Iommi's ""Eight star"" - the follow up the Black Sabbath album ""Seventh star"" on which Hughes did the vocals. It sounds very much like this one. It might be rather difficult to get, but Ebay might be of help."
3,New Respect for Brown,"John McPhee's books are always fascinating and always teach you things about subjects you didn't know you wanted to know more about. My favorite section in the book was about UPS - one thing I learned is that UPS no longer stands for United Parcel Service - it is just UPS - it isn't short for anything now. Also many items sent off for repairs are being repaired at the UPS facility in Elizabethtown, Kentucky by UPS employees, not by employees of the company you think you are sending the item to. I now have a new respect for Brown."
3,Uncommon,"I've enjoyed many of John McPhee's book, but wasn't as engaged with this one as the others. It was easy to read a little at a time."
3,Good to the last page...,"...in which McPhee takes a gratuitous, unnecessary, and childish (veiled) swipe at a political figure he dislikes personally. John, if you want to do political commentary, write an op-ed."
1,Unreadable Kindle Font,"I think it is a good book, but the quality of the text on the Kindle edition is so bad I can't get through it after several attempts. Looks like a very bad scan. Have tried it on my Kindle, on the PC software, and the iPad app - same results. Changing the size doesn't help either. Very odd - have read dozens of books on Kindle, this is the first one like this where the quality of the transfer got in the way.So I am buying the print version."
4,Fascinating!,"The collected works of the former New Yorker writer. Interesting, entertaining, and informative. I'll never eat lobster again after reading about the lobster warehouses. Yikes! I hope they never escape."
4,Nice Surprise,"I thought I did all the research possible to find the right camcorder. After searching online I had firmly decided on the Panasonic PV-L750. I wanted a camcorder with the still picture feature. When I got to the electronics store, the clerk persuaded me towards this RCA model. It was lighter, smaller, has a higher zoom and had a clearer picture. Although I initially thought he was just trying to talk me into a higher priced item, I chose the RCA. I am very pleased with this camcorder...and it's my first! At the store where I bought it, the Panasonic was a little cheaper, but keep in mind that it does not come with the VHS converter. Purchasing it separately would have made it actually made the Panasonic more expensive. I'm having a great time with my camcorder and I love being able to download and email pictures on my computer."
2,Singer 00269,"Item is smaller than I thought when I was looking at the picture. There is hardly any thread and it is wrapped around a paper spool but I guess for the money, what could I expect."
2,Not really all that useful,"Is the price worth it? I think not. The only thing I've used in the kit was the scissors (which was the only thing really useable). The needles were small and fragile and you get very little thread. The needle threaders don't even work. It's like a thin wire has been elmer-glued to some aluminum foil. Anything that requires a little yank will make it fall apart. If you want a traveling sewing kit, I'd advise you look elsewhere. If you're new to sewing and want something unthreatening, then this is what you want. I doubt the needles are even sharp."
4,good one,I ordered it because I was looking for a small sewing kit to be used during travel. I found this product with an amazing price
4,The Fascinating World of Economics Explained,"""All over the world government officials are creating so much money that the money is losing its value. Prices are rising almost everywhere."" ~ pg. 29If you love reading books where you constantly are saying: ""Wow, I didn't know that!"" then this book will be very entertaining. It is really a series of letters written by an uncle to his nephew. Of course it is Richard Mayberry writing the letters but it is fun to pretend otherwise. Basically Richard Mayberry explains money, inflation, recessions, depressions, government, ethics, unemployment, poverty, business failure, legal systems and taxes. I found this book to be brilliant in its simplicity. Just remember this book was published in 2004 so it doesn't have some of the more current information you may want to read about. Still it is an excellent and quick read.~The Rebecca Review"
5,Whatever happened to penny candy?,The book is awesome? Every high school student should be reading and studying from this book! It puts economics in easy to understand terms even for the teacher.
5,"Even better than ""Economics In One Lesson""","I think this is the best book out there to help quickly spread a basic understanding of economics and therefore how the world works. The knowledge and importance per page ratio is the highest I have ever read. Even better than Harry Browne's intro to economics from his famous first 80 pages of ""How you can profit from the coming devaluation"" .Pages 13 - 90 are the heart of the book. That is 77 pages that in less than 2 hours can take your average person from unfortunate ignorance to economic genius compared to your average economics college graduate.Somehow someone needs to reach Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and get them to read this book and put a copy in every american household. That would really be the most charitable thing they could do."
4,Excellent Entry into Economics,"This author explains the economics in a simplified form, starting with it's history and quickly brings the reader up to modern day. This is an excellent introduction into economics for people wanting a basic understanding as well as providing references to expand on advanced topics."
4,Great primer,"This is one of our children's home school curriculum books. The author wrote this book about economics and inflation for teenagers, but I heartily endorse it for adults as well. I've never read such a simplified version of what is normally considered a dry topic and complex. The book is also endorsed by a former U.S. Secretary of Treasury and others. While I don't agree with everything the author states, his material is 99% accurate. I've read a lot of books and papers on economics, inflation and capitalism in the past and this is one of the best."
5,Whatever Happened to Penny Candy?,Excellent book about where money got started in the Roman empire and how it also killed the empire because of government greed. Sound familiar? A MUST read for every American citizen - easy too!
3,Very Biased,"As a Monarchist, I found this book rather biased toward the Natural Law/Ron Paul-ism sweeping America.The writer failed to realize the founder of Roman Law (ie the Roman Empire) laster for almost 2000 years! If Roman Law is so bad, and destabilizing, then how is that possible.He contradicts himself, at first blaming ethics for inflation, then bringing in the Natural/Roman Law Dynamic, and blaming Roman Law for inflation because it lacks ""ethics"".Tell that to the Byzantine Roman Empire with almost 1000 years of existence after the sack of Rome. Tell that to the Germanic Holy Roman Empire with another 1000 years under its belt. Heck, the Holy Roman Empire collapsed only 200 years ago. The Roman Empire has been around since 32BC!"
2,If it was strictly about the Wives it would have given it 5 stars,"The show is filmed like your typical reality show. The wives are very fascinating in the way they live and the way they function, it really makes you understand the lifestyle they've chosen.But Cody is a creep, he seems like man child that can't decide which toy to play with today. He doesn't seem to really contribute to the workings of the family, and he is really creepy and a bit of a photo bomb when it comes to other people, he is constantly waving or jumping into a scene so that you know he's there."
1,it is against the law,"these women might as well be in a hip hop video with no clothes on since they are being paraded around as a spectical.this family is not an interesting family to watch.... white yes, different yes, no way."
1,Appalling!,"I am totally appalled at what is on tv nowadays. Even though they are not really polygamous, they call themselves polygamous. Need I remind everyone that polygamy is illegal. This is not reality tv, this is just wrong living. I could care less what people do in the privacy of their homes but please, everyone, try to keep trash like this off of the media. I think they all need psychiatrists. Don't kids have a bad enough time trying to live without having to see this crap?"
1,"Brush head too big, bristles too hard","As another reviewer explained, the head on the brush is too large to fit comfortably in your mouth and the bristles are way too hard. I could not even finish brushing my teeth when I tried to use it because it was so uncomfortable. Plus it comes in a plastic container (not marked as recyclable) which is not helpful if you are buying this product to reduce your plastic consumption. I would instead recommend the Brooks Pearwood Boar Bristle, a very similar product in the same price range that has a smaller head and much softer bristles."
3,Very Good Product....Bad Advertising,"The toothbrush is great; however, the presentation is misleading. I had no idea I was only ordering one toothbrush. The picture gives the impression that there were five (5) toothbrushes in the package."
2,why do they even MAKE toothbrushes this STIFF??,"Not impressed with the stiffness of the bristles, it literally feels like I am brushing my teeth with a wire brush meant for cleaning a BBQ. NO JOKE. Ick! Design is nice, if not HUGE, but I just can't get past the bristles. I bought these to replace my Brooks brand toothbrush (http://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Pearwood-Boars-Bristle-Toothbrush/dp/B000VUYQOA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330245229&sr=8-1)which was perfect and was not so stiff but I think I will be going back to them after all (I actually found them on another website for much cheaper but I cant remember the name of the site so will have to go searching for it again I guess.) My only real regret is I bought one for each in my family. Unless I want my kids to be scarred for life I will not be giving these to them or they might avoid tooth brushing forever. OY, live and learn...."
4,Natural Toothbrush,"Good product for those who may be allergic or sensitive to plastic toothbrushes. If you normally use a soft brush, order the medium in the natural brushes as they wear quicker and the bristles soften easily."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this was a pack of toothbrushes because of the picture. Probably(?) they say somewhere in the description that there's only 1 toothbrush for the price, but I didn't see it. And yeah, I can definitely say the price is fair, for a nice wooden toothbrush; it's just not what I thought I was buying. The picture is totally misleading.Also, the bristles are SUPER hard! I would use this toothbrush to clean a carburetor, not my teeth. My husband says he likes it, so he's using it now, but I'm kinda worried he's going to ruin his gums on it."
3,It is real wood!,"I really like the concept of this product. The bristles are quite stiff, and it wasn't clear to me that I was one purchasing ONE toothbrush and not a box. I would have bought it anyway, but I would have bought the box. Not sure if I will purchase again."
1,boring,"most people who watch star-trek think Spocks Brain is the worst episode of the original series. Wink of an eye IS truly the worst, it's boring it makes no sense and just drags and drags and drags"
3,The Rest of the Story,"Mark Littleton has written several books in the Zondervan Sports Heroes series. Each book follows a similar format: brief, standard biographies of the sports career of 6 or 7 athletes with an added touch ala Commentator Paul Harvey's ""The Rest of the Story.""The added touch is how each individual athlete found that his/her faith in God made him/her a more complete human being, if not a more perfect competitor.Sadly, many of the books are out of print, but may be available in libraries or through special services of Amazon or other booksellers.I recommend these books for both parents and their preteens and teens to read. The torn social framework created by over-competitive parents living vicariously through their athlete-children cries out for repair with a strong dose of the faith found by each of Mr. Littleton's subjects.The moral is ""You can be a pretty good athlete or even a star WITHOUT being a jerk!"""
3,I NEED MORE!,"THIS IS THE MOST UNDERATTED ALBUM IN PRIORITY RECORDS HEYDAYS. I CAN'T FIND ANY OTHER MUSIC BY THEM EXCEPT 1 OTHER SONG ON A COMP. CD THAT IS MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLD. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE I CAN FIND SOME MORE MUSIC BY THESE GUYS LET ME KNOW. HASTA, AND DRINK OLD ENGLISH"
4,Know your product before you buy your product!,"Yes, the previous reviews are true! This product does have some quirky flaws that need to be ironed out. I occasionally use this keyboard (twice a week) so I'm more than happy to go through the struggles that accompany it. If I used it on a daily basis, I believe it would drive me crazy. Read the previous reviews, know what you're getting, and be happy if you decide to purchase. I did, and now I'm just happy to not have to use the stylus to input all of my information!"
2,I couldn't get it to work,Looks cool. The manufacturer said it could work. I couldn't make it happen. Maybe you can. good luck. I have iPAQ 4350. Had to return it. Beware if you buy one.
3,It works but...,"The sensor installed and worked OK. Make sure you have the special 7/8"" socket with the slot in the side in order to remove the old one. This O2 Sensor is not exactly as pictured, it deos not have the metal spring cable support on top of the sensor. I wonder how long it will hold up since the cable is not supported very well and seems to be a bit shorter than the original."
4,The part worked for us!,"Our caravan didn't pass inspection because the 02 sensor needed to be replaced. It was not complicated to switch it out ourselves, just very time consuming because it is in an extremely difficult to reach place. However, after removing the old 02 sensor (took the longest), this new one went in quickly and was an exact fit. We passed inspection the next day and it saved us the cost of labor at a repair shop. It seems to be of good quality, was easy to work with, but did not come with instructions at all (bumped a star for this reason) - we used the auto repair database available from our public library for that, and a great video from youtube showing how to remove and reinstall an 02 sensor from a guy and his young sons. One note: you have to drive your vehicle about 30 miles (1-2 drive cycles) for the OTC code to reset and for the 02 sensor to give a new reading, which was important for us to do before we took it for reinspection."
3,"A wealth of info, with a Final Cut bias.","A wealth of important and useful information. However, AVID editors will find not one word in this book about preparing material and exporting from AVID systems to DVD Studio Pro 4. It's bias is Final Cut, which is the default standard for this guide"
4,over all pretty good deal,"Bought ""a collection of great dance songs"" by the pink floyd and it showed up in a timely manner which other than the quality of the product, that is the most important thing. It did have a slight bow to the record and its sleeve upon arrival but the price that was paid was a big enough bargain as it was. So all is well..."
5,Works well,I got this for my (non technical) brother in law. he was able to install his old laptop harddrive into it and get it to work in 10 minutes.
5,Works great! Very easy to use!,"Our old laptop was dropped (oops!), and we needed to get the data off the hard drive. We installed the hard drive into this case, plugged it into our new computer via USB, and voila! All of our files were retrievable. We now can use the old hard drive as a backup drive, or drive to move large files from one computer to another. I recommend this case!"
1,bad merchandise,I bought 2 of these HD enclosures recently. Both failed. One got so hot it melted the glue that holds the electronics to the chassis. Both rapidly ceased to work at all.
4,Gets the job done,"My two windows machines BOTH had problems reading the drive, however my Linux machine picked it up right away - no issues. Able to get all my data off an ancient laptop harddrive."
5,Cheap Lifesaver,"You can't really beat the price of this thing for the chance to recover your data. My laptop mobo fried. Luckily, my most important files were backed up, but there were still some on the laptop I wanted if I could get them easily, and this enclosure made that happen. Popped the hard drive out of the dead laptop, slide it into this enclosure, closed the cap, which pushes into the IDE pins, and plugged the usb into my tower. I immediately got full access to both partitions on my hard drive. The whole process literally took 5 minutes from UPS showing up to all my files being transfered successfully.Cheap, simple, and it works. Not to mention, I've now got a tiny portable 80GB hard drive that I can use until it stops working from being shaken around too much. What more can you ask for?"
2,cheap - does the job,The drive is functional. The screws to attach the USB end (plastic cap) to the aluminum case were missing. I had to wrap electrical tape around it to keep it together. The drive works though and it was cheap.
1,Dont buy this item,"Received this in order to backup a dead laptop's hard drive. None of my computers recognize it (laptop with XP, another with 7, and a Mac). This is a piece of junk and despite the ease of installing the new drive in the housing, it doesnt do any good. Pay a little more and get a more reliable one."
3,SUPER CHEAP CHEAP,"This product is affordable. it arrived with all parts and some (extra screw was nice). The instructions are horrible. Drive is slow and USB port was rusted and/or corroded. comes with tools too! I was expecting at the price just the enclosure and nothing else (except a decent manual which is mandatory).Pro: affordable, comes with partsCon: you get what you paid for, Damaged port, Piss poor user manualTip: Dont use this for important data. This is not for back up."
1,Terrible - avoid this product,"Cheap, cheap product. No air flow, case was damaged on delivery and had to stuff the HD into the case, scratching the unit up on all sides. I got what I paid for (cheapest one in the list) - go for a unit with airflow."
1,misleading,This item does not have the right adapters for laptop hard drives or internal hard drives for desktop computers either unsure of what kind of hard drive it even connects to. I would deff not recomend this product to anyone.
2,Interface is IDE,I bought 2 thinking this would work for my two SATA drives and found out the interface was IDE. Rating it 2 stars for not listing the interface on the tech specs. No idea if the product works as intended.
4,Gets the job done.,"My buddy had great music on his old dell laptop, but i hated having to plug a screen into it every time we wanted to access it. When i pulled out his hard drive i noticed it was already a legacy drive with IDE. Thankfully amazon carried this enclosure. I wouldn't say it was top notch stuff here but it did do the job. The side screws could have been worked a little better, this is a 1st indication that it is cheaply made.I noticed on the picture that it came in a box, mine came in a bag? But all the materials you get for less then $6 is a bargain. I'd say go for it if you need to access files that you need to obtain. But if i were you copy it to something more reliable and sturdy."
3,Check for specification,HDD Enclosures are always confusing as there are so many available in the market with so different ways of connecting peripheral/auxiliary devices. I went through a large list of HDD Enclosures and after couple of days purchased this item - waited for couple of days only to find out that this enclosure does not fit my internal hard disk. The board had some soldering blemishes but never had a chance to test the connectivity. The build looks pretty ok and it was a great ide to include the screw driver as part of the package - It was really helpful. Be sure of what Hard disks you are using - SATA is common these days. I ended up buying a SATA to USB cable that served the purpose of transferring data from my old hard disk to a newer one. This product may be good for the price advertised but ensure that this one serves the purpose. This would fit only HDD of laptops cos its 2.5inch and would not work with the bigger solid state drives - the ones which are normally used for desktop
3,"It works, but is very flimsy","The device works, but you have to be careful with it. The IDE connection is not very deep and doesn't seem to be reliable. On the top of that, IDE connection is the only thing that hold the drive inside the case. While I am moving around with enclosure, I can hear the hard drive rattling inside.The Enclosure is OK for the stationary setup, but would not work for any mobile tasks."
2,Enclosure has flaws,"I have had this case for over two months now and have tried to get it work on five different computers. One time a laptop saw the enclosed hard drive but nothing since. The light comes on to indicate it has power, I connected it to the USB ports on the computers themselves, but still, nothing. I have ruled out the hard drive being the issue because I have since purchased another external case and have had no further issues. Either mine was very, very broken, or as a trend this is a faulty product. Buy at your own risk!"
4,Does The Trick,"I bought this casing to house the old 20GB hard drive I retrieved out of my old laptop that died a while back. I did not need to recover any files (although I clearly could have recovered everything), I just thought I might as well use the drive for external storage. It works perfectly for that!Comes with 2 teeny weeny screws & a small screwdriver. Slightly awkward to NOT drop the screws & loose them!"
4,Does a good job,was able to get the info from my old laptop harddisk. Cheap and does a fine job. The installation was also easy.
5,It's cheap and it works,"I had upgraded my Titanium Powerbook's HD and had that spare 2.5"" drive sitting around. Why not turn it into an external? This product did the trick.It isn't perfect. You should be a little computer savvy to install your old HD and get it working. The manual-- well, avoid it, it's worse than useless. But all the parts went together smoothly and the rather odd A-to-A-to-A USB cable let it work with my Windows and Macintosh systems.The little screwdriver is completely useless, though; if you do any computer work you should have a set of tiny Philips-head screwdrivers anyway.In short, the device helped me easily transfer my old drive's contents to a new drive, and also gives me an external disk that doesn't have to be plugged in to a power strip. It's built well enough to handle most physical abuse, but is somewhat on the difficult side to set up. Once you do that, though, you're good.And did I mention that the price can't be beat?"
1,Avoid this device - seller ok,"External enclosure worked for less than 2 minutes. Even during those 2 minutes the device would drop then reconnect. Return postage would cost more than the case.Bluemall, aka BargainCell, is a good seller though."
1,"Worthless junk, won't install drivers","Don't bother with this junk. I tried this on both a Win 7 Pro 64 bit and Vista Home Premium 32 bit machine. Neither would install the drivers, so this device never showed up under My Computer. Therefore, it's worthless as you can't access anything on your hard drive. There is no manufacturer listed on the package, and since no name is given the drive under device manager, you can't even go search for a driver anywhere. I even tried to manually install it as a generic USB mass storage device and that also failed. Oh well, it's only $5 wasted. Don't waste your $5 and buy this garbage. I'd give it zero stars if that were an option."
3,One Time Use,This product is not for you if your going to use this as you primary portable hard dive. The only use for this enclosure is to retrieve data from another HDD.The solder joints are weak and look like their about to break.This product is not going to last very long so get a this is not for you if your going use it long term.
3,drive didn't quite fit,"Apparently, not all 2.5"" laptop drives are the same, or perhaps what i have isn't exactly a 2.5"" drive (IBM Travelstar, DCXA-210000, out of an old Dell laptop(?)). It didn't fit in the aluminum case... real close, but no cigar. Maybe if this drive had ever so slightly rounded edges along it's length it would fit.Fortunately, this is acceptable for my needs. It electronically edge-connected to my drive & provides the USB2.0 interface, but i do have to leave the drive out of the case, naked / exposed. O-well. 'Works.Karl*----->"
2,NOTE IDE connection,"The price was very reasonable. However, the distinction between a SATA connector and IDE connector is stated in the description, but was not clear from the title resulting in me purchasing the wrong item. An inexpensive learning experience!"
1,Save Your Money,"If you want an aluminum enclosure this will do. But forget establishing a connection between IDE/USB.If your lucky it might work. It may not. The problem with this enclosure and the reason why it sells so cheap is that it does not come with a seperate 5V power supply. Does not even have a jack for it. If you connect say a 160G Drive that requires more current than is available from a USB connection, it will not work and there is no work around, such as bringing additional power. If you connect a small drive that does not require much current and your computer can provide enough power you lucked out. It may or may not work. Nice product huh? My suggestion is that the enclosure works the rest is just luck. DON'T buy this one. Pay the money and get one that comes with power like a NextStar 3, there are others."
1,tried on multiple computers could not get any to recongize it!,First this enclosure is very cheaply made. Second I couldn't even get my computer to recongize it at all. Don't waste your time and buy a better enclousure like the Eagle Tech Mesh IDE Enclousure which is what I got iEagle Tech ET-CS2MU2-BK 2.5-Inch IDE to USB Portable HDD Enclosure (Mesh)and I love it
4,Exactly as advertised I guess,"Ordered this product and it was quickly shipped. It was exacely as it was advertised. Unfortunately it does not work with the hard drive out of my busted HP Pavillion Entertainment PC. (fewer pins, inserted from bottom) Thought I checked everything out, but apparently I didn't. I still need an enclosure Again, product was exactly as advertised, shipping was fast and I will use this for an older laptop HDD I have."
1,Doesn't fit hard drive from HP laptop,"This enclosure does not work with HP laptop hard drive. It does not have the same connections as the hard drive, so you cannot use it to transfer files from your hard drive. Staples has an enclosure that works perfectly. It is more expensive, but the hard drive fits right into it and works great."
2,NOT a SATA Enclosure,"This shows up in searches for SATA enclosures, I'm assuming because there's a bundle including a SATA enclosure with this. It's a PATA / IDE enclosure! I've found this has been happening more on Amazon. Search results with results ALMOST right. I fell for it this time :(Gave it to a friend and he commented the end caps didn't have holes to insert the screws to secure them.The good thing is it's cheap enough that it's not a great loss. Not worth sending back."
4,Not Bad For the Money,"This probably wouldn't be my first choice for a permanent installation, but for a temporary solution it was perfect. I bought this to help a friend recover files from a computer that refused to boot. He needed to recover files before a Windows re-install. This did the job perfectly.Why not a permanent solution? First off, the case is really thin and cheap. (And plain aluminum, not blue.) Secondly, with my ham hands, I would never be able to put those tiny screws in to permanently secure it, and Mrs. Boilermate said she would have trouble with them, too. My enclosure didn't come with any instructions, but none were needed.So for less than six bucks it did the job it it was supposed to. However, I would look elsewhere for a more long term solution."
3,"Works well, but not blue","First things first, this enclosure is not blue, as listed. It is silver, and looks very similar to my other enclosure, which causes me some confusion, and is why I bought (or attempted to) a blue one.Otherwise, it works fairly well. Can get a little hot since it lacks fans, but keep it off of any insulating surface and it's fine."
4,Works fine.,"Works just fine and it was inexpensive to boot. If you've got an older notebook ide/pata drive lying around, you should get one of these and put it to use."
4,A real value,I needed to download files from a laptop HD before it went belly-up and this worked like a charm. A true value for the price paid.
2,Worked At First,"Easy to install, but after about 6 months it started only working intermittently. Finally broke around 7 months, hard drive would turn on but not be recognized in any computer I tried it in (included ones that it worked in the day before). I got a silver one for a couple bucks so I guess you get what you pay for, but you are better off just buying a better one. Also the USB Type A as the connector for the hard drive is pretty stupid. Why not just use a miniUSB like every other external drive I have ever seen?"
2,Very Low Quality Product,I bought this to recover data off of a crashed laptop. The drive connected to the interface and was detected in both Windows and Linux with no issues. I was able to recover the data I needed. The enclosure itself is very low quality. The drive connected to the interface with no issues but the holes for the screws didn't line up between the aluminum case and the mounting holes on the plastic piece. I ended up using tape to keep the enclosure together. I do not recommend this product for any long term usage.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I had an issue with placing the hard drive in the enclosure and the reason was that the case and cutout holes for the usb connector did not line up well at all. For the price it works. It just took some messing around before I got it to come together. I thought I was going to break something before I got it to work. Other enclosures I have are easy to swap back and forth. This one I would not swap hard drives because of the difficulty it takes to place them properly. If you are looking for a cheap way to get an ATA 100 interface into a case, this is the buy."
3,it works,"it took me a few extra minutes to plug in my drive and the usb cable came with the drive didn't work at first, but I figure out that problem and now it works great. Quiet, fast and slim.The vendor sent me a replacement usb cable no extra charge.Thx."
3,My only quibble is the cable.,"As an enclosure, it seems to work fine. I knew it was cheap; we'll see how it fares over a period of time.My only quibble is the cable. I don't mind the Y-cable for use with computers that need the extra connection for power. It's the fact that the cable is a nonstandard USB A-A. Almost every other USB drive is A-B or A-mini B. Why does this matter? Because if you lose the cable, it'll be a hassle to replace it. As a consultant I have a lot of external drives, and don't want to worry about keeping specific cables with specific drives."
2,"2.5"" hard drive enclosure","Great price for a product that looks good and built well. Inserted my laptop hard drive easily but cannot get my desktop or laptop to recognize it. Instead i just get the BSOD. Gonna read up on troubleshooting. As of now, its not functional."
5,Delivers what it is meant to be for.,"I already had an IDE casing and it was pathetic. I ordered this to port the hard disc from the old one and it was a easy and simple. The new one works great providing me with the interface to the computer to do the transfer.I have not rated fool-proofing since I didnt know what it really meant.I have marked the reliability as 3 since I have not done extensive operation, planning to install a Ubuntu VM on the same. Let see how it goes."
3,Ugh.,"Well, i have had it for a while and it was working. But then my computer suddenly stopped realizing it was even plugged in. So i tried another computer, and then my laptop, but nothing. I think it may be the driver, but I am just warning you people that you need to be careful."
2,Better options out there,"While the case functions well and the blue color is nice, there are a few drawbacks. First, (and this is my fault for not noticing this) is that the connection on the case is not micro or mini USB. It has a special cable (included) that uses a standard A type plug on both ends. So I can't use on of the dozens existing cables that I use for all other USB drives.The second thing I don't like is how the drive sits in the case. There is no way to secure the drive or have it rest on something int the case. It just plugs into the connector and then slides in the drive. It's not a tight fit so the can wiggle back and forth in the housing. I wouldn't trust it to transport regularly.So it gets the job done but there are better options.Plus it didn't help that it took well over a month for delivery."
3,Goofy connector - ok build,"This drive works as advertised, my issue comes from the fact that the connector on the drive is a USB A connector. This makes things a little tough if you lose the cable - because it isn't easily replaced with either a mini or micro USB end, or the standard USB B connector. I doubt I'll get another one - though once connected it did work as expected."
4,Good product,"It is not something that will last forever I guess but to use for a backup hard-drive it's enough!Connection is good, work well so farGood product considering the price"
2,Simple and a little confusing,"Not sure why this thing has a forked usb connector, maybe I'm not using it right. Anyways, it does work for housing my old hard drive from a crashed dell from around 2005 and connecting it to my new laptop. The usb isn't the most reliable as the cable will come disconnected very easily. Also, the case doesn't fit quite perfectly, but it fits well enough for how cheap it is."
5,good tool to have,I repair/fix friend's laptops and this is an easy way to copy/back up the data before I start the repair. Is also helpful to grab info from a dead laptop.
4,Helpful and Handy,"This product helps, you need to get around to different workstations or working on a repair job this is what you need. It's portable and handy."
3,Does what it needs too,"Like the title says, it does what it needs to and nothing more. I had to et one of these to do a data recovery from my brothers laptop.The case itself is well designed accept for the back plastic cover. It will take some jimmying to get it back on once the harddrive is installed in it. BUT YOU CAN DO IT.Also, don't loose the original usb cable. Its not proprietary but its a cross-over USB.Performs as expected and costs almost nothing compared to the alternatives I've seen in the past"
4,Works Fine,Got the product in time. Works as expected. Met my expectations. Color not as advertised yet was no problem for me.
5,Good for the money,"I don't see any real problems with this case other that cheap construction, but if you don't abuse it, it will be fine. The aluminum case does make a decent heat sink, I have left it running (writing data, not just plugged in) for several hours and it never got overly hot. the only conceivable way that this would over heat is to use it in an insulator (the cheap case that came with it) and not out in the open. Also, this product does not come with hd supports, but you can just rip off a small piece of the box it cam in and shove it in with the hd. it would have been nice if it came with a few extra screws, I dropped one and still can't find it, but just the one screw hold the case together fine."
4,Simple,"Super simple, I only need to write to the drive once in while, as they are used as backups. For the price they work great, in, out done. I ordered two had both done in under, 10 minutes. This is a great way to use old laptop hard drives."
2,Not worth it.,"I was hoping to luck out with a cheap enclosure. But this didn't work at all. The drive inside is unsupported so it can move and rattle around. This is likely to kill any drive fairly quick if its transported. It might be ok to lay on your desk or something. My drive is now stuck inside as well. The screws to hold the enclosure together won't come out. You screw into black plastic and then to get them out you can unscrew forever and it doesn't come back out. I will end up needing to drill the screw out. Ruining the product and my chances of a return and possibly the drive I put inside of this. Oh yeah that's just the physical issues. This also doesn't work at all. When plugged into multiple computers, you can hear the drive spin but nothing is recognized on the computer. Tried multiple programs for disk management. I finally found one that could see it, but any way I tried to use it caused an error message."
3,"OK, but Windows 7 does not like it.","Works fine with Windows XP but unfortunately I bought this to access data on my old drive from a computer using Windows 7. Windows 7 says the drive is invalid and only give me an option to format it. Odd too since the data on the drive was all created in Windows 7. I have not yet tried that because I wanted to pull some data off of it first. I had to connect it to my work computer that uses Windows XP and share over the network to pull data.On a side note: this comes with a USB cord that has three plugs and no instructions at all on which one goes to enclosure, which one is supposed to plug in or if it even matters. One of the plugs is longer and thicker my guess is that one is for USB ports that are further away from where you want to put the drive but then I don't know since there are NO INSTRUCTIONS."
2,Works fine but hard to put together,"This hard drive enclosure works just fine, but it comes with a couple of ridiculous screws that are so unbelievably tiny that there is no way that I could possibly get a grip on them to put them in. The screws are meant to screw the hard drive in place to the enclosure so that the hard drive doesn't move around inside the enclosure.I have never in my life seen screws this small. They're like the size of an eyelash. And if you drop one you can forget about finding it ever again.Since these screws are impossible to use, you will just have to use the hard drive inside the enclosure without screwing it in and securing it.Other than that, the enlosure works OK. You do need two USB ports to plug it in though, not one, in order to provide enough power to the drive."
5,usb hdd enclosure sata,i first ordered the wrong enclosure (ata) but got excellent help from the supplier and shortly received the correct (sata) enclosure that worked perfecly.
3,Cheap and cheaply made,It has teenie-tiny phillips screws to hold in the top. Had to stuff some folded paper down inside because the case is longer than my HD and it kept sliding back and forth. The did supply a little phillips driver for those screws but the head of the supplied driver was way too big for the screws. What a joke. It worked once mounted and modified but it should have some foam or something to account for different length HDs and some click-in type of mounting instead of screws like those that are in your glasses. These screws are going to get lost and screw into plastic directly so eventually will strip out its socket. It does have a nice slip-in case and sleek color.
3,Fairly Good System except no optical connection from cable TV,"This product was easy to set up and install. With a DVD it has pretty good surround sound and appears to be well balanced. The wireless rear speakers work well. One feature which was suprisingly missing, however, was the ability to connect the sound from your digital cable box by means of a fiberoptical connection so that you would get true dolby when the show is broadcast in dolby 5.1."
4,A fun read,"This is a very entertaining book, especially for fans of Emily's poetry. The prose is delicate and gripping, and many times I found myself actually believing that Emily had written these letters.I wouldn't use it is a source for an essay or research project, but if you enjoy Emily's poetry, I recommend giving this one a look."
5,good product,"I have not used yet but compared to the one I have in use is much higher, good drag and less flexible, which adds more power at takeoff. I recommend it for light aircraft and engines 24-09"
4,Learn Massive Amounts Of Cool Techniques,"I bought this book on it's graphics alone, and I was rewarded by my choice. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the tutorials could be a little less confusing. As well as a couple of mistakes that I had to write in the book to remind myself of. Other than that, the price of the book is almost worth it just to get the cd. The actions included are unstoppable. Plus the tutorials, which as I previously stated could be a little clearer, compliment the actions on the disk. Giving you the step-by-step to mimic them(actions). Plus you can amaze and astound your friends with the techniques learned from this book. I definitely recommend it."
3,It's not bad for an effects book,"This book provides examples of how to do certain special effects.It was definitely more of a ""tips and tricks"" book than it was a learning resource. Just follow the steps, and go ""WOW"" just like the title.It doesn't really explain in detail how the trick was done and why you're doing a certain step. Most photoshop gurus will just scoff at this book, and most newbies will walk away amazed, but no smarter about photoshop than before they read it.The latter portions of the book was nothing more than a summary of the different photoshop filters found in commercial filter packages. I question why thoese filters were even in the book; it seemed like advertising that does not benefit the readers."
4,Not for beginners,"I bought this book in order to understand Photoshop a little better. Big Mistake. Don't get this book if you want to learn Photoshop. Some of the stuff was neat, but I had a hard time trying to follow it."
1,One of the most inaccurate portrayals of gamers ever,"This book qualifies as one of the most inaccurate portrayals of gamers and Role-Playing Games ever. Quite simply, gamers are quite able to distinguish between reality and fantasy, unlike as portrayed in this book (even in the portions which are supposed to be realistic)."
1,A Distasteful Story,"Rona Jaffe seems to know very little about roleplaying games and roleplayers and this translates over to her story. It is really sad that she stooped so low in joining an assault on a game, what a shame."
1,"Useless, Unfounded, Unknowledgeable, Claptrap","Wow, yet another attempt to scapegoat yet another subject. When will people stop attempting to blame their problems on outside sources, when the blame for their personal problems rests squarely upon their shoulders, and nowhere else.When people go out and commit murder and blame it on the deity of their world famous relgion, do we hear any calls to ban that religion? No. That would be *ridiculous*. So is everything written in this book from cover to cover."
4,As the title states: a good introduction,"I found this book a good resource for breed-specific information. It contains several mentions of specific problems (in some cases, non-problems) to keep an eye out for in this breed."
2,Pretty good book,"I found this book interesting but a little dry when discussing some topics. I liked the exmples of the dogs pictured. Over all, it was worth reading and looking at the pics, but it took a long time to get through. Could use some more interest-holding sections throughout."
1,Fairly interesting. Nice effort.,"Text is cold and clinical. Could be improved upon with more personal information and experiences. Great looking dogs in the photos, but sure could use more of them."
2,Kuga just doesn't understand,"The good thing is Cain Kuga provides great art for this series. The bad thing is Kuga, as the writer, never grasped the personality or appeal of each character. The subtlety of the anime and the balance of the various personalities aboard the Bobop is lost. The most infuriating is Spike has taken on a whole new personality of stupidity. Instead of a cleverness hidden behind his nonchalant attitude, he has become Bebop's grunt, driven by hunger and little else. There's a reason the manga is being canceled after issue 2."
4,Lovely so far,Fans of the more mature plot and scant sight gags of Cowboy Bebop may be disappointed to learn that this manga has less of the first and more of the second. I for one love it. Its a fresh new take on the franchise and I like how the characters are drawn a lot. The plot seems a little generic a this time but hopefully it'll pick up in the next book.
3,A new take on a great series,"I absolutely loved the anime of Cowboy Bebop. This book is set in the same universe with the same characters. Their stories, however, have changed. The way we meet Ed, Faye, Ein, and the history of Spike and Jet are different based on the author's take on the characters. Some might not like this, but I like the new twist on their relationships. Plus the author has added a whole new badguy! Since the TV series is over, it is also like getting all new Bebop stories. I haven't read the rest in this manga series so I don't know how they continue, but if you are dying for more Spike and don't mind the alternate reality, I highly recommend the book!If you don't want the stories to change, consider picking up the Cowboy Bebop series by Hajime Yadate and Yutaka Nanten, ISBN#1931514917, simply called Cowboy Bebop Book 1 etc. These are more like continuing adventures that take place in between what would have been a TV episode."
1,How do you ruin Cowboy Bebop? This is a big example!,"This series is a retelling of Cowboy Bebop supposedly, except for some reason Cain Kuga destroyed the characterization of everyone. Spike is now much lazier than the original, and lacks the laid back yet serious stature he has in the anime, Ed is now a whiny little brat, and Faye is nothing but a brainless (...) The artwork is ugly to look at... no, the character designs are okay, but the action is drawn so odd that it is impossible to tell what is going on. And the stories themselves are very lacking, they do not have the Bebop feeling that the anime does, and devoid of any characterization. Listen to this review: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID! I've goofed up so none of you will make the same mistake like me!"
4,Worth a look,"Anyone with even a casual interest in the early Ford Broncos will find this book worthwhile. It includes many of the early magazine reviews on the truck, as well as several later ones. The articles hit on each year, which provides a good overview of the Bronco as it changed to fit the times. Plenty of technical information can be found here, including options, engines, specifications, etc. It's not a restoration manual, but rather a historical look back at one of the great SUVs of the 20th century. Check it out!"
3,Early Food Bronco Book,"This book was ok, but I was hoping for more. It's really just goes into the specs and options for each model. It include's production data, units sold, etc. and tha's about it. Pretty much just the facts..."
2,Fundamentals of Structural Analysis,"This book uses notation that is not consistent with other textbooks, which makes it confusing and hard to read. The flexibility method chapter is almost devoid of real substance -- it goes over matrix calculations rather than explaining the theory. However, some of the other chapters (slope deflection method, moment area method) are well executed, even though the book's formating isn't easy on the eyes."
2,Is There A Solutions Manual For This Book!!!!!!!!,Is there a solutions manual for this book. I need it. Please e-mail me. Wooooooo!!!!!!!!
5,Pregnant 1 month after drinking,"I drank this tea 3-4 cups everyday and the next period I was pregnant after 7 years of trying. I boiled water and used 1 tea bag drank that entire pot the whole day. I didnt know it would work this well, worth every penny."
4,For Labor/Pregnancy,"I read and read about midwives etc who recommended red raspberry leaf tea for strengthening and toning the uterus in preparation for labor. I finally bought this, and worked myself up to 3 strong cups of it a day after my 36th week. I'll just tell you what I know. This was my 2nd pregnancy. With my first I went almost to 42 weeks and then induced (and subsequently c-sectioned). This time, I spontaneously went into labor at week 38 (and had a VBAC). My labor was about 2 hours long. INTENSE (and kind of terrible). I don't know if this tea really did strengthen my uterus into being more efficient, or if it brought on labor. I definitely had a very different outcome this time around. And if nothing else, how can it harm? Hey, you're not only getting hydrated, but it's good for the psyche too. You feel like you're doing something to help your little one come out to your arms, safely. I'd do it again."
2,Packaging sucked,"The tea taste good, but it took 2 weeks to arrive! Not only that but the outside box and every single box inside was dented and ripped! It was very disappointing! I will be ordering my red raspberry leaf tea from another vender next time!"
5,Great Deal,"I ordered a case of raspberry tea, got a much better deal than any other place. I just love the convenience of Amazon, and the great deals. The good thing is their ever expanding stock, and their Prime membership makes shipping so much cheaper. Oh about the tea, I use it to help ease the worries of growing older and things getting out of place, great tea, makes me feel fine."
4,"nice music, cheesy lyrics","Artension is a prog metal band with focus around the keyboardist versus a guitarist. The vocalist at times sounds a lot like Graham Bonnet (Rainbow, Impelliteri) and the songs are generally catchy. The lyric department could use a little work... ""Show me the answers to questions within my heart"" pleas the band on the first track ""Area 51.."" Since when are questions about aliens heart felt? And then there's ""Through the Gate"" with the oh so original ""Through the gate... it's too late..."" Otherwise, this group seems to have some potential, check them out if you like other progressive metal acts like Dream Theater, Stratovarius, Rhapsody, etc..."
1,Not what was advertised,"I also received non-Simmons brand changing pad covers sold by BabyAge and they were also labeled bonus and not for individual sale. They were described as being plush terry cloth, but are actually a thin knit and not very soft. I am very disappointed with this purchase.Update: I called BabyAge and they were very apologetic about sending a different product than what was advertised and gave me a full refund. When I called them, they gave me instructions to print out a pre-paid shipping label they would email me and send it back. The next day, I received an email apology saying I could keep the changing pad covers as well as the refund."
5,Alain Lefèvre transmits feelings,"I have not listened this record, but recently I watched a T. V. special about him (Channel 22 Mexico), and he is very impresive. He was playing Lizt and Wagner. I am a Wagner lover, but I have always listened Wagner in orchestra. When I listened Lefèvre playing Wagner I felt the necessity of looking for his records."
3,Helpful information,"This is a great textbook, very comprehensive information on the subject, the the writing could be clearer. It would be hard to make this subject into a page turner, but in this book it's sometimes difficult to pick up the relevant information because the writing is so dry."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book has SEVERAL errors in it. Formulas are written incorrectly - some topics are totally absent! One particular passage tells the reader to ""refer to a textbook on classical control"" to review a certain topic. I thought that was the reason for purchasing the book!?! It is faster for me to read an entire chapter in the textbook than to go through a one-page review in this book. Wading through the botched formulas and skipped topics is a waste of the reader's time."
2,Rather poor,"Missing information, poor layout of topics, difficult to read. Recommend instead the EE Review Manual, or for more detailed review use Fundamentals of EE by Bobrow, for circuit theory and electronics, and Power Systems Analysis by Grainger for the power module."
2,"disorganized, unprofessional appearance","LaHaye and Hindson have outdone themselves with this product. While the information may be useful, the presentation is utterly disorganized and poorly presented, creating the stigma of fringe religion propaganda. Overall, I found this text worthless in my class, with Google being a better method of finding the info I needed."
3,pretty informative..,"i've read 100 prophecy outlines. this one's good. it's an encyclopedic, a-z style outline. takes a while to read from beginning to end."
3,Not Eddie's Best Work,"Title says it all. Wasn't real impressed with this particular solo CD. I love his other solo work & keyboards/violin with UK. Actually got to see UK in a bar room In Baton Rouge, LA. The audience might have been 300 people max. Very intimate setting & excellent music with prodigy prog. musicians."
5,blew me away,"I happened upon this cd by accident, my brother in-law had a big stack of cd's, and most were new age and since I've been listening to Tangerine dream at the time (1985) I thought I'd give this a listen. Since then I average once a week playtime, Eddie Jobson is a combo of Tangerine Dream, Vangelis and a little bit of Patrick O'Hearn thrown in for good measure. No one comes close to playing the piano or any type thereof. If you ever come across this cd, prepare to be blown away."
5,Unlike any electronica before or since,"As an up-front disclaimer, my opinion is that virtually anything Eddie Jobson has ever recorded--with the possible exception of ""UK Live""--is pure gold.That said, ""Theme of Secrets"" is nothing like the amazing UK self-titled release or excellent ""Danger Money"" sophomore followup. Instead ""Theme of Secrets"" is an atmospheric and fairly unified suite of eight instrumentals that very effectively illicit altogether different moods and landscapes. The word that comes to mind to me is... ""otherworldly"". Jobson uses the Synclavier with amazing skill and is unafraid to blend what sometimes sound like synth sound effects into musical elements that integrate beautifully with the haunting melodies. An album far ahead of it's time; a landmark in electronic instrumental composition and utterly unique."
5,Max Collins Purgatory,This was a gift for someone who has been looking for this particular book for a long time. Was delighted in finding it for him.
1,No Show!,Item never showed up. I was told another was sent and I have not received it either. Buyer Beware!!
2,Computer couldn't be shut down with this card installed!,"I installed the latest drivers via the dlink website as of this writing. The card worked wonderfully, far more range than my g card. Signal strength was excellent. It was great until I went to shutdown my Vista HP notebook. It would restart everytime unless I physically pulled out this card before shutting down.I even went so far as a fresh install, same exact thing, restart on shut down everytime. How frustrating. I've read where another person had this exact same flaw happen with their HP notebook. It must be an incompatibility with HP notebooks and at least this expresscard. BTW, everything was updated on the notebook, ie Service Pack 1, and all the HP updates including the latest notebook bios firmware.I thought about just pulling it whenever I shut down, but ruled against that because I paid for this thing to work better than that. Give me some good luck with my next expresscard, the linksys, fingers crossed."
1,NOT READY FOR VISTA,The Xtreme N Express Card does not work with Microsoft Vista. The drivers do not work and they prevent the computer from shutting down properly. Technical Support at D-Link was not useful. Do not use this card if you have Windows Vista. I uninstalled the drivers after removing the card and the computer did shut down properly.
2,Extreme N Express Card,"Read negative reviews but tried it anyways. Card does not start up each time with Vista. Needs to be inserted multiple times and doesn't hold signal. Saw no speed improvement over standard Wirless G connection, built into Dell Laptop and not dependable. Other reviews were correct."
2,Fails To Meet Performance Claims,Installed the product in a fast Toshiba laptop running Vista. Product would only connect to my D-Link wireless-n router at 130Mbps. Calls to D-Link support have not helped. D-Link cardbus adapter in a much older/slower laptop connects at 300Mbps
2,Dissapoointed,"I upgraded my router to the N spec and eagerly looked forward to higher speeds and greater signal strength using this Express card adapter. I was able to get it setup and working only to find the signal strength worse than my built in G spec network adapter in my HP notebook. It reported faster speeds but I honestly couldn't tell the difference in actual usage.The other problem is that if anybody else logs on to the network with a G spec card (or lower) it drops the whole network down to that level. Consequently I have quit using the adapter and gone back to the built in hardware in my notebook as it gives about 30% better reception and more speed than the internet permits anyway.This is my second attempt at upgrading to N spec, maybe someday N spec will live up to the hype.I wouldn't waste your money on this unless you don't have any other options."
1,xtreme-N Express card wireless adapter,This product does not seat properly into Express card slots. As a result this adapter frequently dislodges causing network disconnects.
5,The History of Science Should be Y-Rated.,"Bauer argues that the notion of a single, logical Scientific Method is contradicted by the ongoing process of science and by its history (i.e., the history of science).The facts strongly suggest that something similar to a Douglas McGregor ""Theory Y"" mindset and the set of relationships it implies are necessary to produce useful scientific results, while ""Theory X"" minds and relationships, though possibly useful in simplifying communications or in taking credit for ""Theory Y"" activities, are not ideas that can by themselves legitimately create paradiam shifts. (Read the Human Side of Enterprise by Douglas McGregor to understand what I'm getting at.)""Theory Y"" does not deny that Love is a commodity. Nor that competitive forces are not part and partial of this entity. Love has its own market with rules, supply, and demand dictacted by the heart."
1,Anti-creationism dressed up in a mountain of fancy talk,"Anti-creationism dressed up in a mountain of fancy talk. You don't need a mountian of fancy talk to learn ""science"" isn't something to base your life on. The author seems very confused, in which he doesn't want people engaging in ""scientism"" and not to base your life on it, and that there's different types of science, and it shouldn't be closed off to new ideas, yet this guy sneaks in some asburd comments about creationism being pseudo science without ANY evidence. Yet clearly, his book is supposed to be against that type of discrimination. What a whopper of a mistake. This is just an anti-religionist trying to come across as reasonable, but fails, because he is against the very thing he's teaching: being open to what is reasonable."
4,Elaine May never did anything poorly,"Any movie that involves Elaine May in any role is worth watching. Ishtar is a movie that becomes more hilarious with successive viewings. It has been my experience that movies, and especially comedies, must be watched more than once to get an accurate feel for the artistry and talents contained in them. On the second viewing one can usually tell whether a third viewing is tolerable. Ishtar withstands the test of multiple viewings and I have watched it many times. Close seconds to Elaine May are the talents of both Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman. Two talented actors play goofy guys with big dreams similar to the ones we all have. They stumble around giving us many laughs until they succeed which is even funnier. What could be more entertaining? Considering the ongoing political situation in the Middle East this film also contains contemporary humorous issues. I own my own VHS copy and hope to add the DVD to my collection. SA Walsh"
4,"Come on, it's not THAT bad!","ISHTAR has the reputation for being one of the worst big-budget films of all time, yet it's a happy and enchanting road picture that will probably entertain and charm you. A classic example of how over-spending, big celebrity egos, Hollywood hype and bad word of mouth can destroy an otherwise pleasant film."
4,"Don't tell anyone, but I LOVE Ishtar","Ok, so MOST of my friends either refuse to watch the video with me or fall asleep ten minutes into it. A very few of my friends agree that this movie is so far beyond bad that it's terrific. I've seen Ishtar more times than I can remember, and every time I laugh. If you're a little quirky, and if you're willing to take the movie as a song and character showcase (forget the plot!), then you may have found a new favorite movie to torture your loved ones with.I'm not kidding.Imagine if you will Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty singing (badly) these super lines:""I said come look there's a wardrobe of love in my eyes/ Come on in, take a look and see if there's something your size.""""Telling the truth is a dangerous business/ Honest and popular don't go hand in hand./ If you admit that you can play the accordion/ No one will hire you in a rock-n-roll band.""You live your life and I'll live mine, and mine will always include a copy of Ishtar."
4,a funny movie,"this movie is well acted and funny. it is unusual in that it casts the excellent actors against type, and this offends many viewers. i.e. the principals do sing badly, as this is a main point of the humor, and still some reviewers say they disliked it because the actors cannot sing well (see above). hellooo.....warren beatty plays a guy who cannot get a date, and there aRE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIKE SUCH PORTRAYALS. who would have believed such a good movie could become synonymous with a bad movie?intelligent reviewers like vincent canby and eleanor ringel loved it, but movies that lampoon untalented morons do not appeal to the average viewer. i have even been dissed at blockbusters by imbecile counter help (who had not seen it) when trying to rent it.if you like hoffman, beatty and grodin, you should enjoy this movie.i logged on here to buy it, but unbelievably the movie is not even availalle in region 1 format. what a joke. somebody definitely had a grudge against this movie."
5,Our family loves this movie. It IS a COMEDY!!,This really is a funny movie. Our family watches it yearly and we laugh harder each time. This is definitely underrated. What a hoot. The reviewers take this one too seriously.
5,Classic comedy for all ages,"Ishtar is a witty tale of two feckless songwriters who discover that telling the truth can be dangerous business. Although slighted by the press, this sleeper is one of the greatest comedies since the Odd Couple. In both dialogue and lyric, Beatty and Hoffman shine like Golamine beads in the desert night. END"
5,"I love it, I Love It, I LOVE IT!!!!","If you like movies like ""Fletch"" and ""Caddy Shack,"" ""Ishtar"" is better!! I love this movie and will watch it several times a year until the day I die. An unbelieveable story, the humor in being niave, and the worst songs you've ever heard make for one of the funniest movies of all time."
2,The Stuff of Legends,"While it's no ""Road to Morocco"", this so-called bomb isn't a hall-of-fame stinker either. I'm almost embarrassed that I laughed everytime ""Rogers & Clarke"" did their act. Once they get to Morocco, though, and the idiotic ""intrigue"" begins, Ishtar is rather excruciating. A half-asser at best, though I still think ""Dangerous Business"" is a good song!"
4,It's fun!,"I know a lot of people have said this movie was stupid, and other negative things but I just loved it. It made me laugh out loud. Okay, so it wasn't the best thing either Dustin Hoffman or Warren Beatty have ever done - I don't think either of them intended it to be a serious drama! They both looked to me like they had a ball filming it and it shows in their interaction together. The fun they had comes through and makes it real. If you're a fan of Hoffman and Beatty and want to see them having fun, then this is the movie for you."
5,Watch Ishtar,"Picture a not-so-smart Warren Beatty saying, ""There's no wind in the desert."" Five minutes later he begins crying when a piece of sand blows into his eye. Until you have seen Dustin Hoffman trying to auction smuggled guns off in Arabic, you don't know what laughing is! ""Ishtar--you're more than a country, you're a state of mind!"" A blind camel with an aching tooth. Brilliant."
5,One of the funniest comedies ever,"Ishtar is a brilliant movie. The comedy is so insightful and hilarious. Every once in a while I watch it again and laugh so much I have to pause it until I am ready to continue. It is also inspiring when I feel discouraged. The fact that so many people don't like it is a sad commentary on the cattle herd mentality, peer pressure, and lack of thought that is so pervasive not just with school children, but in all age groups."
1,"Not funny, not entertaining","First, let me say that I saw this movie before seeing any of the negative reviews. I had no preconceptions - I just wanted to be entertained.The movie is neither funny nor entertaining. The plot is halfway decent, but just when it starts to get going, the movie simply ends. We have secret agents and Arabs chasing the heroes, and then.... end of movie.I think it was the Far Side's version of video rental hell: 10,000 copies of Ishtar and nothing else."
5,Underated movie; actually quite funny,"Compared to the schlock that most comedy films are, this movie, which doesn't take itself seriously, has moments of genuine side-splitting humor. Like lemmings, some who have read the reviews and, thus, know they're not supposed to like the movie, don't like the movie. The reality is,however, that Ishtar is one funny movie. Far funnier than, for example, A Fish Called Wanda."
2,Beatty and Hoffman in a totally ridiculous debacle!,"I have finally seen ISHTAR for the first time since it's theatrical release in 1987. I remember all of the hullaballo about how much it cost and how poorly it was received. So after twenty years I thought I would see for myself......UGH!.....and boy, was this one dull and not funny movie! What a waste of ability,especially Warren Beatty who truly was ridiculous in his role. Hoffman fares only slightly better. The humor falls absolutely flat and the film is consumed in it's own folly.I kept thinking if Will Ferrell could have made this any funnier. Hoffman and Beatty are two marvelous actors, but this film cannot be saved by their presence. In fact, their presence actually makes the film more impossible to sit through. The blind camel in the desert scene is painful to watch!!! Only the lounge singer episode in Morocco was even the slightest bit humorous. Now I have seen it and can decide for myself.....what a terrible film!!!"
2,"A terrible movie, no doubt.","Ishtar remains one of the worst movies in history. I am 70 years old and it is the worst movie I have ever seen. Do not waste time watching it. Director Elaine May does an excellent job of squandering the talents of two top notch actors, Hoffman and Beatty."
1,THIS FILM IS AWFUL,THIS MOVIE IS BORING AS HELL. IT'S UNFUNNY AND YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP BEFORE IT ENDS. IN OTHER WORDS:AVOID IT.
1,Ishtar in wrong format,It is the wrong format and cannot be viewed in the U.S. It is disappointing to finally find a copy of the movie and then be unable to see it.
2,Wrong format,"I didn't realize it was in Europeon format, so I can watch it. Would like to ship it back because I can't use it."
3,3 stars,"i like RBL and Black-C a lot. Taydatay is my favorite from 11/5. So this combo made me expect a lot. Production is not as great as I would have thought, but there are some cuts (at least a few from black c) that dont sound too rapmaster keyboard-drum machine style. I liked the title track w/ big mack. taydatay/big mac collabo album would be good. as i said, the lyrics overshadow the production- sean t (he did this title track), ric roc (its hard 2 b-legit) have the best in the bay right now.."
3,Do YOU know you needed a CD?,"I have to say..I just started using this series and thus far, the written portion is great! But how could I have known it required a very expensive CD? I sure wish that part had been stated before I ordered this series."
1,Putting others down to make himself feel better.,"As a student of Morehead State University and a long time resident of Appalachia, I can only hope that Mr. Offutt intended his book to be PURE FICTION. In addition, I even took the one creative writing course he offered (and at the time I was very satisfied with the class). Because of this, I can honestly and confidently say that the author made up almost all of his situations to make himself out to be a superior to Appalachian natives he claims to 'know' so well. His repeated insults and sly innuendos do nothing but make him look like a fool to those who know the truth. 'Back home,' you can bet we all know the real reason he left was not his disappointment in Appalachia, but Appalachia's disappointment in him."
1,Condescending and self-absorbed,"I'm from the county Offutt writes about coming home to, and if we were really as backward and hickish as he describes us I would be leaving too. No, there's not a lot of opportunity here for our kids (most of whom do graduate from high school, and a good many from college). And yes, it's pretty provincial. But if what he tells here is what he really saw then he sure wasn't paying much attention. And if he really came here to save us from what he imagines is our way of life, all discount shopping and video stores and driving around in rusted-out trucks, it's no surprise he came away disappointed.He treats the story of his in-laws better, but the rest of this book doesn't deserve to be called ""nonfiction."" Too bad a lot of people who don't know better will believe it."
3,Not Too Bad...Not Too Good,"Offutt's strength is his prose and characterization, but his narrative is a little off here. A shame really, because his first memoir was solid all around. He himself admits to not knowing what the Holocaust story has to do with his own return to Kentucky and, quite frankly, neither do I. It seemed thrown in as maudlin filler and was blatantly incongruous.The ending seemed rushed too. ""I am saying good-bye"" and ""I want to stay. I am ready to leave."" I know he can do better and the rest of the book proves that he can do better.Still though, there are some stylistic gems here. Offutt uses words and characters wonderfully. You'll love them and understand them. He's a very solid writer and students learning to write creatively can learn a lot from his craft--overtly and subtly.Worth a read."
1,Grossly inaccurate,"I made it through one chapter of NO HEROES which Offutt should think quite an accomplishment since I am from Eastern Kentucky and a graduate of Morehead State University. Not finishing the book has less to do with literacy or intelligence and more to do with an appreciation for accurate information (an appreciation clearly not shared by the author since he tosses around more fiction than fact). It seems quite tragic to me that someone with such a passion for ""saving the uneducated"" would now be so blatantly perpetuating the stereotypes he CLEARLY worked so diligently to overcome. I have found heroes all over Eastern Kentucky... my family, local educators, civic leaders, etc. However, I'm sure Mr. Offutt found NO HEROES here. He wasn't examining anyone but himself."
4,No Dog In This Hunt,"I'm not from Kentucky and have never visited the state, so I can't speak to any factual errors that might be in this book. I CAN say that I found it an excellent read and it brought to life scenes I can have no personal experience of, whether they transpire in the hills of KY or in the prison camps of WWII. The juxtaposition of the Holocaust tales and the homecoming to Kentucky stories is unusual, but it worked for me; I've never felt so vividly what Jews went through under the Nazis.Looking at Chris Offutt's pictures and reading his words, I don't think I'd get along with him too well. He does seem to have a chip on his shoulder and seems haunted by some ghosts that elude his attempts to put them to rest. But he uses words well and gave me a couple of interesting hours inside his head...a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't--well, you know."
4,longitude and attitude,"this memoir reads like a journal and seems to square many assumptions the writer went into a larger world to confirm. my own experience: leaving the south, making friends from other cultures, then coming back (for what?) line up almost perfectly with the trajectory of Mr. Offutts story. Progress has been made, work needs to be done.Locals who have problems with this book, I have advice: go and be.Chris is actually doing you a service..."
3,Average,"Three stars may be generous for the game. There is really only one way to consistently score: take the ball right to the hoop while using the ""juke"" moves. Short range jump shots don't work. Post-up game: forget it. Anything resembling a real basketball game: forget it. But if you do take the ball to the hoop and use the juke moves and you have one of the star players it is unstoppable. Play LeBron: he'llo score every time. If you like a pure arcade-style game then you might like this one."
1,Hindered game,The game has an update which changes the game play where now when you take a shot the player is moving towards the basket as if he is taking a running jumper. The game originally did not function in that manner.
1,The loading time is soo slow!,"The games is fun once it's loaded. Making a freethrow and alley-oop is so easy. The game is fun. However, it takes up to 2-mins to load and by the time it loads, I dont feel like playing it anymore. Having said that, I sold it just after a week. I used to play NBA 2K and I thought NBA Live was better. With the slow loading time, I'm going back to NBA 2K."
4,Neil is GOD!!!!,"Forget the book!!Sure, it's interesting. But turn your gaze toward those speakers, and lend him again your ears!!! Listen to the ingeniously, inhumanly technical drum fills in classics like Subdivisions, Hemispheres, and Xanadu! Listen to the poetry of The Trees, The Analog Kid, Limelight, and Natural Science!"
4,elegant prose written in peart's lyrical style.,"As a fan of the band mr.peart is a member of, rush, i found it difficult to separate my internal images of peart on stage, in press releases and in videos from peart the author and private citizen. however, in order to truly appreciate the book for what it is, a chronicle of an african bicycle trip and the inter-personal relationships that form along the way, i felt it imperative to do exactly that.my first question as i read the book was, ""will anyone recognize peart? would there be a fan on board to harangue him for the entire trip, ""dude- you are the greatest drummer ever!!"" but alas, he was lucky... until he gets to know elsa. (read the book to find out what i am referring to.)at certain points i found the book to be a bit pedestrian, but all in all, it was an enjoyable read. i will admit, however, that i probably enjoyed the book more because of who the author is."
4,Neil Peart cycles (bumpily) through West Africa...,"This one should be subtitled ""Roads?! We don't need no stinking ROADS!!!"" Those who only know Mr. Peart in percussive terms (i.e. the rock band Rush) will be suprised at the depth and intelligence displayed in his writing. The action centers around a cycling trip Peart and a small band of Westerners took through Cameroon in 1988. We are given all the gritty details as our heroes endure odd (yet consistent) cuisine, spartan accommodations, forgotten roads, and a new but disturbingly familliar sort of racism. Peart's observations range from the droll to the profound as he weaves his way through the heart of Africa at ""people speed."" An enlightening read, even for those who have no vested interest in cycling OR Africa."
3,a drummer and a thinker,"I heard Neil say in an interview many years ago that he was going to write a book someday, eight years later I was excited to finally find this book. If you're looking to read a book about Neil the drummer or Neil the musician, you will be sadly dissipointed. If you want to learn about his passion and desire read this book. If your not a cyclist you might not find this book is for you."
5,I'm a very big fan of Neil Peart and Rush.,"This book, masterfully written, lets you see inside Neil's mind. For me, it gave me real understanding of just how intensely he feels things and how intelligent he really is. Clearly he is well-read as well as observant and insightful. Now I see how he is able to write such brilliant song lyrics. I must admit, though, that at the point when he mentioned how he looked forward to seeing his then-ten-year-old daughter Selena, I had tears in my eyes (knowing that both she and her mother have passed away). This is a great read even if you aren't familiar with or particularly fond of Rush, but if you are, it will mean even more to you."
4,"Take it from me, I know!","I have had the distinct pleasure and pain of taking the same bicycle tour as Neil. I read his book after I completed my tour for no reason other than to observe someone else's interpretation of the events. I was amazed to find his experiences almost identical to mine in every aspect from the makeup of the group to the gut-wrenching pain of the night. I was even more amazed by Neil's ability to recall and so eloquently illustrate the details of his journey. My journals lack by comparison. While reading this book, I felt as though I were a member of his tour group. I think anyone with imagination can.....that is the mark of a brilliant author."
4,Lyrical and insightful ride,"Neil's book was a pleasurable ride through and impossible lasndscape. His narrative nature certainly comes through with great detail around every corner. His humanist views are razors that slash into the current defeatest mentality so very present and I found them inspiring and motivating. The portions along the trail tend either to be gripping and poignant or later, tired and redundant as Neil wraps up the journey in Chad. Otherwise a delightful romp that I have passed on several times already!"
5,Worth a second read,"I first read The Masked Rider on the plane that took me to South Korea, where I was going to live, working as a university professor. Neil's book warned me about Eastern-style toilets, locals staring, and children shouting -- though instead of ""white man"" it was ""American"".Now, after re-reading it 8 years later, I find that The Masked Rider is just as fun the second time around. Neil is starkly honest in his observations -- about his fellow riders, his experience with the locals (and their prejudices and politics), and himself. His descriptions wander from day-to-day grind to vivid scenic descriptions that create a picture in the mind's eye. His style is conversational, and his ""voice"" as a writer comes through loud and clear.I highly recommend this book to those who have wandered the world and enjoy getting another's take on travels, or those who are interested in taking a glimpse into West Africa... seasoned with philosophical musings of the Professor."
5,Shows us the man behind the drum set. Great detail of Africa,It gives us a personal look into the life of Neil Peart and his views. I could not put it down. It has great detail on his journey and struggles. Gives us compassion for this far away land and respect for their lifestyles. I am going to get his other books. Great reading.
4,Good Read,"I have read all the other Peart books, so decided to read his first book last. It gave it a different perspective, but I did enjoy the ride."
4,Shrek would like it,"I decided to revisit this book after reading ""Travelling Music."" Even if you are not a Rush fan this book has many layers; from the writer being one of a five person group, where the squeaky wheel is also the least competent, to the daily adventures of cycling through Africa and dealing with its inhabitants and (sometimes)hostile enviroment. Peart attempts a level of objectivity, trying to win the reader over with views he considers clear, but is he guilty of sharing the same level of nearsightedness as those he criticizes (only he's on the other end of the scale)? I really enjoyed reading this book since it covers more than, ""next stop, so-n-so, average 'rice with junk in it.'"" Peart lets you borrow his senses and mindset for a voluntary cyclist bootcamp. Is it the beat or the time between the beats that matter? You really need both for things to work."
5,An honest insight to a travellers experience in Africa.,"The Masked Rider, by Neil Peart is an honest insight to a travellers journey to Africa. Peart details a bicycle tour thru western Africa, and in the process manages a wide-ranging commentary on a variety of topics. Very expressive, and thoughtful in his approach as a writer."
4,Riding Shotgun with Neil,"If you're looking for tour notes, stories from the road, or even a chapter about his bandmates. This isn't for you.This book is about americans cycling in africa. It is very descriptive, the people, the places, sights, sounds, smells. The small taste of what Neil is thinking, and going through. You feel like you're there with them. I have read the other three Neil Peart books, and this one last. (out of order I know). Not what I expected, but pleasantly surprised. This is where the travel writer came out and honed his craft. Makes me want some rice with junk on it."
2,HORRIBLE TRANSFER,"EVEN THOUGH THE MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXCELLENT, THE TRANSFER IS HORRIBLE.SEEMS LIKE A BAD HOME VIDEO TRANSFER.NO MENU, NO CHAPTERS, NO EXTRAS, SUBTITLES ARE OBLIGATORY (NON OPTIONAL)...I WISH THIS HAD BEEN ADVERTISED SO THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT THIS DVD.IT JUST RUINS THE MOVIE EXPERIENCE."
3,Worth watching,"Barbarian was a better film, a feast for the eyes, great acting etc, but Destroyer is more humorous and is worth watching for the Princess alone! A bit corny especially in the Wizard scene but all in all a good fantasy film"
2,"Starts with a c ends with a p, 2 guesses and it isn't 'carp'","I am so sorry I wasted time watching this. Dumb characters, bad acting....and if the girl doesn't stop screaming, I am going to hurl."
3,Arnold's first experience,"Conan the Barbarian is back in CONAN THE DESTROYER, 1984 sequel. Without going into a long review, if you liked the first one, rent this one- but chances are you won't be pleased. CONAN THE DESTROYER (1984) Rated: PG (Fantasy Barbarian Violence) 2 1/2 stars out of 5."
2,"This is the ""The Quickening"" of the fantasy world!","This movie was an unfortunate mishap. Though it is still more amusing to watch than most movies you see on ""Movies for guys who like movies"" or ""Joe Bob Brigg's Drive-In Theater,"" someone definately wasn't paying attention when this movie was made. Instead, check out CONAN the Barbarian!!! Now THAT is an outstanding movie!Mitigating Factor: Arnold! Duh!"
3,A Must-have,"Among Arnold's early movies, this one stands out for the eclectic supporting cast. His early movies were remarkedly free of any acting on his part; I suspect he was still learning English then. But one way to make him look better is to hire nonactors, or miscast semiactors. Enter Wilt and Grace. (Later, Richard Dawson). This is as much a collectible as Terminator 2."
3,"Missed the mark, but still Conan","""Conan the Destroyer "", this disappointing sequel to the entertaining and well made ""Conan the Barbarian"" is an example of what happens when studios attempt to broaden the appeal of a movie for younger audiences. This movie tries to inject more slapstick humor and includes ""big name"" stars (Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain), while sacrificing much of the story line, effective characters, and raw action that made the first movie so watchable. The special effects were also weaker and often seemed out of place, making this a real step backwards.If it wasn't for ""Arni"", it wouldn't be worth the price of the DVD. Recommended only for die hard Conan and ""Arni"" fans."
1,Bubble gum for the brain ...,"I didn't believe there could possibly be a movie that could be that much of an insult to the viewer. I was wrong.Arnold was his usual stoic self. Chamberlain did his best [which wasn't much]. He looked as if he was constantly searching for a basketball. Mako was fine. The dialog was terrible and boring. It seemed all the virgin [Olivia d'Abo] could say was ""Bombaata!"" BORING! Arnold's comic sidekick was chilling in his inability to act and speak. The evil queen was wooden and her court advisors were barely two dimensional.Save your money. Leave this one on the shelves and buy ""Conan the Barbarian"". ""CtB"" was a good example of pulp fiction movies. ""CtD"" was the exact opposite. El Stinko Deluxe. The ONLY value in the whole movie was Mako. Unfortunately, he wasn't enough to raise this one to even a two star rating."
2,Don't be too anxious to buy this sequel of the original Conan the Barbarian,"I'm sure many of us truly embrace the original ""Conan the Barbarian"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger, but nothing could be more disappointing as a sequel than this release of ""Conan the Destroyer."" What a lame, campy movie this is. It's like a low budget porn film, but with no real porn, just a blonde girl with a pretty face (and a cute overbite), the masculine black girl, and alot of bad acting from everyone, including Arnold.I am so glad that they didn't release the two Conan films together in a twin-pak because I just simply do not want this movie in my collection. I'd like to forget that this movie even exists. I would think Arnold would too."
4,A fun entertaining movie,"Conan The Destroyer, toned down de violence and the sex of its predecessor, Conan the Barbarian. This sequel features more fantasy oriented action and some fun for younger audiences. Some people may think this is not right, but I think it makes the movie more enjoyable. The feeling of adventure is more fast paced and so its the action you get Arnold Schwarzenegger on the lead role trying to get away with some humor (the scene with a drunken Conan teaching the princess how to fight is hilarious) and some things that maybe purists wouldn't like but after all, Conan wasn't always that dark.Grace Jones, Wilt Chamberlain (that Will Chamberlain!!!), Olivia D'Abo and Sarah Douglas are among the cast. Somehow it lacks the feeling of the original big cinematic stance but this is more fun to watch.If you like fantasy adventure movies this one needs to be in your collection."
3,Good sequel,"After the succesful Conan The Barbarian the inevitable sequel took part 2 years after the first.This time Conan the Cimmerian(Schwarzenegger) must find with the help of a virgin princess a jewel that leads to the horn of a god Dagoth which a evil queen(Douglas) needs to give to their kingdom all the power of the world.Followed by the sorcerer of the first film(Mako) by a cure thief(Lester) and a agile warrior(Jones) they must face all the dangers of such a risky mission.With dign special and visual effects and the final monster made by the creator of ET the film has a whole dign production better than italian imitations(Ator) or cheesy and camp productions(Red Sonja,Barbarian Queen) and at least is entertaining and pleased to watch."
2,Soylent Conan,"This movie was directed by Richard Fleischer, of ""Soylent Green"" fame. And everything about this movie is just about that hilariously bad. Here's what makes it total doo doo:1) Script2) Cast selection3) Acting4) Direction & Camera Work5) Effects6) The utter and absolute betrayal and abandonment of anything resembling RE Howard's Conan of Cimmeria.I gave this movie a second star simply because there are a few funny moments that at least make this a lighhearted journey into awfulness.Let me sum it up this way:Remember in the *real* Conan movie when the black lotus seller tells Subotai and Conan: ""Black lotus, Stygian, the best,"" and Subotai says, ""This better not be hagga!"" and the seller says, ""I would not sell hagga to slayers such as yourselves.""Well, slayer, if you bought this movie you've just been sold a big fat bag of hagga....It ain't the real thing."
2,omg,"I'd give this movie lots'o stars. I like it. It's not long and boring like the first. There's some good swordfights. There's some magic. There's Arnold. BUT! There is also some major butchering of the gore scenes. I cringed when I watched my dvd, as I realised there were at least 3-4 scenes that had been cut. Because of this I'm takin' a bunch of stars back. One star for Arnold, and one for the swords/whole conan-setting.Don't buy until there's an uncut version."
5,The Governan,Arnold was born to make this movie. At that point and time who else could have played conan. In fact even at his current age I think Arnold still has one last conan left in him. They even set it up showing an old grey conan on the throne. Great for all ages.
2,Gonad the Ballbarian,"So Conan and friends - including Wilt Chamberlain as Bombaata and Grace Jones as Zula - are on a mission to protect a virgin princess who gets a powerful horn for the queen. Let me get this straight, someone thought it was a good idea to make a sequel to Conan the Barbarian, AND they thought it would be a good idea to cast Wilt Chamberlain to play a warrior who protects a maiden's virginity? Maybe the casting director's next choice can be OJ as a babysitter, or Steve Martin as funny.Look, I loved the original. It was epic. Everything from the story and action to even the score was great. But this sequel is abysmal, and it ruined what could have been (was supposed to be?) a trilogy of Conan movies. When Arnold is the guy in the film with the most polished acting chops, there is something extremely wrong.I would have walked out on this movie if I were watching it on an airplane."
4,Arny and Grace Jones were great!,"This is not carry the same amount of blood taste that the other Conan stories delivered. This one is more of an adventure. A quest that Conan takes, in the hope of getting back his love, Valeria. Grace Jones was excellent as Zula ( Xena on the dark side) Wilt Chamberlain, another good performer. And of course, we ""love"" watching Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan."
1,An ABSOLUTE EMBARRASEMENT!!!,This movie was a waste of time and money! As a huge fantasy fan I am completely embarrased. An absolute POS. Avoid purchasing this AT ALL COST!!
4,A simple but good sequal,"I think I liked this film better than the first because, even though the first one was a great film, about an hour of it was a total bore to me. This one kept me entetained the whole way through. The special effects and acting could have been a little better but other wise I loved it. This film wasen't as complex as the first one was mainly because it didn't have any nudity or sex in it. I think this film is very entertaining and action packed. It has come to be one of my favorite films."
1,laughing at previous review..,"Wilt Chamberlain isn't that good of an actor.. Grace Jones wasn't all *that* good.. And the reference to Xena? PLEASE.. you know, that's more of an insult to Grace than it is a compliment to this movie..This movie was an overall bad production. Get ""Conan the Barbarian"" and be happy, and never touch this one. I can see how this could appeal to a Xena watcher, but I really would have expected better after seeing Conan the Barbarian and reading tons of the Conan and other Robert Jordan books. To sum up, this is a PG rated movie. Conan is not a PG-man. Try taking Rambo and remaking it as a PG movie with funny characters involved.. you get the point. cheers."
2,Buy the Complete Quest instead,"Note to everyone, it is cheaper to buy the Complete Quest. You get two movies for less than the price of one."
2,Beyond embarassing sequel,"After director John Milius crafted a classic with the big screen adaptation of Conan the Barbarian, Universal pumped out this sequel two years later aimed at a younger crowd. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as Conan, and is undoubtadly the best thing about this film which almost parodies the original. Also featured is one of the campiest casts ever assembled which includes Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain. All in all, Conan the Destroyer isn't a bad film on it's own when you don't compare it to the original or take it seriously."
2,Sword and the Toad,This is an absurd and hastily made sequel to the far superior Conan the Barbarian. Swartz is back as the big hulking paleoanthropic warrior who has more muscle than brains. This time around the landscape looks like something out of a cheap fantasy movie and nothing ever clicks or feels like the original. The difference with this is that the first film had a believability to it and this one just oozes out vacuous emptiness. The plot concerns a princess who must fight an evil sorceress. . . not much there to begin with. Along the line there are more absurd characters including Grace Jones who resembles a twig and beats men 8 times her size with a stick. Chamberlain is even more lackluster as a personal guard to the spoiled princess who has special powers to defeat darkness. Look for the awful 'non-moving face' monster in the hall of mirrors that is about as scary as a dead fish. Even as a kid I hated this movie.
1,Conan The Destroyed,"With this cheap sequel, the epic grace of the original Conan itself sinks to the level of all the B movies that sought to imitate it. An utterly pathetic sequel that Schwarzenegger should have shunned.Although the plot was fine, it was the screenplay itself which ruined this film. The whole script was riddled with bad dialogue and stupid action scenes. In contrast to the original's cast of solid characters, the sequel has Conan accompanied by a pack of totally unappealing characters. The worst character is the sidekick thief, Malek, whose only purpose is to utter bad one-liners and act as the buffoon. As for Chamberlain, I'm sorry but the guy can't even act well in a low-grade 'B' film and should have stayed with basketball.Don't waste your money either buying or renting this film: it's not worth a dime. The only time I saw this film is when it was originally released on the big screen: I don't care to ever watch it again."
5,Works great....,"Just got this about 2 hours ago, plugged it into my computer sound card and now I can listen to music through my home theater system or stream netfix movies to my tv without switching wires every time."
3,really quite ordinary,"The last batman movie was great, this was plain ordinary. Overrated and far too generously reviewed."
5,GREAT,"I love this movie, I have been passing it around the family to let them watch it. I cant even explain how amazing the movie is, just watch it. It really is a must see."
5,Action packed,A great movie...Heath Ledger was amazing as The Joker. Action packed with great acting by the entire cast.
2,The most dissapopinting dvd release ever...,"One would think that after all the money this movie made at the box office, WB would give us a quality dvd release. I bought the 2 disc 'special' edition, and i'm still trying to figure out what's special about it.The 'bonus features' are a total joke... if you followed the stuff released before the movie came out on the net, well there's not much new for you in this. I recommend people get the single disc edition.The movie itself is ok... since i got the dvd i find that i'm skipping a lot of parts, because it's just too long and it drags for me in certain parts. Heath Ledger as he joker is what saves this movie for me for sure. His performance is flawless.I can safely say that for me personally, Batman Begins is a lot better than TDK."
5,Amazing,"Don't need to write a long review, but if you haven't seen this movie, see it in Blu-ray. It looks amazing, and the IMAX scenes even look good on a 42"" tv. Sound is great, movie is great. Stop reading, buy this movie!"
4,Blue Review,"I loved this movie since I saw it in the theater. Best Joker ever (apologies to Jack N, whom I also think was a fantastic joker). The blue ray transfer is especially good. Switching to between wide and full screen formats really enhances the viewing experience for certain scenes, particularly the over the city flying scenes which are heavily CG, but beautiful on this disk.I thought my Bravia would make it too dark, but it didn't."
3,batman,"this blu ray its anything you would expect i recomended and people should buy the box set too, thnkx e"
4,Good.,Excellent movie and it looks good on Blu-ray. Haven't watched the special features so I can't comment on those.
5,Best Batman movie so far,"A must have movie if you are a Batman fan. Great movie, brilliant director, awesome actors. Looking forward for the 3rd one this 2012"
5,good acting nice quality,"I love my blue ray player and watching this batman movie in blue ray was great. the colors, the sound are great. the story was really interesting and the acting couldn;t be beat"
2,Dark Knight Digital Copy,"I downloaded this movie and Ironman, and both of the downloads have terrible lighting contrast ratios. Maybe it's Amazon's media player that is faulty, but it doesn't adjust well."
5,Amazing,What a great movie. Probably oone of the most entertaining movies of '08. This DVD is a must have for any movie fan
4,It's a best buy,"The Blu-ray ""The Dark Knight"" has a perfect audio and video. It's a great experience!"
5,The Theory of Chaos on Full HD,The Theory of Chaos represented by The Joker made this movie a perfect movie.You must have it even if you don't like comics.
4,Long.,"Great value on Amazon. The movie was very long, I ended up helping my daughter with her homework and studying just to find the movie was still less than half over."
3,"Good movie, lousy quality pressing","Had eagerly awaited this one. Great movie, but the image quality was in no way up to BluRay standards. Not having seen it in the theater, I don't know whether this was by design.That said... Oscar-worthy."
3,"Great product, lousy treatment at the warehouse","Everybody knows the movie is fantastic, and I'm sure the transfer to blu-ray is equally as impressive, but I received this product with a giant puncture mark through the case. There was no damage to the box, so I assume it had to be due to how the movie was handled in the warehouse. It literally looks like somebody attacked it with a screwdriver. Luckily it didn't damage the disks, but regardless it's still annoying."
3,Love Dark Knight,I absolutely love this movie. I hate paying $25 for blu ray discs though as even with my top notch equipment it's just not that much better. I already have two versions of the dvd.. yeah i like it that much and wanted the blu ray basically cause the price was right. However i was disappointed as when i got it there was a golf ball type divet in the blu ray which wouldn't allow it to play. I unfortunately had to return it. I am giving this item a 3 star for midway though because i received fast service and it was extremely easy to return at no cost to me.So yes quality control sucked that this got out as it clearly couldn't play for anyone but Amazon customer service support was top notch for returns.
4,"Great product, wonderful movie","The movie is fantastic, the sound and visual quality is also excellent. This was a Christmas present for my father and he was very satisfied with it. The movie arrived in only 4 days!"
3,Watch it for Heath Ledger,"I wasnt planning on watching this movie but decided to last minute. I saw it on the huge screen at IMAX.. special effects and action was great.. heath ledger was fantastic in the role as the Joker.. i had only seen him in romance and drama roles before this, but he really suprised me with this one. He really went out leaving his mark.If you're not a fan of his, or of the Batman series, you might not become a fan from watching this movie, but i do recommend giving it a chance at least. Its a pretty good storyline and even a bit scary towards the end.. i only bought the dvd for a friend, but i wouldnt mind watching it again.Definately watch it if you're a Heath Ledger fan though.. he was awesome in his role and you will love him in this one."
5,Keith Ledger was great,This was the best role Keith Ledger played. Too bad we lost him too young. He didn't have a chance to see how great he was.
2,"Great movie, horrible, HORRIBLE rip off double disc set!!","Incredible movie! Cant say more! But I can say that everyone should save their money and buy the single disc version because the extras are so few and far between that it is simply not worth it. No deleted scenes, 2 rediculously short featurettes, some still galleries, and some imax scenes that r not worth the extra money.No interviews with any of the stars of the movie, no nothing!LOLThey will probably do another release with more extras in the future, hold off until then.And I am particularly irritated with the movie companies pushing blu ray through our throats as the new format to go to. I'm good with dvd, so give us the same extras that blu ray recieves!!!"
4,Joker is excellent,"A very good movie if you like this kind of unbelievable action. At times the ""unbelievable"" was a little over the top. The joker did a fantastic job in his role."
5,The Dark Knight,This movie was nothing short of SPECTACULAR~ I hope everyone gets a chance to see Batman Begins first so that the movie is even more understandable. I Loved each and every character in this movie! It's for sure in my top 10!
1,False ad,"The picture is of a blu ray package and that was what i wanted. When i received it i opened the bubble mailer envelope to find a mangled up Box containing the DVD set. It was so beat up and torn there was no way i could hope to return it. Now i have two copies of the DVD in my library and no Blu-ray. Needless to say, i'm very disappointed."
3,"Good, but not great","This was a solid movie, but way too long. It was as if they kept putting in another scheme for the Joker to pull off...then another...then another. Why? They could have cut 30 minutes from the movie easily.I have to say that I was expecting much more from Heath. While his performance was certainly solid, it was by no means the oscar winning portrayal I was hoping to see. And for him to have said that the role was so disturbing that it was causing insomnia and a lot of his problems--he clearly had some emotional issues then, because the Joker was actually a lot more tame that I thought he was going to be. All in all a solid movie, but it was too long and over-hyped."
3,"Awesome movie, bad video quality",When i hit the play button i watched so horrible video quality for a release that this one..i felt ripped off.The Sound- The sound is very clear and crispy. No hiss sound or cracking sound.Extras- well another let down here.
1,No Freakin' WAY Chris Nolan,"This was the longest movie ever made, clocking in at over 7 hours. Maggie Gyllenhal, a woman who has been able to construct a career despite being half Pekingese was killed off half way though but still, a very long movie. I'm sorry but Heath Ledger, a very hot man, should not have been subjected to all that face makeup. He could have and would have played the Joker much better with just his normal gorgeous face.Because of the movie, I have cut off ties with Chris Nolan and we are no longer friends. I have deleted his name from my phone book and have ignored all his texts, even when he wanted to go to the Sanrio store in Tokyo and said I could have whatever I wanted. In my opinion, this movie is way too long and he did it on purpose. Jerk."
1,Product not released but has 75+ reviews already?,"How can this product have over 75 reviews and it has not even been released yet? This is not a movie review forum, this review forum is meant for the PRODUCT (blu-ray vs other version).Amazon, please assist in filtering this, such that when I look for reviews of a PRODUCT in future, I might actually be able to find the ones which actually do, rather than have to sift through hundreds of over-zealous fans' personal step by step synopsis of the storyline."
1,.......boring boring boring......and a waste of money!,"The Dark Knight was little too depressing, that's a one time see Movie, I wasn't too impressed, but it was way better the ""Batman Begins"" that was horrible! I did love the first 3 batman movies. I just wish they would constantly change the BATMAN ACTOR! Anyway there is not much too say about this movie really ....it was a waste of my money!"
2,The Ruination Continues,"The ruination of the Batman mythos continues. Some examples:1. The heroine never dies even though she didn't belong in the first place.2. Batman doesn't endanger innocent bystanders as in the high speed chase with so much destruction.3. The Joker never ever fooled Batman pyschologically.Batman is now just another vigilante. The movie is far too long, with too much violence. Cell phone networks are incapable of doing what Batman had it do. Whatever happened to his detective skills to figure things out or weren't writers smart enough to figure something out?There probably isn't enough of the mythos left to sustain the franchise without looking like an empty shell. And there were so many good Batman stories left to tell."
2,se non ci fosse Ledger....,"posso dire la mia senza rischiare di essere fucilata? premetto, io non ho amato Ledger (come attore) ma qui devo ammetterlo: è il suo film! senza la sua interpretazione non avrebbe avuto tutto il successo avuto. parlando di Bale, dai ragazzi ok è un bel ragazzo ma il suo repertorio si ferma a due massimo tre espressioni che sfodere in tutti i suoi film..........per il resto è un comic movie niente più!"
2,Blue ray disc damaged,I bought this blue ray disc and te movie disc doesnt play. Te special features plays perfectly but I am not able to play te movie!
5,Knew what I wanted,"I've seen the movie... love the movie... bought the movie. Can't say much more than that, other than I'm pleased with it. I have a BluRay player, but I opted for the regular DVD version of this rather than pay the extra cost. The up-res picture is great, sound is good, lots of special features I haven't watched yet, etc. I'm watching it on a mid-sized HDTV. Comes with digital copy, so that's a plus (I don't use that either, but might if I had a smart phone or tablet computer). I bought this as a present for myself to quality for Super Saver shipping on some other purchases I wanted."
3,Fantastic movie marred by the shifting aspect ratio on the BD,"My star rating is for the BluRay, not the film itself.As much as I love this movie (and I do love this movie), I had to settle for the standard DVD version because of the sudden aspect ratio changes for the IMAX footage. I found this amazingly distracting and it constantly kept throwing me out of the movie. Hopefully someday they'll release another BluRay version that has the option to disable the IMAX ratio switch and I'll be able to upgrade, but until then I must make do with 480p when I watch this wonderful film. It's a shame, too, because other than the annoying ratio swapping the film looks amazing on BD."
1,Ledger wins the Oscar for this?,"Just another forgetable comic book movie. The build up and hype surrounding Ledger's performance is way overblown. He licks his lips a lot, acts crazy, has greasy hair, and you can't tell he has an Austrailian accent; that's about all I can say. There is nothing moving nor substantial in his performance. I'm sorry the guy died, but that wasn't an Academy Award winning performance. Bale and the rest of the cast go through the motions and it's all very bland. The Maggie Gyllenhall selection is puzzling; she's unattractive."
1,It sucks,It didnt come how It was described. The description showed that it had to come with an original cage but it just didn't.
1,The Dark Knight,"Maybe it is just my copy, but this product seems to be a poorly copied version. It doesn't run without very pregnant pauses between chapters. I realize it was a ""used copy"" and this one is either really used or just poorly copied. Should have paid full price for an original ""new"" copy. Sorry."
3,Why so serious....,that must have been the studios motto when they made the standard dvd. This has to be the worst transfer I have seen in modern film making. I am absolutely perplexed why this film was not made in DTS except as others have pointed out that perhaps they are trying to push Blu Ray.Its a great film ( I saw it three times in IMAX) but this dvd is a disappointment. We deserved better.
2,Sound and Audio Mixing Engineer Should Be Shot,"I will keep this short...My wife and I gave up on the movie after 40 minutes and hit EJECT. We simply could not get into the story or stop laughing anytime BATMAN would talk in that strange digitally altered voice they tried to use.I am an old comics collector and love the whole Superhero universe but I don't see the cause for excitement over this movie. Pretty flat.BUT THE BIGGEST IRRITATION that most likely contributed to us not finishing the movie was the annoying sound and audio levels.We had to watch the movie with the REMOTE in hand because dialoque was almost impossible to hear yet sound effects, music and other audio effects were vibrating and overloading our speakers.The entire time watching the film was like a video game with the thumb RIDING THE VOLUME KNOB up and down and up and down, etc..Horrible.... sound and audio mixing that ruined the potential enjoyment of the film. (referring to DVD version here)."
2,CLICHE AND WAY TOO MUCH MAKEUP!,"This is one of the most over-hyped movies I have seen in a long time! Ledger was good, really good. I think the most impressive thing he did was come up with a fresh take on the Joker after several famous portrayals. But ""Best Actor""???? The movie was cliche cliche cliche! NOTHING new or inventive. At all! Ohhhh... sometimes good people go bad. Really??? That is the best they could do? WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS FILM????? NOTHING! It had a lot of action, but was SO OBVIOUS what was going to happen, there was no suspense. And the ""Raspy Batman voice"" was REALLY IRRITATING! And what was up with the excessive makeup on some people? Was this movie sponsored by MAC Cosmetics?WAY OVERRATED!"
2,"Incredible movie, disappointing DVD.","This was the best movie I saw this year. In fact, I saw it seven times in the theater. As a result of its great success and the huge buzz over Heath Ledger's legendary performance and tragic demise, I figured The special edition DVD would blow my mind-hole. This certainly was not the case. The only decent special features are an interview with Hans Zimmer and others from the production crew about casting the score, and a featurette on the technology Batman utilizes. The other features (the full-framed IMAX scenes, a few mocked-up episodes of ""Gotham Tonight"", and a picture gallery) could have been left off as far as I'm concerned. No commentaries, no gag reels, no deleted or extended scenes, and not even a word about Ledger. Those are the things that make a SE DVD worth shelling out extra money for.If I had looked up the DVD to check out the special features before pre-ordering it, I'd have gotten the single disc edition. I suggest you do the same."
1,Despicable,"I would give this movie negative stars if I could. Wheezes and puffs to be taken seriously, but what's the point? Sadism and terrorism as ""entertainment""? When people are crouching in terror in hotels in Mumbai, do we really need to see children threatened with guns and masked hostages with fake guns taped to their hands?Boring, long-winded, wretchedly acted -- esp. Christian Bale. He may be one of the worst actors ever. And will Morgan Freeman stop taking roles in which he's the ultimate paragon of honesty?"
5,AUCKING FMAZING,"THIS WAS HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER! OYA! AND THE WAY I READ IT ONLINE WITH PEOPLE RATING IT BAD *cough*(robert downy jr), THEY CAN GO SCREW OFF AND LIKE DAT! HEATH DEFINETLEY DESERVES 2 OR MORE OSCARS IN THIS LIKE ONE OF MY COUSIN WHO ALSO HAS WON A NOBBLE PEACE PRIZE IN A PUMPIN EATING CONTEST OYA!!! OYA.....!!! AND LIKE DAT..... BUT IT'S SAD THAT HE DIED I THINK PRINCE MADE A SONG OUT OF IT THAT I KNEW SOMEONE WHO WROTE FOR HIM BUT THEY CHANGED THE LYRICS FROM, ""THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN MICE FARTS"" TO WHAT YOU HEAR NOW A DAYS. OYA OYA OYA! AND LIKE DAT LIKE DAT LIKE DAT."
3,great but not entertaining!,"Everyone knows about the movies that are very well written, casted, and directed. They are awarded and phrased films we've placed on our movie shelves for good looks and not show (There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men, Atonement, Titanic, Broke back Mountain, Batman Returns, may i continue...) . I have added The Dark Knight to the movie I must own, because it was great (and Heath Ledger died before it's release and has made it history), but i will never suffer through the three hours of talk talk talk and batman's boring humiliation AGAIN!!! EVER!"
3,Batman,"Batman tries to destroy organized crime in Gotham. The Joker is the adversary here in this sequel to Batman Begins. It was one of the top two highest grossing films ever along with Spider Man 3. Comic fan or not, Batman has his origins in the 1930s with Detective Comics, hence the DC company. Nightwing was the original Robin. The secind Robin was killed by The Joker in A Death in the Family. In the Knightfall, Knightquest and Knightsend series in the 90s, Batman is crippled by a new villain named Bane. His latest protege Azrael dones an upgraded costume in his sit in as Batman. In Zero Hour Nightwing regrets Batman didn't take him as the fill in. They brought in Batgirl in like 1989."
3,Dark and intense,"I really enjoyed Batman Begins and looked forward to this movie, but I was disappointed. The story line is great, the acting superb, but it is extremely dark and violent. I think it could all have been done as effectively without all the gratuitous ugliness. The depiction of the prosecutor after his burns was not believable and better suited to a horror movie. A very good concept taken too far."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first","If you loved the first movie, you might be let down by this one. Although it's worth seeing. It's certainly worth the $1.96 I paid on black friday. I wouldnt pay more than $4 for it though."
1,Nothing compared to itunes,"I wanted to watch this movie again, before going to the cinema to watch the new batman movie. I usually rent through itunes, but i saw that amazon is providing the same service. I have bought through amazon in the past and I haven't had a negative experience that's why i decided to give it a try (the price was also cheaper than itunes). I tried watching the movie but I wasn't successful, the audio would go faster than the video.I couldn't finish the movie. I tried downloading the movie to my computer but i wasn't able to....I have an excellent internet connection, i have no problem downloading video or watching TV or movies online (through other companies) so I was very dissatisfied with the quality of this service provided by amazon.I will stick to my regular use of the amazon website."
3,dark,"The acting was great!!! The movie, though, was very dark. I like a little more light!! Heath Ledger will be missed!!!!!!"
4,The Dark Knight,I bought the movie for my son who is 17. He loves this movie. I watched it Christmas night with him and I felt the City of Gotham rather depressing but the acting and the movie was well made.
5,Oscar Worthy? Yes!,I thought that the buzz about an Oscar for Heath Ledger as the Joker was over-hype. No! It's well deserved. An excellent follow-up to Batman Begins. A great comic book movie! No sleeping through this movie. I thought that it almost crossed the PG-13 line into R territory.
3,"Needs more bonus features, real ones","Apart from the mask, there isn't that much special about this limited edition. No audio commentary is my big complaint. However, the Batman Unmasked featurette is an unexpected pleasure, as it psychoanalyzes Batman in all his incarnations. I suspect there's another limited edition coming with more bells and whistles. Me, I bought this because I loved the movie and this set cost as much as the regular two-DVD edition."
5,Excellent quality for a low price,"I can't believe I got such a great deal here. Including the shipping I spent about $11 for the movie. The Blu Ray includes the movie, with a digital copy on DVD and a disk with special features. It has language options which is always good. I'm very satisfied."
3,Great movie...very poor DVD transfer,"I wil not get into a review of the film itself, other than to say its an outstanding movie...far transending the genre into a truly imaginative frightening film. The DVD on the other hand is insultingly bad. Poor resolution...artifacts...edge enhancement....lots of compression...poor black levels...etc. Its dvds like this that make some believe that studios, especially Warrner Brothers are intentionaly degrading the potental quality on standard DVD to help push Blu Ray. Until this dvd I thought that was some paranoid delusion on the part of some film fans, but this DVD is so shoddy ...especially for such a film, that I can almost believe that they may be on to something. Shame on Warner Brothers for this truly sub standard DVD. I am a television producer, so I know what a DVD can and should look like...and this is NOT it!!!"
3,Shame on Warner Brothers,"Yes, Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is an excellent film without question. BUT, shame on Warner Bros. for releasing such a not-so-special 2disk special edition for it's initial release onto DVD. NO INTERVIEWS WITH HEATH LEDGER? Or most of the cast and crew for that matter. Instead you get a scant pathetic 2 ""making off"" tiny featurettes, 6 lame episodes of ""Gotham Tonight"" the seperated IMAX scenes, and some yawn trailers and photo galleries. They're obviously saving the real good stuff for next year's release after Ledger's won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his amazing portrayal of the Joker.So yes, the film rocks, this release sucks though, so Please...be Patient."
2,Long and uninteresting...,"Lots of action that isn't motivated. Lots of scenes that aren't plotted. Granted, The Joker is the best part of the movie. Batman, eh, becomes quite uninteresting after 80 minutes of action scene after action scene - salt and peppered with character building actor scenes - that seemingly have nothing to do with plot. This is a great example of a movie people like because mass media told them to like it. The first Batman is far superior."
2,A dissenting opinion,"It seems like everyone liked the movie, but I found it very long, slow and full of sloppy sentimentalism. The good vs evil angle that the movie tries to take gets very tiresome - it gets preachy without being profound, with cheesy lines. The plot makes no sense. ""Moneyball"" was way more engaging, thoughtful and entertaining than this one."
3,Overrated,"This movie simply had too many holes in the plot and was far too drawn out to earn the title of best movie in the current Batman series. Batman Begins was a much more compelling, well written, and far better film in my opinion."
2,The Dark Knight 2 Disk +Digital Copy,"Movie is fine, but digital copy product key had ""expired"". I just got this movie. That is false advertising on the part of Warner Bros. (and actually amazon) I would have purchased a different version, probably cheaper, if i knew the digital copy would not work. typical."
5,Great.,"my favorite movie of all time, but the set itself is great too. Especially at such a low price, if you have a blu ray player or ps3, just have this on hand. It'll be the best $7.49 you ever spend. The movie looks fantastic and there are really a lot of special features. Just get it."
4,aspect ratio,"Just a heads up, this version has IMAX sequences that are filmed (or edited) at a different aspect ratio. So watching on a 16:9 (widescreen) TV, sometimes there's bars on the top and bottom of the movie, and sometimes the movie fills the whole screen. It's definitely a little weird. And it switches back and forth during a scene change. Some may not notice it, and I didn't get too distracted, but it was a little odd and I could see some people getting annoyed with it. I'm not sure if the one you'd buy at the store would be the same or not."
3,"Overlong, with a weak third act","The Bottom Line:The Dark Knight, despite being one of the best reviewed films of 2009, does not measure up to the accolades bestowed upon it or to its prequel Batman Begins; it's poorly-plotted (the ending *actually* hinges on a magical technology that allows Batman to see what everyone in the city is doing), severely overlong at 150 minutes, inconsistent with its characters (Harvey Dent is supposed to be enraged at the death of his fiancée, yet he teams up with her murderer) and just not the gem that it is made out to be.2.5/4"
2,Worth Much More,"To begin with, I loved the Dark Knight. I think it was one of the best movies to come out in 2008. But I'm reviewing the product here, not the movie.I got the single disc full-screen DVD for Christmas, and was initially excited. But when I popped it in, I realized that it had NO extra features except subtitles. I mean none. This product is just the movie, so if that's all you want, go for it. But personally, I feel like the Dark Knight is well worth springing a little extra cash on to get some extras."
2,Over-rated in nearly every way,"Don't get me wrong, it's not a totally terrible movie, but this movie is pretty incoherent. Christian Bale is believable as batman, which is no small accomplishment. The highlight performance of the joker is okay, better than others, it is creepy in a clown sort of way, but slightly overrated."
2,Good Movie - Bad DVD,"The DVD was defective about 5 mins into the move. It was, from that point, totally unwatchable. Borrowed another from a neighbor to be able to finish watching it.Although annoying, AMAZON made good and shipped me a new one right away."
5,A Masterpiece!,Heath ledger is phenomenal in his performance as the joker! Christopher Nolan has re created the Batman franchise into something batman fans can be proud of. I was thrilled with the first movie and this one was even better. christopher Nolan and his crew have really outdone themselves this time.
2,Music overpowered Dialogue at the ending.,"It was a fantastic movie for Batman, the Joker and the D.A., and Batman's ill-fated fan-girlfriend. However, either the theater employees turned up the volume on the music, or the music track played way too loud so that the dialogue could not be heard. What was said at the end of the movie was lost in the loud music. The loud music ruined hearing the last words. I hope that the last dialogue of the DVD is not spoiled like it was in the theater. (Repetition for emphasis) I may rent The Dark Knight first, before I buy it, to make sure that the dialogue is not overpowered by the music score."
1,Batman or Freud?,"This is similar to doing a remake of Sleeping Beauty and having the plot revolve around the challenges of narcolepsy! Come on - it's supposed to be a COMIC BOOK. Escapsim! I turned the movie off half-way through, 'cause it was so lame. The Joker's profound and disturbing schizophrenia, the struggle between Batman as hero or vigilante - it might be a wonderful movie, but it's not ""Batman"" I may be dating myself, but I'll stick with Jack Nicholson's ""Joker"" portrayal - over the top, comic book villain. I've got nothing against a serious portrayal of the emotional issues discussed in this movie, but it struck me as false advertising to suck me into a BATMAN movie and then pass this thing off on me. I think the legacy of this movie is that it will be a classroom presentation for abnormal psych classes in colleges. Possibly valuable, but certainly not the reason I wanted to see it."
1,Great Junior High School Production!!,"I was given this movie as a gift. I didn't get all the through it before destroying it and throwing it away (I wouldn't want anyone else having to suffer through it on my account)! This is an all-to-typical example of Hollywood trash advertised as ""something big."" The plot line was flat and disjointed (or totally incoherent in some spots), the acting just ok, and the character development - well, there was none. The writers, if I can call them that, had the police doing things that no normal police agency would dream of doing!All in all this is a pathetic movie for adults to have made and I would hope that all involved in its production are sufficiently embarassed. However, if it were a junior high movie project I probably would have given it a higher score. In short, don't waste your time let alone money in viewing this garbage!"
1,IMAX and Widescreen together is a joke!,"With all the hype around this movie, someone needs to point out the crime of mixing 2.4:1 and 1.78:1 as the movie transitions from scene to scene. I spent a lot of time and effort putting together a theater at home that can handle 2.4:1 (Widescreen) movies. With the ""IMAX"" scenes what you get is good old 16x9 HDTV. I can't set the lens to widescreen mode on this movie or I'll crop the top and bottom off all the 1.78:1 scenes. I have the wonderfull experience of having bars on the sides for 1/2 the movie and bars on the top and bottom for the other half. I will try to return the movie."
1,Don't get fooled into buying the Full Screen edition,What a bunch of BS!!! You order Batman Begins widescreen and do not look and then you have this piece of crap full screen.
3,I was expecting a better film than this,"I'm so disapointed in this movie.I'm glad I waited for ""The Dark Knight""to come on HBO instead of paying for the DVD.Heath Ledger is great,He really is the Joker,but TOO much Tongue.A couple of times is alright,but every scene !Christian Bale is horrible.He sounds like Puddy on Seinfield.I can't believe he was cast to play Batman.""The Dark Knight""is not a film I want to watch again."
2,Dark and Sadistic Film,"There is no sun in Gothum City. This visually and conceptually dark film tortures the viewer with eye-strain for hours on end, until at long last, you turn it off, because by now, you don't care what happens to any of these characters."
1,$24.00 Piece of Plastic,"Just like the title says, $24.00 for a piece of plastic. Save your money and maybe you'll get a booklet with the regular case."
3,Heath Ledger - star of the show! Excellent blu-ray quality.,"There's lots of action in ""The Dark Knight"". The Joker (Heath Ledger) stole the show. He played the character perfectly! Blu-ray quality is outstanding, and the audio is awesome. I didn't like the fact that the scenes switched from the Imax view to the widescreen with black bars. This took away from the movie in my opinion. Good special features. Buy the DVD for Heath Ledger's acting and the good blu-ray video and audio. The movie is over-rated."
3,"""Why so serious?""","The Dark Knight starring Christian Bale is pretty exciting but the hype doesn't live up to my chargin. Heath Ledger is absolutely brilliant as The Joker, he is muchly missed but he's not the one who steals this movie, Aaron Eckhart is a pleasant surprise! I'm glad Katie Holmes didn't reprise her role as Rachel, Maggie Gyllenhaal is such a better actress by far. The opening scene is probably the best sequence, the ending is a bit of a letdown. Entertaining action flick but has its flaws."
2,Didn't care for it. Does not live up to the hype.,"I found Heath Ledger's performance to be very tedious and obnoxious, and the storyline took a sudden and inexplicable downward plunge in the last quarter of the movie. I turned it off and have no further interest in it. Very, very disappointing considering all the hype. I would have given it only one star if Christian Bale's performance hadn't been so good."
5,THE BAT IS BACK,"I have seen this movie five times, its just that good. This was Heath movie,and I must admit, When I first heard that he was playing the joker I was a lil skeptical,but man did he made this movie. Even though Heath is gone, I still think that he should get an award for his performance. Rest in peace my friend."
3,"The movie is great, but don't buy the special edition","Don't get me wrong on the 3 star rating, I love this movie. The reason I knocked it down is because the special edition version is a total waste of money. I could never have imagined such a total lack of effort for such a major movie as this when it comes to special features. Hell, there isn't even a director's commentary on the single disk version, so what do you think you're getting on the second disk. Yes, the two little documentaries are interesting, but are not worth the extra money. I am extremely disappointed in whoever put this thing together, my copy of Dr. Strangelove from the 1960s has more special features than this, what were they thinking."
2,The Dark Knight,"I think the movie was boring, too long, and completely not interesting. Didn't like it at all."
1,"Dark, indeed!","Buyer beware, this film is indeed Dark. Unless your idea of being entertained is being mugged by almost nonstop gratuitous violence, you will not enjoy this film. The graphic violence that is Hollywood's bread-and-butter is in full view here. It is not healthy for us, and it is not healthy for our children. Again, buyer beware!"
2,Worst of the Batman movies,"A terrible Batman movie. Too long, too complicated and the sound is awful. A dud! I kept wishing it would just end, yet it dragged on and on. Heath Ledgers' performance was the reason to watch the whole movie. I'm glad I only spent $2.99, still that was $2.98 too much."
3,The violence and destruction are unrelenting,"At one point in the movie, nearing the end, I was saying to myself, ""My God! How much longer can this go on! What more can they do!""As a showcase for special effects and especially Heath Ledger's amazing performance, this movie is a success.More from Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman would have been nice, as would more of a story.It's almost like they took an hour of the Joker's life and bisected it into seconds. Senseless violence, on and on..."
3,"OK. Not as good as ""Dark Knight""","I saw the Dark Knight without seeing Batman Begins simply because I was curious and I needed something. I was blown out of my movie-seeing brain! At the urge of the man (who wasn't present when Dark Knight came out) we saw Dark Knight Rises. It was NOT THAT GREAT. If I had to tell someone to only see one, I'd say see Dark Knight because it is non-stop suspense and intensity with so many twists and unpredictable spins you're still thinking about it. The Dark Knight Rises is predictable, looooooooong, and leaves so many open ends Christopher Nolan is lying through his 5 layers of fat that this ""trilogy"" is over. You cannot end this on a weak note. See Dark Knight. If you choose to be fulfilled, see Batman Begins, Dark Knight Rises (not cuz it's better, cuz you need the history), then Dark Knight. Don't save this til last, but save the 3 hrs if you plan on it. It's really not the best"
1,Disgusting,"Violence, violence and more violence. What happened to mystery and suspense in movies? Give me a Hitchcock movie any day."
5,"Best movie of the series, and best blu-ray experience","With regards the movie itself, it is undeniable the best in the trilogy. Period. Also, the blu-ray experience of The Dark Knight will blow your mind! Make sure you buy the single-disc blu-ray version (with the Joker on the cover)!!!Excellent purchase!"
5,Great Movie!!!,"I love Christian Bale as an actor, he is a wonderful Batman, and I just loved the whole movie. I am looking forward to watching the The Dark Knight Rises!!"
3,"Dark who, what?",I barely remember watching this. Weak story and weak performances. In the comics Batman and Bruce Wayne were big hulking guys. That helped with my suspension of disbelief. Making these guys heart throbby is obviously the idea of Hollywood suits. It sometimes works in favor of their bottom line but not this time.
5,Great,"I got this wrapped up nothing wrong with it, great movie cant wait to watch it on my new tv i for from amazon, very excited."
4,"great movie, great price, sound ok..","great movie, great price, sound ok.. aa a a a a a a a a let me submit omg lol"
5,SUPER DUPER LOVE IT,I LOVE THIS MOVIE TO ME IS ONE OF THE BEST OUT OF ALL BATMAN MOVIES THE JOKER MAKES THIS MOVIE AND THATS WHY I LV THE COVER WITH HIM ON IT
2,The Dark Knight Amazon Instant Video,I rented The Dark Knight on Amazon Instant Video and watched it with my projector. It loaded and ran fine but was definately not a quality recording. Reminded me of a Youtube video. I guess for only $1.99 I can't complain and if watching from a laptop or phone it would be OK.
4,The true spirit of An anti-hero,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but a double whammy of recent outspoken independence regarding the film really clinched it for me. First of all, I love that the DVD isn't the special features-laden 5 disc set everyone obviously hoped it would be. Buy a DVD for the movie. How many making-of featurettes could you possibly need, anyway?! Secondly, the recent snub with the Oscars has just gone to show me that a movie like this doesn't need approval from anyone to still be amazing."
5,good buy,This is an excellent movie to watch. It is family oriented but not for the small ones who gets scared easily. My teenager watches it almost every movie night.
5,Big Hit,The Dark Knight will be talked about for years to come. This Batman movie was a hit. Heath Ledger was absolutely amazing. Loved this movie.
5,Great Movie!!!!!!!!!,I had to pre-order this movie plus it was a good price for blu-ray price.It has so many features and a digital copy which is awesome too.
3,disappointing,Made poorly out of flexible plastic. overpriced. Wish it was of better quality.Movie rocks though!
4,"Great Movie and collectable, but...","This was a very good buy. I got the blue ray version that came with the joker mask. I absolutely love it. I did not know about the batman mask version at the time, but it wouldn't have mattered anyway cause I love the joker one better. My only complaint is that the hinge disk holder stays in was broken when I received it. That is why I gave it a four star rating. The disk was still in the holder so no fowl. Overall it was a great buy."
3,Good Film.,"I saw this film on an airplane on my laptop because it had been sitting on the hard drive. The graphics were very good, the acting was decent, the action was unbelievable and the rubble used was of both high in quality and quantity. This is the ideal films for people who love blockbusters, super hero films and strong villains. I don't think there is anything different here in terms of the story line.Christian Bale acted well, the late Heath Ledger was good too but overall the film doesn't have enough grey to intrigue one beyond the 153 minutes it runs for. I'm not into superhero films and think this is about as good as they get. To me, Nolan's masterpiece was The Prestige."
3,Ok movie but...,I liked Batman begins much better then this movie. I thought Dark Night was way too dark of a movie. I wasn't expecting that from what we have seen with the past Batman movie and comic books. Also all the hype on this movie was way over done. I think Heath Ledger was a great actor but this wasn't his best by far.
5,Awesome movie,"This was a great movie that I enjoyed a lot. It is a little dark so if you get disturbed easily, then I would stay away. I usually don't enjoy dark movies, but I really enjoyed this movie. The action and character development in this movie is touch notch and one that shouldn't be missed. If you saw Batman Begins, then you have to see this."
5,Not that Limited - but a nice Batpod in addition to a great movie!,"I love the Batpod and this is nice, simple model of it. The movie is excellent - we all know that - so I won't comment further. The model is nice - not too big and not too small and this item is still available even in late 2012 - if you are a Batman fan - pick one up - you won't regret it."
4,"Bass, bass, bass!!",I thought the movie was a 6 out of 10 for two reasons: A little too lengthy with some lulls and the Joker was not as he was in the comic. White makeup in this one instead of his face being bleached by acid? The interpretations by Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson were far better than Ledger's.Good cinematography and an excellent soundtrack with some serious emphasis on LFE made this an easy add for the home theater.
3,Not my kind of movie,"Well, as I turned it off after about 20 minutes or so, it would appear, definitely, that it was just not my kind of movie. A movie, must really grab me in the beginning or off it goes. This one did not."
4,great movie!,I purchased this dvd for my 17yr. old son for Christmas. He loves the movie and so does everyone else in the family. It arrived in plenty of time and in perfect condition. It included the bonus disk also. Very happy with this purchase!
5,The Dark Knight,I saw this movie at the theater and knew that when it came out on DVD that I was going to buy it. This movie tops all the Batman movies that I ever saw. You will sit on the edge of your seat and won't even want to blink your eyes while watching it. It's excellent to the very end and I was sad to see it end.
2,Crap extras,"WHile everyone goes on and on about this film, I think we should also inspect the DVD: it is crap. No commentary, no behind the scenes (unless you want to know about the bat suit or the batpod or the IMAX feature). I think IMAX must have co produced the DVD because most of the extras are all about the IMAX... big whoop.Save your money, but the single disc version: you really aren't getting all that more with the double dic version"
5,THE MOVIE THAT SOLIDIFIES THE REASON WHY MOVIE-GOING IS STILL RELEVANT IN THE 21ST CENTURY!!!,"Now, this is the film in the entire trilogy that should've been the end to the Dark Knight saga...because it ""simply is the very best of the three!!!"" I've seen, and watched this film 4 times now...and I plan to see it again, and again, and so on.... My man, Heath Ledger truly gave the ""most incredible performance ever depicted of ""The Joker"" persona!!"" Bar none!!! And...Christian Bale as always ""showed us the man wearing the suit...NOT the suit wearing the man!!"" It' a damn shame, Christopher Nolan couldn't produce or direct a ""feasible, and plausible epilogue to ""The Batman Trilogy!?!?"" I'm hoping he comes back w/ the same cast intact for another go round w/ the Dark Knight...because after that ""unforgiving dreadful mess"" called ""The Dark Knight Rises"" we deserve a ""proper ending to our favorite anti-hero...wouldn't you guys agree!?"" -Mikey"
4,Watch all 3,"We made a day of it and watched Batman Begins, this and then headed to the theatre for Dark Knight Rises. Good times!"
2,If you are twenty something and hopped up on enough testosterone...,"If you are twenty something and hopped up on enough testosterone this film may provide exactly the right stimulus to arouse a fixated, intense reaction from barely contained obsessions, unbearable cravings and suppressed playground rages. For everyone else, it will be a stone cold snooze. Ridiculous, shallow, silly, childish and ultimately boring. It is also by turns sadistic, cruel, mean spirited and filled with dark psycho babble that passes for profundity. There are so many other ways this story could have been told, ways that this film could have been made, interesting, innovative ways. Fanboys may salivate and rant and rage at any suggestion that this cinematic drug was not the ultimate high. But the question remains: Will the Batman idea ever produce a good movie? Not here, not yet."
3,"Little too dark for me, but....","Little too dark for me, a 50 y/o female, but hubby loved it. Said it was the best so far."
4,Good blu-ray,"I won't go into a lot of details about the film itself since everyone has covered that. The blu-ray version is definitely worth a buy, because The Dark Knight is pretty ""dark"" in a lot of places, and you really get clarity in HD. Personally I thought Batman Begins was as better film with much more variety. This one is a little tedious with constant back and forth between Batman and the Joker, though Heath Ledger does come through with everything that's been said. The only thing wrong with these films is that the girlfriend is too ugly."
4,Great!,The video arrived before the intended date and was in great condition. I would recommend working with this company.
4,Only One Word: Epic,"There's huge hype that preceeds this one, particularly due to the unfortunate death of Heath Ledger. It's lead to critics of Ledger's performance claiming it is oscar-worthy, which would be unheard of for a comic book movie. Unlike the feel good plot ofIron Man (Single-Disc Edition), I've noticed young kids actually get a tad freaked out at the scariness of the Joker.Dark Knight is dark and gritty. Dark Knight is a big departure from the Tim Burton's gothic Gotham. This is not comic book. Rather it's grounded in a seemingly genuine US city which makes it that much more creepy. The well paced acting and dry satirical script make this flick somewhat a masterpiece."
4,No surprises here!,"This item was just as the seller described, and it was delivered so quickly. I'll definately be doing business with them again."
5,Happy Overall,Order shipped out quicker than I thought it would. received it timely and of course loved the movie. flawless transaction. thank you!
2,No digital copy included,"The format and versions box on the Amazon product description states "" Blu-Ray Widescreen edition + digital copy."" There is no digital copy. There are two discs. One is the movie with BD live. The other disc contains special features. There is no separate sheet with digital copy download information. Amazon's low price is deceptive."
5,The Dark Knight,"I absolutely love this movie, so I not only ordered one for my daughter for Christmas but ordered one for myself just because. My opinion, best Batman movie ever!!!"
5,The Dark Knight shines,"I am new the whole Blu Ray thing, but I've found out early that some movies can transform your living area into a movie theatre. This is one of those movies. The scenes shot in the IMAX format are amazing and ledger's portrayal of the Joker will forever make this a must own."
3,"batman, woooo",i still haven't watched it completely yet cuz i keep falling asleep but this movie is awesomeee!..from last time that i watched it before this copy of my own.eh on blue-ray since i don't get what the big fuss is about but wooo cuz this movie is great and with mucho action.
3,Al Franken is the Joker?!,"I seem to be in the minority, but this just wasn't as good as I expected. I much prefer ""Batman Begins"". Over analyzing, I find myself wondering how the Joker managed to set so many charges in the hospital...when did he or his ""little helpers"" find the time and opportunity? Stuff like that just bugged me. But, most of all (and I suppose one has to be from Minnesota to appreciate this), the Joker reminded me way too much of Al Franken. Al Franken with lipstick on. Looked like him. Sounded like him. Easy to dislike, sure, but still...disconcerting."
2,A waste of time,"Sure the acting is good but the plot is horrible. Lets just go shoot up the whole city and live to tell about it without any rhyme or reason about how the bad guys escape. The TV show was more intelligent. IMO, this move is absolute dreck."
4,Great movie. Alternating aspect ratios on Blu-ray annoying.,"I'm not reviewing the movie. That's been covered ad nauseam. I'm reviewing the Blu-ray disk. First the good points. The 1080p/VC-1 encode is excellent. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround Sound(48kHz/16-bit)audio is also excellent. Since I bought this movie to show off my HDTV and surround sound you'd think I'd be very happy. But I'm disappointed. The Dark Knight' is shown in alternating aspect ratios. The majority of the film is 2.40:1, while the IMAX-filmed segments are 1.78:1. I find this switching back and forth very distracting. Its not so bad during the long scenes, but during the short scenes it's very annoying. The IMAX filmed scenes also look better, which of course makes the regular shots look worse. All in all, it's not a bad Blu-ray movie, but I'm definitely not a fan of the alternating aspect ratios."
4,Good Movie,"As far as ""superhero"" movies go its probably the best I have seen so far. The joker made this movie great. Although I do not think the movie itself deserved an oscar I do think Heath Ledger did. He redefined the concept of ""arch-criminal""."
5,Special Edition is the 'Better' Edition...,"If you look at the regular DVD & the Special Edition DVD of the The Dark Knight, it would be wise & worth it to spend a little more money to get the Special Edition version. It's loaded with extras & a digital copy, which proves to be the better copy of this movie."
3,I bought this product for my son. He likes this movie.,My son likes this movie. I ordered it for him. The quality seemed to be good. It was a good price for the product.
1,awful seller,I had been wanting the dark knight movie for awhile. I found it on amazon and saw that it was the one that had the slip cover that goes over the blu ray the inequality that i wanted so i bought it. Now it said it was the blu ray two disc special edition and came with the digital copy. Well when i got the movie it didn't have the slip cover the package was open when it said it was brand new. There was only the blu ray and no digital copy when i contacted the seller they told me that there not goin to give me a replacement one the right one that i paid for. I contacted amazon and they did the a to z form and they gave me my money back so i would rate this not even one star
3,i'm very upset.,"The Dark Knight Blu-ray well-received. The contents were completely without moreConfiguration was good. But no matter, even private sellers on Amazon U.S.Does the product were sent to Canada to say thrilled? Will be too upset.Amazon Sellers ""It makes you regret salgeol. hey, intervideo is the best teacherHope you have had this happen. I've seen the movie. Awesome picture quality andHas left a sound impression. Thank you."
3,Jamuny,"I finally watched this video the other night. It starts out very slow but then takes off with a 'shot'. It is a very 'dark' movie as all have said before me, but not it's too awfully dark emotionally as I had anticipated. It is shot in a dark cinema mode for affect. I liked the movie, though, I could not help thinking about the demise of Heath Ledger and was overcome with thoughts of his daughter who will never know him.His perfomance was good! Christian Bale and Gary Oldman, who have been overlooked, also gave good perfomances for this genre,but due to the controversy surrounding Mr. Ledger's death they have been overlooked, but that's just my opinion.I pray for Mr. Ledger'sfamily. I also pray that in time his last performance as an actor will not be over shadowed by his death.This is a definate See It!"
5,The Dark Knight,"The best movie based on a comic book hero ever!!! They might as well stop making Batman movies after this. There is no way they can top this.With great acting and a great story, Also great Action you have to see this."
1,Ripped off!,"This 2-disc Special Edition DVDs deserve negative stars. There should be a class action lawsuit against Warner Brothers for misleading/false advertising. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed The Dark Knight movie. However, the 2-disc Special Edition DVDs made me vomit. There were no deleted scenes, no director commentary, no cast and crew interviews, etc. on the second disc. If Kevin Smith had bought these DVDs he would tell Warner Brothers to smoke his big fat !@#$. Allow me to make the conjecture that Warner Brothers is going to release an ""Ultimate Edition"" of The Dark Knight in order to milk the fans. I for one would like a refund of my $15 IMAX ticket and $20.99 for the DVDs please.If you must have The Dark Knight, go with the single disc."
3,Darkly violent movie,"Wasn't sure what to expect, there has been so much hype about the film along with Heath Ledger's demise soI wondered if it would be a big disappointment, it wasn't. It was very well acted by all concerned, excellent special effects, some really DARK moments, all that have been described to death in other reviews, such as the mobile phone in the stomach, blowing people up etc along with the Joker, the amazing Heath Ledger (I liked him better in a Knight's Tale but he is pretty good in Dark Knight) running around Gotham City like maddened clown on prozac, not to mention Michael Caine as Batman's butler, and Batman himself, a troubled soul who doesn't know if he himself is good or bad?Worth going to see if you really the big cinema experience but I would have been happy to wait for it to come out on DVD, it was good but it's not in my top ten of movies."
1,VHS VERSION?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"Ok, i find it stupid and asinine that they only release this product for BR (bleu-raes) and DVD (direct video demand), but NOT for VHS (video home system)!!!!!!!!! year after year i see less and less films available for VHS! this sucks! my collection is completely ruined if i conform and start buying BRs or DVDs--the cases are too skinny and look RETARDED next to my good old VHS discs! PLEASE release this one on VHS! i just LOVE Hairy Potter and want it sooo hard on home media!"
4,Votes seem a bit low,"The original modern BATMAN with Michael Keaton remains one of my favorite comic book action movies. Although it has some humorous parts it is basically a drama. BATMAN FOREVER is much more tongue-in-cheek, tries to be much more witty, and succeeds much of the time. Val Kilmer is OK as Bruce Wayne and Batman, but Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are just out of their minds good as the evil nemeses of society and Batman. So much so that it almost becomes their movie, with Batman finding his new partner, Robin (Chris O'Connell), a circus trapeze performer, as almost a side story. Nicole Kidman, as we have become accustomed, is just perfect as Wayne's love interest. I don't rate this film very highly, probably ""7"" on a 10-point scale, but with a very aggressive sound track, and really vile villians, it is entertaining if you like the genre."
1,return the dark knight,This product was not new as advertised. The front cover had a bunch of indentations on it and plastic pieces were broken so the case wouldn't even close. Also missing carboard case w/ Batman on the bike which it would have if product was really new.
2,Horrible apologia for the Iraq war,"The reason this gets a second star is that Heath Ledger is, of course, just as good as Heath Ledger was, and there are other very fine performances, not to mention beautiful design etc - a beautifully made movie. There's only one problem: it's evil. It's a senseless, cynical effort to rationalize and moralize senseless, cynical violence, with very direct suggestions that dehumanization and cruelty are the only possible responses to terrorism, that acts of violence by others leave us no choice.I love a lot of violent spectacles and movies that dish up their share of sexism etc., but this one was no fun - it was creepy and depressing and weirdly didactic, and I felt betrayed walking out of the theater, like I'd be tricked out of a bit of my soul."
2,More Hollywood BS,"With the exception of the great acting by Heath Ledger, this film was another Hollywood predictable yawner. I couldn't wait for the movie to end."
1,What a pile of crap,"Just proves yet again how the right amount of hype can propel a movie to new record heights, remember a dreadful movie called Titanic and the current Billion dollar mess Avatar.I guess like anything , might as well rent it for 99 cents from Redbox, but don't waste anymore money on this Donkey."
1,Check your brains at the door.,"After the 3rd attempt at trying to watched this movie I finally didn't fall alseep and watched the complete movie, now I wished I did fall asleep like the first two times. What a waste of time. How the hell did the Joker planned all these plots, plans, bombs, killings while Batman compliants that he can't find him. This movie is a ""joke"". And the joke is on us. This is a mindless piece of junk that you have to suspend all intelligence and logic to actually endured it. I was so bore then so angry that i just had to write this review to blow off some steam. Batman Begins was great, It's so sad that this movie didn't continue the greatness of that film. If you didn't see the movie yet, stay far away but it's probably too late."
2,Scenes were cutout,"There clearly are some scenes that have been cutout of the original theatrical release. For those who didn't get to see the theatrical version, it might not make a difference. But having watched it twice in the theaters, its hard to not notice the scenes being cutout, the movie does not flow well. I hope they release a unrated version soon."
2,Dark Knight..Dreary Night,"I would have given this 1 star but I appreciate the production values, so it gets a big 2.If you like ""downer"" movies, then this is the film for you.Without going into specifics, liekable characters are killed, a psychotic murderer/terrorist wreaks death and havoc and gets away with it all, and our hero is chastised and forced into exile because he was politically incorrect in his surveillance methods to try and save the lives of countless Gothamites.Next to the dreadful QUANTUM OF SOLACE travesty, the 2nd most dissappointing film of the year. Still, check it out if you haven't seen it, and judge for yourself."
1,Don't buy for digital download,"I bought this for the digital copy, which is a disc that you can copy to your computer(I wanted it in my iTunes for my iTv and iPhone) The problem however is that those codes expire(now I know)and this movie's digital download rights expired last December."
3,"Too dark direction, hides choreography","I had watched this movie in the cinemas. But, i'm afraid i prefer the previous bat man movies!Christopher Nolan has the habit of hiding action choreography with dark scenes, and quick micro view of fighting sequences which makes me wonder what when by. Honestly, I cannot savour the action scenes half the time, 'cos they are either hidden by the dark lighting or a partial micro view of the action!Sorry such direction may fool the rather imaginative audience who rely totally on their subconcious imagination for action, but not me. I am not convinced of the shortchanging action sequence. My ultimate hero movie is still the Spiderman trilogy, where you can savour clearly the action sequence that is really a mastery of action hero movies at its finest."
3,Inconvenient blu case,"The bat pot is made of plastic, detailed and nice but for a blu ray collector the case could be inconvenient. I would rate it more if additional to the bat case the package includes the regular blue box."
3,Same discs?,"Did anyone's set come with the same exact two discs inside the mask? My brother and I both received this from our mom on Christmas. I know the discs looks the same outside, but I put both in the dvd player and they have the same exact content on them. Anyone else find this? Wtf?"
3,"great batman movie , bad batman blu-ray","I got a blu-ray version ""The Dark Knight""sound is good , but picture quality is not badalmost even that standard DVD I thinkThat's disappointedand this Bluray's most of the problem is mixed IMAX filmBecause , there's aspect ratio will changing in sometimeI been annoying while I watchingThis is not really movieI don't like thisWhat does Christopher Nolan thinking ?If standard DVD is not including IMAXI have to buy it again"
1,Not just juvenile but infantile,"I guess this kind of movie speaks to a certain kind of sensibility that I simply do not and cannot share. Everything is so one-dimensional: the characters, the plot, the look. It is relentlessly and mindlessly violent. It seems to have only one emotion to express and that is one of rage. It is like an orchestral arrangement where every instrument is playing on every beat of every measure. My Batman comics from the '60s display greater dynamics in emotion and execution. And since they were written for your average ten-year-old, what type of mentality is a film like this supposed to reach?"
1,"Disappointed in the film, in any version.","The amount of violence in this film is disturbing for anyone, let alone the PG-13 designation. I expected comic book violence in the film, but I was appalled at the mass destruction and menace that smacks of terrorism, and haven't we had enough of that? Is this what the creator of Batman intended?Moreover, while the plot of choosing good over evil is admirable, Ifeel that the sub-plot of masking good as evil for the sake of theorder, is manipulative and dishonest. Sure it's a good ploy for settingup future Batman films, but it's merely setting the stage for more ofthe same old stuff. How much violence and bad-boy heroes do we really needto be entertained?"
1,"Too long, too dark, too much Joker, interminable","If you are not related to somebody in this movie and don't feel compelled to see every single Batman movie, I do not know why you would subject yourself to this. The Joker is memorable, but I don't want this in my memory. The only actors who I could understand were the Joker (who has about an hour of vamping over the course of the movie. Creepy, yes, but way too much.), the district attorney, Rachel, Batman's valet and tech guy. Other protagonists -- like Batman -- I could not understand what they were saying most of the time. So the dark movie did not make much sense. Dunno or care if it was how the actors spoke or how they were miked or mixed. Maybe if I could understand them I would have cared more. But I doubt it. Seemed like no plot, just ""this happened, then this happened, then this happened..."" for over two hours. I was very glad when it was over. I would never, ever sit through a minute of it again."
2,The Boring Knight,"I'm watching the end of the movie as I write this review. Too long. No characters to really like or care for. Too violent. Too cruel. Extremely thin plot (like all Batman movies). Ridiculous body count. Even with my surround sound and 1080p upconverting Sony DVD player, it can't be saved. Nice special effects, but those don't make a movie. If Ledger hadn't died tragically prior to the release, many of the reviews and ratings would likely be less kind. 'nuff said.Other reviews say this is the best Batman movie to date. Perhaps, but the previous outings were even worse.And was I the only one wanting to give Batman a Ricola?Thankfully, it was a free rental!"
1,Hated it,"I was a big fan of batman, but not a big fan of this movie. The effects were ok, the storyline was trash"
4,Not for use in a computer,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. It comes with a code for downloading a digital copy -- which apparently you REALLY need, since the DVD won't play in his computer in any watchable way even after updating his media player. I also find the sound really annoying on this DVD -- we have to constantly adjust it up for hard-to-hear dialogue and down for the incredibly loud music. A friend found hers wouldn't even play properly in her DVD player. So ... yeah, it's the movie and he loves that movie. But save the receipt until you're sure it works, and keep track of that digital copy code because the disk production is funky."
2,Video on Demand is very flawed as the file is most of the time corrupt.,"Amazon Unbox Video on Demand is very flawed as the file is most of the time corrupt. I download the Dark Knight twice because the first time, there are several corrupt points on the file, so I can't seek/fastforward/rewind. The second time there is only a couple of corrupt points on the file, i'm able to seek/fastforward/rewind but the player will hang/stop when it reaches the corrupt point. I may have to download it a couple more times to get a non-corrupt file."
4,Another good batman tale but getting darker,"I appreciate the batman movies but this one, and judging by the latest previews of the new one, continue on the path to being darker and darker and less appropriate for the kids who used to be able to watch these with their parents."
3,disappointing DVD,"stunning picture on the blu ray release of this DVD but the aspect ratio changing throughout the entire picture is distracting and annoying.also, the most of the spoken dialogue is very difficult to hear.love the film - hate the DVD."
5,Best comic book movie of all time,"I can't stop my desire to re-watch the film. Although the performance of Heath Ledger may be in the top 10 performances of all time, the part of this amazing movie that moved me the most was the score. It was quietly beyond perfect if that is even possible. Watch this movie & watch it again!"
2,The best movie of 2008 gets a mediocre Special Edition treatment,"This movie is fantastic on all fronts- I've seen it 3 times and can't get enough. Seeing it at the IMAX was one of my most fondest summer memories and still is. I made a vow to buy the movie when it got released......and I did. As much as I love having it on DVD, I was VERY let down by the DVD. The ""Sounds of Anarchy"" feature was interesting but it was just about the song ""Why So Serious?"", a suite that's 2 notes and runs 9 minutes long. I didn't want to see about like 5 minutes of a cellist playing 2 notes. The batsuit thingy was interesting but way too short. It's nice to have the IMAX scenes, but can't we watch them WITH the movie???? And the Gotham City newscasts... *snore*. Boring!!!So overall, DO buy the movie if you want the movie on DVD, but choose your poison carefully- get the one disc instead. You'll be happier."
5,No director's commentary,"Amazing film, very dissapointed that this film didn't include a director's commentary in the Special Features."
4,"""Great Batman Sequel!""","Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart,Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman star in this 2008 actionsequel. Bruce Wayne/Batman fights crime in Gotham Cityand faces psychotic clown criminal, ""The Joker."" Heathwas the heart of the film and was brilliant. Aaron alsodid good as Harvey Dent and this 2-disc set has nicepicture and sound, but I wish it had more extras.Get this great Batman sequel."
4,masks????,we all wear masks for one reason or another. this cool disc-mask thing is nice. i thought it would ruin the discs......since many of these type of designs usually do.....but it doesn't. and if you want the movie on your ipod.....it has a disc for that too.the movie was a little long for my taste......it could've gone a bit faster near the end. but...overall......an amazing last-full performance by heath ledger. may he rest in peace. and a different side to christian bale his other movies have yet to produce. 'A'
3,Three Stars - spoilers follow,"Christian Bale returns as Batman in the sequal the Dark Knight. Once again he does not fail in bring the goods. He was a talent actor. The same goes to the late Heath Ledger in his Joker. Before the Joker was always a silly villain in previous Batman movies but in this one he is an awsome, twisted villain you can't take your eyes off. The sequal packs a lot action and twists I didn't see coming. Like Batman deciding to save the District Attorney rather then Rachel whom I assume he would. The District Attorney becomes the second villain in the movie as that act and his disfigurement transforms him from the good hearted hero to villain. You can see and understand why he falls from grace which has always been one of my favorite things to watch. The only problem the Dark Knight has though is it drags on and on. When you think its over it contiunes on and on."
4,"Phenomenal film, unexpected Bluray quirk","I have no complaints on the actual film portion of this movie. It is some of Christopher Nolan's finest work and features excellent acting. I have never seen a more believable joker, and as a Batman fangirl, I can tell you that this is the best Batman movie I have ever seen. The Bluray disc, however, had an unexpected ""feature."" While this movie looks amazing in full HD, and I fully recommend buying it in Bluray, you should know that some of the scenes were shot specifically for IMAX. These scenes have a different aspect ratio than the rest of the film. As a result, some of the movie, it will fill your entire television screen, and then other portions of the movie will have the black bar effect. It's an annoying quirk to the Bluray, and I'm not sure why they didn't fix it somehow. That said, if you buy the movie on Bluray, you will be stunned by how much better it looks than the DVD rendering."
4,Awesome Movie,"This movie was better than expected. I think the movie was one of the best action movies ever made. Batman Begins was not better than the sequel, in my opinion, and I think that Heath Ledger played the Joker very well. I wish Heath Ledger was still alive today and could see the movie. I also thought Christian Bale was very good in the movie as well. This is one of my favorite movies and I'm looking forward to the next movie in this series."
3,Does not live up to the hype,"This movie was a disappointment. It was so hyped up by the press that I thought for sure it was going to be absolutely amazing, but it's not as good as Batman Begins, overall. The plot is weak, the dialogue is boring, and it's hard to follow. Not because the plot is intricate, but because the story is just disconnected and vague in places. Heath Ledger delivers a great performance as Joker--that's the best thing about this movie. Most of the rest is hype. Cool special effects and a lot of action, as you would expect, though.Not as bad of as sequel as the latest Indiana Jones flop, but just not as good as I was expecting...."
2,Digital Copy Expired,"I bought this DVD from Amazon because it stated that there was a digital copy. My son wanted the digital copy for his Ipod. When I received it, there is no digital copy. The digital copy expired on 12/9/09 and I received it today 12/15/09. My plans were to give this DVD to my son as part of his Christmas. I am disappointed about the expiration of the digital copy. This should have not been put in the fine print at the end of the description. Instead it should have been placed at the top for people to plainly see."
4,"Talented cast, great direction","In the hands of the director, Christopher Nolan, THE DARK KNIGHT works extremely wellOur super-hero is not super clean. Great.Much talk about Heath Ledger, and he was great, but really, all of the actors were wonderful.Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Eric Roberts and the rest of the cast add to the final tally, which is a very entertaining movieThe story, the production design, the score, the stunts and special effects are also great too."
2,Special Features are a Joke... On Us! Movie looks great.,"Of course its the best superhero movie ever made! So hook us up with what?!!!! Terrible foray into the blu ray market. This is a FAN MOVIE!!!! How the studio failed to figure this out when they designed the special features eludes me. I mean are stupid people running the show?! If you just want to see the movie in high def well you got to buy it. But when you find out that some producer spent all the special features budget on some six episodes of fictional seventh grader level banter to no end and you cant stand to watch any more, prepare for disappointment."
5,Excellent.,"The Caped Crusader is portrayed brilliantly in this movie. The storyline is deep and therefore the film may require more than one viewing to be ""fully taken in"" and understood. Joker's portrayal by Heath Ledger was absolutely amazing to say the least. Honor has once again been brought to the legend of the Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan and his crew. Well done!"
5,PSP Movies,"One of the best action movies ever, available for the PSP.Enjoy the epic struggle of Batman vs. Joker in Christopher Nolan's vision of The Dark Knight.Now you can take this portable version on vacation, travel, or to the gym for 2 1/2 hours of movie watching."
4,Worth seeing,I had seen Beginnings and my son had said that Dark Knight was his favorite so I got it from Amazon and did like it. The only thing I can say is that I wish that Amazon offered sub-titles. I don't like it when I miss something and feel there is a point I don't understand.
3,Hot & cold,"I loved Batman Begins, so I was eagerly anticipating seeing The Dark Knight! Especially given all the hype it received.After watching it on DVD, I felt very mixed about it. Heath Ledger was great, he definitely deserves all the praise he got for this role. The main characters are fine as well.The problems I had with the movie is that it's way too long, for one thing. Dent's character wasn't needed in this series yet. The editing wasn't as good as the first movie in that there were parts that made no sense and should have been cut.For instance, Gordon fakes his own death to keep his family out of harms way. Nice idea by itself. But then once he's back ""alive"" again his family gets taken by Harvey Dent anyway! So much for that plan.I started to get bored in some places. Again, it was just too long and unfocused for me. It had some great spots, but not enough for me to recommend this as anything better than a so-so movie."
4,"Looks great in HD, but grainy","Dark Knight is one awesome film, and the transfer to Blu ray is quite amazing. The audio is superb, and the Joker's theme sounds very eerie hearing it in surround sound. Blu ray audio on the pS3 with a Denon soundbar makes it sound just amazing.The film looks fantastic, with some graininess. I guess the film was shot in digital so the graininess is standard fare (that's just my guess). You can see all the detail on the suits, and everything just looks lifelike on screen. This is not the best movie to display the true capabilities of HD because the film is dark, but for audiophiles, you need to hear this one.A ton of specials, BD live, plus digital copy to transfer onto your iPod makes this a great buy. Definitely check out Hans Zimmer special on the disc to hear how he created the Joker's theme. It's brilliant!"
1,Most overrated movie ever made.,"This and Citizen Kane are the two most overrated films ever made. Admit it, you probably wouldn't have even watched this movie if Heath hadn't died like he did."
1,"Just what we need: a violent, intense film - marketed to kids","What's worse? Giving a violence, creepy, intense film - that should have been rated R - a PG-13 rating = ""bring the kids"" ... or all the toys and movie tie-ins associated with it? Hey, why not start marketing cigarettes to kids again? What's with marketing a film like this to children??? Why not have toys based on ""Saw II?"""""
1,Studios cheap out again.,Again only 5 channel audio for such a huge release. The studios are really getting lazy and putting out trash. For this reason alone I cannot take Blu-ray seriously. Until we start really utilizing the technology this format is a lost. I'd expect at least a DTS ES 6 channels or ideally full 7 channel HD audio. For this reason I would suggest people boycott buying these HD formats simply because the studios and Sony are ripping people off.
2,Somebody Saw Me Coming,"Love the movie, hate that I blew $15 on this DVD. Must've been asleep at the wheel when I ordered. Received the 1-disc widescreen, no extras. Feel like a dope. Chalk up one more to experience."
2,Special features???,"I spent the extra $6 to get the two disc special edition, hoping there would be some good features. It was NO WHERE NEAR WORTH IT. No behind the scenes, just production stills. That's what I want to watch on my tv, photographs with no sound. Another greedy corporation takes its claws to another work of art. BOO warner brothers. No wonder Zappa hated you."
4,Intense,"An intense, dark drama which does justice to the DC comic tradition! Maybe too intense for younger children. I recommend it!"
3,It's just okay,"I was pretty excited to get this dvd considering all the hype about how great the movie is, however, I was pretty disappointed after watching it! This movie is okay but it is not the ""oscar-worthy"" movie that people like to say it is. Like I said in the title...it's just okay. The three stars are for the quality of the blu-ray, not the movie itself."
4,Great Movie!,"I saw this movie in theatres and absolutely loved it! The plot is solid, and I like the eery sense of evil as well as the psychological struggle of the characters throughout the movie that most other films are too afraid to present."
2,WAY to dark !!!!!,i hate this movie so muck that i even like batman and robin 1997 better !!!. the reason i hate this movie is the joker he is way to crazy to the extreme and the action is bad and it is violent and when i have kids i would rather make them watch batman and robin 1997 . i give this a 1/4 i am disappointed of this movie
2,Should be rated R,"This movie is advertised as a PG-13 but it clearly should have been rated R. The content of this movie includes very violent stuff; among others, torture and serial murder. It's s serious departure from previous Batman films, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that this movie should be rated R (period). We bought it so our kids could watch and were shocked at how similar the content of this film is to movies like Saw and Touristas."
3,"Still a ""comic-book-movie""","Heath Ledger is marvelous in his final role, and that should be enough to go see the film or rent it in some months time. But be warned that all the hype come from a crowd that consider ""comic-book-movies"" as the epitome of cinema. The movie is all metaphor, and some action sequences. And it is not exactly subtle when it tells you about good and evil. Maybe the readers of this lines will think that the film reflects the world's despair in bleak times, but in fact those Grey days are American ones. As with all the other ""comic-book-movies"" of this decade (I didn't see the latest Del Toro yet) this film will be lost in time as were the serials of yore. Entertaining?, yes. Depressing?, you bet. A classic?, is not, so better put your coins for that goal into ""Wall-E"", clear winner of the relevancy contest."
2,"Too long, too much dialog...","The spent way too much time trying to make you care about the story, which no one does. Stick to the action - that's what comic books are about."
5,Batman Review,"This movie was bought for someone else, but I heard it was a great movie,so I gave it 5 stars."
5,Batman is at it again,Excellent Batman Movie. Deffinately a keeper. And the seller sent it to me right away.
5,Great price,I ordered this as a gift for my husband. I couldn't believe how quickly it arrived. It was exactly what I ordered and was the perfect gift.
5,Wow!,"The Joker portrayed by Heath Ledger is done so well its chilling. The movie is great and all but Heath's joker is the highlight of the movie, hands down! I've watched thousands of movies and I've never experienced anything like this, his joker was just surreal, I'm just in awe of how amazing he done. Each time I watch The Dark Knight, I try to understand the character more and more, he is so sick, disturbing and demented its mind blowing. Heath will be missed and this role was memorable performance like no other. The movie is awesome all together, the way they tied the story together is cool, and Bale's performance is solid, I only wish that ""the other villain"" got to stick around longer, maybe get carried on to the next Batman movie."
4,Excellent movie!,"My husband and I loved this movie. A great Batman addition! It's PG-13 due to the darkness of the moive, but very well done (in other words, I won't be showing it to my little kids)."
3,Movie great,"I saw the movie in Imax when it was released. I thought the movie was very good, and well worth the money and time. Dark is right.I previously stated that I could only watch this on my Mac, but now I found that my old LG unit was failing. I just hooked up a newPanasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-ray Disc Player, Blackplayer, and it did just fine."
4,DVD's,Gift for my grown grandson for christmas--was on his wish list.Amazon is the best place to obtain DVD--Quality place to shop.
4,BATMAN,"I almost always enjoy anything Batman, being a fan from childhood, many years ago.This film of course has some bitter sweet points to it, with the death of the star of the film.There are parts to this film that makes it a bit too realistic and removes the viewer from the 'fantasy' film.Many lines are truely believable as being the Joker's reason for his scars. It's not too far from what we hear on the news these days.Alfred's line, 'some people just like to see the world burn', is very striking and true. Probably the strongest line of wisdom he has ever given.In one scene, after the explosion of a building, it is very reminescent of the scenes from the WTC.Parts of this film strike a little too close to reality.Still, a very good film.For me, not worth all the hype, but I do look forward to the next and hopefully they won't all be ruined like the last several Batman movies."
3,Hmm...,"The trend of film remakes in Hollywood concerns me. This movie is considerably darker and more gritty than the first Batman movie. Dark isn't always bad, but was this film really necessary? The Joker didn't really feel like the Joker. Mind you, Heath Ledger did a good job in his role, but the role itself did not really fit. If you like Batman, stick with the original movies - Jack Nicholson did an awesome job as the Joker in the first. Definitely rent this movie before you actually decide to buy, this movie will only appeal to certain tastes. I especially did not like the Joker's backstory in this one.However, the first film in this series was much better and more coherent."
3,Nice Movie and Bluray but missing Hard Paper Cover,This is a very nice movie and Bluray disc quality is excellent.But Packing not good.Amazon didnt ship me the bluray with Hard Paper Cover.That not good.It suppose to come with that perticular cover.So dont go with the pictures shown for the disc discription.
1,Lies. Dont trust.,"First up, the movie, The Dark Knight is great. The item I'm reviewing is not.1) The description is false. IT IS NOT THREE DISCS'. THERE IS NOT DIGIAL COPY.2) The cover/Steal booklet feels cheap and very generic,3) Way overprice for the lack of content and quality.4) ...There is no content other then the movie, which amazed me since they state it's a special edition.5) It is not universal region coded.I personally have already contacted Amazon (which by the way has always been extremely cooperative regarding these sorts of matters) on the grounds of a refund. Nil concerns voiced."
5,The Dark Knight IS Heath Ledger,"Mr. Heath Ledger made a great movie, and this will go down in history as his finest hour. NO one has ever played the Joker quite like he does. He has it down to making you think he might be a villian in real life. Which we all know he wasn't. But he scored 5 stars from my whole family. This is the best Batman because of Heath Ledger and Christian Bale."
4,Glory and Fire,"I enjoyed the Dark Knight, including the late Heath Ledger who played the Joker and Christian Bale who played Batman. Can't wait Batman Rises w/ bad guy Bane."
3,Story was not compelling,"I heard so much about this series, so maybe my expectations were too high. The batman character seems so flat and, yes, I know he is a comic book character. Also, I felt the actor's choice for Batman's voice was too distracting. The visual effects and design were quite well done and enjoyable to watch, however."
3,itunes version did not work,the itunes version did not worked so I guess you are better off getting it somewhere else and get the cheaper dvdthe movie is by far the best batman ever!!!
5,Another great find,"Great movie, excellent price from ""Lightening Deals"". Thank you so much!! My daughter really liked this Batman movie and wanted it for Christmas. I'm glad that I'm able to put it under the tree for her. =)"
4,Great Movie,"This continuation of the reboot of the Batman franchise delivers strongly. I watched the earlier Batman movies, which were fine for their time, but Christian Bale is the ""real"" Batman to me now."
5,Awsome movie! Action packed from start to finish.,"The Dark Knight has the best possible actors for all of its characters. Action packed, creepy, funny and all around entertaining.Most people consider this the best Batman movie. I agree."
3,The REALLY LONG night,"This movie is not as good as the first installment of this series. My first problem is the length of this thing- it seems to just go on and on. The second is that there really isn't any suspense, and you actually just don't care about how things come out. Most of the plot twists may be seen about an hour before they occur- they've been done so much better in other movies. And, you tire of watching what seems to be an endless series of psuedo intellectual dialoge punctuated by scenes of predictable and overdone violence. The special effects are good, but the action scenes eventually get to be ludicrous and even silly.I have to agree that Heath Ledger did an excellent job- much more than I expected, but the rest of the cast lets him down."
3,"Fantastic movie, HORRIBLE sound editing","This movie is a hit in our house. The acting is just superb. Rarely do I watch a movie and forget I'm watching a movie, but that happens here. Gary Oldman is fantastic as Commissioner Gordon, Christian Bale is the best Batman ever, and Maggie Gyllenhall is such an improvement over Katie Holmes there are no words.My only beef with this movie is the sound editing. If you have the volume at a normal level to hear the conversations between the characters, when the action starts you're pretty much blasted by the explosions; I find myself constantly having to adjust the sound while I watch, and keep the subtitles on so that if the sound is okay for the action, we can still understand what people are saying. Hopefully when the next one comes to DVD, the sound editing will be better."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I don't understand what is so great about this movie. It's a good action flick, but not the best or most exciting.The opening scene was really good, but after that the movie got dull. If it weren't for Heath Ledger's performance, I would have not bothered watching at all. Everyone else, except for Eric Roberts who was pretty cool in his small part, was boring as heck.""Iron Man"" is a much better super hero movie."
4,Excellent Item,The Dark Knight(2-Disc Special Edition) is a gr8 addition to anyone's DVD collection.....The Dics quality is good....Sound quality is good though it can be bettered....& Special Bonus features are up to the mark in keepin with the special edition tag.Definitely A good collector's Item.
5,Another hit by Nolan,"I was never into the Batman movies until Nolan took the franchise under his arm. I bought the first one in the saga (Batman Begins) for my husband who loved the movie and I got into it as much as he did. As soon as the second movie came out, he went to see it with his friends. Then I bought the movie from Amazon. Excellent quality, both concerning the product itself and the movie, as well. We're currently waiting for the third movie, which we both went to see at the theater together. We have already put it on our wish list here in Amazon. Just waiting for the price to go down a bit. If you liked the first Nolan Batman movie, you're going to love this one, too... and the third one (hopefully, he'll keep it going beyond a third one.)"
3,Good but Violent,I would have liked to view less violence in the film. Scariest Joker I've seen !Worth watching but not a family movie
4,Good continuation of the series,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. We watched it together after all the company left. It is good, but is very long and as the title indicates, is pretty dark. Heath Ledger is amazing as the Joker."
5,Awesome Move,The blu-ray version is crisp and clear. The movie itself is superbly acted and a thrill for any Batman lover.
2,"i never actually got my product, the seller never sent it and wont respond to emails","i never got my product, the seller stole my money and never sent the item."
2,Hugely overrated...,Vastly overrated...the movie is too long and there are too many eye-rolling scenes such as Harvey Dent roaming the city with half his face missing and his eyeball ready to fall out if his head. Heath Ledger is good but his psycho act grows tiresome. Batman is not a likable character either and whats with the voice.Very disappointing...
1,Won't play on my system because of copy protection,"Bought this DVD, found it won't play on my system because of copy protection. This product should come with a warning, ""Don't expect to be able to play this DVD, we've disabled that for your 'protection'."""
1,Im buyed a Bluray and received only dvds!,Yes im buyed the Bluray version but im received a 3 disc dvd version.Ver y very dissapointed with this scam.
5,YOU MEANT JOKER THE MOVIE,"BEST BAT MAN MOVIE I'VE SEEN, TIE WITH THE FIRST BATMAN. ALTHOUGH, I REALLY THINK THEY SHOULD CALL THIS MOVE:""THE JOKER"" BECAUSE BATMAN FEELS LIKE A SIDE CHARACTER IN THIS ONE."
1,No thanks.,"This has to be the most overrated movie of all-time! I heard about how amazing it was so for the first time in years I finally left my house and actually went to see it- a triumph alone! Let me tell you, this movie was such a disappointment. I hated it. I was close to sleeping throughout the whole film. It was generic, predictable and downright horrendous. If you want true entertainment check out some films by the great director Uwe Boll."
1,this movies was so bad i fell asleep,"the fact that everyone thinks that heath ledger made a good joker is unbelievable it just shows that no one has seen the batman made in the early 90's starring jack nicholson, i will admit that christian bale has made some good movies (equilibrium for example) but this is sad that heath ledgers final performace was so bad. the man is a good actor but his portrayel of the joker was completely and utterly wrong in keeping with the actual character from the comic books. he looks different acts different and does not use tactics as crude as the ones that they had him using in this farce"
1,Comic book characters... making millions of horrible movies these days.,"You people these days consider this a good movie? Haha. Who in their right mind believes that a bat character that drives a Pontiac Firebird clone can save the world from evil?For good and REAL action check out WWE, ECW, or TNA."
2,Without Ledger this would have been total farce,"Long, boring flick. Ledger alone kept me interested, every other part of this movie stunk. What the heck was with Batman's voice...? Get that man a butter menthol or at least make him clear out the phlegm. He sounded absurd."
1,Terrible video mastering!!,"Everything you've heard about how bad the ""standard definition"" DVD looks is all too true. I rented DK before purchasing it, and couldn't believe how grainy and filled with artifacts it was! This with an Oppo 983H upscaling player -- the best in the business. Even at 16 feet away, I could see the horrible quality defects on my 46"" Samsung LCD.I firmly believe the studio released this DVD poorly mastered with the full intent of making the blu-ray version look far superior. This hasn't been the case with countless other ""standard"" DVDs. A sleazy marketing ploy. Avoid this one like the plague!!"
5,Dark Knight,This is a great movie. The extended version really adds to the version I saw at the theatre. Christian Bale is the best Batman ever.
2,Poor design,"The Blu-ray discs are stored in the slim case which is placed by the Batpod. If you want to put your Batpod on your desk or in a display cabinet, the discs will not be sitting with your movie collection. This is my main gripe because I like all my movies in one place. The DVD which contains Digital Copy comes in a sleeve. In short you don't get any typical Blu-ray/DVD case.The Batpod itself is a bit small, and looks like typical Chinese workmanship. If you really want a Batpod, I would suggest buying the normal Blu-ray version that comes in Blu-ray's blue case, and get a bigger, quality Batpod from else where.The movie is a solid 5 star."
5,Movie of the year,"When I saw batman begins a few years ago I was greatly disappointed. The movie was boring and I fell asleep. I forced myself out of my house and dragged my body to the theater to see Dark Knight. All my friends said it was good even though they like horrible flicks I still went.BAM! Straight in my face, from the beginning I was on the edge of my seat. Cristian Bale is not my favorite batman but he sort of manages to pull it off.When I knew heath ledger was in this movie I didn't know what to expect. He did an excellent job of playing the psychotic joker.This movie was dark and violent and it grasped the concept of choas and a hero to keep it in check.I hope they choose the riddler for the next film. Then the movie quote will be ""Riddle me this"" instead of ""why so serious?""DC comics released Dark Knight graphic novels back in the 90's. So keep the ignorance to a minimum"
5,"But, will it work in my blu-ray player?","My only question is, will the BluRay disk work on existing players? The studios have a history of releasing disks with features they either forgot to tell the player manufacturers about, or the player manufacturers ignored. I have purchased BluRay disks and had to wait three months for an update from the player manufacturer in order for my player to play the disk. This is very frustrating, so much so I quit buying blu-ray disks until 3-6 months after their release so I would know the player will actually play the disk. The recent Bond disks are but one example of many.My suggestion is to wait a few weeks after this is released before buying it, and read the reviews here or on one of the AV websites, just to be sure it will work on your player. Otherwise, you could be disappointed at Christmas by not being able to watch the movie."
4,Directors cut,"Heard rumours that a Nolan cut thats over 3 hours is going to be released for the big screen. I guess that would be the version to get. The problem with all these ""epic blockbusters"" is that there will be infinite versions in the future, and if you're old enough, you'll probably remember the laser disc days and T2 e.g. I don't know how many versions and box sets came out on laser disc and then it continued on DVD. Look at Blade Runner :)"
4,The Dark Knight,This was a good movie. Heath Ledger did put his spin on the joker. I was surprised about the change of MS. Daws but I can't complain she did a good job too. I believe that Batman Begins was the better movie though. Dark Knight did not seem to have as much action in it. I do recommend watching the movie.
2,don't buy used dvd,"I purchased this used dvd movie which was claimed to be ""used, very good"". The second half couldn't be played on any of my dvd players including those on my computers.Lesson learned: don't buy used dvds."
2,Clint Eastwood as Batman,"Heath Ledger was great, no doubt, but the guy doing batman (as clint eastwood) just sounded silly ...And since it was a ""batman"" movie, the whole idea was silly.Blame my wife for this review ... she put a gun to my head and made me watch it (and ordered it under my name from amazon so tough bologna)."
2,I would play a gambit with that *knight*,"The film, which is somehow hailed by the majority of critics, is a humorless, gruesome mess, which is painful to watch. It is brimming with pseudo-artistry of tricks and callow gadgetry. This is the problem with our Hyper-real reality - each new installation will be a copy of a copy - the further plagiarized original. Where is the humor of the original *Batman* (1989)? Where is the chemistry between Kim Basinger and Michael Keaton, the authenticity of Alfred?Where, I ask you, is Jack Nicholson's perfect gravitas and Joker's playful script conceived and executed with such agile perfection? Where is the artistic imagery of Gotham and subtle quality of the tracking shots and music score? Compared to the original *Batman*, this is a blotted unimaginative mess, guaranteed to cause a mild indigestion because of its unripe ideas and the glorified violence, which the film itself was supposed to scrutinize."
1,Insomniacs of the world unite!,"If you suffer from insomnia - this might work for you. Complicated (needlessly for a comic book story). Desperately seeking meaning in a tired old franchise. Of course I have great respect for Chris Nolan, but this movie sucks. I never was a Heath Ledger fan, but his is a good performance and thus a silver lining in this cloud of a film. Way too long (are there no editors in Hollywood anymore?). I don't want to have to sit and concentrate over a Batman film. Boo!"
1,Format Fail,"In addition to having a superfluous disk of stock footage of nobodies talking about nothing, this blu-ray suffers from format failure. I'm surprised I hadn't seen any comments about it. Nearly every other scene switches between widescreen and letterbox. This lack of continuity is unacceptable."
1,What a bad joke.,"One would expect something better from this movie. After all, the cast is impressive and other episodes have done fairly well. Yet, the movie and its actors manage to be bad where there was no room to fail. If you still want to see it, rent it: it would be cheaper and the disappointment bearable."
3,WAY OVERATED!,"Not going to say that the movie wasn't any good, it was very entertaining( a little too long though ). Seriously come on people this movie is only breaking records at the box office do to the death and performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger did an amazing job. He completely stole the show. Christian Bale was good when he was Bruce Wayne but when he put on the silly costume and became the Batman things got a little retarded. Like his voice for example. Another complaint that I have is everyone out there comparing this movie to Iron Man. Iron Man was also a very entertaining movie with flaws. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges they are both two totally different types of films. So jump off of the high horse and realize that Heath Ledger is the main reason that The Dark Knight will smash box office records."
4,Most Overrated Movie EVER!,"Still good, but extremely overrated. If Heath Ledger would have not died, this movie would not have done as good. And Christian Bale is still a crappy batman with a horrible voice. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart was a good two-face tho. Which surprised me."
2,Explosive.,"I guess I was looking for a little bit more. I was led to believe that, at some point in the 3 hours, Batman and The Joker would have a brief but interesting exchange about being two sides of the same coin--the nature of good and evil thing. I think they tried to work this in but, since The Joker is a lunatic, he couldn't make the case, ""You're just like me"". (See the movie Heat, where arch-villain DeNiro has coffee with good-guy cop Pacino, and the idea is, they're both professionals who shoot people...very interesting).Ok, so nothing that ""deep"". But I don't argue that the explosions were bigger; the sense of hopelessness, greater. Just what we need right now."
1,Very dissappointed,"I purchased this product - It was not clear to me from the description but, you can't view it with dvd player you have to have blue ray - It is useless to me I do not have a blue ray player - Now it is just junk!!"
1,"If you love this film, your standards are very low","All of Nolan's previous films are tangled messes (Memento, Insomnia, Inception). In seeking to create a slightly coherent film he has ruined all of the quirkiness and fantastically weird unorthodoxy of what has made Batman a loved and unique character in print and on screen. The irony is that if Nolan had used his prior directorial and writing techniques in creating this trio of Batman films, they would have been much more aesthetically and intellectually captivating: simply, better.The best part of this film was the few seconds long scene when The Joker sticks his head out of the police car window. For that scene, and for that scene only, this film gets one star."
5,BEST MOVIE OF 2008!!!,This is a must own Bluray! I saw this movie on my Honeymoon in Hawaii and another two times when I got back home. Easily will be best Batman movie in years to come! OWN IT! Dec 9th!
2,Completely Disappointed!,"This was not a Batman movie in my book. The special effects and overall look of the film was fantastic!! BUT, what the heck was all that violence, shooting, and killing??!! This is not what a super hero movie is supposed to be! Plus I don't know how many times I was completely lost in the story. It seems like a lot of recent movies are just filled with violence, a jumbled up story, but great special effects, and that gives these films 4 and 5 stars?! Not in my book, just take a look back on the earlier super hero movies."
2,Not as good as the Burton Batmans,"While the ""becoming Batman"" parts of ""Batman Begins"" were a welcome addition to the Batman canon, this one pales in comparison to the Tim Burton Batmans. Burton's had much more character development, and a lesser body count. The Burton ones cinematography and set were much more ""other worldly"" and interesting. While this one had better technology, the effects got to be headache-inducing in it's overlong 2 1/2 hours. I also prefer Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson to Bale/Ledger, and the Danny Elfman score for the Burton movies was preferable of course.While they are huge box office hits, I really wish Hollywood would stop regurgitating Batmans/Hulks/etc. with better effects but less nuance, and writing something original!"
5,Believe the hype :),Im not going to try to outdo the sea of reviews that precede me I will just simply say that this is an awesome movie that is worth every penny you spend on it.Even if you dont like or care about the Batman franchise you are still bound to like this action packed movie. From the plot to the action scenes this film is an all around package.
2,Disappointing lack of extras,"The film is photographed sublimely and Heath Ledger's performance is great but I'm disappointed in the lack of extras. There is not a single commentary track and only limited behind the scenes footage and information. There are two 45 minute worthless documentaries on Batman's technology and psychology which play like promo pieces rather than substantial extras, and then there are some pop up 'making of' extras that you can activate to watch during the film or separately. But each clip is only a few minutes so there is actually very little 'making of' or behind the scenes features at all."
5,A Performance That Inspired Me...,"All I have to say is this; after seeing Heath Ledger's portrayl of The Joker, I left the theatre realising that is the kind of character I'm going to be..."
5,The best Batman movie made thus far,Ingenious. Exhilarating. Nolan's use of the death-and-rebirth motif is incredible. The Joker may be the best on-screen villain of all time.
3,Very disappointing as a special edition,"The movie is great! but the features sucks! If you wanna buy cause of the movie go for it, but if you are a feature fun, then don't waste your $$$, we should wait till they come out with a better version and show more on how the made the movie etc."
5,Even better than Batman Begins,"I thought it would be hard for them to trump Batman Begins, but this far exceeds it with great performances from everyone."
5,Batman the Dark Knight,This is the first of many Bale will star in and we hope it will be for along time of Batman Movies.
4,Excellent -destined to be a classic.,"The blue-ray makes this movie shine, but it would anyway even as a regular DVD. Very re-watchable, so this is one of the few movies I've purchased in blu-ray. I'm more cautious now of buying a big library collection (like in the old days of VHS) and then getting obsoleted. ALSO-I would caution buyers to read carefully what the ""+BD Live"" means. I skimmed reading that part too much thinking it was some downloadable digital copy along with the physical blu-ray disk - that's not the case. It's a feature that you can turn on when you insert the disk to play, with the right player (WiFi blah blah). If your looking for the physical blu-ray and a bonus digital copy to have on your devices look elsewhere and read the whole description."
4,Really great movie,Something different and with more of a back story. I understand this is the first one but it did drag for me in the beginning.
5,Wonderful CD,Fast service and great music from the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago! I would highly recommend this supplier for future CD's! I rate them 4 stars!
5,Works great,"This is the ideal way to make hooking up your towed vehicle a snap. I use it on a class A motorhome towing a Jeep Wrangler. The coiled cord keeps everything neat and the included ""sockets"" keep the contacts nice and clean, protected from the weather. Since the cable provides 6-wires there are extra wires for other purposes such as the towed vehicle brakes and whatever else you might need. This beats the strand of wire wrapped in electical tape that I have been using! My wife says the blue coiled cord looks nice..."
5,Better than Zeppelin,"Although never given their props, GFR in the beginning was better than Led Zeppelin. This especially carried through the release of their second album (The RED album)which I consider their best. They were a great band until they turned to the commercial side of things turning out 45 style singles. And today, as it's been over the last 20 years, the only thing you ever hear on the radio is ""Loco-motion"" and ""We're An American Band"". Great songs, but not the original sound. This album is as raw as it gets and can truly be called ""Hard Rock"". WHY ISN'T THIS BAND IN THE ROCK 'N ROLL HALL OF FAME, but the O'Jays are?"
4,Strong Debut!,"Just a great, bluesy, guitar driven rock n' roll album, and it makes for an impressive debut from Grand Funk Railroad.But, of course, the bluesy rock album has been done a thousand times, so it's not just those elements that make it successful. Grand Funk also include some funk (obviously), folk, and progressive elements in their music, and it makes for a wonderful mix."
4,cool blus rock Album,"cool blus rock Album from 1969.""heart breaker"" is one of their hits that includ on this album.i need to write 20 words for this review so i got to say somthing haaaaaanyway, if i'll have to write 20 words every time they ask for review i guess its my last time :-)take care"
4,freshman effort shows what came next,"Their freshman effort is pretty cool, but listen to T.N.U.C. (spell it backwards) & Into the Sun, on the first live LP...much more exciting!"
3,no improvement,this product is not what I am looking for. It did not improve my skin. I will not buy it again.
1,disappointed,"Having spent some time in Germany and being familiar with Merkur products, I was very much disappointed with the quality of this razor. Not only did it have a flaw in the handle, the weight is definitely too light. It's more like a womens razor than a mens. Both in size and weight it is too small. I had one for years that finally gave out and expected a similar product. Surely someone makes a decent twin-trac razor. Returned to Sesto Senso and refunded without problem. Amazon.com informed me they would step up if need be."
5,"Bowser's Eggplant Dog Bed 44""","My 80lb Rhodesian/Lab mix has gone through 3 or 4 different dog beds and we've liked each of them, but we LOVE this one! It's so soft & plush and we've had it for over 9 months now and it's tough & still looks brand new. My dog has torn every other bed or it's flattened out, but this one is holding up great!"
2,a waste of ten bucks,"Rick Steves mask doesn't do much to keep light out from below.The curved bit around the nose is uncomfortable.The adjustable velcro strap is way too short, like it was made for children."
3,comfortable,I bought this sleep mask 4 years ago for a school trip to South America. Was able to wear the sleep mask comfortably while traveling. I like the raised eyes and nose. As long as I wear it low it keeps all the light out. I have worn it occasionally throughout the years and it is now starting to fall apart a little bit.
2,Was not the song I was looking for Disapointed !,"Was looking for her one strong Instramental !""Beauty""Was not on this sound track.Have not enjoyed this.music to repetative.Boring.Thank You !!"
5,Don't skip it,"This album contains some of my most favorite Caparezza songs. For me there were some instant loves and others that took a few listens before I truly appreciated them and came to love them. The instant loves were Torna catalessi, Dalla parte del toro, La mia parte intollerante and The Auditels family. The ones that took a while were Annunciatemi al pubblico, Gli insetti del podere, Ninna nanna di mazzaro', Il silenzio dei colpevoli, Inno verdano, Titoli, Felici ma trimoni and Sono troppo stitico.I liked this album enough that I bought it twice. The first time I bought it used. I later felt guilty because I enjoyed it so much so I purchased it new as well. If you like any of Caparezza's music it's worth owning! Don't judge it by the first few listens. Give it a chance."
2,Too few good songs,"Although I don't know a word of Italian, I was immediately intrigued with Caparezza when I first heard ""Torna Catalessi"". Fun, quirky rap that doesn't go into the realm of ""hey look at me I'm white and rapping ho ho that's so funny and original!"" It is a genuinely catchy song.Unfortunately I can not say the same for the rest of the CD. Many of his sound samples become quite annoying, and some of his songs seem too mediocre compared to the fun and upbeat ""Torna Catalessi"".Perhaps the only other good song on here is ""Felici Ma Trimoni"". Other than that this CD was a huge disappointment. Save your money."
1,"Good Movie, Defective Discs","I really was looking forward to getting this on DVD. Janet Margolin is enchanting here. But after two defective discs, I gave up. The discs showed ""empty"" of content. Amazon was great about the returns, but I really didn't want to go through it a third time. Apparently these are ""burned to order"" by Amazon. They need to check the quality of the blanks they're buying or their own equipment or processes. Hope to find a used one sometime, I guess."
4,Ventage Gene Roddenberry move,"I you like Star Trek and other Gene movies, this is a must have rare movie. With the purchase of this movie, this now completes my library of all the Roddenberry movies."
2,very stupid movie,This was the most boring 90 minutes I have ever spent watching a movie. This movie is a vehicle for John Saxon to show every bulge and cranny on his body with this incredibly tight body suit.Even the part where the women are rubbing Saxon's chest you can fully see his woody growing on camera.What a loser this film is.
2,Future eventual freedom fighter.,This DVD based 1970's TV movie seem plausible and the man named Dylan Hunt who seek freedom from enslaved men in female dominated community from female controllers.
3,Just Do It: A Little One-Sided,"While I found Just Do It an interesting, well-written book, the book was obviously partial to Nike and Phil Knight. After reading this book, I was unsure if I could take the Nike Company at face value. Katz glosses over the issue of Nike's sweatshops, a topic which I was very interested in, and hoped to learn more about through this book. Nike is known for its powerful advertising, and Just Do It gave me many insights to the great extent that Nike goes to in making the perfect commercial."
4,Star-studded,"Liberally drawing examples from interviews with well-known athletes, Katz paints a picture of Nike as a company that makes great shoes, knows how to negotiate, and created the idea of the athlete as a brand. He shows the power Nike has in creating an image of an athlete, and fitting that image into a Nike ad campaign. The athlete gets more of a newly-identifyable image than Nike. I'm not a big sports fan, and I don't know if I've ever worn Nikes, but I was found this book to be a good read from a business and marketing perspective - as well as to hear about some big-name athletes."
4,A Balanced Review of a Pioneering Company,"This is probably the fairest look at Nike you will find. Far from being a mere tribute to the company, ""Just Do It"" looks at Nike's triumphs and failures. Excellent insight into the business strategy and the creation and maintenance of ""the Nike image"". It's nice to read something unbiased after all the Nike-bashing that has gone on in the media. This book makes a great companion to ""Swoosh"" which is the actual history of the company. I read them back to back (Swoosh first) and it was great."
4,It's kinda hot,"This book was kinda hot. I liked how it stayed on point, unlkike other books. It inticed me to keep on reading. THe book was very inciteful on the corporate world and how Nike is runned. I especially liked how there were a lot of examples and pass references of Michael Jordan and he was ""Nike""."
2,ECONIMICS CLASS,"FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE KIND OF BORING, BEFORE READING THIS BOOK ITHOUGHT THAT KATZ WOULD TELL THE READERS MORE OF THEBEGINNING OF THE NIKE COMPANY. I WOULD OF HAD A BETTERUNDERSTANDING IF I WOULD OF SEARCH ON THE INTERNET THANACTUALLY READING THE BOOK. IT KEPT ON TELLING HOW MICHAELJORDAN-NIKE RELATIONSHIP. BUT IT DID NOT MENTION ANYTHING THATGRABBED MY ATTENTION, ONLY WHEN THEY MENTION THE CONDITIONWERE THE WORKERS WORK AT, THE SWEATSHOP!!!!"
1,Just do ti: the Nike spirit in the corporate world,"The book had some intresting facts, but it was just too boring. The book kept on explaining the same things over and over again. At the same time though I learned some new things."
2,not her best,"I agree this is one of her worst books, but I love most of her older books and am looking forward to future books. Opening chapter was boring and unrealistic. She should have her fans input on her books before they are published , if she had done that on this book she would have found out it wasn't up to scratch."
1,Thinly veiled porn!,"This is trash in it's purest form. The hero and heroine have no depth and their story, if you can call it that, is lust, sex and gratification. No thanks!"
1,Has Susan Johnson forgotten how to write a good story?,"The story is a mess and there is no good characterisation of Trixi and Pasha at all! I miss the old Susan Johnson who wrote keepers like ""Outlaw"" and ""Sinful""."
3,Definitely not Susan Johnson's best,"I have been a Susan Johnson fan for several years. Her stories of the Lakota Indian family (I forgot the name, but Blaze is the mother) were wonderful. Her stories are always hot and sexy with real relationships between passionate people who are not afraid to express their love for each other. While this book had her trademarks, it seemed very contrived with her trying too hard to put the hero and heroine into situations that you knew were made up just to be made up.I love her still, however, and hope she recaptures the spirit of Blaze's family in her future books.I hate to critique, however, because if I could write I'd be doing it."
2,"Yes, i agree!","This book was definitely not Susan Johnson's best. It is the second one that I have read and it most certainly pales in comparison to the first book I read by her ""Golden Paradise"". Of all the reviews that I have read, no one seems to have mentioned this particular book, and I wonder why. It is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is full of intrigue, passion and love between Stephan and Lisaveta. I recommend that fans of Susan Johnson read ""Golden Paradise"" instead of this one."
5,"Trixi and Pasha ARE Passion,Adventure and Hypnotic!!!","Just finished reading A TOUCH OF SIN!!! This is Susan Johnson's most erotic book to date. LOVE STORM and TABOO come close BUT this particular book wins hands down.The Characters are larger than life and the story is better than a 5 night miniseries.There is plenty of lust,greed,destruction,sex,love,passion,more sex, and finally a simple happy ending.However, I should warn the book does contain some rough language and the words used between the hero and the heroine while they make love may not be for the faint of heart.That said I enjoyed it tremendously!!!"
4,Theory of Forms is outstanding!,"This album is outstanding. Very good jazz rock. Sadler creates beautiful and disturbing musical images. Not to mention, Mike Keneally and Bryan Beller are forces to be reckoned with. Very good record."
3,Fun with the Gals,"These women know their swing. From rocking originals like ""Salvatore"" to reinterpreted traditionals like ""Frailoch,"" this album satisfies the need within all of us for reedy rhythms. Amy Denio is an extremely talented musician AND an exceptional bandleader, and it shows. The players have obviously spent many hours practicing together, and each song is richer for the effort. Music like this, played only for the sheer love of playing, is as good as it gets."
3,"Strong, fun compositions","Four saxophones and occasional drums yield a good mix of soundplay. Traditional songs like ""Frailoch,"" innovative compositions like ""I Will Be Sad,"" and thoughtful pieces like ""Bus Horn Concerto"" are rich and stand up well to repeat listenings. Unfortunately, the recording is just muddy enough to keep this from getting a fourth star.Fans of Amy Denio shouldn't pass this up - even if her tremendous vocal talents aren't showcased, her compostion and instrumental accomplishment shine."
3,"light weight, easy to store, too short, rust","I have one of these jacks supporting the rear of my trailer in the driveway, it is rock steady even with four people in the trailer. I like it that these are light weight (steel jack stands can be quite heavy) and I like that these come apart easily and stack up into a compact set for storage.As far as using these for camping: hmmm. They are really too short for my camper, so I'll need to haul 2x6 pieces around to raise them up. Also, the head (the piece that touches the frame of the trailer) doesn't swivel well under load and can pop off of the frame while you are raising the stand. And the steel parts (the nut and the screw) aren't galvanized so they rust."
4,"Good Jacks, poor packaging","Primarily: They do what they are supposed to for my 30 ft. trailer. Work well and easy.Secondarily: They came shipped in their own box, which is weak enough to need an outer box - arrived in pieces, but all metal held up, though scratched. Needed to be a little less green to package the weight of 4 metal stands."
4,Sturdy little stands,"These stands are nice, light and very sturdy. I use them for my camper and they have plenty of height and easy to adjust. The only thing that keeps them from being five stars is the top pad can be bent easily if you do not position them squarely (which was really my fault). Good little stands for what they are designed for."
4,As advertised.,"It arrived in a timely manner and is exactly the product that is advertised. It is fairly durable and feels reasonably solid. The only knock against them I have is that under pressure the plates attached to the top of the bolts grip and cause the top to shift to potentially unstable positions. But as it says on the packaging, these are meant as stands, not jacks."
4,Great Movie,"I thought this was a great movie. I loved the actor playing Gino. I actually felt like he was ment for the part. Although the books were much better, I really enjoyed this movie and the sequal to it. Sandra Bullock was a good Maria, but her part was too short.The actress playing Lucky was brilliant! She gave off the real essence of Lucky."
3,Lucky Chance that the movie aired!!,"The movie could have been better if they left out Nicolette's horrific so called acting. all the other actors did their characters justice! The make-up in first 12yrs for the female actress for the story line was gruesom, but it did get better!! All in all the movie was fine I would recommend buying this movie @ a discount only!!"
4,loved the soap stars,"What a cast. But first of all Jackie writes great books. now Nicollette, Desperate Housewives, Vincent< David on AMC, yah, Eric Victor on Y&R, Phil Morris, good soap person. First I bought this movie because Vincent & Eric were in it. Second because Jackie wrote it. Now I know the movie is never as good as the book, that is a given, but I knew this cast would bring it through. thank you cast. I miss you Vincent."
4,Tom and Jerry are the best!,"My boys, 4 & 5, are wild for Tom and Jerry, and this DVD is one of their favorites. Good price and lots of laughs."
2,Not a Good Introduction to Syntax,"This was a very disappointing book. It was used as a textbook for an undergraduate Syntactic Theory course that I took, and I just did not find it to be very understandable. There weren't enough examples of structure, and the examples that were there were often not adequately explained. Theories were not clearly distinguished, and several theories were presented at once, making it difficult to tell them apart. Some of the material was very good, especially the parts on phrase structure rules and syntactic categories. Everything after chapter 5, however, made little sense and was just too thick and murky to wade through. The sections on anaphora, passives, raising, and control were very difficult to understand. Keep in mind that this is coming from a beginner's perspective, and perhaps people with more of a background in syntax will have a much better time with it. However, as an introduction to syntactic theories and concepts it was not a very helpful book."
1,where is the cd?,The book is fine but for all people buying this book used for school be aware that it may not come with the CDs. please check on this before purchase.
5,I give this 5 stars!,"This CD is full of emotion and for any horse owner or lover, it would truly be a gift to receive! I play it in the barn for my horses and they winny to it!"
5,Horses of the Wind,"This is one of the most beautiful albums I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. If you love music and horses, this is a unique and beautiful combination of both. It tells the story of horses, their lives and loves and you can imagine their movements and images as you listen to the beautiful arrangements. I am so glad I have had this experience. Thank you, Robert Vavra!!!"
4,Horses of the Wind CD,If you love horses you will love this CD with the added sounds of real horses. Music is relaxing and up-lifting.
3,Romantic suspense in a small Colorado mountain town.,"This is a good book for younger female audiences (10-17). The characters appeal to the reader and the descriptions are superb. The reader gets a real sense of who these people are and what summer in Silverton, Colorado, is like. I empathized with Lissa and her desire to make a life away from her aunt, who has managed her life since she was orphaned.. John is the typical ""rescuer"" but we cheer him on in his escape from his devious ex-wife, who plots to remove Lissa from his life forever."
5,Functional and well made,Bought this product for Christmas and have used it about 6-8 times so far. The variable speeds and turbo function are nice features. The chopping blade works well and doesn't turn things to mush as long as you don't over do it.Made whipped cream with the whisk and that was fast and easy - be careful to not lift the whisk as it will send your liquid all over the area.Tried to make a smoothie with the hand blender and it came out OK but not all the frozen fruit got blended. Suggest letting the fruit either thaw a bit or use the chopper blade and container as that worked well.Clean-up is simple and this unit has plenty of power. Will consider purchasing a smaller chopper container and blade for when you only need a small amount of something. It can be a tad tiresome holding the power button but that's not a major inconvenience.Would definitely recommend.
5,The best little tool in the kitchen!,What an awsome hand blender! I've had mine for a year and never a problem. So cool how all the parts snap off and on. Made my favorite fudge recipe-Blended the boiling sugar and evaporated milk to the creamiest consistency ever without melting the base of the blender. The turbo makes sauces and soups a breeze. Wouldn't be without it.
2,Over priced,This product although it performs well is not worth the money. Its older version at70.00 some dollars performs every bit as good. at that price you might as well buy a proffesional immersion blender with three times the powe.r and performance.
4,Very happy with my new Braun Multiquick Handblender.,"Great little quick blender. Only problem with it has been the bottom piece of the bowl will not stay attached to the bowl. It is the part that keeps it steady as you blend. It is supposed to snap in place but does not do so very well. Also, the wall hanger is a piece of junk. But the blender itself is GREAT!"
5,Best hand blender!,I love this powerful hand blender. It will puree soups in zero time. Great features include easy cleanup in the dishwasher and the traditional blender attachment. I researched many different brands until I settled on the Braun for one major reason: the design of the blade housing. Many brands have small holes around the blade housing to allow liquids to flow through while blending. My previous hand blender had these and they would CLOG every time I used them to blend something fibrous (like butternut squash). I always had to clean out the holes mid-use. The Braun has a nice fluid design that does not clog!
1,Loved it until the motor gave up,"I owned this little blender for 8 months and LOVED it, until I mashed cooked potatoes today and the motor blew out of the blue. There was no warning of overheating, straining on the motor etc. just a plop sound and the thing is broken. After having it loved for 8 months I am hugely disappointed and would not buy it again"
3,Braun MR 5550 M BC-HC hand blender type 4191 (Jan 2004),"I've had it for years ($138 CAD in January 2004) and have been using it far more often than my kitchenaid heavy duty mixer and my other Braun combimax 650 food processor. I've had to replace the motor part and enjoy using all the attachments, except for the whisk, simply because it's not really dishwasher friendly as advertised - while clean and dry, it will leak when mixing the food, a dark brown liquid - could be rust or oil. I dunno if this is a design flaw that is fixed with current models or I simply need to send it for repair - but why did it start leaking in the first place? Is it really dishwasher safe? I just know it's not pleasant to have suspicious brown liquid drip into your fluffy white whipped cream! Ugh!"
2,Motor gave out - disappointed,"We bought this product 3 years ago, and the warranty with Braun is just for 1 year. I used it pretty regularly and it was very efficient and useful. However, I am really disappointed that it broke after just 3 years. I called Braun and they said that I could take it to the local service center but would have to pay to get it fixed. Most blenders last at least 5 years before dying. Next time, I'm going to get a different brand and hopefully something that lasts longer."
5,I love this hand blender,"I have had this hand blender for about 10 years. I love it. Not sure why Braun doesn't seem offer this full setup in the US any more. I just recently had to replace the smaller jar, and was thrilled to be able to find it. This tool has replaced my blender, and I use the small jar all the time to chop herbs, garlic and spice. The shaft is a great length for pots of soup, and everything but the motor can be tossed right into the dishwasher. This is a keeper. (well, I guess I will admit I haven't had much use for the whisk attachment...)"
3,Darkest jazz guitar tone!,His tone is so dark is hard to follow. Interesting but somehow i always end up listeniing and paying more attention to what Swallow and Favre are doing than what O'leary is. Not really my cup of tea....you really have to dig his rythm and tone to get into his vibe. Compositions did not stand out as much either. Nice but was expecting more specialy when in the company of such heavy weights.
4,Good for entry-level and webpage editing,"...As long as you take pictures with good light you'll be fine. The flash can burn your closeups, though, and the shutter speed is so-so - forget about quick motion pictures! Also, the controls are difficult to use. With so many limitations, why four stars? Well, if the subject doesn't move and/or there's good light the quality is quite good. The USB port is great (try the serial one and you'll understand while you wait), and the TV output is convenient. All cables are included, even a power supply, and the software is good. Be careful with two things, though: don't use the diskettes included, one has the driver (an updated version is available at RCA's website) and the other one has a Windows dialup update (it wreaked havoc with my dialup windows). All in all, a great way to get started and quite enough for your website (remember, high resolution pictures take time to download)."
2,You get what you pay for,"If all you want to do is take a picture of yourself or your car etc. to put up on a webpage, this will work.but you wont get especially sharp pictures. The resolution is 640x480, but its a fairly fuzzy 640x480. If you can cough up more money, you probably should. Remember youll never have to pay for developing your pictures :)"
1,Much too hard to use,"I know how to program a VCR, program in Visual Basic, manage a web site and have an extra class ham radio licence. But I couldn't figure out how to manage this little camera so am returning it. I'm glad the other reviewer like it, but I can't deal with it."
1,not mac friendly,"It says mac compatible. It did not have mac driver in the box and directed me to their website to download it which wasn't convenient for that computer. Then I found I still could not get the camera to work with the computer. By that time, it was too late to return it. Uhh! The only thing I could do with it, was to display a picture briefly on the television."
5,Great book .... highly recommend,"I was stunned to see everything I was doing wrong as a parent. This book has put a new perspective on how I communicate to my child more effectively and set a better example as a parent. I highly recommend it, I wish I had read it earlier during my child's toddler years."
1,very old-fashioned,"you can really tell this book is from the seventies or sixties or whatever. its been a while since ive started reading it, therefore i dont remember exact phrases, but it has advice on not saying this or that to your child, and the examples are pretty extreme insults, something no one would say to their kids nowadays anyway. its like saying dont hit your children, when no one in their right minds does that anyway. it might have been new and valuable information 35 years ago, but its not anymore today."
2,Some good info but light on correction,"I thought there was some good information but I think it was light on correction. While I believe that we need to create a loving, safe, and encouraging environment for our children I also believe that there are times when children defy authority and need to be corrected. This book tries to combat the problem before it happens by the way we communicate with them. Although communication is key to the Parent/child relationship, children need to know that the Parent is in charge, that they must obey the first time and without argument. Don't get me wrong, children are a beautiful blessing from God and they need to be nurtured so carefully. But along with that nurturing comes this demand for obedience because I am their authority. The book was light on parental authority and presented parents merely as guides in a child's life rather than an authority to be obeyed and to protect them. I think our society could use a bit more respect for authority."
5,the best in positive education,"This is THE best book I've read on education and I've read many. It's about respectful education: being able to listen and react positively to children instead of agressing them which is how most parents pretend to educate their children.Ginott is a genius, he wrote this in the 70's and it is still valuable today. This book changed my view on education and left me totally unsatisfied with traditional rearing. I read a lot of books which clearly inherited from these views and I've changed my way of rearing my child. My husband and I chose a respectful non-violent form of education and never had to regret it since.The book is great, everything in it is clear and valuable. No parent should be without this. I wish it were easier to find in French for all the parents in my country!!!"
5,"Stellar advice, True Wisdom, Irreplaceable","I can't say enough about how valuable this book is. If I could meet the author myself to get down on my knees and thank him, I would. He has given such wise advice about the importance of caring about children's feelings. He has taught me more effectively than anyone else in my life what it really means to respect other people. I try to keep his principles in mind every day when raising my three children, ages six, four and sixteen months. Demonstrating the fact that I care about their feelings has helped me tremendously in disciplining them. They are well-behaved and happy children (most of the time!) Excellent, superb. The wisdom is sound and deserves much more than a quick glance. The more time you invest in internalizing the principles, the more you will get out of it. I am forever indebted to Dr. Ginott!!"
5,"Designing Outdoor Environments for Children: Landscaping School Yards, Gardens and Playgrounds","I absolutely love this book, it is filled with beautiful examples of unique spaces that you can make to engage and educate children about nature."
5,This book is charming!,I'm disappointed that this book is out of print. Some friends have heard excerpts from my copy and want to purchase a copy for themselves. Three years ago I gave copies of it as a Christmas gift. I hope the publisher will decide to start printing this again! This book shows that it's okay to be a Christian and have a sense of humor at the same time.
2,POOR EXCUSE FOR A TRUNK,"First off, Grand Funk is my all time favorite US garage band, if not US band period. I was stoked to hear of the COMPLETE Capitol catolog re-release's. Secondly, I am happy with the CD's themselves, although I thought the idea of buying the trunk (Box set)was to get ALL of the CD's at once. My first dissappointment however was the lack of thought (coolness!) and 5 cent budget put into the trunk (cardboard box covered with colored paper & filled with 2 measly little useless trinkets in a special smaller box.) Remember the age group this band came from! If you are short of money, then I suggest ""Thirty Years of Funk"" box set, as a much better value. My second & biggest dissappointment is that no where in the 12 album (CD) reissue is the number one album of all time! Mark, Don & Mel 1969-1971 ! This is the ONLY CD REISSUE most of us even want. I played this album, 8-track, & cassette to death. Fortunately I still have an LP to burn a CD from."
3,Good movie,"A very typical Bolly wood drama of the eighties. A loyal union leader is murdered and made it to look like an accident. His son grows up and takes revenge. This was Sanjay Dutts first movie and it shows... childish acting and dancing. However if does give the film a fresh feel. Its got all you can expect from a Hindi movie, songs dance, action, tragedy and of course a happy ending. Music is particularly melodious and RD Burman has done a great job at that. Amjad Khan does a positive role here. A must see for Sanjay Dutt fans and also for those who enjoy eighties Hindi cinema. Its fun to see Shakti Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt disco dancing."
5,Delighted to have read this novel,"66 Laps captures the emotions and conflicts of a 30-something new mother and wife. It's a terrific easy to read novel. Leslie's voice has depth and detail that present concise and carefully chosen descriptions, and insightful dialogue. She has crafted a stylized novel that subtilely mirrors the main characters, their lifestyles and their choices. The lead character, Audrey's, inner turmoil and fantastic imagination combine taking her on a journey of impulsive twists and turns to disasterous results that will forever change her reality. As breezy a read as it really is, the realities will keep you thinking about the novel for a long time. You should buy a copy and read it."
1,Couldn't put it down--like watching a train wreck,"Life is too short to spend time reading this book. After reading the author's non-fiction essay in the book ""Mommy Wars,"" I eagerly got this book, and I'm sorry to say I really, really hated it. It was startlingly dark and depressing, without any redeeming literary value. Throw this one back, quick!"
3,A little book of Pendulum Magic,I enjoyed this book and found it informative but if you are looking for more depth and a search for spiritual guidence then it lacks a little in this respect. Overall a informative journey.
4,KISS approach,Short and to the point - Keep It Short and Simple - nice little instructional (not theory) book on using a pendalum.
5,The Dark Side of Camelot,"This is one of the most interesting historical books that I have read in a long time. It certainly takes some of the glint & glitter off of JFK and creates some very interesting avenues on who it was that called for his assination. It should be a must read for, at least, every history major & minor and who ever is going to be teaching modern American history. It was a very hard book to put down."
3,Hersh jumped the gun.,"I just read this book, a little late I guess. Hersh should have waited a year or two to write this then he could have added a couple more chapters, in light of the many disclosures that have come out since then. I was always a strong Kennedy fan, but now I find that I am a disappointed Kennedy fan. In spite of the Cuban Crises I think JFK was probably an average President, not great, but also not poor. Hersh covers a lot of ground but seems to have completely missed the Mary Pinchot Meyer affair. Perhaps this was intentional for some reason, but he certainly failed to mention it while discussing all the other JFK women. (I guess Pinchott was of a higher class paramour than the others). Since Hersh wrote this book it seems the entire Kennedy clan has taken somewhat of a dive, but I guess that under today's ethics standards that's to be expected. We wouldn't expect books written by Salinger, O'Donnell, Fay, and in particular Schlesinger to be objective."
2,Worth passing up !!!,"I found the author repeating the same information over and over in different sections of the book. I'am more disappointed with myself for picking up the book than what the author wrote --- in another words, this is a good one to pass up."
1,What an Investigator!,Amazing! The Church Committee couldn't find the connection between illegal anti-Castro activities and JFK...and Richard Nixon couldn't find the connection. But Seymour Hersh found it! What total nonsense.
3,Noted,"An important corrective to brainless Kennedy worship but not in retrospect, worthy of its length. I mean so JFK banged alot of girls who had not said ""I do"" to him. But fun in a gossipy way. Plus of course the Kennedys were all crooks. According to this book!"
3,Interesting book that is stronger on reportage than analysis,"Mr. Hersh paints a convincing picture of JFK as an extremely hard working, ambitious man who was party to a myriad of addictions including painkillers and sex. I actually found the early sections of the book which deal primarily with his father Joe Kennedy to be insightful into the kind of environment he grew up in and undoubtably led to his immoral nature. Where Hersh is on weaker ground is when he tries to psychoanalyze JFK. He attempts to connect all of Kennedy's personal issues to decisions made about international politics, a hazardous course. I think Hersh was too close to Kennedy and his sense of profound disappointment as well as his breathy, rumormonger style of writing sometimes hurts his credibility which is unforunate because I think the author wrote a thought provoking, intelligent book"
2,Review for The Dark Side Of Camelot,"As I read this book I got the feeling that it was a tabloid at worst and simply petty at best. The author clearly has an agenda and is out to discredit the president. I am saying this with no attachment to either party or to JFK whatsoever. The book is basically about JFKs affairs, his supposed ties to the mafia, the botched Bay of Pigs invasion, and a few others. It's basically a tearing down of JFK and his public persona. I found it rather parochial frankly."
5,JFK makes Bill Clinton look like a pussy cat.,"It must be assumed that Hersh is as good an investigative reporter as his reputation indicates, and therefore the book must be very largely factual. It is hard to imagine that the occupant of Camelot (and his father and brothers) were actually the scoundrels so comptetely depicted. I, for one, have had my ""hero"" worship dashed to zero by the goings on in ""OUR"" White House. Hillery, take note!!"
5,an interesting way to review the history of the early 60's,"a lot has been written about the accuracy of hersh's assertions. i'll leave that for the historians to decide. what i found fascinating was what a fun and detailed read this was about the major events of the kennedy presidency. there are certainly better pure histories of the bay of pigs, the berlin wall, the 1960 election, the cuban missile crisis, etc. however, i am not sure that there is a more entertaining book encompassing all of these incidents.you have to remember that hersh has a strong point of view, and most of what he presents is geared at supporting that point of view. if you keep that in mind and take his conclusions with a grain of salt, the level of detail he provides makes for a very interesting historical read."
4,Fascinating Read...if a Bit Skewed,"Hersh does a commendable job with his research. He certainly doesn't lack for sources, and the evidence gathered DOES show that JFK and company acted questionably on any number of occasions. However, his treatment of Kennedy is a bit one-sided.I'm very much a ""Warts and All"" person when it comes to Presidential evaluations...and JFK obviously had more than his share of those. My problem with ""Dark Side of Camelot"" is that one may get the impression that Kennedy never did anything for reasons outside of personal gain, at ANY cost; that he and his administration were completely incompetent and unethical, and that whatever ""successes"" were achieved were done so through random ""dumb luck"".I've never subscribed to the ""Camelot"" view of the Kennedy Presidency. However, Hersh paints JFK, his family and administration as a mix of Stalin, Machiavelli and Caligula.Again, it was an excellent read...just a little too biased in my opinion."
5,"Pure Brilliant,","I have had the pleasure of reading this book and I love books on JFK, but this is truthfull and an exciting read, I hadn't long finished this book when I began it again."
1,Nice Chop Job,"My only question to Mr. Hersh is why has it taken 34 years for this stuff to come out. If these things really happened as Mr. Hersh and his so-called witnesses say they did, then it surely would have come out much sooner. It's really easy to kick a man that can't answer for himself."
3,The Dark Side of Camelot,"Interesting book, Seymour. Quick get onto the British royal family, they would love you to write '' The Dark Side of a Wayward Princess'' If you got the girls slavering over the Kennedys exploits , just imagine how the boys would love..... the dark side of Lady Di, go get 'em Seymour!!!.All in all an interesting book , but like an early reviewer I could not get Kitty Keller out of my mind. Still we have to keep an open mind about all politicians."
1,Prove it!,"It is a sad commentary that anyone can take a collection of unproven allegations and present it to the public like this without any evidence backing it, and some people still defend it by citing the book's own flawed and unsupported arguments.Two words; prove it.With all of the supposed orgies going on where are all the women who can now cash-in with their own stories? In a post-Clinton world what is to stop them, if it's true? 180 degrees from this piece of effluvia is The Kennedy Tapes, where they back up statements with transcripts from tapes made at the time. Yes, unlike the world that the tabloid historians live in, real historians have to (and do) back up their writing with research and documentation from credible sources. They prove it.This book isn't The Dark Side of Camelot, it's the Dark Side of Trash for Cash Journalism. I hope Mr. Hersh made enough money to justify the prostitution of his credibility."
3,hmm.....i already read the richard reeves book,"I actually didn't read the book but skimmed it at Borders because they have the most comfortable chairs to crash in. Haven't we heard enough about this guy. Geez. And brook@sofcom.net, whoever you are, get a grip. You're supposed to review the book not offer up another lame conspiracy theory. Go take your neglected wife to dinner and turn off the computer already."
1,This book is pure trash,The only reason I didn't give this a rating of 1 is because this guy may write another book. I hate to think that this trashy book cost the lives of perfectly good trees. The only value to be realized from this will come from the fact that it is biodegradable.
3,Dirt in detail,"Book seems very well researched, but can be a bit of a slog in places. Should have had a chapter on the martyr/myth process that evolved after Kennedy's assassination. What a mess."
4,One of the Better Books...,"This is definitely one of the better books written about the Kennedy administration.It is NOT an assasination conspiracy book. (Thats why I like it...).It's loaded with juicy nuggets on JFK's ""exploits""."
3,Hatchet job? Maybe...but it's true,"I found this book to be quite interesting regarding the facts of JFK's presidency...and his constant conspiring with RFK to get their way. I was quite familiar with most of what I read. I had heard about lots of this information on TV documentaries and other books about JFK. So, most of it didn't come as a surprise. It didn't come across to me as filth, but facts. And I'm quite sure most or all of it is true. Hersh was quite free in naming his sources. Worth a read and adding to your library if you are unfamiliar with the dark side of JFK. If you think JFK walks on water, don't read it. It will shatter your beliefs. I gave it three stars because of the familiarity of the material."
2,close but no cigar,"I used to think Seymour Hersh was a dedicated journalist but this book, although right on many parts about JFK and his father, seems as if it was written by an ex-lover of one of the Kenndey's who got screwed over. Granted Jack did put himself in danger by sleeping with a lot of women (which all of Washington knew) but he misses his character completely which somebody would with there simple-minded christian outlook on life. I would say 3/4ths of this book is right but this rest is fabrications and falsehoods propagated by Kennedy bashers (who exist to this day) but on many points he is dead wrong such as Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs, the mafia-CIA murder plots, and so on. If you want a one-sided book showing the dark side of Camelot than this is for you."
4,"JFK was a man, not a hero","This is a very readable, interesting book, that delves into the totality of JFK and his family. It's not a hatchet job, it's not unfair, and Hersh abstains from grandiloquent grandstanding. I think, personally, that Hersh is actually sympathetic towards JFK, whose life was a vicarious tool for his father, Joe Kennedy. Old Joe, if anyone, comes off the worst: a shrewd, ruthless, completely amoral snake of a man, who let absolutely nothing come between his dynastic designs and their ultimate fruition. Bobby Kennedy is depicted as a humorless square (who was, not surprisingly, handed the job of Attorney General--without ever having tried a case beforehand!), and Teddy--well, the less said about Teddy, the better. This book will reveal the reality as opposed to the utter myth of Camelot, and shed some light on America's most famous family of plutocrats."
3,Mr. Hersch tell us something we don't know!,"This book is basically a repeat and repeat and repeat of what we already know about John Kennedy. In every chapter are claims of President Kennedy's indiscretions, well we know that, did you just have to fill the pages, I was expecting some good journalism, not repeats.And what is with all those footnotes. Way too many."
3,GET REAL,"As if the first conspiracy were not enough more mediocre trash about JFK. So what's the point?Could it be people are finally finding out who really wanted JFK dead and why??? Kennedy not Johnson declared the WAR on poverty. Before he died he printed 5.5 BILLION in United States Notes to finance that WAR, not Vietnam mind you, but the War on poverty. United States Notes (Legal tender for all debts public and private) We are talking 5.5 Billion dollars in money without a Federal reserve stamp. 5.5 Billion dollars that every Bank in the Country was going to have to make change for and deal with day in and day out and not be able to charge a dimes worth of interest on because it was not FEDERAL RESEVRE MONEY!!! ??? What could be worse??? The guy couldn't keep his U NO WHAT in his pants. But he never did near the damage that the fascist's that murdered him have>"
4,History repeating itself....especially now!,"I was in the 7th grade when JFK was assassinated. My grandfather saw it happen. Like other Americans who were young and impressionable, I loved the Kennedys and bought into the Camelot myth.Now, we find that even Camelot had its warts and secret hiding places. I'm sorry to learn about the President's dallying and maneuverings, but I am not surprised. It was all too good to be true.This is the first comprehensive book I've read on the cracks in Camelot's facade. It seems to me that Mr. Hersh has done his homework. I read the entire book. I didn't like the facts that were presented, but I believe Hersh did a thorough job researching his subject matter.Now, our current President faces charges that would have most probably been levelled at JFK had he lived. Maybe Hersh is already at work on ""InternGate.""I guess it's true that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac."
4,Suprisingly well done.,"Given that this was most likely written to cash in on the recent increase of Ozzy's mainstream profile, the book is much better than one might expect. It provides an entertaining, engaging look at Ozzy's life. Fans of Black Sabbath and Ozzy's solo efforts beware, however -- there is little or no discussion of Ozzy's bandmates and sidemen, or the music they created."
1,Cheap garbage,"These things work okay for a while but then the plastic hose that goes from the pump to the wand will get brittle and it will just break. Then you will have to throw the unit out and buy another one because they design it so you can't fix or replace the hose, so plan on buying a new one every year or two. The quality of this product is extremely poor. Another good example of the garbage coming out of China."
2,Not a quality item,"I've had two Waterpiks in the last year. The first one broke after 6 months. This one the water line is so coiled, you can't close the lid without problems with jamming. Other Waterpik tips are not interchangeable."
5,Water Pik wp 65 Dental Water Jet,The product was great and fast service . I planning order again.Doug C
1,"Do not waste your money, Waterpik is finished","I bought the the Wp-65 model , after 1 week the pump would not work. returned it to the store for a second one but it had no water pressure after 4 days. this marks a 100% failer rate. maybe the older waterpiks work but not the newer ones, Waterpik has really lowered its standards. If they keep going the way they are the company will probably fold in 9 months. the concept is good but they have to make a machine that actually works and without the jackhammer noise that shakes the whole house. I will be looking for a competers brand."
3,Uncomfortable,"This is our second such device; the first one served us well for more than ten years. This replacement has a stiffer, less pliant hose. The motor seems to be stronger, pushing out a more vibrant and thinner stream of water, which, when inadvertently aimed at soft skin tissue, under the tongue for example, causes a degree of pain. The nozzle is located under the blue plastic container of water and we find it awkward to remove. The water tank is easy to use; we normally put in two small glasses of water and when we are done, we let the hose drop into the sink and the water left in the container drains out into the sink. We find that we are making less use of this model than we did of the previous one."
2,Too much noise,It works good but this is a very noisy equipment.It bothers family while using. This is why I didn't like the product
1,Should last longer,I have had this unit less than a year. It has been leaking for quite some time and now I can't adjust the water pressure. It is stuck at too low a setting so it is now useless. These things should last longer. I see many other reviewers had the same problem. Junk.
4,Good product.,Pleased with the product. It does the job as expected of it. What else do you expect me to say.
3,"Happy, but could be better","I'm happy with this purchase, but would like a *much* longer & more flexible tube from the base unit to the part that you hold, even if I had to purchase it separately. Also I would prefer the jet to be a bit more powerful."
5,In Addition to Burshing your teeth,"This is my third ""WaterPik"" in 20+ years. And I still have my original teeth at almost 65 years of age."
1,watepik good but this model sucks,"I owned another waterpik for a few years that broke recently and replaced it with this one because i loved the old one so much. Unfortunately the button that pauses the water from spraying requires you to push down really hard or the water will still run.my fingers start to ache after a few seconds of using this. So unless you have a strong grip with your thumb and wont mind a big dent in your finger, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise stay away from this model at least."
1,piece of garbage,Bought this less than 30 days ago. I have been having trouble for a few days but tonight it won't even pump water. I'm exchanging it in hopes it was a fluke. If not...I'll return for full refund. Thank goodness Amazon has a great return policy.
4,Not as powerful,"I have used waterpiks for a long time and this was a replacement for my old one that wore out. The only thing that bothers me about it is that it is not as powerful as the old one I had. It is still a good product, but I wish it had a stronger setting."
2,Great when it works,My WaterPik was great -- I did not mind the noise and found that I ould contol the twisted coil hose by putting it in a cup between brushes. But the thing quit--just quit. What in the world is going on? Is there any recourse for inferior units like this? I am disgusted with such thinga being foisted on the public. Where is WAterPIk's quality control?
3,Waterpick WP-65 Personal,"This product replaced my WaterPik personal unit which lasted barely 3 years. The problem I had with thatunit is similar to this...the pumping of the water from the holding container to the jet isn't reliable...This unit too, works erratically, and I have to constantly reposition and reset the container filled with water on the base. Sometimes no water comes out and I realize the contact might be off...When I say ""contact', I'mtalking about the small rubber ring on the bottom of the water container having to meet the rubber ringthat sits on top of the motorized base. If it's slightly off, no water comes out of the jet...Half the time I thinkit's perfect and it's not. So, something about the design of this unit isn't right..I gave it 3 stars because whenit works, it works fine...I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what a perfect contact IS..and most of thetime, there's nothing obvious to notice."
5,Great product so far!,"I read many reviews and some good and some bad.So far I love this WaterPik!Only had it a short time, but no problems at all.Dentist said I needed this because of my dental problems.My teeth and gums have never been better!"
3,WaterPik,"There is not much to say about a waterpik. This one arrived promptly, was well packed and worked.The disadvantage of this one is that the top does not fit when you are through. The actual pik is in the way.I shopped around however and for me this is the best model. May be it is time to design a more practical one.The cord is long enough to reach anywhere on your bathroom counter.I had the identical model before and it worked for years, until mysteriously the water stopped flowing throuhg the handle."
4,Waterpik Water Flosser,I have an older model of this Waterpik Flosser that I have had for years and has worked very well. The new one is similar to the old one seems to work about the same. I only wish it had a cover on the water tank to keep out the dust etc.
4,Powerful rinse,"I had scanned reviews of other water flossers and didn't want one that was too ""weak"". This one is just right. It has settings from gentle to really blast the teeth and gums. I have no complaints. I can see the things falling into the sink that brushing alone didn't catch. I think this is a good buy and definately cleans your teeth and gums."
4,Good but Splashy.,"Effecive product to clean gums and in between tight spaces of teeth. However, it does splatter quite a bit, so you have to really lean close over the basin. My dentist told me that there are Waterpik shower attachments. This would seem a more efficient way of accomplishing the same thing, without the mess, and without the minor assembly/disassembly each time."
2,Bought 2 - both broke in less than a month,The first one I bought broke in less than two weeks. The second lasted barely a month. I suggest buying something else.
4,Great choice,Recently visited my dentist and he told me that my teeth were perfectly clean. Is a great alternative to traditional flossing
5,Great product,"This item is nice and compact, but on the load side. Overall, we really love this Waterpik and recommend it!"
1,There is a manufacturing flaw-DO NOT ORDER ONE,"I have used this device for over 20 years. My ""old"" one has worked flawlessly for over 10 years. I am now returning my THIRD ""new"" one all of which have failed within 30 to 60 days-pump fails to pump water thru pic or fails to have proper pressure. Do yourself a favor DON't buy one."
2,Leaky Hoses,"I have been using Water Piks for over 30 years and I believe that the use of Water Piks has been a major factor in helping me to maintain the condition of my teeth and gums.During this period I have had quite a few different Water Pik units (I'd say at least 6). In most cases I have had to replace the units because of leaks in the hose. The cost of repairing the hose almost equals the cost of a new unit, so I always end up buying one. I object, not only to the cost of replacing my Water Pik every few years, but also to the effect on the environment of discarding so many of these machines."
4,does the job but could be designed better,"This machine does the job, no doubt about it. The powerful water jets clean all food debris away and massage my gums - I have braces so I use it instead of flossing, and my dentist said my gums were fine. The only problem I have with it is the design of the water reservoir. First of all, you can't fill the tank without picking up the fairly bulky apparatus and putting it underneath the faucet. I have a small sink so it's somewhat of a nuisance to do this. Secondly, the water reservoir isn't really 'attached' to the base at all, so it's pretty easy to knock the reservoir straight off of the base when moving it around or even turning it on, spilling water everywhere."
5,Waterpik,Waterpiks are such a vital part of complete dental hygiene and this one does an excellent job of eliminating remaining food between teeth and on the gumline. I recommend it as a daily part of oral hygiene.
1,"short life, cheap product, expensive to fix :-(",It worked very good for about 45 days an then dead!DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT!!!
5,I enjoy it very much.,"It's the only way that my mouth feels really, truly refreshed in the morning - that is to say, my teeth and tongue do not taste either like morning grossness, nor does it taste like toothpaste or mouthwash, and instead my mouth simply feels clean with the use of this product."
1,disapointed,The Waterpic does the job it was designed to do but it is very noisy and has a cheap sound to it. I would not recommend this product. You may be able to spend a few more dollars to get a much better machine.
1,Poor quality horrible customer serice,"I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device's tips quality. The tips are extremely fragile. if the device tips over, they WILL break. Mine broke within 2 days. I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips. I will never buy another waterpik product."
3,WaterPik WP Personal Dental Water Jet,"Cleans debris between teeth very effectively, but the unit is very, very noisy. Also, difficult keeping connection clean."
5,Waterpik Water Flosser. It’s spectacular……………,"This product more than met my expectations. I used one of the older versions, this is far superior. I like the fact that replacement parts are readily available. If this unit ever wares out I will certainly purchase another."
2,Stopped working after a month.,One month after purchasing this Waterpik it wouldn't pulse water when sliding the selector to higher pressures. It seems as if the pause button was activating at the higher flow.
1,Dissappointed,"I had this model for 10 years before it broke down 2 months ago. I ordered the same model thinking if it lasted 10 years, it's good enough. Not so. I can't get a hard pulse; only works on the lowest pulsing. I have many caps so I must maintain healthy gums. I won't give up on Waterpik, however, so I am ordering the next model up and hoping I have better results."
1,"bad, bad, bad times 2","I thought I would go with the Waterpik name in that I have had their products in the past and got many years of use out of it. This particular model seems to work OK at first but within 60 days the control for the different settings stops working. You have to keep moving it from low to high to try to find one that works. Maybe it works for a day or two but then you have to try another setting.I have gotten this model twice, thinking I got a bad one the first time, but the second one had the same problems.I am a heavy user of these devices, using it twice a day. I would expect it would hold up to this use."
1,Great Concept - Poor Quality!,"The hose broke on my first WP-65 within the warranty period. The manufacturer replaced the unit but wouldn't guarantee the replacement unit. Within three months the handle of the replacement unit lost the ability to hold the piks and they would shoot out of the handle whenever I turned it on, rendering it unusable. I purchased my third WP-65 and within fifteen months the motor/pump seized. As an aside, all units were quiet when new but became excessively noisy within weeks - like a minature jackhammer. Can't someone at WaterPik design a high quality and reliable product?"
1,Don't Buy This,"Two of these have failed in two months, both for the same reason - the motor stopped working. I've used waterpiks for 10 years and never had any problems.It seems as if this company has seriously lowered it's standards. I will be trying another brand. I suggest you do the same."
1,Monumentally disappointed,"I was one of the lucky ones, I got eight months and two weeks use from my Waterpik WP-65 Personal Dental Water Jet. It works great, for a while. I plan on buying another oral irrigator but definitely NOT a Waterpik brand! This is also very loud which could be an issue for apartment dwellers."
1,Poor Quality Item,"I purchased one of these in June 2004. First one arrived and didn't work out of the box. Amazon was great and replaced it very quickly. Replacement item is now about three months old and has failed. Only used by one adult in the household. I would not recommend this unit. In all fairness I bought a WaterPik unit almost 15 years ago and it lasted until this year, in spite of the fact that it was used by two teen-agers and an adult!The WP-65 seems to be basically JUNK, I cannot recommend it to anyone."
1,Don't buy this item. If it breaks ( and it probably will) the Warranty is useless,"I bought this item 8 months ago. All of a sudden, it stopped pumping water. It has a two year warranty. Now, I have the option of shipping it back to the service center or buying another one. I need a water pik, but the postage and the hassle of sending it somewhere is simply not worth it. And the time it will take to get it back. This is how they make their money- they sell you something that is shoddy and give it a two year warranty then they give you no choice but to buy another one because when the time comes to make use of the warranty, the time and expense you have to take to make use of it cancels the benefit. If they gave it a 6 month warranty, I would not had expected so much. A two year warranty led me to believe this is a mugh better product than I thought. It is a sales tactic."
2,Waterpic,"It worked fine until last week, now the water does not come out right. Where the 2 black things connect , are not making the proper connection, for the water to flow out right. Have been using the product about a month. It is the waterpik water flosser shown here Mrs Jean Walker"
1,DISASTER,I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A CLEAR ACRYLIC COLOR RATHER THAN BLUE.THIS ONE BROKE AFTER JUST 6 WEEKS OF USE. IT WILL NOT GO FULL FORCE WHICH IS WHAT IS USEFUL TO KEEP MY TEETH CLEAN.THIS IS MY 3RD ONE BOUGHT OVER 30 YEARS. OBVIOUSLY NOT AS WELL MADE AS USED TO BE. VERY DISAPPOINTING.
3,WaterPik WP-65,Works OK but has sloppy design and/or manufacturing. Two examples: very hard to insert or remove pick from handle; jet force control knob in handle is loose and slides back and forth when using the WaterPik.
2,Worked good while it lasted,I purchased this model 1 and a half years ago. It worked really well until this week. The hose split where it enters the hand held end and it sprayed water all over the bathroom until I turned it off. I would have expected it to last longer.
2,they ain't what they used to be,"if i could find a substitute for water pic products, i would do so. they are poorly designed and don't last long at all. for a personal water pic, it is much too big. i had a personal waterpic a while ago that was small and lasted for quite some time."
4,"Nearly the same, lower price","The WP-65 replaced my six year old WP-70 on which the hose had finally developed a leak I couldn't fix. I wish they would have included their new under-the-gum spout and that they would re-issure the multi-holed sprayer that used to come with the appliance. Except for the color of the reservoir, this one is the same as and cost $15 less than I paid for the original. The only functional difference is the slider control on the head. The old one clicked distinctly into each of the five settings while the new one slips from one to another with just the slightest touch. I don't rate that an improvement. But if this one lasts as long as its predecessor, I'll count myself lucky."
3,Works OK,"I have had many waterpiks over the years. This one looks good, but it's operation is erratic, someimes feels like it's about to conk out, but it hasn't, so far so good, but not the best I've had."
1,WaterPik WP-65 Personal Dental Water Jet,These Item I purchase on 2/21/07 I used only for 3 week and it broke I do not kwon if I can return or not to have my money back or replace with another
5,Water-Pik Water Flosser,"This is a must-have for everyone who cares about dental and gum health. I had the same model purchased about 10 years ago, and the new one is a lot lighter in construction, weights a lot less, feels less sturdy. It came with the tongue cleaner which is great, but only one flosser, but the ones I had from the older Water-Pik fit perfectly, so no loss there. There are other brands in the market, but I recommend the original Water-Pik from Teledyne. It has been around for over 40 years and still going strong."
5,Real good,"Yes, it's working quite wonderfully. No problems. Meeting all expectations just fine. Thank you very much and best wishes to you all.Aloha, George"
2,ELECTRICAL PROBLEM,"WATERPIK DOES A GOOD JOB OF CLEANING AFTER 1 YEAR, WATERPIK KEEPS TRIPPING MY GFIC CIRCUIT SO CANT USE ITWROTE TO WATERPIK AND NO REPLY!!DR B"
4,"better the the ""old"" one","I looked for any make I could buy but Waterpic seems to have a lock on the market so I bought one and so far, it is doing a good job. It is smaller and works better than the old model I had (which lasted over 8 years)."
5,waterpicker,This is my second waterpick purchase. The first one lasted twenty years until the seal started spraying water. My dentist and I both loved it. I hope and expect this one to be just as good. If the noise bothers you get some earplugs and your teeth will last longer..
1,WaterPik WP-65 Personal Dental Water Jet,"BAD-BAD-BAD PRODUCT EXPERIENCE. THIS IS THE LAST MODEL WATER PIC; I DON'T KNOW IF THE 2 EARLIER ONES I USED WERE EARLIER MODELS (WITH SEVERAL YEARS' LIFE)WERE MADE IN CHINA, BUT THIS ONE WAS MADE IN CHINA. IT LASTED LESS THAN A YEAR---WITHIN WARRANTY. THEY SENT 3 REPLACEMENTS FOR A TOTAL LIFE OF THE 3 A TOTAL OF ONE YEAR MAXIMUM; AND I RETURNED 2 OF THEM SO THAT MFR. COULD ""INSPECT"" THEM. THEY ALL SEIZED. MFR CLAIMED I SHOULD EXERCISE MORE CARE IN RINSING AND USING. I NEVER RECEIVED THEIR ""INSPECTION"" RESULTS.I FINALLY REPLACED WATER PIC WITH A CONAIR ""INTERPLAK"" (MADE IN CHINA) MACHINE WHICH I HAVE BEEN USING OVER 2 YEARS---RELIABLY!!!---AT BEDTIME, SAME USAGE PATTERN AS I USED WITH WATER PIC."
1,didn't work at all,"I have had another water pik which I wore out. This one did not work AT ALL and I returned it for a refund, because of the hassle of shipping, I chose to buy another locally and that one works just fine."
1,poor workmanship,"Lasted 2 weeks Return for and second one and that lasted 2 weeks. No suction, very loud bought Waterpik ultra water been a month now works great"
2,Would be awesome,"The WaterPik works much better than floss for me...when I can actually get it to work. Since the second week I've had it, it has worked intermittently. After tearing the thing apart, which was no easy task, I discovered that a very small part was not letting water pass through it. After calling WaterPik for a replacement part, I was told that the piece can not be sold individually and that I would have to replace the entire assembly. I decided to continue trying to use it when it worked until it stopped working completely, now because the pause button on the handle is not responding. I have now only had the product for two months and it already needs completely replaced!"
4,Loud but effective,"This is the third time I bought this model. It works well but the noise level can be a bit high. I could not hear the door bell ringing the other day while using the machine. However, if I were to buy again, this is the model for me because it is effective, practical and easy to carry."
1,waterpik,"I have used waterpik for years...the older models lasted a long time. My latest waterpik broke after just two weeks...the pump stopped working. Prior to that, the waterpik I had lasted one year. I don't have time to drive 25 miles to the nearest service center and hassle...I don't intend to buy any more of these. A friend has an interplak, and it has proved reliable."
1,WaterPik WP-65 review,"design seems flawed a bit for the container. when you pull the cord out, it bumps the tank off sometimes. the tank also seems a little loose when mounted.i tried the newest Ultra Dental water pik type, but it only lasted 1 month then began to leak water."
4,Cleans well,"Works well, is quiet unlike some other water flossers. The adjustable pressure control is great. I would definitely recommend this as it works well."
2,Only if you are already an environmentalist,"I bought this book because it sounded like an interesting book which could convince me that environmentalism is good and correct.But I found that I could not finish reading it. I am perfectly happy reading very dry and (to other people) very dull, long economics books, but I could not finish this one. I promise you: I really tried to read the whole thing. But even after several attempts I couldn't force myself to read past the third chapter.Maybe if you are already an environmentalist, you may find some value in this book. But if you are unconvinced that environmentalism is correct before reading it, then you will not get convinced."
5,I Am Spoonbender walk all over the new new wave pretenders,"So much more going on than what is happening in ANY of the fields this band happens to touch upon: metal (NEUROSIS' bass player is on this!), postpunk, pop, laurie anderson-esque commentary and innovation, and with trippy yet sharp lyrics...!complex music masquerading as futurist art-pop. Don't make the mistake of lumping them in with.. uh- anyone. five stars."
5,Zatoichi on DVD Yeah!,"Well I have to admit that I am a Zatoichi freak. I have all these movies on VHS, but they are so good I will have to get them all on DVD as well. I can honestly say, for me that is, that I have never been dissapointed in any Zatoichi movie I have purchased. I can watch them time and time again and never get tired of seeing them. This type of movie making is a lost art today as well as the kind of character Zatoichi portrays. The action is great as well as the stories and the acting in these films. Thanks to great places like Amazon.com these movies can now be had by people who live in rural places that would otherwise be unavailable. I highly reccomend these movies, that is the whole series to anyone who likes good honest entertainment.Try one of these out, you may be surprised how much you enjoy it."
5,Samurai Classic,"This is not a chop socky film. This is not about gore, or magic, or even tons of martial arts action. But it is a great drama, about extraordinary men in extraordinary times. And yeah, not everybody lives."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"In today's age, there are so many martial arts movies that glorify the killing, and little of the rest of the package that makes up a martial artist. In my opinion, this film surpassed all my expectations. The emotional depth of this film went far beyond the uninvolving MA films of later generations. I truly enjoyed the sub plots of the movie - especially the friendship that developed between Zatoichi and the man that was supposed to be his enemy, Master Hirata.I recommend this highly to any person who wants to expand their martial arts library."
5,Janus does it again!,"The first Zatoichi film I ever saw was ""Zatoichi vs. Yojimbo"" and it left me feeling biased to the older, B/W films as well as stuck on ""Seven Samurai"". Like a number of other ""samurai"" pics, this isn't just slash and rip non-stop mayhem- there's a story going on here. I would compare this first in the series to the story in ""Yojimbo"" where two sides are being played against each other, and in Zatoichi's case there's another swordsman whose skill and respect is thrown into the equation. Shintaro Katsu exudes a quirky air of dangerous skill mixed with worldly determination, and plays blind convincingly. I bought this without having seen it already and I must say it was a pleasant surprise! There IS plenty of action, the pace doesn't necessarily lag on account of side-story, and Janus Films provides yet another beautifully restored widescreen print with clear and easy-to-read subtitles. This is a good buy for the price and I plan to get as many of the series as I can..."
1,The brim sucks,"Great color, great team but horrible brim. I tried to form the brim of the hat and it creased. I could never get the brim to bend the way I liked it. I couldn't remove the crease. I assume the brim was made from cardboard. Stay away!Go Phillies!!!!"
2,don't waste your money,Only my worst musical purchase ever. It was recommended to me because of my infatuation with PFR--supposedly they sound exactly alike. I beg to differ. The style and content definitely leave something to be desired. My recommendation--stick with the original...the only...PFR.
5,the great book adventure,"I live in mexico most of the year and getting books is sometime impossible. So when I get one I like, I would like to shout. Hurray!"
3,It was ok but not the best book I've read in my life butt it was ok,It was OK but not the best book ever since I have long time I read it and it was OK like I said
4,I like this book,This was a good book. It had great characters like Keith the little boy who owns the motorcycle and Ralph the mouse who drives the motorcycle.The story is about a mouse and a boy becoming friends and overcoming obstacles that are in their way and ofcourse Ralph riding his motorcycle.
5,Kids love this!,"I am a beginning teacher and read this aloud to my students, who went ecstatic with the story. This laid the groundwork for several class discussions and teachable moments for informal learning. I recommend this to any elementary teacher or parent; good, quality summer reading."
3,Great story. Whiny narration.,"My son loves this series. The story, of course, is wonderful, but B.D. Wong's narration is grating. The characters voices are all some version of whiny. Not even close to how I imagine these characters sounding. If you don't find that annoying, you'll be well pleased with your purchase. I wish there were another version with a different narrator. I would buy the whole set."
4,rescue from the past,"I loved it as a child. I must have read it a hundred times - translated into my native language. Then I lost it. The book in my native country had until then long gone out of print. But I never forgot that little mouse (though unfortunately the author's name). From time to time he kept showing up with his shining red motorcycle. Yesterday I happened upon the title in a New Yorker article and learned that I share my passion with a nine year old boy, Dernard, living at the Shrimp Boat. One chance in a million. Tonight, thanks to him, I will order it. I am happy."
4,Got to read it!!!!!,This book is very interesting. I would give it 5 stars. It was funny. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,5star,I CHOOSE THIS BOOK 5 star because it has been a really good book. I love the imagination in it
5,I LOVE this book,I loved this book so much that I downloaded Ralph S. Mouse and Run Away Ralph S. Mouse all by Beverley Clearly!
5,very good kid book; fun and fantastic!,"The characters were very likable and any one can identify with them. The mouse and the small boy both liked the speed,action, and adventure of riding a motorcycle. This gave them a common essence in building a relationship that led to a friendship."
4,Thumbs Up!,I would give this book a thumbs up.I would share this book with my friend because he likes motorcycles.
3,Katherine's Review,This book is an OK book. I just did not find this book entertaining enough to keep my attention.
3,The mouse and the motorcyle,"1. Mouse and the motorcycle2. Beverly Cleary3. Harper Trophy4. Chicago5. 20006. 5.957. In this story a mouse named Ralph finds a motorcycle and takes a ride on it. He then falls into a garbage can and is taken by a boy out of the garbage. From that day on the boy is nice to Ralph and lets him have the motorcycle to play.8. Ralph a mouse, and Keith the boy9. It teaches kids that rats are not so bad to hang around and play with and if you use your imagination any thing is possible.10. I would tell kids to read this book because you can learn a lot of things"
4,The Mouse and the Motorcycle,"Ever talked to a mouse?Do you love mice?Well if you have not, and if you do, then this is a book for you. This book is about a mouse named Ralph, and is a book for all ages. He lives in a hotel on the second floor with his mom, dad, and cousins. One day a boy named Keith comes in. With Ralph's adventurous mind, and Keith's giving personality, it will keep you reading for hours."
5,Wonderful!! A classic book for all ages.,"There are probably over 900 zillion books out there, and of all of them, this is my favorite. I love the cute sketches, witty little humor, and imaginative storyline. ""The Mouse and the Motorcycle"" follows the ""tail"" of Ralph the mouse, who's dream is to just spend those wonderful hours riding down the hallway on a red motorcycle, and keeping the bond between him and Keith (the boy) alive. I've already read the book over 20 times, and still don't get tired of it. Defenitely a treasure of all of Beverly Cleary's stories."
1,The mouse,I loved this book it was so wonderful when I was reading it I got scared then relieved when it was better
2,not what I thought,I was hoping it was a book that my 4 yr old granddaughter would enjoy but its meant for older kids :( Wish I could find books for the younger kids on here
5,A Kids Review!,"Ralph, the mouse, was riding his motorcycle when he fell off the table and into the trash can. He waited an hour. Then Kith came into the story. He saw Ralph and his motorcycle (which was Kith's) and it was bent up. Kith took the motorcycle out, and Ralph climbed up Kith's arm. Later, Ralph was captured by two teachers. They let him go. He was hanging on a vine. An owl saw him and tried to eat him.I like Ralph because he had a lot of humor. He reminds me of me because he likes to eat. My favorite part was when Ralph's mom thought that Kith was in charge of room service.I recommend this book for the kids that like mysteries and mice."
4,The Mouse and the Motorcycle,"V-room, v-room, and v-room. If you can imagine a four-inch rodent driving a motorcycle, well, then, your imagination still isn't powerful enough for Beverly Clearys, The Mouse and the Motorcycle. Keith is a young boy who goes on vacation with his family to Mountain View Inn, in California. There he befriends a mouse named Ralph, who is very friendly and even talks. Then Ralph discovers that Keith has three toys that he brought with him on his trip. He discovers an ambulance, a sports car, and the one that most excited Ralph, a motorcycle. Throughout the book you will follow Ralph and Keith on many glorious adventures. I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. The Mouse and the Motorcycle is a great book for parents to read to their children and have a blast doing it."
2,The mouse and the motorcycle,A mouse named Ralph goes on a brave adventure to help a boy named Keith who is sick that needs a aspirin
3,A pleasant evening on the couch,"This is a pleasant light comedy from the 70's.Sidney Poitier as a milkman-hypnotist plays a relaxed straight role, with his sidekick, the refreshing Bill Cosby...they make a good team, and complement each other's characters perfectly.Jimmie Walker as the gormless ""Bootney Farnsworth"" provides a reasonable number of laughs.This is not a laugh-out-loud comedy, but a gentler, happier format...mild pleasant humour, of a feel-good escapist variety.A good buy for fans of the irrepressible Bill Cosby."
5,A comedy classic,"Hiawatha aka 'Biggy' Smalls, Bootney Farnsworth... you gotta be kiddin' me. Those names alone are enough to get you laughin'. Add to that Jimmy Walker as the defending middleweight champ then throw in Coz and Sidney Poitier as two small time hustlers trying for a big score by hyptonizing Bootney to believe he's a ferocious and unbeatable fighter. Absolutely hilarious.The outfits that Cosby and Poitier wear are classic 70's. Bold, brash, colorful, and outrageous.I just watched this again recently and I laugh just as hard every time I see it.Just sit back and enjoy"
4,Black comedy classic,"I loved this movie I can remember when it first came out it was a real big movie back in the days with a really big black cast it was one of the big antisapated movies at the time and with me only being young its PG rating help me get access inside the movie house.I recommened this movie to all those as they use to call them back then black explotation movies if you love a good comedy for the whole family to get a laff this is the movie for you white,black and all."
3,A funfilled film you can watch with your kids!,"Clyde Williams and Billy Foster are a couple of blue-collar workers in Atlanta who have promised to raise funds for their fraternal order,the Brothers and Sisters of Shaka. However, their method for raising the money involves travelling to New Orleans and rigging a boxing match. Using hypnotism, they turn the scrawny underdog into a super-confident fighting machine. They bet heavily on him, he wins easily, and they return to Atlanta with their money. All is fine until the gangsters conned by these two figure out what happened show up in Atlanta with a grudge. Now Williams and Foster have to rig the fight again so the gangsters can get their money back or they'll be killed. Can they do it again...? The execution of the score sucks, but it's still a good movie. Thank you for reading my review. -Bootney Farnsworth, the champ!"
5,Wonderful,I used to watch this movie all the time as a little kid and have been searching for it for years! It's so excitibg to find it i DVD and in such great condition. Truly a wonderful buy!
5,Enjoyed the movie,"I have seen this movie so many times that I just can't remember. I purchased it so I could view it anytime. It is so funny and it is clean enough that all your family members can enjoy it,too . When Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby team-up, then you know you are in for a funny and enjoyable movie"
3,Kohler K9619-CP Soap dispenser Polished Chrome,I ordered it as a replacement for one like it that is not pumping properly. The one I received is way smaller in capacity that the present one. It is too much of a hastle to send it back.
3,"Great Dispenser, Dinky Bottle","I got this to replace my leaky Grohe dispenser. The Grohe design has the plunger part larger than the base and fits over the base. So,, when it leaks a little it runs down the base and I always had a soap mess around the base. This Kohler design has the plunger being smaller than the base and fits inside it. So,, if it should ever leak or weep it will simply run down back into the bottle. Nice design on that part. The bottle on the other hand is a dinky little 8oz. Maybe just me but I find it annoying having to fill these things so often. And good luck trying to find a larger bottle with the same threads on it. I actually modified this and fashioned a new bottle out of pvc pipe and tripled the capacity. Works like a champ now. I'm working on an even bigger bottle so when I need to fill it I can simply dump a whole large bottle soap in there and toss the empty. (my girlfriend just shakes her head) Kohler should at least offer a larger bottle as and accessory."
1,Not impressed,"I bought this travel mug for my husband who is a HUGE Bears fan and who likes to drink coffee. It looks really nice and it felt like it would be pretty durable... not the case. First the outside logo piece came off after about a month and had to be super glued back on. A few months after the logo issue the inside of the cup started to come loose. FYI - it is NOT stainless steel inside, it appears to be a black plastic type material. Needless to say after trying to super glue the inside part so it would not come out, and using it for a little while longer, the travel mug finally got tossed. For the price you pay, I would not recommend buying this product."
2,"Beautiful tumbler, but the lid leaks",This travel mug sits on my shelf because it has leaked since the first time I used it. The lid did not not seal very well and coffee leaked out. I'm sorry I spent so much money on this.
4,Works well with moisture,I bought this to put around my 11 year-olds wrist so he would quit dropping expensive fishing rods off the pier at the beach. It attaches and detaches easily and water doesn't seem to effect its usage. Good product but I thought a little pricey but you get what you pay for.
4,No Beggar's Oil!,"This is a very good video, but honestly I bought it because I really wanted to learn to play Beggar's Oil. So I was really disappointed that the booklet included tabs for every song except Beggar's Oil. That's just not right -especially since I'm not all that crazy about the other selections. Instead of including the tabs and video instruction for playing Beggar's Oil, the DVD only features a Kelly performing Beggar's Oil at the end of the DVD. Disappointing!"
5,Time stood still,"I didn't know Vern Gosdin had done anymore recording since his stroke around 92'.I recently found here at Amazon while looking up Davis Ball and Marty Raybon--that Vern had almost a new record every 14 months since 98.(Country Music Magazine did a dis-service by not letting us know this- before they went out of business .)> Vern combines soul,anguish,heartache and all kinds of feelings into his songs that are so smooooth-you cannot help but feel every emotion and want more. Happily- now-, I own every thing he's done(thru Amazon). If you go to his web-site you can vote for him for CMA Hall of Fame---long over due. Sheila Richardson"
5,Time Stood Still by Vern Gosdin,A great CD by a traditional country music singer. Vern Gosdin put his heart and soul in his music. I greatly recomend this CD.
4,What is with the boys wildlife hair?,"Wow, the doll is nice but the hair is a little weird. They are also making a Cloe and Yasmin wildlife doll."
1,This is a cheap reproduction!,"Misadvertised! I forgot to check the reviews before i ordered. This is not a original military sling! I could have bought the same piece of junk for 5.00, Thanks for misrepresenting a product. It may work on a airsoft gun. Refunds are always a pain so it looks like my kids will use it on their toy guns"
1,SKS Military Sling (NOT!),"This product is not an SKS Rifle sling! This is for an AK-47!It's ashame that the seller hasn't taken the time to learn the difference. Fortunately I have friends who have AK-47s and I have a Hi-point Carbine for which I can use the sling. The product is well made as most slings for AK-47s are, but the SELLER SUCKS!"
5,Wonderful,"This product does exactly what it says - Now I can keep the cabinet doors shut and still change the channel. Before I had this product, my little girls used to open and shut the cabinet doors because we had to change the channel. Wonderful!"
2,Be Careful - Compatibility,"Very simply, these remotes and accessories have different radio frequencies in the americas and europe. i have a remote i bought locally (non-us) and a rf extender that i bought from amazon us. They do not work together. I wish I had read about this earlier and not placed this order (obviously). Now I don't know what to do with it."
1,Very Unreliable Product,"The setup instructions for this product are totally inadequate as is the online troubleshooting help. With phone support, I was able to get the product working, but after a few days the H1000 lost communication with the extender. After two hours of undocumented procedures with technical support, it was working again. After two more days the problem reoccured. The fix seems to be to reload the firmware and software in both the remote and the wireless extender. If it fails again and it is too late to get a refund, I will throw it in the trash and go back to IR communication on my H1000."
3,Works as advertised - Significant button delay,"This unit works exactly as advertised and the product was simple. My only beef is the significant delay between pushing a button on the remote, and the IR signal begin send. I suppose this might be inevitable, but I also use an IR range extender and that unit doesn't introduce any delay at all that I can detect. The delay isn't problematic except when you want to flip through menus, etc. Then it's almost unbearable. I decided the RF feature wasn't worth it because of that and returned mine."
4,Powerful Device but only use if you have hidden appliances,"This device has a very powerful blaster, but if you have an installation where the DVD player or CD player or whatever might get a signal from the Remote as well as from the Wireless Extender, it is not a good thing to use, as there is a time delay between the signal from the remote and the one from the extender, which can result in a device with a toggle on/off switch (as most devices now use) to turn on and then back off again. If you use this blaster, you must completely isolate your appliance from the signal from the Remote and from the other IR blasters too."
4,RF Extender,"RF, wasn't what I expected. I wasn't aware that it could only run 4 devices so that left me with the fifth device, not being controlled by the RF"
5,"Must buy it with hormany 1100, AWESOME","I have Logitech Harmony 1100 remote ,the Logitech Harmony RF Wireless Extender work AWESOME with it..... AWESOMEIt allows use of the remote in installations where my equipments is not directly in line-of-sight with the remote: behind cabinet doors,Or like my case I'm sitting (my home theater) in the front because I have a projector and all my equipments Rear so all my equipments is not directly in line-of-sight, etcThis is extremely simple to set up .....Go for it..... you won't be disappointed with Logitech hormany 1100, AWESOMEStrongly recommended ....."
1,Poor Electronics,The extender would not work in my home. The tech support rep suggested it was because we have wireless phones or because we have wireless internet router. The tech suggested we disconnect the phones and the router. That was not a viable option. We bought a simple system from the shack and it worked flawlessly.
4,Made the difference,"I originally purchased the Harmoney 900 and returned it because it just didn't work. I then tried the Harmoney 1100 but had to purchase the Harmony RF Extender which was not required with the 900. I am now convinced that the Harmoney 900 would have worked if I had purchased the Extender. In looking back, I would have preferred the 900, but at least the system now works."
2,Raw deal - Logitech Harmony RF Wireless Extender,I received a box with hardware. Included were no instructions or any other literature what-so-ever. I'm not so sure I received all of the hardware either since nothing says what the contents should be.
3,Does Not Suck,"Pros:1. All controls are in one place and the screens are relative easy to navigate.2. Help system (Remote Assistant) is extremely... helpful.3. Fairly easy to set up and program, particularly if your device is in Logitech's device database.4. Looks and feels sexy.Cons:1. Touchscreen buttons take some getting used to as does the delay when sending an RF signal.2. Your computer and internet connection must be within reach to program and troubleshoot devices. My computer is on the second floor of my house, so I get a lot of cardio everytime I change the setting or add a new device.3. Coming to the realization that you've just spent $500 on a remote control."
1,Too complicated,"This device requires that you glue on IR blasters in front of each of your devices. Then you have to some how store the wires out of sight. This is not exactly ""Wireless""! The picture of the device in the advertisement does not show the bundles of wires that need to be connected. This device is not worth the bother."
1,Was not needed,"Based on my research for the Logitech Harmony 890 remote, I thought I needed the extender. That is not the case. The extender comes with the remote. The return process was a nightmare, because of Amazon's third party retailers. Beware when purchasing throught the third party retailers, the rules of return and customer satisfaction change! EVENTUALLY, Amazon resolved all issues, but it didn't happen in their normally easy manner."
4,Have not used it yet,Bought this a while back with a Logitech remote but did not have a chance to use it yet. It seems to be a great idea for those that want equipment hidden somewhere further from the TV
3,Logitech RF Extender,"The unit functions satisfactorily. However, the speed of the signal transmitted to the remote units is very very slow...on the order of 1 character per second. Agonizing slow when you are trying to update over several fields."
3,Does the job,"I think my expectations were a little to high, the extender does the job but does not have a strong signal and seems a little slower."
1,Wireless Extender Quit for no Reason,"I purchased the Harmony Wireless RF Extender less than one year ago. It worked fine for about six months and then slowly became less responsive until it finally quit working all together. It would work fine if the remote was within line of sight, but if not, it was completely useless. I worked with Logitech's support for over an hour. They were less than helpful and it was quite obvious they had no idea what was wrong, they were just reading from a script. Then, they became rude and said I just needed to purchase a new one and that there was nothing they could do. Poor product, poor customer support."
5,Works great,"I'm using this in combination with my Harmony 1100 and I can sit in the Theater room and control components (A/V receiver, DirecTV DVR, BluRay player, XBox 360) that are located in another room behind a couple of walls."
1,No Directions with product I think it is used!,"My Logitech wireless extender came in a plan box no direction company responded quickly still no directions can't use it but,they refunded me $15 for my dissatisfation product cost $104 now what do I do with this product with no directions. This company is a joke don't order from them"
3,Needs hardware change,"Works well with both the Harmony 890 and 1000. Fairly easy to set up, though there are two HUGE drawbacks which Logitech should fix.1. They have hard-wired the cable to the Extender so that you have to unplug the unit whenever you want to upgrade the settings - a royal pain when it's plugged in behind your components.2. Even if you want to make a tiny change to the Harmony settings (e.g. changing a couple of icons) you have to update BOTH the Harmony and the Extender. This takes much longer and, because it's hard-wired, is very annoying."
5,890 remote,"This remote is absolutely the best value after you get it set up to your system components. It will take some work and maybe a call to tech support, but you will be happy with the end result. It took me some time(4hours) and a call to their very good tech support to finally get the last glitch out of the remote. The RF works great so I can keep the doors closed to my cabinet and still have full function control of six different components."
2,Not worth it,"So I got this with the Harmony 1100. I have a ps3 converter too. The lag between the remote->converter->extender->ps3 was so horrible I opted to use the ps3 converter only. The lag between the other components with the extender isnt as bad as the PS3, but they still are pretty bad. I'm read to disconnect the extender altogether and just rely on line of sight.It wasn't too difficult to setup, but I would definitely not recommend. My advice would be ensure line of sight and don't waste your money."
3,IR wires are poor,"The devices works great. I sync'd the extender and the Harmony 1000 and had everything working quite nicely. But, I am very unhappy with the IR wires. The adhesive on the emitters is very poor. Three of the five attached emitters fell off within the first 3 weeks."
4,Makes the 1000 work,We'll until Logitech gets the 1000 remote working like there lower end models this repeater really makes a big difference.
1,Don't buy this with Harmony One,"Even though this item is listed as an ""accessory"" to the Harmony One on Amazon's page, it isn't compatible with it. The Harmony One is IR only and cannot pair with the extender. Save your $100."
5,"Perfect, brilliant","First thing I must point out is what the other reviewer said:Even though the Harmony 1000 can control 15 devices, and this RF-IR is supposed to be an extension of the remote... and in fact physically is able to control however many devices that can be within IR-shot, however the useless logitech software only lets you select up to 8 of the devices in the list to be sent to the RF extender instead of the Harmony! but you could have 2 RF extenders. Note that the Logitech web site does not mention this limitation, and even says it can support all the devices that you can fit into the cupboard, so my advice is to complain to Logitech to either lift that restriction or send you a free additional RF extender to live up to their claim of 15 devices!"
5,Logitech Harmony RF Wireless Extender,Good easy and quick setup. Having to update through usb is a slight pain since you have to unplug the AC power cord when you plug in the usb. My extender is installed in a media built-in which makes unplugging this unit from a power strip an inconvenience but not a big deal.
4,RF!!!,great product... the radio frequency feature is awsome. i can be anywhere in the house and controll the hideaway appliances.
1,Works then doesn't work,This is a piece of garbage. It works then it flakes out then it works. I spent $350 with remote to turn my tv on manually.
4,Good But scaled Back,"I got this Camera For christmas. It's Good quality, Lightweight,Portable And a all around good camera. There were onle a few problems. There is no light on the camera there is suposed to be one but i duno what happend. The door is kinda flimsy i havent had problems with it but i would think that for some people that might be a drawback. i also noticed that the timelapse features are kinda bad but other than that it's a very good camera. If i were u and i was looking for a cheap good camera i would get it. I did"
3,decent,this is a good camera ...the door is flismyand i had the battery lose its charge several timesmy new problem is the viewfinder decided to give up on mewith a white screen ...grrrranyways it was an awesome camera while it lastedrock and roll!
1,Will not be to everyone's taste,"This novel was just not my cup of tea. It is written just like a pulp fiction dectective novel of the 1940's which is extremely appropriate considering it's a Dixon Hill mystery. I'd forgotten how badly written those stories could be-and a ""Hard Rain"" was pretty bad. I couldn't even finish it and that's rare for me."
4,Shallow but enjoyable,"This book is written in a fairly shallow, somewhat tongue-in-cheek fashion. With this author it is hard to tell if that shallow style is deliberate or not. Anyway, this does not read as a really serious or tense book, despite the situation the Enterprise is in. However it is definitely enjoyable. We have never had a chance to see Picard in the world of Dixon Hill for an extensive amount of time. Regardless of the circumstances, Picard is definitely enjoying the chance to spend so much time there. The 1930s detective genre is an interesting setting in itself. The characters are shallow, but they work well as a part of the story. There is also simply an enormous amount of action, of a very unusual type for the Next Generation: gunfights and shoot-outs. Finally, it is actually quite a mystery, and Picard is forced to do some hard deduction at the end, when all his leads seem broken, to finally solve it. I quite enjoyed it."
3,Cover art easily the book's best feature,"Having never before read a Star Trek novel, I was a bit reluctant to buy ""A Hard Rain"". However, I like Dr. Crusher, and I like Picard, and I love seeing them play characters on the Holodeck, so I went through with the purchase. I wasn't expecting Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but I wasn't exactly prepared for a writing style seemingly aimed at preteen adolescents. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the book was the author's overuse of similes. I just wanted to get through one page without something being ""like a..."". Additionally, the relationship between Crusher and Picard was never clearly defined. It appeared that the author wanted to convey a sense of romantic feelings between the two, but he just could not bring himself to do so. I wouldn't call the book a waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend it either."
2,"Oh, sigh...kinda disappointing.","I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting from this novel, but I'm pretty sure it didn't live up to my expectations, if that makes any sense. Dean Wesley Smith is one of my favorites, and the book's certainly written in his familiar style, but I think he fell short of the mark on this one. I kept waiting for the story to grip me, but it never did, and I figured it out way before Dix did.I did, however, LOVE the cover. As I have said in the past, I *do* buy books for their covers, and having met the artist, Sonia Hillios, at Shore Leave at the very time she had finished painting this one, well, I just had to have it when I saw it for sale.But unless you simply must have a complete set of TNG paperbacks or adore the covers like I do, you can skip this one and not be any worse for it.That having been said, I hope Dean gets a chance to try again, because I like the idea of Dixon Hill, and I'm sure Dean does, too."
2,"I'm Surprised at You, Dean Wesley Smith","Hard Rain was a very disappointing book. I had looked forward to a Dixon Hill novel, but this left me very unsatisfied. First of all, only three members of the Enterprise crew played a part in either of the storylines. Geordi was mentioned, as was Riker, but neither of them appeared. Worf, Deanna, etc. were forgotten. All of them should have played parts, just as the characters in Deep Space Nine did in the episode Our Man Bashir.Secondly there were too many minor characters, and all of them seemed to be interchangeable. Not one stood out with the possible exception of Detective Bell (not really a minor character). They had silly names and silly personalities.Thirdly, there were some good pulp fiction writers--Cornell Woolrich for one. The story could have been written much better. Dean Wesley Smith is usually very good, but not this time.It's not worth the money or the time. And, yes, I figured it out before Dixon Hill or Mr. Data."
2,:(,"I was excited to see a Dixon Hill book, but after I started reading I was disappionted. I like the author but this wasn't his best work. He should stick to writing about the future and not cheesy private eye novels."
4,Simplistic but Powerful Fun,"Some may say this, GF's second record, is a musically simplistic piece of work. But no one ever listened to Grand Funk for complexity. For a raw, burning power trio sound, this record is hard to beat. Lots of fun, funky rock 'n' roll and lots of sex in the first four tunes. The record gets heavier after that, including the longer concert staples In Need and Inside Looking Out, Mark Farner's climactic hard edged guitar playing on display. Only one throw-away tune: I just never cared for Paranoid. If you're looking for depth and complex musical layers, buy some Pink Floyd or Deep Purple. If you're looking to party and nothing else, put on this record."
5,"By Far, Their Best","I could just throw out all the other Grand Funk albums and be happy with this one. Well... I might like to keep Closer to Home and their first live album also. This album is relatively primitive in the recording, but it has such balls, such life to it, and every song brings out fond memories of their heyday.Don't even get me started on the direction they took when they added Craig Frost on keyboards and sophisticated their sound on their most well known work. To be fair, it is not Mr. Frost that was the problem, it was the Funk's overall sound and the songs that I didn't like. And what do you hear on the radio if a supposedly ""classic rock"" station even bothers to play any Grand Funk? American Band or Locomotion, of course. Bah humbug.If you want rock at it's finest, and especially the finest moment of this great band, this may be the only album you'll ever need."
5,All funked up!,"Great second album. Not quite as good as ""on Time"", but very heavy. I highly recommend it."
4,Wonderful!,My 8 year old loves this book! He is constantly reading off facts and trying to trick us. It has also challenged him to check on the facts in the Bible. He has learned a lot.
1,piece of trash,"Right out of the box the rivets were loose. When I used it I discovered that it was out of square by more than an inch. Empire's True Blue products are very high quality but this definitly is not. Also, this, unlike their levels, is made in china. Buy a Johnson."
4,Should have been 5 stars,"Love this thing, came in squared, rivits not loose like others have had, only thing i didnt like was that it was taped from top to bottom. took for ever to get it off and still some on it."
5,"A ""Must Read"" for the lover of truth","My family has been in the oil business almost since it began. Being a very curious person, I received satisfactory explanations on every aspect of the business with one exception; how oil was created. I have never believed that crude oil came from dinosaurs and plants. Everyone else seems to believe it but I didn't and so I looked for a more satisfactory explanation. That is how I came upon Mr. Golds book. His theory on the origin of oil is so compelling and answers so many questions, I have few doubts he will be proven correct in the future. In looking at this problem from so many different disciplines, he can see things that most people just cannot see."
3,"Some novelties, but ruined by intrusive typography","I collect atlases in a modest way and this is the most disappointing one I have ever purchased. The satellite pictures were a novelty on publication (although not now) and the context outline at the top right of each righthand page is an idea worth copying, but the style of cartography only works for large areas of vacant land. The maps of Western Europe in particular are incomprehensible even with a magnifying glass. In one map for example the name LONDON is printed on an opaque yellow background that entirely eliminates an area of land some sixty miles by fifteen - none of which is actually in London itself. It is in parts more of a low-resolution road atlas than a genuine geographical work."
2,not good,This was not a full version of the movie and many scenes had been deleted. It was a very used rental movie delivered in a very dirty case and the cover insert had been trimmed down.
5,LOVED IT !!!,LOVED IT WHEN IT CAME OUT MANY MOONS AGO AND LOVED IT NOW IT EVEN KEPT MY HUSBANDS ATTENTION >>
4,"Nice looking clock, just be aware that it is battery run","It is not a traditional grandfather clock. Pretty to look at, but runs on batteries, even the pendulum. The moon phase is just a plaque."
3,The start of the end,"Ice Cube - The Predator (Priority, 1992)After AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, Kill At Will EP, and Death Certificate, all classics, this album was a step down. Cube didn't really bring it like he did in the past. Ironically, this is the one of his most successful albums due to his singles ""Wicked"" and the the smash ""It Was a Good Day"". There are other good songs on here such as ""Now I Gotta Wet'cha"" and ""Check Yo' Self"" (the original, which is better than the more popular remix). Whatever fans Cube lost with this album, he sure gained a lot more. -EJR"
3,Like the Artist,"Ice Cube is a great artist and performer. Really did'nt notice when I purchased the CD, that it was not clean.That is the reason I gave it three stars, plus there are not many tracks on it that I like."
5,the predator,"this album was the jam back in the day.back when i was a little juvi everybody in the hood was pumpin this. today was a good day is and was a song that helped me get through alot and when things werent goin the right way me and my homegirl would cruise and chill to the album. this and the chronic are 2 of the greatest albums ever made. buy this for the strength,buy this for the social commentary. even if you are a white middle class kid from the country GOD BLESS YOU PEOPLE"
3,Not his best work,"Ice Cub changed his rap style on this album when his old one was just fine. The tracks on this one were mediocre. I recommend Ice Cube's earlier albums, ""Death Certificate"" and ""Amerikkka's Most Wanted"", which are hip hop classics."
3,Not Exactly Death Certificate Part 2,"This isn't exactly what I expected, however, Cube put a few really dope songs on this joint. 'The Predator,' 'We Had to Tear This MotherF-cker Up,' and Cube's best track ever, 'It Was a Good Day,' are all on this album. Since 'The Predator' and ' We had to Tear...' never appeared on rap compilations you should get this album just for those tracks. If you only like 'It was a good day,' I'm sure you could find it on a various artists CD. In conclusion, this is a pretty good rap CD, but if you love Cube, get Death certificate."
3,"Not Cube's best, but still an alright album","Ice Cube's first two solo-albums are classics, but his third, The Predator, is not. Don't get me wrong, it's still alright. On-point production and tight rhymes. Cube has changed his style a bit on his album, and tried some new formulas. He has replaced the West Coast funk-beats with hard underground beats. His lyrics hit hard, and you can still feel his anger on most songs on this album (not as much as on AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted or Death Certificate though).Still, this is good a hip-hop album and worth checking out. If you haven't got his first two albums, then buy them before you buy this, because they're much better."
3,Never change your style,"Ice Cube came out with the single wicked which was a different style than ""Classic Cube"". Note: Anytime a rapper changes his flow or style can be dangerous. Any rapper changing it to a tongue twisting style is just a recipe for disaster. Should have stayed the same but polished his flow. We'll always have death certificate."
3,can't go wrong with this one,let it go in two ears and stay in the brain. cube is in his prime here. i listened to this one on my bike and i never lost speed once!
5,Some of Cube's Best Work...,"An angry album, straight out of the '92 riots; this is one of the best albums Cube has ever put out. If you want the mentality of April 29, 1992, you need to get this album.Aside from the anger, there is not one bad song on the album. ""We Had To Tear This Muthafucka Up"" and ""Today Was A Good Day"" are probably the two best."
4,A good mix of hard and soft beats makes this album,A good album overall especially cube's hard hitting commentary on the L.A. riots. easily accessible and instantly likeable although not as hardcore as some of his early work as a result.
3,It is a mediocre compared to some of his other CD's.,I would not encourage someone to buy this CD. But I would encourage them to buy his newest CD.
4,An improved classic.,"I like albums of his from before and after this one, but if I had to keep just one, it would be ""The Predator"". There's numerous great raps here, like ""Wicked"", ""Dirty Mack"", and the huge ""It Was A Good Day"". Plus most of the skits hold up to repeat listenings also. I don't notice any major improvement from the remastering, but the extra tracks are awesome. The two remixes are cool, and ""U Ain't Gonna Take My Life"" is amazing. Both that track and ""24 Wit An L"" were previously on his ""Bootlegs And B-sides"" album. If anyone tells you this disc is wack, ""Don't Trust 'em""."
4,Downhill from here,"This was really Ice cube's last great album. After, he released a string of compilation-type albums and 2 sub par solo albums. Although this is far from Ice Cube's best album, it does have 2 of his best tracks: ""It Was a Good Day"" and ""check Yo Self"". This album is similar in almost every way to Death Certificate, it's just that aspects that made Death Certificate such a great album aren't quite as strong on this release. There are scattered other quality tracks, but the reason to buy this album would be to hear the 2 tracks that were mentioned earlier."
3,Just Okay,"This album lacked some of the elements of intensity, and realismfrom the previous two albums. However Ice Cube has some good traks like ""It was a Good Day"", ""Wicked"", ""Who got the Camera"" and ""Check Yo Self"". Honesty you should pick this up this album- but only if you a dedicated Ice Cube fan."
2,Okay - but not new,This product is overpriced for what it is. There really isn't anything new in it. I was disappointed in this purchase.
5,Great Gift !,"I love Iced Tea. The recipe for Beach Bourbon Slush is worth the price of the book! We made it one year at the beach and now friends call us ahead of time and say, ""You are bringing the Slush?"". It is a favorite.There are non-alcohol drinks that I love too. The spiced iced tea is now a Thanksgiving tradition.This book makes a great gift too. Even people who never cook, enjoy recipes for drinks. It is pretty, with lots of great photos. The recipes are easy and anyone can make them."
4,This is a wonderful children's album.,My son goes to sleep with this album at least 3 nights a week. It goes on car trips with us and is one of the few that you don't want to throw out the window after 50 miles. It contains many wonderful folk songs that kids and adults love to sing along with.
4,Music Education 101,"My husband and I purchased this cd for our new granddaughter. We believe that Doc Watson is a National Treasure, and are proud that he resides in North Carolina where we have multiple opportunities to see/hear him play. The songs are a little faster paced on this cd. ""Tennessee Stud"" is our favorite, and we're sure that Hannah will know all the words by the time she's able to talk!"
5,surprised,"I was disappointed at first because I was expecting the classis 60's songs, not the later English selections from the reconstituted band. But this CD really grows on you. ""The Songs We Used To Sing"" is the best retro medley type record I've heard. I play it all the time!"
5,The very best of the Drifters,"This is a very good recording. Orginal recording, orginal artist is the only type of CD to buy if you want it the way it was back when. The CD was high quality and I would recommend this to anyone."
4,GOOD SONGS AND VALUE,this cd has a good sound and variety of their greatest hits. you must be a drifter's fan to enjoy this one.
5,I LOVE THE DRIFTERS,You can listen to every song on this album over and over and still love it. When you hear the songs you'll wanna dance and sing along.
3,All mono recordings,"I was quite disappointed with this CD and Ben E King's "" The BestOf"" because both are mono records. Except when I heard the songsback then on the radio, on most LP's- released in the 60's-all of their recordings were in full stereo. The songs aregreat, no doubt, but should I have known this before I wouldhave chosen other ""greatest hits"" compilations in stereo."
5,A very important body of history!,"Odette is that rare body of work called a film that serves as a great history lesson. In this age of teaching through multimedia, this film should be in every school library. Anne Neagle is a star of the first rank and should not be forgotten. Travor Howard is at his best in a performance full of compassion, strength and lightheartedness. The film is played realistically without over the top cinematic gloss. I highly recommend it to be seen by every movie lover. As a PAL film it will play on a computer if the resoruces aren't available to convert."
3,Odette,I saw this movie as a very young girl and have waited for it to come on on DVD.We must never forget those people that were so brave in times that were so evil.
4,One of the best metal compilations I've seen,"This CD covers the bases. Crue before they sold out, Priest at their most accessable, Twisted Sister before they became MTV babies. This is the good stuff.It's hard to find a metal compilation without the likes of Skid Row, Poison, Slaughter or the like. This is real chainsaw rock.If you're a real metal head, you have all of these songs. If you're a current Limp Bizkit/Korn/Rage fan and you're looking back in time for the roots of the Angst sound, look no further and pick this one up."
3,A good show of Greg.,"While I enjoyed the playing on this CD, I was a bit disappointed. I think that he maybe went for too much. The sound quality is great. And obviously with someone like Greg the musicality is great as well, but the songs are unfocused. And by that I DO NOT mean that that the songs don't sound enough alike. The drum sounds and instrumentation sound different from track to track. I know that this is picky but there you go. If you like this CD however you would probably love Vinnie Coliautas'a CD."
5,It's Gregg,"What can you say about Gregg, he's as great a drummer as he is a person. This album showcases his many talents and diversity of his playing. One of the best players in the world Greggs album is full of his talents, personality and style. Along with Matt (his brother) on bass it's a ripping colletion of great drum featured music with groove galore. A great person, a great cd.. If you drum you must buy this album"
3,"strong smell, strong taste",I would classify this as a lower end toner. It has a very strong scent and if you get some on your lips it has quite an after-taste. So roll your lips inward as you spray. The spray bottle sends out fairly large droplets. I am just about finished with this bottle and am not planning to re-order. Should have stayed with Yonka.
4,FUN FUN FUN,"the storys are great fun reading,the stories are clasic and very well writen just a joy to sit down and relax and be taken to the s.pacific."
3,where is twain,"I have had great pictures with the RCA cds4100 digital camera.The pictures are clear and you can opt for a preflash or not,I chose not to. The functions are easy to understand and use.The only problem I have with this item is that when I went to install it on my pc it ask for a twain driver and this was not part of the package.Now before I can download my pictures I have to find a twain driver,what it is ,where to buy it and how much additional it will cost."
1,CDS 4100 flash card reader,I have one of these camera's also RCA cds4100..and can't get it to work on WinXP..where do I get one of these external flash card readers????Don
1,NO WINDOWS XP DRIVER,TODAY 9 OF 02/03 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND PEOPLE PROMOTING THIS PRODUCT IF IT'S NO RUNNING WITH WINDOWS XP ! ! ! !
1,Never Buying RCA,"ITS not just XP guys... its windows 2000 too! Sure you can buy MORE products just to use it, but why? RCA its going to lose A LOT of business on this on!"
4,"Although ""Are You Experienced"" Is Longer......","Even thought the other compilation of hits from Jimi Hendrix Experience called ""Are You Experienced"" has a lot more songs....this album does a great job of bringing together the actual best of. Smash Hits was even made after ""Are You Experienced"" but it still is a great set of groovy songs. ""Smash Hits"" forgot one song of Jimi's called ""Voodoo Child"" and that got me a little mad because without a doubt that's his best guitar playing. This CD is highlighted by songs like ""Fire"", ""Foxey Lady"" & ""Crosstown Traffic."" The CD does a good job with knowing Jimi for songs with the band and not his guitar as much. If you are trying to find a way to start loving Jimi Hendrix then you should buy Are You Experience just so you'll get the full experience of the greatest guitar player ever."
3,Eh... 2 1/2 stars,"I think that this is an OK Hendrix album but there is one mistake, IT IS WAY TO SHORT!!!!!!!!! If you want to get a really good Hendrix Album than just get ""Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix"" not this, don't get me wrong, I love Hendrix's music just not this album."
5,Excellent Career Summary,"This greatest hits album was released while Hendrix was alive, and is an excellent summary of his original hits. While there are more expansive collections that have been assembled, this collection is concise and to the point. The sound quality is also very good. I have seen used copies of this cd selling for less than $5, and for that price it is simply a steal. I am pleased that this has been issued, as it will please Jimi's original fans who grew up with this album."
3,Jimi Hendrix-'Smash Hits'(Experience Hendrix) 3 1/2 stars,"I can never slam ANYTHING that Hendrix has ever done,but the only purpose that 'Smash Hits' is likely to serve for anyone is to introduce a new(is there anyone on the planet that hasn't heard Hendrix's music by now?)fan.Okay,MAYBE a young teen that wishes to enjoy some of his parent's(or even grandparent's)music of days long gone.The cuts here have apparently been remastered.Tunes that I could never grow too tired of are ""The Wind Cries Mary"",""Fire""(one of my all-time Hendrix favorites),Dylan's ""All Along The Watchtower"",""Crosstown Traffic"" and ""Manic Depression"".For die-hards OR new fans."
2,Smash Hits?,"God...if you're going to make a compilation album, you should do it right. Because tweleve songs just is not going to cut it. Sure, the material that's here is great: all instant classics. But what about what isn't there? I don't understand what prompted the makers of this album to exclude ""Voodoo Child"", ""Little Wing"", or ""Are You Experienced?"". Sure, it's still a nice listen, but it was nonetheless thrown together in a very haphazard way.If you want a great Hendrix compilation, purchase the Experience Hendrix album. Sure, there are even omissions there, but it's the best one will get. But if I were you, I'd buy the albums. Each one is a classic, and even the less famous cuts will make you begging for more."
3,The only reason this gets three stars is for the presence of Purple Haze and All Along the Watchtower,"I have said that any Hendrix disc with Purple Haze and Watchtower gets at least three stars. And I stand by that claim. Sadly, the rest of the collection is in sorry shape. For one, NOTHING is contained from Axis: Bold As Love, too bad because If 6 Was 9 and Castles Made of Sand are two fine cuts. For another, Voodoo Child (Slight Return) was skipped. Why? I'm sorry, but that's inexcusable. And why are Can You See Me and Remember, average Hendrix cuts in my mind, included when you can do so much better with Jimi? Smash Hits simply doesn't make the cut."
1,More of the same,"It is now getting VERY SAD that we are getting yet another greatest hits CD of the same songs from the greatest guitarist ever.Fans around the world 'were' very happy to hear of the Hendrix Family getting the rights to Jimi's music.But the have now lost the plot completly.I have lost count of how many compilation CDs they have put out in only a few short years.This was the last straw.Of course the music is great and the songs still hold up well but my point is that there is still hundreds of hours of un-released music that must be heard.THAT IS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT. 'IT'S THE MUSIC'The music is what we pay to hear, not a different arrangement of the same songs or a different cover, it's discovering a new Jimi Hendrix song that we may not have ever heard, that is much more exciting for music fans in general.I hope I have made my point."
1,Jimi did not want this released!,"I can not believe the Hendrix Family decided to rerelease this, how ridiculous! This being released 30 years ago is irvelent to todays times with other collections. I highly recommend the ""Voodoo Child,"" double disk collection. It has all these songs including a lot more and a disk of live songs from different concerts. There just trying to make a few bucks, which they can't make much because Hendrix Fans aren't stupid. A really good rerelease would be JimiHendrix/OtisRedding live at Montery."
3,"Just like ""Lucky Chances"", the book ""Lady Boss"" is so much",better than the mini-series. I do like the casting of Kim Delaney as Lucky instead of Nicolette Sheridan. The role just suits Kim better. The mini-series is is entertaining but in my opinion not worth purchasing. Get the book or wait till it comes on cable again!
1,Wrong size shipped,"I ordered this 80mm fan and instead I got an 92mm fan it is not much of use for the purpose I had in mind, dont know what happen to the pérsons in charge of amazon shipment. Guess ill have to mod the 92mm somehow."
4,Good Book But I hope To Have a C# Source Code,"After Reading All The Book I think that this book deal very well with intranet applications but it is specific to understanding and upgrading the IBuySpy Portal Application but you can always use this knowldge in order to develop other intranet applications ,instead of building everything from ground up the authors learn us how to take advantage of an existing applications distributed freely and customise it .I gave the book 4 stars because the source code distributed with the book is in VB.Net and there is no C# version like other WROX Books and I hope that WROX will distibute the C# version of the source code soon ."
2,Mostly just code listings,"I didn't much care for this book. It never really explains the how or why, it just lists code. ""Now we'll add an edit button: <code...> Now we'll add a delete button: <code...>"". There's no explanation of what the code means, how the ASP pages link to the code-behind pages, etc.I'm not sure who the target audience is. It's not technical enough for geeky types, but too technical for administrative types. I guess it's aimed at script kiddy types who want to copy code without really understanding how it works."
3,Funk rawk,"Not to be confused with Slammin' Watusis or Smashed Gladys, Slammin' Gladys released their self-titled debut in 1992, right at the tail end of America's love affair with hair metal. Slammin' Gladys wasn't as slick and polished as say Firehouse or Slaughter, instead opting for a bluesier, funk-infused sound. The band benefited from the patronage of Warrant vocalist Jani Lane, who executive produced the album.The album is a perfectly decent serving of funk rock, but it's really nothing you haven't heard before. Bands like Electric Boys, D-A-D, and Bang Tango were also bringing this kind of noise, and did a more memorable job of it. Still, this is a fun album that will definitely get you movin' if you're into this kind of music. Standout tracks include Love is My Drug and the band's version of the Janis Joplin staple Piece of My Heart."
5,Outstanding,Keep my tires shining even in the rain. Hahahah. Love it when I go to a car wash and tell them don't put tire dressing on my car. Then when the wash is over I do it myself and they wonder where I got this from. Great stuff. And it was more than enough to split between me and my boys for two years. Will purchase again for sure.
1,Not what shown on picture and description,"The picture and the description of the book showed a book, and what I got were sheets to put in a folder. It should have said that some place. What I got was new and in good shape."
1,This book sucks,This has got to be one of the dumbest books I have ever read. Not only is it really short he quotes the bible almost every page. There is very little info on anything he did. Save your money
1,Not Long enough,I really liked the sound of this book and felt it would be an interesting read! Unfortunatly i was surprised at how short it was and how large the writing was! In my opinion the writer has a lot of knowledge and experience to share unfortunatly i felt i was reading a brief discription of this guys autobiography rather then the actual thing! He went on too much about jesus has saved him and not enough of why he needed saving!
3,Average,I did a report on Ramses2 and I used this book to help me. There wasn't much information and it was the same info.that I got from another book and the internet. I am now deperessed ever since I raed your book. i feel sorry for you.
2,"This is a Ridge Racer, not a Gran Turismo","Great graphics and cool looking menu. This is the typical ""Racing game"" and did decent job for that. But...if you love Gran Turismo, probably you wouldn't enjoy much, not for long. What's projected using fabulous graphics is completely against the physics and not even remotely close to real. No braking? No car can take every corner with simple gas lift off... And that whole drift points and nitro thing turned me off. I simply couldn't get into the game no matter how fabulous graphics is.This is the game fun watching not playing. If you love Gran Turismo, probably better wait Gran Turismo 5."
2,Meh...,Just another futuristic racing game. No signs of damage. Not terribly dynamic in the game play. Just kinda... meh.
1,Awful,Might be entertaining if you're 6 n don't know any better. One of the worst games I've ever played. Don't waste your money.
2,just like the rest,"Don't even think about buying Ridge Racer for the PS3 when there's already a thousand racing games on the PS1 and PS2 that are JUST LIKE this one. And for 50 bucks? If you spend that much money on this game, you will regret it later when the price is guaranteed to drop significantly, like all racing games eventually do. One day, this game will only cost 5 bucks, and you'll regret spending so much on it."
1,This is not the 3D version.,"I bought this game because I thought I was going to be able to get a 3D upgrade patch. I buy a lot of 3D games. But, there is no update for a disc game. If you want the 3D version you have to pay $19.99 at the playstation store for the whole game. There is no other option if you want that version. Very disappointing."
4,Nice racing game,"I really like this game. It is easy to get into and there is great varity with the cars, tracks and race surroundings. The only thing is that to get to higher levels it is best if you can also play online against other racers... But for the rest this is lots of fun!"
3,A bad ride in heaven,"Pros: Fast paced racing game; futuristic cars and nice graphics; drifting is funCons: Sound and music make your ears bleed; physics engine resembles the '90's; winning races is almost impossibleOverall this is a good buy for someone who likes to see how much the PS3 can do but the game experience is a bid letdown when you have titles like ProStreet, Dirt or even Carbon."
3,RR7 so so,"I'm not a pro gamer but have played this game enough to realize both advantages and limitations:pros:good scenery and car graphic detailnice music even at beginning levelsinnovative routes and drifting adds a nice touchcons:lacks realism, it feels the car is in autopilot at timesif you memorize the corners better than rivals you'll end up placing well no matter how skilled you arecars look much better in preview then when the game is played(disappointing)"
4,Solid Racing Game,"I found this game to be very enjoyable even without the rumble feature on the PS3. 'Career Mode' is interesting and gaining cars must be bought or won. Additionally, each brand gives you points for each race you win with THEIR car which puts a new twist in a typical racing genre. I found this product to be more enjoyable than NFS or PGR."
3,Ridge Racer 7,This game offers a all-new racing experience if you like movies like fast and the furious or games like Need for Speed or just plan racing then this game is for you.
2,Absolute Trash!,"I purchased Ridge Racer 7 recently and I realized very soon that it was a very bad game. First of all, it is the hardest racing game I have ever played, and I have years of experience with racing games. I spent almost 30 minutes beating the first race! The in game experience is very poor, and I felt that the gameplay was always either exaggerated or boring. Save your time and money, and buy a good racing game such as Project Gotham Racing, not this."
2,Sad,"Let me first say that I only played the demo version, so I may be missing some important features. Drifting is hard to get the hang of in this game, but this is not the point. The physics are horrible. Arcade physics is acceptable when the game has something to offer in terms of gameplay and fun. This one has neither. I'm sure someone who loves ""drifting"" and arcade style racing games will like this, maybe. Graphics are only ok considering what some other, current or upcoming, PS3 racers offer. Try the demo at the PS store before you buy."
1,Weird physics. NOT a racing sim.,"If you want something that is realistic, do not buy this game. I play Motorstorm frequently, and am a big fan of the Gran Turismo series. I love racing games. This was just a lot of weird drifting. Personally, I hated it."
4,3D software upgrade will not work with game,"I really love this game and wanted to pick it up to try out the 3D feature. My review is based on trying the 3D experience. Unfortunately, the 3D feature is not possible with this Disc. When you load the Disc into your PS3, it downloads an update (v1.01), but you cannot get update v2.01 which allows for 3D play. I searched all over for answers and it seems like Euro and Asia got the patch for free while the US made it available for a few months then stopped distributing it. The only way to get the 3D license version to buy the full game via the PS3 Store for $20. It seems unfair that they allow people to buy the game on disc but deny the 3D License upgrade. It's still a great game so my rating still stands but I wished the disc was eligible for upgrade."
5,The greatest racing game of all time,"Next to motorstorm, this is the next big racer on the Ps3. Great Graphics and awesome looking cars. I just can't stop playing. A must have for any racing fan like myself."
5,amazing game but no need to buy it,"this is really a wonderful game, this is one of the best race game on PS3there is nothing i need to say about game, bucuz it is 5 star game forever!!!also, the new system is amazing, you can upgrade your card and desgine ur onw color to the carbut a new rage racer if coming, so i thought you don`t need buy this game for now unless the new game is badtherefor, i give 5 star to this game, cuz its really nice!!!!!but i recommand buyers, buy the new one instead of this game"
4,Gorgeous views of the stars,"I bought this eyepeice hoping for some better magnification than my current eyepeice. I did my math wrong and this did just the opposite. So initially I was a little upset. However, once I realized just how useful this eyepiece was it is now one of my favorites.I have an Orion XT-8. This eyepiece cannot be inserted completely into the focuser as it will not focus if you do. Luckily the adapter sleeve is very long on this eyepiece and you can pull it out about 1/2"" before tightening the set screw. With it pulled out about 1/2"" you can get great focus and an AMAZINGLY clear and wide field of view. This eyepeice is great for observing constellations and galaxies.The view is breathtaking."
4,A great general purpose low power eyepiece,The Meade Series 4000 Super Plössls are an improvment over the 3000 series Plössls. The 26mm is the standard eyepiece supplied with most Meade telescopes. This eyepiece offers a magnification of 48x on an ETX90 or 77x on a 2000mm focal length telescope like the LX90.
4,Very worthwhile EP,"This is the one that gets used the most, along with the Meade 32mm Super Plossl. These 2 EPs plus a good 2x barlow is about all you need."
4,Quality high power plossl,"This Meade eyepice is of excellent build quality. It offers very good resolution of the planets, moon, starclusters, planetary nebulae, and double stars."
4,A great general purpose medium-high power eyepiece,The Meade Series 4000 Super Plössls are an improvment over the 3000 series Plössls. The 12.4mm is used for medium-high power observing on most telescopes. This eyepiece offers a magnification of 101x on an ETX90 or 161x on a 2000mm focal length telescope like the LX90.
4,Works like a charm,"I have a Celestron First Scope and as many reviewers of that point out, its included eyepieces are rubbish. This was a nice, affordable upgrade. The night it came in I quickly found 2 globular clusters and could actually make out Saturn, which was just about impossible before. I don't know enough about eyepieces to tell you if this is the latest and greatest, but it works perfectly for what I needed."
1,RIDDLE OF THE PARTIALLY TRUE might be a better title.,"I am suspicious (and so should you be, too) of the truthfulness of an article or book when even one fact is wrong. If the author makes one error, there may be others, just as when someone lies to you once, there is no way to know when they might lie again, so everything they say must thereafter be taken with a grain of salt. Because the author of Riddle of the Bones gets so much wrong with regard to the religion of Asatru and comes across as noticeably biased against Asatru (a subject which I have had occassion to study), I have no reason to believe the rest of the book is any more accurate and truthful than those inaccurate Asatru parts. Read it if you like, but take it with a grain of salt. Or read it but also read the other side of the story ............................... then decide for yourself, which is always the best way to decide things anyway."
5,"Casually, INCREDIBLE!","I didn't even intend to get this one (I mixed up my order and thought I was getting a new copy of ""Your Sounds"") and it has turned out to be one of my all-time favorite records! Buy liberally and share."
2,Not what I expected,I ordered 3 Christmas CDs after listening to about 50 or so excerpts on Amazon's site. I selected the 3 I thought I would really enjoy the most. I did not like any of them. A waste of money and my time. The merchandise did arrive timely and in good condition.
5,Great book for your young Garfield fan,"These are great chapter books for your early reader Garfield fan. My son loves them, I just wish there were more in the series. Unfortunately there are only four books in the series, so once they have read these four that's all there is."
1,Not book I ordered,It was not listed as a large print book. That was the second one i purchased that was not listed as large print.
5,Don't be fooled. This is a great record,"OK, I know fellow jazz heads, this is not Speak No Evil or Schizophrenia, Ju JU, Adams Apple, etc. But this CD is not ABOUT those recordings. This CD celebrates his writing for larger, post Weather Report, ensembles. Almost through composed. I'm saddened that it's not available for download. I have it on vinyl. This is a GREAT record. It definitely takes listening with new ears. It's very tight. Not a lot of room for expression of the sidemen. Not a lot of blowing. Endangered Species, Three Marias, . . . for this style of Shorter this is his great one -- much better than High Life or his more recent Alegria, as far as I'm concerned. If you want to check out the mind of Shorter as a COMPOSER where he exerts control over all aspect of the music, you must check out this CD. If you're looking for blowing and those great Blue Note sides of Wayne Shorter the player and giant COMPOSER, of his jazz classics, this is not the one for you."
4,"Great melodies, great arrangements","This album shows what Wayne Shorter can do in a through-composed setting. First, as we would expect from Wayne, the melodies are excellent. I often find myself singing them for days after listening to the album. The arrangements are also excellent. Just spend a little time listening to one part, and let the rest of it flow over you as background. Whatever instrument you choose, it will be interesting. Let the music flow over you as you dig into the various corners of the arrangement. Wayne's saxophone playing is subordinated to these arrangements, but it still has its moments of beauty. The individuality and brilliance of his rhythmic approach shines through in a few spots."
2,beautiful but monotonous,"The music here is indeed heavenly, as you would expect from a harp, yet every piece is played at the same slow pace. Found myself wanting a variety in the tempo!"
2,Decent tracks marred by abysmal mixes,"This CD is ALL wrong, as a major release. The tracks are decently selected, there's a variety between the Tribal sound, and the more Euro NRG effect, tho the selections do seem to lean on the gay side. However, this combination of styles which is woefully rare in today's dance compilations- most of which narrowly focus on only one highly specific style or scene- is positively WRECKED by the ummm, I guess we're calling that ""mixing"". Most computer literate folks could do the same with any of a number of low-budget music mixing programs. Apologies, folks, but cross fading the first and last 5 seconds of successive songs is not generally deemed ""mixing"". One thing that demonstrates a DJ's innate musicality and talent is the continuity and craftiness of his transitions, and for all the talent for music post-production that Mr. Cox may possess, he should be humiliated and ashamed to have his name associated with this wholly mediocre sell-out."
2,too commercialized!,"Good music, but this is all trance that was released over a year or so ago. I'm over ""Heaven"" and ""One more time""-- this music was last year."
4,Ooooooh! WOW!,"This CD is excellent. Some of my favorite songs of all time are on it. Songs like 'I see right through to you,' 'Resurrection,' 'I'll fly with you,' and 'Will I?' rock my world. I am a huge fan of DJ Encore with Engelina, and Ian Van Dahl. If you like the single of 'I see right through to you,' then you will love E and E's first album: 'Intuition.'"
3,Review by Lee E.,"A 2-CD set, this is vol. X in the laudable Stravinsky the Composer series cond. by Stravinsky's long-time collaborator R. Craft. CD 1 pairs Stravinsky's 1947 revision of his 1911 burlesque ballet Petroushka (the complete 4-part ballet, not the suite drawn from it) with the 1914 version of The Nightingale, his opera (in Russian, based on a tale by Hans C. Andersen) begun 1908, set aside 1909, finished 1913-14, rev. 1962. In 1917, Stravinsky wrote The Song of the Nightingale, a tone poem based on and much better known than the opera. This CD contains the complete opera (NOT the tone poem); the booklet has the libretto in Russian and English only. CD 2 is a bonus CD of excerpts from other CD's in the series. The works on CD 2 are nowhere listed with the CD itself: see above for Amazon.com's listing of these works."
5,"Thal is a premier composer, soloist and singer.","I first stumbled into Thal when I borrowed a Shrapnel CD featuring a slew of guitar heros. Thal's contribution to that album entitled ""Blue Tongue"", demonstrates his ability to generate complex, creative, and energetic arrangements and compositions. Furthermore, Thal's works are peppered with unbelievably unique and cool sounding guitar solos and vocals. Thal also has a sense of humor... I find that refreshing. Just buy the damn CD... buy all of Thal's works that you can get your hands on.. you'll be treated to many hours of intense listening pleasure. I rarely listen to anything else these days because hardly anyone comes close to matching the mad genius of Thal."
5,Yes they say the truth :),"I will not add the same thing to review this cool CD, all the previous reviews said the truth about it. All i want to say, if you can travel to the year that this album has created than this album would be a total blast to your ear. Surprisingly that this album to me is more as an introduction of Ron's amazingly capability on composing and singing. so why wait? get it and blast the freakin' CD with your stereo !"
2,NWA,"Tho the name of the band is never spelled out,does it really mean what it means ( tne n-word )s with attitude?How do U censor or xplain this ?"
2,A dissapointing book on naming,"Basically the author says that naming is serious staff, you should not do it yourself, yet you should pay me and use my services. He goes on giving examples of his work. I did not get any value out of this book."
1,Lots of fluff - no substance,"This books gives lots of examples, but does not explain why or how the names were chosen. This is NOT a good manual to help people come up with names for products or businesses."
2,"Misguided, but useful","The sidebars and the historical context of existing brand names is fantastic. The conclusions he draws in the main text are confusing at best, contradictory at worst.I don't regret having it, and it's got more naming information than any other resource I've found. However, his advice is based on very subjective conclusions and needs to be taken with gigantic grains of salt."
5,no more excuses,"I read this book years ago and find myself referring back to it in my mind and heart often. Just today I recommended as reading for a struggling mom. I have been fortunate enough to have met some of these women and their children. They were still in the process but they were on their way. It gave me permission to relax into the season and be more present for my children, God and myself. It is a long road, making art, walking with God. This book was very helpful. Some less charismatic types might not agree with all theology of the speakers, but this is not about theology, it is about walking the walk with our children."
4,Welcome Back,"From the beginning it was clear that the book was going to be the real deal.I have many books having to do with Vietnam!,some having taken me back there with every turn of a new page.This one is a good one.Someone who was helping or writing this book was surely there,feet on the ground.I say,Welcome Back to the World!!."
5,A Rumor of War,"Sometimes when you read these war books, you wonder how much embellishment there is -- how it might be enhanced, if you will. This is the real thing, it rings true. And it is written well. Bravo Zulu -- Job well done!"
5,"Emotionally Gripping, Fabulously Written","I had to read this book in my Humanities class in high school. I started reading it backstage during a performance of ""Grease"" and I loved it!! Caputo is like Vonnegut in a way; both portrayed themselves or their characters or the circumstances in a sharp, realistic fashion. Caputo didn't glorify the war or his participation in it. This started out as an assignment and turned into one of my more dog-eared paperbacks."
5,amazing work,"This is a really fantastic book. As the son of a nam vet, this work satisfied my curiosity about what it was like, but now I want to know more. The imagery is compelling, and the writing is top notch. I don't read books for leisure, but will probably read this book a dozen times."
4,Honest and engaging,"A superbly written account of Mr. Caputo's experience as one of the first Marines in Vietnam. Highly detailed and always entertaining, this is a must read for anyone interested in the Vietnam War or in the frightening effect that war can have on the individual"
2,a Farce of war,"I wouldn't bother reading another book?? by this author?? again.It was really boring,nothing magnetic about the ""facts"" of His story.Yes,I read through the end finally but really disappointed.I wasted a lot of time instead of my Bible."
1,Caputo wasn't much of a marine,"Caputo wasn't much of a marine. He started complaining about Vietnam before he arrived. Every page is filled with criticism, cynicism, griping, complaining, and self-serving tripe. He wanted to be a hero, but he didn't have what it took to be anything but a whining wimp. Certainly he writes well. But writing well and living well are entirely different. He doesn't understand honor or duty. Sure the war was politicized, but so is every war. Sure the rules of engagement were stupid, but a soldier serves. Caputo did not serve; rather he whined. Many of us who served in Vietnam believed there were many things that made no sense. But we didn't turn tail and run. We served. For those who want to understand what is was like to be a soldier in Vietnam, read ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young"" or ""Steel My Soldiers' Hearts"". If you want to know what is was like to be useless in Vietnam, read this book."
4,Not your father's Vetnam War book,"Told from the perspective of a green 2nd lietenant in the USMC this book is among the most compelling Vietnam war documentaries.The pendulum of human emotion is vividly displayed in this honest portrayal of hate, boredom, fear and despair. Caputo relates his emotions and thoughts extremely honestly and doesn't seem to be putting on airs about his time in Vietnam.The book follows his progression from gung ho patriot to pessimistic veteran during the early years of the war. His desire to lead front line troops gives way to descriptions of nights on the front lines and the hours of monotony and boredom.The honesty in this book is compelling. It is as though you are forced to experience and feel the emotions of a young man who is realizing for the first time that things in this world are not quite as rosy as they may appear from a distance. The black and white world of Americana takes on a few shades of gray in this excellent missive."
5,One of best books from the front lines ever written,"Bar nor, I have never read a more real account of war. He takes you there, to the foreign world of the front lines, he envelops you is this mystery that was Vietnam and then he shows you the things all too familiar, present in all of us, the struggle of the human spirit. The moral quandaries between right and wrong and the choices we make under duress. An enduring memoir that everyone should read, to learn about this war, all wars, and to take a look in the mirror."
5,Read it. Believe it!,"I was a REMF, but I was there. If you want to condense Phil's epic American tragedy (Dreiser ref intended) down to one sentence, it could be, ""You can get used to anything if you do it often enough.""You zippoed the whole vil? No s--t; let's get chow.When acts of depravity become as commonplace as body functions, the perpetrators' and witnesses' only coping mechanism is to accept depravity as the norm. That outlook does not change by the simple act of returning back to the world. That's why Phil had to write this book, and why you have to read it."
2,BMW Restoration Book Comment,It does not give technical hints but just a detailed and photographic description of different BMW Bike Models.
4,How to restore you BMW twin 1955 - 1985,Another very useful book with heaps of information on older model BMW bikes. Discusses strengths and weaknesses of the bikes and ways to restore them.A book I'll constantly refer to.
1,Appears to ignore actual readings in favor of simple chart,"This device gives the same reading to everyone who enters the same height and weight, regardless of their actual body composition. Interestingly, it also asks your age and gender, and completely ignores this information also. It will refuse to calculate unless you touch the ""electrodes,"" but no matter who touches the electrodes, it gives the same result. In other words, it is a simple calculator, disguised as a measuring device. If you are looking for a device that will give consistent results, then you're in luck. But if you want an actual measurement, you won't find it here."
1,Not Complete,"Very disappointing. Even though the description claims there are 45 episodes, there were in fact 47 in total. And unfortunately, the only reason I purchased this entire set was to see the two episodes which happen to be missing (Mad Dog Coll Story, Parts 1 and 2). Don't claim this is a ""complete series"" when there are in fact some episodes missing."
2,Release 'Mad Dog Coll' in A 2nd Volume,"For the many of us who own the first volume, please release a second volume containIng the rest of the series, including the omitted episodes, Mad Dog Coll, parts I and II. And it would be good to give those 2 omitted episodes to people who bought the advertised complete series, and did not get a 'complete' series."
1,NOT FOR OSX,"This item is NOT for OSX. It's windows, and only windows. I've tried three times to purchase this item. Twice from individual sellers through amazon, and the last time through amazon directly. And of course, I get to eat the shipping on the first two. The seller BREWINGTODAY was at least kind enough to spring for return shipping.Thanks amazon!"
1,poor quality,"The very first time I used the lingerie bag for my delicates in the wash, the zipper broke. When I looked closer, I saw that the metal fastener on the right side of the bag was ripped and it caught one of my delicate items. My remaining my delicate items were wrapped around the agitator of the washing machine. I am very disappointed that the lingerie bag did not protect my delicates and that it broke on its very first use."
1,Poor quality,I used the bag once and 2 holes developed along the seam allowing clothing out into the rest of the wash. Don't waste your money. This bag is a piece of junk.
4,A Great Father-son Movie,"This is a great movie for fathers and sons alike. If you like a funny family comedy with a little drama, this movie is for you. It captures the essence of the competitiveness and the fun of Boy Scouts. This is one great movie."
4,"Hard to read, hard to put down","This is a gutsy book, particularly the last third, as it chronicles with unusual personal honesty the five-year decline of the author's father from a bright and energetic person to the shell of a man sentenced to a lingering death. This book certainly makes you think about your own end. D H"
3,okay,"A little harder thank it looks. There are a couple of tiny ocean parts that will be easily lost, not sure why there were not just cut bigger. If the capitols were listed on the puzzle pieces I think the kids would be more inclined to learn them, but being on the inside they don't pay any attention to them. But my kids love map puzzles so they don't mind much. It is a good sturdy cardboard puzzle."
5,best puzzles,I had these puzzles for my kids 25 years ago...still do...they last forever. Glad to see some new ones out.
5,Too good 2 be Testament!,"This CD is a headbanger's dream come true. I couldn't believe how good it is. Usually Testament doesn't have the Pantera style vocals, but this one does. It's like a cross between Pantera and Slayer. It is unbelievably good. When I bought it i said ""C'mon it can't be this good"" but it was! That's what is so awesome about this album. It is thrashy, metally and just plain killer. BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW!"
5,Best since The Legacy . . . and maybe better . . .,"I heard ""DNR"" on a compilation cassette from a friend, and was amazed at how powerful it was . . . and how stunning the drumming was. After getting the CD a couple of days ago, I looked in the sleeve and saw Dave Lombardo's photo (Grip, Inc., Fantomas, Slayer). I knew it! That explains it! This record is the greatest work that they've done since long ago on The Legacy. And, what's more, with the addition of Lombardo's skills and aggression, Testament is propelled into some MAJOR realms of metal power. This is truly a thrash metal classic, and I would highly, HIGHLY recommend it fans of that lost style."
5,DNR,This is one of Testament's best. Only bad thing is that James Murphy wasn't able to do many solos. Lombardo has his feet back while Peterson creates the thrashing. Chuck's voice scares the devil and Steve DiGiorgio takes care of the low end like no other bassist can. Definitely worth the money. Keep up the thrash and trash the trendy bands.
2,Where have I heard this before...?,"Unbelievable. A band that is solidly routed in the old style of standard thrash music decides to regress backwards a bit on this last release. Apparently the sheer mundane boredom (and probable bad sales) that was ""Demonic"" didn't seem to upset Mr. Billy all that much. Of course, this time around, we have a who's who of the metal world... mix in James Murphy (ex-Death/Cancer/Obituary) with veterans Dave Lombardo (duh) and Steve DiGiorgio (Sadus/Death) and it is a pretty fearsome line-up. But, as luck would have it, Testament throws out the progressions in their style over the last decade or so in favor of the same old cup of watered down meade. Songs like ""Do Not Resuscitate"" which should have been called ""Please Resuscitate Our Talent"" and ""Legions Of The Dead"" will probably entertain the masses of rivetheads who can't get enough of that blotter-acid type unfiltered noise. Listen only in well lit areas... for your own sanity!"
5,Best Metal Album of the 90's,"The last metal album that was this good was Slayer's Reign in Blood, released in 1986. This album rocks that hard. Interestingly enough is that Dave Lombardo played on both. On the Gathering, Dave's drumming is superior to his work on the Slayer albums, proving that he is the dominant metal drummer. If Reign in Blood is the soundtrack to hell, The Gathering is the theme song for the seven layers of the abyss. I keep comparing this album to Reign in Blood because it is the only album that is comparable. Warning: Buy a neck brace before puting on this cd, I actually injuring my neck when I broke into an uncontollable frenzy, putting an end to any future headbanging or mosh pits."
3,A hell of alot better than the last,"Let me tell you at first I was quite hesitant about buying this album after ""Demonic"", because I hated Chuck BIlly's new ""Death Metal"" vocals. But I was pleased to see that he went more back to his old syle. This isn't as good as older ('87-90)Testament, but for '99 it's pretty damn hard. Great to see Dave Lombardo in there now. 1986 to 1990 were the best speed/thrash metal years, and that can be put in stone."
3,pretty good,"This is a pretty ok album. The only really fast song is DNR but if you like 80s style speed metal you should get this, but if your a fan of 90s hardcore metal like SOAD or SEPULTURA or something like that this might leave you dissapointed.+ the guitars on this cd arent very heavy"
3,It is.......OK...........just ok,"Well, what can I say that has not been said. I rate this album a 3 because...it is just ok. Production is muddy, can't hear each individual instrument, guitar solos are nonexistant(were is James Murphy), bass is buried in the mix and drumming rhythms are sooooooo repetitive. Don't get me wrong this album rocks but there are many much better rescent releases out there. My big disappointment is the fact that this album has a killer line up but the song writing is average. Save your money and buy the new Control Denied!"
2,Way Overrated!,"This is not the same sound as the 80's albums or 90's Souls of Black(my farvorite album of all time). This is that new, slow, lame sound that all the 80's thrash bands seem to develop in the late 90's. You know what I'm talking about. The same thing that happened to Overkill, Anthrax, and now Exodus. Why in god's name this album has so many 5 star ratings is beyond me. One dumb reviewer stated that this album is their best album since Low...What a lame statement. First of all Low sucked too. And the only thing to come out in since that album was demonic which was a miserable failure. Stick with the old stuff. This ain't it. It's not that this album is horrible, but it definately isn't in the same league as the first four albums."
3,Pretty good,"The group of musicians on this cd is good, but one should expect better. I haven't listened to all of Testament's albums yet, but i would have to say this is the worst i've heard. But then again, being able to top their albums The New Order and Practice what you Preach wouldn't be an easy task. So don't expect wicked solo's on every track. Only 3 or four have solos (if i remember correctly). So don't buy this if you are just starting your Testament collection."
2,Whats the big deal ?,"Yeah, Testament are back again. I see so many positive reviews for this album, but I did not enjoy it. I rarely listen to it and I honestly think its one of their worst. Some people dont like anything after Souls of Black because they changed, but I enjoyed Low and Demonic.... just not The Gathering. This CD will remain on the shelf collecting dust.I've been listening to Testament's new release, Live In London, and its worth every penny."
1,THIS CD BLOWS HUGE CHUNKS!!!,"I just couldn't wait to get the new Testament cd after reading the ""rave"" reviews by the other ""experts"" on the board. Being a fan of earlier Testament releases, I rushed out and bought this ""gem"". Boy, do I wish I had saved 15 bucks!!! Every damn song on this thing sounds EXACTLY the same. Dave Lombardo's ""masterful"" drumming just oozes excellence and originality. Chuck Billy's ""vocals"" are the sounds that every ear should hear. Where in the hell is James Murphy on this ""masterpiece""? As far as I heard, he had one, maybe two ""solos"". To listeners everywhere....DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE...DON'T BELIEVE OTHER REVIEWS...UNLESS YOU WANT MONOTONOUS, REPETATIVE CRAP...STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS ""GENIUS"" WORK BY TESTAMENT AS POSSIBLE!!!...AND TO TESTAMENT...PLEASE, GUYS, NO MORE ""MUSIC"" OK?...."
5,RENEWED FAITH!!!,"I was drowning in AOR nu-metal sewage only four months back when I got my very first computer and started checking out albums online. One of the first I read about was Testament's ""The Gathering."" I was supremely interested so I bought the CD and popped it in.....then I was reborn. With all the older Heavy Metal bands fading out (Megadeth, Metallica), I was sure Testament was doing the same. Not so. I have missed top-notch thrash for a long time now, having burned a scar into Megadeth's ""Rust in Peace"" and Metallica's ""Master of Puppets."" But this CD is superb. There is one lyric in particular that, when I hear it, makes me laugh with joy: ""I am not about to run away!"" That's good news. Neither is this fan. I know I am repeating other reviews when I say this, but: the drumming on this album is astounding! Excellent thrash!"
5,thiller,i think this music video was the most entertainind performanc of michael jackson's at that time i recomend it to all that like a good spooky video and michael jacksons music.
5,"A big gem, diamond in the rough just like Mike","This golden ticket of a VHS, that I found knocked me off of my feet. For any Michael Jackson fan it's a MUST HAVE!!!! I got one for my frined and I, it's only like 15 bucks. Originally coasts over 100 bucks, that's if you want the collectors edition, but I have enough Michael merchandise. The product came from a good company it was as it was listed and arrived earlier then expected, and the condition of the tape was good for it's age. If you like Michael you GOTTA get this, it's toooo precious. You won't be disapointed, I guantee it!"
2,Not that impressed,"I am not sure if it was the quality of tape or what the problem is, but the tape says to adjust your tracking which we had several times and on different machines and there was still no clear pictue. Not happy considering I bought this as a gift for my son who is fighting cancer right now. He wasn't that happy either!"
2,Doesn't circulate air,"It's good for decoration. It looks good, works quietly, and is easy to set up and install, but does not do it's job. Very little air circulation even on highest setting. Also worth noting is the bulbs can be difficult to find in your local stores, I ended up having to order them online as the fan did not come with them."
1,Do not buy this if you want air to circ!,Bought this and just installed it. Bottom line: It doesn't move air and you can't feel nothing...even when it's set to high! It looks good but that is it! I may as well just bought a cool looking light fixture cause that's all it is. I'm actually taking it down and replacing it with a real fan. Don't buy this fan unless you just love the way it looks and don't care if it cools.
4,A Major Instrument in Understanding the Your Bible,"""The Collegeville Bible Commentary"" is a must for those individuals who want to understand the scriptures that are being read and heard. With the many scripture studies now formulated in the many churches of today, the commentary unifies that understanding. One of the major problems in the early years of reading scripture was the confusion of each individuals intrepretation. The Bible Commentary, again, adds a tool to help bring unity and growth of those who thirst and are seeking God's Word for them."
2,simple,"This is not what i expected at all. it provides very simple information that a child can guess. anyhow, i will make sure next time i choose the right book. but not bad for the novice."
2,Nothing of Use for Me Here,"I am renovating a deluxe apartment in the U.S. and bought ten books for design ideas. I flipped through the 101 living rooms in this book and saw no colors, fabrics or other design elements that gave me any ideas. Everything seemed too busy by far.The problem may be me. Note that two other reviewers gave this book high marks. The British author has published many titles on home design. I recall that I had a similar problem with menus in London restaurants. I guess British food and British home design are just not my cups of tea. (I don't drink tea either.)"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I bought this camera for my daughter in the summer...it worked for about a week perfectly and then after that the pictures started to get blurry an ever since the pictures taken were a total mess!!!...i do not advise any one to purchase this camera..it is a waste of money..the videos are actually pretty good..however when u play back on the camera there is no sound..thats annoying, also the zoom function is horrible as u zoom in the opictures get blurrier and blurrier. However like isaidthis was not the case when she first got it It worked perfect in the beginning..."
5,Slow Burner,"I purchased the hardcover version of this book about 8 years ago, when i was younger. I was quite impressed with the work of HCB, but now many years later whenever i open the book, i always find something i didnt really see before. Maturity helps to appreciate the masterful decisions that HCB made in those hours of subject selection and seconds of exposure. Every viewing I realise the profoundness of the people he photographs, and the delicate and honest way in which he portrays them."
2,Terry ain't no Dr. Phil,"This book has Terry Bradshaw's Public Trademark self-depreciating humor. It tells the reader Basic Stuff and platitudes to live by - focus on the positive, etc. etc. No deep Zen here. I enjoyed it for awhile - but something became more and more amiss. To mix football metaphors, he kept piling on the dead ball fouls until my patience clock ran out. Terry whines about his 3/3 marriages and divorces. Hey! Game over! Get on with it! An especially long and vitriolic rant is rained upon Divorce Lawyers. It becomes evident that what we have here is a misogynist attempting to hide under pseudo-humor. The guy whines for a June Cleaver Stepford Wife who just happens to be SI Swimsuit Issue cover-girl material. Pass this one."
4,Bradshaw - An entertaining author,"If you like Terry Bradshaw, you'll love this book. It's as though he is spekaing to you directly with litle or no editing to make it read like a novel. It's a quick entertaining book with a lot of humor and common sense. It's worth the read."
3,Keep it Simple,"In this book, Terry Bradshaw recyles some of his stories from his book/audio ""It's only a Game."" The book is simple and repetitive but still contains some of the Bradshaw humor. It incorporates what he says when giving his motivational speeches at business functions. I enjoyed it for light recreational reading, but probably would not have purchased it if it hadn't been discounted."
5,Where Is Baby's Belly Button?,"I like how the questions are simple yet the answers interesting. Where is the baby's ____ to answer with locating it in the picture somewhere - under this, over this, etc. It makes it fun for your little one with being able to interact with the picture (like lifting the shirt or looking behind the bubbles). The cardboard book is sturdy, also."
1,"""piececitos""","It's really hard to find board books in the original Spanish, which means the majority of books available are translations that don't have the same rhyme/meter/ease of the original. Our version of this books reads ""piececitos"" for ""feet"" which is excessively awkward (less awkward would be ""piecitos"") and, according to some, incorrect. We're raising our son to be bilingual and since he gets English at school we try to exclusively speak Spanish in the home. It's hard to find culturally/linguistically accurate books in Spanish for him that aren't 1) bilingual and/or 2) sloppily translated. Bummer."
3,"Cute, but in Spanish it loses it's rhyme","My 18 month old loves to open and close the pages, but I was not a fan of the constant -ita words, for instance: donde estan los ojitos, donde estan los piecesitos, donde estan las manitas""...my son knows the word: ojo and pies and manos, but the -itas and -itos were a bit annoying."
5,Un excelente libro,"El libro es simple, pero perfecto para niños pequeños. Mi hijo lo adora. El hecho de que puede ser un poco ""interactivo"" lo hace más interesante. El lenguaje es sencillo y claro. Muy recomendable para los pequeñines."
4,"Super cute, but too many ""ito""s","I thought it was a little over done to put ""ito"" after EVERY SINGLE part of the body. I understand the diminutive is commonly used, but not THIS much. This was over-kill. of course it can be easily rectified by just taking out the ""ito"" when you read it to your kiddo though."
1,Well...,My complaint with this book is that it arrived broken. I think merchants need to double check before they send out the order. I got cash back after the complaint and the store ofered me a discount.
5,Very Pleased,"This is my first air purifier but I am very pleased even though I have nothing to compare it to.I am a smoker and my wife is not but I no longer have to open the door when I smoke I just sit near the purifier and we are both happy, lol,Also I live in Las Vegas such a dusty city in the deset and our apartment is so much cleaner now. I see the filter and have cleaned it once not because I had to just a personal preference.some may say there is noisy on high but really it is not bad, low and medium there is no sound at all. I just keep it on high because I smoke.I had a hard time choosing which model to buy but glad did not rush and picked this one. no filters to replace ionizer if I want, osilating if I want, I am very please would recommend it to anyone."
1,Presumed?,"5 years later, no higher court appeal, no credible request for a new trial, no false arrest/imprisonment/ countersuit, his own defense attorney bailed out on him. He had scratches on his hands consistant with strangling his victim who tried to pull his hands off her throat, and this book tries to make a case out of what he alledges is vital evidence? Get real, the book was about making a buck for the author, pure and simple."
1,"Garbage, Garbage, GARBAGE","It is with deep regret that I am unable to give this book zero stars. This guy gives books a bad name. Filled with recycled rumor and innuendo, one can only conclude that Dalton is trying to make a quick buck at the Rocha family's expense. The only thing worse than this collection of BS is seeing Dalton interviewed on TV. He embarrasses himself and his publisher with a complete inability to back up his theories with anything other than wild speculation.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. You'd be lining the pockets of a complete slob."
1,Ignores the obvious,"This book ignore the obvious question that should come to mind:if indeed, there was evidence that would have exonerated Scott Peterson or at least have shed reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case, why did his legal defense team not present it in court? Where were those witnesses, where was the evidence?Unlike some other defendants on death row, Scott was not represented by an incompetent, inexperienced and/or overworked public defender. His legal defense team was the best that money could buy: a renowned criminal defense lawyer (Mark Geragos) backed up by a team of top-notch attorneys, investigators, paralegals, etc etc."
1,Terrible Book!!!,"Warning! Only read this book if you are brain dead, wearing rose colored glasses and will believe anything you are told by the Peterson legal camp both former and current as well as his supporters...if this description fits, you will love this book."
3,What you didn't know,"If you have followed the case, you need to read ""Presumed Guilty."" I don't believe Scott is innocent, but I feel this book exposes areas where known facts were suppressed. I also question Geragos's reasons for trying to stop this book from being released since it helps his client. Now I wonder if Geragos did all he could."
2,Highly Improbable Theories,"Considering the massive amount of publicity that this case generated, I couldn't imagine that there was anything left for a ""new"" book to present. Sadly, there really wasn't. This book is chockful of unliklely possibilities being promoted by the defense attorneys and Scott's family. It reeks of denial and desperation."
4,Interesting Read,"I think everyone is overwhelmed during a trial by what we see and hear in the media -- it's hard to get a real sense of what the facts are --- I enjoyed this book because it set things out in a logical way that made it much easier to comprehend. I think the fact that the media blare has faded helps greatly, too. The bottom line is this: The truth is more than what the lead attorney chooses to let the jury hear, and this book is a great example of that. I still think in my heart he's guilty, but I believe that there was some reasonable doubt, in the strictest definition of the word."
1,PLEASE DONT BOTHER!!,"THIS BOOK IS FILLED WITH LIES!!! BABY CONNER WAS NOT CREMATED AND AMY ROCHA NEVER WENT OVER THE NIGHT OF THE 23RD FOR PIZZA AND TWO MOVIES! WHEN HE SAT DOWN TO WRITE THIS HOW COULD HE NOT HAVE THOUGHT TO CHECK OUT THESE ""FACTS"" HE HAS MADE HIMSELF LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT. READ SHARON'S BOOK......PLEASE"
1,This is the worst book out there,Unbelievable that a publisher would agree to print this nonsense.Don't waste your time
1,Actually - zero stars,"This is one I wish I could send back to the author and say, I don't want this on my shelf. I echo exactly what other reviewers are stating, that this is pure sensationalism. NOTHING in this book gives any reason why Scott should not be guilty. Everything is just rehashed news fodder. Nuff said."
2,Interesting...BUT,"Not very convincing. It is very hard to buy the fact that an innocent Scott Peterson would have allowed his defense to ignore so many facts, if indeed they are facts; i.e. the 6 eyewitnesses, the scream, the brown van, the other pregnant women who vanished...This book is mainly about accusing the Modesto police of misconduct. If the allegations here ARE true-then of course, it is horrifying and scary, as any one of us could be convicted if we have the misfortune of losing a spouse to murder...Also, if true, I have to trust the Supreme Court will ultimately grant a new trial. But this book does not show any facts that stand out-why aren't those witnesses available and screaming aloud still?"
1,Just out to make a Buck! Shameful!,"The only reason this book was written was to profit off the Peterson trial. The defense team knows full well that Scott Peterson is guilty. How Mark Garogos can sleep at night is beyond me. The case against Scott Peterson is rock solid and he is the text book example of a sociopath. If anyone has any doubts just read 'A Deadly Game"" and you won't have any more. The case is proven and is highly detail. THAT is the book that contains evidence the jury never heard. It is quite detailed and thoroughly investigated. He is absolutely without doubt guilty.The author knows Scott is guilty and to write this book just to make money is disgusting."
1,Did give it a chance and this book Sucks,"It sucks honestly it just does because if you have read this book you will realize there is nothing in the book. No substance. Nothing real. Only supposition. No facts. This book is just maybe this and maybe that. Why would Scott sue for this book to be stopped from being published? Why there is nothing in it, no new information, no big Scott secrets. So it leads me to believe this was a ploy to get us to buy the book. Resonable Doubt...where is the doubt? There is no new evidence. Even as far as an appeal goes, appeals aren't based on evidence not presented. Appeals are usually based on what happened in the courtroom already not new information. I'm mad that I spent my hard earn money on this. But now I will be reading Catherine Crier's book. That what I want, facts, evidence, and the truth about Scott Peterson."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!,"I cannot believe that I spent my hard earned money on this tripe. This is what Peterson wanted to sue over? Are you kidding me? Sue over what? There is nothing here. However, if you believe in wild murdering homeless people and spooky folks in Modesto scoping out pregnant woman for human sacrifice this book will probably appeal to you. It is obvious that Mr. Dalton needed to make some money after he got thrown off the Peterson case, but it seems to me there must have been a less embarrassing way to do it. This book is nothing less than offensive to all thinking people and is not worth the paper it was printed on."
3,Not what I was expecting,"The book is well written and obviously well researched. But it is almost exclusively a book that concentrates on the 'popular' British reaction to the American Civil War. Those looking for more detailed information about government actions and decisions regarding the Union Blockade, The Trent Affair and any other official reactions would do better to find something else.The book does, though, bring to light the less well known reactions of people in Britain who were affected by the Civil War economically."
4,A great come back,"so when this album came out i was excited because ive been a fan of no knife for a while and i will admit i hadn't bought one of they're cd's until now. id been one of those douchebags who just download songs. but i wanted to support them so i bought this and when it came in im happy to say it was very satisfying. although its alittle softer than my favorite album of theirs ""Fire in the City of Automatons"" it still has its great rock tracks like ""the red bedroom"" and ""permenent for now"". overall i think its a good buy but id go for Fire in the City of Automatons over Riot for Romance."
3,i guess it would be their 'bleed american',"Like the title implies, this isn't no knife's best work to date. Gone is the production of Mark Trombino (Blink 182, Jimmy Eat World, Christie Front Drive) and here is the production of Greg Wales. For the most part, 'Riot for Romance!' simply rolls and doesn't rock. The title track and 'Permanent for now' are great tunes, very remeniscent of the tracks on 'Hit Man Dreams' -- angular guitar lines, unconventional timing, basically everything one would expect from No Knife. But after the first two tracks, everything goes downhill from there. The album becomes rather boring and tedious, save the lovely instrumental 'May I call you doll?'. Gone is the inventive guitar work, replaced by standard and rather ""ho-hum"" melodies.This is by no means a bad record, but if you're interested in No Knife, go pick up the aforementioned 'Hit Man Dreams' or 'Fire in the city of Automatons'.No Knife would be well served to bring back Trombino for future endeavors."
1,Poor Lyrics - Song no challenge for her voice,"A complete disappointment. I rather expected something in the Meatloaf style. Instead, a disco music song with poor lyrics and it is not a challenge for Patti Russo's beautiful voice either."
5,Wonderful service,"This book came right away, earlier than expected, and was in good shape. The stories are wonderful, and perfect for language learners."
3,They work,"These are not the highest quality zip ties I have ever used, but when in a pinch they work fine."
3,Quatermass II - 'Long Road' (Angel Air),"Guess this is the follow-up to the self-titled Quatermass album that emerged in 1970.Heard that lp went about as quick as it came.'Long Road' is an apparent reunion of the band,with just one original member,drummer Mick Underwood.Joining up with Underwood is bassist Nick Simper(Deep Purple's original bassist)and two top session players Gary Davis and Bart Foley.'Long Road' is probably considered to be less progressive than the 1970 lp,but more basic rock&roll.Or perhaps call it low-key progressive if you like.Some of the decently penned tracks I thought were ""Good Day To Die"",the title cut ""Long Road"" and ""Daylight Robbery"".Would be good to play on some of those late night FM classic rock radio shows."
2,A comeback no one expected,"Mick Underwood created Quatermass II to cut a follow-up to the unlucky Quatermass experience, which cut only one album in 1970.But if Quatermass was a great trio of heavy prog rock, Quatermass II is a four-piece group with nothing left to say.The music is not awful, but it is surely more forgettable than the 1970 album."
3,Willie Nelson & Friends,You can't go wrong with Willie Nelson even if you try. But this compilation of him singing with other people isn't nearly as good as Half Nelson. But that is just my opinion
2,Not bitter or tasty,"The description is correct, never bitter. Not much flavor at all actually--bitter or otherwise. Like drinking colored hot water. I like Chamomile tea and will buy Celestial Seasonings in the future."
3,Costly ink ribbon,"The old NEC Pinwriters are kept in service to print average quality documents from computers with old operating systems. Technological advancements have made the old print ribbons hard to find, but that shouldn't mean that we should pay antique prices for ink."
5,"Great, durable toys!","I'm so glad we discovered the Woody Click line of toys. My kids have this toy and it has lasted four years so far and through two rambunctious boys, and still looks like new. They are very good quality, perfect size for little hands, and fun! They love that they can take some pieces apart and put them together again. Everything fits perfectly. We love simple toys that run on imagination, and would highly recommend this one."
3,Pricey for what you get but good quality,"This was given as a gift to my almost-two-year-old. We definitely had to put some of the pieces away until later. The truck parts are great and he loves the excavator. One of the pieces of plastic has broken (one of the little knobs that insert to snap things together) and that was sharp when it broke, but overall durable so far. I have no real issue with the product - but for the price I'd probably buy some Plan toys or a little train set instead. If you can find it on sale it's a nice set. I'm sure we'll grow into it as well."
5,Great Stuff,"I have to agree with the previous reviewers: this book of poems is great stuff. I am not one to normally like poetry, but I took a flier on this one just because of the great reviews. And they were dead on.But I do have to say this: if this book is even half autobiographical, I feel terribly sorry for Mr. Hawyley's family, and his in-laws (assuming he has any).All in all, a great read. I was literally laughing outloud at some of the poems. A definite book for a public-reading forum."
5,"All in favor, say bzui!","Ladies and gentlebugs, this beautiful and intricately illustrated story is a fantastic read for children and adults of all ages. Base leads us on a journey around the world and puts us in touch in nature as we read through the cycle of drought and plenty. A rare find, this book strikes a careful a balance of imagination and conservation on a level that young children can comprehend. We love this book, though its pages are a bit delicate."
4,Beautiful as Always,"The illustrations are so vivid and gorgeous in this book. Having such high expectations of Graeme Base (I'm a big fan of his work) I was a little bit disappointed with the actual content of the book. There really isn't much of a story told here, and no fabulously rythmic poetry as in a couple of his others. There are as always, hidden details that you will have to look at the book several times to find. Hidden animals in the pictures, and the illustrations around the edge of the borders, etc. Plus just the attention to detail that is his trademark. It looks great, but not much content. (Yes I realize it's supposed to be a children's book, but I have been entertained by almost all his other ones). Not one of my favorites... but pretty."
4,The Water Hole,We used this book to assist in earning a silver star in cub scouts. It did help a whole lot.
2,Preachy *and* unrealistic,"I was wowed by the cover art on this one and bought it for my young daughter not knowing that it's less a cute look at the common feeding habits of different creatures than an odd vehicle for ecological preservation. The message seems to be that if too many species drink the water, the water will go away and everyone will die. That's okay, of course, because in the end--everyone miraculously comes back!I'm a little bothered by the implication that simply *drinking* the water will dry up the planet, but I'm really peaved at the promotion of the notion that death is somehow an impermanant or fixable condition.Still, the paintings are great!"
3,Not worth the money,"This book took a long time to read, since it was exceptionally boring. Not to mention the constant typos and spelling errors all over the place (was this book even proof-read before press?? Sheesh! I eventually lost count.). The book doesn't really tell you how to start a business. All it really is a book full of the author's own photos along with countless interviews with other established photogs (mostly if not all Minneapolis-based) and some of their own photos. I read it all the way thru, hoping to find some insight on how to start my own business, but it never came. Just general things about the business itself and how people got in the photog business, and the authors own stories about hers. It seems to be more geared toward owning a studio since the author has 2 studios herself."
2,Studio Photographers ONLY,"Apparently, and according to this author, the only business you should open as a photographer is a studio. Everything else is pointless.That being the case, she should have made that clear in the title.The money I spent on this book was absolutely wasted, and I won't buy anything else without reading the reviews first.Totally useless."
4,Awesome book that gets the the good stuff!,"Great book to inspire that inner business in yourself! Most of the book is first hand stories about how to start a photography business by photographers around the U.S. Great read and really motivates you while also teaching you from those who have had the previous ""uh oh"" experiences!"
1,Not what I was looking for,Conrad's comments are completely re-inforced by my experience with this book. Oh with the addition of the fact that there are numerous spelling errors throughout.
2,How is this useful?,"I purchased this to get free shipping with another book I was ordering. This book might be helpful if you are opening a portrait studio. It might. In my opinion, it is more historical than it is a recipe for anything. This book does not relate in any way to anything I am involved with. I found it to be of no value."
5,Helpful information for budding entrepreneurs,"I have to agree, only partly, with some of the previous reviews that say the author is stating the obvious. It may be obvious to a seasoned, professional photographer who has been in business for years - but to someone just starting out, it's valuable information. She uses stories about mistakes she has made, learning the hard way, and gives advice on how to avoid making those same mistakes (e.g. the ""use tax"" flub and the tax penalties she paid for her ignorance). As she says, good photographers are not necessarily good business people. I think this book does a good job of giving prospective photography business owners a real, down-to-earth, inside look inside the life of a photographer who is in business for himself/herself. Her writing style is very enjoyable to read, too."
5,great book,came on time and was great price. we love to purchase things off amazon because now we don't have to go out in the cold.
3,Liked the book but I still think some chapters need more.,"I enjoyed this book however I think that it needed more information, especially when it comes to pricing products. I felt that the book needed more in that area. Overall it is a good read. I do think this book has great information and has enough to get started structuring your own business. So I would say for a starter guide, it's good. It answers questions that I hadn't thought of."
3,Insight into success but no concrete foundation for the beginner,This is not a soup to nuts marketing strategy for building a photo business; it is a string of what works for others.
5,Fantastic,"I love the content, I love the colloquial writing style. It's a fantastic reference and good for inspiration when you need it."
3,It's Ok...but for older kids,"Not the greatest. Has loosely based bible devotions and then completely unrelated ""facts"" at the end of each entry that have to do with science and animals- not as cohesive as I would have liked, and not as spiritual either, more of a general book on how to behave. Some of the situations mentioned are for kids a bit older, young ones will not understand."
4,Great Tool !,"My 7 year old daughter is learning a lot just from the questions it has. It's fun, as I do it with her in the mornings before she goes to school...it gives her a godly perspective and I also learn with her!"
5,Daily Devotional for Kids,"I bought this for my granddaughter and she says she reads it daily and loves it. When I reviewed it, it seemed quite appropriate and at a level of her understanding."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"Just received this book recently and I'm SO, SO, SO pleased with it. I've been looking for a way to make Jesus, God, and prayers more understandable for my 2 & 4 1/2 year old. This book is definitely ""Child friendly"". It does a wonderful job of using child-perfect language to make each topic easy for children to understand, and even help you start to discuss further thoughts and ideas. I also love that you can look up a specific devotional (ie: Don't Lie, Honor Your Parents, Be a Helper, etc.) if a specific incident arises in your day and you would like to reflect with your child.Great way to get young children interested and involved in a daily reflection and prayer!!!! Overall, just a GREAT BOOK!"
4,Pure Nostalgia!,"I grew up watching power rangers and remember this movie very well. This is from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series which was part of the classic interlinking stories (Season 1 MMPR - 7 LOST GALAXY) and is an alternate version of how the rangers got their Ninja powers(season 3). There is also a movie for season 5 (Turbo), it may be cheaper to get the double feature version which has both movies on it. The CGI doesn't look that great now but at the time it was amazing (especially compared to the series at the time) and I mean come on this movie is like 15 years old and came out before DVD was even the current standard so its bound to not look amazing on your 1080P tv screen. Bottom line those that were brought up with this generation of power rangers def need to get this, newer fans may complain about production quality though."
1,not happy,"It does not work in my region. I place it in the dvd player and it says it does not work and says ""wrong region"""
1,Horrible...,"Ordered this movie for my nephew in September and decided to wait to give it to him for Christmas. He just tried watching the dvd last week for the first time and it didn't work. We tried it in 3 different dvd players and they all said the same thing, "" NO DATA "".. the dvd was blank!!! What a scam!!! And it's too late to return it... Thanks a lot.... Do not buy!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Hmmmmm...,"This isn't a terrible album, but when you look at the work of Max's work with Sepultura, this just doesn't really hit a nerve. There are some very good tracks here, but some of the tracks are just plain awful, and Bleed would have been so much better without Fred Durst (hey I don't hate Limp Biskit, I do like a handful of songs, but Fred just doesn't belong with Soulfly) but there things do get better for Soulfly as their music gets better as the albums go on..."
1,Metal pendejo,"This is every bad stereotype of Latin Americans rolled up into one album. From the wack rapping of white wanna-be, Fred Durst, to Max shouting like a girl about ""Eye for an Eye"" this CD made me want to end my own life out of utter frustration.Can anyone explain to me what Max was thinking when he recorded this? Sounds like he had taco sauce on the brain. Stupido. Pendejo. Crap.Even Rickie Martin's record was cooler than this. You'd have to be g.y to own this album. I burned mine years ago."
2,.......,this cd is terrible there are 2 songs that i will actually listen to again first commandment and eye for an eye besides those this album is terrible. Max is a great lead singer but hes to involved w/ that tribal garbage and he cant write a good song. most of the music in general is terrible. the musicians he plays w/ are crap. Max could be better
2,NOTHING INTERESTING,I like sepultura especially their last albums and even AGAINST but I`d say that even that not loved AGAINST is better than SOULFLY. Max is feeling too bad just for now. I hope he will write something better next time
