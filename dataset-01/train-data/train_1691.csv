2,slightly disappointed,"I have seen Ms. Guzman in concert, and really enjoyed her songs and talent. Yet, I did not like this CD. The red flag was ""live in concert"" talking to the public. I just wanted to hear her sing."
5,Great for finding gas leaks.,Finds leaks that don't even show up with the soap spray method. If will find leaks that you can't even smell gas leaking from the pipe joints. Detected a leak on the connection on the flex pipe going to the dryer. Re-taped and tested again and no leaks found. Will even detect CO2 by just breathing on it.
2,Keep having to adjust it,"Once you turn this on and start looking for leaks its okay. But after you find one, you have to adjust the click rate all over again. I do not recommend this product."
5,Gas leak detector,I purchased this unit to make sure my appliances weren't leaking any gas. It works really well and is sensitive. It's so sensitive that if you place it near an open bottle of rubbing alcohol it will go off. It's worth the peace of mind knowing the appliances are hooked up correctly and not leaking any gas.
5,Works quite well,I was skeptical that this would work as well as it does. I found some gases coming from the basement which I did not expect. It also confirmed that no more gas was coming from my range.
4,Good overview,"This is a wonderful little volume for an overview. The text doesn't provide enough detail for a school project or art history buffs, but it is a great review. The book is too heavy to use as a tour book, but I bought it after our trip to Florence as a wonderful little reminder of a fascinating city. The overall size is also too small for a coffee table book."
4,Tourist Book,"Although I got this book as information towards a research paper, it definitely has material to be used, but seems to be more geared towards the tourist who is visiting Florence. A walking guide if you will. But if I ever venture over the Italy, I'll have the book and information at hand."
4,Great book,"I used this all semester in my class abroad. This book was an excellent resource at a great price! Item shipped fast and efficient, thank you so much."
1,Will not purchase again from this retailer,"I have been purchasing this exact product from my local natural food store for a couple of years. This time, I decided to go for the ""deal"" and purchase it online. The product clearly states - KEEP REFRIGERATED on the bottle. I thought it would come in a dry ice pack but it arrived in my mailbox on a warm September afternoon in a plain brown envelope. Never mind the days it was being shipped, moving from warehouse to truck, etc. This product is not effective if not kept refrigerated, which I now have proof. I guess I will have to continue to purchase from my local retailer."
2,Notice no effect...,"I've used this off and on for quite a while, but don't plan to do so in the future. Why? I can't see that I feel any differently whether I take it or not. Lots of folks swear by this stuff, which is why I tried it. But for me, no."
4,Good Product,"Works as should,very happy with results. Shipped in a temperature controlled container,very happy with deliery time. Definitely will reoreder this iem."
2,just okay,Johnny Mathis is one of my favorites but this CD really doesn't have a great selection of songs; somewhat disappointing
5,This CD is a steal!!,"I am sorry that only a few of the songs on this CD can be previewed. Trust me when I say that this is a wonderful, heartfelt album. The ones you don't get to preview are the best. ""The Lord's Prayer"", will bring you chills. No one can ever duplicate Johnny's talent with THIS song. ""Calypso Noel"", such an upbeat, fast tempoed, get you in that Christmas Spirit, song. ""Do You Hear What I Hear"" I can't even begin to describe it!! Don't pass up this chance to own one of the best Christmas CD's out there! Hopefully it will be the beginning of a new Christmas tradition in your home, like it has in ours for over 30 years. Merry Christmas! Sit back, relax and enjoy."
5,Best of breed,"The Shinn brothers are legendary in information security, so when I saw this book, I made sure to put it on the top of my airline reading list.If you ever watch someone closely that is trying to troubleshoot a computer, network, or firewall, you quickly realize fault detection and root cause determination are skills very few people have. I watch people change two things and reboot, or try the last thing they just tried again and just shake my head.The book is not just about troubleshooting, it includes setup, network theory, and proper design as well. However, chapter 4 should be required reading for anyone that is allowed near a computer with privileged access, windows or unix. If this book gets revised I would love to see the troubleshooting chapter expanded, that is critially important information."
2,Dead Links,"This book does contain a lot of good information, including a recipe for a shell script that establishes a basic firewall, and a chapter on troubleshooting. The explanations of the various parts of the script are ok, but the book is now 7 years old. Unfortunately, nearly every section in the book (including some explanations of things done in the firewall script) says ""see our website for more info."" That would be fine except the website no-longer exists, and the address now redirects to a commercial product. (which is why I'm not mentioning the site by name here)."
5,Want to know and feel rural Brazil? Read this book!,"""Journey on the Estrada Real"" is a beautiful, funny, honest and warm look at rural life in Brazil's interior state of Minas Gerais.The author takes you along as he walks the historic Estrada Real. Three hundred years after this critical colonial artery was established, it is all but forgotten now except for the historic cities strung beautifully along it's route. Cheney opens an English window into that part of the world, which is mostly unknown outside (or even inside), Brazil."
5,"Abraham Lincoln, by Carl Sandburg","This book is exceptional, providing excellent insight to all that was going on during the Civil War years and the problems Lincoln faced during his presidency. The great number of pictures add a lot to the quality of this volume."
4,Waiting for Summer's Return,Both Peter and Summer have tragic experiences they are healing from and both decide to work together for the good of Thomas Ollenburger. Peter was a wonderful example of God's love for His hurting people to Summer as she healed from the deaths of her husband and children. I enjoyed this sweet story of healing and new hope.
5,Gift yourself with this book.,"You've already read what the story is about, so I won't go into that again.This book will leave you thinking about its characters long after you turn the last page. You will be amazed at the skill of the author and the story she has crafted.Gift yourself with this book. You will not be disappointed, and you will have found a new and wonderful author to add to your collection."
5,Step back in time,"From the first page of this delightful book, I was swept back to 1894 and the windswept plains of Kansas. Sawyer does a fantastic job making the era and characters spring to life. I was engrossed in the stuggles of the characters and delighted in their triumphs. With each sentence she paints a vivid picture of this unique German setting and places you deep inside the minds of the main characters. It is easy to fall in love with the gentle giant Peter Ollenburger. And I grew with Summer through each test and victory.If you thought there wasn't a fresh twist on the prairie romance, think again. And if you love Janette Oke's books, you will be delighted with Waiting for Summer's Return."
4,Very good,"This was a very interesting book, and once it got rolling (about halfway through, after all the introduced characters finally got tied in) I could not put it down either. But at points the elaborate vocabulary got to be a ""little"" excessive. I would put the book down and still have weird words and phrases ringing in my head such as, `times lost to antiquity' `pure, subpure, impure' `imperial this and that'. But other than those things, it was a quick and enjoyable read, and I will probably hunt down the next book when it comes out."
1,This Can is a piece of low quality.,Do not waste your money on this item. I bought it and from the first time I used to irrigate the container leaked from the bottom. I had to silicone seal it to be able to use it.
2,This book totally irritated me!,"And I loved Kill and Tell. There are nine glowing reviews and I thought, I must have missed something. So, I opened the book in 3 different sections and have felt the same thing...did Cherry Adair write this? Cat and Luke, they did not ring true; the misunderstandings seemed very contrived. Sorry, I can't wait to get rid of this book. I was very disappointed."
5,Can't say enough good things about this album!,This is some of the best hard rock music EVER made! The whole album is great and you won't be able to get the songs out of your head. You will get a ton of bang for your buck by buying this one! It is well worth the price and would make an excellent addition to any hard rock music collection. It isn't often that an album comes around in which nearly EVERY song on it is above average. Such is the case with this one!
4,Quality Songs From First to Last,"Jimi Bell's seering riffs are the ""secret sauce"" that sets this CD apart. James' singing is as good as ever and the quality of the songwriting is impressive. There are not any ""duds"" on this CD. Admittedly, no track matches the magic of ""Can't Find My Way Home"", but the overall quality of the songs is consistent. The sound has an 80's Journey feel, but it is probably more comparable to an early Dokken album - melodic metal with George Lynch-ish style solos. Can't wait for the followup in 2008."
3,House of Lords-World Upside Down,"Not quite as good as the earlier albums-More comparable to the first-I missed the feel of Sahara & Demons Down-These were truly great rockers-I do enjoy hearing James Christian again-I think it lacked the true core of the earlier line-ups even though Greg Giuffria did arrange the keyboards-A reunion of the earlier line-up for a ""Greatest Hits"" or some other compilation would be a good idea..."
4,Another good HOL release,"While I don't have Power and the Myth and apparently with only 2 online reviews many of you don't either, this is a solid good rocking cd. Now with Guiffria and Lanny Cordola and the core of the band gone once again we are dealing with HOL Mark7 or 8 line-up? Nevertheless this is the James Christian Band performing under the HOL monikker. The music is very good and a more mature sound does this line up credit. Christian sounds phenomenal here as always.While Guiffria is credited with ""keyboard production"" with over 1,000 cds and still a substantial vinyl collection I don't believe I have ever seen this line used before, seems just like an excuse to have Gregg's name on the disc? All said and done this is far better than Nickelcrap or any of that other trash the radio stations play every 10 minutes so go out and get it because I doubt you will hear it on your local station."
4,An exciting and surprising story,"From the two ""Doctor Who"" books by Christopher Bulis that I have read, it seems that he is very fond of astonishing plot twists. This book contains at least four major twists that I can remember, each of them a real humdinger. It also comtains a superb characterization of the Sixth Doctor and a decent one of Peri, interesting and believable supporting characters, and a fascinating plot (concerning what appears to be a parallel version of Roman history) that manages to be educational for readers despite not literally presenting real history. Then there is the surprise old enemy: the reader gets enough clues to figure out who it is in advance, so that the revelation of the enemy's identity is a truly thrilling moment since the reader finds that his or her guess is confirmed. I highly recommend this book."
1,Only For Professional Academics,"This text does include a lot of information on the southwest, but is not organized. The text does not flow, and some ideas seem to be abruptly discontinued. Items brought up are never explored, and some items are never introduced, just thrown in. The author seems to assume that the reader already has a good basis in southwestern arch, and explains ideas accordingly.This book may be just fine for the professional in the field, but as a graduate student just being introduced to SW arch, the book was confusing and contradictory. Cordell may know what she's talking about, but is not an author."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping that Jhonen Vasquez would appeal to my dark sense of humor, but much of the humor came across as forced. I only give it two stars instead of one because I agree with Vasquez's beliefs concerning humanity's violent tendencies. However, there are plenty of other works (ex: The Lord of the Flies) that convey this very same message with skill and originality."
2,"Not bad, but not the best Vasquez book by far","Not bad, but far too preachy and annoying at times. At least the art is interesting. Later Vasquez stuff is much better. Try ""Squee"" instead of this book."
5,Hannibal Ain't Got Nothin' On This!,"This is like ""Silence of the Lambs"" merged with H. P. Lovecraft re-mixed with an acid trip. Tres' cool!"
2,Some things are best left to memories....,"I first got into this comic way back in '96 when I was a little goth teenager, and naturally I loved it, because angsty teenagers are the primary demographic for this comic. Recently I dug it out of my Comic Box and re-read it. Time has definitely not been kind. The whole 'the world doesn't understand me and everything is society's fault' attitude the book perpetuates is annoying, and reminds me why I avoid teenagers at all costs. The artwork is still engaging, and I still got a few chuckles, but a more mature outlook means I no longer relate to the whiny rants of Johnny. For adults, I'd say stick with titles like Watchmen, V For Vendetta, The Sandman or Transmetropolitan. This one's for kids."
3,"Ignore the hype, but don't ignore this.","An amusing romp with some solid artwork. Have a read of the first issue (if you can find it) before forking out on this volume. If you like it, then hell, don't let me stop you."
5,NNY,"Simply put JTHM covers a vast array of emotions and feeling that we all have from time to time Johnny just acts through with them, which can give you a sense of that same outlet Jhonen vents through johnny"
5,JTHM,"Have been staring at this product for some time since a friend let me read it. Now that I bought it, I get to share all the insane humor with my friends."
4,..JtHM..,"Well, Ive been a HUGE fan of all Jhonen's work, and I must say..this is by far his greatest achievement. I love this book, so much, i wont let my friends borrow it! Anyways, if your'e into that ""darker"" humor thing, this is for you. It's about Johnny. He's a skinny, insane, morbidly dressed youth. He's got issues, BIG ones. But somehow, anyone who reads this can relate to him in some form or another. There is lots of gore, blood, and just plain horrific brutality. Sounds splended, right? Oh,yeah..and he kills people- a lot. [This book is a collection of all 7 issues of JtHM. It explores the mind of a psycho and also somehow gives you lots of pain in your stomache after youv'e laughed so hard from it!! IT DESERVES THE 5 STARS!]"
5,One word: WOW!,"I live in Brazil,so 60% of people in Brazil never heard about him or even 'Nny!So,one beautiful day,I watched Invader Zim. I can say that I'm in love with IZ now! So,naturally,I started to look for more things made by Jhonen.I found all his comics and JTHM was, at firts,the best. I ordered it in Amazon,and when I read it I really can say that JTHM is the best comic ever!The story is great,everyone should buy it!Like I said before,I can say just TWO thing about 'Nny: OOOOOWWWWW!!! JHONEN VAZQUES ROX!"
3,For Adults Only,"Foolishly I let my 15year old son have this as a birthday gift. I'm a huge Invader Zim fan and figured that it would be along the same line. It is... but it is 100% for adults only. My son had it a week before I read it. I got about a quarter in and had to stop. It's brilliantly writen and a work of art for sure, but not for everyone.Think ""Dexter"" meets ""Saw"" meets ""Invader Zim."" All the wit of Zim plus buckets of blood, gore and adult content.Just make sure the person you buy it for is an adult. I wish it would have come with a warning! Lesson learned."
4,Interesting and Psycho!,Its a good compliation of JTHM's serial killer antics! Nice comic book format...kind of bunched together (like the words and pictures) but i think it adds to the charm!
5,I Love Johnny!!!,"Like it says in the forward, Johnny is the little monster in each of us that we deny, our animal nature, our true ID *l* More than that though, he is the saddest most neglected part within us all. He is both the person we love most and the person we cross the street to avoid.This graphic novel reminded me very much of another called 'Moonshadow' only with a lot less hope and joy *l* This boy is much sadder, We know Moonshadow had a mother who loved him, but we're pretty sure either Johnny's mother was a crackhead or was never around at all.I've got to admit, I fell in love with Johnny, and yeah, I know he's a comic book character, and that in real life he would have probably cut me to little bits, but like a lot of people I am attracted to pain in a person. So he kills a lot of people... but not without some keen introspction beforehand, and after :o), there is also another monster in the story, and well, I'm beginning to babble. Just buy a copy. You won't be sorry."
5,Johnny! It's Johnny! Bow down!,"Johnny the Homicidal Maniac is by far the best comic book ever to grace the earth. Some of the best drawn artwork I have ever seen is in this book. And so is some of the most gruesome deaths I have ever seen too. YAY! This book is the first seven or so episodes of the JTHM series. Johnny (or NNY) is introduced in the first one, duh, as he really wastes Squee's (his next door neighbor) teddy bear. Johnny lives in a small house that goes hundreds of feet under the ground, where he takes some of his victims to torture and kill them. He usually only kills the people that piss him off. Usually jocks. Once again...YAY! But, I think that in some cases, the killings are justified. Johnny has to paint a wall in blood so that a giant creature on the other side doesn't bust through and destroy the earth. Giant creatures...YAY! I recommend Johnny to anyone that enjoys nice, violent artwork and a laugh a second."
5,I rarely like bloody comics BUT I LOVED THIS,"Anyone who were to flip through a copy of this book would never see beyond the blood and gore. The eerie theme to Jhonny's experiences leads to a defining moment in the afterlife. The philosophy of this book is about as strong as the sixth sense. As i said, im not a fan of pointless violence material but this isnt pointless! The book is also horrifyingly funny. Happy noodle boy gets old after a while but will keep you laughing. Wobbly headed bob lets us witness an out of proportion character's woeful view on life. Possibly the best part of this book is the sketch area. Everybody likes to see how stories and characters formed. Its just really neat for some reason. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who can look beyond the ink."
5,much better than american psycho thats for sure...,"people misjudge johnny, yes hes insane, yes hes of a sick mind but its a book. a comic book about taking out anger on people that push your buttons. its humor... american psycho was written and the world praised it. that book had no humor in it whatsoever and it was the story of a rich little yuppy who you want dead not just because hes a mass murderer but because your tired of hearing him talk and rattle on. hes anoying. the book ""american psycho was a waist of paper and i dont know how it got published. johnny is just, i dunno, sick twisted and all together funny..."
4,Still good....,"I used to read these comics in High School and I thought that they were amazing. The material is still pretty good years later. The only part that I don't care for as much any more is the Happy Noodle Boy comic sections... maybe I just grew out of them, but the randomness just doesn't work for me. You could miss entire frames and not miss anything from the story of the comic (if there happens to be one). All of the gore is just as brutal as I remembered it and still amuses my sick sense of humor. One thing that I did find annoying with the book, however, is that there is SO much unused space on some of the pages. I wish that they would have used the extra space to expand the frames instead of just leaving these ginormous white blocks on the top and bottom of the pages. Over all, it's a good book and I'd recommend it to any friend with a special sense of humor. ;)"
5,JOHNNY!,"This has been, and will always be one of my favorite comics/graphic novels. It's like National Lampoon's: Hannibal Lector."
4,good idea,"I had these when I was a little younger, and I thought that they were a great stress relief then. I thought that It'd be fine to have them now, and unfortunately, they just don't hold the same appeal they did then... That said, I got exactly what I asked for, and am very happy with the purchase."
1,Wall mounting equipment not included?!,"Being a new first-time home owner, perhaps this is typical for these types of things. But imagine my surprise, when I opened the box containing this mailbox, to find that it did not include mounting hardware. I am now back on this page, trying to figure out (1) where to buy screws (and whatever other equipment is necessary for mounting) that will definitely fit in the holes, and (2) whether the product description mentioned this lack of mounting hardware. It *does* say that the hardware is NOT included on the box it came in, so the hardware wasn't unintentionally omitted.However, I cannot see any mention of the fact this mailbox does not come with mounting hardware on the product description page, so I am leaving my first review on amazon ever to warn possible future purchasers that this mailbox doesn't come with any means to mount it to a wall. Huge bummer!"
2,No Good,"If you don't need to use the lock, it's ok...... but the lock is No Good, it's simple and easy to get into defeats the purpose of having lock mialbox sheesh waste of money."
4,very nice,"I have certainly enjoyed this item. Well constructed. Holds a magazine without folding. Safe from the weather. I did not choose to install the lock, but a good idea if you are in an area where your mail may not be safe. The price is good for this item."
5,Wall mount mailbox,"Nice mailbox. Not highly secure for problem area neighborhoods, but what is? It will handle mostly letters, and small bubble envelopes."
5,Evergain Aerobic Exerciser,"This Chi machine arrived in perfect condition, in a timely manner and has worked just fine everyday. i use it twice a day. Thank you"
4,evergain,it is a swing machine and it works great. it is a bit pricey but it does do what it says it will
5,evergrain for fibro and cfs,I love my evergrain chi stress buster. I have very tight shoulders and constant neck pain. This has helped greatly. I love all the features of the machine and would highly recommend it.
4,Tragic and beautiful,"O'barr does it again. This book has it all- beautiful art and poetry (not to mention the storyline). If you loved the original crow, you'll love this. Nuff said."
1,XSite 133 Mountain Board,"#1 - It shipped with out instructions#2 - XSite doesn't have a web site (that should have been my first clue)#3 - Shoddy workmanship, I only used it once and it broke!#4 - It was difficult to assemble (that may be due to #1)#5 - One tire was wider than the rest!! (related to #3)#6 - Finally, it can't be used as advertisedBasically, I don't recommend this product, or this seller at all (no instructions, c'mon!)"
1,DISAPOINTMENT AND DISPARE,"YES, I AM STATIONED IN THE MOUNTAINS OF AFGANASTAIN.....AND ME AND MY FELLOW SOLDIERS WHO ALL LIKE TO SKATEBOARD.....THOUGHT THE MOUNTAIN BOARD WAS A GREAT IDEA....SO I ORDERED THE XSITE SPORTS PRODUCT....BECAUSE IT SAID IT WAS A GREAT CARVER.....WELL IT JUST MIGHT BE .....BUT I DIDN'T RECIEVE THE WHOLE PRODUCT....BOLTS, WASHERS....AND A ALLIGNMENT CONTROL CUPLING FOR THE FRONT AXEL WAS MISSING......SO THE BOARD WITH THE $189....PRICE TAG IS SITTING IN OR MOTOR POOL....AND I'M IN SUCH A REMOTE LOCATION....MAILING THE THING BACK IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE...CAUSE WE GET OUR MAIL BY HELACOPTER AND WE REALLY CAN'T MAIL BACK GIANT BOXES....CAUSE THE POSTAL SERIVICE DOSEN'T HAVE A MAN TO PROCESS THE MAIL ON THE CHOPPER.........SO THIS WAS MY WORST EXPERIANCE EVER WITH AMAZON......."
2,Relatively Poor,"I don't bump this on a regular, it's more like a tribute album for the West Coast. I like the first cut titled ""Shed so many tears"" and a couple of others but, that's it. Don't buy if you aren't a true ""MOBB"" fan."
5,Breaker Bar,"I bought this to replace an old Craftsman breaker bar that disappeared on me. This looks to be the exact same breaker bar, which is fantastic - that breaker bar held up to a lot of abuse, and I expect that this one will, too.And, if it doesn't hold up, it's nice to know that I can just walk into Sears with it and get a new one!"
3,"Great idea, but better for just lacing","This shoe lacing puzzle is a very cute idea, but I think it'd be better if it was left for just lacing purposes, not a puzzle. The pieces come apart and are held in by velcro. It can be a little difficult for a young child to get the piece exactly where it needs to be because of that. The lacing idea is great, but with the shoes being separate pieces, they come apart easily when a child is trying to pull the laces which can make it frustrating."
5,Beautiful,"Picked up this record years ago at a flea market sale, and pretty much wore it out. ""Love On My Mind"" is one of my all-time favorite tunes - it's the musical equivalent of sitting in a deep, dark leather chair, sipping bourbon on ice, watching the sun go down over the mountains."
5,Essential Reading,"This introductory text book is a must-have for anyone interested in the fairly specialised area of cognitive poetics, literary linguistics, or simply the reading process in general.It breaks down its topic into concept based chapters that include practical application. These chapters cover figure and ground, prototypes, deixis, cognitive grammar, scripts & schema, discourse worlds, text worlds etc.Stockwell's mapping out of the field as it is emerging is both fascinating to read and relatively easy to understand. I would recommend this to most undergraduates, as well as postgraduates who want a comprehensive introduction to the field."
4,Rival to the Raven,"Awesome plot with a very cool and much more in depth scenes and interactions between characters. A lot more Socio-economic factors are actually brought in, dealing with taxation of the empire and dealing with the populace, the order (religion) and other issues. Makes the story much more alive and gripping. The magic of the book itself is in the ascendants, elementalists all with great a destiny. the story is fluid and magical and very hard to put down. Only problem is lack of map for such a huge scope of book involving lots of travelling and military tactics.Rival to the Raven in emotion and warfare :) On a much larger scale albeit, but still, awesome!"
2,Cheap chinese print!,"My main concern about this book is that it is no value for money. Paper and printing quality is poor. Recepies are of course brilliant, and would satisfy most chefs and wannabes. But one would expect a coffeetable book like this to be sparkling with colors and brilliance. Instead it breathes a gloomy almost grey atmosphere to the reader/viewer. This is probably due to the fact that it is printed in China. It is sad that so much effort goes to waste on behalf of the publishers short sighted intentions to save money."
3,SIMPLE recipes not always good technique,"What's with this need for Keller to counter all the classic French recipes saying to use a food processor to make a crust and NOT to leave tiny pieces of butter. I believe he says this as it saves time in the kitchen rather than using the fraisage method, which gives a much more tender crust. He even admits his crust is not as tender....and it is not. I have been to the restaurant and its unbelievably expensive, $22. for a small piece of chicken with a couple potatoes. We shared a quiche and it was soggy and the crust tough. Pretty book, but these recipes are basic."
2,complicated and lack of pictures,This book is full of long complicated instructions and I don't find it particular helpful as it is short on pictures of the recipes the author puts out. Personally I didn't find many inspirational recipes out of this book. Quite expensive as well.
5,new favorite,This is getting to be my new favorite cook book. Everything I've made from the books has turned out great.
5,Very inspirational...,I work in the trade - this book is very inspirational.As with all books - use moderation in its appliance.Adopt the recepies to your own need.Be well and make food with loveT
2,bla bla,I want something thant can make me a better cook - this do not. It is a nice kind of food porn - not very helpful.
4,"Excellent, informative, beautiful cookbook","""Bouchon"" is not as good as ""The French Laundry"" cookbook, having a greater percentage of more ordinary, bistro dishes such as Nicoise salad sandwich and salad, plus what is basically the same recipe for roast chicken showing up twice. However, the preparation instructions are perfect, and Keller does a rarity here - for every technique he uses, he will tell you exactly why it is being done that way. It's little things like tossing a salad with oil before adding the acid to protect the leaves and how big pot blanching helps with colors. And on the whole, more of these recipes are available to the household cook as opposed to TFL (no stuffed pig's head here)."
5,Thank you Thomas Keller,"I've tried one of the quiches and the ""chicken jus"", the flavors are wonderful, bold and less refined as those of the ""French laundry"", as should be in bistro cooking.During the cooking I've asked myself several times - how does he know?He new exactly what texture the quiche will have, the change in the fluids level, though I used different cooking tools.Thomas Keller's directions are exact, like instructions to a successful physics experiment.It is great that a chef is so confident in his craft, that he can share all the secrets and the little details of his dishes."
4,Not just for the coffee table!,"I received this wonderful cookbook yesterday and spent two hours with it. Unlike The French Laundry cookbook, these recipes appear doable, with reasonably available ingredients. The photography and the commentary are also inspiring. If you enjoyed last year's Balthazar (as I did) you will like this even more.My only critique is the author's use of some ingredients not easily available. I understand the necessity to remain faithful to the French origins of the plat, as well as it's representation at Bouchon, but footnotes on alternative preparation would be helpful. For example, the author substitutes duck for pork in some recipes, without providing the pork alternative. I will just have to figure that out myself.Overall, I highly recommend Bouchon!"
1,Summary,I loved the game but it was not compatible with my new computer and can no longer pla it. SORRY !!!
4,"This game is NOT MAHJONG!!! But for a matching solitaire game, it is pretty good.","If you have read my other reviews, you would know that I'm trying to explain the difference between REAL 4 player mahjong (Chinese people play this) and mahjong SOLITAIRE. They are two completely different games using mahjong tiles.However, I actually like this version of the tile matching game. The classic mode is just matching tiles with layouts in the shape of the Chinese zodiac, so there are 12 of them. I like this mode the best. The garden mode is like the classic mode, but I think you can still do without the space. And the shuffle mode is challenging, and sometimes frustrating.The background music is very pleasant, the graphics are nice, and if you match 4 seasons/flowers, a beautiful wind appears.Anyway, I hope you understand that REAL 4 player mahjong is very different from tile matching solitaire."
5,Poco's Finest,"The second of Poco's albums and the first with Timothy B. Schmit. The harmony from all members is incredible and blended. The guitar work of Jim Messina is as should be, very placed. Timothy B. Schmit's bass work is right in the pocket and his harmony has never been matched by any in my view. Richie's writing and take charge vocals lead the band through some very tight songs both country and country rock. I had the pleasure of seeing them in concert right after the release of this album and the song (Nobody's Fool/ El Tonto De Nadie, Regresa) was done in it entirety, with a masterful drum solo by George Grantham. Every sound is duplicated by Rusty Young on his amazing pedal steel guitar played through Hammond organ leslie speakers. His sound on the pedal steel has never been done before, sounding sometime as an organ and then hitting such high notes and turning it into a trumpet. To me this is Poco's finest album in both rock and country. A must for all Poco fans."
4,wrong album,"The reviews on this are talking about a different album, the second one. This is a live album, totaly different."
4,Poco rocks,Tonto de Nadie is one of the best songs ever from the 1970s. It is rarely heard on Album Oriented Rock stations which is a very rare format.
2,"Good information for beginners, photography just ok",This book has good info for beginners. The photography is just mediocre though. I woudl have preferred more inspirational and dynamic photographs in this book
3,"Good information, but outdated photos",Good book. I was hoping for more current photos and more step-by-step tips on building (posing) families and large groups.
5,Great Help,I used this book for ideas when I shot my first family portrait as a professional. He helped with the dogs in the group.
4,Good reading if your inexperience,"This book is very quick reading, but I expected more details on lighting techniques.It does provide a reasonable amount of information on posing groups which I thought was very beneficial.I think it's worth the cost, but just barely!"
5,Excellent reference!,"This book makes it very simple (comparatively) to understand how to place subjects, how to light them and how to take the pictures! The photos included are great, too, to give ideas of what is being discussed."
3,A little dated. Good photo examples. Needs graphics,"There are times the author is explaining a concept and there is a photo on that page that has nothing to do with the subject. He explains some concepts that could really use a visual graphic. The few graphics he does has, he borrowed. From memory, I think they are from Norman Phillips.Based upon that, it seems quickly thrown together with what he had instead of more polished and planned out.As with any subjective art, in my opinion at least, some of the images he uses and praises, I would never even show as a proof, let alone a finished portrait. Most of them I love. I do not want to be too negative. I mostly like the book and I am glad to have it. I just can see it being so much more.Maybe it is a good time to update it :)"
1,Great idea - very poor quality,"Bought one of these for my parakeet - first one I got was defective, didnt work, so I sent it back. The replacement worked at the beginning and my parakeet LOVED it, but then 1 month later, it stopped working. I decided to buy a second one (third mirror mate so far) and again it didnt work so I exchanged it for one that did work - you guessed it, this time 2 months later, dead again. Its too bad the recording system is of such poor quality because birds love it, but 4 defective mirror mates out of 4 is more than a coincidence. I hope they come out w either a better quality product or the competition comes up w one that actually works. At $18 a pop and returns and mailing charges, Im out $45 bucks so far and none work. Very frustrated!! - do yourself a favor and wait for mirror mate II or a knock off that works - the current one SUCKS!!"
4,Odd collection of songs...,"...with some real gems. My favs: Jettsett Traveler (classic timeless rock!); Telepathic Waves (tight!). Nice guitar crunching, vocal harmonizing, drum smashing... a couple of really odd songs... overall very good!"
4,more like a 4.5,"their debut, very punky and in stark contrast to their beatlesesque follow-up, quiet vibration land. has some great, anthemic moments. the vocals are crystal clear and have a cutting strength. but it's the wild keith moon drumming that really drives the songs from beginning to end.contains a notable (and epic) cover of the flaming lips' ""slow nerve action""."
1,Even Pavement can't save this one,"The associations with pavement may help oranger gain some credibility but it doesn't make the record any good. They're just a boring rock band, plain and simple. We keep hearing about psycheldia, please, go buy an OTC record. They're nothing more than a thin version of Overwhelming Colorfast, and that's never been cool. Mr. Stairs may dig 'em, but word on the street is that the ONE who really counts doesn't think too highly of them. Did you hear that kids, Malkmus is not a fan. Take his lead and throw this one in the dumper."
3,Light Weight,The coat is not a heavy winter coat and will not keep you warm in really cold weather. There is nothing wrong with the coat but it is better for chilly days but not cold days.
2,Genie Lamp,This item broke within the first 5 minutes that we used it. It was expensive for the material it was made of & certainly not worth $6.
4,Great replica of the Genie lamp from Aladdin,"We got this lamp for our daughter's Jasmine 4th Birthday Party. I love how it is exactly the lamp from the movie Aladdin. It is plastic and is lightweight. It makes a great toy to go along with the Aladdin toys we have. It looked great on display at her party along with chocolate coins, bangles, plastic rings and other treasure looking items we had out. Our table looked like the cave of wonders. It was awesome! The only reason why I don't give this item 5 stars is because I was actually hoping the lid was attached, but it's not and there's a little tiny pin that goes through the lid and attaches it onto the lamp. This pin doesn't stay in and so after having the lamp for only a day, the pin is already lost and so now the lid wont stay on. I hoped it was just a solid lamp because it would be less little toys I'd have to pick up all the time and that way it wouldn't get lost from the lamp... O well. the kids still love it."
2,you get what u paid,"it arrived broken where the top connects with the lamp. Did not want to complain. You can not tell when its closed but still :(Very important, the package says :""This is not a toy, only for decoration"". I got it for my 2 year old who fell inlove but as my husbands says it looks nice from the distance, but in your hand, its cheap plastic colored with who knows is it safe paint. Its made as original lamp from the books but think twice is it safe since it says its not a toy."
5,Thanks,"Thank you so much. Product was just what I needed, and the transaction was problem and worry free. Thanks again!"
1,Expired! Old Packaging!,I got this product today and had a question so I called the number listed on the packaging. The company that I contacted was Virbac. They said they sold that product line years ago to Sergants. I called them and they said that the product I have is very old so I ended up returning it to Amazon. If your package has Virbac anywhere on the packaging it is old and might not be viable anymore.
3,"Highly addictive, but not enough of it.","It doesn't make much use of the touch-screen feature of the DS but the dual-screen fits perfect for the tall nature of a pinball table (though there is annoying unseen space between them).I've never played any of the other Metroid games but I do know that the main character can turn into a ball. You play that ball in this game (or just control the flippers that move it) and the tables are brilliantly done and are full of wild features. However, there are only 2 main tables, with a couple of extra bonus tables. Which is a bit of a let down since they could have crammed loads of crazy environments on there but we only get 2.Yes the game is very, very addictive but since it's so short it will only have a limited lifespan. Pick it up cheap.Graphics A-Sound BGameplay BLasting Appeal C"
4,"Fun, but hard.","I loved this game from the start, but I was never able to get past the first two tables. It might be just a touch on the hard side."
3,Too complicated,"Metroid Pinball is a well executed game with smooth play and good graphics. But it is just too complicated for a pinball game. There are too many non pinball modes that had me reaching for the manual to figure out what to do. I would rather they give us more table layouts than just the 2 in the game. In my opinion, portable games should be simple and easy to pick up. This game was by no means simple."
2,WHY ARE THERE SO MANY THINGS WRONG?????????,"What is wrong? I don't like the Metroid Mania mode because:1. The ball easily is lost because the ball can quickly bounce.2. They take away health lives, and you have to use a bomb.3. They get in the way.I don't like Triclop Terror because:1. Balls bounce off quickly easily.2. They try to send the ball down the ""drain"".3. They get in the way.I don't like Phazon Multiball because:1. It is hard.2. One ball lost, all phazons gone.I don't like Pirate Frigades because:1. It is hard.2. Everything is harder then Tallon Overworld.I don't like wireless connection because it can say ""YOU LOSE""."
2,Holy crap are you guys serious?,"4 star rating overall? Get off the pipe dudes!I know the only reason you bought this was for the Rumble Pak, what a rip, Nintendo better start letting you buy that thing seperatly from this game!If I want to play Pinball, I'll go to an arcade, god...2 stars for the rumble pak0 for the game"
5,Orgeat,Product was used in a drink recipe and unavailable locally. The price was right and the service was fast and efficient.
5,Sly & The Family Stone at their peak!,I've been a long time Sly & The Family Stone fan. This Album is one of those albums that if I were stranded on an island it would have to be in my survival pack. It's a shame the young kids don't recognize the genious that Sly is.
5,classic album,the musical stew of Sly and the Family Stone forever changed the sound and landscape of music as we all know it. this album in particular is almost at a greatest hits level with so many song that not only hold up but also show the depth of the album. the songwriting and musical connection is all on the same page. Sly Stone is that rare burst of energy that stayed ahead of the curve.
4,Eclectic-o-funk,"Inspiring rock-funk rarely deteriorates into extended-jamland, instead winding tight layers of gospel-thrust into their own special brand of righteous rock and roll."
5,Infectious Groove.,"So many great reviews of Sly and the Family Stone's ""Stand"" already exist. Do yourself a great favor and get this CD quick. It is Sly's best work and all the songs are groovin'. You will feel yourself dancing to this music and will want to play the album all the time. It never leaves my carousel. Enjoy"
3,More for reptiles,"I purchased this for my parrot's cage as it said it would be appropriate for birds, but is probably more appropriate for reptiles. The grapevine received came with a hole in the base so a screw/bolt/nut attachment could not be added to attach to the side of his cage. I placed the grapevine in the bottom of his cage and he uses it as a step to get to his main perch. The grapevine has multiple size branches which is good for a parrot's foot, but it also has many splits so you need to make sure your parrot's claws do not get caught. I have not had any trouble washing the grapevine as it comes clean with soap and a bristle brush."
1,HEAVEN DON'T UNDESTAND...AND ME NEITHER.,"C'mon..... This is the worst cd ever. Silly,weaks and sissy sounds and voices. The rhythm maybe is no so bad after all, but is clear they wanted to be the next Pet Shop boys (?)...Ok, but here no everything is crap.i can say "" Tu sigue Así"", ""Lo Tengo que dejar"" and ""El cielo No Entiende"" are ok songs. the rest...shhht..."
1,"Groupie bla, bla stuff..... Carlos ain't here!","We are not even sure if this book is ""truth"" or not.If you are looking to Navigate Infinity, you WILL NOT find it in this book. Yet if the 'groupie' in you has to have Carlos ""dirt"", well ... read on."
1,A huge disappointment!,"When I bought this book, I couldn't wait to get home to read it. However, it was a huge disappointment. This is a book about the author's feelings and reactions to Castaneda, rather than about the man himself."
2,"not great, but nevertheless informative.","This is not a well-written book and (no doubt) casts more light on the author than on Castaneda. That being said, for Castaneda enthusiasts, it is well worth the trudge through the text. You can read beyond Margaret Castaneda's words and intent (which is not bad) and focus on whatever area of Carlos Castenada you might like to accumulate additional information. While there is not a lot there, what does stand out is that Carlos Castanda, like M.C. Escher, Eric Satie, and a few other harbingers of modern consciousness, was able to wrestle from his life a bridge for all of us to walk upon, his heart a highway for this generation. It matters not by what legerdemain he accomplished this feat, only that he by the force of his will, he did create this window for us beyond time. Reading this book was helpful in putting to rest a number of questions that may have been floating in my mind. - Michael Erlewine, executive editor All-Music Guide"
4,Compelling insight into the background of Carlos Castaneda,"What an insight into the life and relationships of Carlos Castaneda! His ex-wife writes of the times before he became an icon of the 1960's. Was he truthful or making up his ""teachings of Don Juan?"" Or, is truth somewhere in the middle? Did Castaneda in fact study with a ""sorcerer"" and write highly embellished stories of his experiences? The latter is what this book implies (at least, as I read it.)There are many stories of Mr. & Mrs. Castaneda's relationship together. There are also stories of how he related to his son (or is it his step-son?). These are very insightful about how Carlos relates to people. In this book, that's not very well. Margaret Runyan Castaneda also does not come across as very saintly.This book is a fascinating read for anyone who revels in the information Carlos Castaneda shares in his books. It's also worthwhile reading for anyone who questions or doubts the accounts of Carlos Castaneda."
2,"Stalking,,","I have read this book but all I got was a confirmation that Carlos is a master of stalking, he played several roles and kept stalking all the time. He stalked everything,,,including his wife."
2,"Muy básico, nada innovador","No le veo nada a este libro, quizás de precio esté muy bien, pero hay mejores libros para aprender gramática. Y la gramática, aún siendo importante, no es lo esencial, lo importante es el listening y el speaking, y para eso este libro no sirve de nada."
4,It arrived on time and the state was perfect,I ordered this product for my research. I'd recommend it if the person is interested in the relationship between famly and cinema and/or television.
5,thank you mr kinsley,"david kinsley is one of our heroes. he started to write very special and beautiful books about hinduism (especially about godesses/kali) in the late sixties - and continued his interesting and fruitful journey through the fields of barely known aspects of hinduism until today. his work on the ten mahavidyas is a crowning achievement. there are virtually no books about this theme field on the market - and there are no good books about the mahavidyas at all. kinsley fills the gap (once more)... and how! bravo!! kinsleys writing style is clear as a mountain spring, he really has a capacity for explaining complex hindu ideas with the utmost clarity. a must-read."
2,"Was looking for authenticity, not a toy.",This is a flimsy toy matador's hat and nothing like the real thing. It's not even good enough for a costume. Was disappointed when I received it but kept it as it's the closest thing that I could find.
3,It looked good until examples on cd not working.,yeah i thought it was excellent until i tried out the CD and the examples didn't work or did i do something wrong. other than that this book was shipped fast and in best condition. other than that not many book would cover opengl in Python.
4,Liner,Good quality and serves well to keep floor clean for deliveriesto the homeless shelter and food bank three times a week.
3,No really outstanding songs,"Not bad music but not music worth spending the time listening to, just pretty mediocre in all respects - Heard much better on street corners - Did not care for but four songs"
3,An album that grows on you to a point,"The reason to buy this album is the last song, ""Child's Song,"" which Rush is primarily known for although he didn't write it. A simple song about growing up and leaving home, it never fails to choke me up.The album kicks off well enough with a nice song called ""Driving Wheel,"" and he does perfunctory performances of two Jackson Browne songs, but there is a hell of a lot of filler here. Still, at about ten bucks, you get your money's worth. And if you're an old hippie you will probably enjoy the nostalgia kick that this album will give you."
4,I'd say buy it..,"I've had this blender for over a year and it still is efficiently crushing up ice and frozen fruit into a very smooth and creamy smoothie. Once I left the blender on a little longer than usual and it turned itself off to prevent overheating. Thus far, I really can't complain. I also use it to puree soups, etc and it works great. I recommend it."
5,Frozen fruit + milk + this blender = smoothies every day!,"I've owned this blender for over a year now. 7 days a week, I put in some frozen fruit (bananas, apples, peaches, oranges) and a few cups of milk with some whey protein. In the summer, I add a few extra ice cubes. The blender chops everything perfectly in about 20 seconds. I've made frozen drinks, pesto, and veggie smoothies as well, but I think the frozen fruit and ice is the hardest thing to chop, yet the blender chops it perfectly.Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for this blender. It's powerful and holds up well over time. Also, the sturdy glass jar (blending pitcher?) is pretty impressive. I've dinged it against my granite countertop multiple times without as much as a chip or crack. Fantastic blender!"
1,Does not crush ice,"I purchased this blender to make smoothies/crush ice. It does not. I cannot use the blender for longer than 30 seconds before it turns itself off do to overheating no matter what setting I have it on. Crushing ice for smoothies is not possible. However, in the instructions, it clearly states that it will turn itself off if is over heats. It overheats constantly.Very disappointed."
5,Great expose of influence of far left in US,I hope millions of Americans read this great book by a fine man who was drug through the mud by the far left in US Senate and media and other leftist groups.
3,"Good stainless steel, poor rubber mat cover","THis turntable comes with a non-slip rubber mat cover which does not lie flat. Perhaps in a failed attempt to make the rubber mat flat, the manufacturer puts double-sided tape between the rubber mat and the stainless steel. Unfortunately, the double-sided tape does not stick well to the rubber, which bunches up in wrinkles, causing it to be difficult to stand up small objects on the mat without them tipping over. Even more unfortunately, if you remove the rubber mat, you have a bunch of stuck, messy, double-sided tape to clean off the stainless steel."
1,remove my previous summary,"dear AMAZON, I reviewed this book thinking it was another book. Therefore my review is totally inaccurate. Take it off.-kirin"
2,Too noisy to sleep,"We've used this cot, both with the air mattress and without, and it is so noisy! When you move while you are sleeping the material on the cot pulls against the metal frame and makes so much noise that it wakes up you and whoever is in the same room or tent with you. I suppose the cot gets the job done. You have a somewhat comfortable place to sleep. But waking up everytime you move does not make for a restful night. I'm almost tempted to write to Coleman and see if they've had similar comments about the cot."
2,UNusable!,We just got this in the mail yesterday and I am returning it today. It is so squeaky - imaging every tiny move that you make creates this crazy loud noise! I am not exaggerating - the noise is so loud. It is the material that is tied to the metal frame - there is so much tension... and it created this loud squeaky noise. Spend a little more and get something that really works.
4,Coleman overnighter spacesaver bed,"I purchased 2 of these for camping and they are so much more comfortable than any air mattress we have tried. My husband and I usually sleep on a Queen sized aerobed and since he is heavier than I am I would be way up in the air and then way down on the floor when he got up. These work perfectly for camping and give us more room in the tent. The mattress' hold the air for a long time, too."
5,A systematic hands-on career search training program,"Strongly recommended. I have purchased three career search books and this one is the definite leader. Very clear, systematic, has a large number of examples. The book has a series of exercises and leads you through a training program not only to write a focused resume, but to change your thinking and preparation. It illustrates great professional selling techniques to help you represent yourself better."
5,INSPIRATION!!!!,"My sister, Donna, of FirstWrites, printed out this story and gave it to me to read while on vacation. I found this to be a great book with a lot of mystery and suspense along with the fact that it was very well written. I couldn't put it down and there is nothing I would change. I loved her characters and the fact that she used the local Bucks County area for her inspiration."
2,HOSPITAL OVERBED/OVER BED TILT TOP TABLE COMPUTER TRAY,"I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS TABLE WOULD TILT BY PUSHING A LEVER BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE. YOU HAVE TO SET THE ANGLE THAT YOU WANT AND IT BECOMES ""FIXED"" TO CHANGE THE ANGLE YOU HAVE TO DISASSEMBLE A FEW PARTS RESET IT THEN IT BECOMES FIXED IN THE NEW POSITION. I KEEP IT AS A FLAT DESKTOP BUT THE OUTSIDE RIDGE HURTS MY ARMS. I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER JUST GETTING THE FLAT TOP AND SAVED $20 - $30."
3,Serves its purpose,"Not as high in quality as I anticipated. The lock for the tilting try isn't stong enough. Even as tight as I can get it any slight pressure causes it to tilt anyway. But, it does serve its purpose"
4,Not as sturdy as I'd hoped,"I bought this table to use as a laptop cart, so I could wheel it over my office chair. It looks great but isn't quite as sturdy as I had hoped. When I angle the table top I'm always a little worried that it won't 'stick' in place but so far it's held up, even with a heavy computer monitor on it. So far I'm pretty happy with it but do wish it was slightly more stable when it's holding something heavy."
5,Enjoyable Album,This is a good album that is enjoyable to listen to. It's well constucted and well sung.
2,Disaster,"My big problem was with the Amazon.The price was too goood to be true but I bought it anyway.When I received it it was only half the size advertised. I argued with everyone at Amazon and they keot tellimg me that I bought a 1.7 oz not a 3.4 oz. As you can see it was advertised at a 3.4 OZ. I took me over a week and finally I convinced someone (in the US)that I had documentation to prove it was advertised as 3.4 OZ. She investigated and called me back and said ""they MAY have made a mistake"" they were showing it as 1.7 OZ. Again as you can see I was asked to rate a 3.4 OZ purchase. She finally refunded my money.But the perfume seems to be very watered down. I have been using this for years and this bottle was not up to prvious standards.This was Amazon's mistake not the outside seller."
4,Excellent,"This is a high quality, beautiful wood whistle that makes an amazing, authentic Train whistle sound. It is awesome! My daughter loves it."
2,Thomas Wood Whistle,"Looks great, nice size. I purchased this train whistle to use in my classroom to stop students and get their attention. The whistle unfortunately doesn't produce a loud enough sound. Wish I could return it and try another brand to see if it produces a louder sound."
2,Barely Any Sound,"I bought this whistle for my 2 1/2 year old son. I was so excited to give it to him and decided to test the sound out beforehand. When I blew the whistle a very soft sound came out. So I decided maybe I needed to give it more force so I blew as hard as I could and it was STILL a soft sound. Now I'm wondering if my son will even be able to make any sound. I was looking for a strong train whistle sound (nothing crazy loud, just loud enough to be fun to play with). I guess my search continues...."
3,Not as expected - but still fun,"The wood whistle is covered in a Sticker. the picture in the add looked more like it was painted on. My boy loves to peel stickers off of things. The sticker wasn't put on smoothly either and has lots of bubbles and spots where i know my boy will eventually get to and peel it all off. Had i known it was just a sticker on a standard wood train whistle i would have bought the cheaper plain one and put my own stickers on it. I am keeping this one as my boy loves it.-Also note the sticker they put on it looks Nothing like the photo in this add, the trains are small and the faces aren't as big as shown."
2,Poor quality,"We love Thomas the train and always wanted a wooden train whistle. Unfortunately the Thomas images are printed on paper, which wouldn't bother me much. But we received the whistle with the paper part being completely wrinkled on two sides. For this price I would not purchase this product again."
4,Great !,"Great item, the kids loved it. I just wish the wrapper that was around it don't remove part of the Thomas sticker."
1,Barely makes a sound,I was very dissapointed in this whistle. It barely makes a sound when I blow it. In fact it is so quiet that I don't believe anyone would consider it acceptable. My two year old can only get a whisper out of it after spending a lot of time trying. It seems shoddily made as well. I'm about to buy another brand of train whistle and I hope it is better. This one is going in the trash.
1,Was I duped?,I dunno. The picture shown is not what you get (at least as of 7/16/2011). This is not the Nikon replacement hood and I guess I should have read the reviews to understand this? This is a threaded lens hood and I'm already imagining the nightmare of filter changes.
5,Former professional news and commercial photographer,This is a replacement for the factory supplied bayonet lens hood by Nikon and is an exact replacement for those of us who loose our lens hoods in field photography.The replacement is solid and reliable as the original and is a great deal from Amazon.Recommend this product to all Nikon lens users. Ensure this is the right model for your lens.
1,Good as the original.,"What's to say: It is a piece of plastic. I had originally bought one that had a rubberized and collapsable hood, but it was a piece of junk. This works very well."
4,This is the original replacement for the Nikon part.,You will get a shadow when using both the camera flash and a wide angle lens.
5,Best hood ever!,"In this old world with it's ups and it's downs it's nice to know there are lens hoods around. Made from sturdy, bounding plastic sucked from American's mighty oil fields. This bit o' tulip shape does a fine job of stopping flair. (Not the kind you create with your pixs pal!) One handy feature is a shadow cast by this sage of the sage. When viewing your snaps you can see just when you forgot to remove it. Nice.Amazon and J&R; did good getting the box to me in good order and time. When in Disneyland see a Billy show!"
3,It's sure NOT a Nikon.,"The good: It will not fall off as easy and the more expensive Nikon original equipment hood.The not so good: It is not a bayonet mount, so you have to be careful to align it correctly to prevent vignetting. BUT, even with careful alignment, it still vignettes at 18mm. This is very unfortunate.As for the onboard flash shadows, that is an issue with the original Nikon hood at wide angles as well as this one. There would be no way to design a hood to fix this issue. If flash is a must, for use with this lens you really need something other than the built in flash... it's just too close to the lens to clear the hood."
3,"Ok, but not great","There's nothing in here that isn't done better in other books. It's a bit better than reading the autodesk:maya foundation maybe, but not by much.Also, the model he makes is itself not that great, and it has very blocky arms. He also does some questionable stuff like overlap the UVs for each finger."
3,Game Artist not as informative,"I got this book after reading another 3d game character creation book. This book is for someone who has experience creating characters already.The chapters explain and take you through the process of making a game character but it isn't step by step. It looks that way but the author leaves out some steps through out the book. For example, start at point A, but skip B and C to get to D. I had to guess and study the images to see what he did to create the parts of the goat man character. That was the major problem I had! but i did learn some new things in this book.I contacted the author by e-mail, and I was shocked he responded and said something like he didn't have enough room to show every step???I recommend this book because I did learn some new thing to create parts of a character, but you need to know a few things beforehand."
4,Sony RM-VL600 Review,"This Remote works OK, but I wish it would open & close the drawer. Other wise I am satisfied with it's performance."
3,Inexpensive and reliable,"As the title says, inexpensive and has been very reliable for over six months. Easy to operate."
1,Sony Universal Review,"Bought this remote to operate my satellite TV. Apparently it might work with Direct TV but it definitely does not work with Dish TV. I tried every code and even tried to have it learn from my Dish TV remote, It does not work. Also, make sure the remote can ""see"" the box since it does work on infra red. I had to return this item in favor of a ""One For All"" universal learning remote....which does work with Dish TV."
1,An otherwise wonderful remote crippled by one significant flaw,"I gave this one star because of a significant issue that Sony needs to fix. For some reason Sony decided the only buttons that should repeat when held down are the volume up/down and the VCR rewind/forward buttons. As far as I can tell, all other buttons (particularly the up/down/left/right arrows) will NOT repeat when held down. This is a major problem if you want to scroll e.g. your satellite channel listing via the up/down buttons (or any ""learned"" buttons for that matter). This remote could also use larger buttons for guide, menu, exit, tools, and tv/video buttons which are way too small, but that's a minor gripe. Otherwise this is a really nice remote. Alas, I can only give it one star because it really doesn't come close to replacing a satellite or cable remote because of this issue. YMMV."
4,Easy and great-just one complaint,"This remote worked as advertised. I needed a learning remote to use with a new Olevia HDTV, since other remotes have no codes for it. It was easy to use the learning feature and it worked perfectly with the various features of the TV and the cable box. The only thing I had a problem with was the programming for my combination DVD/VCR unit. It learned the VCR functions, but I cannot use it for the DVD functions. I would still highly recommend this reasonable priced remote."
4,Works good.,Works good and sends strong signals so TV and devices can't miss it. Kinda not comfortable with sharp corners and edges. Try using super glue gel to mark the buttons you use most with lines on the sides for guidance in the dark. Be sure to direct a fan while it dries for a few hours as the fumes seem to mess us the electronics in past experiences. Use WD40 with Qtips on the battery tips to keep the contacts good.
4,Get help with codes for the RM-VL600,"Sony RM-VL600 8-Device Universal Learning RemoteThe list for codes included with the product is inadequate. For example there is no code at all for VIZIO TV sets though they are one of the most popular sets on the market. So you have to use the remote to remote learning method. Two problems occur: 1. The code is not learned at all, 2. The code is transmitted but causing multiple unwanted actions.Emailing Sony did not produce an answer. Calling Sony Support was not helpful either. I was ready to return the product when I found this site:http://www.remotecentral.com/cgi-bin/mboard/rc-sony/list.cgiIt helped solve my problems and now I am on my way to productively use this product that does a lot for a great price."
5,TV Remote,This was to replace the lost remote for one of our two TB's. Ir is actually more convenient (particularly the mute button) than the one that came with rhe TV.
5,I purchased 4 of them !,"I bought 4 of them and use 3.The 4th unit is a Spare (just in case).I have 1 unit at each of the two viewingpositions in the livingroom and 1 at thediningroom table.All 3 units are programmed exactly the same.They work wonderful and EZ to program toboot.ALL the functions I need for my HDTV/StereoSystem are done with this remote.The LEARNING of the remotes is what savesthe day ! Absolutely wonderful.More than pleased and simple to programand to use.Note: I DID LABEL with a magic marker,some of the UNIQUE LEARNED FUNCTIONS onour 3 remotes. No confusion now and againthey are all labelled exactly the same.The Instruction Manual is EZ to use.Very wise purchase at an affordable price.I bought all mine as ""refurbished.""They come with a Warranty so no problem.Very nice and totally satisfied."
3,Not good for Sony DAV products,"We somehow lost the remote for our Sony DAV home theater system. Rather paying $90 for a replacement remote, I thought I could get away with a Sony universal remote. Even though there are 5 or so codes for Sony DAV systems, none of them worked all that well; i.e., we get limited functionality. I am not that impressed with a Sony remote that does not do a good job with their own products. While I am generally a Sony fan, this did not meet expectations."
3,Sony RM-VL600,"I found that this remote, while good for what I want, still needs more programmable system buttons. 4 is not enough for what I wanted to do. It also is not for the technology challenged. Although I found it easy my girl friend did not. But over all it does most of what I wanted and did remove 4 remotes from the table."
5,Works wonderfully,"For the price, this is a great remote control. Does what it is supposed to, with lots of features for programming."
5,Remote control,I think you simply cannot find a better remote in this class. This is far and away another winner by Sony
1,"It's probably ok for a standard device, but...","It's probably ok for a standard device, but...I specifically bought this because I have a TV (Niko) which doesn't have any published codes and have not found any 'univeral remote' that will work with it.The problem I had with this unit is that it doesn't learn the base code (the one used to do basic operations like power on/off) from the original remote. It only learns specific keys once you have set the base code.I tried many different ways to have it discover the base code, but I never got it to work."
1,Not at all helpful,"This remote did not work with any device I tried. It won't work my Magnavox VCR/DVD with any of the Magnavox codes provided. No codes are provided for the Viore plasma TV, and the search feature came up with nothing that will work. Before buying, I would suggest contacting the manufacturer and asking whether it will actually work with your equipment because clearly ""universal"" means ""sort of""."
1,not happy,"After reading the reviews, I chose this Sony remote. It worked with my DVD player in my home office, but not my new Sylvania TV. So I decided to use it in my bedroom because it had older units. Again, it worked with the DVD player, but not my GE television. I tried all the included codes but they did not work. I then tried to scan for the code. It would change the channels and volume, but would not power the unit off. I have configured many remotes successfully, but this one is a loser."
3,Not for modern electronics,"Maybe it is my fault for not paying closer attention, but this remote is dated. It comes with buttons for VCR controls and is not made to work with DVD players. By not work I mean it doesn't have buttons you would expect for DVD controls. Sure, you can program any of the buttons to duplicate the same functionality that your current remotes can do, which works fine, but unless you have a VCR and TV I would pass on this remote."
1,Cheap piece of junk,"This has fewer controls than the controller that came with my DVR. There is no page up or down on it. There is no Yes/No buttons to answer questions like ""delete this show?"" The manual was not written well in that the sequence for programming a device was incorrect. I had to mess with it for an hour to figure out the problem. Not what I would expect from Sony. I wanted a controller that would do it all. This ain't it! There were many positive reviews leading me to think this was a great controller. A pox on your reviews."
1,Just doesn't work.,"I wanted to get an inexpensive universal remote, and everything I read rated this one as a decent purchase. Unfortunately, it's complete junk: The codes are iffy, the functionality is spotty (inexplicably, it can turn my receiver ON but not OFF), and the learning function just plain doesn't work. I followed the instructions to the letter but the remote never blinked like it was supposed to, nor did it learn any functions. The build quality is also extremely light and shoddy. A complete waste of money, and I'll be returning it immediately."
5,Very Nice Remote,I bought two of these and I am very pleased with the quality and features.Ive spent a 100 dollars for remotes that didn't do much more than these.One thing about this remote it has a very strong signal when using it so you will have no trouble using this at the other end of your house.Very easy to do macro commands.Keep the manual close by. Its easy to use but you will probably need the manual for instructions.This is by far the best remote in this price range I have ever bought.
5,Worth the low price and then some!,Finally a remote that was able to learn my Dish PVR receiver and a host of other components. I also like the ability of the remote to be programmed to a standard code and then let you additionally add other key functions trhough the learn capability. Definitely worth the money!
5,Great Remote (Make sure you are actually getting the RM-VL600),"The remote listed here is fabulous. Easy to program, intuitive. I recieved mine from PlusDig and am completely satisfied with the purchase. Item arrived and shipped super quick. I only alluded in the title of this review to make sure that you get this actual model (which has apparently been discontinued). I though I'd get it locally and went to a prominent Big Box retailer and they listed this model number as in stock on their webpage. However, the actual model in the store is this replacement (RMVLZ620) which is a re-design and a lemon in mine and several other amazon reviewer's opinion. Again the actual RM-VL600 is a dream (hence the five stars) and my buying experience has been super. Just make sure another retailer doesn't pull the switch-a-roo on you, just felt obligated to write that. 5 Stars for the listed model and Amazon is great even when dealing through other companies.Scott Grant"
4,Nice controller,This is probably the best controller for the price if you are just interested in basic controls of multiple units. I only wish it had a backlight as it is difficult to see the keys with low light.
3,Not at all good for more advanced devices...,"I bought this product based on its solid rating and excellent price. There is, however, a trade-off.1) The code for a Sony Blu-Ray player (yes, the same company that manufactures this remote) is unavailable. You can skirt this by manually ""learning"" all the DVD commands one by one.2) The deal breaker... My Samsung 55-inch LED remote has features that this remote would simply not learn, including the pivotal ""source"" command which switches the TV from HDMI1 (in my case dedicated to digital cable) to HDMI2 (for DVD). Major flaw.3) This one's rather petty. With my Samsung HDTV remote, holding down the volume up/down buttons rapidly moves the volume level. With this remote, the volume is much less responsive. You need to repeatedly tap the button to adjust the volume level, which is much slower.Lesson learned. A chimpanzee has no business driving a Porsche."
1,"Warning: Does not work with Magnavox LCD Flat Panel TV, 15MF400T/37","I have tried every possible option to program this with my Magnavox LCD Flat Panel TV, 15MF400T/37, and it does not work at all. Tried all Philips codes as well. I've contacted Sony support and they are useless as well since they keep telling me that it would work if I made the remote learn the functions from my original Magnavox remote, which I don't have...which is why I bought this one. Seems like it's a great remote for other TVs, so I will save it for the future since it's now past my 30 day return period with Amazon.Anyone have any luck with Magnavox tvs?"
1,Check to make sure that this supports all of your devices.,"I have aSony BDP-S350 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player. This Sony remote does not sync up to my Sony blue ray player. This was enough for me to return the device.Aside from that, it is a very nice remote, however I have no use for it if it does not support my Sony blu ray player."
1,Doesn't Work with All Media Components,"I was really optimistic about about this univeral remote after reading all the good reviews. However, the remote would not work with all my media components, specifically my Comcast cable-provided PVR. I could get it to power on and off, but I was unable to perform any functions relating to my recorded programs and list of scheduled recordings (e.g., couldn't schedule a recording, delete a recorded program, etc.). I thought maybe I was not programming the remote properly, so I turned to Sony support, who then confirmed for me that this remote would not work with my PVR. I was so disappointed, because it now looks like I'll have to shell out $200 for another remote."
5,better than $200 logitech!!!!,"this is the best remote ive ever owned! that includes a logitech 880. it responds (old sony remote problem) and is super easy to program and use. my wife, mother, and mother in law all can now operate my tv, dvd, and dvr system thanks to simple macros i made. another big advantage is no lcd screen burning up batteries and confusing electronically challenged relatives. this remote is not good for an entire home theater system with complicated a/v settings, but excellent for simple setups like most living and bedrooms."
2,You Get What You PAy,"I have to say that after reading previous reviews I was disappointed with this remote.While the learning function is really cool and not very difficult to learn and the price is all but unbeatable, the limited buttons and description for the buttons was truly unacceptable.How are you supposed to have a universal remote in 2008 that has less buttons than either my TV or cable box, and that doesn't even begin to discuss my surrond sound system, with its multiple settings and various components.I gave this remote a solid chance, programmed it to the max, forgot what buttons do what, relearned the same buttons over again, and spent the grueling hours training my wife. But in the end, its inability to satisfy my most basic entertainment needs leaves me wondering how previous reviewers enjoy theirs."
2,Unexpectedly poor quality from Sony,"Used for about 6 months before upgrading to Harmony. I had problems with buttons failing, devices like Vizio TV not being programmable, but the most annoying thing was how quick the numbers and letters wore off the buttons."
1,Cheap is just that,"Should have used common sense and left this thing alone. Not only would it not operate Sony components (per factory pre-sets) it would not operate any of my components at all. Yes I can read directions, but I can't make the unit work. So just try to return it....."
1,Not a Universal remote,"Ordered this to replace a lost remote for my Sharp LCD TV, but after entering the code for SHARP and checking the functions, most of them are not working, I can turn the TV on and off and change input and chanels but cannot access the menu. Cannot use the learning feature since I lost the origal remote. I tried on an LG TV and the menu works so it must be linked to the brand"
2,Doesn't work with Bose equipment,"While this is a nice universal remote, I didn't find it overly simple to program.I haven't been able to get it to work with Bose sound equipment, which is the whole reason I purchased it vs other universal remotes which only program with codes.I thought the learning capability would be able to pick up the signal, and it does not from what I can figure out. I was trying to eliminate the tiny and easily lost Bose Cinemate remote.Any suggestions?"
3,"Large, does not program panasonic VCR","I have a Panasonic VCR. The Panasonic codes will not allow the changing of channels by using the numbers (you can by the up/down buttons only) and will not program the VCR. It is easy to ""teach"" if you have the old remote. I did program the number buttons so they are usable. I guess I could spend many hours and figure out how to program the remote for VCR recording. Since Panasonic is a major brand I would have expected this functionality out of the box.The remote is large. Bigger than I expected. It is larger then Harmony remotes.I am using it with a Sony flat screen. Most of the controls are there however I needed to have it ""learn"" the wide screen adjustment.For the money (I paid $5 more at BB)it serves it's purpose. If all you need is a TV remote control get something smaller.I purchased a GE remote at Target for less and it does program a sony vcr (yes, I live in the dark ages)."
1,What a waste of $20,"I bought this remote thinking I didn't want to spend a lot of money, if it does what it says. Problem is, it doesn't. It didn't recognize my tv (lg), amp (sony), or blu-ray (lg).What a waste of money."
2,Keeps switching devices,"I thought this would be a great way to control my Sony DVD, receiver and TV. It turns out though that there are just a few basic buttons and the features keep getting mixed up -- the AMP volume slips and raises the volume on the TV, instead. The supposed macro functions don't seem to work well, if at all."
1,"""Universal?"" NOT!","I bought this based on positive reviews. It worked with none of the following: A Techniques CD player, a Sherwood receiver, and a Vizio LCD TV. When ""codes"" were lacking for my devices (the case for all three of my components), it did not ""learn"" the functions from my other remotes. A very short list of codes is provided by Sony for various products (TVs, DVD players, etc). Codes supposedly program this remote to control other devices. Even had it ""learned"" from my other remotes, the procedure is complicated and cumbersome. This is the second ""lemon"" Sony product I have had in 30 years (the last being a Sony Trinitron TV in the 70's that died in a few years), so generally I look to Sony for quality and value. This product was a complete dud and unless you are lucky enough to have products that are on their short list of ""coded"" products, you may end up with a dust collector, as I did. Caveat emptor."
2,ALMOST USELESS FOR MODERN TIMES,"this remote is almost useless to m0st people. the code set used toinput devices is very old. brands like Dell, Hp and others are notincluded, if it were not for the learning feature on this unit. the remote would be a weaste of time. The unit does not have updated codes for major manurfactures like samsung. I purchased 4 of these units, the manurfacture date was 2007. Sony is still considering a tapedeck a major component. Even with this unit being easy to program i would CHOOSE SOMETHING ELSE..."
5,"Works great, excellent price","You can't beat this learning remote for less than $20! I won't repeat the other reviews except to say that it works well for me, and has plenty of memory to learn new IR for every button in every mode.At this price, I bought a few of them and now every room has ONE remote, and they all work the same.Good show!UPDATE: In retrospect, the output is somewhat weak compared with the original remote controls. Also, it tends to repeat learned remote commands - like if you program ""fast forward"", unless you press the FF button really quick when programming it may go forward twice into ""really fast forward"" mode. Also learned keys, such as a volume control, can't be held down to repeat - they fire once per click. A previous remote I had worked more smoothly than this.At this point I would downgrade my rating to a ""3""."
5,amazing,"this universal remote does it all. it even worked on my laptop remote control. my roommates (also a learning) remote didn't work on his amplifier which we use for volume and occasionally change inputs. this universal remote was able to learn the amplifier remote buttons with ease. my only complaint is that sometimes the initial 'program code' function (set + menu) didn't work...i had to keep pressing the buttons. also, when the batteries were weak in the remote it kept switching to TV as opposed to staying on Cable. a battery level indicator would be ideal."
2,Incompatible with Samsung Home Theater HT-Z410,"It's incompatible with the Samsung HT-Z410, and it was the only reason I ordered it. Returning it. Otherwise, it was in great condition for a refurbished unit. No insult to the sender."
5,Inexpensive memory remote,Does as promised memorizes plenty & even learns macros. the seller was really fast & even sent instructions on the used/refurb item.
2,Get what you pay for,"Does not work with a DVD/VCR Combo. No code for these in the documentation, no help from sony (Shocker, i new i shouldnt have bought this one.) Everytime I buy a cheap sony product, I swear it will be my last. When will I learn?The learning feature did not work with an Infared remote, so I couldnt take the combo player and teach it. It didnt handle my older kentwood amp/receiver well either (which was also IR as well, so learning the buttons was out.)If you are looking for something basic this works ok. samsung tv worked on first code as did Sceintific Atlanta Cable box. You may have to get something trickier if you want to do some advanced stuff.Also the Instructions were a nightmare. I am a technical person and found them very aggravating. Plenty of ""see page X for this."""
2,"High hopes, but didn't work for us","We bought this item so my dad could control his JVC amplifier/receiver, Kenwood CD player, and JVC cassette tape player from one remote. But no matter which codes we tried for the CD player and cassette tape player, we could not get them to even turn on. We were finally able to control the amplifier from the ""commander"", but it would not switch to phono mode without being taught. Since it wouldn't even do all the functions of one of the old remotes, we decided to return it."
2,junk,This is a junky little remote. Spend some more money and go for something like the logitech 550.
4,excellent remote,Sony makes pretty good remotes. Feels a bit heavy and awkward in the hand but the ease of use/programming and layout of buttons are great. It works as a replacement of my TIVO remote but is a bit ackward because you have to hold the remote towards the bottom. Button presses (simulating TIVO) seem to work but often times are seen as double presses. This may have been a programming error on my part. I'll have to refine the programming a bit.
4,works great,"this product was easy to program for the TV and VCR. i had some trouble with the DVD and have yet to work that out. it is very simple to use to watch, tape, etc. recommend this--a great value."
2,Inferior to Philips and others,"While I am a huge fan of Sony's consumer electronics, especially their small, savvy ones, this remote is a loser. It's learning interface is unrelable, it is bulky and feels cheap, and it does not exhibit the same range of feature control as other, similar items. I cannot praise enough the Philips universal remotes (learning and non), especially for featuring two control pads, one for volume and channel, the second for menu surfing. A far superior series of products."
4,Excelent remote,"This is an excellent remotei have read in some reviews that up down buttons will not send signal continuosly, when you press and hold the up or down button, but its not true, in learning mode you need to hold these buttons longer on original remote and they will work as in original remotethe only reason that i give it 4 star is color, the remote that i receive is black with blue buttons."
3,Works Well,"For me, this remote was average, the learning capability is not as easy to use as advertised. That being said, the remote does learn most of the functions of many devices, and it does seem well built. I would have to say that this is one of those products that you would have to purchase to determine how well it works with your setup. My score is based on the experience I had, but by no means would I discourage someone who is looking into it as it is substantially cheaper than many of the other learning remotes out there. If you have multiple Sony electronics in your home, I suspect this remote would be an excellent solutions for remote clutter in the home."
2,Not as smart as I'd hoped,"I know this unit is well regarded but I found it did not live up to expectations. I could not get the unit to operate my Sony CD-Player at all, and the so-called learning function was also hit or miss for me with several of my components. With my Sony amp for example, it did most of the functions, but mysteriously, there were a few key functions it would not do and would not 'learn'. All of my components are major brands, many Sony, and all are pretty recently built, most less than 2 years old. I was disappointed and returned the item."
2,Would have been nice IF IT SUPPORTED DVD-VCR COMBO UNITS.,I read through the reviews and was very enthusiastic so I bought this remote. I began programming it and was very pleased with the results until I tried to get the code for my almost-new Samsung DVD-VCR combo unit. The manual had no codes at all for that category! I contacted Sony's support via Web Chat and they DO NOT support DVD-VCR combo units. BEWARE if you are purchasing this and have this need (or might in the future). It blows my mind why they don't support these. This is going back to the store and I'll switch back to the One For All brand that I have had in the past. I liked the layout and buttons a bit better on the Sony but it doesn't matter at this point. Good luck!
1,Won't work with Dish Network,"Don't know how this remote would be like to use, because it never worked. It will not work with Dish Network which is a deal breaker for us. I have another Sony remote that was half the price that works with all five devices and Dish on another floor. Worthless remote for me. Returned it."
4,Works fine,"Bought this to have a remote on my side of the bed for a Sylvania TV with a built-in VHS and DVD. Had to try a few different codes, but found one that worked ok for the TV portion. Have not really tried to set up the VHS/DVD portions, but the learning capability seems to work fine, so I know I could set it up by training it. It is a bit large (long) and tapers from bottom (thickest) to top (thinnest), but the buttons are well spaced and easy to access. One minor disappointment was that I was hoping it would have an internal ""last channel / jump / return"" switch, because the Sylvania TV does not have that capability - it may be the only TV in the universe that doesn't, so I was hoping maybe the remote could substitute. However, the remote didn't advertise that it had such a feature, so I can't fault it. Overall seems to be a good product."
5,Great little gadget!,"The learning function on this remote works well and is easy to use. I purchased an Olevia LCD-HD TV and there was no code to use with my cable remote. This remote ""learned"" the codes for the TV and the cable box so that I can use one remote."
4,Great Universal Remote,"I was looking for a new remote for my TV, as my old one was not working anymore. I saw this and decided to give it a shot. I have not been disappointed yet. It has all the same feature but more! It is a real nice Universal remote that is not too expensive."
5,"Excelent product, perfect for my old xbox","The product works perfect for my 3 devices, a LG TV, a Goldstar digital cable box and for my old xbox, now I've 3 controls in one, very cool for me."
2,Doesn't work on Sony?,"I like a lot about this remote, including the price.Using the learning function I was able to get it to do most of what I was expecting. TV, Sony CD Jukebox, Onkyo Receiver.The big drawback, is that I cant get it to work with my Sony Blu-Ray player! I tried all Sony codes listed, scanned all codes, looked for tech support on the sony page, and tried to have it learn some of the functions. Nothing worked. It seems that the Blu-ray player has some new type of code/signal- I would figure using a Sony DVD code should work- I cant imagine soemone keeping a Sony DVD player in the same setup as a Sony Blu-Ray player... Oh well- If you have a Sony Blu-Ray player and get this remote, you may be stuck using 2 remotes.. I'm looking again."
5,Best Remote Ever only $7,"Have only had this remote for three weeks, so far it is the best remote I have ever owned. Have been using the ONE for all URC 8910 and URC 8811 which are older and much heaver and use 4 AAA batteries. The SONY RM-VL600 has worked with all my old and new devices. Have an old Zenith VCR, RCA DVD, Kenwood VR616 AMP, TWC SA8300 HD/DVR and new Sharp AQUOS LC-46E77U HD TV. Have been able to learn any command I wanted to use from old remotes and the macros are also easy to setup. Grate remote. Bought it on AMAZON used from DAHMART only $7 looks new and came in a SONY box including the operating/programming instructions."
5,Great value,"Great value for the moneyPros:1) Easy to program: The learning feature takes some time, but the instructions are easy to follow.2) Macro feature is easy to use3) Power of remote: Can use remote from more than 20 feet away.4) Great value for the price.Cons:1) Buttons could be a little bigger2) Must switch from ""Cable"" to ""TV"" to use the ""Volume Control"" Buttons.3) The Macro buttons should be at the top instead of the bottom: This is a ""Nit-Pick"""
3,Could not work my DVR,"I was very excited when I purchase this remote. I am currently using 3 remote for my one tv. So, I wanted to purchase this remote so I can replace my previous three. Although, I was able to code all my components I was not able to program the remote to work all the functions of my DVR. The learn functions did everything but which was one of the most important function I wanted to be able to pull from my prerecorded list and to be able to watch my programs from the list. I even contacted sony and they could not get this function to work. I am returning this item as soon as possible."
4,Good universal learning remote,"I have had great experience programming this device from IR9703 Infrared keyboard for a computer. I have attempted to get it to recognize my Phillips DVD player, and it mostly works, except for the OK button. The OK button only works sometimes. The play button works as a substitute for traversing menus, so it is not a show stopper, but it is a pain. I also attempted to override the OK button by teaching it from another Sony universal remote, but that didn't fix the issue. The OK button works for the IR keyboard (as an enter key).Overall, the layout of the keys are logical and easy to find. The remote is easy to use, and it is reasonably easy to do what you want to do with it. Switching between controlling different devices is straightforward, and it has a nice feature of setting the volume buttons always go to the amplifier.Overall, very good experience for the last several months."
4,Sony Remote,"If you have a complex TV and sound system setup, and the patience to learn how to program it, this remote is awesome! It does everything I need it to do with the press of a button. I tried a Logitech Harmony 1000 (which comes preprogrammed) but spent more time on the phone with tech support trying to get the thing to work than I spent programming the Sony to control a Sharp Aquos, a Onkyo receiver, a TIVO HD DVR, and a Hitachi Blu-Ray DVD. And at less than 1/10th the price of Harmony 1000, the Sony is an incredible deal."
2,Disappointing....,"I purchased this remote to replace the remote on my tv (ProScan, from approximately 1990) and my two vcrs (Sonys, from the lat 80s). All had quit working, and none had replacement remotes available from the manufacturer.Well, this remote SORT of works, but not enough features to be useful. I can turn the TV and vcrs on and off, change stations, and adjust the volume. That's all. No programming features are accessible.Pretty disappointing."
1,Doesn't cover all TVs,"Be careful before you buy this that it has a code for your TV. It has no code for Norcent TVs, nor can it ""find"" one. All my other universal remotes either came with a code or found one with their search function. Also the code search function on this remote is tedious and gives no feedback, so I spent a half hour pushing channel up-power off with no results and never any feedback.I bought this remote because the mute button died on my old remote. The remote did successfully learn to mute and adjust volume up and down. But it's soooo not worth it to have a third remote just to be able to mute my TV! I tried programming it to work on my other TV of a different brand, but also an older model, and sure enough, despite having a code for that brand, it wouldn't recognize that TV either! My $5 Magnavox universal remote found it immediately.This is my first Sony electronic item and my last for sure. Definitely NOT worth the money or effort."
1,Do Not Purchase From DigiDeal,"The remote control worked great for the first 90 days. Two weeks later 2 of the buttons stopped working completely. DigiDeal told me there is nothing they can do and that it is not their problem. I was satisifed with the remote until it stopped working almost immediately after the warranty expired. Do Not purchase this remote from DigiDeal, they will not help you if the product is defective."
5,Excellent product and excellent service,This is my first review ever. The product is excellent; it's so easy to program and it works better than I expected. The service was quick and the products arrived in perfect ondition.
1,Did not fit.,Both the Amazon and Bendix's websites said this would fit a 2005 Escape with 4 disc brakes. It did not. Ended up going to NAPA and their pads fit perfectly. This is the first time I've ever had problems. I've been using Bendix ceramics on all my cars ever since they came out. I don't know what went wrong.
5,book,I am very happy with this vendor. The book was priced right and got here in a timely manner. I would order again.
5,Highly Recommended.,"Deep7 publishing took on the nearly impossible task of converting the massive Red Dwarf universe of TV and making it into a fun RPG experience. Amazingly, they pull it off nearly flawlessly.The game mechanics are designed in such a way that even a total novice can easily memorize them (unlike other, more complicated systems). This is not to say, however, that the game is overly simplistic. The depth of the game is such that experienced RP'ers will find enough material keep them engaged in the game.I've run dozens of games using just this book and have never had a bad experience. Those new to the idea of role-playing love the comic nature of the game and the simplistic game mechanics. Long-time players will love the chance to really let loose with their characters and outrageous plot.In short, buy this book. You won't regret it."
5,The Gateway RPG,"This was the first RPG I even got. I didn't get to actually play it till about 8 years after getting it though. All I did was fined out that a friend of mine was into RPGs and Red Dwarf and we created a gaming group which has since lasted ~4 years. It was the first game I DMed and Played and since then I have played Paranoia(Similar system), Spyrcraft, and of course D&D. It was a fun experience, and I am currently thinking of starting up again once our current game is done."
5,Cute and SAFE!,This pacifier chain is adorable and we get lots of questions about it. I love that it's also safe for my baby to chew on when he decided the chain is more interesting than the pacifier attached to it. Great product!
2,Bead cracked with first use,During the first use the top bead (closest to the pacifier) got a huge crack in it and will be breaking off soon. Not safe for baby. I dont think my baby even put it in his mouth. If he did it still shouldn't have cracked...he has no teeth! Returning it.
4,Durable and good looking,"I have no idea how some reviewers have had the experience of this item breaking or chipping. My son has been chowing down on it since he was 3 months old and it is still unchipped (paint and wood). Haba has very high quality products, because unlike the US the Eu has very strict guidelines on what the children's toys and items should be like. I think that maybe it was bad luck for these reviewers.It is a clip and a toy as well. My son is now 10 months old and he still plays with it."
2,Beware if your baby sucks on everything,"I loved the look, the feel, everything about this chain until this weekend. I bought at christmas for my son, he is now 4.5 months (2 months later) and teething, puts everything in his mouth and sucks on everything. Well the wetness caused the wood to crack on three beads, I noticed it in time, a small bit of pressure with my fingers and was able to break all three beads into pieces. I am so glad this didn't happen when my son was playing with it, easy to choke on these pieces. If you use this item makes sure to check often for cracks!"
2,not for a baby that chews,"This pacifier chain is great-looking, but it does not hold up to lots of chewing/sucking. My son is 4 1/2 months old and puts everything in his mouth. I checked on the chain after he chewed on it for a while and noticed that 2 beads were cracked! I ended up having to throw it out since I was afraid the beads would break and become a choking hazard."
2,So disappointed!,"My 8 month old loved this! I knew he would, that is why I was willing to spend so much money on it. Unfortunately he can easily pull the clip off and he starts to chew on the metal alligator clip part in the blink of an eye. I have had several binky clips with my kids and none came off this easy. I'm too afraid to let him use it because I'm too afraid of his tongue getting pinched by the clip. It is super cute and fun but there is a design flaw."
4,great read for an airplane ride.,"I read it on an airplane and it really helped me pass the time. The dialouge is great and the sense of brooding melancholy hard to pull off. My only critiscism, and I find this in a lot of mob fiction, when the gangsters don't quite ring true, or seem possible.[...]J.R. Locke, Author of,Possible Twenty, a Gangster Tale &Down and Out in Manhattan, a New York Tale"
3,"A hard-boiled pulp fiction page-turner, but little more","This is a ""guy's book,"" a first-person narrative by a hard-boiled, Bogart-esque Fed named Jake Kilmer as he follows a lonely and harrowing investigative pathway into the violence-spattered underworld in coastal Georgia. There are a lot of characters, a lot of dead bodies, a lot of ""regrets about the past,"" a bit of social commentary about the privileges and power of the super rich, and even a dash of post-Viet Nam syndrome insanity thrown in for good measure. It's a quick summertime read, but really has no great literary merit."
1,poor plotting & character development,"While not totally unreadable, the fact that the book is mostly filled with dialogue instead of action sequences and descriptions is, to me, a big weakness. As a consequence, characters are no more than placeholders, and there is practically no plot; just a long (and often boring) sequence of conversations."
2,Shaman's Crossing,"As the second son, Nevare is destined to be the soldier son. He accepts this fate with aplomb, doing his best at the Academy. Yet, once there, no matter how good he is, Nevarre is handicapped by his background, facing prejuidice that is impossible to overcome. Even his kindest actions have the potential for career suicide. Yet, his course was determined by his birth, and Nevarre can not be other than what he is.** Though billed as fantasy, other than being clearly set on some other world, there is really no magic to this book. The aborigine like people Nevarre encounters might have some magic, or it could be simple shamanistic superstition, much like the druids practiced once. The author has presented a highly detailed account of military training that will appeal to those who want to know more about that sort of thing. However, beyond that, there is little plotwise. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,Soldier Son trilogy,I have read the other Robin Hobb trilogy's and was looking forward to a new one. Did not like this one.
1,an actual review,"Having read this book i have no idea how it is reviewed as high as most of the reviews out there (must be employed by the book company.)Shamans crossing starts out Fantastic up till about page 80 or so, it then takes the biggest nose dive out of any books i've ever read. The main character goes from what you think is going to be a tough guy and turns into a whinning loser. He does nothing but complain throughout the whole book and made me wish he'd just get killed off like a character in one of Martins book. After reading a review on the 2nd book, it'll be more of the same so i'm not going to waste anymore time on this series."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZ,"hobb is a good writer... well, at least she used to be. this book is the most boring thing i've ever read. the main ""character"" is supid and as interseting as a brick wall.if you love a good story, good fantasy and a good robin hobb book... don't read this book.0.2 out of 5 stars."
1,Not as good as past series,"I read Robin Hobb's Ship and Tawny Man books, so I got this at the library. I read about 1/3 of the book and it just didn't grab me like her other books did. Dunno why. I was disappointed though."
4,Pleasant Surprise,After reading all of the negative reviews about this trilogy I was pleasantly surprised when I actually read it. It's not my favorite set by Robin Hobb but it is enjoyable. I remember one review mentioned that Nevarre wasn't likeable which made me nervous about reading this series. But he seemed to be a likeable and honorable enough character to me that did the best he could with what life handed him.
3,A decent series but not a great one,"Marked by its almost complete absence of physical conflict (a bizarre flaw for a sword and sorcery book and one that continues into Hobbs newer Rainwild Chronicles). The Soldier Son Trilogy is nonetheless a surprisingly good read.Taking advantage of her hard won expertise in creating a compelling first person narrative, Hobb plays to her strengths and gives us the story of the conflicted son of a successful soldier (given the title its fair to say that's not a spoiler) and his ongoing struggle to carve himself a place in the world despite opposition from mystic and mundane forces alike.All things considered, a good read but far too similar in style (and lacking the excitement of) the authors Farseer books, the Soldiers Son trilogy still remains a quality read and one thats especially recommended for those that prefer plot over action."
2,Not up to par with her previous work.,"his review is for the whole of the trilogy.I must admit that after reading the reviews here on Amazon I was worried that these books would be inferior to her earlier works.Being a fan of Hobb I did not want this to be the case.Unfortunately I found myself in agreement with many of the other people who have written reviews.This trilogy is slowly paced, I found myself missing pages just trying to find something worth reading.The writing and the characters are repetitive, the story at it's best is average the fight scense are at best c**p.For all the Hobb fans, give this trilogy a miss and wait for her next trilogy, I have heard it i to be set in Fitz's world.For those interested in reading Hobb start with Assassins Aprentice you'll be in for a hell of a ride."
4,Great Book,I picked this book up from a little shop on an Army base in Iraq and read it in about 2 days. First thing I did when I got back from overseas was to pick up the 2nd book and then I bought the 3rd as soon as it was released. Great series and the characters and civilization's Robin Hobb creates are amazing.
3,"OK, but a bit tedious","****some minor spoilers***I have enjoyed other of Ms. Hobb's trilogies, but this one leaves me flat. This 1st book is rather predictable except for the rather bizzare ""magic"" she invents for this series. I'm afraid for me there wasn't much magic in the book.The book is well crafted of course, but I really found Nevare a bit tedious and the description of his time at the Academy was the usual boarding school stuff overlaid with the rather savage ""new noble-old noble"" struggle. Perhaps the reason this story did not wear well for me was that it seemed to be rather drawn out, i.e., it was written as the 1st book in a trilogy, so the author could move s=l=o=w=l=y through Nevare's coming of age. All in all I still found the book interesting and worth reading. But then I got to the second book....which is another story."
2,Testament to her skill,"It's a testament to Robin Hobb's skill that I finished this series, even though I did not like it. I didn't like the main character or any of the supporting characters. By the time I got to the end I found that I didn't like a single character in any of the books. I found the prime plot situation of the main character actually repellant. Yet, I read them all. I had read the the Farseer and Fool and Liveship Trader series before, and very much liked them. I have not read or re-read any Robin Hobb books since finishing the Soldier's Son trilogy this March. I will probably try the Rain Wilds books later."
3,Well done,"I have to admit it was nothing like any of the other series Hobb has written, but I like that it has its own identity here with a different kind of character profile. Not everyone wants to be drowned in fantasy, just given a bit of it at a time. This would be a great starting book for someone just cominhg into fantasy."
2,A disapointment....,"Normally I love Robin Hobb's novels, and I was very excited by the prospect of a new triology.Unfortuantely this new series was just not that great. I did finish all three books, but unlike the Farseer Books that I read over and over again, these I would not read again. I admit that it's largely because I like your typical fantasy books with romantic heros and heroines, and grandesque storylines of intrigue and power struggles.These books are entirely different. Not bad, not poorly written. Just different....unfortauntely just not the kind of different I happen to like."
3,Zzzzzzzzzz.,"I am happy that this is not the first Robin Hobb book I picked up. Her other series have been a delight, but up to this point, (about 190 pages in) Shaman's Crossing has been a tedious chore to read. The characters are uninteresting and the world she is developing does not have the same flair as her other works. I want to know more about the people and their backgrounds, not because I need more description (far from it), but because I think something is missing.I am encouraged by those who say it will pick up the pace, but so far I have seen glaciers that move faster. I will finish the book hoping for a change and out of a sense of loyalty to an author who has provided me with many hours of entertainment, but if it retains the same flavor throughout, I doubt that I will read the next installment."
4,"Dry opening to the series, but characters shine","I'm a big fan of Hobb's other books, especially the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies. Like those books, Shaman's Crossing is a first person narrative, the character as an adult looking back on his experiences as a boy. The reader sees things through the boy's eyes, but with a little adult insight.It is a testament to Hobb's skill as a writer of strong characters that, from the very first page, the narrator's voice comes through as a new character. You would never mistake this character, Nevare for her other first person narrator, Fitz.The book has some slow chapters, but all-in-all it was a satisfying read, and it set up intrigue for the next books without leaving readers with a cliffhanger ending."
3,Very disappointed,"If I hadn't known this book was written by Robin, I would have put it down after the first 50 pages. I realize this is a ""set-up"" book but, for me, the intros to her other 3 series - within the first chapter and sometimes even the first few pages - I was hooked. In this book I felt you only had a good sense of the main character and the others just faded into the background. I found her characters in her other books to be far more numerous and interesting right away and the plots unfolded at a faster and much more interesting rate. I'll get the next one and hope I find it more interesting. I have all of her other books in my library and love them all. This one I'm not so sure about."
5,In-depth Characters steal the show!,"I read quite a few reviews that complained this new book was starting too slow - most of you must have already forgotten how slow the first Farseer and Tawny Man books were!! Its just Robin Hobbs style, to give lots of background detail on her main characters, which results in that there's always something for you to connect with the main character, allowing you to invest emotionally in his struggles. The climax was intense for me, and I couldn't put the book down for the last 200 pages, I had to keep reading till I finished the book. I can't wait for the second one, I'm thrilled with where Robin Hobb is taking our new hero."
4,Good for what it is,"And that is half of a book.This was a pretty decent first half of a book. Good characters, interesting/unusual plot line. However, my recommendation is to wait till the second book comes out so that you can read them back to back. Most books(in series) want to leave you ready and salivating in your need for the next book. However, this book will piss you off more than usual in cutting off the story in seemingly midstep.Still, Hobb will get my money when the next one comes out."
3,Zzzzzzzz.,"I am happy that this is not the first Robin Hobb book I picked up.

3,Ok,"The book is really good, and really hooks you. The only problem is the same as all of her other books... nothing ever good happens, everything always goes wrong and it gets old after a while"
3,Snoozer's Crossing,"There are so many wonderful possibilities in the world Ms. Hobb creates for this series, but somehow this book is a chore to read. I liked the idea of American Indian style shaman magic and the clash of cultures but I am 287 pages into the book and hardly anything has happened. She really could have used a good editor on this project. I like descriptive prose, but I don't care about reading page after page with long decriptions of things that don't relate to the main story. Maybe the trilogy should have been one book and she would not have needed so much tedious filler.I logged on to see other opinions of the book because I was about to throw it away and it looks like tossing it is a good choice. I am sorry to see an interesting world go to waste. I did enjoy the Farseer series."
2,Little to recommend here,"Shaman's Crossing is a slow read for the simple fact it is devoid of drama, action, romance or humor. I gave it two stars rather than one for the fact the author has at least went to the trouble of placing the narrative in a world that could have been interesting were there a story to tell or people to care about. I recommend reading the plot summary on wikipedia as it covers the books few highlights in a couple of paragraphs rather than almost 600 pages of useless script in the book."
2,I'll try a different Robin Hobb next,"Although I've been reading SF and fantasy for 30+ years, I hadn't ever read anything by Robin Hobb so I was looking forward to a good read. Unfortunately I picked Shaman's Crossing, which now that I have read more of the Amazon reviews I understand is not one of her best. The protagonist is overly stereotypical and although very well described is not a sympathetic character - shallow, chauvanistic, and without original thought. I managed to finish it, but I have no interest in reading the remainder of the series, instead will try another one of her series. Somehow I kept thinking of Harry Potter, and how the description of a school year could be interesting, instead of a dry and boring narrative of the absolutely forseeable food eaten, boots polished, and military hazing."
3,Shaman's Crossing,"Robin Hobb is an excellent writer. Her descriptions are well researched and bring you right into the story. She has the basis of an excellent novel, basically the American expansion into the plains in the 19th Century. The characters are realistic with major flaws of character. Unfortunately, when I read a fantasy novel I'm looking for a hero, not a flawed character who has promised to betray the nation he so fervently believes in. There wasn't anyone to root for in the book and I like to have a cheering interest. This is the first book of Ms. Hobbs that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed."
4,Slow and Steady,"I must admit that this book did frustrate me in certain places. Especially at the beginning. The main character is no FitzChivalry Farseer and perhaps it is a little unfair to expect him to be so. This book is most definitely a departure from Hobbs' previous more lively works such as the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies. She simply doesn't seem as comfortable in this world as she was in the Six Duchies. However, it could be that since this is a first novel in an unfamiliar world the author is still attempting to get her bearings.That said, I really did enjoy this work. The character of Epiny, the main characters cousin, was interesting and well written. Even the protaganist, Nevare, did seem to come more into his own by the end of the book. I am looking forward to reading the second book in this series, Forest Mage."
1,is this even a robin hobb book ??,"my dear fellow readers.i have all 9 of our fabulous writer in paper and in e-books as well. i am an avid reader. when this book came out i got it stright away. fast shipment...as i read the book i became astoished. this book is actually boring. weak, frail STRANGE carecters with no ""meat"" on them -roam this book aplenty.no serpents, no dragons, no fool/golden/or even a skilled magician no beast magic here no skill (double meaning...). just strange efany or what's here name... no magicship here...time and time again i turned the pages to find more boring un-even plot.again and again i found myself woundering if this is even a book robin hobb even looked at in her spare time.who wrote it? i can say it's not the same hobb woman...i got to page 50... and died from boredom..."
3,Dear Craig,Droll (adj)Amusingly odd or whimsically comical.That's admittedly a new direction for Hobb. Maybe I'll check this one out after all.
3,"Was about to give up, but","It suddenly got interesting. I like memoirs, I did enjoy it before, but I felt a bit like I was wasting time that could be spent on more entertaining books with less pompous ""heroes.""Yet, there I was, about to leave off, and then there was fight. And back stories came out. And I could see the set-up for more interesting and riveting interactions later in the series and was intrigued. So, for those a bit bored, stick with it until a bit past the middle to the Bessum Gord chapter. Then, it gets intriguing.Update: it got boring again and I left it 3/4 through. Somehow, it's not what I expected after Dragon Keeper and Dragon Haven. Maybe some other time when I want to be lulled to sleep..."
2,Soldiered through,"This novel (and trilogy) was painful to get through. I re-read the Liveship series after this just to make sure I enjoy the author. I do. For me, it really plodded. This is a departure from Hobb's other works an is paced much more s.l.o.w.l.y. Even knowing what I was getting into was not enough for me to enjoy this trilogy. If you are sophisticated enough to have enjoyed this, please take the high road and refrain from trolling, this is my opinion and one shared by many others."
1,What happened to Robin Hobb?,"I have read everything she wrote-- twice and could not wait to start a new book and a new series. What happened to the person who created facinating characters and interesting plots with an imagination the size of the universe??? Has she been kidnapped by aliens?The plot of this is non existent, the characters are so boring, and the hero- well I think insipid pretty much says it all. At the point in the book when I thought for a brief momnet the hero had been killed I was relieved and hoped that it meant something more interesting and alive might come along, alas it turned out to be untrue.I hope the aliens let the real Robin go so she can write books like she used to."
2,Not her best effort,"I really enjoyed all of Robin Hobbs' other books. This book, however, is a very slow read. Yes, tbe shaman twist is something different, but the vast majority of the plot has been done so very, very many times. I don't think I'll pick up the next book in the series. Too boring!"
1,Robin Hobb's worst book,"As a fan of Robin Hobb's Assassin series, and a slightly less enthusiastic fan of her other trilogies, I picked up this book expecting to at least be intrigued by her imagination. Unfortunately, what I found instead was a detailed description of a boy growing up to be a soldier with a background full of possibilities that fails to ever achieve its potential.The disappointments in this book include a less than sympathetic and rather whiny main character, only a few chapters being devoted to advancing the story while you wade through endless chapters of minute detail of military school life, and typical characterizations for all the other characters. In fact, those chapters that are devoted to the plot almost seem out of place in this book.Recently, I read ""Ender's Game"", an older sci-fi book which has all the elements of this book, but delivers much more satisfaction. If you are interested in this book, I suggest you read ""Ender's Game"" first. This one will pale in comparison."
2,Hobb can do better.,"My review is essentially the same as that of Craig Daniels. I was a huge fan of her first three trilogies and also glad that she ended them when the time was right. I started reading this new book with much anticipation and was sorely disappointed. The character development is there, and so is the plot but it's just... boring. It never picked up speed. I am still hopeful for Hobb's future books and that later additions to this series may shine, but this book was not a page-turner."
1,DO NOT READ!!,I am a fan of Mrs. Hobb and I love her work but this book is worse than bad: It's deprasingly bad.
2,A disappointing encounter...,"with an author whose work I really loved - until now. After reading the Assassin series and the Liveship series, I was truly looking forward to another Hobbs series, but this is a book to read only if you have trouble falling asleep at night. The sheer boredom will work wonders for insomnia. I almost felt like I should force myself to finish it. After all, it's Hobbs, right? Or did someone else ghost-write this one? A real disappointment that I finally gave up on before I'd gone a hudred pages."
2,Is it just me?,"I am on page 153 and am bored to death. I don't know if I want to finish it. Robin Hobb is one of my favorite authors, but this book is killing me. Maybe because it is the 1st of a trilogy? Anyway I do hope it get's better soon, or I'm going to give up."
2,Yawn,"I was forced to read Jane Austen. I suppose if Jane wrote a fantasy novel it would read like Shaman's Crossing. I made it to page 150, then came back to Amazon to check other people's experience.Look the writing is fine, but the story is really dragging along. I can't keep propping my eyeballs open with tooth picks. I going about 20 pages then falling asleep.I'm sure this kind of book works for other people. Robin Hobb has a lot of fans.I'll probably try something else she has written."
1,Hated It,"I am a long time fan of Robin Hobb, but I hated this book. The story was slow and very repetitive. The main character was boring and the one character that was interesting was taken away. Trust me, if you have not read this book and are thinking about reading it, DON'T. The second book is worse than the first one; I couldn't even finish it."
4,"Four stars was a stretch, honestly","I'm a big fan of Robin Hobb- the Farseer Trilogy and the Tawny Man Trilogy are by far my favorite books. I think, unfortunately, that these books suffer by being written by my favorite author. This trilogy just doesn't stand up to the others.The setting is a bit odd....a confusing mix of old and new, but completely foreign. The politics and situations between the races I found interesting, but a bit confusing, and rehashed way too many times. The plot seemed to stop and start unevenly.I think my biggest disappointment was that I didn't find the main character all that likeable. He seemed nice enough, but I just didn't GET him. Somewhere that development that was so great in the Fareer and Tawny Man trilogies just got lost, and I ended up with a kind of bland main character."
3,A moderate beginning to a lame trilogy,"I'm a Robin Hobb fan and moderately enjoyed this first book in the series, but I wouldn't recommend it since Book Two is so dreadful. I do enjoy Robin Hobb's world building, and this new world has depth and history and felt very real. The young hero is likeable and sympathetic. But the plot is slow. Even sluggish. And most annoying of all, the hero refuses to understand and accept the things happening to him, when the reader has understood and accepted them long ago. I kept wanting to scream, ""Get a clue, Nevare!"" There's nothing worse than a stupid hero. Nevare is likeable in Book One, but he becomes very boring in Book Two -- no drive, no ambition, no good ideas. He's easily manipulated and just drifts wherever life pushes him. You might moderately enjoy this intriguing Book One, but what's the point? It only leads to Book Two, which I cannot recommend. Which is very sad, since I have loved Robin Hobb's other series."
1,Really disappointing,"Don't know what happened to her all of a sudden. I've read her Live Ship books, her Fool books and the other trilogy connected with those two and enjoyed them all. So when I saw this new one, at an airport bookshop on the way home from a holiday, I bought it with joy expecting another meaty and enjoyable trilogy. In the event I found it so dull, so unengaging that I actually gave up before I was even half way through - and I wouldn't have got that far had she not been an author I normally really enjoy. I found the plot dull and I had no interest in the central character and therefore no desire to find out what happened to him. What a disappointment. I've written this before I read any other reviews on this site. I'll now read a few to see what others found in it."
3,"Solid, but not spectacular","This was a solid, though unspectacular, performance from Robin Hobb.Her performance was somewhat akin to the basketball player who scores 14 points and six rebounds per game.Such a player is a solid starter, but not a star.this was not at all a riveting book. it took me about a week and a half to finish it. I used the book to read for about half an hour at bedtime before sleep overtook me.I found myself skipping through the shamanistic aspects of the tale, which I did not find credible, based on how the story was told.Some portions of the story involving Nevare and Epiny were interesting, but certainly not interesting enough to carry the book through 600 plus pages."
3,"Slow, but with hope of picking up","This book is not Ribin Hobbs greatest, I share this opinion with many who have read her previous novels which are defenitely better.But I would be remiss if I did not point out that like in her first series ( Assasin series ) her first novel was ok, not great, but ok. In this series I believe that the character development does take time and it has a lot to set up so any person can understand how the main character is and how he acts and will act to what happens in his life.So I hope that the second installment of this series will mark the return of the type of writting that marks great fantasy books like in Tawny Man series and Assisin series."
3,a little fun for your Home Depot line,"Fun, straight forward jewelry. Not what you would find every day. Perhaps you wouldn't want to. For the funky at heart....there is some neat stuff here, and lots of ideas you could always take to the next level. I really like the easy directions that ANYONE could follow, and ease of explanation of supply purchasing."
2,I wanted to like this book. We don't always get what we want.,"Honestly, I wasn't too thrilled with this book. Some of the designs aren't bad, if a bit simple for my tastes, and the instructions are pretty clear. However, the pictures are not particularly well done. The editing of the book left much to be desired. Overall, the book itself did not strike me as being of particularly good quality. While some of the designs weren't bad, I didn't find them very inspiring. I was really excited about receiving this book, but I was rather disappointed. If you're interested in the fabulous concept of turning hardware into jewelry, I heartily recommend Nicole Noelle Sherman's ""Making Designer Jewelry from Hardware, Gems, and Beads"" instead of this one. Personally, I enjoyed it a great deal more."
2,Skip if you're an adult,"Very simplistic designs: earrings made by tying a knot in one strand of nylon rope, a necklace made out of two L-brackets, a chain necklace made of S-hooks and jump rings, a coupling nut stung on a cord. It's a young adult book, but I thought some of the designs might be hip enough to pass as adult jewelry. I saw only one piece, made of hexagon-shaped nuts, that was appealing."
5,An Historical Novel that Encourages Critical Thinking,"I read this book to my two sons. Parts of it were too sophisticated for my six year old, but my ten year old really enjoyed it. He also read it at school. I appreciate the way Ms Cutler dealt with racism within the time frame of the story. She clearly conveyed the unquestioning attitudes of that time, and yet let Harry gradually realize what he was seeing didn't fit the 'facts' as they were presented by others. This was a good history lesson for my children. They not only learned alot about the St. Louis World's Fair, but also about common attitudes during that time, and the value of thinking for oneself."
2,Too many typos and factual mistakes,"This book is okay for a secondary (or tertiary) review tool, but only if you've done your real studying with a better study guide, such as PMP In Depth by Paul Sanghera. Exam Cram 2 (2nd edition) has enough factual mistakes (such as referring to ""the five knowledge areas"" of ""initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing,"" when these are actually process groups, and there are nine, not five knowledge areas) that I don't completely trust the other information I'm reading. Another example is that this book sometimes uses the terms ""process tool"" and ""process input"" interchangeably, although they are completely different concepts under PMI. And one potential answer to a test question about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs was ""self acquisition,"" which I think was a spellchecker's attempt to correct a misspelled ""self actualization."""
5,Must have,"If you plan to take the PMP exam, this one of the books that will help you.It was one of two books I used to pass the exam in 2005 (did not study the PMBOK) and it prepare you for the exam ... it focus on passing the exam"
4,Finally found it!,I love this CD. Iv'e been trying to find it for a long time. Finally thought of Amazon.com and found it right away!
5,Greatest hits of Andy williams,Andy Williams is an legend among singers. Reliving his songs helps me relive memories of my youth. The selection of songs is fabulous. Andy Williams reached his Moon River but we will enjoy his music each time this cd is played.
5,Andy Williams: One of the Greatest,"Though I haven't seen Andy on TV for quite awhile, I have heard him on the radioHe is still one of the best there ever was rating up there with Sinatra, Crosby, Martin and a host of others. Every song is truly a hit and has brought great enjoyment to me and I'm sure it will to you as well. I definately recommend this CD."
5,A must for all Andy Williams fans.,"Unlike the fan from Colorado Springs who must have written his review for a different CD, I rated this CD highly. It has no talking, no live recordings and definitely no medleys. The tracks on this CD are all classic Andy Williams songs sung in the way that only he can sing them - you can almost picture Elsa the lioness when listening to Born Free!"
3,Butterflies Coloring Book,"This is a pleasant coloring book. Butterflies are show in their habitat and good descriptions are given about their coloring and habitat. The backgrounds are fairly detailed, but in some this ways eliminates details in the butterflies themselves. Colored reference drawings are included in the cover for reference. I'd recommend this book for pleasure drawing for anyone school age and up."
4,Not for younger children,"This is a lovely coloring book. It's small, fine detailed drawings and the information written underneath is better suited for older kids. I bought it for my 6-year-old and I'll be hanging on to it for a couple of years."
5,how to done right,Very informative. and in depth material. Is strictly about how to prep and build w/ logs. very technical w/ good pic/drawings.
5,I wouldn't build with Logs without it!,"I own every book, set of DVD's and video tapes on how to build handcrafted log homes. The information that Robert has put into this book takes all the mystery away that all the others will leave you with. Some say it's too technical, but it really isn't. It is very concise and to the point. It is step by step from start to finish. No other book on log building says very much about sill logs. This is one of those mysteries the other books leave with you. It's a sure bet that you will ruin thousands of dollars worth of logs if you don't have this book by your side. Bottom line is, if you just want a library of books on log building, buy all the others. If you are really building a ""Handcrafted Log Home"" this book is a must! You'll be sorry without it."
3,log construction manual,very good book for constructing a real log home(not a kit) but little is of great use if your going with a log home kit.
5,Look no further for a book on this subject....,If I were allowed to have only one book on logbuilding this would be the one I'd keep. It is without a doubt the best written instruction guide I have found. Robert Chambers is one of those guys who seems to be able to explain complicated tasks in a very plain english kind of way. This makes it very easy for somebody like myself with no experience in logbuilding to be able to step outside and try some of the techniques on practice logs. He covers the very simple to the very complex and if you take your time and read it carefully you will understand both. If you are hiring someone to build your home this is still an excellent book for you. It educates the reader on where and how to look for good craftsmanship in a log building. I have read enough material on this subject to honestly say that all the others have left me with the question mark over my head. Good Luck and God Bless.....
1,Hysterically funny!,"I cracked up when I saw that Amazon had this CD listed. I came upon it inadvertently while searching for something else, but had heard parts of it when a friend who worked with the ""musician"" played it for me. It is amazingly and laughably bad, very cheesy music, like Barry Manilow would create after having suffered a brain injury. I agree with another reviewer that the one decent review had to be by a friend or relative, because this is really about the worst stuff I've ever heard. Also, being active in the Maine music scene, I can honestly say that Mr. Milazzo has no presence in it, let alone being a ""fixture."""
3,Not 6 pack of chicken,"The description makes this sound like a 6 pack of chicken packages. It is not. It is assorted like the photo shows. Good thing my cat was willing to eat the other flavors so far. I've just tried Salmon ones and both cats ate it - when they were used to the chicken. So that is good news.The 6 pack I got includes:2 chicken1 salmon1 tuna1 fish1 beefHope they like all the flavors, I was hoping for 6 of chicken because I know they like that."
1,Don't buy this poison!,"We received a free sample of Feline Greenies in the mail today from PETCO. Our 13 indoor cats gobbled the entire 1-oz. package in less than 10 minutes. Even our finicky eaters loved them. We are very careful pet owners, double-checking every ingredient in anything that they eat (in the same way that we watch our own food). Unfortunately, I fed first and checked later (something that I have NEVER done before and will never do again)!Imagine my dismay when I found menadione sodium bisulfite in this product. This toxic, unapproved ingredient has no business in our pet food. Its use is prohibited in many European countries, and our own FDA won't approve it.We have requested that PETCO discontinue the sale of this product immediately, until the manufacturer removes this poison.If you love your cats, you will not feed this product to them. Just do a web search for ""menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB)"". You'll be a better cat owner, that's for sure . . ."
4,Good start for 3 of Hearts,"I first learned of the group 3 of Hearts when I bought the soundtrack to the movie ""Where The Heart Is."" There was a song on there by them, titled ""Just Might Change Your Life."" There wasn't an album out by them yet, but I'm glad there is now. It's a great CD. I like how the girls share lead vocals often throughout the songs; it reminds me of SheDaisy, another group that I also love. My favorite tracks are 1, 2, 3 6, 7, and 9. I wish radio would at least give the new song ""Arizona Rain"" some airplay. Alot of reviewers have alot of mixed views about the girls' ages it seems, and how they sing about stuff ""too mature"" for them to sing. I suggest you buy the CD and judge for yourself. I'm someone who loves country music and one rock band: Hole. If a Courtney Lover can give 3 of Hearts a listen, anyone could."
4,Sugar and daisies,"The ""triple-hearts"" remind me on the ""Wilson Philips"" in the early 90s of the ancient century..."
2,Keep looking,"Although these are less expensive than the silicone Kitchenaid utensils, these are also of much lesser quality. I highly recommend the silicone versions, which are stronger, easier to clean, and will more than likely last longer than the nylon ones. I have owned the silicone set for over a year and they still look brand new. My parents purchased the nylon set less than 6 months ago, and they are already showing major signs of wear (scratches, etc.) If you want the quality that Kitchenaid is known for, go with silicone instead. It will save you money in the long run."
1,KitchenAid Culinary Utensil Set,"These are the worse utensils on the market for what you have to pay for them. They hold water in the handles whether you wash them by hand or in a dishwasher. When you pick them up to use them, the water runs out of the handles and drips into whatever you're trying to cook or prepare. Do not buy these!!"
2,Too heavy on the handle end,"These tools are made of high quality materials, and they look very nice. However, the ends of the handles are so thick and heavy that if you leave them propped on the side of a shallow pot or pan, or on the counter, they are very prone to flip out of the container or off of the counter, carrying food with them to the kitchen floor. This happened to me twice while cooking thanksgiving dinner. I will not throw them away, but I would never buy them again."
3,"Nice set, but too big","We received this as a wedding gift, and I was so excited because red is the color of our kitchen. However...when I opened the box and took the utensils out, I didn't realize how big they were. I'm a petite person with small hands. The grips are slippery and the utensil itself is so awkward to cook with unless you're my husband's size (6 foot and up). They remind me of knick-knacks: Pretty to look at, but not useful in any way."
3,"Nice, but big","I own alot of these KitchenAid red utensils and my only complaint is that they are too big. The handles are heavier than the bottom part so you can't leave the spoon or spatula resting in the pot on the stove, it'll just flip out, unless you have really tall pots and pans. Andre the Giant might enjoy using these, but I tend to reach for my other smaller spoons and turners before I use one of these. I have never had a problem with water getting into the handle."
1,Terribly designed,What were they thinking? Did they never actually TRY these utensils out after making them? The handles are so heavy that they constantly tip out of the pans if you tap them at all.
2,Don't immerse in water!,"I agree with the other posters about the balance issues, but I have a problem with the handles holding water and flowing out when it is turned right-side-up (my cookies got soaked!)Definitely keep looking."
2,Awesome set of cooking utensiles at first read update,They are big very big and built like a tank. No more cheap crappy one like you get at the store. I have no water issues getting in the handle.The only issue I would say is that the handles are heavy. However when I compare them to the cheap crappy one that bend when using which you can get from supermarket these are the best I ever have.My first impression however was DAMN THEY ARE BIG :P*UPDATE 4/21/2010* They seem to trap in odors they have started to smell no matter how many time I clean them smell like dirty mop water.
2,Just awful,"I have almost the entire ""Red"" collection from KitchenAid, and these are the only dissapointment for me. They are really bulky and the hold water inside them. Everywhere that has a seam from silver banding gets full of water. Everytime I wash them I have to shake them for a few minutes until all the water gets out them, otherwise it drips into whatever pot you are cooking with. I am thinking about giving them away or donating them to a charity. But I almost feel bad sideling someone else whith a cruddy product. Overall I DO NOT advise buying these!!"
1,not a long-lived product & horrible customer service,"I bought four Coleman rechargeable lanterns and they were great for one year. When I wrote the company (no way to call--fair enough but 6 weeks is a LONG wait for a response in anyone's book.) they responded that I needed to pull the switch (the problem) and then BUY new ones for all four lanterns, mail the old switches back to them and then they would ship me new ones. Forget it. I'm done with Coleman lanterns anyway. And they could use a serious reworking in their customer service department. I've heard GE makes a good lantern."
1,Bought 2 based on reviews and they are lousy.,"Bought 2 of these specifically for when there are power outages in my area. Liked the idea of using D cell batteries, which are easier to obtain. One lantern failed right away and the other one did last a little longer. Not a good buy for when you need emergency lighting. Had always trusted the Coleman name, but have my doubts now. Will be very cautious when buying Coleman products again."
3,Battery Life,"Well, the unit itself gave about 4 years of service. When it was new, it would last on high for about 4 hours, 6 on low. Now the lead-acid rechargeable battery is shot. Everything else is fine. No one sells replacement batteries. So, bye bye."
2,Heed the warnings here,"This was a good lantern for our camping trips last summer, but fast forward 5 months and pull it out of the closet to charge up in preparation for those winter storms - dead. Well, the nightlight worked for a while - but it won't charge at all. I borrowed a charger from a friend to see if that was the fault, but that did not solve the problem. Looking at the reviews here and on Colemans website, it seems this is a common problem where the lantern has not been used for an extended period. This is the second rechargeable Coleman product that has failed in less than 24 months of ownership. Disappointing - heed the warnings here - you might just be buying a disposable lantern."
1,lacks durability,"This would be a great lamp for those living (or visiting) areas with unreliable electricity except that the switch will inevitable wear out. Mine started malfunctioning (that is, the switch and thus the light) after regular usage for about 6 months. The problem is, the switch rubs against a metal plate and eventually (and inevitably), the plate will wear down to the point where the switch no longer makes significant enough contact with the plate. Poor quality choice on the part of Coleman and impossible to fix on your own unless you're a electrician and have the right tools (not sure you could actually replace the plate though since Coleman does not offer a replacement). I totally do NOT recommended purchasing this lantern since it's clearly not made to last."
1,Don't Buy!,"This is the second lantern that has failed. The first would not hold a charge. The second one died after 20 minutes. If you are thinking about buying this one, do a search on Amazon and see the other ""Retro"" listing (same product) with negative reviews. Very very disappointed."
1,Good when it works...which isn't very long,"Purchased this around 5 years ago, worked fine for a couple of camping trips, however like many others, with regular use the switch fails to turn the main light on. Night light continues to work.I took it apart and fiddled with it trying to get the main light to stay on to no avail. Guess I will just stick to the standard old fuel lantern."
4,Great Lantern but bit heavy,"It is a well-made lantern with a nice night light. The only negative is that it is quite heavy...about 7 lb. Thus, this is not recommended for backpackers who count every ounce."
5,Top quality,"Very well built, will last many years. Light output is excellent and battery life is longer than most. Rechargeable is a big plus."
5,lantern,"great light,purchased for power outages but have used 5 or 6 times for other things,so far so good no problems=happy camper,be sure to charge battery for a full 18 hours before first use these batteries have a memory and if not fully charged will not work properly."
1,not as described,"I like the lantern itself. It's bright enough and the battery makes it heavy enough to be very stable.But it does not come with the 12v cigarette lighter plug adapter,(part #501000320) which is clearly listed in the 'products features'I send an email to Amazon stating the problem and requested the adapter.Amazon responded by FedExing me a new lantern which I got the next day.(I order many things from Amazon even if they are higher just because of this service.)The new lantern...same missing item.I sent an email to Ron's Hardware, who distributes these lanterns. They totally ignored me not even offering me the courtesy of an excuse.The bottom line is, it's a great lantern if you don't think you need the 12v adapter. I expected it and considered it a necessary part of the purchase."
1,Don't buy this one,"The Coleman lantern I purchased was the largest one offered. Compared to my kerosene lantern, the kerosene lantern gives off more light and lasts longer. I was extremely disappointed. I wouldn't buy one again. This isn't any better than having a regular flash light.Coleman Retro Rechargeable Battery Powered Lantern (Family Size)"
3,VERY UPSET,I WAS DISCUSTED WHEN I RECEIVED MY LAMP AND FOUND I ONLY RECEIVED ONE WHEN I ORDEREDTWO AND PAYED $71.62 SHIPPING AND HANDLING FOR AN ITEM THAT COST $41.54.HAD I KNOWN THIS WHEN ORDERING I WOULD NOT HAVE PLACED THE ORDER.I WILL NOT BE USING AMAZON AGAINPETER
1,Stops working after little use,"Seems as though I am not the only person who liked the design enough to give Coleman a second chance after the first lantern failed, and then had the second one fail. That's about $100 spent on trying to get a working lantern. As the others reported, problem seems to be in the switch. Battery charges fine, but no juice to either the fluorescent or the incandescent night light. Not sure I want to bother to ship it to Coleman (heavy and expensive.) Too bad--it would have served my purposes in an off-grid cabin perfectly.I have on older model, rectangular shaped rechargeable Coleman that has been working for years, and the fluorescent tubes are available in most stores. but it lacks the brightness of the retro model."
2,good lantern...for awhile....,Lamp was great till the switch crapped out. I noticed that another reviewer had similar issues. Too bad. It was great while it lasted....
1,No replacement bulb!!!!!,"The light bulb burned out shortly after I received this lantern. I've been trying to find a replacement and have had NO luck at all. No one has it, not even Coleman.Why the heck did they use such a customized bulb for this product if they weren't going to keep making it!!!????!??If anyone knows where this bulb is available please let me know.I'm very disappointed with Coleman for this...."
4,impossible to find light bulb,"Love the lantern, but have been looking for a replacement bulb with little luck. The bulbs cost almost as much as the lantern with shipping. Haven't been able to find one in any store."
4,Great lantern,"This lantern is very bright and holds a charge well. It is pretty durable and I was a little surprised my the weight, but it hung nicely from a canopy ceiling with no problems. Love that you don't have to worry about fuel."
1,"barely used, stopped working","used twice, the main light just flickers and never turns on. The night light is still functional. Based on what other reviews seems like a common problem."
5,Replaceable everything,"I've had my lantern for at least 10 years and it's worked quite well until now. I charged it, took it camping and only the night light worked. I assumed the big bulb went out. I replaced it at Coleman part number 5010000244 which is in stock. They have two bulbs listed, one is out of stock, the other is available. I replaced the bulb, recharged the lantern and it still didn't work. At that point I realized it must be the battery. Got a replacement battery on amazon via Battery Geeks. Replacement part UB1250 Universal Sealed Lead Acid Battery, 12 Volts, 5 Ah. Battery arrived, I swapped them out, recharged the lantern and everything works great again. This lantern is sturdy, gives off nice light and I'm hoping for another 10 years!"
1,Disposable lantern!,Bulb burns out after 8-10 uses and no replacement is sold anywhere!! Rechargeable isn't good enough if you can't replace the bulb. Do not buy.
1,Do not buy - there is a huge issue with these!,"These Chinese made Coleman lanterns have a defect in the rechargeable battery. Most of them cannot be recharged more than a few times! Seriously. Go to the coleman web site and read the reviews on this product. I have one that I have to toss even though it's seen very little use. Just like the majority of other reviewers on the Coleman site, mine won't hold a charge even though it's seen less than half a dozen charge cycles."
1,No light bulb replacement available,"This lantern worked great until the light bulb blew out during a long power outage. Then I found out that the replacement light bulbs are nowhere to be found, even when ordering from Coleman direct. The bulb, ETU-HS S11W (part no. 5010000244) has been ""temporarily"" out of stock for over a year at Coleman and everywhere else I could search online and in big box stores. It appear that Coleman changes the light bulbs with every model and discontinues the older models. This makes these lanterns effectively disposable. My co-worker ran into a similar problem with another Coleman product. This is looks suspiciously like a scam to force you to buy new models. I will be avoiding Coleman brand from now on even if it costs substantially more."
1,Not worth the money,"I have bought 2 of these lanterns and they are not worth the money. There is something wrong with the switch and it quits working after 20 or so times of turning the lantern on. The same thing happened to both of my lanters, so it must be a defect for the whole line of products. Also, there is no way to remove the switch to replace it. It is made in one piece with the base of the lantern. I will not purchase another one of these or anything similar. I thought Coleman was suppose to be a good brand, but evidently not."
3,My lantern broke after its first camping trip.,"The lantern is great when it works. It has great lighting and if also has the nice nightlight.I used it for three days on one camping trip and then packed it away in a plastic storage bin. I was not especially rough on it but I store all of my camping gear in large plastic storage bins. A month later when I was ready to go on another camping trip, I tested it out and only the night light came on. I tried recharging the lantern, and I also tried replacing the bulb and nothing worked. The lantern is cheaply made and it even looks like it is cheaply made. I would spend a little more money and buy a quality lantern that will last for years."
3,adequate,Lantern works fine for what I use it for and the price was right however if you need something super bright this is not it.
1,Light Bulbs made of Unobtanium,"It worked great for a year - several camping trips - then the bulb broke. I have been driving around with the remnants of the bulb for two years - checking everywhere I have been for this damn thing...Yes, of course I checked the internet! Several people list them, on further inquiry NONE in stock!! Lots of people willing to hold your money while they put your name on a ""backorder"" list. Coleman - you blew it with this one bulls*** item. Turned to trash over a light bulb - Shame on you!"
2,No battery replacement available,"I have two of these lanterns. Unfortunately I have to throw them away while they are still practically in new condition. I mistakenly did not keep enough charge in them while they sat and now the batteries will not accept a charge. I looked on the Coleman website and they do not offer new batteries in their list of available accessories for this item. What a waste! If you are not able to plug these lanterns in at regular intervals, don't bother! Keeping them charged is too much trouble for me since I only use them seasonally and they get packed away the rest of the time."
1,defective bulb,"I used one star to get close to and counter the other negative reviews. I had the same symptoms. My lantern exhibitted a flash when the switch was turned on (nightlight worked ok)-turned out the bulb had failed . Contrary to other reviews, Coleman has a stock of bulbs (Feb 2013) and I ordered 2.To access the bulb, there is one screw on the red trim below the clear section. Then you have to unscrew!! the clear section and lift off the top. Not obvious. So the switch was not defective and I'm happy with my rechargable lantern.Also- the bottom of the lantern unscrews to access the hidden car charger- again, not obvious since the wall charger is separate. Overall, the lantern is great and lasts a few days on battery"
2,Missing Parts,"12 Volt adapter missing. Disappointing at best. Unit appears very nice but lack of an essential is not acceptable. While I have not contacted anyone yet, my expectations do not include such activity."
5,GREAT!!!,"This is the second lantern we have purchased, this one was a gift. Great for when the power goes out, even has a night light No one realizes how DARK it can get until a power loss, and this is like having an oasis of light. No worries about having a tons of batteries on hand, you just plug it in to recharge for the next time."
3,It's just not 'right'... hard to handle?,"I purchased this when it was on sale for $4.99. What a waste of $5! I bought it to use with cookie sheets and baking, but I can't get close enough to pick the sheet up without smashing the cookies that are on it! I had to use my good old cloth hotpad to get them out. The item is small, but not small enough I guess??I did give it 3 stars since, I suppose it would work well with pots and pans on the stove if you needed to grab the handle. This isn't the case with me since the handles on my pots do not become hot."
3,Why consecutive?,"I'm one of the ones who fall between the completist and the pragmatic music lover.Maybe this sounds silly to you, but I'd buy this box if it wasn't for the order of the tracks. I can't see any reason why different takes of the same song should follow one another? That way it becomes unreasonable to put the music on and listen to it while you're doing something else (I know I can program my CD player, but...). I can take 2 consecutive songs, but 11 ???!?!?This plagues every jazz reissue these days and I (and many others) hate it!Now playing: Charlie Parker: Yardbird Suite (Rhino). Now THAT'S a collection!"
4,Too Much of a Great Thing,"These recording contains some of Bird's greatest music, no question there. But unless you are a rabid fan, is there really a need to have every known take of every song?Instead, choose the 2-volume ""Complete Savoy Recordings"" at half the price. It contains the released version of every important track here."
1,Great Music in a Disappointing Package,"Need to be honest here -- the music is great, but the packaging is clumsy, hard to read. One disc was mastered at the wrong speed and you can't send it back because Savoy moved away. Bad news all around. Suggest you don't buy this one but wait until the inevitable reissue when hopefully they fix the problems. Me, I mailed my disc #4 off for replacement and never heard from Savoy again -- caveat emptor."
3,Dangerous Attractions,"Had a hard time getting into this story. I Still haven't finished. As I see it, story of a young woman, used by sisters husband, from wealthy family. Young man from the back county, feelings for each other and something happened. I have trouble wanting to read more. Sorry. I will finish the story."
4,Dangerous Attractions,"I am reading and almost finished with this book. It caught my attention quickly and has kept me involved since the first chapter. This is a very good book and author and I would recommend anyone to read this book. I have read other books by this author and always am pleased and entertained. It takes a really good, fast moving story to keep me interested and she has provided this every time!"
2,Just could not finish,This book was not for me. I just could not get into it. I thought it was very slow and did not catch my interest right away.
3,Dangerous Attractions,"I like love stories and mysteries, but would like a little less sexual situations. All in all, I did enjoy reading this book."
2,seriously?,"I filed this book under ""started but probably won't finish"" partly because it was painful to drudge through, and partly because the hero is so very un-heroic. I don't know if he gets better and I don't really care, however I had all I could take with him salivating over the heroin while she's injured & near death, not to mention boarding the ship in a life & death situation and all he can think about is how hot she is.The title ""Juvenile Attractions"" might have been more accurate. Obviously a lot of people liked it, if those aren't fake reviews, but it is not for me."
2,A dissenting point of view,"This was well written & very descriptive account of Key West in the 1800's. Plot was good but the telling of it was slow, drawn out & put me to sleep a couple of times. Can't recommend book unless someone is only interested in descriptions of schooners, scenery, parrots, & flora & fauna of the Keys. Otherwise the slow moving & plodding story is incidental to book. INMH"
4,My Review,I chose this rating because I thought it was equally thrilling as romantic. I loved how the author chose to write in many views not just one or two. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good book
4,excellent of showing understanding for E-commerce student,"This book provides a comprehensive understanding and explanations of a lot of terms that you may not come up with any idea before you are taking this book with you. From the beginning level of entry, this book could be easily understood by student, or even professionals. It explores you the general view of internet security for business applications and how could mangerial mangement should take any serious approaches on it."
2,Good but hardly any passion fruit flavor,"I have two vines producing passion fruit in my yard, and can't seem to get enough of the stuff. I was excited to find this syrup until I actually tasted it. The syrup tastes fine, but very little like passion fruit. The strongest flavor note is pear, with a vaguely tropical flavor underneath. Decent, but not at all what I expected."
1,Lose your $50 in 28 days or less,"Yeah, nice product. The only problem with it that IT DOES NOT WORK.I worked it through, from cover to cover following every instruction and prescription, and I did it all twice. Well, my accent is still with me, untouched, and people around haven't noticed any difference, whatsoever."
4,Pretty good but...,I think the CD-ROM could have been more useful if they had inserted some comments in addition to the sound and video clips. More examples should be given to illustrate contrasts.
4,PAS,What a man Ms Judson created in Jed..... I loved this book. It made me laugh with all its wonderful characters and it made me cry.....the relationship between Annie & Jed. The quilts were an extra bonus.... I could picture every one of them in my imagination. Suzanne Judson has a wonderful way with words. I hated to say goodbye to everyone. I hope she's working on another story for us.
3,Only one problem,"This was an extremely well written book. The plot was super good. However the language was really R-rated. I'm not a prude, but it seems that as well written as everything was, the bad language was un-needed. Ms. Judson is too good of an author to damage her writing by filling the book with expletives. I don't think I would read another of her books because of that."
5,World's Best Shoe (I think),"This is my third pair of Oxford shoes from Timberline and it is the only dress shoe that I will purchase again. I purchased my first pair before a trip to Europe; I took only this one pair to conserve on packing. I walked all over Rome and even attended a very formal wedding. The shoe was so comfortable and versatile that I continued to use them as my every day work shoe (business casual) for over two years. When they final wore out (after 2+ years of daily continual use), I purchased another and then another."
2,Good looks but bad quality,"The kettle looks very modern and pretty. However, its interior developed rust after several usage. Very dissappointed."
2,dissapointing,"Of the 3 or so hours on this dvd, the 70 minute-ish live part is the only thing you will ever be tempted to explore a second time, the documentary is pointless with no new information.and the live part...to say the least...is testing. the vocals are horrible, he may as well be singing entirely different songs the entire time...there albums have obviously been pro-tooled a lot."
4,a good time,"A well put together DVD for the ""Stinkiest band"" in the world. Easy to navigate, and with some pretty interesting side notes...a great collectors item for any fan of Cradle of Filth or Swedish metal."
2,Cradle of Unwitting Self-Parody,"The hype is more amusing than the music. This is ""The Munsters meet The Monkeys,"" an unwitting self-parody billing itself as ""The World's Most Extreme Band."" I'll remember that claim next time I'm being led passively from a bar to the forced laughter of my mates, or dropping a sock from my hotel balcony and videotaping it. I should have bought ""This Is Spinal Tap"" --the music's better."
5,amazing...,i wasn't expecting much from this dvd....but what i got back from it was beyond my expectations.The backstage footage was great. It makes you realize that they aren't heartless demons. They are actually drunken heartless demons. ha ha.
3,crochet set,"The set is suitable for a bare, packed, and leveled playing field. But, on grass the mallets are not heavy enough. It is suitable for younger children rather than adults."
3,Young Kids Set,While this is a good set it is really meant for young kids. The mallets and balls are smaller than a standard set of Croquet.
4,Purchased for Alice in Wonderland themed birthday party,"I bought these for my daughter's Alice in Wonderland themed birthday party to have a game for guests to play. They seemed to enjoy it a lot. My husband wanted to buy a more expensive, professional set, but it wasn't in the budget. I think this set will be great for playing with kids, and if we like it enough, we can but a more professional set later on."
3,Old fashioned fun,"I bought this for my six year old because it reminded me of my childhood playing in the backyard of my grandmother's house with my cousins. The mallets need to be put together, but it is very easy. The thing I like least is that you need to unscrew the mallets every time in order to fit them into the bag that comes with it :( I just found another bag to put everything in. She had some trouble hitting the ball at first, but with practice got the swing of it very quickly. Warning: the mallets are probably heavy enough to give a concussion, so I stand clear of her as she swings because small children do not have the control to hit without pulling back far. We even played it on a hot day with the sprinkler on to keep us cool and not a problem for a small amount of water on the wood."
3,wish it came with a soundtrack,"This was a great book to read over Halloween. It's spooky, chilling in places, but very human and down to earth. The characters are likable, just like the ghosts. The author knows her music and it shows. The ghosts were real blues musicians (and the live ones too). The stories are a bit much at times, but for a first book it's good. I wish I had a companion CD with it to listen to the blues and hear the songs as they're meant to be."
2,Wordy and not compelling enough for a 6 and 4 year old,"I tried reading this on Easter to my daughters and their 9 year old friend and lost them somewhere on the first page. It tries to cover both the history, meaning and current context of Easter and I think it's too ambitious. It jumps from topic to topic and while it's on a topic, the book meanders.The conversational tone felt strange to read aloud since it's not the way that I would normally speak to a child. It felt a little too falsely bright. It asks the child to respond to questions like, ""do you think...?"" etc. and I was left hanging because the kids weren't interested enough to respond.I'll keep looking for a book that explains Christ's place in Easter for the preschool set."
5,Absolutely the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is by far the best stethoscope on the market. Superior clarity of sound. It rivals the Littmann Cardiologist III for a fraction of the cost. I say give this one a try!!!!!!
1,Unsatisfactory,"Many of the reviews on this item were complimentary. However, I can not hear anything with this stethoscope! I passed it around to my classmates, nobody else could either. Changing the bells is next to impossible without breaking out the pliers. I eventually gave it to my son. Tried to save some money, but not worth it. I wouldn't use this product if somebody gave it to me for free."
3,"Decent, but you get what you pay for","This is a decent stethoscope, but definitely doesn't stand up to some of the better models. Fortunately, it get's the job done for what it's needed for. The earbuds are a little rough, but the weight gives it a solid feel."
3,Ok product,Heartbeat is not as loud as I was expecting but you can still hear it. Some of the ear tips hurt!
4,listhen cambodia childc,very good for old nurse or hmc ps turn off other sounds like tv music 1st make secure in ears listen for at least 30 seconds @ any stethoscope ps good
3,Good buy,"Good buy for the price. works as specified..easy to use the product as it comes in. Hard to install the accessories. product arrived quickly, happy with it."
5,"Great item, great price","A great price for a stethoscope with several options/attachments. Works great for what I need, which is helping with rescued cats and kittens. Thanks!"
2,"Good price, slightly uncomfortable","This is a very servicable stethescope for the price, even if it is painful to wear for longer than a few minutes at a time."
3,home use only,Works okay for home use only. My 3 year old daughter loves to listen to my heart beat. But is uncomfortable to wear. It seems to pick up any noise from you hand while holding it.
3,Box was pretty beat up,I am giving this as a Christmas gift and was a little disappointed when the box was all smashed. The stethoscope appears fine otherwise.
2,Get what ya pay for,"Just started nursing school, (expensive)... so i was trying to save a dime any way i could...YOU GET What YOU PAY FOR.If your starting into a medical field, make the investment and get a Littmann... i hear if you get a $75 to $100 stethoscope. it will survive for years to come."
4,Good value for money,We are not doctors at home. We bought this to check up on the babies and so far works as expected.
4,Cant beat it for the price,Does it work? Yes. Is it cheaply priced? Yes. Is it professional and solid? yes. Get it you wont be dissapointed.
2,Is not very sensitive,"You get what you pay for. I had hoped to hear my unborn baby's heartbeat with this, but never managed it. Just not sensitive enough."
5,Great value and performance,This is a quality product and a great value for the price. Highly recommend it.
1,nice price for junk,Bulky and stiff earcups.Sound is awful.Almost inaudible and useless item.I gave it to the kids to pretendthey are nurses. Buy something else.
3,Kinked straight out of the box so doesn't hang around neck,The acoustics are very good but my stethoscope is kinked up straight out of the box and cannot get it to go straight. If I still had the box I would probably return and purchase another. Disappointing for this reason because I do like the color and the sound quality. Any pointers on trying to get it straight? I am told by old time nurses that if it is already that bad it isn't going to get any better. :(
4,I can hear on this,"I'm not in the medical field. I can hear my heart beat on this. I read in a previous review, the ear pieces are tight and uncomfortable, and that is true.I hear my heart beat the best when I put it in the middle of the chest, a little above where your breats are.I imagine other ones let you hear better, but for the price, I think this one is good.Since I'm not in the medical field, I dont have anything else to compare it to."
1,Omron Stethoscope,"The stethoscope is of poor quality. The heart rythums are faint when using this scope even after adjustment to fit ears, changing bells, ear pieces and swivelling the head. Different users of this scope had the same results. Omron Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope in Black.This Omron product is not recommended."
1,"Good looks, bad sounds","I know at least some of you bought this stethoscope because George Clooney wears one just like it on ER. If good looks are what you want, that's a valid decision. This scope is very solidly built. The head is heavy, sturdy, and shiny, the tubing is nice and thick, and the eartips are really not as uncomfortable as the other reviews say. But unless you only play a doctor on TV, you'll be disappointed with the sounds you hear through it. It's relatively quiet and the high frequencies have a hard time getting through to your ears. The artifacts from the tubes rubbing together are very real, and sound louder than the heartbeat unless you are standing perfectly still. You might have read that stethoscope review where this scope got a 10/10 score on clarity; don't you believe it! I have a cheap scope from a $15 blood pressure kit that sounds louder and clearer. If you want cheap, go with that one. If you want to be a real doctor, buy a Littman."
1,barely hear a thing,"Got the stethoscope and barely hear my own heart, bought also to hear my babys heart beat and didn't hear a thing"
3,Tubing stiff,"Actually purchased to get replacement bell for my old (25 year old) Rappaport-Sprague. Part fit fine. The current tubing is a bit long and stiff...the kinks have not straightened out with about 2 months of use. But it's fine for basic auscultation, especially at this price."
4,"Good sound quality, nice assortment of accessories","I'm a state certified first responder, and only occasionally need to use these devices for taking BP and lung sounds ... So I am not a stethoscope expert ... But for what I bought it for (stocking my personal emergency kit and vehicle go-bags), they exceeded the requirements. The tubes don't feel like they will pull off like some uber-cheap ones I have used, and they pick up faint sounds well ( e.g. ped brachial pulses ). The rubber also doesn't look like it is going to rot. Good assortment of ear plug replacements, etc."
4,The Beat Goes On.........,"For the price, this is a very good stethoscope, the sound is good. As with the lower priced scopes, most of them are very uncomfortable for the ears if worn at great length, and this one hurts if worn for more than 5 minutes. I can't imagine anyone would be wearing it for longer than that anyway...just an FYI. It's a bit heavy but not too heavy. The attachment selection is great also.If you have a pet, it's very important to listen to their heartbeat as it is your own. Everyone should own a stethoscope, a blood pressure monitor and a basal thermometer. Get yourself an 8 second thermometer for the pets too !!"
3,I have never used the $150 kind...,"The audio quality is sensitive for the price;it is far better than a single tube/single diaphragmtype..ahhh, you'll hurt your ears if you rip the headrapidly from warm skin !!!"
4,Very Pleased!,"I read all the negative reviws for this scope, and I went with my gut, and just bought it, I am just now entering nursing school, so I did'nt want to spend too much on one. when I opened the box and got it out, yes it did have a few kinks, but a few twist and turns done it some good, and I do have to admit, the part that goes in your ear is a bit uncomfy, but other than that, I love it! I could hear clearly, and it was'nt too bulky. Im very pleased with my purchase! I will most def. tell people about this scope!"
3,good product overall,I bought this item last Spring. the only issue is that the quality of the sound is not the greatest (I have checked with an other brand) I like the extra pieces that comes with with it though
4,It works,I gave this to the manager of our local animal shelter and was told you could hear a dog's heartbeat really well.
5,"Good product, great sound!","I'm currently nursing student and I bought this product to take my blood pressure/heart sounds exam. I was kind of reluctant to purchase this one because I thought the price was really cheap, therefore it couldn't be that good a stethoscope. I was really wrong. I can hear perfectly through this stethoscope, even more so than the one's we have in our nursing lab. I would suggest this to anyone interested in a stethoscope at a low price."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"Wanted a spare stethoscope that worked well and wasn't expensive. This one works better than the expensive one I originally bought as a med student! Great quality, affordable price."
4,a bit bulky and heavy,"This stethoscope has very good sound quality, and an assortment of bells to listen to different things.However, the tubing feels somewhat bulky and inflexible, and can get in the way sometimes. The stethoscope is a good deal heavier than others. It doesn't come with a bag!"
5,Worked Great!!,"This Omron Stethoscope has worked great for the price. Used it for a couple classes, handed it down to a friend and its still be using it. Very durable."
3,Ear pieces are like needles into your brain,"Like others who have said so, our largest complaint for this guy is that the ear pieces stab directly into your brain. The whole apparatus is pretty stiff and heavy which makes this problem even worse. We have tried the wider ear piece ends with improve things a little, but not enough to relieve the dread when we contemplate using these. For the money, however, the quality is otherwise excellent. It's a 1 for comfort, and 5 for bang for the buck to average out to be a 3 star item."
2,Toy- NOT Tool,"This stethoscope hooked me because I didn't want to pay the big bucks for a Littmann... Well, I should have! The acoustics are only slightly better than an educational grade stethoscope. I would not recommend this to anyone using it professionally or in a Nursing program. Invest in something better on the front end rather than having to buy a nicer one after wasting money on this one. I will be giving it to my children to play with."
5,GOOD STETHOSCOPE FOR THE PRICE,PURCHASED THIS SCOPE AS A BACKUP TO MY 35YR OLD+ SCOPE.THE PLASTIC DIAPHRAGM ON MY OLD ONE IS CRACKED SO I DECIDED TO TRY THIS ONE.AS SOON AS I RECIEVED IT I TESTED IT AND IT ACTUALLY IS A LOT BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE.IT PICKS UP SOUNDS THAT MY OLD SCOPE DIDN'T AND THE PEDIATRIC SIDE OF THIS SCOPE IS JUST AS SENSITIVE.IT IS A LITTLE HARD ON THE EARS TO WEAR FOR A LONG PERIOD.THIS SCOPE ALSO COMES WITH EXTRA PLASTIC DIAPHRAGMS AND EAR PIECES.I'M HANGING IT UP FOR A WHILE TO TRY TO STRAIGHTEN THE TUBES.THE TUBES ARE MADE OF RUBBER AND THAT MAKES IT SOUND A LOT BETTER.ANYONE LOOKING FOR A LOW COST DECENT STETHOSCOPE I'D RECOMMEND THIS ONE.
4,Good Value for the Price,"I'm a medical surgical nurse and I need a stethoscope that is sturdy with good sound quality to hear heart,lung and bowel sounds. The Omron Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope meets my needs. It is a good value for the price. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a workman type stethoscope."
1,"Didn't work, painful in the ears even when adjusted","Didn't work for us. We couldn't hear anything except when we tapped the end part. If it can't pick up a heartbeat what's the use? Also, the earpieces are tremendously painful in the ear even when fully adjusted. If you're looking for a cheap and handy stethoscope, I'd avoid getting this model. We actually returned ours."
1,I can barely hear anything with them,"I don't know if I got a pair of defective ones, but I can hardly make out my daughter's heart beat and it won't help with the lungs."
1,Can not hear,This would be good as a child's toy or maybe I just got a defective one. They charge for you to return. It's cheaper for me to keep and give to my daughter as a toy.
5,"""Beats"" the heck out of competition up to triple the price","This is totally unbelievable to have this much quality at this price point. One would think at this price point youd get only a disposable kind of quality which was my original expectation from it. With my Amazon Prime this was purchased next to nothing.After receiving it, I was amazed to see the quality was top notch. No cheapy feel to it at any part or end of the device. Then I immediately tested its performance and it once again amazed me with what I can do at this price. I've tried different kinds of this device and I can attest that this is way above regular stetoscopes and hangs around up there with the big dogs which are all in the 10x the price.So, for recommendation, if you really really like your top end device, this is perfect spare in the office or car. If you're an occassinal user or in profession where ""beats"" is not mission critical, like could cause life/death, this is more than perfect."
4,Omrom Stethoscope,"As my husband's caregiver, I have to take his blood pressure twice a day. The automatic machine I was using was unreliable because my husband's tremors caused it to give false readings (152/129). I am learning to use the stethoscope better, but I am still not totally comfortable with it. I wish it were not so heavy, but his home health nurse says it is a very good stethoscope and commended my purchasing such a good one on the internet."
4,"good, for the price","I am not in medical school or trying to became a nurse, I just bought this to hear my heart. And for the price I paid it does the job. I can hear mine and everybody elses just fine. So overall I am pleased with my purchase. So If you are going to school to because a nurse and you have a low budget, get this. It is good."
2,Unimpressed.,"47 y/o MD purchased this stethoscope for office ""back up"" to my Littman Cardiology and regret purchase. Online positive reviews are overstated - this model is heavy/bulky and has poor acoustics/amplification. Heart sounds are muffled and diaphragm seal is inconsistent.This model is inexpensive and priced appropriately for its low quality. Will spend $175 and buy another Littman in near future."
5,Awesome product!!,I love my stethoscope! It was at a very reasonable rate and it was worth every penny paid. I would consider paying more for the same product!
2,Can barely hear our own heartbeats,"We bought the unit to hear our kid's heartbeat in the womb, but can bearly even hear our own heartbeats with the unit. Would not recommend it."
5,Very good!,For the price this stethoscope is great. Only one complaint..it is not very flexible but as a nursing student does the job very well and the sound is perfect.
4,Good to go,"Good scope for EMT work. It's pretty simple and cheap but works well for the price. The dual-heads are great when working with kids. Also, pretty good sound range for a $13 scope. I would recommend it for any basic EMTs looking for a reliable scope that you wouldn't mind losing or throwing out to get a new one. It gets four starts, because one of the sides of the dual tubes broke off while I had it in my bag and it couldn't be fixed. Overall though, good product and you can't beat the price."
3,A weight around your neck!!!,"I reluctantly give this a 3 star.It does work but this thing is heavy around your neck.Feels like you have the BP cuff with you but you don,t (JUST THIS HEAVY STETHESCOPE!)"
5,Stethescope,"Excellent product and value. Just what the professional would need; a durable, reliable piece of equipment that is also professional in appearance."
3,A good stethoscope for school use.,"Stethoscopes grow legs frequently and walk off. This is a great stethoscope for a student. It is fairly inexspensive so if lost, it can be replaced quick and cheap.This model does not come with the soft ear buds that I like. And the sound quality compared to a Litman is lacking. That is the reason for the 3 stars.If you are in school and don't want soft ear buds (and you will) this is for you."
4,Does its job,Overall I think this stethoscope is a great buy for the money and works well with the new blood pressure cuff that I bought. My only complaint is that when I adjusted the angle of the ear pieces that the left side went silent at a certain angle - this was remedied by twisting it back into place.
5,Great product,This a great product. It works wonderfully keeping my horses in their area. Shopped around and couldn't find a better price. I will be a return shopper!
2,"Works great, if the sun shines","After 2 days of little sun, the charger is dead. The company generously supplied a new battery. That worked for a few months, but now if there is little sun for 3 or more days - it is dead. Buyer BEWARE"
2,Lower output voltage than advertised.,"I was disappointed to only get about 4KV output voltage from the Fi-Shock SS-440 solar powered unit. It was advertised to produce 8KV +/- 20%, so that should be about 6.5KV anyway. Mine is only producing 4KV. It is installed and grounded according to the Fi-Shock booklet. It is only a single wire about 1/3 mile long with no weeds, so is clearly under the 5 mile advertised rating."
3,so-so,"We live in SW NM and we have sun, sun, sun, but found this charger will sometime NOT hold a charge for a day or longer. It is in the open and has all day sun exposure. A bit of a disappointment and the company is of no help in wanting to fix it or make it right. It is a poor product that was from the start and if we want to replace it or get it fixed (right after we bought it) they want us to pay shipping to get it back to them. SO, we are hoping for the best that the horse knows that it works (most of the time) and will respect that and not charge through the fence."
4,work good on my horse.,"you have to make sure it got a good ground, samll eound to take with you. hander good if some one needs a smaller solar this is it."
1,product is misleading,fi-shock does not make a 10 acre one. the highest solar panel is 5 acre. so i returned the product
2,not suitable for flight training,"My son and I have no flying or RC flying experience. While mastering the delicate control required to take off and land the B-29 RC, we destroyed all propellers and thus were never able to enjoy flying the RC aircraft. I would not recommend this toy to anyone unfamiliar with flying RC aircraft. Look for a more durable product for a first attempt."
1,Buyers Beware,"I bought my B-29 because it was the only 4 engine plane I could find (cool factor). To my utter disappointment, I found that the plane was severely underpowered and was unable to fly. I have tried several times to balance this beast and have not succeeded. Although the B-29 looks (and sounds) really cool, for me, it was unflyable. It never got enough lift/power to go anywhere but into the ground."
2,B29 good start but lacks quality,"This product starts with a great price, but leaves a lot to be desired in the directions. The english is dificult, and the quality of the parts in the plane are not up to other manufaturers. The decals are not correct for the plane. The landing gear wire broke while I was installing it and it rather seriously cut my hand. It took about three hours to assemble and I am an experienced modeler with access to excellent tools. I have't tried to fly it because I don't trust it to stay together in flight. It is not ready to fly when you get it!!!!"
1,Cheaply made,My first landing was tragic...... I had the plane graising the grass then it suddenly did a front flip and te fuselodge broke in half..... Would not recommend........................
2,Avoid this book. doesn't do a great language justice,"This book was written in only a few weeks by an outsider for free distribution at the PDC for reasons only the marketing folks can explain, it doesn't do a great language justice!I'll give the author credit for a valiant attempt however considering what must have been his very limited time with C# and he's a clear writer which is very good. Still, the author of this very small and lightweight book has only limited information and experience with the C# language and it shows.While I am not an expert on C#, I do know enough about it to know he skips important features of the language or doesn't emphasize features that should be emphasized (like versioning). All in all he simply doesn't do a great language justice.The book to get is Eric Gunnerson's ""A Programmer's Introduction to C#. Gunnerson is on the C# design team at Microsoft and knows the language as well as anyone. His book has oh 10 times the information Wille's slender book has..."
4,Nice presentation.,"A well done ""do you have an evening"" book that provides a quick review of the feature set available in C#. The examples are concise and conceptual, so if you're comfortable with C++ or Java then this book will expand your brain just fine; if all you know is VB then you may want to wait for something more comprehensive. The Java influence is blatant, to the extent that I think there should have been a chapter devoted to a compare and contrast against the Java language and programming model. If you're into Microsoft programming stuff buy this book.Now, if I could just get my hands on the C# compiler..."
2,"some good info, but already out of date","Bottom line, this book is out of date. For example, trying to create a dynamic array. The book shows you how to do it and even provides sample code. However, the sample code doesn't compile on the latest public beta of Visual Studio 7. Digging through more recent documentation, I found that the the method of creating dynamic arrays has changed. This makes me wonder how much else in this book is out of date."
2,Presenting C# ...mmm.... Could be presented better,"1. Not enough in depth info about the CLR.2. Not very good index.3. Chap 6 (control statment) should be a lot shorter specialy in 190 pgs book.4. Chap 8 (Writing components) is way too simplistic, that would be understandable for an introduction but at least i would want to know a little bit more of the backhouse work.5.Nothing about XML except for documenting C# code. come'on that the XML millennium we're talking about here...6. Chapter 5 (classes) is good it covers everything i needed and it is well written."
2,console programs,"This book joins the stampede teaching console programming. You have to work in the black screen DOS environment. The authors seem never to have heard of windows. Do they write DOS programs for a living ? I think not. These books should carry a warning "" Reading this book will teach you nothing useful """
3,"Its a reasonable intro, but its no more than an intro","On the whole I found this book was pretty good as far as it went, it just didn't got far enough. For example, the coverage of interfaces and abstract classes is very nearly nothing. I was expected a book on the C# language, and this is not the book I was after. I think the word Presenting in the title is misleading. This book does not present C#, it only introduces it. It also introduces the .NET platform.information. On balance I'd have to say you'd be better of slogging your way through the C# Language Reference (free download) or reading one of the C# FAQs that are springing up."
2,Too light on content,"I was expecting a K&R type introduction to C#, but while this book didn't cover the very basics (thankfully), neither did it get into any serious content. Most of the information in this book can be gathered online from Microsoft and other sources. In the example code, the author sometimes uses concepts that have not been previously introduced -- sloppy. Also frustrating is that he devotes very little to C# specific concepts that should be the focus of the book.I get the feeling that previous reviewers seem to be allocating stars to the C# language rather than this book! I recommend waiting for more substantive books on C#."
3,Good presentation for C# but lack of .....,"This books is good for introduction and a glance to what C# is and what it can do but the most important part of the language is a bit weak on this books such as interface, delegation and event for C#. It should focus more on that rather then focusing on the normal syntax such as logical statement coz it should provide a comparison chart for C++ and VB against C# even better. By anyway, it provide me a better idea on the differences between C++ and C# and I think this is the best we can expert based on the length and price of the book.Thanks for reading my review:-)"
1,"Rifs aplenty, but where's the melody?","Mr. Mengleburg may very well be famous in Holland for his jazz stylings, but he falls way short of my expectations. His compositions seem to be flying fingers and crashing notes, with no heed to finding a melody line. I like to at least recognize an old standard when I hear one. After putting the CD into a random pattern play, I sat back to listen. After a few tunes had played, I began to scan the list of titles as I had yet to recognize anything. I was astounded to learn I had been listening to old standards--Begin the Beguine, Someone To Watch Over Me, etc. Not one song had I recognized. Improvisation is wonderful, but not to the extent of wiping out the entire melody line. On the positive side, ""House Party Starting"" was fairly benign, and the rhythm section sublime. But I could not recommend this album, nor any of the Misha Mengleburg's music to anyone I know."
5,"Sturdy, steady, beautiful and made in the USA!","Finally I own an easel that doesn't 'walk' across the studio! I had trouble with two of the knobs, but that didn't keep me from starting my largest painting to date! The maker has already sent replacements in the mail. They were efficient, no questions asked, great to deal with! I highly recommend this easel. My mother just bought the same one after seeing mine! I am a happy painter!"
3,Crazy Wild,"I've really enjoyed the ""Crazy"" series. However, this book was my least favorite of the bunch."
4,This book is actually 4 1/2 stars,"I guess I came into reading this book with hopes of really getting to know Creed and Cody. I think not reading about him in the 2 previous books made it harder for me to get to know him, and it seemed like half of Crazy Wild was setting up the love affair for another pair of the Steele Street regulars. Overall, I loved how Creed and Cody worked things out, and the extent Creed was willing to go to for true love.I really wish this book mentioned more about Quinn and Regan. I loved their story!"
3,BORN TO BE CRAZY WILD!!!,"This little adventure/romance had me sitting on the edge of my seat, reluctant to finish reading at the end of each chapter. Mile a minute adventure thru most of the book. I thought the 'romance' got bogged down somewhat in the last third of the book. Sensuality was an 8. Mostly well done.Creed was wild, the best at what he did. Cody was misunderstood by everyone. Nice little book. I will look for others by TJ."
5,Hot!!!!!!!!,"I just think that this book was ""HOT"" from start to finish. You will fall in love with Creed in this third installment of Tara's new series. If you missed the first two books Crazy Hot and Crazy Cool, they are a must read also. Her stories are amazing!!!"
3,Too long love story for a thriller,"The thrilling warhead part of the book is really good and a page turner. But the last 100 pages when the two loves stories start is getting bore and bore. When you get again to the warhead story you almost forgot that you were reading a thriller instead of a love story. When you start to read about the love story you'll say: OK this'll be two pages and then will be going on with the thriller, but that's wrong. The love story is long enough to get you boring if you longing to read a thriller."
1,"Good book, bad kindle edition","This is a great book, but the Kindle edition is terrible! It lacks a table of contents, and the formatting is not correct. How can we tell, before purchasing, whether the kindle edition of a book has been done adequately? This product is unacceptable."
1,No good for older babies,"I would not suggest this book if your baby is older than one. There is not engough information in the sections for older babies and toddlers. Moreover, you have to read all the chapters before that don't relate just to understand the various terms and methods referenced. Even if you read the whole book, you still are left without good guidance on how to treat an older baby, particularly in the transition to one nap. I am a father of three and my experience was more helpful than the book."
2,CIO method in disguise,"This book is nothing more than the ""cry it out"" method in disguise, so unless you agree with that particular parenting philosophy, this isn't the book for you."
2,Didn't work for us,"We tried the methods advocated in this book until our little one was 7 months old. Finally, out of exhaustion, we abandoned the ""Sleep Lady"" entirely and brought our little one into bed with us. Lo and behold, ALL of us got more sleep. If you have all night every night to keep going back into your kiddo's bedroom to pat and shh while they wail for want of affectionate cuddling, read this book. If not, skip it."
4,Best baby sleep book I bought,"I needed to get my baby out of our bed and into her crib. She was only 7 weeks old at the time. Most people and books said she was too young for sleep training but not Kim West. I am glad I followed the book's advice. My now eight and 1/2 week old is sleeping great in her crib. She is a happier baby and my husband and I are better rested. This book is good for offering specific age recommendations, especially in the newborn to five month chapter. This was very helpful. I also have Great Sleep Habits, Healthy Child by Weissbluth, which is ok, but I like Kim West's book better."
2,Rushed and Shallow,"I purchased this book because I previously bought a 20 page pamphlet written by Kim West. The book contains no more information than the pamphlet - it's just supplemented by personal accounts and obvious suggestions such as the need for parents to get exercise and sleep. The section regarding transitioning from two to one naps is especially disappointing because she refers to the transition as one of the most difficult issues that ALL parents deal with, but then spends barely a page on the topic. I am disappointed because I needed real, substantive coaching on this transition."
2,Good tips but not that gentle,"This book offer the same general advices that most baby sleep book offer, like keeping baby on a schedule, establish a bed routine, be consistent. The method suggested for teaching baby to sleep on her own is certainly more gentle than the ferber one, in that at least the baby is not left alone in her room -but it still is a crying it out method -at least for my baby. My 9 motnhs old has problems with night fears and this book didn't offer any advice on how to deal with it. So in conclusion I'm still nursing my baby to sleep and bringing her to bed when she wakes up in fear at night, but now I don't try to put her back into her crib so she sleeps longer."
2,Not a fan.,"This was one of my LEAST favorite sleep books. And we went through a LOT of them. I didn't like that she really only dedicates less than a paragraph to describing her technique, but then referred to said technique throughout the whole book. As a sleep deprived new mom, I really wanted something step-by-step spelled out for me in terms I could understand at all odd hours of the night, but instead I was left second-guessing and shuffling through the book repeatedly trying to find some hidden secret outline that wasn't there."
2,Cookie-cutter babies?,"I read one chapter of this book and was left feeling like I was doing everything wrong - the author assumes that every baby is the same and that all babies have the same temperament. From day one, my baby has not been a napper. She is four months old and we've finally gotten to the point where we can get her to nap (at all) without being held, and her naps are still only 40 minutes, a few times a day - and she only will nap (GASP) in her swing! In my opinion, it's ridiculous for the author to insinuate that every baby falls asleep in the same way and that every baby sleeps the same number of hours each day. While there may be good tactics in this book, which could be helpful in getting your baby to sleep longer and fall asleep more easily, her attitude of what you should and should not be doing is very condescending, as if rocking your child to sleep will scar her for life..."
3,"Decent book, not the easiest to read.",Book was in great condition and arived on time. But it's not the easiest to read when you are really pregnant.
5,Excellent book on getting parents on track,"Parents need to be aware of what is really required for happy and healthy children. This book details the importance of proper sleep and rest for a child'd healthy development. Very good book and if you follow and are persistent, both child and parent reap the rewards. You in your bed, them in theirs, all night, only to wake up refreshed and happy. Who could ask for more?!"
5,Mom of 6.... ALL GREAT SLEEPERS thanks to this book!,"When my first born was 11 months old I found out about this book and knew I had to get it. I used her methods to gently teach him to sleep at 11 months old. Before that, I had to rock him numerous times a night. My husband and I were severely sleep deprived. Since then I have used this book to teach all of my babies to sleep from day one and people are always surprised when they are at our house and we take all of our children and put them to bed in about 5 minutes without a cry or a single sound. I have used this with our foster babies and children as well. I did this with a 2 1/2 year old who was accustomed to sleeping in her parents' bed before she came to us. It worked miraculously.. within 10 days she was pretty proud to feel like a big girl and be climbing into her own bed without a single objection.Excellent resource!! Don't have a baby without it!"
2,Questionable content,"The book appears well written but I do question some of the content. I found the discussion of research on cosleeping and SIDS incomplete and even misleading and did not find helpful ways of solving sleep problems while continuing to practice cosleeping full time, not just for part of the night."
2,Buy the hard copy if you want this book,"West presents a compassionate approach to sleep training that is a gentler version of cry it out. Other reviews summarize the content so I will not repeat here. My biggest issues with this book are as follows:- the ebook has no table of contents, therefore you have to flip through page by page to find what you want. This is a humongous pain in the neck.- whoever did the formatting for the ebook should be fired. I suspect that in the hard copy there are insert text boxes with anecdotes and highlighting specific points, but in the kindle version this format does not work well. The anecdotes sometimes start in the middle of a paragraph, making reading difficult.- the suggestions for each age group are essentially copied and pasted with very little age-specific modifications. The book is very repetitive, and could probably be about 40pct shorter and still convey the main points.Overall, not worth the price in my opinion. I would not recommend."
4,Good advice...,"Seems like a good blend of strategies for establishing a sleep routine, which is one of the most important things you can do as a parent. For those who want something less extreme and able to be adjusted to fit your child."
1,Nothing gentle about this book,"Do yourself a favor, and listen to your gut instead of what this book says. This book basically advocates crying it out for all ages. Her suggestions for soothing a baby are saying ""sh-sh"" and rubbing a baby's back. Well, that doesn't work when a baby is frantic and doesn't understand why you are ignoring her cries. After following some of the advice in this book for one night only, I feel I now have to work to regain the trust of my child. Yes, my child did not cry alone as in other methods, but there was still nothing gentle about it. Do what feels right to you as a parent. No book is going to have a magic answer for getting your family more sleep."
3,An OK book about sleep,"If your baby is calm and even tempered this book could work for you. It assumes that babies are easy and will respond in the expected way. Most babies with sleep issues, like mine, require more information and a more specific set of ideas to improve sleep. Also if you breastfeed or have a family bed this probably isn't the best book for you as the author clearly doesn't address these issues. Aimed at younger babies so if you have an older baby or toddler you may not find your answers. Also if you have the 20 page booklet by West this is just an expanded version of the same. Recommended: The No-Cry Sleep Solution"
5,good advice from a sleep therapist who's also amom,"When I was pregnant in 2005, I read ""Babywise"", ""Baby Whisperer"", Dr. Ferber's book, and a bunch of other books that basically recommended some form of ""crying"". Now with my 2nd child (2008), this book seemed to work a little better with this child...The ""Sleep Lady Shuffle"" still has the babies crying, but not quite as loud, and it eases them into falling asleep by themselves. I was reading both ends of the book, since I still have trouble with my 2 1/2 year old after illnesses/vacation/etc. She also gives suggestions for how to re-coach the kids when they've ""forgotton"" how to go to sleep by themselves. I recommend this book. She also has a monthly newsletter (email) that has helpful hints from her book."
1,"AWFUL BOOK, AWFUL STRATEGY","Save yourself months of trouble and DON'T read this book. This strategy = waste of time, energy and lots of unnecessary tears. The idea is to quell your child's tears but after struggling with this theory I learned that tears for one or two nights without mom are far better than tears for weeks with mom in the room. HORRIBLE STRATEGY!!"
2,"Same old, tired, advice","This book is the cry it out way. If you don't mind listening to your baby cry, or more accurately with this particular method, WATCHING your baby cry then great, get this book. But if you have a sensitive, attatched, and slow to self sooth baby then this book is not for you. I would suggest The No Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley."
4,Will continue recommending to my clients (and myself)!,"I work with infants/toddlers, and have recommended this book to many of my clients, however admittedly, I had never read it. After a brief vacation for me, away from my family, my typically good sleeper fell apart. she couldn't fall asleep or stay asleep. I read the book, focusing on the steps for a 2- 1/2 year old. I had tried the techniques, but appreciated the detailed tips on how to really use the system. The book was quite helpful!!!!! It's a straight forward, gentle approach. The book is well written, easy-to-read, and includes several ""real life"" stories, which I always enjoy. I will recommend this book to others, and use it if/when we struggle with our other children!"
3,Vague,"This book is pretty good as it details sleep issues for many different stages in a child's life BUT on the whole was a bit vague on the sections where I needed help. It didn't really go into the full specifics for trying to get our son to sleep through the night but I guess every baby is different. If you are trying to get help for your baby to sleep better then this book is certainly worth a read, but I am sure, like us, it probably won't be the only one you buy......................................sorry I dozed off there <g>, sleep deprivation."
2,OK,"This book wasn't for me. I think she wrote it for younger babies. My son is six months old and there wasn't that much help in the book for that age group. Also I was not able to handle letting my son cry, It just caused me more stress and even less sleep. But every child is different and every parent!"
2,2 under 2,I like the idea of this book but it is not workable with a 19 month old and a 5 month old. I can't take the time to sit with the 5 month old to let him get to sleep on his own while the other one is getting into everything that isn't and is strapped down. Maybe when the hubby has time off we can give it a try.
3,It's okay,"I needed something to tell me how much my baby should be sleeping and to give some direction on how to help that happen. If you want to or need to impose a schedule on your baby, this book is the least dogmatic I've read. It's also okay if what you want is some general baby sleep information."
4,Very informative sleep book,"I am so glad that I found this book. This is a great book for any parent to read, whether or not you actually use every piece of advice. I have read The No-Cry Sleep Solution previously, but it didn't really work for our family. I also did not believe in the Cry It Out method, which certainly didn't work for my daughter. This is a great mix of the two. West gives very commonsense advice for sleep problems, in a very easy-to-read manner. My favorite piece of advice was that if your child uses a pacifier and wakes up hunting for it, hand them the binky instead of putting it in for them. That way they learn to do it on their own (something that I should have thought of on my own!) This book is just what sleep-deprived parents need, especially if you are okay with just a little crying for everyone's better sleep habits."
3,Some movies are better left in memory,"Was really excited to see these movies on blu-ray, couldnt wait to get them. They did a pretty good job on the transfer, the problem is that it was poor quality ro start with. The sound effects are just terrible, to me the video is way better than the original and the second disk is in 7.1 and sounds better than the first, but the second movie is dumber than I remember. All in all the first movie is hands down the best of the series, picture quality is pretty good considering. As always it was a pleasure doing buisness with Amazon."
1,Card only supported on Windows XP based OS,"This card wasn't horrible when used on Windows XP MCE. However, Windows XP MCE was horrible. This card is completely incompatible with either Vista or Win7.I purchased it not long before Vista shipped so the complete lack of Vista support has led to it being replaced. I still check to see if there are any drivers every couple of months but still to date there is no driver passed the XP MCE driver for this card."
4,Intense,"This is a very intense CD. Unfortunately, the mix is not that good (I have a better copy that was made on my home cassette machine during the sessions, where you can hear all of the instruments!) and they could have picked better takes. Hopefully, some day they will remaster it and fix it because ""Drums"" shows that Mingus was going in a different direction and was still on fire, even when he was in the wheelchair! ""Carolyn"" and ""Farwell"" are two beautiful late ballads.Paul Jeffrey is mistakenly credited as composer on all but one track. Mingus composed all of the tunes. I arranged and orchestrated all of the tunes except ""Farwell"", which was arranged and orchestrated by Jeffrey and an uncredited Ricky Ford.Jack Walrath"
5,Best product I've found.,"My husband has always had problems with toenail fungus and I eventually got it, too. Prescription medications didn't do much and I heard about Vick's, but that didn't do much either. Then I read that because Vick's is petroleum based, it keeps the nail moist, which isn't good and it's this one ingredient in Vick's that really works. We have both been using Amoresse Thymol for quite some time. It cleared my nails up completely and highly improved my husband's. I just use a drop every few days. Yes, it smells like Vick's, but I don't think it's that unpleasant compared to the results it brings. This stuff is very inexpensive and well worth it, in my opinion."
1,Ineffective product and terrible customer service,"I purchased this product with great hope that it would be effective for my nail fungus; I ordered two bottles, however, when the product arrived one of the bottle's cap was loose and 1/2 of the contents had leaked all over the packaging! I contacted Dermadoctor's customer service on three separate occasions, and they NEVER got back to me! So I used the other bottle that I ordered without any positive results. I saw no change in my nail fungus (I did see progress utilizing Vics previously), and because of their non-existent customer service I was really discouraged. I finally contacted Amazon, and they graciously refunded my purchase amount. Thank you Amazon, no thanks to Dermadoctor!"
5,Uno de los mejores productos,Despues de tiempo luchando con hongos en la uña del pie este fue la solución sin olores fuertes de fácil aplicación y mejor aun resultados en poco tiempo quito el color amarillento y la deformación recomendado a ojos cerrados
1,Not an effective product,"I used this stuff for a couple of months (two or three times a day) and saw no indication that it was having any effect whatsoever.My guess is that it is mostly denatured alcohol with a little bit of thymol in it to make it smell like it should do something.... And perhaps it would do something... The same way that rubbing alcohol would do something!In the meantime, I started using 'Thyme (red) Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.', and after two weeks... I see IT working..."
2,Amoresse Thymol,Once I started using this product there seemed to be a resurgence in the fungal infection in my toenails. I was not able to discern any odor of the product ingredients - Thymol). I ended up purchasing Thymol and 99% percent alcohol and mixing my own 4% Thymol solution which was more effective. I would not recommend this product for purchase because I am not convinced it contains the proper ingredients (in effective amounts) as listed on the label.
3,Horrible Stinch!,"This product has a strong, unpleasant smell. My guess is that the smell is from the chemical PCMX (Chloroxylenol). Even after washing the product off, you can still smell it. Maybe it works, but the smell may be too strong for you if using on a fingernail.If you do use this, be sure to not get this product anywhere near your eyes, as PCMX is a category 1 *eye irritant,* so be careful if using on fingernails that could come in contact with your eyes. Also, PCMX may possibly cause liver damage.There ""are"" other alternatives out there, but be aware that a *yeast/bacteria* nail infection, like onycholysis, is different from a *fungus* nail infection, like onychomycosis. Both require different treatments. If you can tolerate it, this product should work well for onycholysis, as it's a 4% thymol solution mixed with alcohol, which is most often recommended for onycholysis.Good luck everyone :)"
3,About like other non-prescription treatments - Mediocre,"In my particular case, thymol works about like the other non-prescription treatments for nail fungus - It retards growth somewhat, and makes it easier to clean out the debris - And works best on toenails since your feet stay much drier throughout the day."
3,"Rough, but entertaining","Two of the previous reviewers are both right about this book. It's a nice story about a woman coming to the realization of what she wants in life, namely a relationship with another woman and not her husband, and the younger woman who is waiting for the older woman to understand herself. It also needed an editor badly. This is partially a problem with the publisher she chose. First Books is a very small concern and is infamous for doing very little to polish its authors' books. There are numerous misspelled or misused words in this book and the same words and ideas are repeated too often. A good editor would have straightened out a lot of this. If you can put that aside though, and sometimes it's not easy, you can enjoy the story. And there is a somewhat humorous twist to the story. What is more humorous than two women who are trying to decide whether to accept or reject each other being stuck in the same house, in the same bed? It certainly is an interesting situation."
1,Hopeless,I was very surprised at the writing in this book--very difficult to follow because of poor grammer and syntax--I am surprised it got through the publisher--save your money --
1,Consider the Following:,"Q: What was the name people used to call ""Avant garde"" music before the 1960's?A: Awful."
5,The Sound of Vietnam Era Terror in America,"My vinyl copy of this album, purchased when I was a college sophomore, is buried in my attic or basement. But I dreamed about it the other night and woke to buy it on iTunes. And upon a new listening, forty-two years later, it remains dreamlike. Strange and difficult and lovely, it means the world to me. The world of my youthful political concerns, but also the world of all possible pain and worry, poetically captured by Hubbard and his great collaborators. I was a committed jazz fan when I first bought the album, but I had no idea what I was in for. Hearing it again so far into its future, I find it haunting and terrible and beautiful. You want no part of this album unless you already understand how something can be simultaneously beautiful and terrible. Even then, this particular blend of music, poetry, tape loops, electronics, and quotations may not be your cup of meat. I hesitate to recommend it. I love it."
5,Swiss watch,"I bought this watch for my wife when we are out on the water cruising or on the seas.It is tough, keeps accurate time and a good value for the money."
5,Tired of the Headaches? Try this Amazing new Product - Sinufix,"I only wish I had found out about Sinufix years ago. I'd complained to my cousin about my sinuses always giving me problems and about how often I get sinus infections. My cousin's sinuses and asthma are so bad that he moved to Arizona to avoid the dampness that irritates these conditions. He asked me if I had tried Sinufix and described what it was and told me how much better off he was after using it. I purchased the pills and the spray - I am VERY SATISFIED with it. It loosens and washes away everything that is clinging inside your sinus cavities. If you are perpetually stuffed, and are tired of it - try this product."
2,Jello Up the Snozz,"I was disappointed. Reviewed all the information about this one product a lot-so I felt I knew it well before it appeared in my mailbox. I have dry sinuses, but not overly dry. This mist was thick. It felt like I just sprayed Jello into my sinuses. Maybe this will help others, but my condition continues, even with this mist. I wish everyone with sinus problems the best, and pray for many solutions."
4,A Footnote In History...,The tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic continues to mesmerize people throughout the world. The story of it's tragic maiden voyage has been retold numerous times in books and on the screen. The author's grandma puts a face upon the many steerage passengers who met their death when this great ship went to her doom that dark frigid night.I feel this book is a worthwhile addition to any collection of Titanic memorabilia.
1,A big disappointment,"After paying almost [$$] for this ""fishing"" video, I put it into my VCR only to find that it has some of the most offensive content I have seen in any tape of its kind. I'm not a prude, but come on, how much sex does a fishing video really need? I suppose you could argue that it was fairly tastefully done, but I had hoped to show this video to my children ages 3 and 7 - far too young for this kind of material. As a fishing video for making babies, Mr. Behroozi is sold on ""Best Catches,"" and I suppose that Mr. Carver was really eager to ""hit the bass pond"" (don't think too much about this one, I'm warning you!) after watching the tape, but for those of us who just want to catch something rated PG, I wouldn't touch this video with a ten-foot fishing pole. Throw this one back!"
4,"work well, but more flimsy than expected","They work well, fiskars are always great, but they are more flimsy than I expected, I wonder if they will break one day when I am cutting open a hard plastic package (that's what we bought them for)............So, they are great if you want them for cutting paper and they are working ok for now for other stuff too, but they are not extremely sturdy."
2,"They do the job, but they are uncomfortable.","There's not much more to be said for scissors. They cut, but they are awkward to hold."
3,collect call not accepted,"Whilst I agree with other reviewers that Carmel McCourt has a distinctive voice with genuine jazz sensibilities, and her band play some incisive, swinging music, this compilation disappoints for being less than the sum of the parts. The Drum Is Everything and The Falling both contain a better overall set of songs. Also, the earlier albums retain a much more lean and mean approach, with less generic 80's synth-pop influence. My main gripe is that my favourite track (I'm Not Afraid Of You) is edited, or at least it's different than the album version, which leads me to wonder whether other tracks are abbreviated. It doesn't do much for listening pleasure to think that you're not hearing the real thing. However, there doesn't appear to be any other compilation of Carmel around. I would recommend the two albums mentioned above in preference to this comp, and The Drum in particular."
4,"I was a patient, too.","For those of us who have been physically impaired and/or very ill, scared to death children in adult bodies, lost in the mad world of medicine, a must read. A stinging and witty critique of being a patient from the inside out. We can feel and identify with her pain, her fatigue, her helplessness and her addiction to pain and dysfunction. Then, vertical once again and walking the world of ""healthy"" people, we can feel the fear and pain of being ""healthy"" once again and still being desperately stuck in life in general and wanting to cling to the comfort of illness and hospitals. It will mean a lot, if you've been there. Written like one who's been there and who has the gift of storytelling to spit every syllable back out in plain, human language."
5,"Painful, sexy and hilarious","I've read this book several times and each time I'm struck by it's raw power, delivered with such skilled and playful style that it is all the more effective. It is a book about illness and pain where I don't think the word ""anger"" is ever used. Alice is a girl we recognize completely but Schine has created her with a fresh perception and gentle wit that in some ways reminds me of Barbara Pym's heroines."
1,How to mock illness,"This mockery of the feelings of the patients and the hospital personnel is annoying and the writing style is boring. I have abandoned it half way, and regret to have bought it (italian edition)."
3,The pump,Got this for home use. So far so good(no leaking). Remenber match the pump brand to the syrup brand so it fits the bottle.
4,This stuff is so good!,"I use this product to add a touch of cinnamon to coffe, hot chocolate, and warm apple cider. It is amazing. I use a few products from torani's and this is everything that I expected from them."
1,Defective,I couldn't figure out why it was not working well from the day I received it. I found a large crack in the side of the pump. I am going to try to return it but it seems that if it is not sold by amazon I will not be able to exchange the product. Very disappointed!
3,Does what it says (pretty much...),"I have one of the Torani pumps and I also have one for Monin syrup bottles. The Monin works first time, everytime and is very predictable and consistently delivers a measured shot of syrup. By contrast, the Torani pump, if not used for a couple of days, will not pump any syrup for the first one or one and a half pumps. It will issue a ""pop"" sound on the first pump and will not dispense any syrup until it primes itself again.That said, once it is primed again it predictably delivers a measured shot of syrup."
4,check the ml before buying,this pump works great with Torani syrup however be aware and make sure it is for the right size. Hint 64oz is not 750ml - i don't know why they cant be consistent in their sizes. It was too big for syrup so I took some gauze and tape and taped it down. I was too lazy and wanted to use the syrup too much to return. works great even retro-fitted.
3,Good if you are a bar owner...,"This pump works great - that's not the problem. The problem is that it makes the bottle about 2 feet tall when it is inserted. That'a way too tall for your kitchen, or even in your cabinet. All I can think is that it's perfect if you have a bar, or something where you display all of your bottles. Otherwise it just looks foolish. I took mine out, and now I just pour."
1,Leaked in Shrink-Wrap and Remotes,"If you're going to use all 100 of these in short order, maybe they're OK? If they're going to set around for several months or more, forget about it! These leaked in two remotes and over half the remaining unopened ones leaked in the shrink-wrap. They were stored at normal room temperatures (as suggest for alkaline batteries).Amazon, you need to get reimbursed from your supplier and issue refunds to those of us with leaky ones!"
2,Lost Most of Them to Corrosion,"I've never had storage problems with batteries before but, over time, the unused batteries kept corroding and had to be thrown away. I have a couple dozen left and they are wrapped in paper towels to keep them from touching each other in hopes of saving them.Added later: The paper towels didn't work and I ended up trashing the remaining batteries."
2,Not a good buy for the money,"While the batteries that did not fall apart have done fine, more than 30 out of the 100 batteries have ""dissolved"" in their packaging. The printed labels wipe off in your hand and the batteries are oily and make a mess in your hand or any appliance you put them in. An additional 15 out of the 100 did not have a full 1.5V charge as they came out of the packaging. If saving money is your main objective and you want to take the risk - go ahead. Otherwise I would say spend a little more and buy another brand."
2,Don't buy these for Bose Noise Canceling Headphones!,I bought a pack of these for use in my Bose noise canceling headphones. These normally trouble free headphones were barely able to function on this particular brand. I consider these not worth the money.
1,Very poor quality,Absolutely no good for long term storage. They may be ok if you use them soon after purchasing. I bought them 5 years ago and just opened them. I don't know at what time they started to go bad but every single one of them had leaked in the package and I had to throw the whole box away.
2,You get what you pay for,I bought 100 AAA and 100 AA a few months back. I am very disappointed as they just don't last very long.I use 2 AA in one camera and 4 in another and have to change them about twice as often as a name brand battery.I use AAA in some desk clocks with temperature and a bathroom scale and experience very poor life.It was worth the try but the value is not there.
5,get it no doubts whatsoever!,Last just as long as Duracell. arrived in perfect condition! wonderful price! wont be buying batteries from anywhere else these are 100% perfect wish I woulda found out about these years ago! truely amazing for the price!
4,Problem with return policy,Nothing wrong with product problem came with return policy. I ordered the wrong size and could not exchange for the right size with out paying restocking fee.
1,Ultralst Leakage Damaged my Flashlights,I have bought several different packages of ultralasts and now have suffered my third damaged flash light. The batteries leak! My last leaking battery issue was probably 30 years ago. These batteries are made in China and have the extremely low quality of many chinese products. These batteries also (luckily for me) don't work in my other electronic devices because they have a slightly lower voltage than a regular alkaline battery.
3,Copper Stemware Holder,"I purchased this and did not install it for a few months. By the time I got it out of the packaging, it was rusty in a few places. I did install it and due to it being under the lip of the cabinet it does not show. It does what it is designed to to."
2,Pretty but not very functional,"I really liked the racks, and when I installed them on the bar shelf, they looked great. The problem is, they dont hold very many wine glasses. The opening is too small. i took them off and replaced them with some that I purchased at a wine store. They would work well for champagne glasses."
5,small openings,"Before sending for this product be sure to measure the bottoms of your wine glasses. If the wine glass has a bottom of more than 2 3/4 inches they will not fit properly. Any bottom, even 3 inches is too large. Quality seems very good and for the smaller glasses it is a great addition. Best price on Amazon!"
1,Do not buy!,"Unless you have the smallest based wine glasses. The openings are so very small, we actually had to return the holder."
5,Wow! These guys are good!,"If you like The Canadian Brass and Empire Brass, you'll like this horn quartet. They do a super job. Technically accurate, expressive, fun to listen to. Track 8 has some of the most incredible triple tounging and fast playing I've ever heard from a horn. And he's acccurate too! The recording is high quality as well (I was concerned because I had never heard of the lable before). This CD gets heavy rotation in my CD collection. I've ordered this CD as a gift for family as well. If you like brass you'll love this CD. If you play the horn, you have to have it!"
3,Mostly Solid Follow-up,"By far the most wholesome, sanitized pop group to surface out of the UK in the last few years has been the co-ed confection Steps, who rather than go for hip-hop lite and funky beats instead relish in cheesy, infectious pop music(though often compared to ABBA, that would be doing ABBA a great disservice--Steps are decent, but no ABBA). On their second stateside release, they actually do attempt to branch out slightly from the Stock Aitken Waterman-style Europop ditties, adding drum loops here and there and a slight R&B edge to some of the tracks, but not enough of a deviation from their trademark to make fellow Brits All Saints or Hear'Say lose any sleep. It's all very pleasant and inoffensive--they're actually pretty decent singers, and 'It's The Way You Make Me Feel' and the pseudo-disco tribute 'Stomp' are both keepers, with the rest of the album filled out by solid, if unspectacular, tunes. All in all, an ever-so-slight inprovement over their first record."
4,Buy the import or wait for the GOLD import,"Really, if Steps were to make a CD for the true fans, why would they take out a lot of the songs from the UK release, including ""You'll be Sorry"" one of their better songs. The new song ""Mars and Venus"" is stupid. But still you get some good worthwhile tracks. ""stomp"" is fruity yet lots of fun. ""It's The Way You Make Me Feel"" cheesy yet irresistible. ""Here and Now"" a Britney Spears ... yet it is one of the best songs of its type. ""Summer of Love"" the video was a gap video ... but it finally showed they could dance for something. Anyways, my advice is buy the import release of Buzz. 15 Tracks instead of the US's 11. Or better yet, wait til Oct.1 and import the GOLD: Greatest Hits release."
2,hmmmm..... interesting.,"I think as a pop album this is very good. personally, however, I'm a hardcore indie fan- think Elbow, BadlyDrawnBoy, Radiohead, et al. For this reason, and this reason only I give this album 2 stars. For those of you who DO like pop, then I'm sure it's great- catchy songs, high chart positions (in the UK), etc. But I could never listen to this music myself as in my opinion (everyone's is different), I would feel guilty about them being so much about image- maybe if they played the instruments that I know they can play in the songs, I could give them more credit. But aren't musicians about musical talent- hence words like MUSICianship and MUSICal instruments. This album is most definitely not about music- it's about having a good time and basically making you smile. If this is what you want from a CD, then this album is perfect. If, on the other hand, you want intellectual, thought provoking music, DON'T buy this album."
5,VERY-GOOD POP/DANCE/BALLAD ALBUM,"This is the third of the Steps albums, and sadly the last (not including Gold-The best of) as the group have now disbanded. This album seems a bit different to the two previous albums, seems a little more up-beat in a way. I would list it as maginally behind 'Steptacular', but is a very-good album with a good mixture of pop, dance and ballad songs again. The member's vocals continue to combine well on the songs. On this album Faye seems to sing more lead vocals than on the previous albums but overall Claire is used more as lead vocals on all three albums.This Australian release of 'Buzz' has 16 tracks (14 tracks plus 2 bonus tracks) and is practically the same as the imported (UK) version (15 tracks)."
3,Why Settle For Half?,"I Have Been a steps Fan Since ther first Single Release in the UK 5,6,7,8, I bought The first Album then wanted the second Steptacular, But all i could find in the US was a cd with half the tracks, and many repeats off the first UK album, So i went to Canada and bought the full version of Steptacular.Steps is a fun Band , and most singles have Dance instuctions.Id recomend Importing the Full 15 track Buzz Cd,steps are a great band. Why settle for Half?"
3,You'll hate yourself in the morning.,"Like most UK acts, Steps never caught fire in America as they did overseas. Nevertheless, this disc is a reasobaly entertaining effort with its share of cheesy moments. ""The Summer of Love"" and ""Venus and Mars"" make up a small handful of the tracks that won't actually make you cringe. Empty-headed, bubblegum teen pop that recalls Stock Aitken Waterman (Pete Waterman co-produced many of their singles). As of this writing, Steps disbanded, but their contribution to pop will remembered as, unfortunately, just another pre-fabricated group that performed catchy but formulic tunes."
5,It's true,"I needed a small square like this to fit inside small places. My biggest concern was it being truly square. When I checked this with my machinist square, it's right on the money. I got what I needed."
2,disapointing,"the book contained too many generalities ie. gunpowder development, gun fit ,. and not enough specfics concerning serial numbers and their dates of manufactuer .Very little information concerning Bertta high grade guns ie what were the predessors to the So, 5,6, and 9 when were they manufactured, and why were they discontiniued ,what were the changes? the same for other manufacturers. A great deal of the book was nothing more than a catolog available at most gun stores. the section on engraving was excellent as were the photographs. I don!t belive the book was worth the effort to assemble ,or worth the money ."
4,the only collar I'll ever used,"I've been using these collars on my lab mixes for the past 6 years. I am only on my third set of collars and still use my original leashes and harnesses. I was a little disappointed that the metal clasp has been replaced with plastic, but the quality of the collar is still very good. I would recommend Planet Dog products to anyone, especially the leases because the handle is so soft (my dogs like to pull)."
4,Very nice sturdy collar,"This collar is nice, thick material. I have no doubts my puppy will be using it for awhile. It's really soft on him and he doesn't scratch at it much.The only reason i knock it down a star is because one of the metal pieces on the collar had a sharp piece on it from manufacturing. If left unattended, it could have cut my puppy. I filed it down and it's as good as new. Other than this issue, really nice collar."
3,1 Design Flaw,"Overall this collar is a good concept. Nice fuzzy fleece next to your dog's neck. However, since my dog needed a size large and is in the smaller range (but too big for medium), most of the collar was folded over on itself and only a very small portion of the fleece was exposed to be against my dog's neck. Since my dog is done growing, I cut the collar and re-sewed it to make it only for his neck. Now there is lots of fleece against his neck and it seems like his neck irritation has been reduced."
2,"Buckle Sucks, Not recommended for bigger dogs",The size was fine my dog is 30lbs and got a medium size but this collar lasted only a few days my dog got it off repeatedly just when scratching his neck. The buckle is not secure enough it pulls right apart. It looked very comfortable on him but it definitely needs a stronger buckle for medium and large sizes. Wouldn't recommend for bigger dogs.
4,Nice collar,"I bought one of these collars for my dog because his original collar was too large. This collar is quite soft and my dog seems to like it. I have not observed any irritation or other problems from this collar, though I never saw any problems with his old collar.Unlike some other collars I've tried with nylon straps, the plastic clasp does not slip.I've had the collar for several months and it is holding up well. It seems better about not loosening up unlike some other collars I've tried on my active dog."
4,Bulky collar,"These are cute, lined w/shearling and made from hemp which is why I ordered one. My dog's neck is exactly 12"" and so I ordered the medium (up rather than down for extra room, right?). Well, the collar arrived, cute as I'd hoped but in order to make it fit her neck it's almost halved so that it's really bulky looking and feeling--not good. She'd already worn it a few times so I haven't contacted the seller about returning it. Will post again if I do. If you're dog is on the cusp of the collar measurements, you may want to reconsider."
2,This collar is sooo lame!,"There is a serious design flaw with this collar. Since they do not offer a small in the fleece lined collar, I ordered a medium which says it will fit my dog's 12 inch neck size. The collar is sooooo huge it could fit an elephant and if made small enough to fit the dogs neck, there is no fleece even touching him, it's sooo stupid. So, I do like the look of the collar and the fleece is soft, that I decided to cut the collar to my dogs size and sew it. The buckle is really big and made out of cheap plastic!!!! I don't understand why they dont offer more sizes considering the point of this collar is to have the ""COZY FLEECE"" against your dog's neck. I have no idea why I kept this collar to be honest, it was a waste of money!"
3,"Stopped the hair rubbing off, but cheap buckle","Nylon collars were rubbing the hair off my dog, switching to this collar made a big difference in that, however the buckle is a cheap plastic and I worry about it breaking while walking my dog. If the buckle was metal or a much heavier duty plastic I would give it 5 stars."
4,good collar,"Bought this for my new puppy. I love the hemp leash especially - very soft on the hands. The collar is cute, quite thick though, my daughter thought it should be a winter-only collar. But it's holding up well and I like the look. We go to the beach a lot and it does hold water and sand more than a webbing-type collar. But otherwise I'm pleased."
2,Comfy but flimsy,"I was looking for a comfortable collar for my dog, and selected this one after reading the reviews. First the collar is plush feeling and soft, however it's bulky and at first glance the latch does not look sturdy. How true this turned out to be. On a walk with very little tension on the leash, the latch un-hinged and the collar release from around my dogs neck. Good thing I have a dog that is always right by my side, and wouldn't bolt out into the street. This item is bulky and flimsy, and I will be returning for a refund."
3,"Fastener is Plastic, Not Stainless Steel","In the image of the product, one can see the fastener is black. Upon confirming at the Planet Dog website, the fastener is plastic, not stainless steel as advertised in the product description."
2,"Cheaply Made, Do Not Recommend","I got this collar in blue for my puppy last October. The soft fleece is really nice, but that's the only good thing I can say about this collar. The blue dye started to fade immediately and is now just a dingy pale blue one year later. The fabric frays too, I find myself clipping stray threads weekly. I'm just glad the cheap plastic buckle hasn't fallen apart, but it probably would if my dog continues to wear this for much longer.Save your money for something that will last! Hippies beware!"
2,"cozy yes, but it doesn't stay on.","This is probably a very comfortable collar. I say only probably because it is quite thick and though the dog doesn't seem to mind, it looks to me what it would feel like if I was wearing a thick scarf wrapped around my neck all the time.But that aside, what I really don't like is that between yesterday when the collar finally went on his neck to this morning, it has already fallen off once. The clasp is just too easy to push, and when the two dogs wrestle - as they do a lot! - one stray paw push was enough to unclasp the collar. That's just not acceptable."
2,planet dog cozy collar,"I bought this so my dog would have the cozy side next to his neck. Well, this collar is grossly mis-sized, to the point where by the time I adjust it to fit him the cozy side is no longer next to his neck.Also it was supposed to have a chrome clasp and arrived with a plastic clasp.Nice collar otherwise Just be careful with sizing. I have a large breed dog and the large was too big for him."
4,Planet Dog Cozy Hemp Adjustable Collar,"Love the apple green color. I am concerned because the collar became unbuckled one time already within the first month of use. I hope it was a one time occurrence, because what is the point of having a collar with a name tag on it if the won't stay on the dog?"
1,I had to have my dog Put Down...,"Because of the plastic piece that holds the collar clasp together snapped, my dog broke her collar while she was on the yard leash. She then attacked another dog and by city regulations had to be put down. I spent money, time, and energy on this animal for a faulty piece of equipment to be the cause of her death. I don't get it. You have a metal piece for hook up the leashes too. why not take the extra time to make all the pieces metal to secure the collar. You guys will never get another penny from me and I will never endorse anything again from this company. Good day to you Sirs and Mams."
1,Metal clasps?,"From the info I read, I understood that the small collars were the only ones with plastic clasps, and the mediums and larges had a heavier duty metal clasp. I ordered a medium for my 35 lb basenji and a large for my 80 lb german shepard mix. They are both VERY hard on their collars, and I don't even like to get them adjustable collars because they break too easy, but I thought the metal might be tough enough, at least for a while. I was so mad when I opened the wastefully huge box Amazon sent the collars in (which was damaged) and realized that there were two collars with wimpy plastic clasps. I am very disappointed and I can't even find a phone number to call and complain!"
2,Was sent the wrong size,"I ordered a large collar, but was sent a medium, which at it's longest is 19"". Here it is I thought I underestimated the size of my dog's neck as opposed to actually measuring the size of the collar. I guess that's what I get for trusting the vendor. My poor dog has been suffering a very snug collar for the last five months because I thought it was my fault! I won't order again from this vendor, but on a positive note, the hemp collar is soft and less bothersome than vinyl, plastic or leather."
2,too bulky,this collar is too bulky for my small french bulldog. I do like that it is soft and the colors are nice.
2,Not The Worst Album Ever Made,"At the time this album came out it was mercilessly slammed by everybody, but the expectations on any new Dylan album would have to be pretty high after he had raised the bar again and again on making classic albums. This is just an album of a guy with a raspy voice singing some of his favorite songs along with some originals that he probably didn't have to take too long to write. Did it have to be a double album? Was he trying to break his contract? Not the worst album ever made, by any long shot, but worth at least a listen for any Dylan fan interested in where his head was at at the time."
4,Absolutely Hilarious,"Anyone who doubts this albums farcial value, AFTER ignoring the cover, and AFTER ignoring the appropriate placement of the song I've Forgotten More Than You'll Ever Know, and AFTER realizing the time in Dylan's career was ripe for some light hearted parody needs to look no further than Dylan's recording of Paul Simon's The Boxer. While overdubbing his voice, a la Simon and Garfunkel, and making no attempt to syncrhonize the vocal tracks, the albums funniest gag hits you right between the eyes. On one vocal track, Simon sings ""the quiet of the railway station"". Overdubbing himself, he sings ""the quiet of the RAILROAD station. Once again, proof of Bob's acerbic sense of humor."
1,What happened?,"For all the brilliance of Bob Dylan in the 60's, this may have been his first major misstep. This album has nothing to boast of save Days of 49, a rocker with raw energy and gritty style. Unsuspecting Dylan fans beware. Check out Highway 61 Revisted, Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks and Bringing It All Back Home instead. That's my two cents."
1,One of the worst albums ever,"What was the event that told us the '60s were really over? Was it the election of Richard Nixon? The Kent State murders? Or was it 1970's Self Portrait? The first song, in which Bob doesn't even bother to make an appearance, consists entirely of women singing the phrase ""All the tired horses in the sun / How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done?""--14 friggin' times. Incredibly, unthinkably, it goes downhill from there. Pick your own favorite low point: Ours is the cover of Gordon Lightfoot's ""Early Morning Rain."""
2,Unusual album,"This record differs from other Dylan ones in that, sadly, it is boring. Some of his records are great. Some of them very good. There are some mediocre ones. And only a few turkeys. Among the latter, most of them are just bad ones (weak songs, lousy musicians, poor production values). This is his only boring one."
3,A Mixed Blessing,"I have kept from getting this CD because of the negative reviews it has had for 40 years.However I finally got it and found there are indeed some really awful tracks such as The Boxer and All The Tired Horses and a few other very ordinary tracks.However there are some extremely brilliant tracks such as my fav It Hurts Me Too.Copper Kettle & Days Of 49 are some other great Dylan songs.Self Portrait contains Blues, Country, Gospel and folk music and even 4 'Live' tracks from Isle Of Wight 1969.There are other hidden gems that deserve listening to.I prefer this CD to another recorded at the same time New Morning.Give it a go and enjoy some great Bob songs."
1,Sucky-poo,"I'm listening to this album for the first time right now. I came to Amazon.com to see what other people have rated this album, and am surprised that some people gave it 5 stars! After reading some comments, one person said it took several years to like it! I'm not going to wait that long, so I'll just give it 1 lousy star. Look, here's a clue about how to recognize bad music: when the artists starts singing ""la la la"" like in the song Wigwam, that's a good indication that the song is NOT FININSHED YET!"
5,Bob's Best Work,"I'm sure this is going to stir debate, since he has so many incredible works, but IMHO, this is his best. A blend of old, Bobby, new Bobby and coming Bobby. ""All the Tired Horses"" has rattled around in my brain for 20 years. There is not one song on this album that is not platinum quality. The title alone should tell you what Bob thought of the work. Whether you agree that it is the best or not, enjoy!"
1,Bob's worst album,"Lately there's been a lot of revisionism concerning this album, with many fans coming out of the closet and confessing admiration, but I have never revised my opinion after all these years. It's still as bad as I knew it to be when it was first released. Maybe today it can be appreciated as a novelty item, but coming as it did after a series of masterpieces like ""Highway 61 Revisited"" and ""Blonde on Blonde"", it was tremendously disappointing. All the revisionism in the world will never cover up the fact that there is nothing more to this album than scraps of failed attempts to produce an album of covers, most of which are truly awful."
4,Dylan Folows His Own Muse,"Self Portrait is one of the most eclectic and unusual albums in the Bob Dylan catalog. Originally released as a double album in 1970, the album contains originals, covers, live recordings and versions of his own songs made famous by others. The album doesn't contain any real definitive songs, but the album's premise shows that Bob Dylan is his own man and doesn't bow to any pressures around him. At the time, people where clamoring for Mr. Dylan to re-establish himself as the voice of his generation and comment on the political unrest of the times. Mr. Dylan just followed his own muse and the results are unspectacular, but pleasant. His covers versions of ""The Boxer"", ""Early Mornin' Rain"" and ""Blue Moon"" are worth repeated listens as his version of his own ""The Mighty Quinn"". ""All The Tired Horses"" and ""Days Of '49"" are great songs. Self Portrait is an essential Bob Dylan album, but it is definitely one of his most interesting."
2,Frighteningly bad,Dylan has produced so many albums that he is allowed a few bad ones. This is one of those. It sounds like he didn't give a damn when he made this one. Only for collectors.
1,Ouch...,"Don't get me wrong, Bob is, quite simply, The Man. But nobody's perfect.In my mind, Dylan was kinda drifting from after the bike accident until Blood on the Tracks. He had sorta lost it, I guess. When you consider the best Dylan could offer during this period was mediocrity, especially after putting out SIX awesome discs in a row (Freewheelin'; Times They Are a-Changin'; Another Side of; Bringing It All Back Home; Highway Sixty-One Revisited; Blonde on Blonde) is disenheartening. To make things even worse, there are two good songs on this album, out of 24, no less. Quinn the Eskimo is the obvious highlight, plus It Hurts Me Too is a good blues cover. Then there are some of Bob's WORST SONGS EVER. Little Sadie; Take a Message to Mary; All the Tired Horses; I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know, The Boxer, Copper Kettle... you name it. Bob's put out mostly good music, with emphasis on ""mostly"". This is NOT an example."
1,What you have heard is true...,"There are as many reasons to speculate as to why this album is so bad as there are people speculating. One thing is certain though... They are right. Dylan is a genius. One of the top 10 most influential musicians to be produced by America in the 20th Century. But, in this case, the emperor is naked. And there is no excuse. Save your money. Or burn it. At least the pain will be over sooner."
3,Liked It Better Before,"I remember loving this album when it first came out (vinyl) but listening to it now.....well, I still like some of it, but overall am not as enthusiastic about it. I guess it's better to let some things from the past alone!"
4,easy going country album,"Come on CBS - when is this underrated album going to be remastered? Sure there are some numbers you could leave off, but there are also very many that are good, easy-listening country songs. The feel, music and voice on this album make it worthy of an upgrade."
3,"Half dross, half interesting","I can't work out why Nashville Skyline is praised while this one is criticised. I guess it it because of the absolute dross that Dylan put on this album - Woogie Boogie, Blue Moon, The Boxer, Take Me As I Am (Or Let Me Go), Wigwam and Alberta #2.The next group up are 'interesting' live versions of Dylan classics and some poor to ok songs.But the real treat with this album are the ones that would not be considered Dylan classics but are very good and otherwise virtually unheard because of the reputation of this album - Days of 49, Early Morning Rain, In Search Of Little Sadie, Let It Be Me, Living The Blues, Copper Kettle, Gotta Travel On, Take A Message To Mary and It Hurts Me Too.This album is only for Dylan fans."
4,good CD,"this is one of Dylan most collectible works. if I understood them right, that this was the album they were buying, and what they say they can sell it for. Pawn Stars was trying to get 75.00 for it. somebody may get screwed on that price. this is why I usually check out 2 on-line sites 1st. Amazon is one of them. amazon is a much better source for a lot of stuff. this CD is good, but it can be had for much much less than even close to 75.00 Las-vegas? try on-line. this is a good CD and readily available. a good recording."
5,I want to marry my baggallini,"Love this product. It is cool looking, lightweight, and has the versatility of being either a shoulder bag or a backpack. I was worried at first that I wouldn't have enough room for all the junk I cart around: WRONG! Fits perfectly (and what I've had to economize, I didn't need anyway!). Love the groovalicious green. Before buying on Amazon checked to see if retailers carried the Urban Backpack in our local stores. No one did: their loss. This is a great bag. I want to marry it, hug it and. . . okay, just hug it."
5,Great transaction!,"The Baggallini Urban Backpack, Khaki was as described. My purchase arrived before stated delivery date. Best price found through Amazon!"
4,Love this bag!,"I love my Baggallini bag so much I bought two. I have been using it daily for over a year and it shows no wear. I have an old-fashioned clasp wallet that is almost square, a compact camera, two check books, pens, flash drive, keys, small hairbrush, and a cell phone in my purse, and it all fits nicely. I give it a four only because the straps are not adjustable. People are always asking me about my bag. It is simple and light and looks elegant."
1,clasp defect... beware!,"In less than 3 months of light use, the clasp/hook on one side of my bag broke. I could re-hook it but it came undone with the slightest movement or pressure. When I contacted the company directly, they sent me a new bag. Of course, I had to pay for shipping but at least I have a new, more importantly, USEABLE bag. I like the bag very much and hope that I have better luck with this new one.Now, after less than six months, the clasp is coming apart again. I will NOT re-send to the company but wish I had saved my money and never purchased the bag. It is such a cute concept but has a flawed design."
1,Strap attachment ripped off in less than 90 days,I think this bag is great to look at. A little more dressy than clunky school days and hiker backpacks. I never stuffed it full. After using it for a total of 35 days traveling one of the strap attachment points ripped apart at the stitching. No longer can function as a backpack.
2,Strap Broke After Only 9 Months of Use,I asked for this bag for Christmas last year. I didn't use the interior credit card and checkbook pockets and found them annoying when I tried to find a pen at the bottom of the bag. The bag doesn't sit up well and falls over. After only 9 months of everyday use one of the straps is broken at bottom. I'm really disappointed.
5,Baggallini Urban Backpack,"This is the second Baggallini backpack I have purchased. It is just the right size and weight. It holds up well. i like the slots for the cards i carry for insurances, so I can ditch the big wallet. It opens up wide for easy access to the inside. I like how it stands upright on a counter."
4,Color not as vivid as in the photo,"I'm generally quite happy with this bag, but was a little disappointed over the colour. I bought the charcoal colour bag, which turned out to look a little faded/ used. Not quite the same as how it looked in the photo. The handles were also a little stiff, however I believe that with increased use they will soften. It would have been good if the shoulder straps were adjustable. I'm 5'2"" and the bag sits in the middle of my bum. I'd have preferred it to sit higher but that couldn't be done.I love the fact that there are lots of compartments inside the bag, which allows me to organise my things much better. Overall, the product is described to the letter."
2,Wears out in less tha six months.,"Well, maybe you are the type of person who buys a bag for every occasion and you don't need your bag to last very long, but I am not that wealthy. I wear a back pack purse everyday to work or play and I need it to last at least six months. This bag is wearing out. The fabric on the bottom corners is frayed and you can now see the white liner showing through. Also the zippers seldom stay closed at the bottom of the bag. The bottom of the zippers usually rip open on their own about an inch from the bottom. There is an inner lining that keeps things from falling out, but it is annoying. It is light weight which is great, but I am not happy that it is wearing out so quickly."
3,Great travel bag except...,"I bought this bag to use on a five week trip to FL. I wanted a bag that looked good enough for any occasion but converted to a backpack when I was more active. This bag was great except when I warmed up and began perspiring, the dye from the zipper rubbed off on my clothing. I do like the security of the zippers and the magnetic clasp at the top. Be careful though...I laid my bag down to put on my jacket on a restaurant table where we had just ate dinner. I was very surprised when we got back to the room and I found a fork stuck to the front of my bag! The magnetic clasp is very strong!"
3,Beware: the lining gets caught in the zipper,"I've had my Baggallini Urban Backpack for a few months now, and overall it's a stylish, practical bag, as mentioned by many reviewers. I have had a repeated issue, however: the lining in the zippered compartment in the back (there's one that faces front (as you can see in the photo), as well as one that faces back) has loosened, and it gets caught in the zipper. It's really a pain to try to get the lining unstuck, and I can't move the zipper up or down until I do so. I try to be really careful to make sure the lining is taut before I zip it, but about once a week it still gets stuck. Super-annoying."
2,Why the new 'twists'...?,"* Spoiler alert (I guess) *If you're expecting this to have a setting within ancient times, you're in for a disappointing surprise; when the freed prisoner emerges from the cave, he does so into a modern park--complete with cars...power transformers...buildings...joggers. Couldn't the filmmakers have gone to an unpopulated area to film this part? I realize that they used artistic license to insert this little `modern twist' into things, but it really wrecked the whole thing for me...Also, the people in the cave were shown drinking what were apparently bottles of alcohol (???); not sure why that was necessary either..."
1,Allegory of the Cave Not Worth the Money,"While the professor's discussion of Plato's Allegory of the Cave was informative, it was like listening to a college lecture. The video example of Allegory was amateurish. The examples I found on YouTube created by college students were much more interesting....and FREE!"
2,Didn't work for me,"bought these for use on concrete block wall. They were easy enough to drive into the block, but pins apparently aren't long enough to prevent chipping of the block and falling out. They may work in other applications, but i was disappointed."
3,Great story marred by bad reading,"First of all, let me say up front that ""Comes a Horseman"" is a great story. The pace is well set, though the procedural parts seem to drag a little at times going into too much detail. The problem with this audio book is the horrible job of the reader. Most readers of audiobooks understand the importance of giving each character at least a slight variation in voice so as to bring the book to life for us. In CAH, the reader keeps the same monotone voice for every single character. Young or old, male or female, Japanese, Italian, or American, everyone sounds the same. It's really sad at one point when the person speaking is described as having a baritone voice...yet the reader never changes in the least. When several characters are conversing at once, it's nearly impossible to tell them apart. It's too bad that Westbow would spend so much money promoting this book and then do such an unprofessional job on the audio treatment of it."
5,it supplemented my view that the computer is the minds helpe,I feel a computer helps humans to consider more complex ideas and that it is an adjunct to the human mind. I don't believe in AI. This book and Mr Hogan's comments support me in that. It is thoroughly enjoyable and written in an interested reader's level and not too Hi-tech.
3,Knot Interested,"This book is well written for the beginner, with photos accompanyng each of the knots. Some of the more difficult knots are hard to follow but with practice and a bit of experience with the technical terms I'm sure they would become easier. I particularly enjoyed the section on mats and decorative knots."
4,Words about fly-fishing...,"While true, they are seldom adequate...This is a good book but many of the characters didn't transfer properly. Tine instead of line"
3,hard to take,"This movie was a wake up call on how easy people, people of different ages and stations of life can be manipulated. It turned, my stomach."
1,Do yourself a favor and do NOT comply,"If you're in the mood for a tedious and most graphic display of human stupidity, then here is a movie for you! Anyone who has been sufficiently exposed to the general public doesn't need to be reminded by the disclaimer that this film was inspired by actual events in order to believe that yes, people really CAN be that stupid. Spending the better part of 90 minutes getting beaten over the head most relentlessly and artlessly with that point wasn't exactly my idea of a good time, but perhaps someone out there might actually enjoy it. This movie is very much an answer to a question that nobody asked. What was the point? It wasn't entertaining, nor was it thought provoking. The only thoughts it provked in me were ones of disgust and contempt. I truly regret wasting my time watching this sordid piece of trash, and would encourage others to avoid making the same mistake."
4,Compliance Movie,This is one interesting movie! If it was not a true story I would of shut it off because I thought nobody would do the things portrayed in the movie but I kept watching! I had to go to the internet afterwards to see if it was really true and it is! Very interesting and thought provoking on what you may of allowed or done at an early age.
2,"This is clearly before the age of Facebook, Twitter...etc","There is no way on God's green earth that this would have happened that many time w/out the planet finding out about it with in the hour thanks to instant everything!! She would have been a status, a tweet and definitely all over instagram if that was going down in a McDonalds today. I refuse to believe that there are so many cow like people in management that can't think for themselves and just do what their told no matter what. This has to be the worst game of Simon Says ever!!!"
3,A Taut Indi Docu-Drama,"The film title says it all: Compliance.It means that people often tend to succumb to orders from authority or authority figures under stressful conditions overtheir own judgements or common sense.This story of this film certainly stretched to its limits.The writer/director of this film claimed that this film was ""inspired by true events""(NOT ""based on true events"").The result is a taut human drama happened in a small fast food restaurant somewhere in Ohio.The premise is simple, but the writer/director managed to spin out a compelling drama on the subject matterwith a fine cast.However the going ons got relentless and maddening to the point of defying believability towards the end.This is unfortunate since it is a well-meaning and well-made film.Still it is worthwhile to view on a small screen."
4,wow,unbelieveable true story well documented. only wish they gave more info on what the consequences were for culprits.loved this eye opener
3,Not sure if true.,While watching this movie I realized that many people might comply with requests from someone on a phone but not really sure they would go this far. Does make you think.
2,Very poor entertainment,"A complete waste of time. It would have been more interesting to watch grass grow. Find a more entertaining movie. Don't know who was the dumbest, the waitress or the victim of the hoax. Dumb dumb dumb."
1,gratuitous sexual deviance,"I could find no valid reason to produce this film, other than to satisfy morbid curiousity and deviant voyuerism. I refuse to believe that anyone could be as niave as the manager.I'm sure that who ever has perpetrated these crimes is glorying in his infamy."
2,silly story line,the story was just silly and not that interesting. taking direction over the phone to search an employee just because the person claims to be the police.
1,Stupid movie.....,... about stupid people. The story claims to be based on true stories but I will be honest it is so farfetched that it boggles the mind. Dont waste your time with this even if it is free for prime members.
1,Worst ever!!,I knew it was a fake phone call at the very first call. No logic. Director must have never works in a fast food before.
1,Aweful,This was like some fantasy movie made by teenagers on a budget of ZERO. Most of the movie took place in a back room of a fast food joint.
2,Compliance,"I find it hard to believe that anyone could be as stupid as the boss lady at this restaurant and the man she was engaged to. When the pretend Officer Daniels told him to do some of the things he did to the girl, he had to know the officer was a fake and did nothing about it. Cheap movie, cheap setting, and a really dumb plot. Why any critics would lend their support to this film amazes me."
1,So Dang Stupid,"True events or not, nobody can expect us to believe there can be this many stupid people in one small location......I can't believe I even watched 60 minutes of this."
4,Good study of mental conditioning,This was a moving and very disturbing study of how good people can be manipulated by an alleged authority figure.
2,Really??,"I couldn't even finish watching this video. The manager and assistant manager should be charged with felony ignorance. Unless you are into really bad films, let this one pass by."
3,Stranger than Fiction,"This was a bizarre movie. Most bizarre part is its based on a true story. I remember when the actual events happened and remember how puzzling it was even then. It didn't seem possible anyone could fall for this ""prank call"" scenario. The movie had a dark and bleak feel to it and I think I was just too creeped out at the craziness of this REALLY happening to even notice if the actors were any good in it. If you are in the mood to feel icky, then this is for you. I WISH I could say this film was just a ""stereotyping"" commentary of fast food workers having lower levels of education and common sense than others but its even creepier this stuff REALLY happened, and not giving anything away I add at the end of the film a blurb states this actually happened in THIRTY states in our county. So unfathomable that so many people fell for this prank."
2,Goes against reality,I felt that the phone conversation between the manager and the pjolice was not realistic and should have been termiinated at the beginning.
1,Terrible,"This movie is terrible. I knew it wasn't going to be an action flick or anything like that but it just drags on and on with no real pay off. I've casually read more ""chilling stories"" on the internet. The guy's voice is actually pretty annoying so the movie isn't even passable as background noise."
2,Ludicrous!,"The movie was just stupid to me, not believable and very predictable. Who would take orders from some unknown person claiming to be a cop on the phone? No one with half a brain."
3,Compliance,"Acting is good all around. Plot seems unbelievable, but turns out to be based on fact. Terse, low budget, drama."
2,Compliance,Not worth the time to watch it.Don't even bother watching.A compleat waste of time.Stupid !!!!!What more can you say.
2,"Hard to watch, Hard to Believe","While I have to give the movie credit for being different, that doesn't make it good. The concept was different, but hardly believable. I have a very difficult time believing anyone could be so gullible. The fact that nothing was questioned by any of them is certainly suspicious - I know I would have been asking questions. The young girl, the victim/thief, is the only one I could possibly forgive for being so naive; the adults...I'm not buying it. The acting was rather dry and boring, and none of the characters were even likable, so you sort of go through the entire film not really caring about any of them. Odd little movie."
1,"Poorly done, wooden","Wanted to like this indie film, based on the reviews, but it looks bad (appears to have been shot in video in some generic suburb that's never identified but is probably in Canada), acting is wooden, dialogue ridiculous, situations unrealistic and not believable, even if ""based on true incidents."" To be fair, couldn't get past the first 40 minutes or so. Turned it off after the fast-food restaurant mgr tells the alleged copy on the phone that their corporate policy is to have two supervisors present at the restaurant when they strip-search an employee. Really??"
1,Horrible,"The girl did fine with what they gave her but horrible script, drawn out, i also watched 10 min and then skipped through and by the end they hadnt gotten anywhere, unfortunatly people are that stupid, that the scary part ,Ewiz"
2,Not worth it.,Really kind of stupid. Can't believe that many people were duped by that guy. Small town people are not that dumb!
1,Painful to watch,"Unfathomably stupid. Hard to imagine it's based on a true story, and that there are people that really are this stupid in the world.The only reason I watched the whole thing is I was watching it with someone else."
1,"Terrible acting, terrible screenplay","Terrible acting, terrible screenplay. You can get the general idea of the story doing a simple web search. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Compliance,I'm not sure what was worse: the frustration and stupidity of the characters or the perversity of the situation. Couldn't finish
1,The preview IS the entire movie,"Do not waste your time. The movie isn't anything more than the preview. It is a long, drawn out public service message."
2,DO YOU HAVE WALTER RALEIGH IN A CAN?,"The era of crank phone calls has sure taken a twist. When fast food restaurant manager (Ann Dowd) gets a phone call from someone identifying himself as policeman, she springs into action. Young Becky is accused of stealing from a customer. The assistance of the manager and others in this matter grows until it becomes inane. The film brings light to the problem of serial strip search crank calls...something I didn't know existed but sounds like it would make for a fun date.The film acting was okay. There is a high perv factor whenever you force a young girl to be stripped searched. Unfortunately this is pretty much the entire film as there is no real subplot to entertain us. This is one of those pervert films masquerading as something that makes a statement such as ""Shame."" Watch it. Enjoy it. Disturbing? Thought provoking? Oh Please. It's soft core sneaking into mainstream.Parental Guidance: F-bombs, nudity (Dreama Walker)."
1,Incredibly Stupid... Don't Waste Your Time,"Understand that this is ""based on a true story"" but honestly, who cares? The film certainly doesn't make you care - there is absolutely nothing redeeming about it. Do not waste your time if you already know that there are sad, uneducated sheep in this world who have been conditioned to follow any rando claiming to have authority."
3,prank calls,Some people can be fooled easily by supposed authority figures. We said it could not happen to us. Maybe not to this extent.
1,"This is pure garbage, and an insult to anyone with an IQ. above 40",Does NOT deserve even one star MINUS 20 stars would be to high... It smells like (%&#$)....BAD BAD BAD MOVIE.
3,I don't know how to rate this,"I mean really...I just can't believe that this actually happened. I know it may be a somewhat stretch of the truth, but my goodness, where is common sense. I mean even book smart sense should have taken some type of stance. The way the movie was constructed was good. It told a story, but knowing that people can be this retarded is amazing to me. I would have said take me to jail!"
1,Compliance,"Starts out ok, but like 30 minutes in your thinking what manager of a fast food place would be that stupid to really believe the stuff the guy on the phone is saying, you'd have to be a real idiot, just ridiculous, 2 BIG thumbs down. As the late great gene siskel would say."
2,What the...,"Who would fall for this. This is sad and hard to believe it happens. @ what point do you say ""$&#! you"" This was sad"
2,Pretty bad movie,"Even though one of the female characters was nominated for an Independent Film Award, the story behind this was unbelievable. Could people be this dumb as depicted in this film??"
1,Horrible,"Not worth your time. We didn't finish watching it, it was that bad. No real plot, horrible acting, and super slow pace."
2,I can't believe that this happened,"Watch and learn - are we really a country of naive people?The movie was good, but the stupidity of the characters made me angry. My rating maybe unfair because the acting was OK but the story made me get up and leave in exasperation with some of the characters actions.Worth a watch so you don't fall victim to this type of situation."
2,gave up,didn't take long to know this isn't for us. what's with all the language going on in movies? not worth listening
3,Really???,Says this happened in a few areas. I can't believe that this really happened or that there are seriously stupid people out there that let this happen. Didn't drag on though; got right to the point.
3,wow,"i watched the start of this film and then as it got more dumb and dumb i was just listening to it while sorting my dvd collection. At the store i work at, i get a lot of prank calls and i always hang up unless i'm in the mood to mess with them, but this was just insane at how dumb these people are. How they could not understand it was a prank is beyond me. Especially near the end. It's interesting to see how they all react as the prank gets deeper bust still.. a movie you have to shake your head at."
1,Completely Trash,Anyone who would do such a thing should not be in management. Surely nobody would make such an ignorant mistake.Totally unbelievable.
1,The hieght of absurdity,"This ""movie"" is pathetic. Is there really anyone dumb enough to go along with a so-called police officer to such an extent? If so I have never met such a person.An unspeakably moronic film."
1,This Was a Law & Order SVU episode with Robin Williams....,"Uh, I get this was also inspired by a real event but....Law & Order: SVU definitely hit on this over what 2-3 seasons ago.......Plus they had Robin Williams sooooo, there is no contest...I'd really rather sit through a 45 min prime time soapie with Williams than this...at least I cared while watching Law & Order..."
3,Compliance,"It was good, supposedly a true story. Worth watching once. A case of what not to do, both sides of the story"
4,Disturbing on so many levels,"As Im watching this movie, Im screaming and shaking my head, this can't be happening! The strip search, then when the boyfriend comes in I couln't take it anymore I had to fastforward past that part, Im talking out loud saying, this can't be true, no one could possibly be this stupid and aptly put as the title COMPLIENT (well Compliance). In what world does the police take the time to call you and ask you to search a persons personal property and then strip search them. I was just shocked and amazed, through the entire movie. I wanted to turn it off, but I coudn't I had to see then end. Very thought provoking and disturbing on so many levels."
4,Following authority figure blindly,"NEVER believe what a supposed authority figure, in this case a supposed policeman, tells you on the phone. Well done film about just such a case in recent times that not only happened once but serveral times! The story follows the events in the course of one day. It unfolds with situations and characters that make it seem possible that such a thing would actually happen. The manager of a fast food place is convinced that she is complying with the police in forcing a female employee to remove her clothes. It shows that well-intentioned people can be led into very damaging situations. The actors were not only good, they had me believing this was happening at the time. There is nudity."
3,Compliance,A true reenactment of an unbelievable event that apparently has occurred several other times in various places. Interesting movie worth viewing.
4,great blu ray,"Dreama Walker is great throughout this movie. It is a bit of a weird theme, but she makes it great."
5,Wonderful product!!!,"I've been using BaaBaaQ's for many years, we found it while living in San Diego. We had two Lhasa Apso's then and they both loved their Baabaa's which made them a really good training tool. We now have a Shih Tzu and he loves them too."
1,So-far - it doesn't work,So far I have tried the Skip Dr. on two DVDs. I followed instructions and retried cleaning when it didn't work the first time. Neither worked. I will keep trying as I run across bad DVDs.
4,Skip DR. Scratch Repair System Worth its weight in DVD's!,"It's small, it is compact, and it very simple to use. Because of it I have literally saved about 100 of my Kid's DVD's and Video Games that we thought were ruined, and a few of our own movies that were ""borrowed - but not well taken care of by our ""adult"" children and or friends.Do yourself a favor. Invest in one of these and save yourself some money and headaches. Sometimes the VERY WORST can not be saved, but so far all but one of our DVD's has been brought back to life.Highly recommended."
1,Disc Repair???,"I purchased this system about 6 months ago and it never worked right from the beginning. It scratched my discs terribly, even when I tried applying extra solution. Extremely hard to buff the discs with cloth given. After about 1 month of use the system began to just keep spinning the disc, resulting in even more damage. Not recommended at all. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars for the Maxell disc repair system."
4,Excellent disc repair tool!,"This disc repair tool worked fantastically for my CDs and DVDs. So far I have used it on 3 CDs and repaired 2 of them completely and the third I knew was probably too damaged to be repaired. Both DVDs used to skip or freeze in the middle of the movie, but both are now completely repaired. I would have given this tool 5 stars, but it doesn't come with an AC adapter. And I will tell you that it makes a huge difference when using the AC adapter instead of the AA batteries. This tool says that it works with game discs as well but I don't have any damaged game discs to try it on."
3,"Inexpensive, but does the job","So far, this seems to work well. It creates swirls on the disc surface, but that doesn't appear to affect the playability. My son was very happy to be able to play a game that wasn't working, due to scratches."
4,Works Great. Fast and neat.,This Item worked great i repaired a few discs with this. It saved me from having to buy new copies of several games.
2,Terrible on Games,"I have many consoles, but mainly use my XBOX 360. After 2 days of playing a game disc, it stopped functioning. My first thought was to use toothpaste, which worked.After one more day, it stopped working for good. I decided to purchase a SkipDr. to fix it, hoping it would work. When I got home, I followed the instructions carefully to clean my disc. After putting it in the XBOX, it did not work.I thought the disc was unrepairable, so I cleaned a perfectly fine disc for the XBOX. That disc is unusable now, also. As it turns out, it broke my entire XBOX 360 console.I wanted to find out if it was a SkipDr. defect, so I tried a DVD. The DVD worked fine, to my surprise.I have tried every trick in the book, but cannot repair those discs. This is a great product for DVDs, but a terrible choice for gaming discs."
1,IT STARTED SMOKING AFTER TWO USES!,"I tested this on my dvd. because, it will not play. I put my game in this and it started smoking did more damage then good. if I was buying a sander. I would buy this. however, I didn't need somthing that does damage more like an aide to my disc. now I am out six-ty bucks! you've been warned."
3,Does NOT work on 3 inch discs,I received this unit and it does NOT repair 3 inch discs. There is another unit by the same company that has a 3 inch convertor ring.
1,lost,this is the worst product i have ever used. for example i had a greatest hits album for alice in chains. it was destroyed by my audiovox cd player stay away from. but really i read the directions for the skipdr carefully and even had someone who had one help me. guess what the wheel bent after just smearing all over the disk. this does not fix anything and if you are looking for something to fix your disks this is something to not even make eye contact with.
1,Waste of money,I just ran my first (and last) cd through the Scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when I started. Didn't take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own. It really is worse than when I started.
4,It worked mostly,"It seems to work after you run discs through two to five times. It's pretty whiny sounding. It won't remove all the scratches you can see, but it seems to do a good enough job that I can recover the audio or dvd to make a new disc. Some of the audio discs I've repaired still couldn't play in a regular cd player, but iTunes didn't grumble when it happily ripped the track that it spit the disc out for before. This unit is a lot easier than the hand crank style - which takes a bit of effort. It's great for toddlers who find cd's. I've fixed about ten discs with it three of which still wouldn't play in the cd player, but I was able to rip them in a computer and make a new disc. I was unable to fix two discs - one I intentionally scratched badly. Interestingly, the badly scratched one couldn't be read at all in my dvd player before the repair. After the repair, it skipped here and there. I give up after running it five times on discs."
1,Motor not up to it,"The first 10 DVDs I cleaned / repaired this product worked well.However, the motor quickly burned out, making it totally useless.A version with a more sturdy motor would be a great buy - it did a good job while it worked."
5,Does what it's supposed to do.,Ordered Wednesday. Used Saturday. Review Saturday. This thing works. My sons xbox 360 got knocked down while playing a game. It put a nice deep ring around the middle of the disk. I ran through the Skip Dr. 4 times to get the scratch out. Game now works as good as before. Son happy again. Money well spent.
1,Only thing I could find,I had a small scratch to fix the dvd played but was just very slow. Now my computer wont even read it. ive had dvds with worse scratches that played. whatever this thing does it sure dosent help/
2,Recieved the wrong product,I ordered the system that came with a plug and instead recieved one that is battery operated. It works fine and has repaired several of my disks. It is noisy and works slow but the end result is decent. The batteries don't last long. There is a spot for a plug so I hope to find one that fits and works.
2,Not Exactly what i intended on getting,This product I received was different from the pictures. Yes it does the same thing but its not what I wanted initially wanted to buy. like the color and design are off and the one i received seems to be a lower end one as shown in the picture. All in all it does what i need it to do but just was not what I pictured.
3,"Does the job, but man is it noisy!","Like the title says... it really does a great job removing top layer scratches. I've used it on some pretty severe case & if it didn't remove all of the scratches the first pass, I'd send it back again & it works!Stick to the doctor, but use the manual one, it's quiet."
3,Works Fair,My cd's play okay after I use this. The problem is that the resurfacing wheel keeps popping off. It could be constructed better. It also leaves a radial pattern on the discs which I suppose is from the sanding action.
1,Very bad Product,"""Item broke one the first try, a large number of flaps folded or broke. I've asked for refund but they wanted the product back in original box. But to open the box took me 5 minutes and to reach the product I had to tear it in pieces. Didn't send. Didn't get my money back. Worst experience ever"""
1,Buyer Beware,"This device totally destroyed my DVD that I tried it on. I followed the instructions to a ""t"". Buyer Beware."
1,Missingi items,"My order di NOT include resurfacing fluid, drying cloth and felt buffing squareEasy-to-use: spray, spin and shine,atented, replaceable radial resurfacing wheel repairs up to 50 discs. Impossible to find out how to contact company."
2,Not So Skippy,"Used according to directions the Skip Dr. hasn't done anything to bring any of my DVDs back to life, even though they only have minor scratches/hazing. I've even run it 4-5x on discs I most wanted to fix."
3,Works well for some DVD's but ruins others,"I bought this item and had quite a few DVD's to repair, and for those with only minor scrathes it worked well. These required a couple of runs through the machine to fix, but it did fix them.Unfortunately, for a DVD that had some scratches that required a lot of runs through the machine to fix, it actually trashed the DVD.This is the only machine of this tyoe that I have tried so I cannot recommend another one, however since it trashed my DVD, I would not recommend this one."
1,Ruins DVDs!!!,Don't bother getting this. I had a DVD that had a scratch in the periphery and skipped occasionally. I made sure to spray the disk until it was dripping... The machine literally left a ton of scratches on the disc and caused the surface to 'fog'. I tried buffing out the scratches but no go. The DVD drive states that the medium is incompatible. Sucks!!
1,useless,"I read the reviews, it sounded good. I had a DVD and a game that needed fixing, and the cost of the unit was less than replacing both. I ran the game through twice and the DVD 3 times, even buffed them until I could shave in their reflection and nada. Both still froze in the same spot, not even a little improvement. I read all the comments and tips on how to do it, soaked the discs in solution and ran them through, and still nothing. If it was one disc, I'd say it was probably the disc, but it didn't work at all on either one, and they weren't even that badly scratched.Some say this thing works great, and I don't doubt that it does for some people. I'd just say you should consider it a pleasant surprise if it works for you, but you shouldn't expect it to."
2,not worth the money,It made little notable difference or improvement.I would not recommend this product for small scratches and it only makes minor improvements to anything more serious.
4,It will improve your disks,"The Skip Dr will not ""fix"" your scratched disks, but it will improve the play quality. My son has many scratched disks and if one skips, we send it through the machine 2-3 times and it works much better. Beats replacing all the scratched music and movies! The sanding wheel will wear out quickly so buy extras. It does not come with an AC adaptor which is a negative."
3,CD/DVD Repair,"I had previously purchased this item for my own use. It worked fine on Some problem CDs or DVDs but not on all, which didn't seem in worse shap than the ones fixed. However purchased this one as a gift since it was reasonably to have for the times it worked"
4,Well Worth It,"Very easy to use. I gave it 4 stars because it worked to fix the scratches on some older dvds, but I tried to use it to fix a newer dvd that was freezing up in the middle of the program and all it seemed to do was erase the data on the disc, as the screen suddenly turned yellow and purple. If you can't visibly see the scratches on your disc, I would suggest not using this product to attempt repair."
2,Collecting dust,"Well, technically, it works! I bought this over a year ago, and I was able to restore two or three dvds right away. But for the price, I should have just bought used dvds that work. One go only seems to strip about 80% of the way around the dvd. The replacement wheel costs too much to bother buying. I would recommend only buying this for dvds that are irreplaceable. And don't kid yourself- you can't effectively buff these dvds by hand afterward, I tried. You will have to strip more, using up more of the wheel's precious grit, and your dvd will look like crap. Either buy a buffer, or take your resurfaced dvds to a game shop to have them buffed for a small fee. I don't think I quite got my money's worth out of it, but will just cut my losses."
1,Rip-off junk,This system made our discs totally unusable. We had to throw them away. What more can I say!
1,scratch remover,This sucks. It was supposed to come withsome squirter fluid but it didn't. I had to order the sspray separetly
3,Helpful but not a cure,Did appear to improve the DVD disks but some may have been beyond repair. For $15 worth a try for lightly damaged DVD disks. I haven't tried it for CDs.
5,This item is great!!!,"We have alot of baby einstein videos that our son who is know 2 1/2 has scratched up severly over the past few years. His now favorite dvd Cars..which he got from Santa was so badly scratched that the disc became unreadable during the second half of the movie. I first bought the Memorex repair kit because I thought the adapter would suit us better. I tried the repair 3 times and the disc was still unreadable. I returned that to the store, and purchased the skip doctor. After just one time running it through, the Cars movie is back in business in our home. A few of the Baby einstein DVD's had to be repaired 2 times, but work now with the exception of one which skips at the very end. This machine does mark a pattern into the disc after repair, but it works like magic. I am very happy to have bought this item."
1,Did Not Work For Me,"I bought this specifically for one TV show disc I had that skipped in parts. I used the product on it and it skipped just as much as it had before. I believe this is because the skipping was caused by some gunk that was on the disc and not a scratch and the box says this product is just for scratches not cleaning. However, this was not readily apparent to me from reading the Amazon page so it gets a star."
1,Simply Doesn't Work at All..,Motor was not strong enough to even turn the cd or turn the buff wheel.. Take wheel off and the motor will turn but put wheel back on and nothing..100% worthless product.
2,"Skip Dr,",To tell the truth this scratch repair system will work on most scratches but the problem is the motor is not strong enough in battery power to do that. If you buy this get the power adapter. I was lucky enough to have a power adapter to run it. Even with it the doctor tends to get bogged down unless it is drenched with the solution. The manual does not tell you how to replace the resurfacing wheel either making this $25 item a throw away.
4,Excellent for repairing DVDs,"It is so quick and easy to use. I was using another brand and it was a long involved process and sometimes had to be repeated and still the DVD was not repaired. With Dr. Motorized Automax there's no problem. I only wish it came with the plug adapter so, I wouldn't have to always use up my batteries. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."
4,worth the buy.,"It works well, it may take a couple times on deeper scratches but over all worth the buy."
5,Works Great. Repaired my scratched Xbox 360 Games.,"This works great. It's easy to use, has easy to understand and clear instructions.After reading the instructions, I had both my damaged games (disks) fixed in less than a minute each. No problems what-so-ever. Both disks were scratched in a circular patern and had minor normal use scratchs. Both were damaged beyond use, now they run w/o any hickups. I'm impressed.While it works it is noisy. No surprises there.The shipping was quick, the packaging was good, overall 5 stars everything works perfectly."
5,good but why doesn't it come with the power cord,"i really think this is a great product but the fact that it doesn't come with the power cord was a surprise, and a dissapointment"
5,This has paid for itself!!,"I have used the Skip Doctor to repair 20+ Cds and DVDs. This device works! Unlike other products that attempt to fill scratches with paste, this actually polishes out the scratches. Sometimes you need to run the disc through a second time but if you follow the directions it will work almost every time (at least it has for me)! Undoubtedly it has paid for itself in the number of discs I have salvaged!"
4,"Does what it claims, but doesn't always work","This product does what it claims to do, but if a scratch is running sideways, and is deep enough, it won't help. I wish they had a wheel with a coarser grit to take off more plastic, then a finer grit to polish."
5,This thing is AMAZING!,"I just got this to try and fix two brand new games I inadvertently scratched by moving my XBox 360. I was very skeptical and did not actual think this would work but the 2 games were over $50 a piece so I thought I would try. Well shock of all shocks, IT WORKED! Both of my games now play perfectly! YAY!"
2,Worked at first...,"At first this worked well, as I originally reviewed, but after several disks, it has lost its touch. Now it ruins every disk I have put in there. I tried cleaning the wheel but this did not help. I've tried each disk around 10 times with no avail."
2,Think I got a lemon,Based on the reviews I was reading - thought this was going to be a great product. The machine will 'buff' up 1/2 a CD or DVD and eject and then I have to reinsert the disc to see if it will finish - never have gotten a complete CD done yet - too bad case it appears to fix serious scratches and if you have decent electronic equipment CD/DVD will work again.
1,Ruined every DVD we used it on.,"Saw good and bad reviews. Went for the purchase, figuring some people just used it wrong. Read the instructions, used it on a couple DVDs and now they won't even play anymore. Writing this review to try to save someone else all the money wasted. Hope this helps!"
1,Not worth it...,1st one was DOA. The replacement does not work as described. It barely cleans the disks and does not remove or improve scratches. Waste of money.
1,Waste of time,"I purchased the Skip Dr. at Best Buy a few weeks ago hoping to restore some scratched discs. I was very unsure about the product and figured it was too good to be true, but after reading good reviews (and lots of bad ones) I decided to give it a shot. In the end, it was just a big waste of time. I used 25 different discs on the Skip Dr. How many did it successfully fix? None. It actually made my discs worse by leaving weird little mirror lines on ther inside of the discs.I don't usually write reviews but I want to help out the people interested in buying the Skip Dr. Do not buy this! It will not work! There's no such things as a cheap disc polisher. You'll need to buy something that costs about $200.00 like the JFJ Easy Pro Repair Machine. Hope this helps!"
1,Good way to destroy a CD.,"It's simple: put in a CD with scratches on it and this thing pulverizes the protective finish, and in its place leaves a dull, foggy, streaky surface with hundreds of tiny new scratches. It's a complete piece of junk. I own an audiophile-grade CD player, and I'm afraid my only option is to buy new discs if they are all scratched to hell. Perhaps a $200 machine will do the trick, but even then, unless it replaces what it buffs away, your CD is essentially being destroyed -- and would only be used as a last alternative."
1,Poorly made,"Did a decent job cleaning up about 75% of a scratched disk; I polished the rest by hand. Problem is, on the 2nd disk the motor fried. Really poor quality."
1,CRAP!!! DO NOT BUY!,"Save yourself some trouble and don't buy this! I scratched an xbox360 game and in order to save some bucks I decided to purchase the Skip Dr. Automated Scratch Repair System and that way I'll would get to keep my old game and keep the repair system for another unfortunate cd scratch event. But I was way off! Right off the box the system didn't work. I placed all the batteries (not included by the way) and the battery cover wouldn't close. After some improvisation (with tape) I was able to to close the battery door. After following all the instructions I inserted the cd and to my surprise it didn't do absolutely anything! All you could hear was a sound of a small mecanism that was too weak to make the equipment work. I called customer service and they asked me to send it back to get a new replacement. But unfortunately, I do not live in the US and sending it back would be more costly than keeping the damn thing."
1,Both boxes missing items,The Skip Dr Premier showed up in a box without all the items that is was supposed to contain. There was no special drying cloth and no felt buffing square. I called to see about getting these additional items but was told to return the first item for a second. The second item didn't contain these items either. Beware of this prior to ordering. I have yet to use the item.
5,WOW!,"I had a couple discs that were not working and could not be played. For example, one of my Dvd Discs had a lot of scratches on it and could not be played. so i was looking for some good disc cleaners and i found this one. I bought it and it worked! All the scratches were removed and my Dvd discs WORKED! I was so glad and it was very easy! I recommend this product."
4,Worked great on my badly scratched CD'S,This item did the job. I had some CD'S I was going to have to replace. I used the Skip Dr. and saved them. Would recommend to anyone.
5,Career Comeback,"How refreshing to find a book that deals with how being laid off effects your entire life and the lives of those around you. So often you are led to feel that it is your fault that you were laid off, that there was something you should have done to prevent it. This book helps you to see that even though bad things happen sometimes to good people there are ways to get back on your feet through self motivation and the support of your friends and family. I highly recommend this book if you have been laid off or know of someone who is considering a new start."
5,GONNA BLOW UP,"If you live in Minnesota check these guys out at the Fine Line Cafe next time they are in town, definately something you dont want to miss if your looking for not only a good time but an awesome band~"
5,Best Gumbo you ever had - so far,"I am a Mumbo Gumbo fan, and really love this band. Hot vocals and solid contributions from all the members (drummer is very good). World music - no bad words - accordian rock (?) yep! You must try one of the CD's listed. Seven is the latest and greatest with many solid tunes. Great horn/sax section. Why do I like the music? Fun to sing along with, excellent harmony, thoughtful lyrics, dance-able tunes (toe tapping at the least!).Think New Orleans mixed with San Francisco. Lots of energy and love shows in the music. They are having fun making you happy listening to the music."
2,Dissappointed,"I purchased a Bulova Women's Champagne Bracelet Watch from Mister Watch Online and the crystal fell off the first day it was worn. I wrote to the company from which I purchased it and they emailed me a shipping label and will return it when it is repaired. They apologized for the problem but had no idea why the crystal should have become detached. Otherwise, I was happy with the purchase, the price, and the ease of shopping and ordering my watch. I believe this problem will be resolved."
3,Be sure to remove the top after use....,"I love this machine, but if you forget to remove the top after use and wait too long it will get stuck, with no way to get it off without it breaking.It met all my cleaning needs but is useless now that the top is broken due to us trying to remove it.I will buy another, but will be very careful about leaving the top off after use (and not losing it!!)"
5,Love it!,"This is great for anything. I use it on my shower doors and it gets all the build up off in seconds. No CHEMICALS!.. used it anywhere on anything, that doesn't melt. Glad i bought it. Replaces all my chemicals especailly in the bathroom. Use it on your mirrors, NO STREAKS!!!! cleans patio doors very well."
1,Waste of money...,"This machine worked ok for the first couple of times but even if you empty the tank and keep the lid off (when not in use) it just quit working. By the time you pull it out, fill with water, and attach any attachment to it all you get is hot water running down mirrors and usually end up looking for your regular cleaners and paper towels... I really wanted to like this product, I bought this to replace an older one that worked for an extended period of time but like I said, it was always faster to get a spray bottle and a towel to do any job. Save your money, save your time..."
1,"Very disappointed, Quit working after first refill","The steam produced was ineffective. A hot cloth would do a better job than this did.After the first tank emptied, I unplugged the unit and waited over ten minutes for it to cool down. I used less water on the second fill, not knowing how much liquid might be left in the tank, and plugged it back in to heat up. The light came on but NOTHING happened. I waited over ten minutes to check for steam with no results. I unplugged the unit, allowed over 15 minutes for it to cool down, unscrewed the cap and emptied out all of the water. It measured well below the ""limit"" on the refill cup. I started all over again, waited another ten minutes for it to heat up after the light came on and NOTHING happened.To say the least, I'm really disappointed and have returned this Super Steamer. I'm looking for another manufacturer of steamers."
1,Real dud,I am very dissapointed in this product. The first one I had replaced because it actually stopped working within the first thirty days. The replacement stopped working after less than a year with only a few uses during that time. Don't waste your time and money.
2,It got me steamed.,"Except for looking nice and putting out steam, this device has no value.When it arrived I tried it on a few of the things ""as shown on TV"" It got them wet and warm but didn't remove them.Last night I gave it one more try. I had some small (1/5 th of an inch or so) sticky spots of unknown origin in my bathroom. I quickly scraped one off with a finger nail. Another I hit with the steam. After a considerable length of time with no results I gave up and moved to a third spot. Finally part of that spot was removed.But it does make steam."
2,"good when its working, but won't last a year","I initially purchased the Scunci steamer that is virtually identical to the Shark steamer. It was under warranty for 1 year and in that year I believe I had it replaced at least twice. After the last one broke and it was no longer under warranty I purchased the Shark steamer, it also broke after 1 year and I am now on my 3rd steamer that just broke and it is about a year old. You are probably now wondering why I would keep purchasing a product that is so obviously laking in quality control. The answer is that when it is working it is great and I find that I can't live without it. For cleaning my car and furniture it is indispensible, it does a great job sanitizing bathrooms. I am now in the market for another steamer though and this time I am researching other brands. I don't think I will buy another Shark product."
2,euro pro shark super steamer,The product did not meet my expectation. You really neeed to exert enough effort scrubbing and wiping the floor after spraying some steam on its surface.
1,Terrible.....,"I thought I'd try out this machine for cleaning my bathroom and other odd tasks. Well I can say it doesn't clean anything. I tried it on soap scum, my bath tub, my toilet, my grout in between my tile, and my sink. Not one thing was clean after using it. Even simple dirt in my shower didn't move while being blasted by this. I even put on the scrub brush and blasted steam while I scrubbed....still nothing. This machine is worthless and I do not recommend buying it. You will waste your money."
5,Euro Pro Shark Steamer,I have now purchased this product twice as the first purchase was a gift and they liked it so much that I am giving it for a gift again. The steamer works well and is easy to use.
4,Cleans pretty well!!!,"I initially bought the newer shark steamer cleaner and hated it. The newer one sputtered out steam very inconsistantly. This one has a constant flow of steam. I used this on my microwave, it shines. I used this on my stove, coffee machine, and counters and it did a great job. I even had hard jelly stuck in my fridge and it was so easy to remove (it melted off). I went all over to find one in the stores, finally got it at Kmart. I probably won't use all the attachments because I am so satisfied with what it has done."
2,Dissappointed,"I purchased this cleaner based on the prior reviews, but they did not do justice to exactly how messy the cleaning process is when using this steamer. I have a white tile countertop and water and dirt went all over the kitchen floor and down the cabinets while cleaning the top. For the amount of time it took me to then clean up everything else, I could have scrubbed the tile with bleach and a toothbrush. I don't use it anymore except out in the garage."
4,Easy to use deep cleanrer,"I bought this cleaner to clean the grout in our hall floor tile and hall floor bath. My son was the one who actually cleaned all the tile. The steam cleaner was easy to use, worked very well, but did require that a small brush be used to get the best results. The water in the steamer lasted a long time and did not require frequent fill-ups. Overall, I would say this was a good buy, reasonable price, and will be used for many cleaning products in our home."
1,It was broken upon receipt so back it went,The steamer didn't work - had to send it back so I have no idea if it's worthwhile. Very disappointed.
1,Euro-Pro Shark Steamer,"my husband picked this up for me at a local retailer - NOT impressed at all for many reasons but the biggest reason is that when you ""clean"" a surface with the wide cleaning pad it pretty much moves the dirt from place to place without really picking it up at all.... I wouldn't waste my money - ours is going back this week. You are better off using lysol and a rag to clean with - at least you can rinse out the rag and the lysol will sanitize...."
3,theresa,"The shark was O.K. I was not totally impressed. I still have the moldaround the tub corners, nothing seems to work"
4,Best Sanitizer,"I have the big Euro and bought this one for other jobs. Really great at cleaning mirrors with no ammonia, cleaning around the toilet, grout, clothes, pet beds. You can steam just about anything. Spray down your shower with vinigar water (1/15 parts) then steam (twice a week) and you will never see mold or soap residue."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I have hard water, and had hoped it would help with that somewhat. It didn't. It did dissolve soap scum instantly, but for tougher stains you could be steaming them for a half an hour or more. The mirror attachment works okay, it does cause excessive dripping. It is somewhat cumbersome to work with, but I imagine with practice I'll get better at it. I had hoped it would be the miracle promised, but honestly, it just doesn't cut it."
1,piece of garbage,"I used the steamer once and it didn't clean anything. I put it in my garage and went to go try it again and now the lid is jammed on. Customer service told me it was not supposed to be stored with the lid on, but that is nowhere in the instruction book. They were very rude to me and told me it is obvious that you do not store a steamer with the lid on. They refused to fix it unless I paid a great deal for the repair. The machine is garbage and the customer service is even worse. Do not waste your money."
1,Not impressed,"I thought this item would be a life-saver, save some elbow grease, but, more importantly, work when elbow grease wouldn't.So, did it work? Well, on apartment bathroom tile that was dirty between the cracks? No.Did it remove any stains from a T-shirt that we tried before putting it on the sofa? No, it only made the T-shirt soaking wet!Did it remove soap scum from the sink? Well, yeah, sort of, but it took about five times longer than if I had just done it the old-fashioned way.Did it remove burnt-on food from under the stove burners? Yeah, a little of it, but I got so frustrated after waiting 10 minutes that I gave up and finished it myself with some elbow grease and Comet.Did it remove hard water stains? No.So, was it worth 40 bucks? No. Even free, honestly, it's basically a waste of time and energy. Much easier to grab a papertowel or rag and do it the old-fashioned way...at least until someone invents something better. :)"
1,Spit and Splutter,I bought it at K-Mart because it could be easaly returned.Disapointment. Should be called Spit and Splutter. It did a great job getting all the clothes wet but the wrinkles remained.I took it back.
2,Just a bunch of hot air...,"If I wanted to work this hard, I would have gotten a job on the railroad!You have seen the info-mercials. You have seen it on QVC. I have seen it in my kitchen and bathroom. This steam cleaner is really no cleaner at all. It almost moves the caked on debris from around the faucets, but not quite. It almost cleans the mirrors and windows, but not quite. It even, almost got the soap scum from around the sink and shower drain...but not quite! The only place where I found this machine was worth anything, was on the glass top stove. No harsh chemicals allowed. The steam along with a good bit of elbow grease, did fine. Anywhere else in the house, open the windows, get the rubber gloves, mask and CLR out of the closet and get after it. I thought maybe the Shark Steam cleaner was to good to be true, too bad I was right!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I had to return this because it doesn't work! The infomercial makes it seem like the steam it produces can clean everything with ease. I wanted to get the corners of my oven clean, where the self-cleaning cycle doesn't reach-and I set this product up, waited for the steam and proceeded to spray the area. Needless to say not only didn't it clean it, but it started spitting out hot water and made a mess. Don't waste your time!"
2,Hard h2o clogs unit,"This was a dud, used a couple of times & we have well h2o & it must of built calcium or something inside where it doesn't work..I have tried vinegar & lime away inside and still doesn't work. Waste of $$"
2,Worked great and then died...,"I really enjoyed this when it was working. I put it away for a while, took it out and it had died. I thought maybe due to hard water, but I ran a bunch of stuff through it (even though I probably shouldn't have) and could never get it to clear out..."
2,Kind of tricky to use...,"I bought the shark with hopes that it would save my kitchen and bathroom from hard to reach grime and stains that wouldn't come off any other way. It was sadly only a mediocre help to my housework. The shark does a good job of removing the grime that lives around faucet handles and in the jam of the refrigerator, but I found it totally useless when trying to clean the stove, or any expanse of tiles that was more than three or four inches. The process of cleaning takes so long, a person would go mad before they cleaned all of the tiles in the bathroom! I was thrilled to buy this product, but it didn't live up to my hopes and dreams!"
1,Only got to use it 5 times. Broke,"Had this about 4 months, used it 5 times and it stopped working. I don't have hard water, so it wasn't that. The Thumb button for making it work, is stuck in the Open position. Steam starts coming out, and doesn't stop until the unit is either unplugged, or all of the water is steamed away. Extremely dissapointed with the longevity of this unit. Had a Scunci that lastedalmost three years, and it was used when I got it. Going to try a Mculloch unit next. Maybe."
2,A big disappointment.,"Euro-Pro Shark Super SteamerWe bought this to clean the grout between the ""honeycomb"" tile in our bathroom. The area around the base of the toilet gets especially grimy, and mopping just doesn't do the job. We'd gotten down on hands and knees with a scrub brush to get it clean. That worked pretty well, but used wa-a-a-y more elbow grease than we were willing to use. We thought a blast of steam would do the trick with a lot less effort. Not so. The tile and grout were a little cleaner (about as clean as it would be had it been cleaned the regular way) but not as clean as with the scrub brush. Kind of wasted our money unless we can find another use for it. I wouldn't recommend it for this application, but it may be helpful with other cleaning tasks."
4,Pretty Good Cleaner,"I seldom review products but after using this a bit, I feel compelled to do so. I want to start by saying I think this is a pretty good cleaner as long as you know what to expect. The shark does not get hot enough to get rid of the baked on mess on your stove or anything really sticky. This steamer does a great job of general cleaning without the use of any chemicals. If you have white cabinets and lots of moulding around door frames etc, this thing is GREAT. It blasts all the dust and dirt that settles on them and makes it easy to clean. All in all, I'd say this is a pretty good cleaner, just don't expect miracles."
2,"Okay for maintenance, not for initial cleaning","This is not something you would use to get to tough grime and spots without the use of chemicals, but it's fine for maintaining cleanliness once things are already clean. Tried it on my oven door which is a professional Viking without self-cleaning (dumb, I know) and it could not even touch the grease build up. What it did do was soften the baked on mess, but I still needed a cleaning solution and a razor blade to really get it clean. It was okay on glass shower doors, but even that is still easier with a regular bathroom cleaner. The best use for this is in the nooks and crannies that gather grime and junk...it will blow it right out and the leave the spot clean. We bought it for ""greener"" cleaning, but it's use is limited...go with a full-sized steam cleaner instad...maybe the Steam Buggy which we also use even though it's a bit cumbersome."
2,A dissapointment,"I purchased this steamer, thinking it would make cleaning all of my bathroom grout a lot easier. Well, it didn't really do anything to the grout, except get it wet. I should have known the ad was too good to be true.Euro-Pro Shark Super Steamer"
1,stopped working after 8 uses,I guess it's blocked somehow but there is no way to clean it on the inside. Into the trash it goes...what a waste!
4,no box,"received it on time, all in new condition, but it was all just tossed into a bag. I wish it came in a box instead, and I was too lazy to count to make sure they were all there. I'm sure they were."
2,Poor Excecution,"The idea of Batman through the ages is intriguing yes. And as a HUGE Batman fan I can say that this was executed horribly. The stories are too short and frankly annoying. Things come up and go away without any regard for pacing or interesting storytelling. The Elseworlds label has a history of interesting narratives and even more interesting situations but the whole Batman through time story just fails to deliver. The stories are at times silly and seem like they're trying too hard to be different. Avoid at all costs, go for Red Son or The Nail instead."
4,Run-of-the-mill Elseworlds,"Just what you would expect from an Elseworlds tale, interesting alternate versions of Batman from Medieval to Futuristic Bat-Woman, nothing amazing.There are a few things that give the stories a little distinction:-The ""Medieval Batman"" artwork is very dark and moody with a painted quality that does provide an ancient tone.-This first story segues perfectly into the ""Modern Batman"" which contains an interesting alternate origin.-Vandal Savage is a great ""misguided"" villain, who is not written as being evil for the sake of being evil.Unfortunately, the last ""Future Bat-Woman"" story has very alienating artwork and a confusing plotline that doesn't provide a satisfying ending to the trilogy of tales. But the talking monkey as the new ""Robin"" is very entertaining.Like most Elseworlds stories, this one starts out with promise, but fizzles out by the end."
1,"cute concept, lousey execution","This is a lovely idea, and we've tried two of them. Unfortunately, both of them have had at least 1 marker that is completely dried up, making the entire thing useless! And then there's no way to get replacement markers anywhere that I've found. :("
5,"Thorogood Men's American Heritage 8"" Safety Toe Boot","This was my first Thorogood boot. Reviews from multiple sources were positive, so I got these and have been very happy with them. They are comfortable and solid. They are functional when out and about. Even though these have a steel toe, I got them for everyday wear because of the protection and stability they offer. I would buy these boots again, if these ever wear out in my lifetime."
5,Thorogood Men's 8'' safety Toe,"I picked this pair of boots because I noticed those reviews said no need breaking in,it's comfortable and last long time.Yep I've got the boots for months,but my husband did not try them yet,now he is still working hard on breaking in another pair of boots, hope this one really don't need to break in,that would impress him a lot...very quick shipping...and nice looking...so I gave 5 star first.I will review it again after wearing those boots for some time...Thanks to Amazon"
3,"Not the best option for a Tomcat, probably good for a begginer","I brought this somewhere else on the net, I have not finished it yet but there are some flaws to point out. The sprues have a LOT! of flash and ejector pins everywhere and Revell copyright info on one of the elevons. The decals for Felix 200 are very bad Felix the cat doesn't look like the Felix on the cartoons or the real aircraft itself. Seems very nice to build big and everything but for accuracy this is not a good scale model unless you do a lot of scratch building, buy aftermarket decals and put some work hours if you are a seasoned modeler. But for the fun it is a good one specially for beginners because the pieces are big and pretty much easy to handle."
2,Disappointed Tomcat Fan...,"Typical Revell/Monogram junk. New afterburner cans and a chin pod does not an F-14D make. This is just the same-old F-14A kit from the 80s repackaged with a handfull of new pieces (well, maybe a really, really small hand). Unless you're just looking for something to throw together in a hurry to have a general shape of a Tomcat, steer clear of this one. Drop and extra $20 and pick up the quality Hasegawa kit. The fit is a bit of a nightmare, but it makes an awesome display."
3,This book is great for writing a letter about one subject.,"I think this book is great for writing a letter. It tells you synonyms in case you use a word often. It also tells you a sentence and sometimes an antonym.(if there is one) This book is handy,and is fairly small. I find this book better than a thesaurus."
4,I found it useful,"I am retired in Mexico and volunteer as an English teacher. My only previous teaching experience had been tutoring with the Literacy Network in Lee, MA, so I am always looking for references and support material, which has led me to some expensive and disappointing purchases but not in this case.The text used in the program for which I volunteer does not address pronunciation but proceeds on the assumption that everyone can learn to speak a foreign language by mimicry; an assumption I find untrue. This book includes explanations in Spanish and the speakers on the CD's have a clear Midwestern (6:00 o'clock national news) accent (I am from the South), so it has worked very well in the introduction of the material.The jury is out on whether my students can improve their accents from the material as I just began using it but I am hopeful."
3,"""Es bueno para quienes lo vamos olvidando...""","En realidad a veces se olvidan algunas reglas en la pronunciación y no necesariamente con las peliculas en su idioma original se obtiene una adecuada pronunciación (demasiados slams).., por lo tanto por el precio y el producto.: Es bueno..!!"
5,Fits just right,"Remember when you were young and athletic and wore tank tops all the time? But now you have a stomach sticking out but still have big arms you want to show off. Well this tank top covers the belly and makes you look slim and buff.Actually the cut of this tank top is like they used to be, back before they started making the huge arm holes that go down to your waist. I hate those. But I like these. The sizing is true, I wear a large t-shirt, and this tank top in a large fits me fine. They are not loose and baggy. The cut is straight down. I like the price, and I bought 4 of them."
2,The image online does not match the final product,"The top of the tank online is much thinner than the actual product. The ""straps"" are wider and the scoop of the neck are much higher than the image leads you to believe."
4,Nice tank.,"This tank is a little longer and fitted than I wanted, but is very soft and comfortable to wear. Would be great for tall, slim men."
2,Not typical Russel quality,"Another Amazon sell out. If you bought a Russel product from like Macy's you found that you had a sturdy well made quality product. Worth looking for again. This is not that product. This is a crappy imported ""tissue paper"" tank. The cloth will break down from wear quickly unlike the store bought Russel clothing that has lasted me for years. I gave it 2 stars as the fit and shape are good and typical of Russel patterns. Plenty long and roomy without being a bag. I will shop local for my next tank top. To date, all Amazon tanks are Chinese tissue paper junk...sorry but consumers price expectations dictate cheaper and cheaper product...I would bet the $15 quality tanks didn't sell. Too bad you cannot handle the goods before buying...you would walk to another rack and spend the extra $7."
2,mr.,I was also displeased with the shape and material as compaired with previously bought shirts from russell. they're a totally different shirt from the previous tagged shirts. Where can I buy those?
2,Picture is Misleading for Women,"If you look at the armhole in the picture, it looks as though a woman would be able to wear it (I love wearing loose fitting men's clothing around the garden), but the armhole is so big that almost any bra will show through.I know it's a man's shirt, but I went by the picture and was disappointed. I'm sure I'm not the only woman who occasionally buys men's clothing for one reason or another and I wanted other ladies to know.I did find the quality of the material to be fine."
1,Miss,"Do not buy if you are thinking these tank shirts are the same as the picture, they are not, they are TOTALLY different, my finance hated them, they were much more cheaply made and did not have the ""jocktag"" in the bottom left corner, I purchased 8 of these thinking they were the ones he loves, not the case. I had to return all but 1 since he opened it and ripped off the tag. So were stuck with one, which is fine but just not worth it.I wish they would just change the picture...would have saved me alot of time.Ashame, never had this problem with the product not matching the item from amazon"
2,Rusell has changed.,"I purchased four of these tops to replace previous Russell tank tops. They are NOT the same, thinner material. cheaper material not as soft more synthetic. The collar comes up higher and the sleeve openings are smaller because the staps are wider. Normally my Russell (age) get softer and more pliable. These don't. To sum it up (outsourcing) these feel like the Chinese new and improved version. Go with a different brand."
2,Not comfortable,"These shirts are too tightly woven and heavy. Have no give to them, and don't like the shape."
1,this is falsely advertised--it is not 100% cotton,"this russell shirt is advertised as 100% cotton and is in fact 53% polyester and 47% cotton. if you like to work out in a plastic shirt you will be very happy. if, however, you need a 100% cotton shirt, do not buy."
2,russell tank tops,extremly thin like ladies sheer material? looks like good quality just not enough material walmarts tanks are 8.99 & 3 to 4 times as thick.
2,Thin fabric,"The style was just right for my husband's workout wear, but the fabric is too lightweight. You can see through it."
1,BAD WEAR,GREAT FIT BUT THE PROBLEM THIS SHIRT DEVELOPED HOLES AFTER JUST TWO WASHINGS NEED MORE DURABILITY GREAT PRICE IF IT LASTED LONGER
4,Nice quality & great price!!,"I purchased this tank top for my hubby to where on our cruise vacation through the Panama Canal. It fits true to size, fits nicely, and the material is nice quality. Also the product didn't shrink much in the wash, which was great."
3,Too large for it's size,"Price was right, it's comfortable, but cut larger than any of my other XXL tank tops. If you're in shape, check the sizing, you may want to buy a couple sizes smaller that your normal or buy a different brand and style."
3,Not a great shape,the tank top did not fit nicely as its shape was not made for guys working out. I expected a better fit coming from Russell Athletics.
2,Chose wrong item it seems.,Not really what I was looking for or expected. It is ok if was looking for something to play basketball in but I was looking for an undershirt
3,not like the old days,"Russell's tank tops, like their shorts, are not what they used to be. The material feels rather flimsy, and does not soften after multiple washings. As with much these days, quality has 'gone south'."
4,"Good,basic t shirt","The item was received very quickly and was correctly described on the web page. THis is a good basic shirt that is reasonbly priced, and can be used for school, working out, or other casual wear."
3,cheated,I bought three tanks to replace much older tanks. I am very disappointed in the repacement tanks. They are much thinner and very cheaply made. The picture showed the tank I had purchased years ago (pro- cotton) not the ones I received.
2,Disappointed,"The item is what I was wanting... however...after one (1) washing,the stiching pulled out along a 3 inch strip at the under arm. (sad)."
5,Great tank!,"I was expecting a mediocre tank, but this is very comfortable and very high quality. It doesn't hug against the body, so there're plenty of room for your pores to breathe. It is heavier than most other brands. The material is 50% polyester and 50% cotton. Too bad they don't have a size small also."
1,Not the same shirt from the picture,These shirts are not the same as from the image provided. The image shows the logo sewn onto the bottom corner of the shirt. The ones they sent me had the logo printed behind the neck. The only reason I bought them on here was because it was the sewn version. I'm very displeased with the purchase although the delivery was quick.
3,You get what you pay for,"Its an inexpensive, comfortable, but cheaply made tank top. Great for workouts with it's heavy duty cloth. If you are looking for a cheap workout shirt, get it."
1,Russell Athletic Tank,"I ordered these tanks because I had previously purchased through another vendor a year ago. The picture on Amazon with the Russell tag on the bottom left was what I ordered. When they arrived, I immediately removed the packaging and washed them. They shrank to nothing. On observation, I noticed they were a different Russell tank without the tag on the bottom left. My bad for not checking them in their packaging. Shame on Amazon for selling a product other than pictured."
2,Ridiculously too long but otherwise good.,"My only complaint it that this is way, way too long, it's stops at my knees, too long to use. I thought I see if it would shrink after washing but it's still just silly long. I'm glad I only ordered one. It does make a good cleaning rag :)"
2,Russell tank tops,I was not happy with the quality of thess shirts. I expeced a thicker cotton. Very thin!!!
3,It shrink after 4th wash,"It look nice when I first received it, how ever it started shrink and getting smaller and smaller and finally the size turned from XXL to M after the 4th wash."
4,A little long,"A little long, but good for working out and running. Lightweight, and the cotton keeps some of the sweat off of you."
5,Comfy,"Feels good on the skin, works great under a shirt. Good price. Look forward to several years of use with this."
1,Another McMurtry Mystery in the Catalogue,"This catalogue book page is incorrect.Far as I know, McMurtry was not alive in 1900 when the book on this catalogue page was supposedly published.The ISBN for ""Paradise"" by McMurtry is 0743215664; published June 6, 2002.ParadiseToo many people creating INCORRECT product detail pages."
1,A Review of Panasonic TC-26LX50,"I had read the reviews of LCD TV's in the Consumer Reports so I knew the TV was going to perform well. It exceeds my expectations with picture clarity, outstanding sound, ease of operation, and, best of all, easy installation. For the first time we are seeing all channels clearly (not all the channels on the old Panasonic came in clearly). I'm completely satisfied and well pleased with my purchase."
5,Very pleased with purchase,"I bought this in March of 2006 as a lot of stores seem to be clearing it out for newer product lines. I could not be more pleased. I spent a lot of time comparing it to the Sony 26"" Bravia which was also being reduced in price. In the end, I just preferred the picture of this so much more. Sony's have nicer reds, but I find the Panasonic has better balance overall. I use this with a DVD Component feed, Xbox Component feed, Tivo S-Video feed, and regular coax cable. The component feeds are obviously superior especially for widescreen movies. The coax/s-video feeds are excellent and not as grainy as I expected for scaled-up images. One more thing, I have a tiny condo living space, and this thing is perfectly compact and compliments my modern space."
1,Refurbed. Remote problem should have been BOLD TYPE,"Got this for someone else that fortunatly didn't need the remote to work {CAUSE IT DIDN""T}. If it had been for me I would have returned it. There is just so many less expensive TV's on the market now that if the remote doesn't work DON'T SELL IT. KEEP it or GIVE it to someone, or just Man-Up and take the lose."
5,Great LCD,"Delivery was prior to the expected date and set was in great condition. Easy to set up, easy to use"
5,Wiesner delivers the goods,"""I highly recommend Karen Wiesner's...Electronic Publishing The Definitive Guide. This is just the BEST, in my opinion, for anyone who has an e-book or is a Print-On-Demand author. She delivers the `goods.' This is an excellent energy/money out-lay to anyone.""--bestselling author Lindsay McKenna"
5,Must own resource,"""[Wiesner has] produced an effusive yet solid introduction to the field. Genre writers shut out by diminishing mass market lists will find this is a must-own resource."" Publishers Weekly"
4,Great fast read.,"The book has a slightly English flavor to it that takes some adjustment. Just the same I thought it was an excellent book about male struggles with family life. I read it twice while I waited for a book store to open. Its a great book, definitely worth a try."
5,Not what you might think,"I am prompted to write this by the other two existing reviews. These appear to be of the relatively recent English novel of the same title by Tony Parsons, rather than of this English play from the 1960s by Terrence Rattigan. The two are entirely different. I have not actually read the play as such, but I did see the recent London stage revival. It was excellent, and on the strength of that I would certainly recommend anyone to read the play. I now intend buying it myself."
3,Man And Boy,"Simply stated, a sincere and intelligent read. The first fictional piece by a male author about ""feelings"" that has engaged me. An unconventional book about conventional male experiences in the nineties. Timely issues surrounding familial ties, responsibilities, mid-life choices for better or for worse. A refreshing view of the other side of the coin!"
5,Perfect for protecting your garden!,"I own 6 of these and they perform flawlessly. Plenty of shocking power and perfect for protecting your precious garden from marauding critters looking for a meal. There are a lot of cheaper fence chargers/energizers on the market; don't waste your money on ones that short out when one blade of grass lands on it! You pay for what you get.If you need one with plenty of punch that delivers a good jolt, the SS-1000X does just that. My pet goat and sheep respect my electric fences when I have one of these operating them, too.Key features: low impedance, solid-state, imtermittent current and a joule rating of 1 or higher."
2,"Shoes cheaply made, and way too small- order size larger!!","For a cheap made shoe, it is really expensive, but i purchased it anyways for a good cause. Unfortanately, I cannot return these (plus I feel terrible if i do because if I return them, will a child get to give up their free pair from my purchase??). I was so excited to get them for my trip to NY since I hear everyone tell me ""bring good shoes"". I thought this would be good. Apparently not! The shoes are really super cute, but they fit so tight and I am tiny size 6.5-7!! The shoes are made out of canvas and they do not stretch either!! this is a bust and i wish i would have known to order a size above. The company should give a warning or a heads up on their marketing on how they are made-too small!!"
5,Makings of Monica,"This album is diverse. She sounds like a different Monica. She sounded like this on After The Storm. This album sounds as good as that one. This album shows how much she has matured over the years. She dedicates this album to her son, Rodney Hill, Jr. This also reflects the 11 years of Monica's presence on the music scene. The Makings Of Me is ALL Monica is."
5,Love it,"I know this is a late review...but this album is a must have in your collection. I have been reading posts and Blogs about this cd..and I'm like r u serious. This CD was good, although I don't agree with the choice they picked for her singles but overall the CD WAS GREAT! My favs are: Hell No, Why Her, My Everything, Raw and Get Away!"
4,and she keeps it going,well another one from monica I can honestly say I actually listened to the whole Cd and overall it was very nice my favorite was Raw.
3,Not what i expected,This album was definitely not what i expected from Monica. She could've done much better. I skipped over so many songs it's not even funny. For $14 i'm very disappointed. Guess some artists aren't worth investing in. Her last album was pretty good so I have no idea what happened.
3,Better than Beyonce's BDay that's for sure!,"If I had to pick a favorite R&B album of 2006 it would be Monica's ""The Makings of Me."" If it weren't for the internet I would have never even known that this album existed! The lead single ""Everytime Tha Beat Drops"" is so addictive with it's beats and rapping. It's Monica at her best. This album is better than Brandy's most recent offering ""Human."" A lot of the songs are listenable and even though it's not perfect, it is still a LOT better than Beyonce's 2006 album ""B Day."" I would definately give this 3.5 stars out of 5. Only reason why my rating isn't higher? ""The Makings of Me"" only has 10 songs."
4,monica! WOW!,"i just bought this album!! i think this is the best album after THE BOY IS MINE! i love all of her songs except for EVERYTIME THA BEAT DROP!! It sucks! but the conclusion is, the album is great!"
3,The makings of a decent album,"I have to say that I think After the storm is probably her strongest album all around, but this would probably come in a close second. I really don't think she made a smart choice by releasing ""Everytime tha beat drops"" as her first single, as it does not represent her album as a whole. There are some strong songs on her but it just seems like something was still missing from this album. Hottest tracks would have to be ""Dozen roses"", ""Hell no"", ""Move on"" and ""Getaway"". I feel like if there were atlest 3 or 4 more songs on the album as good as these, this would have been one album to top for this year. Nonetheless it's still a great effort by Monica and one of the better albums this year."
5,Didn't See This One Coming,"Surprisingly Monica did it again. I did not expect such a come back. Unfortunately, the CD only has ten tracks, but this disc is indeed another Monica classic. Monica, shows us she hasn't gone anywhere, and the roots of her music never changed."
3,monica has lost it,"i think monica is good vocalist but this is weak effort on monica part i grew on monica and brandy i think it bad how monica career going she use too get radio play all the time in the 90,s with no problems when i was 12 14 years old she get played on r&b and pop sations all she gets played but R&B sations only brandy also and problems unlike madonna MONICA still get play on radio and able crossover in the next decade madonna was only able two decade the 80,s when she frist come out and in the early and mid 90,s when she was at her best now back monica she maybe fainting out ciara is great job so far unlike beyonce cd it awful but they promit because it,s beyonce i guess so i hope monica does better next time she a good artist"
2,it's aight,"this is the kind of Album that Monica should have made years ago as to being forced into making alot of the tired Dult contempary music she was handed. some of these tracks would have blended really well after her debut with ""Just one of dem days"". Monica can sing&has out-lasted brandy who was her musical peer&Counter part in the cross-over pre beyonce era of the mid to late 90's.""Sideline Ho"" is a cool track&would have been even more on point some years back.problem with Monica is that she has a few cool tracks&then the filler starts to pile up&Her voice gets lost in the mix&you never get that potential of what she truly has back. she is better than alot of the material she gets,but for the most part has settled for run of the mill formula that never fully captures what she truly has in her as a Artist."
5,LOVE IT,I was so happy to see that htis company had the CD and the price WOW Thank you very much the CD came way before the dates that I thought it was and it was in good condition I will be buying from this company again.
1,R&B singer or Rapper,"I've been down for Monica since the beginning; but now I am FINISHED, I love Monica's voice, but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers...WTF!!! I want the soulfoul Monica from the first CD, ""Sideline Ho"" ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! again WTF!! Could someone please come out with a soulful mature CD, cause this one aint even close."
2,What Happened?????,I don't like this CD at all what happeed to the classy Monica???Too Ghetto.... Such a waste of such a beautiful voice!!
3,Very Ghetto,"Ahh...what can I say about his Monica production. Shall I say very Ghetto. From her overall appearance to all the tattoos, GHETTO. Not sure what happened to her, but it's a mediocre product at best. I liked 5 out of the 10 songs. 'A Dozen Roses' is good. 'Sideline Ho', is a little of the top. 'Gotten Move On' is good. 'Every time the Beat Drops' is very hip-hop and I like it. However, I must say. Letoya is still killing them all; a much better product, I must say."
1,UNSAFE,I was very excited to purchase the marathon car seat by Britax. It was highly recommended and the reviews on it were great. My son is 2 1/2 years old and is able to lift the adjuster inbetween his legs and release the harness. Today he tapped me on my shoulder as I was driving.... He was able to get out of his car seat by releasing the harness himself. VERY DANGEROUS!!!
2,Owner of Roundabout Loved it Moved to Marathon UNHAPPY,"We have had our son in a Britax roundabout since he was 3 months old. We LOVED this seat. We were happy with the reviews and he was comfortable and safe. We recently purchased a Britax Marathon since he is now 3 years old. He is able to reach down to the release and easily pull up on it and can make his straps loose without me even knowing he is doing it which is extremely unsafe !!The roundabout has a push button that he is unable to reach and press so that worked to keep him safe. I went to the Britax website and saw that this is a common complaint, WHAT???? It seems that we are to teach our children not to unlatch it by themselves... I have an overactive toddler and I cannot watch him while I am driving. I wanted a carseat instead of a booster so he could not unbuckle himself. I am now looking for a different brand reluctantly."
3,"very safe BUT high levels of chlorine, lead and bromine","Study conducted by a Michigan Environmental group deternimed that this seat has one of the highest levels of the substances. I think the coloring of this seat has more to do with the chemicals.I have a different Britax and I LOVE it, the best seat for my kids. Design is great, but get a color other than Platinum."
5,This Seat Rocks !!!,"What a great seat!!! Excellent growth for the long term. I especially like the sides of the seat that offer great side impact protection. Also a five point harness that accomodates a child up to 65lbs and 49"" in length. The 5-point harness was super easy to use and adjust. Seat installation was a breeze with the latch system included.I bought my seat online at travelingtikes.com who's prices were far lower than any other advertised price by more than fifty dollars shipping included.....right on! I purchsed the tan seat ""portland"" that best matched our car interior.Im so happy that Britax is rated so well and that their seat is such a household name which made my purchase that much easier to research.My little guy is styling!!!"
3,Little Hands Can Loosen Restraints,"We are very happy with the carseat, however, my 19-month-old daughter has figured out that she can loosen her harness by reaching down and pulling on the adjuster lever. After a recent ride in the car, I discovered her sitting in the carseat with the straps hanging loosely and providing no restraint."
5,"Excellent, Exact Fit on any Ford 460","Buy it here, best price anywhere, plus free shipping. Dealer wanted over $250 just for the oil pan and another $90 for the dipstick tube. This is a complete kit, oil pan, dipstick and tube, gasket and new pick up tube/stud. I bought this for my F350 4x4 Dump, it fit perfect, down to the mounting tab on the dipstick tube being exact. I fell into place on the manifold mounting stud.Top quality Ford Racing parts, Ford OE numbered part. No reason to pay at least double at other online sites, gouged at the dealer or taking a chance on a used pan because it will rust out if it hasn't already started. The factory oil pans all rust. It is not necessary to pull the motor on F250 or F350 trucks to change the pan...."
1,misleading lamp NOT a floor lamp or Full spectrum,This is a floor lamp??!!(perhaps for a 3 year old...read the dimensions which I did not thinking a floor lamp would be for reading especially since it claims to be a full spectrm lamp. It does not fit on a table & on the floor it looks ridiculious. It claim to have a full spectrum light which it did not include( it must be 20 watt full spectrum which stores only carry 27 watt so one must order from the lamp company) & it claim to have a floor off & on switch which it does not!! This is the first product I have EVER been disappointed in from Amazon...I make a point to mainly order from them directly & not from other companies they represent because I think they have great quality control...this one got pass them!! I would rate this a minus star!!TENSOR FULL SPECTRUM FLOOR LAMP
4,Don't be swayed by PW,"With all due respect to Publishers Weekly, I think the review above betrays a reviewer stressing under a deadline and hoping for a quick read. Gann's novel is a small wonder, one that rewards attentive reading and even rereading. His language is elegant and musical, and his incisive portrayal of some of the most unusual, yet believable characters is a rarity in contemporary fiction. This is not a novel that can be read and fully appreciated within a few hours, and, if one gives it the proper attention, will linger in the reader for a long time."
1,Bad beyond belief,"Andrisani brings new depth of meaning to 'superficial' in his latest 'instant' book.Content is, as with Andrisani's 'Hogan' book, misleading and wrong. For example Andrisani characterises Woods' old swing as 'rounded' and his new swing as 'upright' whereas, as everyone with the slightest interest in this subject knows, it is precisely the opposite that is the case. How do books this bad get published?Rubbish. Avoid."
4,Don't sleep on this one,"There's something seductive about the debut album of an underground artist. Perhaps its that deep soul sound you get before an artist starts churning out pop singles and filler tracks. I listened to this on puretracks and I'm hitting it up for sure. The simple soul, rhythm and blues feeling will take you back to the 'old skool' days of lounging in on live jazz performances. It has the soul of John Legend but with much more of an old school aura.This rhythm IS divine. Don't sleep."
5,Easy & Indestructible,"These replaced a vintage footed-aluminum colander I picked up at a neighborhood consignment shop. I wanted a strainer that met three standards:1) is durable & easy to clean2) dries easily (so I can put them away quickly after use)3) wouldn't scratch my sink or counter topsThese fit the bill; also, for the price, you get four colanders, which is great when you need to simultaneously drain hot and cold items, or multiple fragile fruits and veggies. The shape is wide & accessible, and not too tall for low-angled faucet heads.Also important, these colanders are finely-meshed, so even small items (including the tiny ball bearings I use to clean glass bottles) won't fall through. Because they dry quickly, I can leave nectarines or other fruit in them after rinsing without worrying.Last, they are light-weight but not flimsy - just a good choice for anyone in the market for a colander."
5,"great Japanese design and quality, underpriced for the quality","Inomata is the Rubbermaid of Japan, snap up any product you see by them because they are so well made.First, they nest perfectly.The two largest ones are just right for washing and letting air dry two quarts of strawberries, two heads of Romaine lettuce, four pints of blueberries, etc.Second, they are lightweight but durable. You do not have to drag them out.Third, they are a nice color that goes well with your greens and fruits.I don't know how I did it when I only had one stainless steel colander.As I try to eat more fruits and vegetables, the colanders have made my life easier. I can just stick a whole laden colander or two in the fridge, as I would still have one or two free to use!"
4,Colanders for less,I bought these when my son took my Colander home with him complaining that one cost over $20 at the store. They store easier than my old one did and the different sizes makes them more convient
4,Fine Tribute,"This recording is Murray's tribute to Don Pullen. I am not a Pullen fan and my exposure to Pullen is limited to his work on a couple of other Murray recordings (e.g. the exceptional ""Shakhil's Warrier"". So I cannot comment on how well the recording pays tribute to Pullen. However, this is varied and enjoyable set, and well worth getting for the chance to hear Murray and pianist D.D.Jackson together for a full release. Murray devotees should feel happy to add this to the largest Murray collection."
5,I have one of these,"Having received this book as a birthday present when I was a child, I cannot imagine ever bearing to part with it. I still have mine 35 years later. My only wish is that the company were still in business so that I could do the same thing for my nieces that my uncle did for me."
4,Strange and Good,"This book was recommended to me by a friend, not because it was good, but based on its style. It was not an easy read, but is probably worth the effort, in the end.Buddy Bolden was the first ""King of Jazz"" who lived right on the cusp of recorded music. His contemporaries were among the first artists to be recorded but Buddy never was.This is Bolden's sad biography, written in a fractured, stream of consciousness, multiple point of view style. I imagined, as I read it, the writer taking a story and syncopating the rhythm in a way that is the hallmark of Jazz. He did that, and also reflected Bolden's Schizophrenia.Viewed from that perspective: William Faulkner meets Louis Armstrong meets Syd Barrett, it really works, in the end.Here is a very talented writer."
5,Outstanding book about early american music.,"I really enjoyed this book. I had just finished But Beautiful for the second time and noticed a reference to Coming Through Slaughter. If you are interested in the history of early american music; the blues, jazz, and the struggle of the brilliant black americans who made it this is a great read. Much more than a history text, this book is a heartrending story told through the eyes, ears, and heart of the talented and troubled trumpeter, Buddy Bolden. Highly recommended!"
3,From an Enlish Literature Perspective...,"As I read Ondaatje's book, I became frustrated and synical. I found Coming Through Slaughter to be a relatively hard read, yet still invigorating. Reading this for an OAC, English Literature course, I found this book to not be a great read. Although enjoyable, and fascinating, I was confused with where the story was going, and how the events fit in in the order Ondaatje placed them. While regarding the themes, and style, I was taken aback by the beauty in which it was written."
2,Zippity-do-dah-crap,"I've been forced to wade through a lot of boring crap in my life: Thomas Hardy, Jane Urquhart's Changing Heaven, Leviticus, and this book was one of the biggest bores of them all. Nobody seems willing to admit to the fact that everything Ondaatje writes is tedious, self-indulgent and overdone. This guy sits around for 10 years with this thumb up his ass and at the end of it this is all he has to show for it. True, he's not bad looking for an old Sri Lankan guy, but that's no reason to let this guy continue churning this stuff out. My advice to him would still be that it's never too late to go into a new line of work."
3,Not her best,"I thought I would never finish this book. Could tell half way through how it would end, and at times, I felt I was reading parts of chapters over in other chapters. This book could have been a LOT smaller.I agree also...am tired of paying more for the Kindle edition than a hardback."
5,Couldn't put this book down!,I absolutely loved this book. I felt like i was in the midst of all characters involved. This is the first Karen White novel I have read and can't wait to read more by her. It was a beautiful as well as heartwrenching story of estranged sisters who find their ways back together and home.
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"This book was offensive to me as someone who has lived in the north and the south. It hit on every possible cliche regarding behavior. North is bad; south is good. Money is bad; genteel poverty is good. Homemaking good; career woman bad. The heroine was a doormat, the hero a judgmental jerk. The whole thrust of the story is that family should always be forgiven (no matter how awfully they treat you) and you should sublimate your ambition on their behalf. I want my money back."
2,Wow...so lame,How disappointing this book is! I've been reading it for a few weeks--just can't seem to sit down and finish. The writing is very basic with every cliche thrown in. Definitely not up to par with others of hers. It reminds me of Pat Conroys lastest book...by that I mean a normally good writer bombing horribly.
3,Pretty good story but I have read better,This book was somewhat boring and very predictable all the way through. I thought it was a sweet story though.
5,Karen White exceeds all expectations with FALLING HOME,"Karen White has produced a book in FALLING HOME that goes far beyond the normal expectations of a contemporary romance novel. The growth in maturity and perceptions of her heroine, Cassie Madison, encourage the reader to look into her own past for people she has failed to forgive and the growth enabled by that forgiveness. The texture and atmosphere Ms. White gives to Cassie's hometown in Georgia is worthy of a literary novel and her love interest, Sam, is reminiscent of the actor/writer Sam Shepherd, with all his ""laid back"" strengths. For readers who enjoy suspense, there is also an element of danger that hovers over the novel with enough red herrings and surprise elements to keep you reading. I read this novel over a week-end, taking little time off. Readers will not be disappointed."
4,I'm halfway through the book and enjoying it.,"The book arrived in new condition and it is a light read. I like the author's style (and I have three more books by her that I will read in the order they were written.) As always with Amazon, the book was here a couple of days after I ordered it, wrapped nicely."
2,If You Haven't Already - You Need To!,"First Karen White I've read! I LOVED IT! So down to earth.Karen has a way to make you fall in love with her characters. Cassie, small town girl, left the town she grew up in. She had to return 15 years later to deal with family issues & boy, do they turn into issues! Excellent read!Don't forget ""After the Rain""...Joe's continued story."
1,What's wrong here!,"I would love to have this book on my Kindle. BUT, I'm not paying 9.99 for the Kindle version when the paperback is six bucks. What's wrong with this picture??????"
1,Price Issues,"I didn't actually read this book. I am trying to read more on my kindle rather than buying books. However, I will NEVER pay more for a kindle book than I would for the actual book. Each book produced has a price associated with the ink, the paper, the printing machinery, the weight for shipping, etc. Please explain how the marginal costs per copy can be more once the book is put into digital format. If I decide I need to read this book (or any book where the kindle cost is more than the actual book) I will get it from the library where the publisher (and sadly the author) will get no money from me at all."
4,Good Southern character and charm,"This was a good read. I grew tired of the main character holding a grudge from her teenage years and her ""childish"" reaction, but otherwise an enjoyable read."
1,If this had been an actual book and not an ebook on my Kindle I probably would've tossed it across the room...,"Oh boy, where to start?The Californian fiancé who is so awful that he's basically a caricature? The blanket generalizations about northerners from southerners who get really irritated when anyone makes a generalization about a southerner? How the concept of 'family' is apparently only recognized below the Mason-Dixon line? How all of Cassie's family and friends completely disregard and belittle all of her decisions and desires? The saintly Melanie Wilkes-ish sister? How Sam, the romantic interest, doesn't ever really even seem to like Cassie and is mostly just obsessed with the person she was fifteen years ago?I've lived in the north and I've lived in the south, in cities and in small towns. None of those places had people as pushy and judgmental as the characters in this book."
2,Disappointed,"I've read all of Karen White's publications and did not hesitate to purchase this one as soon as it was released, even though it was a re-write of an earlier work. However, this one was a let down as the plot and characters were predictable and transparant. Very surprised she let this one go back to press, should have let it stay out of print."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Dull, repetitious, cliche, stereotypical drivel.... I got bored and skimmed over most of it to get to the predictable ending. The descriptions of the southern characters were laughable and offensive. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Falling Home,"I must disagree with most of the other reviews. I found this book to be rather boring, extremely predictable, and not especially well written. The characters were not interesting, and the story was bland. I read it only because it was a gift."
2,Too predictable,"Well, I finished this book just bc I started it, you know how that goes... It was super predictable and way too melodramatic for me. Maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did- I thought it was pretty disappointing, can't imagine how bad the first edition was. Sorry."
1,what went wrong,"i love boysetsfire. i went to UD and heard these guys all the time while i was in school. they were phenomenal from the first time i saw them (opening for fugazi) to the last days i was able to catch them coming through philly at the troc. their first album (which eventually became ""this crying..."", i sort of had as a demo with some other songs that never really went anywhere) was great and had me immediately hooked.when ""the day the sun went out"" came out, i went nuts. this is a perfect album. ""in chrysalis"" brought another handfull of songs i was happy with, including the DK cover that i expected to hate. then what happened. i guess i got old and i can't tell what's cool anymore or these guys ran completely out of inspiration. i've tried several times and i just keep getting nothing.i'm glad a lot of you have liked the newer stuff, i hope that keeps BSF around long enough for them to start writing music i like again."
2,Ehh....,"I bought this album because i had downloaded a bunch of BSF singles and I enjoyed them so much that I felt inclined to buy the album. The songs themselves are wonderful. The album as a whole stinks. Badly. Its hard to explain this. But for some reason this is one of the worst albums I own. I cant listen to a couple of the songs in a row withought turning it off. I get real tired of their babelings about communisim and how we need to reform or whatever. Its like an evangelistic preacher telling me im a sinner cause i dont bleive in hell. Man I really am not totally sure why i think this album stinks, but what I do know is that you will probably like this album. I just dont like it. I think i must be confused or somthing."
5,A masterpiece,"This is Boy Sets Fire's second full-length album and they have matured greatly since their first. Allmusic Guide feared that ""The Day the Sun Went Out"" would be their best, but they have actually outdone themselves. There are NO bad tracks on this album, my least favorite is the poppish ""When Rhetoric Dies,"" but to have no bad tracks is an amazing feat for a band these days. The styles of their music vary a lot as well. It is hard to place BSF, but usually they are called EmoCore. Their songs go straight from hardcore (""After the Eulogy"") to softer, emo songs (""My Life in the Knife Trade"") to stuff that could sit next to Pantera (""The Force Majeure""). It is a great album and they switch style seemlessly. Get it today!"
5,Emocore At It's Best,"Boy Sets Fire is one of the few bands to wear the elite title emocore as their genre of music. The lead singer's voice can vary from a sweet harmonious emotional voice to that of any other hardcore singer. The song Rookie is a good example of this diversity. Every song is catchy in its own way, and if you are new to Boy Sets Fire this is a good album to start off with, if you are a seasoned bsf fan, you better not miss this one! Ignore the comments about the band being a bunch of sellouts, their music is still awesome to this day!"
1,"If this is volume 3, I'd hate to see volumes 1 and 2!!","I just got this cd recently and listened to majority of the songs and overall wasn't really all that impressed with it. First off, there's two cds, both of which are not mixed so you get the full length version of the songs which means you have to forward 2-3 minutes of the song to get to the good parts. Second, the selection of songs is absolutely horrible. It's compiled by two guys I've never heard of and obviously have no idea what Trance music really is.I know I'm taking a chance when I buy a cd online in which I'm not able to listen to track samples and most of the time it is worth the money, but this cd was just not one of those times.My recommendation? It's simple...DON'T BUY IT!!!"
1,Horrible,This should never have been included on the Sunday Mystery Movie rotation. I bought this and watched a couple of episodes hoping for some improvement from one to the next. Terrible. Avoid this. Stick with the original Mystery Movie stars.
1,This could have been a great book.,"Keep in mind number one that this book is 40 pages long. That is 32 cents a page! If you read this page, you will have already read all that the book has to say about Pokemon.I say this could have been a great book because the concept is great. However, if you read this ad, you already have the idea that you could make your own Pokemon cards. Don't buy the book, just make them!All in all, a disappointment."
1,This is the lamest excuse of a Pokemon card game,"What a rip off. Just a bunch of circles, ovals and rectangles. Taking advantage of the Pokemon craze to make money from little kids. Save your money and make sure that the Pokemon stuff you buy is licensed by Nintendo or Wizards of the Coast. I would certainly avoid any other ""books"" by Alexander Gekko."
1,a waste of money,What a waste of money. This was nothing more than a template of rectangles and ovals that anyone could do with Paintbrush. There was absolutely nothing to do with Pokemon. Don't be fooled.
5,LIVE RECORDING OF BIG MAMA THORNTON - 4 Tracks,"This is a cd of 12 live recordings featuring (Sam) Lightning Hopkins and Big Mama Thornton- tracks 1 - 8 are with Lightning Hopkins and tracks 9 - 12 are with Big Mama Thornton. For some reason there is no info at all with the inserts, telling what year or where this concert was held. Lightning Hopkins died in 1982 and Big Mama died in 1984, so it's safe to estimate that this concert was recorded sometime during the 1960's or 1970's. The cover of the cd does feature a replica of the concert poster for the event, but I can't seem to find any info anywhere about these recordings. If anyone knows more info, please provide it here. Thanx."
5,Rubbermaid Tough Tools 70302 12 Foot Tape Measure,"This tape measure is a quality tool. Heavy, easy to read and use. I wanted a lighter tool to carry in my purse, but am certainly not disappointed with this item."
5,The usual from Lite-On: Superb price and great performance,"I've been using Lite On optical drives in homebuilt PCs for several years. Each has worked flawlessly out the box, as did this one. They almost always cost significantly less than similarly performing drives by other manufactures. PLUS: This ships with Nero's burning bundle: in my opinion the best all around. Plus plus: it includes an actual printed user manual that includes well written instructions on the intracies of recording types and dual layer recording. Kudos for this. Lite On never disappoints the upgrader or do-it-yourselfer."
4,Woo Hoo,Bought this used to replace the DVD burner in my ILO DVD recorder. So far it has performed flawlessly. I hope it continues as these are getting harder to find.
2,Recipes don't Match What is Preached,I read this book and it was pretty interesting that what all the world's healthy cuisines have in common is low meat consumption by people who live the longest and with limited disease - meaning having meat only a few times a week or just a small amount to add flavoring to a meal. I got a good laugh at the recipes in the back of the book which were predominantly meat dish recipes - for example - Swedish Cheese-Stuffed Chicken Breasts. The recipes did look yummy though!
3,elanor rigby?!?,"...isn't that a beatles song?...if memory serves me, they had one or two other songs that did quite well"
3,disappointingly ambiguous,"Lillian Gish was lovely , Ann Sothern was delightful ( her perky self),the scenery is well photographed and sustained interest for about half of the movie. The plot,though,was too episodic to make this the experience I had hoped it would afford me.The entire story of the sweet sister(Lillian Gish) being enslaved by the bitter sister(Bette Davis) who then saves her from selfish,charming people(Ann Sothern and Vincent Price) who would take advantage of her sunny nature wore thin very quickly."
2,Yawwwwnnnn....,"This movie's only saving grace was the too short albeit gorgeous scenery. Otherwise, definitely could have passed on it. And where were the whales?"
2,Johnthegrin,"Very poor photography, the acting was very good, the story was okay, did not like the exessive profanity. Did not like it."
5,Bette Davis Marvelous !,Bette's film all the way. As the crabby Libby she domintes Lillian Gish and everyone else in the film. Wonderful story of two sisters in their cottage nearing the end of life.Bette Davis fans will love this.Highly reccommended.I was lucky enough to see this in the theatre.
4,4 giants of acting in their last great roles,"i almost never enjoy plotless all-character talky movies, but this is a rare exception. bette davis and lillian gish as sisters facing their final days, and great supporting work from vincent price and ann sothern. beautifully directed by lindsay anderson. very slow going, not for everybody, but if youve seen or read any chekhov (& liked it), this is a good movie for you."
3,Hard to read,"The book is hard to read. To me, the book is overwritten with sentences that are too long and wordy phrases. Also, the author must be looking at the 70's from the outside in because I lived through the 70's and didn't even recognize the decade? Despite this, I give the book 3 stars because the plot is good."
5,Riveting!!! A must read!!!,"This is the amazing story of Dr. Haefner and his dealings with the past, present, and future. An absolutely unforgettable story filled with drama, action, love stories, adult situations, etc..I could not put this book down. It is aimed at young adult readers, but I think that readers of all ages will truly enjoy this new classic. Being a newer author does not hinder this book one bit. Haefner is very proficient and uses amazing linguistics to truly give the right atmosphere and feelings for every situation. It is a non-stop and very intense book, loaded with themes for all to enjoy. Very highly recommended!!!"
3,still a Glenn Gould fan,"So I've been turned off to romantic music recently after listening to a lot of Bach. Being a Glenn Gould fan, I found this recording to be way too romantic, which is good for certain tastes but but if I wanted to listen to deeply romantic music I wouldn't listen to Bach. There are some good tracks on here so I guess it all depends on what you're looking for. In my opinion, the pedaling is overdone and some of the of trills are blurry or sloppy, which isn't a good way of presenting all the different voices and counterpoint that Bach wrote. In a few tracks, Gavrilov digs deeply into the base and it almost sounds like a Rachmaninoff etude."
4,can use with any design program,"Hashimoto teaches timeless precepts of visual design. Many of which predate the Internet. The book seems apt for someone already knowing something about Photoshop and Illustrator. It shows how to use those programs to apply changes to a design, in accordance with the precepts. But primarily you benefit at a higher level, in understanding through the book's examples how to use basic key ideas in design. Hence, the book is not necessarily restricted to users of those design programs. If indeed you favour another program not covered here, the book can still be very informative.By the way, one chapter uses the example of typeface design. This has an air of antiquity about it. Designing letterforms goes back centuries, and has many subtleties that the chapter lets you appreciate."
2,Lame-oh,"Be very careful to read the system requirements on the box...mine says Windows XP/Vista only! So it won't work in the older versions. On the back side of the box, the 3 screenshots--are about all you get to do. Make pet food, bathe them and kill fleas, all in random mini-games, while you juggle your money to buy more hotel rooms, while not going in the hole. My son and I made it to level 3, then kind of lost interest in ever playing it again. Buy something else instead!"
2,Good Boad for Price but a little too small,"This is a good boat with nice construction however there are few issues that I found with it.1. In order to pump in air, it would be great to have a high pressure pump. I had a swiss gear portable pump battery operated, which came along with a mattress, which didnt do a great job...so i had to top up the boat with some lung power.2. The Boat is really small. Me and my friend both of us are like150 lbs, and still the boat was just barely enough.Other than that. It looks fairly robust and good for boating in ponds and calm lakes. The oars are good and fairly decent,, but one of them developed a crack.Final verdict, not a bad buy for one big person or 2 smaller person for boating in a pond or a lake."
3,Two man boat buily for one,"I would reccomend this product for anyone looking for a boat for one adult. I don't know how they decided to call this a two man boat. It is a good bargain for someone looking to paddle down a small river for recreation or fishing though, The construction is solid and is maneuvers very easily. Good product but misleading title!"
4,inflatable boat review,"I purchased this online before going on a fishing trip back home and then we packed this product into a mountain lake. It was a good product but it is not made for a large adult. This boat will hold a small adult and one child. If your intention is this, you will be satisfied with the product. It also packs well and fits in a backpack; the oars that came with it were sufficient. G.R. Tempe, AZ"
1,Very poor product,The boat was a very poor buy on my part. It kept losing air. I gave it away after the first time I used it. It says that it will hold 2 people. It wouldn't even hold me and all I weigh is 140 lbs
3,Good price...wouldn't pay more,"This vanity stool is nice, not extremely sturdy, but still a good deal at $14.99."
3,"Not really a ""new"" morning","A face-saving release following his disastrous ""Self-Portrait"", Dylan's ""New Morning' is still fairly enjoyable - but oddly underwhelming given the strength of some of the tracks here. ""Day of the Locust"", ""One More Weekend"", ""If Not For You"", and the Coen-resurrected ""The Man In Me"" all deserve inclusion into the Pantheon. However, they're offset by tracks like ""Winterlude"", ""Father of Night"", and the jazzy(!) ""If Dogs Run Free"" that seem mere filler. Moreover, the album doesn't really strike out in any new musical direction (except in ""Dogs"") or reach any great depth but seems more a consolidation - some would say rehashing - of his country and blues phases of the late '60s. Put it this way - ""New Morning"" was Bob's best release between ""Nashville Skyline"" (1969) and ""Blood on the Tracks"" (1975). That makes it one of his best '70s releases (after ""Blood"" and ""Desire"") and meriting a place in any fan's collection."
2,Not a consistant album,This CD does contain some good tracks but is not listenable.I find I skip tracks which is not a sign of a consistent album.One of Bobs weaker CDs.
4,New Morning,"New Morning being the 11 studio album and it was relased by Columbia Records in 1970. This is a good example of Bob Dylan being more laid back. Gone is the politics and anger of his earlier releases. On this album we hear Dylan having fun and I love the track If not for you. I really like the cover photo of Dylan. For once Dylan has picked a competent photographer, i.e., Len Siegler. 4/5."
3,Taking himself less seriously,"While not as finely tuned as some of his stronger compositions, this period shows Dylan having some fun again. It is certainly not amongst his most convincing offerings, but there is a genuine spirit in most tracks, even if he was recycling some past ideas."
3,This one leaves no lasting impression,"This album isn't really bad, but it just fails to leave an impression. It looks like Dylan was uninspired and maybe that's why there are not any outstanding songs on this album. The melodies don't stay with you either. Many of these songs you forget right after you heard them, unlike the splendid ""Blood on the tracks"" album, which is one of his best albums. If you wanna buy this album, do it, it's not that bad, but know that most of his other albums are better (not all of them though..)"
5,"Born-again Dylan -- no cynicism, just upbeat music","I'll say it up front: I'm not a Dylan fan. Yes, he's a brilliant songwriter, he was a revolutionary, etc. but his voice makes me cringe. This album, like ""Blood on the Tracks"" is different. While not of the same caliber as ""BoT,"" ""New Morning"" delivers some poignant, pastoral images and compelling melodies -- one song is about him leaving it all behind for a little cabin in Utah where he'll marry a wife, catch rainbow trout and have a couple kids ""who call me 'Pa'."" The track ""Man in Me"" was featured in the film ""Big Lebowski,"" and if the Coen brothers don't know what's hip, who does?"
3,"Decent Dylan, No Better","This was the first of Bob Dylan's many ""comeback"" albums, necessarily so because ""Self Portrait,"" which preceded it, was so dreadful. Highlights include Bob's version of ""If Not For You,"" the title song, the jubilant and salty ""One More Weekend,"" and the hilarious ""Went to See the Gypsy."" ""Day of the Locust"" is a cynical view of academia, reflecting on Dylan's receiving an honorary degree from Princeton. Other than that, as in ""Went to See the Gypsy,"" a lot goes on here, but very little happens. A big step up from ""Self Portrait,"" but far below the standards Dylan set for himself in the 60's."
5,It's the 70's...again,Classic Bob Dylan. Some of his best in my option from the period. Worth a listen.
4,One of the least understood,"Never rated very highly, this album is one of dylan's most nuanced.I've been listening to it for the past thirty years or so and it consistently astounds me. Not unlike the basement tapes, it takes you into a fictional, weird, and very personal America, to paraphrase Griel Marcus. I don't take to these reviews much, but I've always felt that this album, is in fact one of Dylan's better ""experiments."" Of course, the albums that aren't ""experimental"" are the least interesting"
2,WHY ONLY 2 STARS,"Why only two stars in a great Bob Dylan CD...the reason is that the album is not re-remastered, the sound quality is not as good as it could have been if the album had had the same tratment as Blood on the Tracks and Blonde on Blonde..... and the cd is also silver, without that red beautiful Columbia painting on it.... I guess we should have been warned that this CD, and also the others 2008 Dylan reissues is just it, a reissue, without any sound or grafic improvement.... disappointing for fans such myself, that for a long time has been waiting for a decent record........Marcelo Frota - Rio Grande do Sul - Brazil"
4,new morning,"this is a very good bob dylan album, not great but very good, now remember, a very good bob dylan album is like a great anybody else. first, i will agree with one of the posts that ""the man in me"" is an awesome song, very underrated, worth buying the cd for. winterlude is not far behind it, it's all just different than his previous stuff, but very good, if you like dylan, you'll like this album, and should have it. interestingly, there is no harmonica and maybe the only time we have heard dylan do la, la, las."
5,Up on the Roof with Nyro,"I remember it well: my big sister and I went to Tower Records on Sunset Blvd. the day after Christmas 1980 to buy Laura Nyro's ""Christmas and the Beads of Sweat."" And who was there in the store but Peter Bogdonavich and Cybill Shepherd! I was very young at the time but I still rememeber that day well. And it wasn't because of Peter and Cybill. It's because this music is still so vibrant, vulnerable and magical. ""Freeport,"" ""Blackpatch,"" ""Brown earth,"" ""Up on the roof"" and on and on...songs of love, songs of despair, songs of protest. What maybe people don't know is that Laura Nyro was the consummate musician: she wrote, she played piano, she sang, of course, she produced most of her albums and she wrote the arrangements. When is someone at Columbia/Sony going to realize how important an artist Laura Nyro was and digitally re-master complete versions of at least ""Eli,"" ""Tendaberry,"" ""Christmas"" and ""Smile."" It is long over do."
5,Brand new CD for only $2.00...WOW...,Have been looking for this CD for years...The price was only $2.00 and I had it in just a few Days... Can't beat that... Thanks much... Kevin
1,not what I expected,"This book has about 35 pages about writing thank you's and 100 pages for you to fill in gifts you received. Isnt this usually in the back of your wedding journal anyway? It includes sample notes and good ""buzz"" words to use and also etiquette for exchanging gifts. This book is not really worth buying unless you are really really horrible at writing thank you's. Peruse it at your library or a physical bookstore first. The information within this book is covered in other wedding books & magazines."
3,Pretty basic,"This book, though interesting enough, is about 70% BS. I'm not saying that teleportation does not work, I am still practicing on and off, but the information that is truly needed could fit on less than a dozen pages. When you have a book that is written in bold size fourteen print, and doubled spaced, you know that they really need those extra pages. Putting in six pages of completely pointless full color pictures also probably double the price of the rest of the book. Now I'm not saying don't buy this book, I'm just saying try to find someone you can borrow it from."
2,No Authentic Techniques,"This book was filled with images of dolphins and hippie shit. YOU won't learn teleportation HERE. The only technique provided within this crappy text was ""close your eyes and imagine you're elsewhere""."
3,An nice book,This book was very helpful in explaning teleportation. It gives you the keys you need to learn this art
1,Not worth it...,"I have recently read several vitual and distance management books lately. This one was really a disappointment. Very vague to the point of being hard to apply. Even the writing style and formatting led to a dull read. The book ""The Distance Manager"" was much, much better."
5,"An excellent, clearly written and positive instructional","Trina Hoefling is the founder of Consult One Group, Denver, Colorado, and a professional whose years experience in virtual working included developing one of the first remote training programs. Hoefling draws upon her considerable experience and expertise in Working Virtually: Managing People For Successful Virtual Teams And Organizations to presents examples, definitions, anecdotes, advice, and seasoned wisdom for making the most of telecommunication, teleconferencing, and enabling the team bonding process despite the separation of distance in the modern-day workplace. An excellent, clearly written and positive instructional guide to both personal and technological concerns, Working Virtually is especially commended reading for virtual team leaders, Human Resource managers, CEO's, and corporate trainers."
5,A lady name Belle Prater vanishes from the face of the Earth,"I really, really love this book! It is soooooo cool! It's so neat you'll want to read the ending first. This book is full of mysteries!"
5,Mystery,This book was really easy to read.It also was a nice story about a boy who was crossed-eyed and his mother had dissapered.
4,Excellent Book,I found this book to be excellent. The fact that both children are dealing with the loss of a parent. It is also very insightful as to the coping mechanisms that children use. Both Gypsy and Woodrow lost a parent and in a years time the pain they both experienced was worked through with the help of a true friendship. In today's siciety I'd say everyone could learn somethig about acceptance from this book.
4,A bittersweet story,"I really enjoyed Belle Praters boy for many reasons. It has good and interesting charecters, a really good and mysterious plot and really good morals and values like ""don't judge a book by it's cover."" It's s really good book that you will love!"
2,belle praters boy,I leaned a lot in the book belle prater's boy their was a lot of story lines and drama. The crater was well played out like gipsy. Woodrow. Porter. Belle. And blind Benny. The another Ruth white was a good writer for what I read about her. The book was a great book
3,The Outsider,"I like the part were Gypsy , Woodrow and Blind Benny go out on the rail road picking tihngs up on the garbage.Because there they make a real friend called Blind Benny."
3,Belle Prater's Boy...,I thought Belle Prater's Boy was not the greatest book but it wasn't that bad. The things that made it not my favorite was at points it was really random and disgusting. And it also had a totally unsatisfying ending and really no ending whatsooever. I probably wouldn't have picked the book out to read myself- we read it as a whole grade in school- but then again I might have. But the things that make it not my least favorite is 1 i've read some really bad books that are worse and 2 i loved the sad parts. I guess I've got a thing for sad books. And this at points was definitely one of them.
2,This book is DULLSVILLE!!!!,"I had to read this book for a book report, and if anyone asked me to read it again, I would have to refuse. This book was not only dull, but it had a pretty bad ending as well. It seemed like there should have been at least another two chapters to it. The ending didn't really wrap up the story. The author kept jumping between two different ideas in the story. I could tell that she tried to tie the two ideas together, but she did not do a very good job. In short, if you like dull stories, read this book. If not, skip it and go on to another book."
1,Talk about a waste of time!,"I have no clue how it won the Newberry, but I don't suggest wasting your time on a book that just went in circles. It was awful. In fact, I don't know why I'm wasting my time on it right now..."
3,Belle Prater's Boy,"Belle Prater's Boy, was not the most spectacular novel. Ruth White should've thought twice about the unexciting and boring language she used in this book. Belle Prater's Boy written by, Ruth White, was scripted with not enough graphic language, it was terribly boring. The characters had weird names which were hard to follow up on, while reading the book. The was she worded the words were not easy to understand. I do not recommend this book for readers who like action packed novels. If you like the kind of book that deeps you awake, at the end of your chair, and ready to read more, then this is not the book for you."
2,Not Worth Anyone's Time,"The story started off O.K, so I continued reading it. Gypsy is a character who I didn't particularly like, and same with Woodrow. I read on, expecting to read the thing that I wanted to find out so badly about the book, but I didn't find it. Instead, I found that the author didn't know how to pull her story to a good conclusion. That is why this book was not worth anyone's time."
5,Lovely Book,"I enjoyed the characters, especially when they told jokes. I felt sorry for Woodrow and his family, and I guess that was the author's point. I liked the way she tied everything up in the end, specifically Gypsy's nightmare and Belle's disappearance. Well-worth the Newbery honor."
3,If I read one more book about a parent who disappears...,"I'm gonna scream. And it is all taken way too lightly, and too easily is forgiveness given. Abandonment by a parent is like the hardest thing in the world for a kid, and scars that kid for life (just ask some of the kids in my class). That it happens to a poor kid in this book doesn't make it any easier. Decent writing, but...you see my point."
5,Great book,A very good book. Loved it. A perfect combo of mystery and action. Very good book. A very lovely book
5,"Great, Charming, Inspiring Book",I greatly enjoyed reading this book. The charming lesson of this book is splendid and this should be recommended reading for adults and children alike! :)
3,sad and touching,I liked this book but it started out slow and then got better in the middle but it was still never that exsiting and the end was just a complete mess of a book. I think that ruend the hole book. I say that book should not of won a award it is just not worth it.
4,Great Book,"I thought the book Belle Praters Boy was great! In the begining it is a little boring but it gets better and better as the book goes on . It's one of those books that you can't put down when you start to read it. Woodrow, on of the main characters wakes up to knowing that his mother dissapeared. He goes to live with his cousin, Gyspsy. She has the same troubles, since her fater died. Through the good times and bad times they become very close friends. The ending is great too!!"
2,Belle Prater's Boy Not for Sensitive Hearts,"The spooky mysteriousness of Belle's disappearance, Gypsy's frightening nighmares, Gypsy's contempt for her stepfather and the rebellious attitude of the children toward adults are not acceptable content for 8 or 9 year olds. The description of Gypsy's father's suicide is particularly gory and unnecessary. I bought this book because it was on a list of novels to be read by my third grader's class. I have also expressed the above opinion to the teacher, but thought this might help another parent before they buy it."
5,Heartwarming Story,"In the coal country of Virginia during the 1950s, Belle Prater just disappears. Her son, Woodrow, comes to live with his grandparents and next door is his cousin Gypsy. Woodrow is a special boy and the lives he touches are changed. Characterizations are beautifully drawn. Told by Gypsy the story reminds me of To Kill a Mockingbird, with the innocence of childhood."
5,best on the market.,"Absolutely the best scraper out there. Easy to use and the absolutely flat blade makes scraping old finish off of delicate furniture easy and almost worry free from gouges. I worried when they changed the design of the handle since my last purchase, but the changes made it even better. And anyone worried about the cost of the product or replacement blades,don't. I refinish furniture for a living and my blades last just about a year, using both sides of course, and i still have a handle I have been using for the last eight years."
4,Good Value,The engineers said that the Bahco-625XXX-Premium-Ergonomic-Carbide worked well. We also purchased the replacement blade's. Together they were a good value for the price.
4,excellent product,"i used this to scrape in the corners awsome tool..., the blades last a long time and it is really easy to handle."
3,not great,"Good sound ,,should have left the wrap around as one solid piece,,,not foldable. Too floppy."
5,Great product! Would be a great present for someone who is,"older. I don't like housework, so this is fabulous for getting those dried spills on the rangetop cleaned with minimal effort. It comes with lots of attachments but I haven't tried them all out yet. This won't do the work for you, but it will make the work a whole lot easier. I went after my range with it with great results, then turned to some dried on spills on the floor and they were a lot easier to clean up than I anticipated. It's worth every penny if housework is just not your thing."
2,Not Very Powerful,"My mom gave me one of these last Christmas. She's 64 years old, and says it makes cleaning easier for her. Well, that may be true, but I've found I can do a MUCH better cleaning job by taking the scrub disk off the unit and scrubbing off the soap scum by hand. The motor isn't nearly strong enough to spin that brush very fast, and if you push down too much to really get a tough spot it stops spinning entirely.I suppose if you're an older adult with a touch of arthritis like my mom this would be very nice to have, but if you've got the strength and stamina to simply scrub your bathroom the old fashioned way, don't waste your money on this."
5,I love this thing!,"My husband bought the scum buster for me and I have to say it's the best present he's ever gotten me. This thing works. I hated cleaning the tub and now it's easy, quick and actually fun. My tub and the bathroom walls haven't looked this good in ages. Now if Black & Decker would just make a similar product for the dishes. Run out and buy this you'll not be sorry."
4,Adequate Power For The Purpose,"I bought this to help me out when I was re-caulking and deep cleaning the shower/bath in our apartment and it really helped me out. I usually just take a brillo bad to the hard-to-clean areas, but all I had to do is hold this down on the area to get it clean. The only thing I would change about it is battery life. 6 hours to charge it enough for 30 minutes isn't very convenient if you have a lot of work to do. I know that it needs to be battery for electric shock reasons, but some sort of power attachment for areas you won't be submerging the scrubber in would be better."
2,Not powerfull enough,"This thing lacks any real power or rotational speed to clean quickly. I took this thing appart to get the head that locks into the cleaning items off. I then put a 1/4"" shaft through the center of it and keyed it so it wouldn't turn. Now I can use the brushes with my 18v cordless drill on high speed to make quick work of cleaning."
4,Cordless bathroom scrubber,"Purchased this several years ago. Have used several times and does the job fine. It does require standing in the shower to clean walls, but the included extension handle does help to increase your reach. Saves some elbow grease. I spray with cleaner first and let sit for awhile, but don't let dry. You can also add your cleaner right on the scrubber sponge attachment. Next time I clean I'm going to try the Lysol peroxide cleaner or vinegar and water. Rinsing the shower walls and doors good with clean soft water before exiting helps a lot too. Have your bathroom fan on for ventilation and your furnace fan on for harsher cleaners (which I avoid) also to add more ventilation."
1,Disapointing,"Here it is the final battle against Onslaught. A lot of Marvel heroes gather to destroy the villian and the result is the most boring climax ever put in a comic book story. Marvel's ""Secret Wars"" saga was better then this. I hope we never see a return of Onslaught."
1,This was very bad writing,"It really was. The whole idea of Professor X going mad clearly came from Bob Harras, not Lobdell, and if you're editor in cheif at the company you can do anything you want, even if it only succeeds in angering more readers then it actually attracts. Another story like this one, and there won't be a Marvel Universe anymore."
1,Awful! Just Static when baby quiet. Shopping for a new one now...,"Got this as baby shower gift prior to the birth of our son. Looks great...we really liked the camouflaged transmitter concept. However, when you turn it on, it's another story. When the baby is crying, we can hear it just fine, but the rest of the time there is incredible static, enough to give one a headache.Stay away from this one....We're shopping for a replacement!"
1,pretty picture frame,"I am on my second one and don't recomend using it with a small child. Some times it workes as if voice activated, some times it stays on, & some times it doesn't work at all and is only good for a picture frame."
1,"One-Word Review: ""Useless""","Multi-word Review: The Authors dance around the issue of actually programming an ActiveX control and only present a ""tutorial"" on how to use ActiveX in an HTML document. In light of the functionality in FrontPage and InterDev to drag-n-drop controls into an HTML document, this book is useless!!"
5,"This C.D. is very relaxing, very similar to George Winston.","When you listen to the cd, you can visualize walking in the woods and reliving your journey through life. I would highly recommend this cd to anyone who would like a peaceful journey."
2,Not the light-hearted read you would expect.....,"I found this collection of stories rather dark and completely lacking in holiday cheer.I'm sure mystery lovers would appreciate the plots and characters, but if you're looking for light-hearted, true meaning of Christmas, love is in the air type stories, than this book is definitely NOT for you."
3,"Poor mix , again","The brass and the organ frequently overpower the choir. If this were well mixed it would be a wonderful Christmas classic. Keep the volume control close, again poor mix."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I was a bit disappointed with this CD. I had thought this CD would be easy to sing along with, but because the orchestra was so loud it made it difficult. I think the sound of the choir should be primarily heard, with a little soft background instrumentals. The orchestra sort of drowns out the voices. I had hoped my kids could learn some of these Christmas carols on this CD, but it's really hard to hear the words that are sung. I wish the choir would enunciate the words more clearly. Lastly, I think several of the songs are a bit too fast (like Joy to the World). I enjoy Christmas music that is sung at a more relaxed pace, so I found it hard to relax while listening to this CD. (The loud orchestra makes it even harder to relax). Silent Night was the only relaxing song on here."
4,A highly personal book,"This book is one man's story of his disillusionment with his religion - Mormonism - and how that led him to leave it. I give this book a high rating for the personal aspect of the story. I rate it a little lower for people looking for the ""secrets"" of the Mormon religion and temple ceremonies. You can find those in other books such as ""The God Makers."""
2,"Maybe you be smart, but you be boring.","Good example of a scholarly-type thinking he is so smart that he deserves to write a book. Borrrrrring!He does describe a lot of things about mormonism, and his viewpoint after becoming one then dropping out, but the overall feeling I got while reading is ""who cares?""."
3,Great fun but------------------,"The guns (well one of them anyway) only lasted for about 30 minutes, after that it no longer squirted water. You could hear that there was water in the gun but it leaked out (from around the trigger mechanism) rather then squirt out the nozzle.............."
2,A Kindle flop,"The only reason I gave two stars is the hope that this book may be of some use in paper format. On the Kindle it is useless for it's stated purpose of providing poems to read out loud. Many of the poems are in extremely small print. One cannot increase the font size. There is some sort of goofy system to ""zoom"" the font. Sometimes it turns the print 90 degrees and enlarges it, sometimes it doesn't. Even when it is of some help it only works for one stanza. Press ""next page"" and you're right back where you started with no ""zoom"". There are helpful comments about each poem, unfortunately they may be inserted in exactly the wrong place. In ""Casey at the Bat"" after Casey swings his first strike come two pages of commentary. Try maintaining a rhythm reading aloud with that!I have public domain volunteer created Kindle poetry that is far easier to read aloud than this. It may work in print but skip it for the Kindle."
5,Good PE Exam Reference Book,"I just passed the October 28th, 2005 PE exam on the first attempt. I used this book and the following 3 to help me study.Electrical and Computer PE Sample Examination (ISBN: 1888577932), Six Minute Solutions for Electrical and Computer PE Exam Problems (ISBN: 1888577754), and PE Sample Questions and Solutions: Electrical and Computer Engineering by NCEES (ISBN: 1932613110)This book consolidates most of the Electrical PE exam material into one reference, but of course it does not cover every type of question you may see on the exam. IMO, the more exam type questions you see the better. This book will also serve as a useful technical reference throughout your career. JMO."
4,helpful but not sufficient,"I took and passed the PE in the fall of 2006. I think this reference book is definitely worth having in your possession on the exam (at least for the morning session). It provides a concise overview of most of the important topics on the exam. However, I was NOT satisfied with the many sample exams and additional problem sets available. For this reason, I decided to generate my own sample PE exam and to provide it free-of-charge (at klkaiser)."
2,Wasted money,Nice looking piece of junk. It does hold just about any tripod. Easy to access and looks relatively decent.Problem is that it is cheaply made. Top area of handle tore off carrying it in after the third outing. Plastic/nylon feeling. No longer usuable. Now looking to replace it with something of substance.
3,beware - sizing is way off!,"This is a nice item, but the sizing is way off. I ordered a medium - I am a petite size 8 - and it only fit my daughter, who is a size 0-2. What on earth is wrong with the sizing??"
5,A Special Feel . . .,"This Slide Hampton recording has a wonderful aura around it. Hampton's affection for the people he performs with on this disk comes through on this lyrical, haunting, and exciting album. It's tasteful and it shows Slide Hampton's respect for music and the youthful musicians on this CD. Keiko Lee's number is haunting -- I'd like to hear more of her."
3,Pobre sonido,"Esta grabación es, evidentemente, pirata y sorprende mucho que,siendo de 1.973, pueda tener un sonido tan pobre. Uno no deja de sufrir un tanto (no demasiado) a lo largo de su escucha pues parece estar perdiéndose todos los detalles sutiles. Las interpretaciones, en sí, son buenas y yo destacaría un excelente rey Thoas y, también, un sentido del ""pathos"" que nunca me ha parecido habitual en Gardiner (muy bien aquí en ese sentido); la grabación es en vivo (toses incluídas); buen disco complementario."
3,"GOOD MUSIC, BAD SOUND","This release compiles the 17 tracker first IOFilth lp Onward Christian Soldiers with a slew of 7s and a cassette. Lyrics are great anarcho-pacifist but the music is very basic and failed to give me the rush I usually look for on this kind of record. The non-lp songs are way better than the lp ones and have better sound, esp the guitarwork. I bought this coz I'd liked the 'Nostradamnedus cd so much but it turned out to be just OK punk rock with awful sound. What annoyed me the most is that except for the On Her Majesty's Service ( a few songs ) there is a strong treble imbalance that deafens your right ear, which my eq failed to correct. Maybe that's been sorted on the remaster ? But that one has only the lp tracks.This one clocks in at a healthy 60+ so there's plenty to choose from. Buy at your own risk. Stig RIP :-( ."
4,"Great peace-punk, influened by Crass, & Antisect","Great work....sounds like late-Crass/ Flux of Pink Indians.Recommened for Peace-Punks, and Eco-Anarchists everywhere!"
3,For enthusiasts,"Just under 80 early blues songs are in this book, as is a lavishly illustrated (the photos are black and white, but still wonderful) introduction to the blues. It's obvious that this has been cobbled together from a few different sources, but anyone after fastidious consistency in a book of blues songs is a bit odd.There are a few songs here that don't seem to be many other places, and the piano arrangements are, for the most part, simple and ready for ornamentation and adaptation to other instruments. Worth getting if you're a blues fan."
4,Good Read,I thought that it was a good book. It had a good mixture of suspence and romance. I am now going to go back and read the rest of the series.
4,crazy kisses,this was a light read . It was fun and was light hearted. I would read more of this authers books.
4,Crazy Kisses,I love Kid and Nicole. Their story is great and very entertaining to read. All the Steele Street guys are fabulous.
5,Crazy kisses,"This is a wonderful book. I liked the excitement. When I started to read the book, I couldn't put it down. Excellent"
2,Very dumb,"Don't bother to read this book, it's not worth your time. I found the story very disappointing and totally unbelievable."
1,Not impressed with the language,"I can't review the author's plotlines, character development, or ability to draw in the reader. I didn't make it past the first few paragraphs. The language was such a turnoff that I deleted it from my Kindle after turning to the second page. It's not that I can't handle reading a swear word, but there are many, many fabulous authors who can write a compelling story without resorting to foul language. The first few paragraphs alone contain four different obscenities, and that's if you don't count 'whore' as a swear word.If you like that kind of thing, great--I'm sure this is the book for you. I don't use that kind of language, though, and neither do the people I live and work with, and I'd rather not see it repeatedly in print. I wish there was a way to note whether or not a book is full of swear words, because I wouldn't have bothered with downloading this one if I'd known."
5,Excellent reference book,Toy Soldiers and Figures is an excellent reference for the collector's library. Great coloured photos with a good sampling of figures available. Price guide is a useful reference to value your collection and for buying and selling purposes. Limited factual information but the excellent photos make up for it.
2,Sweet Harmony,"This was a good, Christian based book. No sex. A few kisses, with two people ending up in love, even though the path there is quite short and a bit unbelievable. They didn't even date. Just a few encounters over the course of a few weeks. This was okay, but I would have liked more interaction between the two characters rather than just having them realize their love at the end."
3,its a good but crappy phone,i own this phone and the charger dont work right my phone beeped at me after 3 months and is in for service and has no games
1,terrible,"Never received the item and was unable to track it. Although they provided a tracking number,it wouldn't track. This was recommended by our doctor.Terrible purchase. Threw my money away and what recourse is there."
2,Stealing from others,"This is a poor barbra album for a few reasons: She doesn't seem comfortable with the material and others have recorded much better versions of these songs. She basically steals Laura Nyro's arrangement for ""Stoney End,"" and she attempts to steal ""Just a Little Lovin'"" and ""No Easy Way Down"" from Dusty Springfield. Laura and Dusty's performances are much, much better. Compare the two versions of ""No Easy Way Down"" (Dusty's is on ""Dusty in Memphis) and you'll see that Dusty internalizes the lyrics beautifully to evoke the sadness of the song, while Barbra struggles to evoke anything. Barbra sounds stiff and uncomfortable with many of the songs. I read in an interview that she said she had a hard time learning to sing on the beat while making this record. It definitely shows too. Now, before I get lots of hate mail, I am a fan of Barbra, she definitely has a voice. But this is one record in which the elements do not come together. Not everything that she puts out is like butter."
4,"Alternate Title: ""Barbra in Memphis""","This album of richly sung tunes reminds me of the late Dusty Springfield's 1969 album ""Dusty in Memphis"" not only because it shares a couple of songs,but, like ""Memphis"", it too creates a rich mood and sound that is both diverse and cohesive. Stoney End presents Barbra with a soulful and relaxed style we hear all too infrequently. This is the perfect Streisand cd for even the non-Streisand fan."
4,Stoney Barbra,Another great Streisand album with a more contemporary feel. A few lesser known songs included but still well worth a look
5,ABFAB BARBRA,"This was yet another turning point in Miss S.'s career -it proved she could sing rock and soul , and , that she could sing it in a laid back seventies rock style ( hard to believe given some of her more recent diva laiden offerings).The CD opens with the beat number "" Free The People"" which is probably more appropriate than the original LP opener ""I Don't Know Where I Stand"" (although this is a beautiful ballad performance and an all time favourite of mine). Barbra moves through soul, rock and ballads effortlessly on this album ( "" No Easy Way Down"" is to Soul what ""Don't Rain On My Parade"" was to Broadway).Simply, this is Barbara at her best.... and that's some BEST."
5,"A key read and addition to any history or biography collection, highly recommended","One of the great mathematicians and philosophers, the life of Pythagoras serves as a history of classical thinking. ""Pythagoras: His Life and Teachings"" looks at the man who is most known for his work in the fields of mathematics and philosophy, but did much in many other intellectuals fields of the time. From religion to nutrition, Pythagoras pursued anything his mind drifted too and much of his discoveries still hold true to this day. ""Pythagoras"" is a key read and addition to any history or biography collection, highly recommended."
4,Gregg Rollie is one half of the best Santana band ever,"Roots is not as good as the first three Santana albums, it's not as good as Abraxas Pool or even Gringo but it's close. It sounds more like Santana (the group) than anything Carlos has done lately.Please Carlos call Gregg and Neal and Chepito and put the band back together !Gregg Rollie is the most underappreciated man in rock. He left the best incarnation of Santana to form Journey and eventually left to form Storm and do some great solo stuff, the best of which was Gringo. Roots is no Abraxas but it's as close as we'll get for now."
4,Gregg Rolie - Roots,"In this almbum Gregg can't hide the rock-afro-latin influence he kept along all these years and since he played with Carlos Santana.Good album in general, he is also surrounded by good musicians, which is pretty obvious as listening the high-quality album cuts."
5,All his solos are great,"I have loved his voice and writing style since the very beginning. Also Check out his Self titled cd ""Gregg Rolie"" and ""Gringo"""
4,Delightful book for children,"This 1974 Little Golden Book Eager Reader series book is delightful. Petunia, the youngest in a family of elephants who speak and live in a house, is an avid roller skater. Her parents think it unseemly for an elephant to skate and in turns, each family member hides Petunia's skates in some secret place but next day she is back skating again.Jerry Scott's illustrations are wonderfully whimsical. Suitable for a child of any age who knows what skates are."
2,Merrell sawtooth - disappointment,I bought the boots because I spend a lot of time in the woods. After about six months of use and an especially soggy day one of the swivels broke out of the leather.Overall the boot did not preform to merrill standards. What good is a tough sole and breathability if you can't keep the thing on because the eyelets for the laces have fallen out?
5,Uplifting,A short but powerful book by the author that inspires us to dwell not in our knitty-gritty stuff that clogs our life but to surrender what we have to God. Suitable piece for young & old. One you could read over and over as a prayer.
1,Fraudulent Scheme,"Great concept! Original idea...NOT! This movie was stolen from it's original director. The content, title, photographs and footage were used unlawfully and should have never been released. It's unfortunate that some ""film makers"" capitalize off of the hard work and artistic vision of others. The tradition of Black Cowboys is a unique subculture that has had little acknowledgment in American history. It is unfortunate that a misappropriated film like this is getting exposure."
1,disappointed,This was my first time using this seller and I was very disappointed in the merchandise. I put the cd in my machine and what came up was an error message...that said this cd may not have playback capabilities. I was disappointed after spending my money and wanting to impress my grandson with the black cowboys. I am sending it back.
5,My favorite Lee novel,"Of all of Lee's many fine horror novels, Coven is far and away my favorite. It is gruesome, horrifying, demented, perverse, and, very often, hysterically funny. As another reviewer indicated, the cover of the old mass-market edition is quite misleading and not indicative of what awaits the reader. Scenes of depravity are written with gleeful gusto. This is gonzo horror writing, sort of a mad synthesis of 70's and 80's b-horror movies, the sensibility of a Hunter Thompson or Douglas Adams, Animal House, and more. I also enjoyed the references to many of Lee's favorite imported beers of the time. Mr. Lee published three novels before Coven (two under the pseudonym Philip Straker), but I consider this the true beginning to his career--this is where his reputation as the king of ""extreme"" horror began. Used copies can be costly, but it's worth seeking out. Or you could hold out for the new limited edition hardback due from Necro Publications in 2003."
4,Oldschool Edward Lee,"Coven was originally published in 1991 and re-released by Necro in 2005. This is Edward Lee's second book -- his first was Ghouls (1988) -- and you can easily see how he began writing extreme horror with this one.For the most part, it's an awesome book; I loved the setting of a college campus and the town Exham. The story unfolds at a fast pace and is full of twists and turns. Although I lost a bit of interest in the third act because it veered a tad too much into sci-fi. I would've preferred the sci-fi element to be kept to a minimum. The characters reminded me of me and my friends when we were in college, drinking beer and partying. The H.P. Lovecraft references are numerous and fun to spot. There's a lot of technical discussions pertaining to forensics and scientific issues which felt a bit forced at times.Overall, Coven is a good read and one that I would recommend to any Lee fan. If you like sci-fi as well as horror, then you'll probably enjoy it even more than I did."
1,Maybe you REALLY have to be into Lovecraft & Imported Beer,"Just did not enjoy this book. I finished it to see what he was going to do with these characters. The characters are very one dimensional, and I just do not buy how Lee plays things out. There is no story here, just some provocative scene sketches. This particular tale seems to have a lot of RAPE obsession thrown in, yet written so that the victims LIKE it. Yeah. Great.Lots of gory goo- but not scary, not creepy. Just gross.Did someone say Lee is the heir to Stephen King's throne? I think not."
5,One of Lee's Best!,"Just finished reading Coven on the Kindle. This has been one of Lee's older books that I've been meaning to read for some time now. With the quick download on amazon I was able to start reading this book in no time and let me tell you once I started this book I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN until I finished it. This book has it all: great likable characters, suspense, mystery, violence, sex and a coven full of nasty things waiting to devour everything in its path. I even noticed a few themes that reminded me of Lee's Infernal series. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this title to any fan of horror."
3,Ed Lee Fan,"I was looking forward to reading this earlier book of Lee's as I have become a late comer to his books. Well I found it a little disappointing with a rather juvenile prose regarding the characters. It was one of thosr books you pick up read a few pages and put down again when in the mood, Iam hoping Succubus and Incubus will be more to my liking"
1,NOT THE BEST OUT THERE,"I was excited to purchase this travel mug for tea with strainer as a gift, but I ended up sending it back. When you read the instructions on the side regarding the water shouldn't be too hot, it's a misnomer as you want hot water for tea and hopefully it will stay hot for awhile. So, maybe there was a typo in the literature, but not wanting to take chances I returned it. In my search there are better tea travel mugs with strainers, I discovered one in a store and didn't have to pay shipping charges.Also, may I add, it's not fun to return an item, you have to incur shipping charges and they charge you a re-stocking fee, yikes that's like paying for an additional gift that you don't have!"
2,Not happy,"I had such high hopes for this travel mug. Sounded great with the large mesh basket for fresh loose tea. The lid is a push on type, it doesn't screw on and the darn thing leaks constantly when you tip it up to drink. I'm giving this an extra star for the basket inside. Don't buy this unless you like wearing your tea instead of drinking it."
2,It's Plastic :(,I didn't realize it was plastic. I didn't think in this day in age with all we know that a mug for a hot beverage would be made of plastic. I sent it back and did not give it as a gift.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this product for my husband so that he could brew fresh tea when at work.We were disappointed to find that the lid barely stayed on, and that it leaked constantly whe he would drink from it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS AWFUL!!!!"
3,An abbreviated glimpse at British slang that puzzles readers,"Jann Turner-Lord's ""Bob's Your Uncle"" is a slender volume of only 62 pages, yet it is often humourous and informative. With this decryption tool, you can now appreciate paragraph's such as: ""That Henry! He is always acting off his own bat! All mouth and no trousers, ever since he was a sprog; he should really consult a trick cyclist!I mean sure, sometimes his manners can be all gas and gaiters, but yesterday I just wanted him to naff off. I think I will just put on my plimsolls and scarper over to his house and tell him not to get so shirty. And don't worry, I promise not to let it turn into a slang-match!""You can bet your sosh that this book will better prepare you for reading books by British authors, or Bob's Your Uncle!"
2,"Good idea, weak execution","The idea of a gel grip on a quality pen sounds like a slam dunk winner. I have 3 of these guys and I can tell you that winner they are not. First, the refills (kind of a basic feature) are from Fisher and are the pressure type and not very good. Every one I have blobs if I write a lot. Next, the gel on one leaked and made a mess in my wife's purse (she was not happy). And the design strikes me as a little crude in comparison to the high price. Not a great value and I'll never buy another. I think the idea has merit but the execution is still in need of some work."
4,Very good,"I have been using Sensa for several years and Fisher Spade pen for 30 years - the first original is still in use.It all depends on use. For everyday purposes you use whatever happens to be handy. Fisher is excellent if you have to write standing up against a wall or on an uneven surface.Sensa is the best for students and professors (like me) using a lot of longhand. After half an hour writing you really start appreciating.For purses and trouser pockets small Fisher is good. All ballpoints and gels cause terrible damage without cap in shirt pocket. It is a bit like using a fountain-pen, which I did until recent years.Sensa looks like a gimmick, but it is really good value."
5,ultimate shotokan karate book,"This is an excellect book from a true karate master! It covers all the traditional shotokan katas from beginner through brown belt (demonstrated by various Canadian competition champions), with tons of great pictures and details. There are numerous photos explaining the basics techniques and stances, and each kata is followed by ippon and sanbon kumite derivations, and even detailed bunkai demonstrations from master Okuyama himself! I can't wait for the next edition!"
5,TLC...... NEED I SAY MORE,TLC IS THE BEST GROUP THERE EVER WAZ AND EVER WILL BE. I DONT EVEN NEED TO RATE THIS VIDEO U KNOW ITS THE BOMB. TLC I LUV U
5,it's the best video ever,If you got any sense you know TLC rox baby. Left-eye can rap like no other and Chili and T-boz got the stuff. i am the ultimate TLC fan.
4,Boss BR900CD Excelent product,"This product is great and a dream for AMATEUR musicians who record alone, that is, I do not have so much time to practice with a band and record so this product gives the chance to integrate drums, bass simulators and a lot of effects.Not that easy to use if you have never record before but for sure reading the manual/ watching tutorials is a great help to explode everything it hasI am very happy with it, very recomendable"
4,Good from SV...back to the old,"This CD is a very good mix of some Slum Village new and old. I actually played this album more than I did SV.I really wish that El and T-3 would get back with Baatin. I miss him in the group. Yes I have much love for SV, this group has been through alot of changes. I want T-3 and El to make another classic with Baatin. Especially now that JayDee has passed on, as a tribute to Jay.This album is worth purchasing because it reminds you so much of the material SV put out when produced by Jay Dee and also offers a taste of some new production from Gunna.Slum is a very innovative and unique group which I love and I hope they keep producing quality material. They are my ""Sequel"" to A Tribe Called Quest""."
1,~~~~Prequel to some garbage~~~~~,"I waited 5 weeks for this cd from Barak Records, they lost my order, and wouldnt return my calls when I called to check on it. Finally.....after 6 times and a call to paypal, I got the cd. I should have cancelled this after 3 weeks, but my love for slum village kept me determined...I waited and waited and nothing...a prequel to some garbage finally arrived~The Cd is full of old material, hurried unfinished with no substance. The best song #5 feat Dwele, is only 48 seconds and they cut it off while it was still playing (no pun to Dwele, he's always doing his thang) This is absoulty the worst 17.00 I spent in my life..shoulda bought it on Amazon and saved 50% for this crap!!"
4,Am I REALLY that good?,"This book is a good book for poetry lovers. I have this book and found a lot of really good poems in it. But I also found some poor, obvious joke, poems in this book. I am a poet myself who has a poem published in this book as well and Nature's Echoe's and Poetry's Elite 2000, and I'm only 16. This makes me wonder if I'm as good as I hope I am or this company just publishes every poem they recieve. But as far as the book goes, it's good."
2,Dog Collar,"When I got the product at first I liked it and it looked good on my beagle Spark Plug. I also liked it because it was an adjustable collar. On the down side where I set the adjustment on the collar it constantly moves so I have to move it back which is VERY ANNOYING. I have never had a dog collar do that. Also it looks like it was made with cheap components which would explain alot. I have three dogs and went thru alot of collars, but this is the most troublesome one I have had. The only reason I got it was because it was a Cincinnati Reds collar and it was an adjustable. Too bad I can't get my money back!"
3,"OK, but not Jerry's Best","Writing as a Jerry Vale connoisseur, the only two songs on this CD that are given the true Vale treatment of emotion and full voiced high notes are ""Non Ti Scordar Di Me"" and ""Amore Scuzami"". While the rest are beautifully orchestrated, Jerry's vocals are weaker than normal with too much vocal vibrato. It sounds as though he's concentrating on getting the Italian lyrics correct more than he's paying attention to the emotional values of each song. Consequently, with most of the songs, he sounds unsure of what to do next, and unfortunatley his voice comes across lacking emotion and it's usual perfection. The normal smile in his voice is not there.A better choice would be his CD ""Jerry Vale Sings the Great Italian Hits"". There you will find Jerry's recordings bright, energenic, and powerful."
4,Good,Starts to get a little different than the first two seasons. Depressing finale. Makes you wonder if there could be a season 4. Still is enjoyable and fun to watch though.
4,The O.C. continues,"The collection is beautifully packaged and the quality of the dvd's is very good. The 3rd season was a bit of a disappointment as there seems to be more and more ""unpleasant"" characters in the series and fewer of the nice and positive ones. The best part centres on the relationship between Summer and Seth, and Summer in particular proves to be the only shining funny and clever character of the movie. My teen-age daughter is a great fan of the series but I personally think that certain ""stereotypes"" should be avoided or at least become more faceted(the poor rich girl who faces great emotional problems and turns to bad companies...Marissa, get a life!). All in all, the series still retains a great visual impact and the ""adult"" characters are still fascinating and very well played."
2,The O.C has gone down hill,Compared to season's 1 & 2 this season is pathetic.. the story line drags on and it just isn't good.. i watched the whole thing waiting for it to get better but it didn't happen. i'm only buying this box set because i have 1 & 2 and i want to finish the set.. The end of this sucked the most.. if you havn't watched it yet you will be dissapointed!!!!!!!
1,yeah absolutly adis OC,i was addicted to OC but since this season has started have a downfall and i realized that we should watch sth like dawson's creek its the best programe you can ever watch guys its a real life its nothing like that stupid rich brats i hate this show espicially when marissa dies WHY ? and how is that stupid girl who is Ryan's new girlfriend isnt she the liar of the story?? i think john couldnt find anything to write.... even my friends(who are more addicted than me)doesnt watch it anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!if you really want to watch something good sth real sth related to our lives watch dawson's creek or desperate housewives you won't regret . .
3,No English Subtitles???,What's with Warner not including English Subtitles on their dvd releases any more?? I guess I'll be saving money from now on and not purchasing these sets. All/most Warner sets in the past have had them and now they stopped. Why??
3,not feelin it..,"I'm a huge OC fan and followed the show. HOWEVER, is it only me or am I just not feeling the spark that the first season had? I mean, where is all the humor???? The producers and writers are put to blame here for taking the shows orginality and replacing it with stupid crap throughout the entire season. The music also sucks. It's just filled with stupid whiny junk with the exception of Imogen Heap. It was also quite dissapointing because once one bad character left, another one appeared! What is up with that??? We can only take so many crappy characters in a row!! I was used to the old, mellow, laid back, witty humor with some drama thrown in. What happened to that? Well, I was kind of sad that Marissa died because she was most of the shows plot but also happy because she and Ryan had already broken up anyways. Let's hope in season 4 they have more humor, less sadness."
1,love the show,"I love this show, Ryan justs draws you in. My daughter and two nieces got me to watch the first episode and then I got hooked so we watch all the entire seasons one and two and I can't wait for season 3 and you bet I will be watching this season."
1,ROFLMFAO... FINALLY THIS SHOW IS DYING... ROFLMFAO...,"A few episodes of the second season and the third season of The O.C. is such a waste of time! It's so slow, slow, slow, slow and super slow. Such uninteresting, tiring, exhausting, repetitive and stupid storylines. What junk! I WASTED MORE THAN 25 HOURS OF MY LIFE WATCHING THIS STUPID SEASON! THE WEATHER CHANNEL IS BETTER THAN THIS CRAP! FOX SHOULD'VE CANCELLED IT! THIS WILL BE THEIR BIGGEST REGRET AFTER THEY FIND OUT THAT ONLY 100,000 PEOPLE TUNED IN TO WATCH THE SERIES FINALE WHICH I KNOW WILL BE THE WORST EVER! STUPID SHOW WITH STUPID STORYLINES WITH STUPID CHARACTER WITH STUPID GRADUATION ON STUPID EPISODES WITH STUPID SEASON FINALE THAT WILL HAVE A STUPID FOURTH SEASON! I'M SO HAPPY MARISSA DIED BUT I WISH EVERYONE ELSE INCLUDING RYAN AND SETH DO TOO! DON'T BUY THE STUPID THIRD SEASON! BUY THE FIRST AND BE HAPPY! THE FOURTH SEASON WILL GET CANCELLED AFTER THE THIRD EPISODE AND I'LL BE ROLLING ON THE FLOOR LAUGHING!!!"
2,The cover looks familiar???,"Even though the show is on a downfall, hoping to end soon, the cover looks vaguelly familiar. Oh, yes. It looks like Friends. Not only is one of the worst shows trying to look like one of the best shows, it doesn't help to copy artwork from the cover of a friends season DVD set!"
2,This is the season that made the show unwatchable...,"The first season was great because it didnt take itself too seriously. Two was good but you could see the signs of aging and season three you get plot lines with evil corrupt one demensional Deans at school and Con-Womn trying to get the Cohen's money. Where did they get this stuff? I hated to do it but the writers and Producers gave us no choice. Obviously many felt the same as reatings dipped significantly and the show was almost cancelled.Ashame that a once great show took such a strong dip in quality. If you are a fan of the first season, then don't buy this or the second season. Save your money and buy quality TV on DVD like Weeds or Entourage."
1,the show keeps getting worse and worse.....,"The show started off really good and had a lot of potential, but it keeps getting worse. First the story line is pretty predictable and some of the characters are annoying. Don't waste your money, try another teen drama like One Tree Hill or Veronica Mars."
2,The O.C. got lost !,"I'm just wondering what to do with my Season 1 and 2 DVDS ...This Third Season started well till the 7th episode, after that you say ""What the hell is that?"", dont need to mention the last episode ... O.C. is over ! I won't buy it at all ! They've ruined the show, you can bet that the 4th season will be the last ... thats a shame cause it used to be my favorite show!"
1,The worst season!!,The first season was good and the second season was okay but the third ist so bad. I don't like it at all. So no need to bye it.
1,"""Head cheese with mayo? What's the prooooblem?""","So, the good old O.C. has finally bit the dust. People, at long last, stopped caring about the ""problems"" of a bunch of whiny rich brats. Ever since the only worthwhile aspect of the show, Mischa Barton, went bye-bye, people realized this show sucks.Say it with me folks: THE TREND IS OVER AND GONE FOREVER!!However, I do look forward to seeing Mischa Barton in more projects. I believe she has a good future ahead of her. I also look forward to seeing that beady-eyed blond-haired kid with the schnozz servin' up piping hot fast food at your local Hardee's.ROT IN PIECES O.C. 2003-2007AND GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD RUBBISH!"
4,Great Show!,"I have already seen then entire series of the show, but have been working on buying the seasons for myself. It is a great show to curl up on the couch and have a marathon on a cold cloudy day! Lots of drama to keep you interested."
4,I loved this show since the beginning,"Season one of the O.C. was amazing. Season two was okay. Season three started off slow, i must admit... but the second half was great. i would buy this season just for its finale."
2,Gruesome & Dark,"If you like edgy and dark stories about roid-rage, you might find this to your liking. But it can be an unpleasant read for those not into this particular type of story."
3,A good mystery.....,I liked the story line but it was a little dragged out..I did get hooked and couldn't put it down in some chapters ...towards to end it was just to lengthy before the wrap up.
5,Hard to put this book down.,"Great reading and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Wasn't expecting some of theevents that occurred, but they certainly added to the suspense of the story."
2,surprise,"This book is really good, has you guessing what is going on right up until the end. I would recommend this to all."
1,Didn't get through it,WOW! This was hard to read. Not really sure what the point was. I seldom stop reading a book even if it is bad. Just could not finish this one.
2,Book,"I was disappointed with this book. I thought it was a ""reading"" book, and when I received it, it is a coloring book. I would not have ordered it I had known it was a coloring book."
2,If Only It Were Funny,"A play named Urinetown. An opening called ""Too Much Exposition."" A story revolving around the right to pee for free. Sounds like the makings of a funny, funny show.Unfortunately, it's not. It's heavy-handed and preachy, which would be fine, if only the show were funny. I am amazed as I listen that this show does not even make attempts at real humor. I never laughed once while listening to this disc.There are some redeeming qualities. The cast is good, and the score's a refreshing homage to the classics of theater. But on the whole, I wouldn't recommend this show to any but the most devoted of musical theater fans"
2,Eh...,"I can't believe this moved up to Broadway while [the far superior] Bat Boy never made it! Urinetown is, like it's obnoxious title, pretty awful. Usually, I enjoy a musical that dares to be different, so when I heard of Urinetown, I bought a copy of the cast recording without having seen the show before.Here's what I thought:As with most musicals, there are a couple of winning songs (Look At The Sky, Act One Finale) but the majority are barely listenable. I'm sorry but for me, a musical needs at least nine good songs in order to redeem itself, not just two or three. Now, it has an interesting plot but that doesn't make up for the BAD singing (with the exception of Hunter Foster), annoying voices (Jennifer Laura Thompson, John Cullum), horrible lyrics, and true let-down of an ending. I give this original cast album two stars for effort.Check out Wicked, Aida, or even Seussical if you want a musical that delivers."
1,I'm not sure I liked any of this score!,"I gave this score a couple of listens, but now it is relegated to the ""never to be listened to again"" pile."
4,"Great Music, Okay Recording","The performers, orchestrations, and Mark Hollmann's score for this Off-Broadway turned Broadway musical are excellent, 5-star. Unfortunately the recording is a little echo-y for my taste and the recording loses a star for that. I've seen the show on Broadway and it's great, I might go see it again soon."
3,Not for Everyone,"This musical is a great piece for the 21st century no doubt, that being said it takes some getting used to. The musical cannot be taken at face value, there are lots of things happening under the surface and it takes some bites at things musical theater doesn't usually take, like itself. On the surface it is strange, and not really something people would listen to over and over. However, once you figure it out, it's fun to listen to it again to find all the things that are really going on. It is very funny, and says some good things about the current state of the world. For musical theater fans this is questionable, if you just like the toe-tapping happy go lucky feel, this isn't it. But if you like the social commentary that goes along with that toe tapping, this is a must. NOT FOR FIRST TIME BROADWAY LISTNERS. Favorite Song: ""Look at the Sky"""
5,very pleased,"When searching for this I was told I had great taste, but no one has it anymore. You did and it was a greta gift for a great girl"
4,One of the most unique musicals ever written,"It's one of those shows that the more lyrics you know, the funnier it gets. It mocks the audience, while simultaneously assuming that the audience is well educated and a regular theatre goer, who would understand the sutler jokes."
3,I wanted so badly to like it...,"Having just bought the ""Bat Boy"" soundtrack and loved it, I figured ""Urinetown"" would give me the same satisfaction: that offbeat, goofy-but-emotional, well-written, ""New Broadway"" allure.Unfortunately, Urinetown's music fails to carry through. There is simply nothing notable about these songs. There is nothing to feature as THE song from Urinetown. Nothing is catchy enough to get stuck in your head. Nothing keeps your attention for more than a minute.""Urinetown"" is no ""Producers."" It's no ""Rent,"" it's no ""Bat Boy,"" it's no ""Rocky Horror."" It's a show that had so much potential to be funny and touching and genuinely GOOD, but the chanty, uninspired music ruins that potential. Still, I reccommend keeping it in your collection as a novelty or an example of ""New Broadway."""
2,THIS Won a Tony?,"You could say I had a ""Urinetown"" birthday this year. I got both the CD and tickets to see the show at the Henry Miller in NYC. I have seen dozens of shows -- both on and off Broadway -- and this ranks near or at the bottom of the heap, though the performers were quite wonderful. The problem: music was wholly forgettable, in one ear and out the other. Since seeing the show, I have repeatedly played the CD, figuring it would grow on me. It hasn't. Meanwhile, I recently went to see ""Thoroughly Modern Millie,"" which, to my surprise, turned out to be one of the best, biggest musicals I have ever seen. How the Tony Award folks could honor ""Urinetown's"" book and music over ""Millie"" is a mystery. My recommendation: Skip this CD and skip the show when it schleps to your city."
3,"Good, but Over-Hyped","I purchased this cd after reading numerous ""glowing"" reviews.After listening a couple of times, however, I feel this score was a bit over-hyped.Certaining, there are enjoyable moments & the premise is interesting, but there are only a few songs that are memorable:UrinetownDon't Be The BunnyRun, Freedom, Run!Maybe you had to see the show?"
5,"So wonderful and so, so wrong","It's original, it's bold, it's hilarious, it's lovingly wrong. It's ""Urinetown"". For anyone who insists the American Musical Theatre is dead, let them hear this CD. From the opening to the finale, with titles like ""Too Much Exposoition"", ""Priveledge to Pee"", ""Don't Be The Bunny"", and ""Snuff That Girl"", it's an experience unlike any other and reaffirms your faith in the future of American Musical Theatre. Fans of the CD who were unable to catch the show's too-short Broadway run should see this show on tour, if you can. It's unbelievable! One of the few shows that is worth every penny of the ticket price."
2,Exhaustive research?,"I was given this book by a friend who knows of my love for Caruso's music. The industry reviews on this page talk about the ""exhaustive research"" done by the author. I had to put the book down after page one: within three paragraphs, the author repeats one of the most preposterous lies about Caruso's life, that his mother had 17 previous children who died within a year of their birth. Then I flipped back to the dust flap, where it claims that Caruso performed ""an astonishing 37 major roles each year"" at the New York Metropolitan Opera. Newsflash: Caruso's mother did not lose 17 children: Enrico (Errico) was the third of seven children. And no tenor every performed 37 different roles in one year, let alone EVERY year. To accomplish the latter, the Met would have had to run performances 52 weeks a year, with Caruso changing roles every 10 days for 17 years. How can one trust a book that makes mistakes like that before you even get to page 2?"
5,amazing beat wreckage,"Wow is all I can say. The first time I heard ""Am I Sound Boy"" my jaw dropped and stayed that way for the whole 1:08. Cex is a real guy, and real good at making beats. After all, he IS the number one entertainer! Buy it."
1,What is this Goth/Rock,"Seriously [stinks], the guy sings in this mono -tone voice on every song and each song basically sounds the same slow, kinda like if the Munsters were a rock band, or the adams family. I dont know what this band is trying to do but it isnt working for me. I dont recommend, I still highly recommend Dredg though they ROCK!!!"
1,Too Bad,This CD is a disappointment. I thought the band was ok live. The singer was very stiff but the songs sounded good. I finally got around to buying it... The album sounds terrible and thin. The songs are boring and drone on. Don't waste your money.
2,"A clone of Dope, and a bad one at that","Dope are an original industrial metal band that mixes techno samples, party rythyms, jackhammer beats, and heavy music together and make a raging soundtrack. Dust to Dust is just a clone that uses slower music and one of the worst vocalists I have ever heard. It might not seem like enough to dismiss them, but it is. Making your band into a carbon-copy of another is all to common these days. Don't get this because you might as well just put on Static-X or Dope, who sound just like the guys... except Static and Dope are talented. Don't get this... it's not worth it."
