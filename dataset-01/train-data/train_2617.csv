2,FFFFFFFFFF,"My family has gone through 3 of these in 7 months. Reliable, but only if you don't move it from desktop-to-desktop"
2,Worked for 6 months,"It worked fine. I used this for 6 months, then it stopped working. The LED doesn't light up, so there is no electrical connection. I will try a different brand now."
1,Stop Working after 6 weeks,"I bought this so that I could use my other computer for my homeschool lessons. Set up was fine, connected on the first try. The signal was very weak everytime I used it even though my wireless modem is on the same floor. However, it allowed me to use it for what I needed it for. One day I plugged it in and nothing happened. I tried another USB port and still nothing. I looked online to see how to return it and found out that I had missed my window to return it by 2 weeks. I am really disappointed in this purchase. Now, not only an I out of the money, I can't even return it. I will do more research next time before I purchase another product like this one."
2,Stopped working in 2 months. Not a reliable product.,"Very poorly designed product, it heats up very fast.I used it for about 2 months and then it just stopped working.It did not connect to internet anymore. Since then I have spent many hours trying to get in touch with customer support with no luck. The one year warranty cannot be used as DLink customer service is quite elusive."
1,terrible tech support,"We've been using this product for less than five months, it was working fine while it lasted. Then one day it died, doesn't light up, doesn't do anything. Supposedly it's still under their one-year warranty, we were told that they would send replacement as soon as the tech support deems the product defective. We spent hours on the phone with the tech support! We were told to download and install new drivers, new service packs... while it's obvious that this item simply died! We are supposed to call back again for more ""support options"". But we decide to give up.Fortunately Amazon has a good return policy, we'll still be able to get partial refund. You could bet that our next wireless adaptor will not be D-Link!"
5,Great adapter! Worked immediately on my Ubuntu box without any help!,Great adapter! Worked the first time it was plugged in on my Ubuntu laptop. Solid signal strength every time. Holds the connection well; no drop outs! Much better than the Netgear unit it replaced. I would not hesitate to buy another one.
1,Died after a few months,"It worked pretty well at first. But then I had to keep reinserting it into the USB port to get it to connect to the network. Finally, it just died altogether. What a waste of money."
3,A bit slow,"This wireless adapter seems a bit slow, considering my wireless modem is upstairs, and I'm using this for my desktop which is downstairs. If you're ordinarily surfing the web, this adapter is fine, however if you need reliable strong internet used to play games, I wouldn't recommend this item, as it cuts in and out during gameplay."
3,D-Link,One year ago I purchased a D- Link router and 2 D-Link wireless USB adapters for my children's computers for upstairs. We did not have any problems up to last week. One USB adapter stopped working? If the router is D-link should I buy a D-Link wireless USB adapter or any other wireless USB adapters work?
1,Flimsy,"The product falls apart. Tape held the case together for awhile, then it just stopped working. Don't buy.-Dennis Chandler-Holtz"
1,Mine quit too,"Like Mr. Sjoblom's review says, this device is not strong on longevity. I got mine in March, and it has completely stopped working (tried on multiple computers, various USB ports, the light won't come on and the ports can't identify the device, saying 'This device has malfunctioned').Worked great for a while, but it's toast now. Don't buy it if your computer will stay connected for long periods, it might well burn out."
1,Returned Product,"I had to return this product as it did not work. I was on the phone with D-Link Tech support for over an hour and they could not help me. Ultimately I had to return the product, and I will say, Amazon's return system is AWESOME. I printed the return label, mailed it off, and had my account credited the next week. Meanwhile, I bought another product from Amazon and it works great."
1,Junk,"I'm running Vista 64Bit and Windows 7 64Bit systems. The device was recognized by Windows, but, not by the D-Link installation software. Updating drivers from D-Link did not help. Tech support did not help. Return to sender asap."
3,Not the best choice for Vista PCs,The drivers on the installation CD don't work with Vista but apparently there are some drivers somewhere since it does install OK.You have to use Window's built-in wireless abilities since the d-link monitor program crashes and D-link no longer supports this model. Probably be better to not use the installation CD then you wouldn't have to go in and uninstall the dead program.Once you do that it seems to work OK.
2,Died after 8 months...,"I bought this item in February after seeing the good reviews and cheap price. It worked fine for about 6 months. Had some issue where I had to reconnect to my network after around 6 months. Then just a few days ago it just died. I see from the one star reviews that this isn't an isolated case and it looks like calling the company will require a couple hours of tech support. It's not worth the hassle for $25. I guess I am one of the unlucky ones. I will cut my losses, but will not buy D-Link again."
1,Waste of time and money,"I wish I could give 0 stars on the attributes.I loved the price on this item but in the end, it's become a waste of money.Pro: It was easy to install.Con: It worked for a short period of 3-4 months before it began having trouble staying connected. As time progressed, it held connection less and less till it finally just died.Good luck to any who are brave enough to purchase this item. Hope you have better luck than we did."
2,not so usefull,this adapter is fine to use close to the moderm ... but a soon as u go to another room dont work..
3,Fiddlesticks,Seems like a great toy. Purchased for my granddaughter age 3. Very hard to put the sticks in the holes. Maybe will work when she is older.
3,Pieces are a little brittle,"A few pieces have broken ends already, this was a Christmas present. The boys love playing with it though. Pieces are larger than old version of tinker toys."
5,Fiddlestix,This Fiddlestix Connector set is a very fun building set - encourages building and using your imagination for children and their parents!!!
1,Not a good buy!,Nothing about these is good. No matter what we tried to build it didn't fit or not right parts. Extremely disappointed and would not waste money again and you shouldn't either. Stick with Legos they work!
5,teaching tool,"Recommended by a geometry teacher as an intuitive toy for learning geometric principles. I thought I could use it in photography classes to exponentially increase the visual geometric experience. With one, only one student per class could participate. When I saw these on sale, I went ahead and bought four more so students can work in teams. This brand saved me a bunch of money so I could buy this for my classroom!"
3,Let Down,"I got these for Christmas for my kids, they have a hard time getting the long pieces pushed into the other pieces they fall out. Plus the color tranfers from the Fiddlestix onto their hands, and it will NOT come off completely with soap and water. It says non-toxic on the can, but it also says they are made in China which now has me concerned."
3,Good but dated collection of essary on the Scotch-Irish,"Five essays from a 1965 Ulster Historical Foundation symposium at Belfast's Queens' University addressing aspects of Scotch-Irish immigration to America. Though lacking depth, contributors E.R.R. Green, Maldwyn Jones, E.E. Evans, E. Wright, and A. Link raise important questions and suggest further avenues of inquiry. Jones is perhaps the most important with his emphasis on continuing Protestant migration after the American Revolution."
4,Good...For the price,For the price this is a good foil cutter. It is your typical platic piece with the thin metal edges on each side. I have had many of these type of cutters and usually the thin metal cutting piece breaks. For the price this is a good cutter. I don't think it will last as long as a $20+cutter but if you are not too aggressive like my wife it will open many bottles for a long time. Will update if issues arise.
1,Not very durable...,It works great! I've used it at home a half dozen times with no problem. I gave one to a Bartender friend of mine who loves it too...PeteUPDATE: I just found out that two of the Wine Foil Cutters I gave as gifts broke fairly quickly. I'm going to give the item just one star now. An item that cost that much should last a long long time...Pete
1,Dull,I bought an Oster electric opener last year which I really like but it came with a fairly chinsy wrapper remover which gets dull every few weeks so I thought I would upgrade. This one one is more dull and cheap than the Oster one!What ya get for 8 bucks I guess.Anyone have another option? I could only find this one here.
1,Poor choice,This broke on the third use. I am now purchasing a foil cutter from Amazon that has received consistently good ratings.
3,Satisfied,"This product works the best out of three that I've tried. The style is streamlined and unnoticible under clothing. My only complaint or problem is that the silicone irritates my skin. It would be better to have fabric on the underside where it touches the shoulder. I put tissue or baby powder there when using the cushions. Also, it does alleviate the strain and prevents the straps from digging into my shoulders. I recommend this product."
5,Awesome speakers!!,"I read alot of literature about Bose and all of their different home theater systems. I almost got the Lifestyle V20, but just went the other way at the last second. I wanted a little more options as far as sound settings. Anyway, these speakers sound great! Totally worth the money! The subwoofer (acoustimass) is BOOMING! You hear every detail that comes through your audio. Definately would buy this over any other speaker brand."
3,Good but anticipated better,"Easy enough to set up. Base is good, but overall the system does not ""fill"" the room with sound."
1,Not for non-Evangelicals,"Don't be fooled, this book is not about Napoleon Dynamite. The movie is mentioned only for the occasional quote, and the vast majority of this book is dedicated to biblical references and religious rhetoric. This book may be well-suited for providing material for Sunday School lessons, but don't waste your money if you are simply a fan of the movie."
1,It's held together by glue,"I loved this foot bellows for the first four or five times I used it. Then it fell apart. There is a metal ring going around the top and bottom of the yellow part and it literally is held on with glue which eventually unstuck, making the whole thing useless. I wouldn't buy this one again."
2,Good Poetry?,"I picked up this book because Hastings was trying to get rid of it for 99 cents and the cover made the book sound pretty interesting. Well, let's just say the back cover was much more sophisticated than the actual book, which itself lacked any kind of style or complexity. Rather, it focuses on the wanderings of Mark West and seems to romanticize his pointless life as some kind of deep literary pilgrimage. It is a mockery to anyone out there who takes literature seriously, the only good point coming with Mark's final resolution ""to grow up."" This comes after Howard dies, which I assume is supposed to be sad. Howard's character is never developed enough for the reader to form any kind of attachment. The novel is somewhat boring at times, ludicrous at others, and on the whole would be much better if it actually had a plot. It is real in its description of a human being, but it is no great literary achievement.."
4,"Pretty disappointing next to ""Girl""","I was very excited to be pleasantly surprised by the release of a new Blake Nelson novel. Being a 17 year old girl, I could totally relate to his debut, Girl. Unfortunately, Exile was weak in comparison in terms of plot, impact and character development. By the end of Girl the reader can feel the pain and the hope of Andrea Marr, but at the end of Exile, the reader is left feeling hopelessly unsatisfied and very unaffected. Bottom line: if you have a lot of time on your hands and enjoyed Nelson's first piece, Girl, check this one out. It can't kill you even though it may have you nodding off to sleep a couple of times."
3,"Not bad, not great","I really had no expectations coming into this book. I had not read Girl, and honestly had not even heard of it. Having no pre-conceived notions about the author probably helped me enjoy this novel much more. It is a basic coming of age story with a very abrupt end. Nelson needed to add about 20 pages at the end. The book reminded me, very much, of Nevermind Nirvana by Mark Lindquist. Decent, if unremarkable, coming of age stories about people who should have already come of age."
2,"Not a good as ""Girl""","I read 'Exile' after I read 'girl', and hoped it was be just as good...but it wasn't. 'Exile' didn't hold my attention, and it seemed to drag on. Reading about Mark did help me to realize how I don't want to be when I grow older, so the book gets snaps for that."
3,"interesting, but no depth","the way this book is narrated is kind of annoying, it's written in third person in the present tense, for example it might say ""mark sits down, he is starting to feel the effects of the heroin he just snorted"". This book really isn't very deep either, but it is interesting. i enjoyed reading it even though i got nothing out of it. i wasn't impressed."
3,Disappointing for Nelson,"I thought I would want to read whatever Blake Nelson published, but I was wrong. Girl was by far his best book, but this one was a big letdown. The characters were uninteresting and sometimes repellent, the poems inserted every now and then added nothing to the work (and bored me), and the ""gritty city"" subject matter just didn't interest me.It's possible that the NYC writing scene could really dig this, but I didn't. (And I like Neresian.) Not really worth the time."
1,This book stinks!,"Good photos of Candy, but not worth the cost of the book!That's all you get - ""stick your fingers in your mouth and blow!"". That's as much information as this phamplet gives you - I can't believe Amazon would carry it. I don't know a single thing more about whistling after reading this book than I knew before - and I still can't whistle."
1,doesn't deliver on its promise,"Most of the 24 sparse pages of this little pamphlet is fluff and padding. The little that is devoted to the task of whistling did not help me in the least. As it happens, I already know how to whistle with four fingers (2 hands). The one-hand whistle instructions tell you, essentially, to stick your fingers into your mouth and blow. This did not help me.Whatever merit someone may find in this publication (and, to repeat, I really found none) would be offset by the ridiculous price for a flimsy thing like this. I really feel abused."
4,the beginning at last,"Finally available, this little gem has eluded collectors for years. The original LP on the Philips label was hard to find even back in '75 when import LP's were everywhere and I already had thier 2nd and 3rd albums but number 1 was never around. This 1st album is not like the rest of the catalog which deals mostly with epic space and prog rock. This was a sound of a contemporary hard rockin band keeping up with the rock scene showing their love for Deep Purple, Sabbath and Uriah Heep. Most of the songs are generously long 6 to 8 minutes so they get a little adventurous with arrangements and you hear a little prog in the organ /guitar duels.This album sounds great for being recorded in 1970, sort of like Lucifer's Friend 1st album.A great listen for classic rock lovers, and a great way to get into this band and then get the others and listen to these guys go leaps and bounds between albums."
3,Informative,"This book, which consists of 7 previously published essays, describes aspects of population policy, family planning, and economics in the Middle East, chiefly Jordan and Egypt. Although the back cover claims it presents an argument that rapid population growth in the West Bank and Gaza combined with economic recession in the Gulf States (which reduced opportunities for foreign employment) contributed to the Intifada, this is actually the topic of only one essay. Overall, the essays present some very interesting and useful information, with numerous tables and charts, but there is no attempt at synthesis of the widely varying topics. I found the overview of recent Egyptian history in the sixth chapter, ""Population Pressure and Oil Revenue: Egypt and Saudi Arabia-1962-85"" particularly insightful."
5,Safety Cones,I ordered these for my Grandson. They are very sturdy and durable. I have to say he really like them.
2,Do not buy if your device requires more than a 50 watt output.,"I was using this to run a small mini fridge with a wattage requirement of 65. Unfortunately I went through all 3 fuses in a matter of minutes. Maybe somebody else knows an easy fix for this problem, but my recommendation is to fork over the extra cash for a better converter."
2,Fuse burns when connected,"We purchased the transformer model VC500W for connecting the 400Watt 220Volts blender. Transformer is working fine when the blender is in unload condition. But when the blender load is on, transformer fuse is burning down."
5,I love it!,Before moving to Europe I bought 2 of these voltage transformers to be able to use my small applainces and electrical devices including my Bose companion 5 speaker set. This transformer has a VC max power of 500W but the other has a VC max power of 1000W and they are both high quality products.I would recommanded this product!
4,Works Great Second Time Around,"The first product was delivered damaged beyond use. But Amazon collected it and replaced it very quickly with a perfectly functioning replacement, which has been working great ever since. This one is the model to get because you can leave it plugged in 24-7. We use it to power our European VCR and sound system with no problems. Lighter duty, occasional use versions burnt out quickly, but this one is doing great after more than half a year. Very happy."
4,a product worth the money you paid,"product quality is ok, not bad. with its cheap price. I am still using now and nothing wrong with it. shippement time is ok also."
3,"works, but gets *very* hot","I'm running set of 220W Fluorescent Lights which run off a 220v ballast, and they stay on for 6-8 hours/day. The transformers does work, but gets so hot I'm afraid to put anything next to it. Can't touch it for more than 2-secs. Given how hot it gets, I hope it lasts..."
4,Easy to use and stable,I have a PS3 bought in Singapore that does not have a universal power supply. So I wanted a 240v to 110v step down transformer to use it here in US.This transformer is very easy to use. It can be used as a step up or a step down transformed which makes it very useful. I am using it successfully to run my 240v PS3 regularly. So far it has worked great.
1,Burnt my subwoofer,"I used this to run a 260W subwoofer from 220V->110V (changed the pins accordingly in the back). It worked fine for one night; and then next morning, the subwoofer was dead (wouldn't work neither with this unit nor with others).My verdict: piece of garbage."
3,horsse movie,this movie was a bit slow and i would of liked to see more of the back story to this movie
5,You Will Love This Saint and His Story,"This is a wonderful story of St Giuseppe Moscati! I promise you, you will fall in love with this saint and will be happy you saw this movie! Although it does not tell about all the spiritual things this saint did, it does show in a touching way the ""Saint in the man"" and you will be moved by him and his life. The film is in Italian, but my children (9 & 10)watched the movie without reading the subtitle as it is so intriguing and draws you in! It has become one of our favorite movies and he is one of our favorite saints!"
4,Healer of the Poor,"A well-made, well acted drama about the ministry of this remarkable 20th century doctor who devoted his adult life to caring for the poor in Naples, Italy. This made-for-TV Italian film portrays very vividly Moscati giving free medical care and even giving his own money to his patients for additional medication and/or food. Not shown in the film is that he was known during his 25-year medical career not only to pray often & fervently for the healing of his patients but also for the strength and faith to find ways to help those with severe medical problems.Moscati's fondness for the princess Elena (played by the lovely Casia Smutniak) makes for an entertaining subplot, but is fictitious. All in all I found this film to be inspiring biopic about this selfless humanist."
4,A tribute to compassion,"This film is about the difference one heart of compassion can make in the lives of many. Dr. Giuseppe Moscati lived to serve, and his commitment to care for those in need earned him a special place in the hearts of both patients and the people he worked with. I definitely recommend this as a family film!"
1,Waste of money,"I have several raw books and I only eat raw. This book was a real waste of money. The recipes were so simple (and many were untasty) that they were rediculous. For example: ""Instant Veggie Soup"" consisted of 2 c. tomatoes, 2/3 c. pineapple, 2 c. spinach and 3 stalks of celery. Mix and eat. Anyone can throw a bunch of fruits and vegetables together, but in raw cooking you need to make sure they taste good together. My favorite ""fast food"" raw book is ""Raw Foods for Busy People"" by Jordan Maerin. The recipes are simple AND delicious!"
1,Not the Best,"This book was a disappointment. Yes, the recipes are simple, but they're pretty bland. Many of them use the same or similar ingredients, so a lot of the dishes taste the same; there isn't much variety. The most interesting recipes in this book came from other chefs, and even they weren't very good. Of all the recipes, I use only three: Roquette Me Soup, Avocado Mayo, and Submarine Rolls (which I modified and, I think, improved). I would not recommend this book for someone who's just starting on raw foods. Instead, try ""The Raw Food Detox Diet,"" with ""Raw Foods for Busy People"" as a complement."
2,Too Hard,Ok I made a person now what? I read the manual and that made it more complicated. It takes an hour to finish building a walkway. You need to be VERY paitent to play this game. I bought it and it was horrible.I hated it! So PLEASE listen and save your money! I can think of at least 20 other things to buy with the money I paid for it.
5,sinting surinting,"ini buku yang wajib dimiliki, sinting surinting aja kalau nggak punya. Forget everything else."
4,Akira awakens...,"Akira, the title character, is central to this volume. Initially, he appears to be an asset that everyone wants, but the long-hinted at power of Akira is slowly awakened as the story progresses.The awakening of Akira changes the whole nature of the story. Both in the content and in the illustrations, you can see that a very large change has come to the world, and that things won't be the same again.And speaking of the illustrations: the sheer scope of the story is well captivated by Katsuhiro Otomo's art. Quite, quite spectacular.At the end of this volume, we are halfway through the six volumes of this epic story. From my uncertain beginnings, I'm now sure I'll be following this through to the end."
4,The Catastrophic Chapter of Akira Series,"With Akira finally freed from his cryonic sleep, all the forces that are interested in him start their wars against each other. SO many characters, yet so exciting as the story moves kinetically through chases and battles around Neo Tokyo. It keeps me over the edge as a fast-paced action movie with a foreboding sense that something big is about to happen.And it does, when Akira's dormant telekinesis power is unleashed, it's nothing short of massive bewilderment. Think of the power of 1000 atomic bombs hidden inside the body of a boy, exploding at the same time. The destructions scenes are so detailed, I couldn't help wondering how long it took Mr. Otomo to draw these pages.Just sheer wonder."
4,Still very good,"They throw a lot of new characters at you in this one, and it can be hard to keep up. But hang in there and read it twice if you have to. I can't wait until I can get the next one, because the ending if (almost literally!) da bomb."
5,great to have,"This book is very helpful, i love the outlines and it has sooo many question that can help u out. its a must have to review!"
3,For display only,"This is a great looking blade. The detail is fine and it certainly looks real enough. The blade itself is about as sharp as a bowling ball. Not made from weapons-grade steel, either. I would be doubtful if you could kill a hamster with this. Just leave it on the shelf."
1,Didnt Work...,"I purchased ""A Family for Joe"" for my grandmother and received it promptly. Well, this dvd does not work at all..."
4,Nice wholesome movie,"A Family For Joe stars Robert Mitchum in a role he usually wasn't cast in: a man caring for young ones. This movie depicts a family of children fighting to stay together. Robert Mitchum steps up to fill the role, reluctantly at first. Nice movie."
1,Bad disc,The video get distorted and freezes but the audio is still playing. I tried it in three different DVD players and freezes in the same spot every time. Rest of disc is unreadable. The show it's self is a great story.
3,Title is misleading,The title says you can Sit Down & Shape UP. I have back and leg problems I thought this was the video for me but a large amount of it is done standing.
5,A great movie,"This movie is awesome, albeit cheesy. If you like cult classics and mystical stuff, you will enjoy this animated classic. I loved it when it came on tv and though it is geared toward the pre teen audience I still enjoy reliving my childhood. It is definitly a rare gem."
5,Favorite,"I bought this for my 3 year old last year and it still looks like new, and it has been step on, left in the yard, smashed under the van seat and I can not believe it's still in one piece and my son loves that it is soft and he can sleep with it, something he can't do with the hard plastic action figures."
2,Impact books are usually bad for the most part,Peter David is a good writer but when it comes to giving instructions like in this book he falls short. Too much technical stuff and no magic which makes PAD intersting in the first place. Your better off reading his blog then buying this book :)
2,Where Is The New Stuff?,"I couldn't wait for it--and now I am still waiting. I have been playinig UO since the beginning. I love UO. However, I shelled out my bucks, and after exploring for a whole night I foundabsolutely nothing new.I've already been playing with the 3D client. The music ispartly recycled from Ultima Ascension (that's fine with me, Ilove that soundtrack). I've been to Ilshenar many times.And will there be anything for players that don't play in packsbecause they only can play a few hours a week?"
2,UO is dead,Im sorry but UO is a dead game.LBR shows it is.UO is like stuck in the very old role-playing games. The graphics are awful and the monsters are have BAD AL.This game is fun for about 3 months. Allso there are skill caps so if you go over you cant gain skills or exp anymore.
1,Ultima online isnt all that any more,"Well I have played over 3 years now. If you are first starting out dont expect to find a house with out paying tons of cash. yea I mean cash.. A normal house on ebay goes for 50.00 buck. A large house is way to high. I have seen large towers, castle go for over 1000.00 dollars..that real cash. Orgin is in process of make some radical change to the skills now. Most of the people are about to quit the game. They introduce LBR but dint tell everyone how they were going to kill some of the best skills. On top of that they say they are going to make new monster...never happen so far this is the biggest let down for online games."
1,Big disappointment DONT BUY IT!!,"THERE IS A... MONTHLY FEEThis is a piece of [garbage]!! First off, your character moves like a bucket of concrete. The control is sluggish in 3D and 2D modes and don't even think about getting through your first challenge-getting out of the first 2 cubic inches of the... screen. THE MONTHLY FEE IS A DIRTY TRICK. The box has in small font: cannot be played offline, monthly fee subject to raising... OH YA I only gave this a 1 star becuse there is no 0 stars..."
5,"Strong, secure","These are the perfect size for shipping baby and toddler clothes, cloth diapers, bras, and small plush toys. I use these almost daily shipping things, and I've never had a problem with any coming open or ripping. The poly mailers are very tough to rip, and the flaps are very strong."
1,Terrible,"I have been using poly mailers for some time now, these are the worst! Transparant allowing product to be seen through the mailer, not what my customers will like at all!! Bad adhesive, can pull open easily. I would not reccommend this item and seller, seek a different supplier."
4,Cheap but works,I double package my embroidered shirt prior to mailing. This is great for that. the mailers are very thin and the the tape portion is odd compared to the company I used before. But over all great fro what I use them for. I did have to throw out a few that were damaged by glues to each other during transit to me.
5,great mailers!,I ship stuff often and these mailers are great! I would definitely recommend them as long as you use bubble wrap for breakable items.
3,good for sending small things,"I bought the wrong size! this is a long rectangle size...not sure what it necessarily is good for, but either way i like these mailers a lot! they are very light and great for sending clothing and non fragile items."
2,Poly Bags,Poly Bags are of poor quality. Bags rip when you pull the white protector off to seal them.
5,Perfect packaging solution to keep shipping costs low,"I'm an eBay seller and purchased these bags as a way of reducing my costs. Before poly mailers, I was paying $0.50 to $1 each for small boxes or padded envelopes. In addition, those packing materials were increasing my shipping costs.With these poly mailers, I can ship just about everything I sell via USPS First Class Mail (for items up to 13 oz), which is much cheaper than Priority (for reference, a 4x4x4 cardboard box weighs about 6 oz empty). I have now purchased two of these sets of bags that I use to ship just about anything. They're durable and seal well without the need for added tape, which you need to seal padded envelopes tightly.The are large enough to hold dresses, tops, small items wrapped in bubble wraps, flip flops, and more. Plus, they come packaged in a larger outer bag that's great for storage. A great product!"
1,Horribly packaged!,The poly mailers were jammed & crumpled into their packaging. This caused the mailer's sealing strips to become uncovered causing the mailers to stick to each other. Most are damaged & unusable!I'm sure the poly mailers would have been great if they had not arrived damaged. The other items in the package were absolutely fine so that means these were packaged damaged!
5,Great deal!,These envelopes are perfect for mailing small clothing items. They are very lightweight so they help reduce shipping costs. I do a lot of selling on Ebay and these work very well for children's clothing/shoes. They are probably too small for adult clothing.
5,great shipping bag,"great shipping bag very strong and at a great price, will buy again and highly recommend to all who are looking for a sturdy shipping envelope"
5,everything I need for small packages,These were strong enough for my small packages.Easy to pack & ship. I like the material and it closes so easily & securely.
4,A little thin but does the job!,I use these to ship my merchandise and although they can be a bit thin and seem like they might rip they do the job well. I have yet to have a package damaged.
4,rocket it to the white house,"okay, i'll cut to the chase if you liked electrelane's rocket it to the moon chances are you will like i want to be the president. the three songs on this release are more upbeat here then rocket and will either a.) have you dancing or b.) tapping to the beat...or both"
2,Prefer the original ABBA,"I love the Abba CD - use it to ""rebound"" by so I thought this ""version"" would give me a bit different workout. I was disappointed - seemed like someone decided to re-record the original at a much faster speed. This CD was just annoying!! I will stick w/ the original Abba and leave this for the trash."
3,"another entry for the same, and not entirely convincing disc","Oftentimes the same disc will appear under two or more different entries. I refer you to my not very favorable review of this one:Carl Ruggles, Ernest Bloch, Paul Reale, Larry Lipkis: Piano Sonatas and other works. In capsule, here are better recordings of Bloch's magnificent sonata, and the compositions of Paul Reale I find rather disappointing."
5,I love this book,"I picked up this book because I was intrigued by the title and cover. Once I started reading, I could not put it down. The author grabs your attention from the start and won't let go. There are some pretty graphic parts about Jessica, the main character being raped by her uncle and getting revenge, but it did not distract from the story one bit. I felt Jessica's pain and cried with her. Very few books have ever moved me to tears."
4,Gorgeous work but you won't be able to learn it from this,"I LOVE Moyer's work, unfortunately the mini lessons provided in the book, while useful, will not lead to a rendering of images anywhere close to those you'll drool over in this book.I enjoy just looking at her work and aspiring to paint in this style, but this book is not in-depth enough or step-by-step enough to get you to this level of work."
2,Needed details in instruction,"It is very important to me as a serious artist to be able to understand thru detail of how am image is painted. Why buy and spend the money for a book unless it is completely useful. I can look at pictures all day and try to figure out how to paint it but if I buy a book to show me, I expect to learn a lot."
5,Fun & functional,"When I moved out and started my own home, my mom got me a set of Gone Fishin' for my dinnerware. I love things that are fun and unexpected (my kitchen is filled with Alessi and Koziol, so that should tell you how much I like something different!). This set is very fun yet elegant. I know that sounds weird, but it's true.The quality is superb. They're quite heavy. It definitely warrants the price tag. I use these utensils daily and they still look like new. I always hand-wash them. When I first saw photos of them, I was a bit worried about the spoon in particular. It looked like I was going to nip my lip a lot, but I never have once. I haven't found the edges to be sharp at all.I've used the utensils at everything from a fancy dinner party to my 3-year-old nephew's birthday party. They're a conversation piece with all crowds and I am never embarrassed to use them. I'm quite proud that they're in my home.I highly recommend this set. Everyone needs some whimsy, right?"
3,Better for todlers and pre-school than <1yr olds.,"My wife has some limitations on imagining what to do all day with our 9mos old so I thoguth I'd see if there was anything out there that woudl help. I bought the book knowing that it covered a wide range of ages, but was expecting abit more on the pre-walking stages of a childs life. There were a few things, but most of the good suggestions and activities were for toddlers and pre-shoolers."
3,Somewhat skimpy,"This is a collection of some of Ray Stevens' novelty hits, but by no means complete. It contains some huge hits like The Streak from 1974 and Bridget the Midget from 1971, plus much older tracks from the 1960s like Gitarzan and Ahab the Arab. Fact is, he recorded plenty more comedy tracks that are available on the album20 Comedy Hits Special Collection. Great compilations of his beautiful ballads, straight pop and novelty songs includeRay Stevens - All-Time Greatest HitsandMisty: The Very Best of Ray Stevens."
4,Ray Stevens - Greatest Comic Hits,I enjoyed this CD very much. Ray is a very funny fellow.I have also seen and enjoyed his video of the same name.
1,Ray Stevens:His All-time Greatest Comic Hits,"I ordered this item back early in March and have yet to receive it. Normally, when I order from Amazon, I have been immensely happy with the product and how quickly I have received it. This item, however, has been at the opposite end of the spectrum. I ordered it, paid for it, but have yet to receive it something like a month later."
4,Historically Important,"Video clips of Wilson over much of his career. You'll enjoy seeing him move and speak if you're a Wilson fan (I am). If you're not, don't bother. The video quality is not first class, but practically every frame has Robert Anton Wilson in it. What more could you want? Someday, anthropologists will look at this and know we weren't just a bunch of neanderthal Republicans."
4,A Visit With Uncle Bob...,"If you've never encountered Robert Anton Wilson, skip this DVD and buy yourself a copy of Illuminatus! (fiction, writen with Robert Shea) or Quantum Psychology (non-fiction).If you're already a fan of Wilson's work, you're unlikely to learn anything new here; but you'll probably enjoy yourself all the same. If, like me, you never got the chance to met Wilson in person, this is probably as close as we'll get to sitting down for a chat with elderly ""Uncle Bob"". There's also a random assortment of material of varying quality from earlier in his life.My recommendation in brief: read some of his books first, then leave this video playing on your TV as you go about your daily chores and let Uncle Bob worm his way into your brain."
4,Warmth and comfort,Purchased these socks for a friend of mine who loves them. They keep his feet warm and are very comfortable.
5,Great Gift,"Bought as a Xmas gift for my brother, recovering from torn calf muscle surgery and an avid skier. He loves them."
2,What is renforced?,"The word ""can't"" is renforced over and over. When I read this book to my dsughters I changed the wording ""the bus can go when the bridge is down. I don't want my daughters using the word ""Can't""."
5,Hope for our future.,"My 'phenom' daughter recommended this book to me. She read it as a poli-sci/pre-med undergrad at UC Berkeley, and having noticed my growing cynicism regarding the direction our country has been headed, this was her 'philosophical lifesaver'. What Prof. Rawls offers is nothing less than a roadmap of hope, not only for our country but for the world. And that's a mouthful of praise, coming from a cynical Vietnam-vet."
2,Very basic vocabulary,"I bought this book to study for the GRE based on good reviews listed here, but I have to say I'm very disappointed. Just from skimming through the text book I've found that I already know at least two thirds of the words listed. I'm amazed that they included such simple words like: mode, consolidate, ethics, and access. The words are not sorted by difficulty, but alphabetically so it's not very useful for me to study from. Maybe if your vocabulary isn't so great and you are taking the SAT this book might be useful for you.I would recommend Kaplan's Word Power Third Edition instead and skip to the 2nd section. You'll learn much more from this book."
2,Not Helpful for GRE as Promised,"I bought the Word Smart II paperback to help me with GRE words. But, the ""GRE Hit Parade"" in the back of the book falls short of expectations. Most of the book contains vocabulary words each with a brief definition and a couple of sentences showing uses. But, many words on the GRE Hit Parade are not expanded upon. The GRE Hit Parade itself is merely a terse listing of definitions. Therefore, those studying for the GRE are much better off with a GRE review book rather than purchasing this one.The one good thing about the GRE Hit Parade was the advice to build 10 words a day. I used this technique and found it helpful. But more detailed explanations of these words with example sentences was needed.The publisher, The Princeton Review, has another book out: ""Cracking the GRE"" which also has a GRE Hit Parade. It is a slightly more concise listing, but it is about as useful. Vocabulary lists are only supplementary to regularly learning vocabulary words from readings anyway."
2,good for cramming,"I hate memorizing lists of words and their respective definitions. Even though they have one or two sentences to show you how they are used. My favorite method is to read them in context. This will probably only be done by reading copiously. Reading the Princeton word (Junior) was fantastic. I wish they could make one like that, but at a higher level. The Junior book had great cute stories and the most amount of new word learning anyone can have from reading so little."
5,Suits Me...,"I think the title of the CD is a little misleading but the songs suit me. Songs like Debby Boone's ""You Light Up My Life"" didn't become huge hits because nobody liked them! Infact, that song is the reason I bought the CD. I admit it, I love the song!"
2,Not what I expected,"Very limited selection of music. Not at all what I wanted or needed. There was nothing to tell what songs were on it, so I bought it without knowing. THAT was MY mistake!"
4,answered almost all of my questions,"This book is awesome. If you're interested in a school, but still don't quite have a feel for what it's really like, all of the College Prowler books are perfect. It has information on all aspects of campus, from the quality of academics, to night life, to dorm rooms. The best parts are where they list specific things, such as which dorm rooms are the best and where the best places to eat are. The only thing is that they pretty much ignore the specific departments. This just gives you a feel for what it would be like to go there."
3,Ok Movie,"I love Reese Witherspoon, but Just Like Heaven just wasn't as good as I expected. The story was good, but I didn't really see the magic between Reese and Mark Ruffalo, and that is why this movie did not work for me. Maybe it was the wrong actor to cast in this role. I don't know.This movie is an OK rental, but I can't recommend buying it."
2,I was disappointed,I had read this book and listened to the audio of it and loved them both. The people who made this movie thought they could improve the story the author had written. They couldn't and didn't. Original story was much better than the movie story. Sad--we were very disappointed..
4,"a good movie, not a good adaptation","I saw this in the theaters when it came out, and I was deceived, since I had been told it was a direct adaptation from Marc Lévy's novel ""If Only It Were True."" Definitely NOT an adaptation, but rather, the movie is anything but loosely based on the novel in the question, since many characters in the book differed from the movie (the mother is in the book, there is no sister; her dog, not her niece, ""sees"" Elizabeth; etc.), or they were added (the guy from the psychic/occult bookstore).However, this is my second viewing of the film. I have put aside the fact that this is a film based on a book. And I actually enjoyed this comedy, a lot. So put the book's notes and story aside; watch the film for what it is: a good comedy, with lots of laughs and cute moments.Warning: Definitely a chick film!"
3,HEAVEN can Wait for Video!,"After a slow start, JUST LIKE HEAVEN finds its place and enjoys a Heavenly finish. A couple moments don't quite play out with the ""ghost"" rules! I would think it would be hard to ride in a car, when you slide right through the door. And it seems even more difficult to lie on a bed when you can walk right through a table. But the point of the movie is to have fun and leave reality at the door, so sit back, and have a spirited good time."
2,Its leads almost keep it afloat,I'm a die hard Reese Witherspoon fan. I think that her charming likablity always goes a long ways in all of her film. And so far she has proved she really is a true actress like her as June Cash or Tracy Flick in Election. So I forced myself to see Just Like Heaven. And don't get me wrong Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo are fun to watch the falls short with romantic comedy cliche's that here defined in Sweet Home Alamaba. Some scene's just didn't seem to flow as well. Like when they first meet in her apartment. Over all I like to see Romantic Comedies that have witty dialoge. I usually know where its going but its the fun in getting there. Just Like Heaven doesn't really have the spark to keep it going.
5,Another hit for Ms. Witherspoon!,"If you like Reese Witherspoon, you will adore this movie. She gives yet another wonderful performance in this light-hearted romantic comedy. Mark delivers a suprisingly good performance as well. I liked him in 13 Going on 30, but he shines in this movie.Great movie!"
4,Refreshing and Entertaining!,"I really liked this movie. It is funny, entertaining and somewhat spiritual. yes, there are no major twists here and the storyline is fairly straightforward, but nevertheless it should keep you entertained. Overall: VERY GOOD!"
3,Just Like Heaven (Full Screen),"Just Like Heaven (Widescreen Edition)One of the best comedy, romance, fantasy movies I've seen lately. Something in it for everyone. Once you start watching, you can't stop. Highly recommend!"
4,Ghost type,I enjoy watching these ghost type movies. This is one of my fav witherspoon movies. I really enjoyed the movie.
5,Love it,"Just Like Heaven is an awesome movie! I think the characters were played well, and I love the romance, love connection building between the two main characters. I got a big kick out of the part of the guy's best friend. A true friend for sure. It is amazing what people are willing to do for love. Lots of laughs, and good feeling for the heart. Great movie for a night with your wife or girl friend to enjoy a movie and laugh together."
4,Just Like Heaven movie,"We loved this movie when it came out on TV! I had some credits left over so I decided to purchase our own DVD so that we could watch it later. The two actors were perfect for this part and the movie kept us entertained until the end. In fact, you need to watch it till the end!!"
4,Just Like Heaven,"The kind of movie that makes you feel good. You laugh, you cry, you laugh some more. Excellent movie to get away from it all (for just a little while)."
5,Fun and easy watch,"This is one of those movies that doesn't expect its viewers to take it too seriously. The actors clearly have fun making it, and that's all they want out of their viewers."
4,Wonderful and Entertaining!!,"Great performance by both Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo! Good chemistry! Finely tuned movie! All of the characters did a wonderful job in the movie!I did not expect much when I loaned it from the library but then I really enjoy it and even bought a DVD. My sister likes it too and asked for my copy to keep. I am thinking about buying one for myself.I read the book (If Only It Were True) afterwards because I like the movie so much! Usually the original story is better than the adaptation. However, I am quite disappointed by the book even though it was one of the New York Times best sellers. The movie has a few more characters and is way more interesting and funny. Enjoy!"
4,STOP MESSING UP THE MUSIC!!,"Hello, good movie for what it is. The two leads are wonderful in this film, and John Heder from yes, Napoleon Dynamite!, is really great in his small role. My beef is why in the HELL is hollywood (it deserves a small ""h"") having nobodys redoing popular songs for the movies?? It makes me ill when I hear it. I thought, perhaps they are trying to save money by not paying the artists for the tunes, they can just pay some unkown band to sing the song for $25. For example, when the Cure's superb song ""Just Like Heaven"" came on, with some lady singing it, I was cringing. But then, at the end of the movie, the song comes on again, and it is the CURE that are singing it!! Thereby canceling out my theory. SO, to reiterate, STOP SCREWING UP THE MUSIC!!!!"
3,it's ok.,"Wastn't crazy about this movie....but it's certainly ok. NOt sure what else to say...it was fine, that's all. Buy it only if the price is very good!"
3,Pretty Good,"This is the perfect ""chick flick"" as they call them. You have to suspend all reason to follow the movie, but the movie is kind to the heart. Ruffalo and Witherspoon work well together. It's a bit of a formula picture, but a good one to take your honey to."
4,Chick Flick with a Twist!,"When I started watching ""Just Like Heaven"" I wasn't aware of the plot - I figured it was a typical ""chick flick"" type movie: girl has a career but no guy, girl finds guy, girl and guy have conflict, girl and guy end-up together - which is why I was surprised when Elizabeth (Reese Witherspoon) ends-up a spirit! I wondered, ""How is this going to work out...?"" However, soon after that the movie became predictable. Nonetheless, this didn't make it any less fun or entertaining. And Reese Witherspoon was *adorable*! Highly recommended!"
4,entertaining fun,Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this romantic chick flick. Suspend some belief for a less than airtight story and just enjoy. I particularly liked Ruffalo's performance against RW and thought he could hold his own. Check it out and enjoy fun entertainment!
4,a great valentine's day movie,"This is one of the best date movies to come out in a while. Reese Witherspoon is great, and Mark Ruffalo is as lovable a romantic lead as there is. A lot of other folks have commented on the acting, directing, and script, I just want to call attention to the mood...we didn't want the movie to end because of the way it made us feel. The movie builds a vibe that lingers pleasantly well after the credits roll.It's a buy."
3,Good Enough,"Although Reese Witherspoon's performance is just as magical as usual, Mark Ruffalo is completely annoying as usual. There's something about his voice and the inflection he gives that really puts a downer on his performances. He upstages whoever he is on screen with by his annoying voice."
2,very average,"i just watched this Film over the weekend&while I enjoyed the sentiment,i felt that it tried a bit too much&couldn't make up it's mind if it wanted to be serious or Funny at times.this film reminded me of quite a few films with a similar theme over the years.Reese Witherspoon&Mark Ruffalo had chemistry,but this film didn't really move me like it should have."
2,"Typical romantic comedy (i.e. ""chick flick"") [2.5 stars]","Lots of ladies will love this movie, most fellas won't. Guys will lose interest -- maybe even leave the room in disgust -- as soon as they see mark Ruffalo's character crying. Ladies will get out the tissue box.Ruffalo and Witherspoon are, indeed, charming. It's nice to see them fall in love, but this type of movie has just been done hundreds and hundreds of times. It's entertaining in the way eating a jelly donut is a good dining experience; enjoyable but absolutely no substance, whatsoever.For what it is it's fine. Gentleman: take my advice and skip this one unless your girlfriend/wife lets you have a couple of guilt-free fishing or golf weekends."
5,Does it get any sweeter?,Has all the right actors and full of what a romantic comedy should be! I have watched it many times since I purchased it. Once I watched it with my husband I just had to take it to my friends and watch it with them!
4,Just Like Heaven,"David Abbott has lost everything - his job, his home, and most importantly his wife. He has just been simply existing and drinking excessively to help cover the pain. David has been looking for a furnished home in San Francisco to rent, and quite by accident stumbles upon the perfect temporary solution. He is happy with his choice, and the prospect of moving in until he sees a woman who is insisting she is the owner. David wants her gone, but she makes it clear that she isn't going anywhere until she figures out what is going on. Together they try to put the pieces together, and discover that she is Elizabeth Masterson. Unfortunately they also discover that Dr. Masterson was in a horrific auto accident. As they seek answers, they also become closer and closer.This is a terrific predictable romantic movie. Reece Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo are wonderful together. They give such a great performance!"
5,Much Better than I Expected,"I didn't like the previews for this one: They made it look like a ghost story. It is much more than that.The problem with the previews was that they couldn't show you what the film ultimately was about without spoiling. I won't tell you either except to say that the film takes a turn at one point and changes direction. It becomes as good of a romantic comedy as has ever been made.The story is about a widower (Mark Ruffalo) who seems to be haunted by the ghost of a prior tenant, a workaholic hospital intern played by Reese Witherspoon. But when we find out what is really going, it changes to heart-wrenching high drama."
4,I really enjoyed this film.,I tend to go for drama but am often surprised with some com/rom films. This is one good surprise.Good chemistry between Witherspoon and Ruffalo.Reese has become one of the best all around actresses out there.I am slowly falling in love with her. In her private life she seems to be well grounded and is not a 'hollywood' roustabout.A guy/girl flick.....about losing someone...then finding someone and ...I believe you will enjoy this one. Guys might not admit it but they will probably enjoy it as well...especially 'honest' guys.
4,No surprise by Ms Witherspoon!!,"This was a very enjoyable movie. Good plot, good acting and a valuble meaning. i saw the movie in the cinema all alone and it still made me laugh and cry. It was a bit short though! Witherspoon and Ruffalo made something great. If you're into romantic comedies this is a good one. Good luck;)"
2,wishing I was in the coma,"short and sweet version: girl gets promotion, girl gets into accident, girl becomes ghost(even though she isnt dead), guy moves into her apartment, then there is about an hour and a half where they are trying to figure out who they REALLY are, then girl wakes up, guy and girl fall in love, and the villagers rejoice. if you were to look up chick flick in the dictionary, you would find a picture of this movie. the only way i would watch this movie is if my girlfriend jammed it down my throat...which unfortunatly is exactly what happened."
1,Try ripping off a good movie,"Pathetic ripoff of Ghost. Total formula. You find yourself thinkingabout the suits in the pitch meeting and why they thought this wouldwork. It's really too bad because Mark Waters is a decent director whomust must have done this for a paycheck. Star vehicle targeted to theSaturday night lonely hearts club, nothing more. I often think thatOscar consideration should take into account other films completed inthe same year they win. If this was the case Reece Witherspoon would beforced to give back her Walk the Line Oscar. This was yet anothershinning example of miscasting Mark Ruffalo. All involved should beashamed. Moreover those giving positive reviews to this film on thissite need to take a good look in the mirror and ask themselves whethersuicide is the answer."
5,An Awesome Movie,"This has to be the best romantic comedies i've ever seen. it's funny, sad, happy and everything. It has a good cast ensambel. I just love this film probably one of resse witherspoons best movie since Legally Blonde."
4,"Cute flick that reminds of ""Ghost""","I was reminded of ""Ghost"" more than once throughout the movie. Not 100% so, but I won't say more so as to not spoil the movie for anyone. It's by all means a romantic comedy. As such, it works. The only thing I'd change in it is the music in the end... Other than that, it's a great rental!"
4,Just Like Heaven,"Elizabeth (Reese Witherspoon) is a busy doctor. She doesn't have time to socialize with anyone, have a friend circle or a boyfriend. One day her life changes and she meets a guy. The only thing is, the guy is the only person who can see her because Elizabeth has apparently died.Pros of the movie - Good acting, nice script, chemistry between actorsCons of the movie - Abrubt ending, movie could have been longer - was only an hour and a halfThis movie was a nice romantic comedy."
3,Smart & Entertaining,"Fresh and entertaining comedy that's not what I expected, it's better. I recommend it."
3,I liked older COB,"I think this new COB album isn't that great. They're starting to conform to ""New Metal."" They're starting to loose their classical style as well as the sick guitar solos. I just hope the album has some better songs than this one. But don't get me wrong, I still think Children of Bodom is one of the greatest metal bands!"
2,The instructions were torn and smeared with some type of grease...,The instructions were torn and smeared with some type of grease leaving it in an unreadable mess. This lack of assistance caused me an entire section of my day to be wasted coasted me unwanted labor charges paid out to my crew... Very disappointed!
5,always keeps ya going and wanting more,I've always loved dark shadows... I remember running home from school to watch it and seeing the first vampire that I fell in love with.....
2,Worn music,"The Infamous Stringdusters have great instrumental musicianship but they have little to offer that hasn't been done before. I find the long drawn out vocals particularly cliché and a bit heavy handed. I guess I just expected this young group to be younger and have something new to say, of which they really don't. If you want Blue Highway then just buy their music."
4,Difficult - good and bad at once,"This is a difficult book to review because it was both boring - at times you want to hop out and push start the storyline - and good. S.L. Viehl creates such an interesting world you are intrigued to see where it is going, you just wish it would go faster.Set in the StarDoc universe but with different characters etc it certainly investigates some interesting cultural conflicts etcI wouldn't say not buy it, but probably better suited to the more science fiction reader than the fantasy."
5,Love Lynn Viehl - Roc & Stardoc series,"I won't review the book for you -- just get it and plunge right in. I love to read Viehl's Stardoc series and now Roc series. All the characters are so human, and those who are sarcastic are great. Now I have to start on some more of her series, though I don't believe she can get better than the books I've read so far. Can't wait for a new Stardoc, and just ordered the last Roc book, which somehow slipped by me. Thanks Amazon for publishing these lists and keeping me on my toes and THANKS Lynn for writing these books."
2,S. L. Viehl could do a lot better,"Just finished this book, but it was a struggle to do so. Very boring in parts, confusing in a lot of others. Supposedly about an ocean race who go on medical evacuations of lost or wounded space ships. Hardly any ""medical"" however, and Dair seems very wishy-washy in many situations with pursuing males of two species.This is the type of ""romance"" where the strong, agressive males overpower the females, who finally ""swoon"" at their advances.Not up to her usual - plus, too much emphasis on religion and last minute miraculous saves of various characters. Not recommended."
5,Why in French?,"I first saw this trilogy in Brazil around 1992. It was in German with Portuguese Subtitle. I am so fascinated with these movies. The story, the actress... everything. Since then I've been looking for the whole trilogy on DVD. When I've found it... it's in French? Come on, let's make this Trilogy Box Set in its original German Language with English, Spanish, Portuguese and all languages Subtitles. Hurry up! The world is waiting. These movies must be seen by the whole Planet. It's a Classic and one of my favorites since I first saw them."
3,What about the original German version?,This is a beautiful set of films that should be available in the original German. I would only buy it in German. Romy made many wonderful films in French but this one should be seen in the original format.
5,Unaccurate But Beautiful,"This movies are certainly a jewel. Thery were filmed around 1955 under the direction of Ernst Marischka and present the story of the Austrian Princess Sissi, delightfully played by an incredibly young and talented Romy Schneider and her marriage to the Kaiser Franz Joseph (Karlheinz Böhm). The story is a fairy tale there's no doubt about it, but it certainly worth watching again and again so if you have the chance to have this set in your hands you shouldn't miss it."
2,Not the Best Grinder I Have Used,"I had a Williams Bounds nutmeg grinder that lasted 10 years, until dropped on the floor. I ordered this instead because there were some things that I did not like about the William Bounds grinder. I regret the change. I have had this grinder for about a year and wish I had the Williams Bounds back. This unit had all of the problems of the WB, plus (1) it is harder to load, (2) the nutmeg gets sliced (this is really a slicer rather than a grinder) so smooth that it will not produce ground nutmeg after the nut is down to about 1/2 of its original size, and (3) unlike the WB, which is real metal, this grinder has a bottom section that is chrome-plated plastic."
5,Love this Grinder,"Absolutely love this grinder. Very easy to use and works like a charm. We love freshly grated nutmeg, especially on our Egg Nog Lattes and this grinder does the job and is so simple to use."
4,A kitchen gadget that really works as advertised!,"The handy dandy storage space can't handle large nutmegs, but the grinder does. It works like a charm."
5,Protects the camcorder,"This camera bag has served me well, I recommend it. My camcorder, extra tapes, and digital camera all fit inside, with padded adjustable end pockets inside to protect everything. I can use the extra zip pockets for cables and user manuals, always handy to have along. I confidently leave my valuable cameras sitting anywhere in this bag, and no harm has come to them these several years I've owned it."
4,"A ww II book of faith, family, and hope","The first in a series, these books are well written, and make you come back for more after each one. A definite faith builder."
5,Something to think about,I very much enjoyed reading this book. Some of the questions that Dr. Anapol brings up are very important to think about BEFORE getting into a poly relationship.This book encourages personal and spiritual growth. It also teaches that learning from things that make you uncomfortable is an important part of life. It also goes into different forms of honesty and how each is important.This book is Poly positive and life affirming. I highly recommend it.Ticia
4,very good,"This book always comes up in discussions about polyamory and its many forms. It is a great intro to polyamory, as well as a good reference for people already into the poly lifestyle. I found some important parts to be geared more for later in the relationship rather than introductory. But all in all, an excellent resource for polyamory."
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered this and when it came it was not the product I ordered. The product sent was not the carbon seatpost advertised.
2,"Mini, yes, mini yoda!","This Yoda is very little. If you are looking for a pillow size, this is not it! But over all it is a good little Yoda."
2,Buyer Beware - Your combination is out for the whole world to see,"While everything seems to be pretty good with this safe there is one MAJOR flaw in the process. Each safe comes with a preset combination that cannot be changed no matter what. AND, that combination is on a sticker on the back of the installation manual for all to see!!!I didn't pay too much attention to the combo since it was in such plain sight view that I was certain it was changeable. Apparently not.The response on their support line? The delivery guys don't pay too much attention to the combinations they see!!! This ""safe"" isn't all that safe with the combination out for the whole world to see."
4,Excellent presentation of an unpopular opinion,"The sad tragedy of this book's thesis is this: Any politician who brings up the senselessness of our current criminal justice system commits political suicide. The book exposes a big secret: violent crime is down, but media coverage of violence that is up! We've doubled prison terms and quadrupled the prison population to fight a phantom war on crime.Very well done, heartily recommenced.Would have been five stars, but in places he does make annoying asides about violence (and God knows why, sex) in entertainment."
4,Character study,"I could see persons I knew in the descriptions and actions of her characters. The way Ansay describes the people and their reactions to the events illustrated, for me, the way people wanted to accept the abnormal. Gabriel was never a person, but the representation of something they either didn't want to see in themselves or could not accept in themselves. It really gave me food for thought."
4,Compelling read,"I am very impressed with this author. I read ""Vinegar Hill"" first as an Oprah pick and while it was decent, I like this book much better. I grew up in a small town and can relate to the characters. I will read more of this author."
5,"An excellent, quick read","A testament to man&#65533;s desire to believe in something. &#65533;River Angel&#65533; is the story of how legend, belief and reality fuse in the fictional town of Ambient, Wisconsin. The circumstances surrounding the death of a child (Gabriel) lead some to believe that the child&#65533;s death was accompanied by a miraculous intervention from God. The death of Gabriel provides the opportunity for the town residents to affirm or denounce their belief in prayer, miracles and the will of an all-powerful God. The novel asks the reader to consider what he/she believes in, what you know to be true. There is no right or wrong answer, but the question and the pursuit of its answer is sure to be a remarkable journey - hopefully on the wings of an angel. Ansay&#65533;s writing is near flawless, her use of symbolism significant but not overbearing. An excellent, quick read."
5,Another terrific book by Ansay,"A. Manette Ansay has a distinct way of making you feel like you are right there in the middle of the storyline...that you know the chracters better than you know your own family..she address life as so many of us know,River Angel is about a unique boy who truly believed."
3,don't buy it used,I'm a fan of wilson's and have enjoyed his Historical Illuminatus series. I've hesitated to buy the 3rd volume because of it's limited availability and steep price for a used copy. Happily it will soon be reprinted so don't waste your money. See New Falcon for info.
4,Pentology?,I heard on a recent Art Bell interview of RAW that this thing (The Historical Illuminatus! Series) is supposed to be a pentology...
5,The best reference book about language,After reading (and after buying) almoust a dozen reference books about language I have to say that this one is just the best I found. Almoust perfect.
5,The best comprehensive introduction to language--we'd love a new edition!,"Based on this and his many other excellent books, David Crystal is a world heritage treasure! This book provides a stimulating introduction to language in a comprehensive way that I have found nowhere else. However, since its 1997 publication date there are exciting new developments in understanding language and its origins, including language acquisition, neurolinguistics, and semantics. We would love a new edition and hope the marvelous author has nothing else to do for the foreseeable future! Please convince him, Cambridge University Press!"
1,Freedom Force - XP SP2,Just a quick note to say I bought this game yesterday and today I find out it is not compatable with Windows XP SP2.There is supposed to be a patch being worked on but it is three months since this was first mentioned.I would recommend NOT buying this game if you have Windows XP SP2 - as its only useful as a drinks coaster unless a patch is made
4,POW! ZAP! KABOOM! Super Hero's!,"Great game, and very reasonable. Be warned though, the campaign is very short. Afterwards I got online and tried to play some multiplayer games. Everyone had at least 30,000 prestige hero's and the online matches only last about 5 minutes. Can't wait for the sequels."
1,I absolutely hated this game,"I know a lot of people loved this game, but I despised it. I bought it when it first came out, played it about a third of the way, put it away when I got stuck, and just now installed it again. Now I remember how much I hated it in the first place. The controls are just awful. You spend more time pausing the game than doing anything else because you cannot stack commands. The reaction time of some of the characters like Diablo are so ridiculously slow, it takes up to 2 full seconds before he moves after you click on him. By that time he takes a bullet to the face and dies.And the heroes are saddled with such horrible aim, yet when you're running around like crazy somehow the criminals tag you with a bullet when you're on the move.I'm going to pour gasoline on my copy and burn it."
2,"Help me Minuteman, I have gum on my shoe!","Freedom Force is good and bad, why? For starters it has such a weird combat system, and the mission objectives are dumb. When you start out the you have Minuteman, then you get Mentor who, next to a weasel could have worse attacks. If theres one thing that'll blow up your CPU it's the multiplayer option. It's fun, if you get it to work.EA also threw in a create your own character, which you never get to use. What's the good thing about FF? The graphics aren't too bad and there's some pretty cool animations.Save yourself [money]and go buy Spider-man instead."
1,Doesn't work with Windows XP Service pack 2!,"Don't buy this game if you're running Windows XP service pack 2.It doesn't run, and the developer apparently has no plans to fix it."
2,Could be great IF...,"This game would be great if the multiplayer part were fixed. I can never join a multiplayer game. If only this game were available on zone.com... In single player (since I was limited to this) I created a pretty nifty hero.... and I get to use him WHEN???? The game has a great concept, but it has serious issues."
1,DO NOT BUY IF HAVE XP WITH SERVICE PACK 2,"If you have Windows XP with Service Pack 2, this game will not work on your computer. In August, the makers had promised to make a patch when they had time. It is now February."
5,"""I don't want to hurt you!""","Perhaps the absolutely disatrous attempts by previous comic-book-based games hindered the sales of Freedom Force, but for whatever the reason, PC gamers, for the most part, missed out on an excellent title. The gameplay is easy, but takes a bit to master (as it should). The storyline is hilarously campy with intro movies for each character that should at least provide a chuckle. The characters are slightly customizable, enough to provide an RPG feel to the game, and gamers can create new characters or download their characters from modern comic books.I'll agree the game doesn't have great replay value, but it does have an online angle I never explored. Given the current market price, it is such a steal that the replay value is hardly an issue. I highly recommend this game if you were curious but afraid that it was going to be another comic book flop."
2,Definately not up to snuff.,"I really wanted this game so I bought it and was initialy impressed. However, the action is mild, and wears off fast, and the camera is only ok. In general, it's not that good of a game, even though it was criticaly acclaimed. It's a RTS game with little action and no ability to play the adventure with your own characters. Overall, forget it. It's no fun."
5,"Finally, a good superhero game!","Every one, let's all slap our heads and exclaim ""D'oh! Why didn't anyone think of this before?"" This is the game all of us fanboy geeks have been waiting for! A game that pays serious homage to 60's comic book characters! Each unique character is so authentic to the time period, you'd swear they were actually from a comic book. Each new character has a comic-style ""origin of"" cinema cutscene. Every level is designed like a comic book with authentic ""biffs"" and ""pows"" as you beat up Commies and other 60's scum. The game is wildly entertaining, even if you don't like comic books."
3,Expensive small dictionnary,The dictionnary has enough words for beginners but rapidly a bigger dict. is needed and the prices are outrageous. You're better off asking friends to bring you one when they come to visit.
4,they are good,I have used these for my heavy office keys for years. It doesn't rust or get dirty. I can fit my small motor scooter key in it The only problem is that they will occasionally open up in your pocket and you loose your supermarket swipe cards. If there was a way to lock it so that it wouldn't open.
5,perfect for stubborn keys,"This keyring is the only keyring I've found that can satisfactorily hold my keys. If your car key is bulky (especially smart keys or European keys), you'll find that it won't sit comfortably on a standard split ring. When on a split ring key ring, my car key would always stick out at an odd angle.I tried to use a flexible zip tie, and it worked for a bit until the zip tie started to wear down. I found that it would accidentally open frequently.Until I got this flexible cable ring. It's narrow enough that my car key fits easily and flatly. The screw attachment is secure enough that I don't worry about it opening accidentally. Lastly, the cable ring is large enough that I can hang it directly on my door knob.I've never paid for a key ring before, but I am so glad that I bought this."
3,Sturdy,"I guess I just didn't read the packaging well enough - it comes apart with a screw mechanism, not a flip or twist like some others. But it works fine and does the trick if you're looking for something less quick-release."
5,Very good start,"I thought this book offers a good start to reading the church fathers with a biblical view. it a good place to start. it dealt with some deeper issues, but really covered the depth of the fathers."
3,"Good, not really scholarly","This is a good book for getting people interested in the church fathers. I recommend it for that purpose. Beyond that, it comes across as a bit shallow. The major theme of the book is the controversy between allegorical and non-allegorical interpretation of Scripture. In a book written by Protestants to Protestants we expect the non-allegorical camp to win, but the reasons for this are not really thought through in the book. Do Origen's allegorical hemeneutics eventually lead to contradictions? The danger of this is acknowledged, but there are no examples given. This and similar inadequacies of the exposition make this a frustrating book. I am encouraged, however, to seek out the primary literature to find out for myself, however."
4,A fine introduction,"Hall does a fine job of touching on the some of the most salient points of patristic interpretation. It would do well as a secondary source for a Biblical Theology course, as he provides a great bibliography and direction for thinking about each of the fathers he covers.One critique: Too much weight is given to the notion that Post-modernism is EVERYONE'S problem when it comes to understanding the Biblical text. Some of us got over that a long time ago, or never had the problem to begin with.One thing lacking: direct examples of ""how"" the fathers did exegesis, the process of interpretation. This would be helpful for a furthering a sound Biblical method of hermeneutics based on their work. Otherwise, a great read."
3,Lipo in a box,It's fairly comfortable and provides a nice level of light support. But there is no way that this product provides firm control. It's good to help smooth out bumps and bulges but don't expect anything more than that. It's also a little pricey for what it does. Otherwise I found it to be very comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. But it does take a little maneuvering when it comes to using the restroom.
4,Pretty Good,"Don't expect miracles, but they do tone you up! The bra could be a little more uplifting. Not sure if they are worth $80, but the entire spanx-like underwear range is quite expensive."
3,"Like the concept, but................","I wear this occasionally and it works to hold in the bulges. I just wish it were made of slicker fabric i:e lycra. The cotton fabric does not let your dress or whatever else you are wearing lay properly. If it were lycra or some other slicker fabric I think it would work better. I would pay the same price for it. Like the leg part of the bodysuit as it gives you a cleaner line from waist to mid thigh. Trying to go to the bathroom with just the slit in the crotch is impossible. Save yourselves time and wet undies and take the whole thing down. I only made that mistake once. This really is a great product and I would put up with ""bathroom issues"", if only it were made of Lycra (manufacture's are you listening?)"
3,Lipo in a Box,It's a good product however I found that it clug to some of the materials my dresses were made from.
2,Waste of time....,"The garment does control anything. The sizing chart itself is a bit off, because I ordered a large and a medium perhaps would have given some support.Very disappointing indeed."
4,Fits and is Very Comfortable,"This is very true to size if you follow the weight chart! It gives a nice amount of support for big chested women, yet is lightweight so you can enjoy the affair you are wearing it to and not feel sucked in and tortured.. The only problem I have with it is worrying about the bathroom,,,,,,,sure there is a big enough gap to urinate ,,,,,but if you have to really go----I d have to take it all off to be sure. I took one star away for my bathroom issue.....but I love it!"
5,Love it!!!!!,"This is the BEST full-body shaper I've found! It's just the right support, not too hot, the underwires don't poke (although at an ""F"" cup size I find the support could be better) and you can wear a bra underneath if you want.It does take a little maneuvering to use the restroom without leaving a liquid trail, the crotch opening is large enough for the intended purpose. If you hand-wash it, it takes a long time to dry, so I've been machine-washing it (I was sent a zippered lingerie bag with it) and I pop it in the dryer anyway. It's not noticeable under knit pants and the legs are long enough so that they don't ride up.I am 6'2"", and the 2X bodysuit fits me almost perfectly so it might be too long on a short person. I highly recommend this shaper if you don't need the support of a girdle or extremely firm shaper."
4,ver helpful for anxiety and some beneficial chapters for depression,"This book helps in changing a person's life to being productive after having anxiety attacks. It encourages a person to control their lives and helps the person to overcome these difficulties. There are beneficial chapters for depression, as well, especially those related to positive self-talk, expectations, and lifestyle changes. It is considerably more focused on anxiety, so the benefits for depression are limited."
2,"Not worth the money, too easy, out of date, lots of mistakes","THERE ARE MUCH BETTER BOOKS AVAILABLE!This book is part of a group of books that the publisher wants you to buy together.I am a professional TOEFL instructor and I now have my own school. However, in 1996, I worked at another school that used these books for its TOEFL students. The students at that school (over 100) complained because the books were TOO expensive and TOO easy. NONE of the students thought the books were worth the price. The teachers also complained that the books were too easy and that there were a lot of mistakes in the books.Now, the books are so old that they are out of date. The TOEFL has become much harder in the past few years and, if you use this series of books, you will be shocked when you take the real test.You should buy the Official TOEFL and the Longman book instead.Good luck on your TOEFL!"

4,"If you want a high score in test, It's great!","I used the Heinle & Heinle Toefl Test Assistant : Listening for improving my Toefl score. It's great! because the problems and examples are very silimar to actual problems of Toefl tests. After studying this book, you can feel better when you take a test. Take this book, and practice! You will beat the Toefl."
2,Very weak magnet...,"The piece is nice looking, heavy, and is well built. However, the magnet is a joke. I tried putting a few of my knives on it vertically mounted and horizontally mounted. The knives tended to slip down or slide sideways. I am using relatively heavy knives (Calphalon Katana) so I tried cheap and lightweight knives, still had the same problem. If you stuck it to the magnet and held it in place for a few seconds it would stay put. But after a few more seconds it would start to slide. I couldn't even see using his for light weight rarely used knives. The magnet is a just a thick layer of the vinyl magnetic strip glued between two pieces of harder steel."
3,Left Strange Marks on Knives,"This knife strip works very well, as many have said. It is very strong, easy to install and extremely functional. I ran into one small problem with mine, however, in that it leaves a residue on my knifes after they've been stuck to it. The residue or stain is clear and just leaves little parallel streaks where my knives have been stuck. I've tried very hard to remove this residue, but it won't come off. I have no idea if washing the strip first would have solved this problem or if this is actually scraping my knives up. Most of my knives are pretty cheap so I'm not too concerned but I know some might be."
4,very heavy piece of wood with two heavy magnets embedded the length,"It will go up in my kitchen wherre i need the 24 inch length for my tools, knives...it is fairly heavy duty although the magnets are not the heaviest grabbing power i have seen in some of the newer specialty magnets."
5,Quality product clears up counter space,"I mounted this above the sink and it's allowed me to remove a big, clumsy knifeblock from my counter, freeing up valuable space. (It easily holds six knives from large chef's knife down to parer, which doesn't include everything in the knife block, but all that I use on a daily basis.) The hold is very strong and I never worry that I haven't set it tightly. The cherry finish is nice-looking, too. Highly recommend, especially at this price!"
4,Just a magnetic knife bar,I purchased this because I needed a magnetic knife bar for a few of my knives and scissors. As others have noted the included wall anchors are ok but I had no intentions of using them. With a quality wall anchor and a level it attached well an blends nice in my kitchen.Would definitely recommend it to others knowing up front get your own wall anchors.
2,Wood can crack easily,"If you're the type that likes to use your own screws, and get all industrial, be very gentle screwing your screws in or you'll screw up the wood. Mine cracked, even when I was being gentle on the second screw. If I'd known that, I would have bought its metal cousin."
2,Magnet not very powerful...,"Maybe I got a defective unit or perhaps they are all like this ... I don't know for sure. The one I got is doesn't have a very powerful magnet. Items tend to slide down, and if jossled enough they will fall OFF which is dangerous if you are hanging knives, and very dangerous for my toes!!! It is a shame that this has happened to me because this unit is very attractive and sturdy."
5,NORPRO MAGNETIC KNIFE HOLDER,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. IT CAME SO FAST I WAS IN SHOCK.ordered Sat evening, it arrived at my door MONDAY AFTERNOON.IT IS STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD ALL MY KNIVES, NO SLIPPING DOWN.thanks for a great product!"
1,Not recommended,"It looks great. But if you've had an ikea magnetic knife rack, you will never be happy with this one. I've lost knives and scissors behind the stove and fridge with this one, something that would never happen with my ikea one. The magnet is just not strong enough with the norpro. And most of my knives are small steak knives. They are not heavy. I'm very disappointed, would not order again and could never recommend it."
2,Too weak for my tools but Okay for knives,"I bought these to fit on the sides of my rolling tool chest for quick access to certain tools. The magnets are too weak for this purpose except for light weight tools (or knives since they have more area for gripping their blades) . I guess I have been spoiled by the Far Better magnet bars I purchased a couple of years ago from Amazon called --Master Magnetics Magnetic Tool Bar - 24in.W, Model# 07261 These other really strong magnet bars are currently holding my hammers, large chisels, heavy wrenches, and a small sledge hammer. I hate returning things unless they are completely useless, but I cannot recomend this product unless it is to be used for holding very light weight tools or flat bladed steel knives that are not non-magnetic stainless steel."
3,Doesn't work as well as Ikea Brand,Bought this because I moved out of the house where I had installed the ikea version. The knives are continually falling off. Not worth it unless you like trips to the ER
5,Nice,"Hung in the garage for knives used for filleting the fish my husband catches. Have 5 knives, 1 scissor and 1 straightener on it so far..."
2,"junk screws, good magnet","If you don't think you can drill holes don't buy this piece, because the mounting hardware is terrible. If you don't have a feer of handtools than the strong magnet used in this itek makes it pretty good."
2,Get your own screws,"This actually looks like a really good knife bar. It has a strong magnetic strip and looks good. However, the screws are incapable of being screwed into the bar with stripping them. We tried using both manual power and a drill, and we stripped both screws that came with the bar."
2,Thumbs Down,"I ordered this bar with the intention of mounting it to the wall in my garage and using it to hold tools. It is not very strong. It may hold a small knife or small screwdriver, but that is about it. Will not hold a normal sized tool."
2,Don't use the screws that come with the holder,The screws are weak and stripped as soon as you screw it into the holder when your walls are from an older home and harder. Get better screws before installing.
4,Very useful,"I have only been using this for a short time, so far it is working well . I needed to free up my very limited counter- space; so knives, meat forks, scissors etc. are now hanging up. I needed to drill an extra hole in the center of holder as it is very heavy plus all the items hanging on it. I felt it needed a little extra anchoring, also used hole anchors."
5,Wonderful,"Funny and sad. I saw Wreckless Eric perform at The Hope And Anchor pub in London, and I have all of his albums. I am a huge fan of his music. His prose writing was a surprise. This book is wonderful and I am very glad I purchased it. I wish Mr. Goulden all the luck in the world, and thank him for the pleasure he has given me."
1,It's not a pack of 5,"I order this product awhile back and they only sent 1 piece, not 5 pack as they stated.I sent them a e-mail and they told me it was a mistake and I told them them it's on yourweb site and I was told, it will be taken down and here it is.. months later and it's still showinga 5 pack deal. I am not saying what this company is doing is bait and switch. But nothinghas change since I made my complaint to them.Right now, I need 10 more pieces and no, I will not buy from this company again."
1,Can't get the...software to work.,"This software won't load onto a brand new PC. I've had to browse into the disk to load the pieces of the program, and even then it works only spottily. Takes forever to pieces to load -- and this is with an up-to-date system. I have another friend who's in the computer business and he's had a lot of frustrating problems with this program for his kids, too."
4,Challenging and cool,"First of all you start the game as Pepper, a pizza delivering dude with the food. But as soon as you give a pizza order to the evil Brickster, he escapes. While exploring lots of different islands this game offers challenging sub-games and fun adventures. The last level can be very frustrating because it freezes and thats why I gave it 4 stars but the whole game is just plain fun. You can ride in the skatepark and play any sub-game that you have already won. There are tons of ways to explore, by dinosaur , by helicopter, and more! To sum it all up, Lego Island 2 is a great game except for it takes to long to load but the gameplay is beutiful with sharp grafics."
1,It don't work!,"Now, I realise that computers are different from PC to PC. But mine exceeds the requirements. I have WIN98SE. I'm very good with computers. Lego Island Xtreme works perfectly. Lego Racers 2 locks up on occation, but works good most of the time. But this thing won't even load. The screen starts to go black and then there's an error, drop to desktop. Annoying! Gonna try it with another machine soon. But I'm glad I didn't pay much for this because somebody gets whatever money I paid (not amazon, got it elsewhere) and I get a game that doesn't work. Very flawed series on the programming side. Buyer beware of products from Lego. Read user comments before you buy."
4,Seems to work fine,"My older fire alarm was getting on in years, and since these things needs to be changed every 8 to 10 years, I decided to change them all.These are battery operated, and so if you have a wired installation this should not be used in such situations.Installation was quick - my only wish is that there are adjustable width screw holes to hang this up with, so one could use preexisting screws. Its not hard - just that it takes a 2 more minutes to put in another screw.I tested it after installation by holding a match about 2 feet under it, and it sounded the alarm in about half a minute. Its been in operation about 3 weeks now, and so far there have been no false alarms."
5,Front load is the outstanding feature,"smoke detectors:ionization type are low current drain, photoelectric are high drain. This is why most (but not all) photoelectric are 120 volt AC instead of battery. ionization detectors last longer than photoelectric between battery changes.so called 10 year detectors or regular detectors with so called 10 year batteries will not go 10 years before replacing is necessary. Longer, but not 10 years, just read some of the reviews on Amazon about this!interconnected detectors (wired or wireless) all sound together if just one is triggered, thus you can hear *any* alarm from farther off, this is a great safety feature.front load: This is a safety feature especially with high ceiling mounting when perched on a ladder because there is much less manipulation required to change the darn batteries.---My choice of desired features is to get a front load instead of the other considerations. Your preferences are likely different! :)"
2,Didn't work for me.,"Overall appearance is good and the front load battery is a very nice feature. That says it all for this smoke alarm. The very audible alarm sounds when ever it feels like it. Scares you to death and isn't easy to shut it off with the button provided to silence it. No wonder they designed it with a easy open front load battery as sometimes you have to remove the battery to shut it off. I took it down and removed the batteries so it couldn't sound. They are both back in the box they came in and on a shelf in my closet to be thrown away later. By the way they were no where near the kitchen, or garage, or any place in the house that would cause this problem. I recognize the brand as good but I guess I just got a couple of bad ones."
5,Xmas present for my father,"I bought this watch locally for my father for Xmas a few weeks ago, and I must say it is a very nice watch that looks like it should be worth a lot more than it is! He really loves it too, so that's important ;)The version with the metal bracelet is nice too, but it is quite heavy, this one is suitably light for casual and sports use. And the orange/black contrast is unusual, but very eye-pleasing."
2,Nice face... no heart,"I bought this unit a year ago on a whim... and I must say I'm completely disappointed with it. The device is supremely user UNfriendly.Me, I am very computer literate, college educated and love gadgets... nonetheless, this unit defies logic. Even with the manual in hand, setting its functions is near impossible. I like the looks but that's it. No backlight on a $400+ watch? Absurd. Want to use multiple time zones... better have at least a Masters from MIT. People... it's a watch for goodness sake... not a detonator! Can't recommend this one at half the price."
4,Authentic Chinese Cuisine,"This is more of an advanced cookbook, at least for me. I bought ""Chinese Cooking Made Easy"" at the same time and that book is more homestyle cooking while this book has more restaurant-quality dishes. I was a bit dismayed at first and thought I was in over my head but the section on soups (Eight treasures soup in winter squash or what I call winter melon soup; Black mushrooms and chicken's feet soup) at the back of the book have made this purchase worthwhile. The book has VERY authentic Chinese dishes.The series by the Wei Chuan publishers are very good and I love the way the books are set up and they all have pretty pictures for each dish. I even love the way the books are wrapped in a sturdy plastic to keep the cover clean.I am lucky I live in Toronto where there is a great Chinatown because many of these ingredients can be hard to find. If you are interested in learning to cook authentic Chinese cuisine, this book will lead you in the right direction."
1,So disapointed!!!!,"I purchased this book because the reviews seemed great. Well I could not believe it. There isn't a fried rice recipe, nor regular recipes like you would buy at your local chinese restaurant. I wasn't interested in gourmet chinese cooking. Honestly 98% of the recipes turn me off. Don't spend your money, it is a total waste. You're better off getting recipes on the web."
5,Completely Authentic. . .,"My mother (who is Taiwanese) has a couple books by the author and when I started to stock up on my own collection of cookbooks I bought this.The recipes are excellent, with a photo of each completed dish. There is also a side comment in most of the recipes that tell which style of Chinese cooking the dish hails from (Peking, Cantonese, Taiwanese, etc.)Many recipes I hadn't even heard of or tried even though my mother makes a LOT of Chinese food. This really excited me because of the opportunity this presents to me. I was even surprised to see a recipe for shrimp that I had tried once in a restaurant that I enjoyed. I was under the impression that I would never be able to find a recipe for that!On the other hand, this book is not for the faint of heart. The book has no ""Americanized"" recipes and incorporates many dishes that Americans would find repulsive. Soup with chicken feet in it, anyone?"
2,remote entry,keys remote were not in greatest shape. spray painted clear to look like it was newer and they have to be right next to car to work
1,keyless entry remote 97 honda accord,Unfortunately the product did not work. Need to take the vehicle to a locksmith or auto shop to trouble shoot the item and vehicle together. This vehicle doesn't have a valet switch in order to program the remote.
5,best recordings of the full Wasps suite and Somerset Rhapsody,"A pleasant all around collection, for those looking for a good sampler of the 20th century English idiom. Norman del Mar, (an often overlooked conductor in field crowded with such luminaries as Boult, Glorious John Barbirolli, and Vernon Handley)gives them all their due. However, on ""The Wasps"" and ""Somerset Rhapsody"", he gives us somewhat more than that; these are the standout pieces in my opinion. The ""Wasps"" in particular blows all the other renditions out of the water. The sound is phenomenal. Worth finding on Amazon marketplace."
5,Great toddlers and adults,Music both kids and adults can enjoy multiple times a day. Music won't annoy adults like a Barney type song if your child wants to listen and watch the DVD over and over.
4,She cant stop dancin,"My granddaughter loved this dvd. She cant stop dancing around the house. Shes so cute. The stars sing great songs, they had me singing along with them."
5,Love all the music!,This is a bunch of songs back to back! Our 11 month old loves it! I bought it on our kindle and take it with us!
2,Songs aren't as clever as Sesame Street Usually Is,We were disappointed in this DVD. We've seen some clever and hip songs on the TV show and were hoping for the same on this DVD. Our daughter doesn't dance when this is on.
5,Loved this one,Great music CD for kids and there are some really great artists on this one. Highly recommended. Get this one.
3,GOOD ITEM,"SOLID GOOD QUALITY EASY TO KEEP TRACK OF. SIMPLE TO OPERATE. WORKS WELL WITH SILENT FLASH OR FLASH AND CLICK SOUND PER BEAT SETTING. ONLY CONS ARE BULKY, CAREFUL WHEN SHUTTING OFF AND STORING, AS YOU CAN MISTAKENLY TURN THE SWITCH TO FLASH ONLY AND RUN DOWN THE BATTERY WITH OUT KNOWING."
2,"It's a metronome - it keeps time well, but...",It has no volume control on it and it is REALLY loud and gets very annoying. I have to put it face down under a pillow sometimes when I'm practicing. After 20 minutes with this thing I think I'm going insane. All other features are fine but I would not buy this again.
4,Very Happy with this,"It's a metronome, you can switch between sound with light & just flashing light. It's palm-sized. I wish it had volume control."
4,works great!,"I am just learning to play the guitar and needed a metronome to practice with. I have no experience with any other nomes, but this works great. Don't think the light is that useful. If you want something basic and easy to use this is it for a reasonable price. Only wish it had a volume control for the clicks."
5,Excellent,"I am pleasantly surprised with this product. It ""tocks"" instead of beeping. I wanted to buy the traditional ones that ""tocks"" but they were too expensive. This is a perfect substitute especially for a beginner musician. I can see how the ""tocks"" might not be loud enough for more advance performers but it's perfect for my 7 year old who is just beginning to play the piano. Her playing does not overpower the metronome sound."
2,The trembling of a leaf,"I am a big fan of Sumerset Maugham. The problem with this particular book (and it does not happen in any other I have read/bought) is that it is full of typos!There are repeated phrases; using form instead of from; too instead of to.. etc. The amount of errors is unprecedented and I wonder is this some sort of ""off brand"" reprint??I would suggest looking for a different maker for these stories. It must be out there."
2,"Nice graphics, horrible game play","I am running a very well equipped Dell. For those who have a top of the line system, Tiger Woods 2002's graphics cannot be beat. If you are running a slower system, buy TW99 .... If you enjoy having to play for hours straight before even learning how to drive the fairway, then TW2002 is for you. I put in hours upon hours of play in TW99 and expected my proficiency to turn over for this game; it did not. Putting is hellish, and putting draw and fades on the ball is just short of immpossible. The only reason this game got any stars at all is because of the graphics. I have returned mine and will revert back to TW99 or the latest version of LINKS. There is not target indicator and for the non die hard gamer this game will merely instill deep frustration."
4,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2002 comes close to matching LS2001,"First, I am avid pc golf fan ever since the orignal PGA Golf came out years back. While I think Links has better game play golf wise, Tiger's PGA is nothing to complain about for it does have solid game play in its own right. The graphics in my opinion is much better in Tiger Woods PGA than Links 2001, I still don't get when the ball lands in Links you see a little trail line (unrealistic!). The trees actually move, ball splashes and leaves ripples in the water, and the crowd actually moves unlike Links where all you see is dots flying across the screen (these are supposed to be birds). Online play is better in Links for you have more options and from what I hear TWPT20002 is only supposed to be good for a year (which isn't bad I guess). Designing a course is a little easier with Tiger's PGA than it is with Links 2001, so I might switch over to Tiger Woods PGA."
3,Not what I thought....,"I bought this today to play on my laptop which easily meets the minimum requirements but the game looks terrible. the game play is pretty fun, though. I like the pros and the courses but this doesn't look nearly as good as Links. Definitely not as realistic - it looks sort of cartoony but maybe it's time to upgrade my PC..."
5,Excellent!,"This is my new favorite bellydance cd. Great extended version of Alf Leyla wi Leyla, which is not a techno version like all the other CD's I've heard. Highly recommended!"
5,I remember the day Midnight Moo was printed,"I worked for Federated Lithographers-Printers, Inc. in Providence, RI, the company that printed the first Midnight Moon, and I was the CSR that handled Harper & Row (the original publisher) when it was produced. The artwork was wonderful, and the huge sheetfed press (we got 2 sets of book, jacket, and cover out of one sheet of paper) did a fabulous job. I received a sample of the book and gave it to my sister for Christmas that year. She had twin girls and the story quickly became their favorite. A few years later a third daughter arrived and she, too, loved the story. Their copy wore out long ago. I'll tell her it's back in print. The girls have daughters of their own now (no grandsons yet), and maybe they'd like copies as well."
1,Piece of JUNK!,This gun is a piece of junk! It started to break a week after i got it. The cheap plasic would crack and splinter on every shot fired. There are loose BB's and plastic parts rattling in it. Now it won't even shoot! DO NOT BUY THIS GUN(unless you are stinkin' rich and have money to throw away)!
1,worst shotgun ever,"This is the worst gun in the entire world. The second I got it I was stunned by how cool it looked. I loaded it up and cocked it back and fired it and the nozzle broke off and shortly after the pump broke off. But there was an even worse problem. You know what they used to add weight to this gun? SAND IN A PLASTIC BAG!!!! The plastic bag got a hole in it the very next day and it leaked sand in my family room, living room and garage this gun SUCKS!"
4,Good Gun,"A Very nice gun, shoots out very good, I was shooting with the BB's it came with (even those are usually quite cheap-o's so I recomend getting some store bought ones) but anyways it shattered every BB it came with when i shot a wall, so there some proof it's strong. Only Bad point is that when you have BB's in the compartment, some just randomly get consumed into the back part and you can hear them bouncing around, overall, good gun"
1,DO NOT BUY--PIECE OF JUNKY PLASTIC,"DO NOT BUY THIS GUN!!!!!!!!! You may think that it's better because it says ""HIGH POWER"" shotgun... But really it isn't...When I opened the box, the stock had a crack on the top... I was shooting paper targets (which, by the way, the bbs couldn't go through) and the trigger broke. I took less than 100 shots with it and the trigger just suddenly went loose and now it won't shoot (and I wasn't even being rough with it). Don't waste your $20 with it (about $28 with shipping). Just go to Wal-mart and buy a better gun that is actually made of good hard plastic and metal for $25. DO NOT EVER BUY THIS GUN!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND/OR GO TO WAL-MART AND BUY A BETTER GUN!!!!"
1,Complete Crap,I got this gun a month ago and it worked for about a week. Until the piece of crap broke. I opened the gun and found that a tiny plastic piece that makes the gun shoot broke right off. Then I found out why the gun was so heavy. They put a 3 pound bag of sand in the stock. I would never recomend this gun to anyone it just a waste[...]
1,A dissapointment,"This product looks cool right out of the box, its a great replica gun. However, after firing no more than 3 shots, the gun busted into two pieces. Now it makes a great replica statue in my room. Wouldn't recommend this product!"
1,This gun stinks!,"I got this gun today, cocked it, and the pump action broke off of the gun. What a rip off! I wouldn't buy one of these if I were you."
2,too...well...country,I guess I'm out of that country-look phase that was so popular a couple decades ago. None of these designs interest me now except the sampler on the upper right of the cover. But there are other more intense samplers I'm interested to do so I know I won't do this one.
4,Thrilling page turner,"Gail Giles impressed me with Shattering Glass, and I was hoping for something like that with Playing in Traffic. Even though this book didn't wow me as much as Shattering Glass, it kept me enthralled and waiting for the next event.Most interesting in the book is not the ""dangerous"" relationship between main character Matt and Goth-girl Skye, but rather it's the bond between Matt as a brother and his younger sitster Katy (who he finds out is only his half sister). When Katy discovers the truth and that Matt knew all along, the emotion Giles has built leaves an emptiness in the pit of your stomach.Another element that deserves applause is her credible, thrilling, and close to over-the-top ending. Definitely worth the read."
3,Nuttier than a fruit cake,"What the hell? That was my first thought of the character Skye in the book. This girl is crazier than an out house rat on meth. She lies, steals, has sex, gets violent, does drugs, and last but not least wants someone to off her parents. Skye's chosen one is a teenaged boy who prefers to blend in and fly under the radar at all times. When Matt falls for Skye he is taken in by her crazy charm and outlandish lies. He wants to help her..She wants him to do the unthinkable. Sometimes no one gets what they wish for."
1,A Book Worth Burning,"Well, okay, maybe not-- book burning is a Very Bad Thing. But so is this book. To call the book vile is to slander everything else you think of as vile. The author picks an easy target to vilify-- a tempting bit of Goth girlhood-- and uses her to show the evil that women do. It's like those old movies they showed in Health Class 30 years ago, where the drunk pregnant girl with an STD bends over to pick up her cigarettes while driving and crashes her car. Boogah, boogah. I wouldn't call the author a simpleton-- she can write well enough, but the book is written at the black and white level, and children reading it will either be alarmed, scared, or laugh it off as the rubbish it is. I wouldn't give it to any of my four children, and good parents and teachers everywhere should follow my lead."
5,Inventive machining,This book is absolutely engrossing. Mr. Chan is inventive and does a great job of demonstrating how to re-create his designs.
2,a book of basics,"After receiving this book and reading it i was able to get a few good ideas out of it, but a lot of the content is basic knowledge and things you should have learned in wood shop when you went to High School."
5,Classic Joints with Power Tools,"I know Yeung and have taken a number of classes with him. At first, I was surprised to hear that he was writing a book on power tools. He is the master of hand work skill and sensitivity. His philosophy of furnituremaking is one of respectfulness and thoughtfulness about the wood, the design of the peice and the process of creating it. This book on using power tools carries this philosophy through in the directness and clearity of his discritptions, explaination and instruction. His familiarity of the process of joinery is so complete that the information flows to the reader as if they are having a friendly converstaion with Yeung about the ins and outs of what to do and how to do it. I recommend this book fully."
2,Nice while it lasts,"I bought this less than a year ago to tote my baby's bottles around. It worked pretty well. With an ice pack, it keeps his bottles cold for hours, and the drink pouch on the side is useful for stashing all sorts of things.Unfortunately, the bag isn't as durable as I expected. The seams and zippers are holding, but there were holes in the neoprene itself after only six months of regular use -- and I'd been washing it VERY sparingly. The bag retains moisture and takes on a mildewy funk (complete with mildew) pretty quickly on a hot day, so I imagine some folks won't get more than a few months use out of this before it falls apart, if it's washed as often as it needs to be.It would be well worth the price if it was more durable. If you only need something a couple times a week, it might be perfect."
4,Let's do lunch!,I love my new lunch tote. It's quite stylish and seems to keep my food reasonably cool.
4,Glad To Have This Collection,"Yes, I'm glad to have this collection of songs to listen to whenever I want. We saw Martha Scanlan perform at a Midnight Ramble in Woodstock, and her songwriting got to me. The venue ran out of her CDs that night, so I had to get it from Amazon. I remember loving one song in particular--how the words seemed to tumble down the chord, for lack of a better description. So I was so happy when that ended up being the first song on the CD--""The West Was Burning"". Song after song will hook you. Her lyrics are evocative, her voice transporting, and her rhythms varied and familiar. Of course, since Levon Helm is her drummer, she had an advantage!"
5,Art Up Close,This book is great for learning more about art. Giving to young people; great intro to art.
3,Slightly disappointing,"The ""Ultimate Mahjongg"" and ""Arcade Mahjongg"" titles are very entertaining and have beautiful graphics. The 3D Mahjongg is just bizarre. I couldn't figure out how to play the game and there were no instructions. Graphics were so poor that I couldn't find a match. There were graphics and performance issues with the remaining games as well. So, the price was a little steep for the actual number of games I actually was able to enjoy."
2,Must insert the damn CD every time you play,"This game is okay as a timewaster between emails, but even after you install it you'll have to locate and insert the CD every time you play. Too bad for you if you have other projects that require the CD drive. Very annoying to find this out after paying $20.00 for what I thought would be a fully functional game."
2,It don't work in windows vista,"This is a fine game for wasting time. Better than free cell. Most of the tile sets are difficult to read but the ""original"" types are not bad.But it don't work on Vista so far as I can tell; it comes up but you can't move the tiles."
4,Vintage Merle,"This album has one of the greatest songs ever written ""Me and Crippled Soldiers"" is one of the most enlightening songs I have ever heard."
5,Incredibly Beautiful,"I have searched for 5 years for a replacement as I lost my original copy during a move and have missed the soft, delicate notes that mingle every so peacefully with the whispers of nature. I am delighted to have found a copy and encourage everyone to listen to this magical album--you won't be disappointed!"
3,Intersting story line,"The Methusela Gene has a couple of villians you will love to hate, a monster you can almost root for and a main character whom you can feel sorry for. All of this is almost wasted when the author realizes the book is long enough and he doesn't want to end the story in the quality fashion he used during the initial 80%. I read this on my Kindle and kept paging back thinking that I had skipped part of the story with my fat thumbs having advanced the pages too fast. Alas that was not the case. The story ends as one might hope it would albiet without 2 chapters of how to get from the middle of some coastal body of water, process the wonder gene, and then administer the wonder gene."
4,Pretty good,"This book reminded me of the kind of horror films that are on Cinemax at 2 o'clock in the morning. For the most part it's fun if you can suspend your disbelief. There are some passages that bog down in pseudo-science fiction {basically chemistry text}, and some of the characters and dialogue are contrived and seem to be taken from a 1940's gangster movie, but mostly it's a lot of fun. The pacing is very fast and the characters are interesting enough that you won't skip ahead to find the next giant crab attack. Monster fans {like me} will like the crab as it is presented very well. The descriptions of NJ are detailed and accurate, and the main character's wife seems to be extremely hot. It's a lot of fun, check it out."
3,biological future,"Interesting story, worth reading.. general rate as good.. story line flows, characters are good and the whole thing is believable .. i gave it a 3 because it is forgettable.."
2,No Heroes,"The story line was actually very good.However, it was genuinely difficult to get close to the good guys in this book. One was an elderly scientist with no back-bone that dumped huge amounts of bio-hazardous material into the local water flow. Another indirectly caused severe injury to one person and the death of three others because he lied to a good friend (hey, he had a really good personal reason). Still another was a government goon that used force and intimidation to ensure that mankind remained unaware of one of the most important discoveries since fire. His reason.........to avoid government budget problems.At least the bad guys were real bad guys."
1,Great goggle -- bad shipping by Amazon,These goggles are EXACTLY what my daughter needs to wear. My only problem with TYR is that Amazon was the ONLY place that still had these in stock. My daughter swims competitively and goggles are important.Problem is we are ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY and we live in Europe. The shipping is US -- to an FPO (Fleet post office box) in NY. Amazon ships books to FPO's but little else. I had to have these shipped to a friend who had to PAY to ship them to me. I ONLY use AMAZON when I have NO choice because their shipping policy has gotten very poor for those of us US CITIZENS living in Europe. Enjoy your free market economy at our expense!!
2,My daughter only wore these when she was desperate,"I bought these goggles along with a number of other pairs to try out. These were NOT the favorite. The clear winning goggles were the Aqua Sphere Kaiman Small goggles. My son kept forgetting to take them off after swimming, can't beat that!"
5,best goggles ever!,"When my son put on the goggles for the first time, those were his exact words! We had to buy another pair for younger brother."
4,decent cutting mats,"Not much to say for these. We have been using them for a few years now and am just now getting around to putting in reviews on various products that we purchased over this period of time. They are thin, lightweight, durable, handle the dishwasher ... inexpensive product that works.Jim, Phoenix, AZ"
2,Needs a non-stick backing,"Flexible, stylish, but hampered by the fact they slide over the counter when cutting.There are better products: just search for non-skid flexible cutting boards on Amazon."
5,Help Me Before I Go Crazy: Adventures From A Working,"Help Me Before I Go Crazy...confirms my long-held suspicion that in spite of the daily struggle to get little people out of bed, and into the tub, dressed, fed, and out the door with completed home assignments, signed permission slips, gym clothes and packed lunches in tow, there is a small current of unfathomable joy which every child brings to give Mommy another reason to do it all again the next day. My utmost respect is due to Ms. Nightingale, my sister, Traci, and the millions of moms who do this every day. It is truly the most important work you will ever do."
1,Where Platitudes Prevail,"This is certainly not a thinking woman's guide to a working mother's life. If countless platitudes, empty rhetoric, and weak humor are your thing, this is the book for you."
5,Great book - but get the newer edition,"This is a terrific guidebook, but you're missing out on a LOT of updates and additional information by buying this ""pocket"" edition (the 1st edition published in 1999) instead of the 2nd edition published in 2002. The new version has about twice as many photos, updated maps where things have changed, updates and additional contact information (phone numbers, websites), elevation profile maps, and profiles of people who were some of the ""founders"" of the hobby of Highpointing (Jack Longacre and Paul Zumwalt).So do another search for ""Highpoint Adventures"" and look for the newer version. Or get both (the little one for your backpack and the new one for enjoying a good read & planning your trip)."
5,A very helpful book...,"...and small enough to bring on the hikes with us. My son loves both of the highpointing books we bought him on Amazon.com, they are worth MUCH more than their actual prices."
5,I love these,"These are great for traveling. Some hotels have these but most of them don't.I give these as presents all the time. Everyone loves them especially men who do not like to thread a needle. Who does!!Great for college kids, too. Keep one at the office."
4,Best of the WWF #17 (WF060),Best of the WWF #17 (WF060)05/27/88 Dino Bravo vs. Ken Patera07/23/88 Big Bossman vs. Sam Houston06/21/88 King Haku coronation07/23/88 British Bulldogs vs. Nikolai Volkoff & Boris Zhukov07/25/88 Jacques & Raymond Rougeau vs. The Rockers03/06/88 Honkytonk Man vs. Brutus Beefcake06/01/88 Demolition vs. Tito Santana & Rick Martel08/06/88 Andre the Giant vs. Jim Duggan (lumberjack match)
3,Worth seeing for Demolition vs. Strike force match,"This was the best match on the tape, hailing from the OaklandColiseum. This was the match where Demolition layed outRick Martel for many months to come. This match is a classicfrom 1988, several weeks after Wrestlemania after StrikeForce. Demolitions was still on a tear, but Martel and TitoSantana, who just went to the WWF Hall of Fame give usa great effort. Actually they shouldnt won, it took a chairshot and elbow to the throat to knockout Martel.Very vicious match.The other match that had me interested was the Lumberjackmatch with Hacksaw vs. Andre, this was the peak of theirrivarly after Hacksaw embarassed Andre on national tvby knocking him out with the two by four!!!Other matches including the Rockers vs. Rougeas and KenPatera weren't bad.For 9.99 for which I bought it wasn't bad. Two thumbs up"
4,70's music lover,"I have this CD and enjoy it very much, though I think the version on rino is better, because of the wider selection of songs. But better still would be a rerelease of Lobo's ""A SIMPLE MAN "" on CD."
3,Lobo - 'Greatest Hits' (Curb Records),"Not my usual choice of music here, but I'll say this much for Lobo (born Roland Kent LaVoie) - is that he certainly had the voice for memorable AM pop / soft rock as such. Tunes like ""I'd Love You To Want Me"", ""Me And You And A Dog Named Boo"" and ""Where Were You When I Was Falling In Love"" tend to spark a certain 'familiar' vibe of days gone by when I heard them for the first time in (maybe) at least thirty years now. If I remember correctly, my parents liked this artist. Will appeal to fans of Seals & Crofts, Cat Stevens and Climax. Call him like a David Cassidy / Bobby Sherman wanna-be if you want."
5,A Great Book for Understanding DSP/Control Fundamentals,"This is the first book to cover the topic of Control Systems and DSP with practical applications. It is very comprehensive, yet easy to understand through several examples. The book is an asset to graduate students or practicing engineers in Control Systems and/or DSP field."
3,Not Sister Fidelma stories,"I was expecting this to be a collection of Sister Fidelma mysteries, but there's only one in the collection. I dutifully slogged through them, but would not recommend it as his best writing."
2,disappointed,He's a very good writer but this collection is uneven and at times boring. It has a few good stories but for the rest there's just something missing.
5,For people who enjoy a good drink,This show is great for those who love to travel or at least who love to try different drinks from other countries. It is pretty funny and is informative at the same time!
5,Enjoyed this DVD set to no end,Bought this DVD just recently and all the cartoons in it I remembered well compleate with the eathenic (sp?) content put back in as they were made back in the day. Now that I have seen this it is time we got a vote together for a DVD of Spike (or Butch) shorts! THOSE were funny as all outdoors. The one I want most on that set is Rock a Bye Bear where the bear HATES NOISE!! Plus one with a cat who throws the voice and another where he is guarding a garden...great stuff! Love MGM cartoons for their site gags and Tex Avery was tops in the field!!
2,Warner in the dog house,"How frustrating it is that the Droopy set is not restored. The same inferior transfers used on VHS and laserdisc are once again recycled for DVD. Of the few widescreen cartoons that do look good, the series ran out of gas by then."
4,"100% uncut, with some visual flaws - great set overall","The two previously censored cartoons: DROOPY'S GOOD DEED, and DAREDEVIL DROOPY, are both completely uncut on this set, the former of which was even edited on the Compleat Tex Avery laserdisc!Sadly, 4 of the cartoons feature DVNR artefacts (where the characters appear warped and blurred due to botched film restoration), which is 4 too many, but don't let that put you off, because the other 20 range from good to excellent in terms of quality. The Cinemascope cartoons look especially good.So, it's a shame that it's not a complete replacement for the 1993 Laserdisc set, but it's still a must-have."
2,"Poor quality and ""not"" uncut","The DVNR tranfers are horrible and this set is not completely ""uncut"". ""Droopy's Good Deed"" for example is edited and missing the entire scene of Spike saving a black woman from the log cabin fire. My associate has a complete copy with the woman saved by Spike in his animated film collection and shows it to friends on occasion. Too bad WB did not try harder to use original material sources for this set, such as a ""red"" lion title card print for ""Droopy's Good Deed""."
3,Disc 1 is the real prize here...,"There's not much to say about this product-- if you enjoy Droopy cartoons, you'll want to purchase this item. Sadly, most of the good stuff is on disc one. The second disc is lower quality animation, reused gags, and a severely different design for Droopy and the cast. Some of the plots are lifted wholesale from the original Tex Avery shorts. But again, if you're a fan, you can't miss it. At $20, it's a bit high, but should this item ever drop to $15 or less, snap it up. It'll be a good value."
4,still funny,"back in the day i use to watch droopy all the time. that dead pan talking tone of droopy would crack me up. this collection is cool because when Droopy looks into the camera and gives his take on a situation you are gonna crack up. now the drawings and things are basic when compared to today's high tech elements,but the laughs are still there. droopy wasn't that dog you'd mess with."
4,THE LONG WAIT IS OVER!,"I have waited many years for a comprehensive DVD collection of Droopy cartoons to appear. Until now all that was available was a badly-burned bootleg set with faulty sound and color. Now, thankfully, the long wait is over. ""Tex Avery's Droopy - The Complete Theatrical Collection"" gathers togerher all 24 cartoons, completely uncut and restored.I give this set 4 stars due to several shortcomings. The cartoons were processed with DVNR, which blurs some lines on some frames. While this in no way renders any cartoon unwatchable, it is noticeable. Also, while the color is excellent, the film clean-up could have been a little better. Finally, there should have been more extra features and commentaries. All in all, though, this set is essential, and well worth getting."
3,They don't make them like this anymore,"Droopy cartoons included on this disc are not quite as funny as I remember them as a kid. There are at least two duplicate episodes on the two disc set. I don't quite understand why that was done. I bought this set for a particular episode which, sadly, was not included in this set. I was under the impression this was the entire collection of Droopy cartoons. Anyway had a few laughs as I watched, though my 12 year old son grew pretty tired of them after the first few episodes. The service was great and everything arrived as/when promised."
4,NICE TO HAVE,"I'm not the biggest fan of DROOPY, but I always liked Tex Avery frantic animation.The quality of the cartoons is pretty good, as long as Avery has a hand in it.The worst cartoons in this collection are the last ones, where Hanna/Barbera took over production.They knew how to beat a joke to death and render an idea unfunny.One of the Tex Avery cartoons is disembowled and re used as a later cartoon without much credit given to its creator.One star off for that."
4,Great seeing these again.,"Lately, the different cartoon networks have been showing less and less of the classics. It's great seeing them uncensored. Yes, there are repeated gags. Yes, there are a few that are not by Tex Avery. There's even one that's almost a scene for scene remake, only in cinemascope. And some of the non Avery ones are pretty good. If you are a classic animation fan, you should have this."
5,tex avery's droopy,love it. it had all the classic uncut versions. the racial issues were indicative of the mentality during that time. today many may feel it as inappropriate but the bleeding hearts should take it for it's intended worth...humor.
3,Wait...Droopy's a dog?,"At the beginning of both DVDs, there is a disclaimer addressing the issues of sexism and racism in the cartoons. I am an African-American who watched Droopy during my childhood in the late 70s and early 80s and was taught that this kind of creativity was the way things were back in the days when they were made. The cartoon can serve as a medium for teaching today's youth how some things in the USA have changed and some have not, both for the good and the bad. Today, it is definitely a different kind of USA.Was I offended by what I saw? YES!Do I recognize that people who are different from me would be offended by what they'd see? YES!Was I entertained? I would be lying if I didn't say, ""often times, YES!"""
5,cartoon form droopy,i enjoy watching old cartoons and was searching for bugs bunny and ive always enjoyed droopy as well so after getting the droopy dvd i was really happy to watch droopy once more.
1,These lights discourage me....,"They discourage me in regards the reliability of other solar powered lights. I have had the exact same problems as the other two reviews had, but I also was not very happy at the fact that when they did stay lit they didn't light up brightly. I am thinking about buying some different lights, but I think I will do some serious inquiring beforehand, and buy maybe only one to see how they work before I get any others in that brand. These things are too expensive to not work good....if they work well then the &quot;expensiveness&quot; becomes not so expensive and worth the price."
1,"They looked good, but...","I bought these last summer and I am so disappointed with them. They are very pretty, but aren't made well. When putting these together some of the plastic pieces that are steaked into the ground broke off aroung the edges. Then I had to work on some of the lights to get the bar holding the light out to stop sliding down the upright bar. They also never wanted to stay standing up. The light seems to tilt the pole over and they aren't sturdy. Most disappointing of all, they didn't last. The lights won't even stay on for an hour now. I took them up and now they are resting in my garage because I was so embarrassed to have them out anymore. I would replace the batteries, if I could find some solar powered ones, but no luck."
2,What happened?,"I received these lights in June for a Wedding gift and they worked great! They would stay on almost all night long for about two months. However, now they go out within an hour after being on? These lights look pretty, but don't light-up but for only an hour or so."
2,Disappointing for such a great author,Cameron Mckay kidnaps Meredith from the priory where she has been hiding after being raped by her uncle. He wants only one thing to force her to provide him with an heir and thus end the feud between their families. The character developement was not development enough. I thought the rape by her uncle totally unnecessary. One to skip. I hope Samantha James does much better next time.
5,Wicked But Amazing,"Meredith and Cameron {sigh}...what can I say? In a story that starts out on very shaky ground, the chemistry and relationship betwen the characters is equal to none. There's fire! There's poignancy! You'll be angry one minute and crying the next and I'm not just talking about the female lead in the book. Cameron has alot of unfortunate tragedy to overcome which at multiple times made me want to reach into the pages of the story and hug him. Luckily, Meredith is there for him...after a little urging of her own. This is a book I'll read again...and again! I hope you enjoy it too."
2,"Sloppily-done, and obviously thrown together.","The Kenosha Public Museum is selling these books and has a list of 24 major text mistakes that is available on request from the Museum Gift Shop. I was told that they will mail a copy to those who call the Museum at (262) 653-4140 or visit or make a mail request to the Museum at 5500 First Avenue, Kenosha WI 53140.There is of course value in the photographs shown, but make sure to get a list of all the errors in the photo captions before you get into an argument with someone who did buy the book and insists that what is printed there is Gospel.It's a pity but a sad fact that some 'historians' and editors don't check their research before sending it on to the printers."
4,Breaking the Silence - Koner sounds GREAT on MP3 !,"Thomas Koner is a respected artist who hasproduced several excellent CDs featuringhis unique brand of ambient music. As onewho hunts his music will see, much of hisprevious work is VERY expensive. What to do?I had waited years - hoping in vain that he'dreissue his perpetually out-of-print material,(rather than paying the ridiculously high priceshis catalogue commands). The upshot is that Ibroke down and subscribed to an MP3 site that hasvirtually all of his released albums. I paid a fewdollars for all of it and I'm not sorry I did it - thequality of the MP3s is great!IMHO, Koner should simply reissue his musicrather (and get paid for it), rather than play upto this cult-of-personality nonsense.Its long overdue."
4,"Good, sturdy product - a little awkward to assemble","I needed a third hand to put this together. In addition, I wasn't sure how to secure it, as no other parts came with it. However, it is a heavily built product. That alone makes it a little inflexible, but I like it that way."
3,Nice but pricey,I liked this item. Its very durable and seals bottles well. I think its a bit expensive though so I am not sure if I would buy it again.
4,Treadmill Jocks are hot,"What an amazing concept. Years ago, some studio made some naked workout videos, but it was either lifting weights or doing Yoga.What a clever concept to have the naked male models stand up and work out!Great looking guys as well."
4,Better than the others,"This is the best introductory book on Direct 3D Retained Mode that I have seen (I hear that ""The Awesome Power of Direct3D/DirectX"" is supposed to be quite good, alas it not released as of this date).This book is written for experienced (professional?) programmers, not delusional newbie Java folks who think they are going to teach themselves how to code Quake. It uses MFC for message mapping ONLY. (It does _NOT_ use doc/view like another reviewer said!)My biggest peeve is that Stan Trujillo does not use any sort of Hungarian notation (not even 'p' for pointer or 'm_' for member) - many times I had to search for the definitions of variables that seemingly ""popped"" into the code from nowhere. Also, he doesn't use capitals in variables - like German or somehting (e.g. ""nummorphverticies"").But all in all, this book spoke to me man. I liked it. Everything that was covered was covered well- Morphing and Animation in particular. Thanks to Stan, I'm now happily coding away"
3,"Good book, but only recover Retained Mode","This is good book, well written and with good examples. If you want to learn about Direct 3D Retained Mode, this is the best book. The poor side is the book doesn't recover Direct 3D Immediate Mode. Only few people are using D3D RM to create professional applications, all are using D3D Immediate Mode. If only i could find book that recover D3D IM like this book.. I would give 5 stars !!"
5,Perfect replacement,"I ordered this battery hoping it would fit and work in my JVC camcorder. I recieved it ahead of estimated date, it looks identical, fit perfectly and most important, it holds a charge. My old battery would only work for about 5 mins. Now I'm back to about an hour. Great buy and works perfectly for an non-OEM battery. I recommend this product."
1,Do not hold charge for long,"I guess you get what you pay for. After charging the batteries they lose their charge after a week, even without use."
2,Puh-lease,This battery is a joke. It lasted about 1 hour of non-continuous use. I have charged and discharged but still doesn't hold a charge for an extended period. All I ask is for a battery to last 2-3 hours and I would be happy. Geesh!
5,Product Comes as Described,"Product Comes as Described. Excellent Customer Service. Highly Recomended!These reveiw for High Capacity JVC BN-VF707, BN-VF707U, BN-VF707US, LY34647-002B Premium Quality Equivalent Lithium Ion Camcorder Battery."
5,I KNOW HORSES AND MYSTERIES ! LAURA CRUM HAS ME HOOKED!!!!,"Laura has brought together two passions, mystery and equines and has done it well!! Her stories are original and beliveable. She knows of what she speaks!! I hope to see much more from this young lady, and hope more lovers of horses and mystery get a chance to enjoy her very entertaining yarns. I'm diffinitly a fan for life."
4,Laura and Gail are back at it again.,"Typical Laura Crum novel but that is a good thing. Laura does not produce literary masterpieces but they are intertaining and full of horse information and knowledge. Her books are a find and great reading for horse enthusiasts. You roll those clues around in your head as she does trying to tie them together to solve the murder. I will continue to read and enjoy Ms. Crums ""horsey mysteries""."
3,its okay not too bad not great,"I am horse crazy and adore mysteries. I was excited when friends recommended Laura Crum. Her equestrian knowledge is accurate, the mystery interesting but I found the book lacked depth and the main character not so loveable maybe just underdeveloped. I would try another one of her books if I got low on things to read I would love for them to be good this story has potential."
1,Author should have read the canon material.,"This is well known to be one of the worst Shadowrun novels written to date. There are a lot of side stories that are never explained, the introduction character has absolutely nothing to do with the story later on. In many cases he simply ignored what has been written about Shadowrun but in the novels and in the role-playing game. Part of his introduction hook was to give pity to a dwarf that used to be human but goblinized. In the canon material for Shadowrun that didn't happen to dwarves and elves, only to trolls and orks. The ending of the book just feels completely wrong as well. More or less everybody loses but they all seem content with that. Only reason I'd suggest reading this is to see what not to do."
5,Shadowrun book,I have orderd a LOT of shadowrun books and this one was in the best condition not only was the condtion of the book awesome it was deliverd in a plastic protectve sleeve all around awesome servicei wish this seller sold all the shadowrun books
3,Seiko SNA481,"Nice watch, but I returned it because the stem sticks out so far that it hurts the back of my wrist, and will pull out disconnecting the watch occasionally when I reach inside my pants pocket for change. The Watch Spot exchanged it for a SNJ007 which I am very happy with."
4,Excellent Resource,"I bought this for my 10 year old who is doing a report on Galileo for school. His report needs to include a written report and 5 other elements such as experiments, maps, timelines etc. This book was a great resource with many ideas for projects to do related to Galileo and his life. My only complaint would be the written text on his life was a bit complex for his reading and writing for his report, a great resource for teachers to teach about Galileo. And many awesome fun experiments and project ideas."
5,Galileo for Kids (book),"This book contains a great amount of useful information about Galileo and his times, with interesting practical applications that kids can relate to, and info that is brought into perspective with nicely presented timelines. This book can be enjoyed by any age, and is certainly useful for studying science, astronomy, inventors, or any other general educational use, including biographies."
4,good deal,"i bought this set because it costs as much as one or two sds-plus bits at a big box. i havent used them all, but the ones i have used did what they were supposed to, and they're still doing it. i figured that at this price they might not be the best quality, and maybe they're not, but they work fine. i dont need to drill in rock too often, but when i do these bits are up to it. they'll get dull eventually, but i've had my moneys worth."
2,"OK For the Money, But Not Great - Get Real Bosch!","I bought this bit and chisel set for a small job in old concrete. They work, but after just ~10 hours of work the chisels are rounded at the corners and the spike tip is fairly dull. Bits have similar wear characteristics. If you just want a variety of bits/chisels to do a modest job, go for it. But if you're a pro contractor like me and need something that will take a pounding for years, get genuine Bosch SDS-Plus bits and parts. No, I'm not a Bosch rep putting up a phantom review - just a real-world source of info from a real gig."
2,Missing chisels,Item arrived missing the two smallest chisels. I like to get what was promised and what I paid for. Low quality items which is no surprise since they are made in China. The nice part is the wooden storage box with the foam sheet glued into the lid.
2,Not a new translation ....,"As far as I can tell, this is not a new translation of ""La fortune des Rougons."" There are superficial changes -- much of the first chapter, for example, seems to be newly translated, and the book throughout uses ""Parc"" instead of ""Aire"" when describing the St-Mettre field -- but mostly this is just the same old 19th century Vizetelly translation word-for-word. And Vizetelly wrote that he altered one out of every three sentences! The Emile Zola Society is advertising these new books as newly translated, but this is very misleading in the extreme. A new English translation of this book is desperately needed and way overdue. And the Emile Zola Socity should be on the forefront of making that happen. But alas! What a disappointment!"
1,Recycled Victorian Translation,"I was pleased and excited to learn that the ""Emile Zola Society"" was planning a series of new translations, in a uniform edition, of the entire Rougon-Macquart cycle. Such a project is long overdue: two of the twenty novels in the cycle, including this one, have not been translated since the nineteenth century; and the modern translation of His Excellency, published by Elek in the 1960's, is very hard to find.Anticipation changed to crashing disappointment when I examined The Fortune of the Rougons. As reviewer UncleCliffy correctly notes, this is essentially the nineteenth century Vizetelly translation. If you have been unlucky enough to buy it, just check your copy against the Vizetelly rendering, which is readily available on the net. I don't know who ""translator"" Robert Smith is, but he has a lot of explaining to do. And so does The Emile Zola Society. This kind of marketing is just not acceptable."
1,Burn the damn thing.,"3.0 was a breath of fresh air into the D&D genre. A new system with new rules that kept most of the flavor of the 2nd edition of the game. 3.5 can be summed up in one sentence: Some idiot out-there's houserules for actual D&D.Traps meant for 9th level characters that require a ""wish"" spell to repair, idiotic table for random treasure that do not include weapons for small character, metamagic rods that render characters beyond powerful. Pathetic. My only fear is that a new generation of gamers pick this piece of garbage up and begin to think it's D&D."
4,Just a warning,"Just a warning to all of you thinking of buying Wizards' products from Amazon -- I ordered this book thinking I'd be getting a brand new copy, but I was sent a first printing which had undoubtedly been lying around on a shelf in Amazon's warehouse for the past three years (seeing as it was first printed in 2003).Not that it would have made much difference if they'd sent me the latest print copy -- If you want all but the very latest 'errata' corrections to be incorporated into the text, you have to buy the Special Edition DMG for twice the price of this one. You do get a fancy faux leather cover, page edges spray-painted with silver paint, and a nice blue bookmark though ...Anyway, I just wanted to warn people that you might not get a 'new' copy when you order it 'new' from Amazon."
5,Better than expected,"Based on the description of these used books, I was quite pleased to find that they were all but brand new."
5,Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II,Just the right book for my grandsons. They were delighted to get it and know more of the content of it than I do. Thank you for your services.
5,D&D DMG,"This book is great. I found it an improvement over the 3.5 rules, though I did think they nerfed some things a bit too much."
2,POSTING INTENDED FOR DMG 2 NOT CORE RULE BOOK DMG,"Sorry readers of reviews. This review was meant to be attached to DMG 2, not the core rulebook DMG, which is an excellent work. Sorry for the confusion.Dissapointing is an understatement. There is not a bit of information in this book that would not have been better placed in Dragon magazine. It's useful to some extent, but most players view hardback books as ""cannon"" and softback as ""suggestion"" - and everything in this book is in the catagory of suggestion. No DM should be held to anything in the DMG-2. You can agree to adopt some of it's good ideas if you want to, but this is not golden enough to justify the price tag. If you want it, get it used, and don't spend more than $10."
4,Good Book!!,"Let me start off by saying that this is a great D&D book, and recently I decided to order it from amazon. Now I know amazon is not responsible for third party sellers BUT, I made the mistake of ordering it from megachoices.com. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT order anything from megachoices.com. It took me 20 days to get my books (also ordered the monster manual from them). Please if your going to order anything from Amazon.com; Then order it from them directly. Do not fall into the schemes of third party sellers as I have. Now for the book! What can I say that hasn't already been said. Its a great book! And remember to order it from amazon. You'll find that it is cheaper just to spend the extra bucks and get the books when you need them."
1,3.5 edition! Is this supposed to be software?,Another money making scheme dreamed up by the marketing department. This is not how D&D is supposed to be played;
1,Stay Away,"You can still find copies of the original AD&D; rules. Find them and play the game it was meant to be played.d20 is awkward, ugly and patently unfun.Avoid this version at all costs and use a system where roleplaying is key, not superhuman feats."
4,D&D Dungeon Master's Guide V3.5,"The majority of this book is geared towards the GM who wishes to write their own adventures. However, even if you only plan to run pregenerated modules this book is definitely a must have for any D&D V3.5 GM. It has great advice on how to customize any adventure and is full of useful charts and examples. Along with extra rules and information not covered in the Player's Handbook."
4,as described,I still have this unit in the package so haven't affixed it to anything at this time. I'm sure it's tip top.
1,Poor quality,Poor quality control. The hanguard has four holes which were dirlled over one another leaving two sharp edges. The clip that came with the hanguard broke immediately upon installation. For the price I kept it but don't waste your money. I gave this product one star because it shipped quickly.
4,looks good,its a little on the small side but no 2 sks rifles were quite the same the tension clip provided made it fit acceptably well
3,SKS Ventilated Hand guard,"Ok, first off it only works with on original gas tube. Next,if i had known i would not have ordered it.I am currently using Tapcos gas tube its bigger than the original.(SKS YUGO 59/66) Now after saying that i did go and swap out the wood for steel.It looks great, but not the best fit. It will move if bumped but that is not a big deal. I was going to use the steel hand guard under the UTG SOCOM TRI RAIL hand guard for looks. So for me to stay in compliance on this build i am forced to use tapcos gas tube."
1,SUPER SMALL. DOES NOT FIT MY BRAS!,"I read all these great reviews about this laundry bag being perfect for bras. I just bought some very expensive bras, and was excited about the bag. I knew the description said small bag, but i cant even fit ONE of my bras in there! They won't accept a return either. Never again."
2,BE FOREWARNED,"Last year, before my senior year started, I asked my mom to buy me a study guide to ""prep"" for AP US Government. Unfortunately, she got this one - and I was very disappointed with it. If you are looking for an in-depth review of various topics - as I was last year - this book is definitely not for you. If you are the type of person who needs a last minute study guide before the test this book is for you; it does have important study points. In my estimation, although they themselves aren't that great, it is best to stick with Barron's AP books."
4,Just what my daughter wanted.,"I bought this Oddish plush a couple of years ago for my daughter's birthday. This was the only place I could locate this item. And, my daughter screamed with delight when she saw it. Still sits on her shelf today with her other Pokemon plushes."
5,Please someone publish this book again!!!,"I loved this book so much as a young child, but it finally fell apart from being read and loved too much. Now that I have a daughter of my own, I would love for her to enjoy it as much, but $150 for a used copy is realistic for a young child... Please Harpers, publish this wonderful book again, so the next generation of readers can have a chance to experience the wonderful stories, poems and drawings."
4,Thick padding.,"I LOVE the thick padding. I wish I bought once size smaller since these did run a bit large. The spandex material seems a bit thinner then my Adidas brand shorts. The quality of the stitching leads me to believe that this product will last, I've only worn them a few times, so I will have to see."
5,Awesome Shorts,"I really like these shorts the padding is comfortable, and the fit really well. I also love the fact that they are made in The USA. I wash them after every use and they are holding up great I called Aero Tech about a different order and their customer service was wonderful to deal with. I ride about 100 miles per week on average and would recommend these if youre going to spend a lot of time in the saddle!"
5,Made in the USA,I purchased these shorts primarily because they were made in the USA and secondarily because of the price. The quality was about the same as the imported shorts I usually purchase. The fit was good and the insert (made in Italy) makes for a comfortable ride.
2,"Too thick, too itchy","Unfortunately fabric that was used to sew these pants isn't too good. The pants are too thick, too itchy and as such too hot."
5,Great for the big man!,"Ok, so everyone thinks that anyone who rides a bike is small and thin. Well for those of us who are on the ""big"" side we too like to ride bikes and lose fat while enjoying the sport, but it's hard to find biking pants that are padded in all the right places for us too. Well gentlemen, here is the answer. I have bought 3 pairs from this company and they fit well, are well made and are padded in all of the right places! I highly recommend this company and their product. I don't believe you will regret the shorts or the fit."
1,shorts are painful,"the top shelf mens cycling shorts do not provide enough coverage in the padding to protect the sit bone area. the sewn in pad is much too small..there is no way your sit bones can be centered on the pad without having to move forward in the shorts which is impossible...there is absolutely no room in the tight fitting crotch area to allow you to center yourself onto the pad.After all it is a one size fits all pad i was told and to me that tells the whole story...well made product...very good customer service...but poor-(flawed)design gets this a 1 star rating...these may fit an adolescent..but not a 5'9"" 180lb male."
2,perspective,"The author gives an important perspective on chronic, undiagnosed pain. As in _Vinegar Hill_ , her knowledge of Catholism is incorrect."
1,this is just not Aaron Neville as you want to hear him,"very disappointed in this CD, You can't beat the Grand Tour but Greatest hits is a big miss!!"
4,I really like it,This book is full of practical ideas for Simplifying your life. You're only supposed to read one section per day but it was hard not to get ahead.
3,Too much good stuff missing,"There is a much better greatest hits album available for a budget price. Admittedly, at a super low price, this would seem like a bargain but the ten songs selected include some that should be left off in favor of three big hits which are not included. Missing are ""Hooray for Hazel,"" ""Heather Honey,"" and ""Jam Up and Jelly Tight.""The cd does include three of my favorites. ""Sheila,"" which is remenicent of Buddy Holly, was Tommy's first hit in 1962 and with a driving drum beat and use of the classic E, A, D chords, is similar to Holly's ""Peggy Sue."" His megahit ""Dizzy"" is also included and is part of any essential Tommy Roe collection. Dizzy is a classic bubble gum track as is another favorite on this cd, ""Sweet Pea."" Unfortunately, too much that is worth little is on this collection at the expense of some really good stuff. I highly recommend a good Tommy Roe collection but this is not the one."
2,Ka-BOOM!,"I love this little espresso maker, BUT, mine didn't come with the stainless plate inside. For some reason it brewed up a bout five cups perfect, then it started hissing when the coffee grounds blocked the percolating shaft. I went to check on it and it exploded, shooting coffee grounds 15 feet away and 8 feet high on the wall. It covered about 200 square feet with grounds. I'm very lucky the lid was open away from me or I'd have been badly scalded in the face. I'm sure if I had the part, it would work ok, I bought it at TJ Maxx. When I called Bodum, they said they havent sold this model for 5 years and had no parts to it. Be careful if you buy this."
3,espresso?,"gee, this seems more like a coffee maker than an espresso maker: the holes in the metal filter hardly seem small enough for espresso grind, and the water capacity (two cups) seems appropriate for coffee rather than espresso.It works OK. you need to pay attention when it's done, because it cools quickly. It's quick and easy, and fairly convenient, especially when you find that extra wind of cord under the base. Is it worth the price? no. I got mine for $50 and think I paid $25 too much."
1,Breaks easily,"Makes average coffee. Also the stem inside the upper clear plastic part broke on mine. And its not covered under warranty because the warranty only covers electrical faults, and they wont even sell the upper clear part as a separate replacement part. My only option is to buy a whole new machine, which is definitely not going to happen."
1,So junky,"I was able to brew one pot with this thing. The second time I went to use it, it seemed like the heating element was burned out. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this."
1,Out-dated the moment it was released,"You know you're premise is in trouble when an example you use proves exactly the opposite to what you are arguing. The authors argue against Apple's approach which favoured a highly loyal set of customers, calling it a ""strategic blunder"" as compared to Microsoft, who the authors call the ""dominant player in this market"". Apple's ""blunder"" has now turned it into a company that makes more money, is worth more in market capitalization, is worth more in brand value, is constantly more innovative, and spans completely different markets - all built on the idea that you build on a core base of loyal customers, rather than trying to get every customer you can find."
2,Missed the mark,"Interesting reading. I enjoyed the content but this is not what you want to base a campaign or business plan on. I get the impression it was written by people who have never had a real day-in-day-out job. For example, the myth about the cost of obtaining new customers--way over simplified and wrong in many places.In short, a lot of fluff no substance."
5,Fun and insightful book,"I should preface this by saying that I have no experience in customer loyalty and read the book on the recommendation of a friend as a ""fun read"". It is indeed that, and provides many interesting anecdotes from the industry. The book is well written and is primarily an enumeration of errors in statistical inference common to the industry. The author cogently discusses these, elucidating his points with historical cases and numerical examples. The book has a light-hearted style, but maintains focus on the underlying thesis. The author supplements the cautionary aspect of the work with positive suggestions to guide his reader in future analyses."
4,Something Business Owners Should Read,"The book's title overstates its case to a degree. But, it still is a book one should read before undertaking a customer loyalty initiative. It's suicidal unless you've done some rigorous customer profitability analysis first. If you don't have the data to do it, shame on you and figure out how to get the data you need first. The last chapter in the book has a wonderful project plan to follow to get things done. The basic premise of the book is that since usually more than 80% of your customers lose money for the firm when their activity is analyzed, you must be careful in enhancing loyalty. Otherwise, you're not following the old axiom, ""When you find yourself in a hold, quit digging."" The book also harpoons the logical and factual fallacies in many bromides that underly the customer loyalty industry."
4,Loyalty Myths: Hyped Strategies that will put you out of business and proven tactics that really work,"Generally a good book, easy to read with good examples. Well footnoted, although is seems most of their research came from Harvard Business Review. It really helps to put into prospective a lot of the Loyalty stuff you now hear. Its a pretty quick read, I would recomend it if your need something for a long drive or flight."
1,Titillation only - no real substance,"The pictures in the book have naked men and women in various sex poses - no genitalia are shown.The book's only selling (if at all) proposition is the photos..you can ignore the text. The author gives advice that even a teenager knows in our country!BTW, I picked it up at my local public library - jst before I picked it up, about three middle-school girls turned the pages over and replaced the book on the shelf looking intensely bored."
5,LOVE POP PHYSIQUE,It's about time someone makes a fitness DVD targeted for my butt! It's my biggest trouble spot and this workout really makes me feel like my butt will soon look the way I always wanted it to. Love Cardio Butt School! Can't get enough of it!!!!
4,Just purchased and it looks great!,"My only reservation so far is ALL the copying of forms to make the book more re-useable (btw this is suggested in the book). Be sure and turn up the darkness setting on the copier, because the pages are printed in very light colors.OK, so what about the rest of the book? It looks fantastic. It encourages the reader to carefully consider all the steps of a home improvement project. So far it has really made me focus on the important issues of cost and scheduling.Worth the money? I say yes!"
5,Porch building,I was building a porch and needed information on it. This book is greatat getting you started. Most books are about building decks. Porchesare a little bit different. Also go to [...] for used books onporches. New books on porch building are very hard to find now a days.This book will definately help.
1,Not Happy At All,"I had to give it a star just to be able to write my negitive review.I printed 25 and the cartridge quit working and the same thing happened with the 2nd cartridge. Now keep in mind each cartridge is supposed to print 100 photo's. I was so upset about the whole thing, I just went and bought a new cammera and printer...... So no I do not encourage any one to purchase this item.I do not give it a star....I give it a never...."
4,Short summary of Magna Carta makes easy reading,"The author, A.E.Dick Howard, a well-known scholar on Magna Carta has managed to pack in a few pages a highly readable synopsis of all provisions of the Great Charter that King John granted to the barons, sword in hand, in June 1215.This Charter has great importance in its foreshadowing American constitutional provisions on such fundamental rights as freedom of our religious institutions from governmental interference, right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances, right of temporary insurrection to restore the Constitution in case of tyranny (chapter 61 of the Charter, Second Amendment to the US Constitution), due process of law, speedy trial by jury, fair trials, proportionate punishment (ban on cruel and unusual punishments).Summarizing: this short work is an excellent, highly readable authoritative introduction to the Great Charter."
2,Spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere,"While this urn makes a great cup of coffee the reliability of the three i have bought have been extremely dissapointing. One out of the box was a dude. The second one lasted about two months then died. The last one had several leak problems like others have reported along with a timer that was WAY off target. It was supposed to have a three phase color scheme where it turned one of the three leds from green to red for every two hours it was left on. (freshness indicator) They all went from green to red in about 1.5 hours. Not a big deal for me but, maybe for someone else. I WILL NOT buy another. The only reason i put two stars was the fact it made a nice cup of coffe and it stayed hot. Reliability....not so much. Good luck!"
5,Buddha's Teachings Every Buddhist Should Read,"This is one of the main Discourses for students who are keen to take their Diploma, Ba, Ma & PhD in Buddhism studies :) Yet another strongly recommended book to purchase"
3,Translations,"The problem is, with translations of the Nikayas and most of the Pali Canon is that translations are scarce, and therefore choosing between a reliable and non-reliable translation is sometimes difficult. Many scholars debate over correct Pali translations and there are some terms which have been unsetteled for a long time, ever since the inception of the Pali Text Society. Unfortuantly, this is one of the translations that contains a few errors here and there, as well as misleading footnotes. Learning Pali and Sanskrit is not an option for all of us, so sometimes, these will suffice.Another interesting note is that the Nikayas are not really Theravada only (as is the Pali Canon), but these are some of the most fundamental texts of Buddhism dating back to the first Buddhist council, only a few years after the death of the Buddha."
1,Never received it.,"I waited and waited for this item. One email said it was sent, another said it was canceled and after that, another email said I should have received it by now. Finally after a long time, I received an email saying it was out of stock. I am very confused with all the different emails. I was very disappointed in this company."
4,convienent!,"i'm an american expatriate living in s.korea. we initially bought this b/c we'd be traveling back and forth so much. plus, high chairs (decent ones) are twice as much in this country. it's a great chair that hooks up easily and disassembles just was easily. my daughter doesn't mind sitting it since it gives her a good view of what's going on around her. it's also easy clean. the only thing i don't like too much is the fact that it doesn't seat her right up to the edge of the table, so if she drops something, down it goes. make sure your child can support his/her head well, and can sit up. i put my daughter in it even when she couldn't sit up by herself; the straps hold her in just fine. overall and very good investment for people that travel, are on the go a lot, or don't have much space for a high chair."
2,Director Must Love the Conductor,"I was greatly disappointed in this DVD. It has great Wagner selections, well played and recorded. The thing that almost drove me out of my mind was the director's constant focus on the conductor, Klaus Tennstedt, mostly ignoring the orchestra and its soloists. The pleasure of watching music played on DVD is next best to being at an actual performance, where you scan the orchestra while listening. This DVD robs you of that. You might just as well listen to a CD. I gave it away to a friend who is more tolerant than I."
5,Thought Provoking!!!,"I used this work as the text for a class I took in college last semester. I have reread it 3 times since. As an english literature major, I enjoyed his unique combination of strong language, facts and other articles in order to state his case. I recommend this to anyone of any faith, or lack of faith as a way to rediscover the true meaning in their relationship with a higher power."
4,"A fun, lighthearted show","This is a fun little show, though lacking a bit in depth. There is a villain, but things are never really resolved with him I felt. That aside, it's a great show to watch an episode or two and enjoy on a rainy day. The characters are all fun (except for the villains, but they're suitably villainous), the adventures are entertaining, and the narrator is hilarious!Pick this one up if you're looking for a more lighthearted anime with likable characters and some decent laughs."
2,Bad Narrator,"The narrator keeps talking when the characters are talking, making two subtitles, and two verbal discussions that all compete with each other. The story itself is standard anime"
5,really nice,"Came with the series in both DVD and Bluray formats, came in a very nice and beautiful/durable box. Series was very adorable and enjoyable, some people say the ending was lame, but that's some straight up bull. 9.6/10 would recommend"
2,Someone PLEASE Shut The Narrator Up!!,"The obnoxious loud British fantasy voice sounding narrator makes this anime basically unwatchable. Every time I started getting into the story she'd make some asinine comment about the female character's lack of breasts or something equally pointless. She's constantly undermining the story and making fun of the characters. If they were going for funny it just came off as annoying. It's like going to a movie and having to sit next to someone who talks really loud and has to keep up a running commentary the whole time. I was going to rate this 1 star but I gave it 2 because I felt the rest of the anime had promise, however I couldn't finish it because the narrator got so annoying. I would recommend previewing at least the first episode on youtube or Funimation's website BEFORE buying this to see if you like it."
5,Against the grain,"You know what? I placed this anime on the bottom rung on my want list because of reading the reviews. Sometimes they can help, other times they can hurt ya. This was one of the few times they did not help me.The reason being was the whole narrator comments about how annoying it was having the speaker talking over the characters. That right away sounded like something I would not like and would ruin the anime watching experience for me.So after a time, I finally ended up getting this series. Turns out, imo, I find that I LIKE the narrator's witty banter during the story. I think it works how they added it in. And after that the actual story, character voices, and everything else made this a fun series for me to watch. I happily give this series 5 stars because it seemed to me that as soon as I started it, it was over. :)"
5,Fairytale innuendos. . .with a twist,"So, fairy God-mother is telling the story of little red riding hood and the big bad wolf. . .well, the bad wolf is the heroine and is a member of this club that helps people. However, she has a protector that admits his love for her. She doesn't know how to handle it. There are some dark themes, but for the most part an enjoyable anime through and through. I especially liked the big bad wolf's boxing gloves during street fights. They make mewing noises everytime she hits someone. . ."
1,Narrator killed it for me!,"I didn't know this show had a narrator when I bought it, and having a narrator talking and interrupting during the entire series just ruined the show for me. It's a women who talks in a fairy tale like voice and even talks when the characters are speaking. Did nothing but piss me off. I would have probably rated this 4 stars if there was no narrator. If you don't mind someone else speaking their mind go for it, if not you should watch it on youtube first."
4,Free at Last,"Liberation, by C. Smith-Rea is a collection of four short stories. The men and women in each story must find the courage to leave their comfort zones and enter into a realm which promises to challenge them to become better, stronger, and wiser. Ultimately, they find the strength to travel on paths unknown and grasp what we all desire but are often too afraid to work towards achieving--true liberation.From the grandmother that refused to raise anymore babies, to the wife that gained the courage to walk out on her unfaithful husband after twenty-five years of marriage--every story was heartfelt and thought-provoking. Smith-Rea captured the essence of her characters and dropped the reader smack dead in the center of the drama. This book is definitely a must read for short-story lovers!T.

3,BCBG CUstard,Returned this item. Color not as pictured but a bit darker. Not a bad shoe but too busy for me.
4,beatiful!,"These are so pretty!! The size was a bit bigger than my feet, but they didn't have any smaller sizes so I'm sticking with the 6, plus I have wide feet so I don't want to take a chance with a 5.5 in case I don't fit it, so I'm going to put something in the back heel area so they'll fit better. But they are beautiful! I wish they had the rest of the colors in my size! =("
4,Very pleased,"Almost didn't buy online, some things are just too hard to judge from a few photos. But I bought this anyway and I am very pleased with this set. The pieces have good weight, feel very solid and have a comfortable shape. They have a good shine and are very attractive in their simplicity. The drawer organizer that came with it is also of good quality and happened to be a perfect fit in my kitchen drawer."
3,"Not sure about the ""0"".","Having a Reed & Barton set of flatware for 10 years or so already, I was all set to give this flatware a 5-star rating. For three reasons I didn't..........First, I thought the 18/0 was a typo for 18/10. I don't think it was, although this was not readily apparent. There is a difference, and it was hard for me to learn what it was. As I understand, the shine won't hold up as well over time. Second, the weight of each piece is less than what I expected it to be. That's a minus in my book. Finally, I don't think there were any extra teaspoons. (I'm not certain because this was a gift and each piece was individually wrapped. As I recall, it said on the box there were only twelve teaspoons.) All in all, though, it's still Reed & Barton and I got it at a pretty good price, so I'm happy with the flatware. Time will tell..............."
2,"Songs are great classics, sound quality was very poor","My title for my review pretty much says it all. I love Gladys Knight's singing and the songs; however, the quality of the sound was very poor. The first three songs seem to be recorded on low and when I raise the volume, you hear background noise and static. I tried to play it in two different places and it was the same scenario of poor sound quality. I would not recommend this CD."
4,20011 chevy Corbalt,"This hitch was my secound Curt hitch.First one was for a 2006 Chevy hhr. Very eazy to install.The other hitch was for my 20011 Chevy Corbalt.Not as eazy to installas the hhr hitch but If I knew what know now this hitch would also be very eazy to install.I removed the trunh pan cover, spare tire & set the battery back away from where I would be drilling.The rear dam was held by rubber/plactic fasteners, these & trime off so the the dam would come off.Next I centered the hitch to the the bumper beam.When I moved the hitch position then I could not see where I had marked the center so, I then used the liesence holder center as a reference. This worked ok.It was hard to drill the 4 upper bolt holes as this beam is made of two thicknesses. A step drill might work good.The bolts drop down from the top & I taped them on to the spacers as it is hard to reach these bolts with your fingers. I plan to use some sealer on the inside of the trunk & bolts & washers where I removed the dam."
3,One size does not fit all,This hat has elastic in head band and It was still too large for myself. Gave it to some one with a big head.callharve
2,"Spectacular Game, Horrible Bonus Features","Awesome game with a nail-biting finale. The bonus features really left a lot to be desired. I was expecting things such as ""Texas vs. Oklahoma Condensed Game Highlights"", ""Texas vs. Oklahoma State Condensed Game Highlights"", ""Post/Pre-Heisman Interview with Colt McCoy"", clips of the team prepping for the Fiesta Bowl, and an interview with Mack Brown. The 2006 Rose Bowl (when Texas won the National Championship) had really great bonus features similar to what I mentioned. I had the chance to buy just the iTunes download of this which would've been much cheaper, but bought the DVD because I've been used to good bonus features that can't be found elsewhere.My advice - if you're looking for a copy of the game, just get the itunes download and save your money...you won't get much more with the DVD."
1,2009 Fiesta Bowl DVd,The DVD that I bought did not playback correctly. The playback was fragmented and MovieMars made me print out a return form and also they made me ship it back to them. They should have just sent me another copy. I have mailed the DVD back and I am waiting to hear back from them. At this time I am disappointed with MovieMars.
5,Don't lose the opportunity buy the book.Book in excellent condition and low price. It's new.,If you need information about the European Frame for languages don't hesitate to buy the book.
1,Lighting Out for the Territory,"I ordered too quickly, apparently, and didn't check author, etc. I didn't want this book, but the newer one by the same title by Morris."
5,Useful information,This guide is chock full of useful information for anyone looking to begin a career as a makeup artist.
3,Not Necessary,"This book has some okay information. Its a good book if you dont have any prior makeup knowledge. Honestly, i felt like a good internet search would pull up the exact same info- FOR FREE. Im just sayin, theres nothing in this book that is crucial or that you wont find through good common sense"
2,A healthy side of pseudo science with your massage,"This book is fine if you confine your reading to the chapters on Swedish massage. Most of the other sections are loaded with silliness, including admonitions not to practice certain massage techniques during eclipses or earthquakes. These other techniques are discussed in such a vague, airy manner that I honestly don't know how someone would evaluate whether they had learned them properly or not."
3,Interesting but slow paced,When i bought this video i thought it would be completely highlights.It is an instructional video with highlights of Dr.J's greatness.He teaches you all the fundamental of playing. A great movie if your looking for instructional because it guides you through the moves with his highlights.
5,"Wow, simply speechless.","Wow.One word sums it all up. This book is brilliant.Buy it, buy it now!!!I can't wait to see the next book Farley pumps out. I'd pre-order it now if I could.Stop browsing through other books, just buy this one. You won't regret it!"
5,Great glass - and works with my shaker!,"Perfect size to replace clear glass in my old aluminum shaker - and measurements makes complicated martinis really easy. A bit cluttered with so much information, but quite useful and interesting looking. Certainly an attention getter."
4,one of the strongest business books in years!,"This is one of those books that I'd give to every client and every person I work with, particularly as a white guy. Coming from the tech world and dealing with a lot of straight-laced by-the-books protocol-driven people, I was amazed by the amount of insights this book gave me. I actually related to a ton of stuff in this book about the office pimps and hustlers--people who just manipulate and treat colleagues like disposable capital to be used and abused... Some of the rap lyrics were a bit much for my tastes, but I understand what he was going for, and for people who listen to that music, I'm sure that stuff resonates a little better. But his breathe of knowledge and reference points is pretty stunning, particulary given his upbringing. This would be a great book for anyone climbing the ladder in any industry, especially someone starting out in the business world right out of college. I wish i had this book 7 or 8 years ago."
3,Minor stuff from Simon,"A very late novel from ""New Novel"" hero and Nobel Prize-winner Claude Simon (b. 1913), this is a barely fictionalized account of his trip to Russia in the final days of the Soviet empire. Despite some pointed criticisms of Communism--the author is far from being a ""fellow traveler""--this is definitely second-tier Simon; it lacks the scale of his earlier masterpieces and the prose is less fluid (though here I may simply be missing the able hand of long-time Simon translator Richard Howard). The subject matter is also unfortunate; the novel already feels a little dated, and that certainly cannot be said for ""The Wind,"" which made Simon's reputation back in the late '50s and stands as one of the best French novels of the past fifty years. I can recommend ""The Invitation"" only to interested readers who may want to try out Claude Simon without plunging into his longer (and better) books--this novel is, at least, too short to overstay its welcome."
1,Never learned to Knit!,"I am shocked by the praise for this book. It has awful instructions. The first step on making a slip knot- if you follow the directions it does not produce a slip knot. I learned more from watching YouTube videos...that were free! This was a waste of money for me as a beginner. Perhaps as I learn more I could reference it, but it certainly did not teach me to knit! I almost gave up out of frustration!"
4,Great pics!,"This book is very helpful for the visual learner. I would like a little more written explanation to help, but overall a great book."
1,"Oversimplified, to say the least","I was very disappointed in this book, I was looking forward to learning to knit with this visual aid but I didn't find it to be helpful at all.Sure you could read about yarn but really I wanted more pictures.If you are a beginner move on, you're better off to look up free how to videos online.Two big thumbs down!"
5,Easy instructions,This is one of the best informational books on knitting that I have purchased. The directions are easy to follow and I love all the instructional pictures. I love the adjustable hat patterns that can be sized for children and adults. I liked this book so much I purchsed one as a gift .
5,My Go-To Knitting Guide,"I am totally new to knitting, only been knitting for 1-1/2 months. I was looking for a book to explain all the stitches, patterns and projects easily. This book does it!!! I love how there are actually photographs of every movement and stitch. It is a wonderful reference guide!I originally purchased it for my kindle 2 and I found that it was hard to see with photgraphs. So I returned it and ordered the paper version. If you are looking for a good reference guide for your kindle, I would recommend Knitting for Dummies, Mini Edition.http://www.amazon.com/Knitting-Dummies-Mini-ebook/dp/B004MPRP2K/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&m;=AG56TWVU5XWC2&s;=digital-text&qid;=1297866406&sr;=1-3It is only $[..] and it will be nice to have with me when I am traveling without lugging around regular books."
5,help for the almost hopeless,"I had given up on ever learning to knit until I found this book. I had many hours of frustration and tears under my belt because I could never see clearly and for sufficient time to get the picture in my head of what to do next. This book has very clear color photos with sufficient explanation that even someone who is awkward using their fingers like me can finally learn to knit. I'm definitely a ""visual"" learner in all areas of my life. Finally a craft book for me!My own personal opinion is that the continental style seems quicker once you learn it than the English style, so if you are just starting out go with continental. You will move your hands less to make stitches with the former method hence more stitches per minute. Just be aware that most knitters in the US seem to have learned the English method, so may have fewer people who can help you initially."
4,Teach Yourself Visually Knitting,"I had little or no patience for learning to knit. I have been a wood-worker all my life; but in an effort to bring my wife into deer hunting I agreed to try knitting with her. I knew as much about a knit-purl stitch as my wife knew about dressing a buck. Well, after a few lessons in this guy-friendly book, I knew enough to put down my glue gun and pick up the needles and not let go! So far I have competed a hunting scarf and I am working on another one for one of my buddies. I am proud to say my wife had the same luck this year bagging a deer-- a 7 point whitetail! And yes, she does know the difference between buck and bird shot!A bullseye of a book."
5,Great for novice knitters,I originally got this book at the library and loved it so much I bought it. The pictures are very helpful for a novice like me. Makes me want to try more difficult patterns.
3,Teach Yourself Visually Knitting,"I am just a biginner so even though the pictures are nice, the instructions are difficult to follow. Once someone shows you how to do it it is easier to understand the pictures and the instructions. Perhaps this is not the book for a biginner."
3,"Okay, as long as it's not your only source.","I never knitted before buying this book, so I wanted something that really explained the stitches and techniques. I did not find this book to be enough for that. The pictures look great until you try to practice the stitches, then you realize they're just not clear enough. I found that I was able to supplement the material in the book with the great (and free) video demonstrations on another web site (sorry, I can't put the URL here). Once I saw the stiches being done in the videos, the book was enough of refresher for me. The book also contains a few typos, which is annoying, but I was able to work through it."
2,Not simple enough for this college graduate.,"I already knew how to crochet and I wanted to learn how to knit also, I saw that this book had great reviews but when I bought it I found it was not very helpful at all. It's not organized well and there are alot of assumptions that you already know stuff that they just don't mention how to do. It has not helped me really at all. I gave it two stars because it does have alot of projects and information. It's just not very easy to learn yourself."
4,Teach Yourself Visually Knitting,This is a great reference book. I have referred to it many times already. A downside that I found frustrating was that I could not figure out how to knit and purl in the same row. There should be illustrations and detailed directions about switching the yarn. I finally figured it out myself after becoming extremely frustrated. Everything else that I have needed has been nicely illustrated and explained. I would recommend this book!
5,A great book for beginners,The book is nicely outlined and the pictures are great. It shows both english and continental style. In a matter of no time I was already knitting the more complicated stitches. I also like how it has beginner to intermediate projects. I can see myself always using this book for the variety of stitches patterns it has and as an overall reference. After seeing this book I want to buy the Teach Yourself Visually Crocheting.
3,Great for those who also have a teacher,"This is a great book if you have someone else to ask questions. It's great for those who are visual learners and you'll definitely be able to complete more projects and learn more stitches. However, some of the images can be confusing, which is why it's good to have an expert you can speak to in order to clarify some of the illustrations."
5,Great book,I really like this book as it really helps with learning how to knit. Also it arrived very fast 2 weeks earlier than it should have. Considering I live half the world away ... it was preatty fast. Thank you Amazon!
3,TEACH YOURSELF VISUALLY KNITTING,I WAS HOPEING THIS WOULD OF BEEN A BIT MORE VISUAL ON SOME OF THE STICHES.
3,Definitely Columbo!,"The book successfully makes the jump from tv to novel. If you know Columbo (Peter Falk!) then you'll hear his voice throughout the book. If you don't, this is still a pretty good mystery novel, although, as a mystery per se, it is a little lacking. i.e., the Columbo tie-in makes this work, where it wouldn't really ""click"" on its own. Faint praise? No, because the tv tie-in really is the whole point here, and that part succeeds very well indeed."
1,Unnecessarily Long and Slow Moving,"I could not finish this movie. I knew going in that it was long at two and a half hours, but I got 30 minutes in and nothing had really happened. Cut about 45 minutes out of this and speed it up and bit and it might have been decent."
1,video on demand,17 min is not long enough especialy since there were 3 times in the beginning that buffering occured (I had windows 7 since this July). Toward the end of the 17 minutes the picture format changed to full screen. While changing the picture format back that is the moment the video stoped. For $14.95 the video on demand is very expensive. Buy the the DVD instead.
1,Unmitigated crap,"I despair that so many people think this movie is good. One of the worst movies ever made. A lot of money & time spent jerking people around with cruelty to animals. Shame on you, Spielberg!"
1,Never opened,"I down loaded this so I could watch it on a long air flight home, but it never opened. Never. I was unable to watch it."
1,The star is there for the cinematography,"Beautifully lit and filmed this manipulative film is the worst kind of schlock. It is the Perils of Pauline as imagined by the Marquis de Sade. Not once, not twice, but several times does a character in this film (all different people) put a gun to the head of it's hero and star. Is the star to be killed? We know is isn't true as the trailer has given away the ending - so again and again and again we see the horse taken to the brink of death, only to be given a few minutes reprieve. This is only the tip of the iceberg as to the perils the horse endures. I consider this movie to be abusive. Abusive to the audience. It was possible to tell this story without these cheap manipulations. This will go down as my worst cinema experience ever. Before you accuse me of being cowardly or a sissy - The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and Inglorious Basterds are some of my favorite films. War Horse is not."
3,War Horse,"One viewing is all I could take. It made me realize again the horrible suffering the animals endured through this and all wars and while that is not to be compared to human suffering, I had a hard time sleeping for a few nights after watching it, realizing just how lost and depraved mankind, without God's love in their hearts, can be to all of His creation."
4,Memorable movie,"Every now and then I think of this movie and ponder on the emotional events that surrounded this horse's experiences during the second world war.The sequence of events touched my heart, but the fact that they cover several years took me completely by surprise which leads to a four star review.Great dialogue, drama, and action. It also shows several perceptions of war that are often overlooked. i.e. emotional and physical effect on multiple families, the ""horsemasters,"" battle logistics, and economical effects on land and people."
5,War Horse Movie Review,Impressed with movie overall. Good story-line and ending for a war movie.I would recommend this movie to any movie-goer that enjoys happy endings.
2,Snore Horse,"Think Black Beauty without good character development and throw in a war. Now you know the story of War Horse. The emotional bonding between the main character and the horse was just not believable and at times corny. Most of what happened in this film was very predictable. The whole way through you know how it will all end. Have you ever seen the film where Lassie gets lost, switches owners a few times and ends up in a war? So have the people that made this film."
4,Preordered War Horse,"It was shipped as promised on the release date (Tuesday, April 3rd). I bought it for my mom who's birthday was on April 6th. I figured with three days, it would arrive on time. Unfortunately, it didn't arrive until the following Tuesday. A little disappointed in the shipping time. But the product is great, and the movie is phenomenal."
2,Overhyped slow movie that severely lacked story depth,"I heard many good things about War Horse, it was a Spielberg movie, it deserved film of the year, etc. But I also heard some other opinions, that it wasn't a classic grand Spielberg movie of old. So my expectations were mixed when my family and I set down to watch War Horse.At the half-way point of the movie, we were all feeling a bit let down. The movie was very slow and lacked any depth and excitement it wasn't anything new and unfortunately the story and pace never really picked up for the last half of the movie. In the end, the whole family was left with, so that's it? That was War Horse? There was nothing grand about this movie. The story was one that we have seen before, but they plugged a horse into the role. I was hoping for a lot more out of this film, but it didn't deliver.I won't say it was a horrible movie, but there wasn't anything that pushed it to the great or even very good categories. 4-5 star movie this is definatly not."
2,Not so great....,"I bought this movie because several people I know said it was a very good movie. I was not impressed with it. In my opinion, this is a movie to be rented, not purchased. Secondly, it took several days before amazon shipped my order out (it seems they only ship things out quickly during the Christmas holiday season)."
5,Another Classic,"Great sprawling story with our ""War Horse"" as the centerpiece. Fairly family-friendly with the exception of some (war) violence. Guess you might've guessed that from the title eh?"
4,How lives do sometimes cross again.,Interesting story. The lives that are touched by this horse are many. We never know when our paths will cross again
3,War Horse,"Although the movie was watchable, I found it to be lacking in so many ways. I do not feel that the storyline portrayed the hype around the movie. All in all, it was disapointing."
3,A feel good movie,"I am not a fan of Spielburg movies. I had recently finished a good book on WWI and thought the movie would be fun. I should have read the plot first. This movie was too ""feel good"" for my tastes. It also seemed to need to be shortened some. The ending reminded me of Gone with the Wind. I would skip unless you are a horse person."
2,DISAPPOINTING,I should have rented before I bought. Interesting but just not what I thought it could be. A boy and his horse. HO HUM.
2,DISSAPOINTING MOVIE & QUALITY!,"I WAS VERY EXCITED UPON ARRIVAL BUT AFTER WATCHING VERY DISSAPONTED. THE MOVE COPY DRAGGED WITH STILL MOMENTS AND VERY DARK PICTURE COLOR, HARD TO SEE MOVIE. I RETURNED THE MOVIE TO AMAZON FOR A SWIFT REFUND. I HAVE BOUGHT MANY MOVIES FROM AMAZON & THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I HAD A ISSUE WITH!"
3,Horse Movies,"Good movie, just not a great Horse movie. I can think of others that were much better as a story and movie."
3,Very disapointed.,"I almost bought the DVD. But thankfully they had it on PPV. I watched it. If I were 8 or stoned I would have fully enjoyed it. But is was so full of shtick and formula it was not funny. It was totally unrealistic. No way all that could have happened and if it did that horse would have been dead like 5 times. I love animal movies but this would require me to destroy a bunch of brain cells to enjoy. To the movie producers I say start paying writers, good writers. Special effects and appealing to our love of animals is not enough. Get us a decent damn plot. This could have been so much more. It just was too far out there. I gave it a 3 because the scenes and effects and some of the acting was very good. If I had to grade it on the plot it would be a 1."
3,War Horse Review-Once is enough,Like I said:Once is enough. Not quite what I expected but not terrible. I kind of expected a little more from Stephen Spielberg.
5,WAR HORSE- AMAZING,"BOTTOM LINE - GREAT FILMI DIDN'T SEE IT IN THE THEATERS I WATCHED A COPY IN THE PRIVACY OF MY HOMEFROM THE ACADEMY.LET ME TELL YOU A GREAT FILM, GREAT SCORE AND THE LAST 15 MINUTES I WAS CRYING LIKE A BABYTHE MOVIE WAS GREAT BUY IT THAT'S ALL"
4,Gift,"Came in a timely fashion. It is a gift, so it remains to be seen if the content is pleasing to the giftee..."
2,"""War"" Horse","This film makes for a great drama, but the World War I backdrop is there simply to give a platform for the story. The advertising of this movie as a WWI drama is misleading. The WWI action you see in the trailer is pretty much the entirety of what you'll see in the movie. What war scenes are actually in the film are unrealistic and romanticized. The title of this film would more accurately be ""Horse Which Happens to Be In a War On Occasion""."
2,War Horse,"The online service provided by Amazon was excellent. The movie had potential but seemed to drag in the plot. It seemed more like a made for TV movie, not a true relection of history."
3,I love horses immensely....but,"This movie did not deliver. I thought it had waaay too much war content and not enough of the story telling dynamic between boy and horse.With Steven Spielberg at the helm, it could have been an excellent piece of moving making. Technically, it was excellent. You can see the Spielberg touch; story telling was convoluted and not compelling enough to hold the viewer's attention."
3,War Horse,"My husband went to see war Horse at the movies and it was the best I had seen for some time. Love the storyline, the music and the effects."
3,"Ouch, Painful to Watch!","This movie depicts an excessive amount of cruelty to horses, more than I think was necessary to get the point across. It was tough for me to watch. I didn't enjoy it and I usually do like Spielberg's films. I'll give 3 stars for the parts of the movie sans cruelty.The horse works the farm until he is drafted into military service during the war. During his journey away from home, the horse meets other horses and a variety of people. His bonding experiences with them is actually quite touching. His owner never gives up trying to get him back."
3,What has happened to Spielberg?,"This is the first Spielberg flick that I have seen since ""Letters From Iwo Jima"". What a disappointment. While the film was inoffensive, it was predictable and cliche in the extreme. Also, from a guy that has done such movies as the Iwo Jima movies, ""Band of Brothers"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", etc.: How could he come up with such ridiculously inaccurate war scenes? The calvalry charging through a line of machine guns and not stopping to kill the gunners? Phosgene gas spreading at the speed of sound?If you like horses more than a plausible story, you will like this. I, for one, will not be picking any more movies simply based upon the Producer."
3,war horse so so,"This movie is about the war, and a horse... but the only pivotal moment is amid the war when it brings people together to help the horse. Other than that, the movie is anti climactic because so little is spoken. Pretty horse, great scenes... but not oscar worthy to me."
3,War Horse,"War Horse is a well written, scored, shot, edited and directed film. Character casting and horse footage are wonderful. One doesn't have to be an avid horse lover to be drawn in by thisaffecting production. It is a film story expertly told, aided and abetted to good effect by the latest cinematic technical tools available. The WWI battle scenes are especially involving and exciting.If any faults are to be found it would be in the seemingly overlong beginning sequences, where the bond between boy and horse are established. While certainly necessary for story development,the forward motion of the film temporarily bogs down here a bit. Additionally, I feel that the film closes perhaps three or four times, where one time would have been more effective. It is for thesereasons that War Horse has lost it's fourth star in my evaluation.Even so, this is definitely a well crafted film, enjoyable and certainly worth experiencing."
2,Beautifully filmed but...,"This film promised to be a classic. Indeed, it should have been a classic. Unfortunately, once all the excellent cinematography is appreciated, the plot, the characters, the script, and the entire film descend into a cloying, maudlin, unwatchable abyss. Thirty minutes into the film, I was ready to abandon any hope for this film's salvation. It's all such a disappointment, that gorgeous piece of horseflesh notwithstanding. Given a good storyline and script, as well as a hefty dose of editing, we could have one of the best films ever. And just as an afterthought, it wouldn't have hurt to tone down those annoying orchestral swells."
2,Disappointing film,"We were disappointed in this movie. Although it was beautifully filmed, it was corny and tedious to watch. I do not recommend it."
2,WAR HORSE,"This was a good story, but the production was almost amaturish. In the scenes where the horse was leaning to plow, unlikely things happened such as having the whole town coming out to this remote farm to watch the horse learn. Really now. Just too Disney like. They looked like they were about to break out in song."
1,Just Horrible!,"Unless you're interested in seeing horrible things happen to horses you won't like this movie! I do not know how it could have gotten a PG-13 rating as there are three scenes I had to turn away from. Granted, I'm one of those people who love animals more than people so I can admit to being biased but I wish someone had told me what was in the movie!"
1,animal abuse at it's worst,"I thought the movie in general was quite good, don't get me wrong, but the idea that anyone would want to tell such a horrific tale about how these horses were treated is beyond me. I understand that this type of thing happened, so it was easy for me to understand the abuse these innocent horses were subjected to. The movie it's self was done well. You felt the pain and drama as if you were there, but after seeing it, when I came home and looked at my own horses, all I could think about was the real life horses that were treated like nothing more than a means to an end. All in all, the movie is directed well and the acting was great, but the story was sad beyond measure, and makes you think about all the horses that died a horrific death at the hands of horrible people."
5,Awesome horse movie!,"Beautiful well done film, story leads from one to another of the horse's life, awesome horse, great story, beautiful horse."
3,Disappointed,"Pros:>Beautiful cinematography, decent soundtrack.>Epic action scenes>Happy ending>Some good moments, a few good lines, good lessons.Cons:>Cliché, overly sentimental, cheesy.>Really obviously unbelievable moments--to the point where it's hard to focus on the ""feel good"" or action because the impossibility or plot hole is too evident.>A lot of the accents sound fake and contrived.Mostly I just didn't know how to feel about it. The first half felt like a kid's movie, with the cheesiness and over-earnest-ness. I got a bit bored and had more than one eyeroll. But I definitely wouldn't show my young kids the war scenes and second half, which had a tendency to get a little gruesome. Couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a family feel-good movie, or an epic. Just a confusing mixture of genres."
3,"""War Horse"" still comes out strong as one of the better ""2000's"" Spielberg productions.","Spielberg does a great job in skillfully executing scenes, both in the battles and the verbal drama. I liked the episodic nature of the film as the the story follows the horse's journeys across the landscape of World War 1 in order to get home. All the while the horse encounters multiple sides of the war and the effects it has on the lives of the people experiencing it. There are plenty of great scenes in the film that I won't spoil because they have to be seen to fully be appreciated. Yeah, I will admit it can get heavy-handedly sentimental at times, but the film presents itself in such a proud and confident manner that it becomes hard to not be effected by it. During the film I found myself caring for the horse and hoping he would get home, which is an achievement within itself. I cannot forget the wonderful score by John Williams, which lends a good hand in bringing out the raw emotion of the film's drama."
4,great movie,great for the whole family. animal lovers. i enjoyed the unknown and it kept me on the edge of my seat.
4,War Horse Movie,My daughter and wife spent two days streaming this movie on our big screen TV. One of the better movies that we have seen in a long time.
1,Bad movie.,The movie does not play. I tried all my DVD players and none of them work with this movie. I won't be buying from this guy again.
5,"Classic For the Ages Movie,","Classic, like Lassie Goes War or Fury , boy & horse,Lovely sets, settings, costuming, backdrops, FX,No gore.Good FX,]Must win a Oscar alone.Timeless for the ages.For all ages to see.In the ranks of Lassie, RinTinTin, Fury, other animal movies.For this GenerationFor all horse lovers to see."
3,The acting is just awe inspiring,This may not be Speilberg's best movie - indeed it is a long way from it. And the only reason the hokey old story worked on stage was because of the amazing puppet work. but the one thing this film did that was just amazing was to get one of the best acting performances ever committed to film from Sarah Jessica Parker. How she never got an Oscar nomination is a crime.
2,Great movie BUT a problem with Blu-ray package,"First, I reeeeeeeeeeeeealy liked the movie but there is an issue with the non-Blu-ray standard packaging. The combo Blu-ray/DVD package does not use the smaller/more compact clear-blue standard Blu-ray package, but rather the older taller DVD packaging form factor. I have been converting my Movie library to Blu-ray for the last few years and very much like the Blu-ray form factor package. Now this box throws off my Blu-ray library shelf."
2,Glaring lapses in cinematography,There were many serious and even amateurish lapses in cinematography. The excessive use of artificial lighting throughout the film resulted in many scenes where 2 sets of shadows can be clearly seen in an outdoor setting. Well Spielberg may be the director but it definitely does not show. All in all a disappointing experience. Expected more attention to important details.
2,"Overly violent kids movie, boring",Boring for adults too violent for kids.Skip it.Too long. Very sad seeing the horses suffering.Story was not interesting.
2,Not in a bluray case.,"To be honest I have not even watched the movie yet, but it gets 3 stars because its a bluray movie in a DVD case. Thus, it will not fit in my Bluray movie rack. What kind of stupid oversight is that?"
2,so so,"Did not hate or love this movie. Great photography, but the story kept going too long and the owner finding his horse at the end was almost a ""what else can we do with this"" type of scene. The happy ending doesn't do away with too many downer scenes that made me wish I had seen a more happy film."
3,best part was the cinematography,"Nice story - beautiful horse(s). Was shot in a VERY BEAUTIFUL LOCATION, so there is some great cinematography here. Technical kudos for the smooth camera work. I can also appreciate the effort and animal trainer talent that had to have gone into this movie.This horse goes from 1 set of hands to another throughout this movie, and the movie follows the horse. There was NO REAL EMOTIONAL INVESTMENT in any of the characters. When the characters lose the horse it is kind of similar to seeing a kid led away from a pet they will not be going home with or being denied the candy bar they so desperately want - you understand they are hurt but you are not moved to cry with them.This movie is interesting enough for one viewing, I THINK MOST WILL ENJOY IT - but I can't see myself wanting to watch this multiple times (as I do when a movie is really good)."
2,Not Spielberg's finest moment,"I figured this movie had to be great. A big, epic, sentimental, war movie with a giant heart centered around a horse. This is his forte--the magical, earnest family movie guaranteed to please like ET.I think he knocks it out of the park, oh, 80% of the time. This was not one of those times. I was bored. I was uninterested in the characters.To me, Seabiscuit is the definitive horse movie. It captured the majesty, speed, and emotion of horses and the people that love them. I didn't feel that at all here. The horse travels through the war from one character to another that I don't care about until the end.The one scene that was effective was where the horse was caught between the two frontlines. That was one magic moment, Spielberg at his best. As it is, I wouldn't sit through it again--glad I didn't buy it sight unseen."
3,Disappointed,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I decided I definitely wanted to see it. As soon as it became available on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to order the movie. Throughout the whole thing I kept waiting for it to improve. The special effects were good, but the story was mundane. Boy gets horse, boy loses horse, boy reunites with horse and lives happily ever after. And I am a life-long horse lover. I really expected more from Spielberg"
3,disapointed,"I was expecting a better film. Not bad, and the filming was very good, but I thought the main plot was a bit weak,(without giving it away if you've not seen it yet). My wife really liked it, but the trailer was better than the actual movie. If you like horse movies, you will probably like it but don't get your hopes up too much. As I said, the filming however was very good. For people who like horse movies, Seabiscuit and Dreamer were better in my opinion. Was too reminicient of Black Beauty, if you know the story. worth watching, but not great."
1,Just terrible.,"Eh, this is one of the few horse movies that I truly didn't like very much. I don't expect everything done by Hollywood to be 100% correct, so I've learned to just accept little technical discrepancies in movies...but war horse was a big joke to me.I can deal with a bit of the fluffy majikal crap just because it comes with the territory, but, let me put it this way, the existence of the unicorns in the movie ""Legend"" was more believable than a good portion of War Horse. If I hadn't paid good money to watch it in the theater, I would have walked out. I wish now I would have waited to watch it on HBO; at least then I would have been able to just change the channel.I like the book, it's a bit touchy-feely-majikal, but it's a children's book, it's supposed to be that way. I guess I expected more from the movie (especially coming from Spielberg) and it was nothing but a massive fail."
1,Just plain stupid,"The movie started off well, but quickly descended into the abyss of improbability. It was so far fetched so as to be beyond the realm of possibility. Too many wild coincidences. Also, there was too much gratuitous sorrow and carnage that seemed to serve no purpose but to make the story seem... well, just plain dumb.It wasn't worth the rental fee and I'm sorry I wasted time watching it."
1,It looked like an amateur movie ..,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in Blu-ray. I'm NOT talking about the PQ .The plot is weak, the acting is ingenious, there are some ridiculous actors, all is superficial and ... how can I say? Is this the director that made ""MUNIQUE""??? I can't believe!!!"
1,Craptacular!,"So how bad could it be? Spielberg, nominated for Best Picture, how bad could it be? Oh my! 10 minutes in and I was waiting for this baby to jump off the screen, sprout feathers, and start running around my living room gobbling. I would call it a trite, over-worked, improbable mess but that would be so unfair to movies that are trite, over-worked, and improbable messes. Wow."
1,'War Horse' Stumbles Right Out Of the Startng Gate - and NEVER Recovers/D-,"Insufferably smarmy, unceasingly saccharine, incredibly cloying and hopelessly overlong (by at least 30 minutes) film version of the very spare (and very moving, at times) Broadway hit of the same name -- arguably Steven Spielberg's biggest misfire since the similarly-cloying, saccharine and smarmy ""Always"", ""Amistad"" and, more recently, Spielberg's (truly interminable)""The Terminal"". A much more apt title for this film would be ""The 100 Years War Horse"" (because it seems to take that long for the film to finally end) ... a truly-misguided effort from start to finish that makes numerous, glaringly-obvious references to dozens of truly great films -- everything from ""My Friend Flicka"", ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Far From the Madding Crowd"", to ""National Velvet"", ""The Quiet Man"" and ""Paths Of Glory"" -- without ever even just ONCE momentarily approaching greatness itself.Unrelenting stall fodder... :( D-"
5,Life As You Know It With A Man And A Dream,"This movie tells the story about the way a man growing into adulthood raises a horse from a baby pony to be trained to do all kinds of special things that the average horse could not as he finds out he is only doing all of this to have this fabulous dream which he worked so hard for to be lost when they need horses of all kinds for the war. He expects it to be only for a while until the war is over, until all of those horses that lived were to be auctioned of at once. As we come to the emotional end or climax and an old man wants his granddaughter to have the dream of her life, the old man bought the horse at the the auction but stopped only to hand over the horse for free back to the young man to one once again at not charge, for doing all of that good to help others in the war. It is emotional and touching and would recommend it and am glad I own it."
5,War Horse,"This movie was very good, sad in parts, but over all a good Saturday night film. It showed the a unbreakable bond between a horse and the young man."
5,Excellent,War Horse is an excellent movie. I saw it at the movies but watching it on my 52 inch TV in the comfort of my home was far better. The sharpness and colors are far more brilliant on the TV than the movie screen...just my opinion.
3,Expecting More,"After watching the previews on TV, I was really expecting it to be a great movie. It's well done and beautiful, but really no substance."
5,WAR HORSE,"THE WAR HORSE WAS INSPIRING TO ALL, AGAIN A TEAR GERKER FOR SOME OF THE FAMILY, AND GOOD DIALOGUE AND STORY FOR ALL AGAIN SUPER STORY!"
4,Wonderful story beautiful film,Love the story and cinematography. Acting is superb. A long film but very enjoyable to watch. This film will make you cry but in a good way. Costumes and scenery beautifully arranged for this story. Horses are magnificent.
4,Good horse movie,"We are a family of people who love horses. This is a great story about the nobility of the horse. The star, (the horse, of course) makes it through harrowing circumstances that would crush mere men. That's why it's a great story. The plot reminded me a little of Black Beauty, but it's different enough to be interesting. Not to mention the photography is phenomenal. I recommend it."
4,Great Horse story,"I ordered this for my husband after stalling for many months. He says it is a great movie. I still can't watch it because I have such a soft spot for animals and can't stand to see them abused or cruely used. I realize it has happened for decades, but choose to not put the images in my head. If you can handle it, then I would recommend it. But have some tissues handy."
5,Great Movie,This is a very good movie about a horse that goes thru various stages in his life and different people and experiences.
5,Moving!,I saw the movie first and that made me want to read the true story of this wonderful horse. I liked the book even better than the movie (and the movie was great). It is a very moving story of the love of a young man for his horse as well as the story of a very brave horse and what he went through in the war.
5,War Horse,"I watched this movie three times so far, it is a great movie and appropriate for the whole family. I have let three other families take this dvd home and they have all enjoyed it."
1,Sorry I wasted 120 minutes of my life watching this one!,"Great Cinema - in fact, it's actually better on mute listening to Dark Side of the Moon . . .There is NO STORY here, nothing feels real or tangible. It's a blur of fantasy and loud noises with no purpose. I wouldn't even give it away."
1,Leave this one on the shelf,"This film had a ""plot"" that was neither engaging or believable. It had a lot of noise and sporadic maelstrom of ""action"" but all without meaning or coherence. I kept asking myself, ""So what is the point?"" and ""Where is this going?"" and ""Who cares?"" The scenery was, like the background music, sometimes really lovely and the only thing enjoyable about the film. I felt sorry for the actors, trying to bring out of the screenplay what had never been put in. I bought this film because it was directed by Spielberg, but the low price should've tipped me off that it wasn't one of his best. It wasn't. If you like horse stories, save your money for a great film like ""Seabiscuit"" with Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper, or--even better--buy and read the book of that name by Laurel Hillenbrand."
1,"Too much horse, not enough war","I didn't have high expectations for this film and I was still disappointed. The first half of this overly long film was the boy with his horse on their shabby little farm. Boring..... You'd get more action from a ""Wonderful World of Disney"" episode from the 1960s. There were a few exciting war scenes, but it was way too long and mostly uninteresting."
1,Boring,"I was really looking forward to this movie, but I was very disappointed. It isn't interesting. The story is very slow and dull, and it is extremely boring."
1,Uplifting movie not so uplifting,"War Horse was advertised as ""Uplifting"", but I found nothing uplifting about this film at all; though I did find it realistic. There were many people and horses left dead in this film and it was a miracle (if a true story) the horse and it's owner survived, but after all the death and carnage that was left behind I really found nothing happy or uplifting about the ending. Very dissapointed with this movie and I would not suggest showing this film to a horse lover or children under 12 years of age. My wife and I are both horse lovers and from our standpoint this movie was absolutely horrible."
1,Huge and Insulting disappointment...,"This is the most contrived movie I have ever seen. I imagine that the title of each scene says something like, ""And this is the scene where we make the audience cry,"" or ""In this scene, we create sympathy for the poor horses."" I was eager to see this movie and had a hard time finishing it. It made me flat out angry. I know people who loved it... people are different!"
2,"Slow moving, rather dull movie",This movie took a good long while to get going. I purchased for two reasons. Steven Spielberg and location. I guess I should have read more reviews because I had no idea how boring of a story this was.
5,Excellent,"Very good movie, entertaining,kept my attention. Great story line. Where he was caught in the wires seemed so real, was a little hard for me."
5,awsom,"I purchased war horse as we had seen it at the movies and wanted to see it again, its such as beautiful movie, very sad, a lot of handkies are needed, but I would recommend it. Im not a horse person, but I was amazed at these horses and the things they went through."
2,NOT for horse lovers.,This movie started out well. As the movie progressed it got to to point I had to stop watching it. (My daughter continued to watch and I only listened) I could not stand seeing the abuse of so many horses. Though I know that no horses were actually harmed in the making of the movie it was hard to see horses killed and driven to the point of dropping to the ground totally worn out and then shot dead. On one hand it is a somewhat uplifting story but the animal abuse depicted out weighed that. I wish I had not watched it.
4,War Horse,My husband and I saw the movie. I purchased this for my grand children who had never seen it. They enjoyed it.
5,War Horse,"Read the book first, the book is written with the War Horse view of the story.Liked the movie and the DVD, its just an amazing story of the horses and theroll they played in Word War One.It was rather sad to see how most were just abandoned at the wars end."
5,"War Horse, the Movie.",All I can do is sum up this review in one word-OUTSTANDING!!!!! It tells a story that will hold your undivided attention from beginning to end.
4,I enjoyed this - but it's not for everyone,"I read a lot of the '1 star' reviews and felt that many who gave this 1 star either did so because they felt this portrayed animal cruelty (it's called War Horse for a reason - and yes, horses got slaughtered in WWI), or they got bored with the lead up to the story.....but one thing I noticed was how vague many of those reviews were - only one reviewer tried to give explicit examples of why they felt certain scenes were far fetched - and in my opinion, didn't do a very good job and backing up their point - so, let me just say I enjoyed this movie. It entertained me, and had some moving scenes that I felt were touching and appropriate - I liked it and would recommend it to others"
4,It was good,It was a good movie but not quite what I was expecting. I liked though and have watched it more than once.
2,War horse,"too much atrocities,death, cruaulties.the 'happy ending' is chidlish.But at least it shos how all animals are mistreated and abused during war,horses,dogs ."
5,Gut wrenching story,There are few movies which I can stand to watch more than a few times. This is one of those movies I can watch over and over. I see something I've missed each time I watch. Loved the storyline and acting of characters. I would recommend this movie to all.
4,Great Movie!,I can see how this would become a classic like Iron Will and the Black Stallion. The story did not go how I expected which was a nice surprise and loved the ending! The cinematography was phenomenal!
4,Short but sweet of it,"I had only one complaint.Too much close ups of old guys nostrils,and not enough of the star !!When he jumped all the bttle field fences,heck he was home,movie over.So with more star close ups,esp with him running,the movie would be a 10"
5,Finally saw it.,"My wife and I passed on seeing this in a theater due to us most likely sobbing at ""those parts"". We elected to see it in our own theater and let er loose. I know how good it is and have read all about it. That and Speilberg makes it a sure thing for us. Can't wait to see it on our own theater as it was put together for films such as this.OK, I have now seen this movie. My wife refused as she is emotionally attached to horses as she used to show them. I felt bad after this movie mostly because of the way these animals were treated at that war. I suppose the ending was a happy one (spoiler alert). But the scenes were to graphic for me. Human carnage i can tolerate but not animals. Besides the above comment, the movie was exceptional and typical Spielberg, excellent production, maybe to excellent. I doubt i watch it again unless I want to be reminded of how animals are treated in our history."
3,Warhorse good European Acting Spiced with Poor Hollywood Style.,"This could have been a great movie with realistic effects. Spielberg went cheap. The storyline was a little farfetched, the timeline jumped incomprehensibly and it was pure Hollywood style. The special effects were poorly done, the editing did not always make sense and some lines were pure corny and predictable. However, the scenery was beautiful, and the acting well done, Why not go the extra nine yards to clean up a potentially great movie? My guess is they didn't know how with their budget constraints."
2,Melodramatic,Altogether a contrived effort to conjure up a Lassie like response. Even the storybook place of origin reflects Lassie movies.
3,screen type,Was disappointed that dvd was not full screen.My tv is led whivh is supposed to allow for a brighter pictures but many scenes were very dark and hard to distinguish persons & places. Would like to exchange my dvd for full screen and hope that it would be beer viewing. The war scenes with Calvary in full gallop and the many horses used had to be a hard task to accomplish.Let me know if my dvd can be exchangedteba
3,war horse ok,"i enjoyed war horse thought it to be choppy,and even a smart horse isnt going to step up to help his""budding""the way war horse did 3 times. this was supposed to be real life."
3,Simply Warhorse,"This is kind of a simplistic flick, but its not bad. I found myself wondering how this was done as a stageplay."
1,Terrible movie and awful music!,"Let me start by saying that I really expected to love this movie, but no so much! The soundtrack for this movie is HORRIBLE and it plays so loud at times you cant even hear what the characters are saying. There is NO character development for anyone...not even the horse. The storyline was totally unreal too. I had to fast forward through some of it because it was so difficult to watch. I expected more from Spielberg (sp?). The idea of the story is good and it could have been great but it just wasn't developed enough. One more thing about the music, it did not match the story at all and was annoying!"
1,"Typical Hollywood Misrepresentation of Horses, Anthropomorphic Nonsense",If you or you kids love horses skip this ignorant movie. This sort of trash can scar a kid for life because of the lies about horse and human relationships that this movie teaches. Horse behavior is seriously misrepresented as in most Hollywood movies. Anthropomorphism of horses at it's worst. Story is ridiculous even for a cartoon much less a movie. People in the movie are realistically stupid though.
1,Skip This,"This movie is almost unwatchable. It's like Saving Private Ryan crashed into Black Beauty and all the good parts were destroyed.The first act seems to be written for 4 year olds. The script is so sickly sweet it gave me a headache and Director Steven Spielberg seems to have pulled the characters fro the book ""Cliche English characters for dummies"". Once the story moved onto the battlefield the movie makers seemed to give up on the dialogue altogether and we got endless beauty/heroic shots of the horse and main character. This part seems to have been produced with the sole object of making 9 year old girls cry. I can't review the end of the movie because with less than 20 minutes to go I gave up and stopped watching. This shouldn't matter really, because even though I'm a fan of some of Spielbergs' work he very rarely knows how to end his movies.Even worse than War of the Worlds. Don't waste your money."
4,"Interesting first album from a ""hard to categorise"" band","When I first put this CD in my player, I was not expecting such diverse album because of relatively modest album cover. But what I listened is a very well crafted mix of Rock, Jazz and Pop in the style of Steely Dan, Prince and even some Limp Bizkit in the end.Performance is flawless and compositions are really unique. Harmonies are rich and melodies are catchy. There is a Pop attitude definitely but arrangements are quite complex. Also I must admit that lyrics are really heartfelt and honest."
3,Hard to Read,"It's easy to see why Litvinenko was poisoned with Polonium when you read this book. It's laden with so many evil plots it leaves the reader with doubts about the authenticity of some of the material. Although most of it is believable, there is the problem of a lack of sufficient references. This, unfortunately, is due to the need to keep many of them secret in order to protect their lives.The book is not well organized, and constantly jumps from one time period to another. There is an acronym page that I had to constantly refer to while I was reading. Felshtinsky admits the book is a hard read, and he is right. There are hundreds of Russian names which are hard to keep up with.It could have been better. The subject matter is fascinating when you can figure it out.."
4,Tragic Tale,"This book is not about the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. But it is the book that got him murdered. If you imagine Russia as a nation on the mend from its communist sickness, think again. The former KGB and FSB operative (Litvienko) and his academic friend (Felshtinsky) published their book in Russia and it enraged Don Vito Putin. Putin, you'll recall, was the man about whom George W. Bush said: ""I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy . . . I was able to get a sense of his soul."" As Litvenko lay dying he wrote the following to Putin:""You may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price. You have shown yourself to be as barbaric and ruthless as your most hostile critics have claimed.""You have shown yourself to have no respect for life, liberty or any civilized value.""So much for President Bush's soul sense."
4,The Artistry of Ari Eisinger,"A very nice compilation of Ari playing some of his excellent tunes and with very accomplished playing. A little surprised he didn't highlight Blind Boy Fuller given his instruction DVD of him and his obvious high regard for him. His concluding thoughts given in part as advice for guitar learning, was as good as anything I've ever heard. Can certainly identify with his thoughts."
5,Great Intro to TCM Diet,"This book is an abbreviation of the author's earlier title Prince Wen Hui's Cook. It contains simple, toned-down information for the layperson, which is easily accessible to the average reader.The information presented, is solid, and helpful. You will get a basic introduction to the concept of interplay between the 5 elements as they relate to flavor, and the effects they have on organs.Info includes organ functions based on TCM, how they are affected by various foods, as well as other organs, and how to treat various ailments by adding or subtracting various elements to your diet.Great book for the average reader interested in TCM's dietary elements, or anyone generally interested in improving their health."
5,oldies,The cd is great my mother absolutely loves it. I will probably be ordering other things in the future. The cd was in great condition and sounded aamazing.
5,The best!,"My husband and I (and our daughters) eat only vegetarian at home (I also try to be exclusively vegetarian elsewhere, and generally succeed), and I'm always on the lookout for new recipe ideas. Well, my friend sent me this as a gift and it is awesome. It is delicious, has great ideas, and best of all it really is quick and easy. If you want to make sure you can get a healthy vegetarian meal on the table in no time flat and not be bothering with a lot of complicated directions, this is IT. I subscribe to Vegetarian Times and while I think it's good, they are always asking me to pull out a food processor or some other such nonsense I have no time for. Not PDQ! Bless them!"
5,A great asset for the Vegetarian!!!,"I love this book. I made three recipes in the first week I owned it. Recipes are easy and tasty. The title says it all. Each recipe is quick to make. I refer to it often when I need a quick vegetarian meal to prepare. Even my husband, a dedicated carnivore enjoys the meals I prepare from this.If you're looking for a great vegetarian cookbook to refer to, I highly recommend this one. There are even substitutions for vegans to enjoy."
5,Super vegetarian/vegan cookbook!!!,"I am thrilled that I purchased The PDQ Vegetarian Cookbook. The recipes are fast, delicious, healthy and easy to understand and prepare. I use my book everyday and enjoy it tremendously. I feel empowered and more in charge of my health and the health of my family. A vegetarian/vegan lifestyle doesn't have to be complicated or overwhelming. This book has boosted my confidence level in my kitchen. My two daughters have already requested copies of their own, when they move out. Thank-you PDQ!"
3,Could have been better.,"I enjoyed Donna Klein's last book, ""The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen"", so decided to give this book a try. The first thing that got my attention was this book claims to need no knifes, graters, mixers, blenders or food processors to prepare the recipes.I was surprised, a book so determined on time, did not include estimated preparation times for the recipes. Everything I tried turned out OK, but they could have been much better. Some of the recipes could have even been easier. In the baked potato soup, Klein mashes the ingredients endlessly with a potato masher. I could have used my food processor or immersion blender more quickly, and with better results.I will continue to make many of her dishes, but I will probably ditch her methods. I'd rather use a knife than resort to bagged or frozen vegetables."
5,Good hair product for messy hair styles.,"This product is key to getting a messy head look without being too sticky or greasy. I apply it when my hair is still damp and use it to create a messy, textured look for the short hair on the back of my head. The texture of the product is light and almost like meringue and pudding crossed. It is not greasy or sticky. It's a light green color and smells faintly of apples. It's very pleasant. When it dries there is no residue and it does not dry crunchy. I use a different product to create stiff spikes on the top of my head. This product creates a ""messy"" look that is still pliable and does not stiff or freeze the hair. It holds without any additional products. I would definitely buy this again."
3,"Good rice, kind of pricey","Gourmet rice for sure, especially the jasmati. Still ... overpriced compared to what I can get local. Works great in our steamer."
2,what confused me,"What I did not understand; the rice was pricy.. ordered , Sept 2012.and the use by dates were different 2/ for12/ 13and the other 2/ for 16/6.. that varies for 3 years ??also the brow rice did not have the nutty flavor of other brands I have used."
3,RiceSelect Basic trial Pack 4-jar set,"I would like to order this, but can't find what size each jar is? Is each jar the 36 oz size, like the single Basmati rice jar?"
3,Not the best N adapter for the money,"Although this card does a great job of connecting you to any far away networks like a good N card is required to do, I would highly recommend searching for another version.On the plus sign, installation is simple and easy. The instructions are a page long (per operating system), and are all obvious steps.On the other hand, this card takes an eternity to find the networks when the computer first boots up, while a G adapter will do so almost immediately.Also, if your SSID is not being broadcast, there is no option of searching for that specific SSID, so you are required to use another computer (or adapter) to make it viewable, connect, and then hide it again.Again, this product does do its job, but not to the satisfactory level that most customers would desire."
3,wound not recommned this product to anyone else !!!,"I wasn't able to get > 100 mbps for 1 year until I have to reinstall my windows without unplugging it (installation manual is bullshit). windows 7 automatically detects this card perfectly without its driver. My problem is somehow right now it does not connect to the internet anymore. I am a computer expert so know this is a hardware problem. After spending hard working time on it, I figured out it did not work on channel 3 which is set on my router. Adjust back to channel 6 and problem was solved."
1,Misleading Image,"There are three images for the product whenI ordered and as I type this review: two picture a unit with long antennas and the last, if you click to it, shows a unit with short antennas. I received the short antenna unit, which has poorer signal than a single-antenna unit I was trying to replace.Additionally: the software included with this unit, while it does support Windows Vista, has not been optimized and still includes a (mandatory) very poor interface designed to run on top of the Windows XP wifi settings.Overall, I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
4,works well with win7x64,"Bought this card to replace my wireless adapter that I was giving to a friend. I figured since I had a wireless N Trendnet router that a wireless N wireless adapter may make a difference. Can't say I've noticed a huge difference, but the card was a simple plug and play. Router is on the first floor and I get between 3 and 4 bars of signal at a steady 108+mbps about 15 feet away on the second floor."
2,Lame connection,"ProsInstalls very easily, intuitive, works without drivers installed.ConsIt just doesn't cut it, my internet is incredibly slow, even after I installed the drivers my connection is laughable. I bought a massive external antenna in the hopes that would help, we'll see what happens."
4,Not Bad,"I have yet to test the card's maximum transfer rate of 300mbps because I don't own a router that sends at that speed. The card does what it's suppose to. I can connect to the internet fine. Occasionally, it loses connection with the router. Easy to install, just plug in to your motherboard. Then install the driver only. I don't bother using the included hardware, I just use Windows to regulate the wireless connection."
5,ooh let's go!,"I cannot believe that no one has reviewed this fantastic CD yet! I hope that it's because people are just too busy listening/dancing to it! If you like funk, real funk, if you like sax music, if you like Candy Dulfer, especially when she's saxing and not singing (as in ""right in my soul""--her latest), and if you're ready to be knocked out by her father, who has just as much sax in his soul as she has--go get it, no matter what the price is! There's also a beautiful piece called ""indian vibes"" and another called ""sambastic"" for a little variety. Man/Woman, you don't have any idea what you're missing and it'll hurt a while once you do (but the hurt will disappear FAST!"
5,Great at a Seder!,"We used it to keep the kids busy at a Seder. Worked like a charm! Just their knowing they had something to do if they wanted, eased their tension, and we felt like they actually paid more attention than usual.The activities are at all levels -- some can be quite challenging and some at easy level."
5,Bianchi 100 IWB Holster,Great little holster for my Officer's Model Colt. Fits perfect and holds the gun securely. Able to reholster without too much trouble without looking as long as your belt isn't too tight which can cause the holster to close. Comfortable and great concealment holster.
1,Not as advertised.,"Bought this holster because it advertised it would fit the Taurus PT 111, it doesn't,, very disapointing. I have Bianchi holsters and have always been satisfied, again, the model 100 does not fit Taurus 45 APC PT 111."
3,Stars according to not working game,"I got this game, and it didn't work on my new Windows professional 7 computer. I have all the requirements. I know alot of tricks and things for getting games to work when they don't, however nothing helped. Didn't work for me."
3,"A fun, but short, game.","The game is fun and has an atmosphere that pulls you into the world. For the most part puzzles are intuitive though sometimes it's not clear what time period to be in.Playing the game through is fun, but make sure to save the game at every chapter. There are many different endings to the game. Look up what chapter to save and load from each time you finish the game. Let the credits scroll through at the end and it will tell you what ending you got (using a letter system). If you get all the endings then there is extra game play.Playing to get all endings gets very tedious even though it explains more of the story. When playing on the PC my system started blaring a loud single tone so I was forced to stop. I have not gotten all the endings as of yet.If you can, get it for the PS2. I originally played it on the PS2 many years ago."
4,Just like I remembered,"I used to have this game for PlayStation, and really liked it. The movement sometimes was a little difficult in tight corners, but overall a really good, fun game.The PC version is pretty much the same as I remember the Playstation game being. The controls are even similar, which on a PC, is not a good thing. There's no option for using the mouse for movement (you use the arrow keys), and the buttons used to open the inventory and the map are non-intuitive. You use control and shift instead of the more obvious ""I"" and ""M"". Thankfully, the game comes with a sheet that explains the controls, but I found that my first time through the game I had to have that sheet sitting in front of me and I had to reference it often.But, I can't complain too much. The actual play of the game and the plot are still a lot of fun, and I highly recommend the game. Just maybe for Playstation instead of PC."
4,great game,"this is a good game i tried it before on site and it stalled thats why i bought the disk, its a puzzle game that requires some thinking overall great game"
2,The Circle Of Boredom,"I know a few people who adore this game, but it bored me silly. It is a game of circles too, can kinda drive you nuts."
1,Pure crap I can't stress this enought pure crap,"there is a reason why I bought this from a big lots bin for 3.99. this game is utter crap I can't believe I wasted that much money on a piece of garbage. I mean come on thats a happy meal we are talking about. I could have feed my kid.... and I don't have one thats how bad it was. Game flow was horrible, voice acting could be done better by a bum... who got his mouth smashed in with a hammer... also he had his voice box removed. the run of the game and flow are just terrible... serious do your self a favor... buy a piece of cheese and nibble it... it will provide more hours of satisfaction then this piece of garbage :)"
2,The earring kept slipping off,These earrings looked very nice once I received them. They were a gift for my grandmother and she loved them. Unfortunately when she wore them to an event they kept coming off. The clip just were not tight enough or something so she ended up taking them off to keep from losing them.
4,Excellent reference!,"This book is an excellent medium-level introduction to Database design. As a programmer, I was never really taught how to design efficient DBs or rather the art of doing it effectively. Believe it or not working with databases is more than just using SELECT or UPDATE commands. I believe DB Design is for rather medium to advanced users. So, others complains about the level of this book is unfair and irrelevant in my opinion. But you be the judge of that."
5,Fantastic! Comprehensive reference for novice and expert.,"I am very impressed with the presentation of the material to cover introductory as well as advanced topics. I am a senior developer and still involved with designing of systems. I regard myself as an expert designer. This is a book you can buy and keep for a long time. There are some topics covered which I have always wondered about in my 25 years of software development, and now I have everything together in one book. Database design is a crucial aspect of all systems and can make or break your system especially in terms of maintainability. This book will surely help you design robust databases that can live long in your application - a must have for every database designer and programmer!"
4,Good next-step in growth of understanding,I found this to be a good practical growth step in understanding database design. He explains the basics and steps into good illustrations. The book is not focused on any one db vendor. The second half of the book is a case study.
3,For Beginners Only,"Potential readers should pay attention to the title -- this is definitely a beginner's book. However, it's among one of the better intro texts on databases on the market.Overall, the guidance provided by this book is sufficient. Experienced readers will find some valuable knowledge, but can probably skip the case study.The section on normalization, while not 100% accurate, includes meaningful visuals that help explain normalization in an approachable way.This book, along with the ""Mere Mortals"" books, is a pretty good introduction to practical database design."
1,Not a book for beginners,"I have read the first 5 chapters of this text and I can't believe they are marketing this text at beginners. If I was a beginner I would get absolutely nothing out of this book. I am not a beginner and it still offers nothing of value in the first 5 chapters. It uses database-related terms before they are ever defined and then when they are defined the reader is left with the feeling - ""What did that mean?"". The examples are not well developed and add nothing to the text. I am surprised that the publisher did not have some ""beginners"" read this text and comment. I do not have the stamina to finish the book."
1,"Very, *very* poorly written book","This book is horribly written. The English here is perhaps the worst in any published work that I have ever seen -- it feels like the effort of a not particulary bright ESL student. No effort at confusing the reader has been spared, and often what should be a simple subject-verb-object statement has been twisted and gnarled and randomly punctuated so its meaning can only be gleaned by context, careful repeated readings, and a few drops of Jolt in the eyes. There are so many errors that should have been caught by the cursoriest of glances that I doubt there was any proofreading done at all. I'd tend to blame more the publisher than the author for this fiasco (Wrox sux?), primarily for exacting a book of someone who shouldnt be writing anything more complicated than his initials."
2,Looks great... Drilling REQUIRED!!,"Bought this item in the hopes to install myself. After opening the package I find out i need to drill into the frame of my Jeep and peel back some of my wheel well lining. Product says ""No drilling required"" ""Easy installation."" Far from it! The bar looks great... Once I get it on the Jeep we will see if it was worth it..."
1,Don't bother!,"I ordered these as a replacement for the Smitty Built bars I've had for ten years since they were starting to develop rust. I assumed that they would be an even swap out and I could use the existing holes. WRONG! They have been completely redesigned, and for no reason. Also now made in China. I always say that if it's not broke, don't fix it. Instead of frame mounts, they are now mounted to the body, requiring more drilling and cutting away of the plastic wheel well covers. Now for the fit and finish...they don't! I had to contact the techs at Smitty Built twice and got no good answer or fix. I had to drill new holes in the forward mount plates to get them to fit and when complete they don't fit straight or come out as far making them only a toe step. In hind sight, I should have sent them back. You'd be wise to find another brand. Funny thing is, I sold my old set on line and the buyer wanted them because they were frame mounted and he couldn't get his set of these to fit either."
3,It works,"So much for a no drill application, it's not mounteg to the frame as other nerfs I've owned in the past."
4,"great look, but...","These look really good when installed, solid feel too... only major pain, mounting brackets should be marked clearer. Instead of marking the brackets F and R, they look so much alike, a simple LF,LR,RF, and RR should be stamped ... this would clear up alot of head scratching and slight confusing. Outside of the brackets and drilling they say you don't need but have to do, i'd give it 5 stars..."
2,This is not what was described.,"This is a good-quality, cotton flag. Unfortunately, it was advertised as a nylon flag, which is what we wanted. Also, beware that the stars are pictured as being silver, which I guess they were before the flag was ""antiqued"" - the stars and stripes are tan. Very antique-y looking, if that's what you're looking for. Definitely different than pictured."
2,A used book not a new one,Two things make me unhappy with this purchase. 1. the book doesn't look like a new book as it was advertized although I paid for new. It has crease in the cover page and coffee-like stain at the bottom of many pages; 2. it took over 2 weeks to ship it to me.
4,"Solid light, but a little big for a keychain","I bought a KeyMate to use as a zipper pull on my backpack, since i already have severaleGear PICO Zipper Light, Blues on keys and jackets and such. I knew it was a little bit bigger, but didn't realize by how much. It's definitely more rugged and easier to operate one-handed than the PICO or a Streamlight Nano. In Titanium finish, with aggressive knurling, it looks pretty badass too. I'm not sure why they put a pocket clip on such a small light though. Maybe for clipping to a hat brim?In any case, the KeyMate is only slightly brighter than the Nano or PICO, but if you're going to carry a light this big on your keychain, spend the extra money and get aFenix E05 R2 Flashlight. That's what i carry. It's thinner, only a tiny bit longer, runs on a single easy-to-find AAA (i use lithiums), and MUCH brighter, with a cleaner, whiter beam."
3,Titanium my behind...,"Why do people insist on using the word ""Titanium"" to describe a metalic product that has not one spec of titanium in it?That just rubs me the wrong way.But that's besides the point.I knew it wans't titanium when I bought it.As for the light:It's small enough for a keychain, or better, clipped inside a purse or pack.(prefer the Streamlight NANO for keychain. it's 1/2 this size.)Light is very bright. Enough to hurt you.The thing looks really good, and to me, it feels good. Very macho texturing.Price is, eh, well, ok. A little high I guess, but in the ballpark.Over all, I like it.It WOULD have gotten 4 stars.Calling it ""Titanium"" lost a star, and deserved to gain this public slaping:*** SLAP - SLAP - SLAP ***There.Justice having been done, I'll be on my way.Oh, and if you are still interested, I'm sure you'll be pleased with this nice quality ALUMINUM pocket LED.Makes a great gift, too.-Berk"
2,Twist on-off a killer,"Twist on design means you can never have the cap screwed on tightly. I have had the cap screwed to where it was just barely in the ""off"" position. It would flicker on and off and burn through the batteries. Old batteries are now stuck in the case rendering it useless."
2,Unimpressed,"Clip broke putting on my keys for the first time. I don't expect the swivel to stand up much longer. I think the clip is too tight. Would be tough to get on clothing, maybe jeans.I bought this to replace a Princeton Tec which had a hold-all-the-time button that I was tired of dealing with. The twist-on functionality seems a bit lacking as pressing down on the lens will also turn it on unless you are sure to twist quite far to the off position. I expect to see my pocket shining frequently, but may not be such a big issue.It also appears more durable to the eye than to the touch, but I imagine it will stand up to a pretty rough treatment anyway.In summation I think its possible to get cheaper, smaller lights that are just as bright/good. It should be plenty bright enough for any reasonable person though.I'll write back if it breaks any worse than it already has."
5,"Tiny, but oh so bright!",This is the smallest (and cutest!) flashlight I own. I hardly notice it on my keychain. It puts out WAY more light than I was expecting. Great value for the price.
5,powerful,"It's amazing, It works better than a normal flashlight no matter the size, providing enough illumination for almost everything you need, considering you can carry it in your pocket.It's a key chain flashlight, don't expect thousand of candles of illumination, but it is ""full of muscles"".I'm considering to buy other 2, one for my sister and a spare one for me."
4,Cool,These little lights work very well. I put mine on my key chain so I can unlock my door at night. The light itself is very intense and does a great job.
3,"Small, heavy duty but expensive batteries!","This is an overall sturdy little flash light that can go on your key chain. Also, it's bright and clean light for its size. However, the fact that it takes 4 small batteries that cost $4/battery ($16 total!!!) is a bit much! That's why I docked it 2 stars because the flash light was only $7.However, if you have access to free or low cost batteries then you'll probably love this little thing.So two thumbs up for performance and two thumbs down for TCO!"
5,"with this lighting industry- there are cheap and then the ones who work- YOU KNOW, ""PAY ME NOW OR PAY ME LATER.""","WHOLE ENTIRE FAMILY HAS ONE, TRIED AT LEAST 10-15 OTHER WITH THE HELP OF MY FATHER IN LAW.... PERFECTLY DESIGN FOR HEAVY USE TO JUST HELPING WHILE WALKING AT NIGHT... ALWAYS WORKS, O'YA, ALWAYS WORKS............. PERIOD ........1-302-528-0442"
5,Very handy little flash light at a good price,"This flash light was much better than I had expected.Compact size,very bright and well made.I am very pleased with it and it is definitely one of the best things that I have bought through Amazon."
4,Great little light,"This little light is awesome, its about as big as a chap stick and easily fits on my key change. The amount of light it puts out is equal to or better than a Mini Mag light (2AA style). Since putting it on my key change I find a use for it all the time."
4,"Excellent, compact light","I own both the Nano and KeyMate lights. I use the Nano as a keychain light due to its smaller size/light weight and keep the KeyMate clipped to my jacket or backpack. The Nano is more impressive due in part to its size and low cost but the KeyMate is small, rugged, and really bright for such a small package. Definitely a good buy if you want a light that is slight larger than the Nano and more rugged."
2,"strong light, weak key chain","The light on this flashlight is fairly strong for such a small one. However, the clip broke the first day I got it."
3,"Well, it works.","I bought this to replace my Maglite, (which lasted almost 6 years on my keychain) and after five months I've got no complaints. There's some cosmetic damage and the finish is worn in spots but it's quite minor, all together. Comparing it to myStreamlight Microstream, it's about half as long, and slightly thicker. The light seems to be approximately as bright but the Keymate has a stronger 'whiteness' and is a bit harsh. Comparing it to theStreamlight Nano, it's considerably larger; about twice as long and about three times the volume. It also lacks the Nano's 'feature' of spontaneous self dis-assembly. It's got a nice balance of endurance, durability, size and power. If I were limited to one light, for most purposes, I'd make it this one."
3,Great light but problems with turn type on off mechanism,"I love this light, and it take a more standard button battery than its little brother the nano. It is durable, effective, and long lasting. However, over the time I have owned it it has come unscrewed in my pocket twice (dumping the batteries). This might just be me, but it is annoying and usually results in loss of batteries. I carry it daily (on my key chain) and use it at least once a week."
3,Durable yet light,"The flashlight works well. It is bright for such a small thing. The lanyard doesnt go on very well, but I made it work. There should be another way to attach the lanyard. Otherwise its a great product"
3,It's good and light is strong ...But,It's good and light is strong ....But the price is high ... I wish to drop their price in order to advise the people
5,"bright, little light","This little light is bright and has survived living in my pocket with the keys for a month now.The pocket clip is so tight that it took several times of bending it out to make it usable, so it is also strong.The key clasp is great since that is how it has been attached to all the keys in my pocket and has not escaped.Very nice light for a reasonable amount of money."
3,This is an audio only tribute music DVD.,This is an audio only tribute music DVD (various artists performing Pink Floyd songs) distributed by the Navarre Corporation. It is not a video DVD.Printed on the cover of the DVD is:An All Star Lineup Performs The Songs Of Pink Floyd.The follwing information comes from the Navarre.com website:Title: PINK FLOYD DVDPublisher: CLEOPATRA RECORDS INCLabel: CLEOPATRAArtist: VARIOUSFormat: DVD MUSICRating:Ages:UPC: 741157135695Selection: CLP 1356Navarre P/N: 2123580Carton Qty: 30Release Date: 03/30/2004MSRP: $14.98Track Listing:1.

3,mixed signals,"The Audio portion of the DVD is really good, the interpretations of classic Floyd songs are pretty fantastic actually with some very accomplished musicians sporting beautiful solos....Edgar Winters on sax and Dweezil Zappa on guitar to name a couple....each song has a different line up. If you have a 5.1 DVD player I highly recommend this. However, the Video portion is horrendous. I've never seen such lame visuals in all my life. It might look OK to the very stoned or hard tripping. Otherwise it stinks. So Actually I give the audio 5 stars and the video part zero stars, hence the 3 stars."
2,5.1 Audio CD on a DVD format,"I should have checked the reviews first...I already owned this CD so I was excited with the prospect of seeing the All-Star Line-up... :(This is just the audio of the CD recorded on a DVD format that features some graphs...For the $1.98 I paid, I should not complaint... It sounds good on 5.1"
3,"Feels great, smells terrible","I will not repurchase this face wash.While it feels absolutely great, making my face feel soft and moisturized, it has a very strong smell that lasts for about 3 hours. It is hard to describe the scent, not artificial, but strong and not ""herbal"", it *almost* triggers headaches for me like artificial fragrances, but not quite. There is no amount of skin improvement that would make me keep this smell.If you are not bothered by smells, snap this up as it does make my face feel great."
4,"works great,fast shipping",This filter really smelled bad during first use then after a day it worked just like you would expect it to. I would buy this again.I'm chalking the smell up to it being new.
4,adequate replacement for a lot less money,"Decided to try these less-densely-packed honeycombed paper filters for our indispensable humidifier. Dry air during the heating season is brutal, and these seem to draw well, and last as well as the originals."
1,Hard to install,"If you want a seat that looks good, this is the seat for you. If you want a seat that you can install correctly, DON'T BUY THIS ONE! This seat is IMPOSSIBLE to install securely. I don't know if it's the armrests or where the latch is located, but it is a struggle to try to get this seat installed."
2,Not a good toddler seat,"I thought I would really like this seat when I purchased it. I was looking for something that would work well until my child was big enough to need a booster, then work as a comfy booster as well. Problem is, the seat is almost impossible to install properly in most vehicles. I happen to have captain's seats in my van, and was able to rig it using the adjustments on the seat itself so that the carseat is in properly, but that is the ONLY way! I am a certified carseat tech too, so its not just a matter of not knowing how. My other complaint is the scoop of the back - when the child falls asleep, her head falls forward. Not very comfortable. I am hoping this works better as a booster."
4,I love tina,The lyrics were nice but the new tone of the music was not that appealing but the club that sent me the cd is awesome they had my cd out to me in a week. Thanks
2,Weird Aftertaste,"I was disappointed in this bar, after having tried the peanut marshmallow yesterday, which I thought was very tasty. For some reason, this flavor has a strong aftertaste."
4,Good Product,"Great Pedal overall. Has played plenty of gigs with not so much as even a slight problem. Sturdy as hell, great effects, mods etc. Very easily connects to your pc for recording or for practicing with songs. It does take the manual to make out all the abbreviations for the many settings(which it has a lot of). Minor flaw but who monkeys with that stuff at a gig? I usually play with it ahead of time for my overall sound and tweak it at the gig based on the acoustics of the place we are playing at. I would recommend this pedal to anyone wanting a sleek, small (some pedal efx units are huge, this one easily travels or packs up), durable, do it all pedal. Is it perfect - no but the plus's way out number the negatives"
2,To much line noise - bad user interface,"I got this after looking at Line 6 down low products. This has a lot of features and all of them work. The user interface is extremely poor, and so are the directions. Follow the instructions and try to learn it and this can be over come. The unit it self is quality, it makes the Line 6 Bass Pod look like a toy. The drum machine is the best feature followed by the headphone out. I returned mine due to the line noise. The company has a FAQ and will respond to email. I did end up purchasing a ZOOM MTR3 to use as a practice track and I will not do a DSP until the tech catches up a good DSP is very expensive and you get what you pay for. I did not have the unit long enough to install the software, however it is a limited older version, but it is mac compatible."
4,My 2nd favorite soap book,"I am continually drawn to this book. For those of us that need to create more than just a basic soap, this is a wonderful resource. Three basic cold process recipe bases are provided... the concept behind each recipe is: pure/natural. Yes, much of the soap is ideal for gift-giving with whole cloves pressed into the surface of one, gold leaf rubbed onto another, but some of us like to be cleaned luxuriously...that is the appeal for me. Soapmaking experience is required, I feel. If you have an artistic soul this book will encourage you to create. I only wish it were a longer book."
3,Not for beginners,"This was my first book on soap making, and although the pictures are beautiful I didn't learn enough to feel comfortable trying the recipes. I think this is a good book for getting your creative juices flowing, but unless you are experienced in soap making, you won't get much from this book. There is no in-depth explanation of oils, scents, colors, or anything. Actual instruction in soap making was two pages. No saponification tables, no rebatching instruction, and no discussion of different types of soap making (only cold process). Very vague about many things. I would not recommend this book for a beginner. For ideas and pretty pictures get this book."
3,Beautiful but with caution,"A very gorgeous book with inspiring pictures but the recipes given and techniques used should be for experienced soapmakers only. All the recipes are extremely lye heavy when run through a lye calculator. In addition, the botanicals used in the quantities stated require careful preservation and drying-I would not recommend curing in a humid enviroment. The fancy decorative aspect is neat but extremely useless and some downright painful-who would scrub their bodies with whole cloves-ouch! I have tried two of the recipes but modified to create a gentle product. We will see how it goes."
3,Not totally convinced!,"Not really convinced about some of the measurements;1.To much essential oil - makes the soap to overpowering .2.lye reccomendations to high; ive run them through an online lye calculater to discover that they are abit excessive,and im convinced this is why ive ended up a couple of times with white chunks in my soap.3.Alot of the food additives such as the Honey And oats are way to excessive in quantitys-I then found with time they went mouldy.Nice array of ideas , just needed abit more fine tuning than it actually had."
5,The Best of Marie's solo work!,I recommend this CD to everybody who likes thoughtful melodies and fantastic lyrics (you have to know Swedish though...). My biggest experience in music so far!
1,Horrible!,"The role of Armida, sung by Gasdia, is gargled the whole time! The Fleming and even the Callas (Live, 1952) are clearly superior. Gasdia lacks depth in her singing -- and has no sense of 'bel canto' and no sense of the musical line. They should rename 'bel canto' -- 'bel can't' -- just for her. Don't waist $20 buying this...buy the Fleming or the Callas -- both recordings are far superior -- with brilliant singing and real operatic drama."
3,ghosts from the distant past,"""Vanessa"" is built around a unique idea: survival of a Civil War ghost to the present-objective, revenge. Along with this theme go the ghosts of a group of Civil War soldiers, stuck in time. Attempting to resolve the contretemps with the collaboration of his great, great grandson is a man (not a ghost) who has survived and can see and communicate with ghosts due to a Navy experiment aimed at making ships invisible to radar (somewhat reminiscent of ""The Philadelphia Experiment""). The book's pace is leisurely, as the dialogue realistically deals quite a bit with day-to-day matters and interpersonal relationships. There is also a good deal of internal debate by the various characters. Since there are so many, a cast of characters at the end is helpful. The book is the first in a series of four."
5,Greatest Game Ever.,"this was quite possibly the best horror game ever made. SH2 has some of the greatest graphics ive ever seen, except for SH3...the effects the noises and characters have on you are stunning, and the creatures startlingly real. Pyramid Head provides the greatest entertainment, since he wears a doctor's trench, stained brown and red (O_o), wearing steel toed boots, white gloves, and carries around a great knife (or a spear, ""pokey stick"" as my friend and i like to call it!) But probably the most interesting thing i find about Pyramid Head is...well, his head....heh heh. A giant red steel pyramid just plopped up on there. You might even go as far as saying that he's sexy...if you want to see for yourself, ..."
2,Did Not Work Well On My PC,"When I would start the game, sometimes I would get a blue squeen and have to power down and start over. Sometimes the people in the game had no sound only words to read what they were saying. My PC has a AMD 64 Dual Core Prosser and 2 gigs of ram..."
1,Avoid this.,"The gameplay is the worst I have ever experienced. That is what totally ruins the game. I had to use the gamepad since there is no mouse control. And the reason why I purchased the game for the PC instead of the Playstation was to use the mouse. Anyway the control is terrible with the gamepad. The character does not point in the direction of the joystick movement, making it a pain to navigate. I made the mistake of purchasing this game based on reviews. I played this game for about 20 minutes before calling it quits."
4,something different,"This game is all about storyline and characters. The graphics and gameplay are pitiful compared to many shooters. The environment is somewhat interesting. The puzzles are fun to figure out. I'm disappointed in the sound effects and music; they could have done better. I wish the camera angle was always behind the character, like a standard third-person game, instead of constantly switching around -front, back, side."
3,"So, what's it like? Well...","...try to imagine slogging your way through a Marilyn Manson music video, at night, with the fog machine turned up. *Way* up. Only the music isn't Marilyn Manson (more's the pity), but a mishmash of semi-creepy ""theme"" music and some hack's electric guitars.There's plenty of hack and slash in this game, mostly because there aren't many guns and ammo is limited. Hand-to-hand combat (mostly with a big stick or a steel pipe) is the order of the day (or night, whatever). You'll thank your lucky stars for the map feature, since it's easy to get lost in this burned-out burg, and there's plenty of creepy-crawlies around. Thankfully, you can easily dodge most of them and focus on the battles you really *have* to fight.This game kind of wears out its' welcome after you've beaten it two or three times, so get it cheap or just rent it. Otherwise you're better off with anything from the ""Resident Evil"" series, or ""Silent Hill"" 3 or 4."
5,Is one of the best games I ever played,"This game is exelent, is the most scary game I ever Played. Resident Evil is so bored compared to this game. This game was made by Konami the best company of Games Ever. Good graphics exelent music and a story that maintein's you in a mysterious world. ..."
1,incompatibility blues,"this game (commonly) won't run in xp with ati cards. a driver problem i guess; prevented me from running it under bootcamp =(apparently it likes nvidea cards (google search) but it wouldn't run on my vista laptop either that has this card (maybe it doesn't like vista?)anyway, some older games like this need to either be revised to run properly on new pc's or just go away. i'm bummed after reading the great reviews -- but buyer beware regarding pc compatibility"
5,One of the best games of Silent Hill,"This game truly rocks!!. I love the game play which is smooth and you can use the analog..for the first time in Silent Hill history...no more sloppy. This game has killer 3D graphics and in my view its better than the first and i think in my view too, its better than Silent Hill 3 to be honest (very sorry if anybody disagrees; dont believe me!..try playing both side by side and you'll see the differance between the two; graphic wise and playing wise). Anyways, this game should be with your PS2 game shelf..its that good!. Worth the time and the money."
4,Gives You the Whim-Whams,"Extremely atmospheric and creepy (the indecipherable whispering coming from behind your right ear and moving around....brrrrr, especially at 2 in the morning, home alone with the lights off), very rich graphics, and beautiful music/sound. There are is one annoying oddity with the graphics though, and this might just be me, but the stray sliver of light behind you all the time when you have the flashlight on. About the only thing keeping this from a 5-star rating is the GODAWFUL --I repeat, GODAWFUL-- voice-acting (it's right up there with ""Freelancer""; it almost makes you feel embarrassed for them), the finger-knotting controls (eventually you get the knack, but still...), and the camera which is not very intuitive at all. But definitely a great game and well worth the $."
3,"Ditch the extremes, go Arminian....","Calvinism is a response to Catholicism and their view of free will (libertarian). Arminianism was a response and critique of Calvinism. Open theism takes Arminianism to a (dangerous?) extreme.Thus, the two extremes on the spectrum are wanting. Stick with the balanced middle position... Arminianism."
3,Delicious but be careful,Delicious but be careful - we found a small stone in it for the third time..very tasty besides the stones that almost made us break our teeth
2,Poor quality.,The film quality looks like someone stood in the back of a theater twenty five years ago with a video camera and taped it.
4,MUSIC MAN,"This album/cd leaves out a very special song from Maureen McGovern. It is called We could have it all again. It was a great tune, never been made avaiable on cd. Just goes to show you why illegal downloading music sites continue to thrive, as i picked a copy of this tune up on one of the sites. Greed on the record companies part continues to kill their sales. Why could this song not have been included on this compilation????"
4,Pretty Good But Still Awaiting The Morning After Disc,"Pretty good selection here(showcasing Maureen's beautiful voice)of her first decade releases(but agree with other posts that ""We May Never Love Like This Again""(from disaster flick ""The Towering Inferno"") should have been included here). More important, awaiting the curent owners of 20th Century Records to re-release her breakthru disc ""The Morning After""(1973). Keeping my fingers crossed!"
3,"Great, but not her greatest",How come 2 of Maureen Mcgovern's great songs like We may never love like this again(from the movie The Towering Inferno) and We could have it all are not included in this album?
3,A lesson in how a record company can squander talent.,"I bought this album for ""Can You Read My Mind"" and ""The Morning After"". OK, yes, and for the theme from 'Angie'! It's worth it for those tracks. Listening to the other tracks, I wondered what the studio execs were thinking. They obviously didn't know what to do with this incredible voice. I'm so pleased that Ms. McGovern was later able to establish herself as a peerless interpreter of Gershwin and popular standards."
4,Great Voice,"In this collection of Maureen Mcgovern songs, we are presented with only a handful of songs that showcases her voice. What is missing here is the song from 'The Towering Inferno' which became of her biggest hits. Ms.McGovern has come a long way now and very much prominent in the musical theatre genre and this early complilation features songs from the 1970 and early 80's.This is very much a sampler of her talents. I do enjoy the songs but try her other albums which are just simply fab!"
4,onward,Alfie Boe is so very talented and versatile----love all his work. I look forward to any new recordings he may make
2,Carry a Tune?,"While Pavement has merit, has anybody noticed that their singer can't sing. He can't carry a tune. His voice constantly breaks. Listen to him sing REM's Camera and then compare to Michael Stipe's singing on the original.Like all albums on Amazon, the reviews for this album are consistently raves, as only huge fans typically take the time to write reviews."
5,Classic,Simply put this is one of the best rock albums your likely to find. One of my alltime favorites and the extras are just the icing on the cake. So get your cake and eat it up.
3,Is this how they intended CRCR?,"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain is one of my favorite records of all time. So I picked this up as soon as I had the chance. The remastered album sounds prettty good...some modest improvements, but nothing earthshattering. As for the rest of the package, I can't really be too complimentary. Sure, we get some nice b sides, but these countless scores of crappy demos??? Come on, Matador. Do we really need these on the ""definitive"" edition of one of the greatest records from the 90s? There's a reason that these versions didn't wind up on the album. I can only guess that the label intends to rerelease every Pavement album as a ""remastered"" double disc to make fans buy them twice, and that's gonna mean a lot of filler. It's nice to get to hear some unreleased stuff, but I must admit that a little of this album's power will be lost to new fans as a result of this package."
3,Enough with the bloated praise...,"Up to this album Pavement were incredible. Slanted & Enchanted lived up to the hype heaped on it by the English music press back in '92; an absolutely stunning and perfect album. The Westing comp was chock full of unremittingly genius lo-fi gems as well.So there I was back in '94 or whenever, psyched up for the new Pavement album, and went out and got ""Crooked Rain"" right when it came out. Well, I have to admit I was disappointed, and my opinion of this album hasn't improved in the intervening years. ""Crooked Rain"" is an averagely good indie-college rock album. That's it, no more, no less. It's got some pretty good songs, but they're nowhere near enough to propel the album to the realms of greatness attributed to it. I know a lot of people love this album, and those are usually fans of indie-college rock music, which is what this album epitomizes."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!,"I borrowed this book from a friend. It was so good I had to find a copy for myself. If you want to grow in your spiritual life, read this book."
2,Covercraft car cover,"The car cover is a fantastic product for about 8 months. My car is stored outside all year long and the California sun delivered an early death to my cover. The elastic wore out and so did all of the advertised qualities. It did not repel water or dust, it just became a huge absorbent towel for my corvette. Hang on to your receipt Covercraft does not honor the warranty Amazon does. I will say that dealing with Amazon for a replacement was very painless. I plan on getting a replacement every 8 months for the duration of the 4 year warranty."
2,Unexpected (Not Good) Results,"Well the book is written to a teacher so it's very general ,in the way it dosen't have many details. SO, it'll be like we had a great date at the park. But what did they do at the park? And the connection between the girl and the boy dosen't seem very strong to end up where they end up at the end of the book. It's an OK book, but nothing special."
3,Do NOT expect the full Bible,"The recording is fine and the reader's voice is excellent. My only problem was I thought it meant both Old AND New Testaments, so it was not the bargain I thought when I ordered it."
4,If not for the motion sickness...,"This game has great graphics, and is not so challenging that it takes all the fun out of it. However, I cannot play it without getting nauseous. And I'm talking REALLY sick here! It does NOT do that to my kids, though, and since that is who the game was for, that's a good thing. There's nothing objectionable in the game, either, in my opinion. You do have to beat up bugs that try to attack you, but it's not bloody, which is a good thing for the younger kids who like the ""action."" If not for the motion sickness, I'd give it 5 stars."
3,Glitch-ridden insect adventure,"As you may have heard, I am a longtime supporter of Pangea Software. I decided to pick up this game after playing the demo and hearing all the acclaim it recieved, and was expecting just that. Unfortunately, I feel the game doesn't really belong on Windows. There is no hiding that Bugdom is cute and innocent fun, but by the third level, technical issues will be popping out over your shoulder. The framerate often lags, especially in the eighth level, the night field, and the game can often become infinitely frustrating because of these reasons as well as the overabundance of enemies in certain levels. Also, some of the later levels feel rushed and short, including the three bosses as well as the penultimate level. Bugdom is fun at first, but such hardware was clearly not designed for this computer. If I were you, I would buy the Mac version. Even though I have yet to play it, it looks better from what I've seen."
4,very good,"I am reading the Joanna BVrady series and Shoot don't shoot was a good one. It shows her progress as a law inforcement officer. I also like the realistic ""battles"" between mother and daughter. Been there, done that and have the gray hair to show for it."
4,shoot,"Sheriff Brady learns more about how to be a law enforcement officer, despite the Neanderthal instructor at the Arizona police academy. She has to put the information to immediate use, with a case she brought with her to metro Phoenix from Cochise County. Joanna also learns a shocking secret about her family. I'm sure her reactions to the news will develop further in later books in the series, along with a possible new relationship. Her daughter seems to start to recover from the loss of her father 2 months before. For example she reached out to help a friend who also had lost a parent.This or the previous book, Tombstone Courage, would be good places to begin reading the series. I wouldn't start any later than these.If you want 100% action with little character development, this isn't the series for you."
1,"Very trashy, did not finish reading","I have enjoyed other books by this author, but this one was trashy. I turned it back in. I would not recommend this book."
4,A very rewarding continuation of Joanna Brady'sfirst few weeks as sherrif.,"I find it interesting that the first three Joanna Brady books cover a time span of nly about three months. So I do recommend reading them in consecutive order. While taking a ccourse targetted for those new in law enforcement, she becomes involved in a case of what appears to be the product of domestic violence and is outside her jurisdiction. I was glad to find that the relationship between Brady and the investigating officers doesn't follow the predictable pattern one would expect. As usual with J. A. Jance, Joanna's personal life as a newly widowed mother is nicely balanced with the mystery plot. However, I found the resolution a bit lacking and outside what I consider the basic rules of mystery writing.However, this is an entertainng and worthwhile read."
4,Choices,"Going to back to school is murder, especially for Joanna Brady. A favorite lady sheriff heads to Phoenix to learn the tools of her trade so she won't feel inferior to her employees. While in class she befriends the only other woman in the class. Phoenix isn't Cochise County so Joanna is without jurisdiction as she investigates a serial killer and is stalked herself.Fast paced with multiple subplots, Joanna finds a new friend in bar owner, Butch Dixon. This may not be the best time in her life with the recent death of her husband, but maybe for the future.Ploddy at times but J.A. Jance's story-telling power pulls it through to an exciting conclusion.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County Novel"
3,Terror at the police academy,New sherriff Joanna Brady finds terror at the Arizona Police Officer Academy. She must solve multiple homicides before she becomes a victim. Will she live? Hint: there are more books to come. This is not a whodunit. The reader will not know the killer's identity until our hero finds him.
1,Forget the Audio Book...Read the Book Instead,"Like all the Joanna Brady series, Shoot/Don't Shoot is full of interesting, multi-dimensional characters, intriguing, exciting, and overloaded with side plots. The audio version by Ellen Travolta, however, is ineptly read. She has a good voice but seems to have just picked up the book and started reading with no preparation. The phrasing is stumbling, and she even stutters occasionally. The mispronunciations of place names, surnames and even ordinary words are so bad and so frequent as to be distracting. Save your money and read the book if you can."
4,Solid investigative novel set in Arizona,Chose this as part of vacation reading while on holiday in Scottsdale and was not disappointed. Very fast read and one of those situations you can believe really happens. Sets the scene in the Phoenix area beautifully and you get to know all the characters quite well. Action is fast paced and found it successfully resolved. Will go for more in this series. Thought Joanna Brady to be a worthy protagonist.
4,shoot out,"I read one of the series much later books and realized I didn't know the background of the characters. I decided to start at the beginning and read all the previous books. It helped flesh out the people involved. I like them because Sheriff Brady is not an instant hero. She's struggling to find her way, as a widow, single mom and sheriff all at the same time. The Arizona setting brings different elements than most police dramas."
1,Horrible! Don't Waste Your Time With This Book! Worth 0 *'s,"If any book deserves negative stars, this one does! And that's what I wish I could give it!It is disgusting and pointless. Rude and crude and contains inflencial, wrong concepts and ideas that will win over those who are weak-minded.Don't waste your time with it. Move on to something else.HORRIBLE!HORRIBLE!HORRIBLE!HORRIBLE!HORRIBLE!HORRIBLE!HORRIBLE!"
4,Excellent sporting goods market,"Sports marketing company with excellent responsibility to deliver and to deliver products bought in your store the place of destination, 100% secure and very reliable. They have a variety of sporting goods covering most of the expectations of the people who love sport and s any specific practice. They are a shop in which the client admires the quality of their products.Congratulations![...]"
4,Great characters and a fun story,"With four female characters that are vastly different from one another (one engaged, one divorced, one single, one older), I loved the way the story looked at the different ways each woman figured things out for herself. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't some soul-searching novel about women coming to terms with earth-shattering issues, but it was both funny and thoughtful at the same time.I'll admit, I am one of those ""thirty somethings"" who enjoys reading about women in all their incarnations, and the smart/absurd/ridiculous/human things they do as they figure out life. And that's exactly what Dress Rehearsal was for me - a fast, fun read with enjoyable characters who made me laugh and cringe and hoped they got out of their own way long enough to find what they were looking for."
4,A solid second book,"Having read and loved Ms. O'Connell's first book, I bought this one as soon as it came out, so excited to read it! I wasn't disappointed with it, though I still think ""Bachelorette #1"" is better because of its unique concept.""Dress Rehearsal"" focuses on Lauren as she runs her famous bakery. I liked the relationship she has with her friends and with her coworkers, but the plot was a tad predictable with how it was going to end. The route taken to the end, however, makes it worth reading, as there are a number of twists and turns you don't expect. It's well written and you can both cringe and laugh as Lauren does stuff that you want to tell her not to do.Definitely written for women, and I think most women would probably enjoy this. I'd recommend reading ""Bachelorette #1"" first and if you enjoy that (and you will), then read ""Dress Rehearsal!"""
4,ADORABLE!!,"This book was a really cute beach read (or anytime read!). It was light, you could identify with the characters, and you felt that you really got to know them. Lauren is a very good heroine. The only problem character to me was Maria, Lauren's chief baker at the ""boutique"". She was very nosy and abrasive. I guess it worked out for the story, but even in the end, I didn't like her."
1,"dry writing, annoying protagonist","i am sorry i guess i just can't get into a protagonist that fixates on trying to ""steal"" another girl's fiance. i understand neil was ""hers"" first but come on, grow up. it just didn't seem like lauren had a life. her friends were slightly more interesting, but overall i found the writing style of this book to be dry and kind of bland and unengaging. maybe it was just me."
3,Another average book,"This is yet another entry into the chick lit genre. Its amazing how much of this stuff is out there and how much of it is just average.I had not really liked this author's previous book, but I thought this one sounded promising.The whole wedding thing is so overdone in chick lit. Especially the whole ""all my friends are getting married and I am happy to help them with that, but I AM NOT interested in finding a man myself"".This book never actually gets started. The author has a lot to say, but never gets anywhere.Also, what is with the tiny, tiny writing? I was pulling out my eyes to read this stuff.Average at best (and I am being kind)."
2,Disjointed,"Using the type of wedding cake a couple orders may be a strange way to determine the solidity of their union, but it has worked well enough for Lauren Gallagher to have a flourishing business. She wishes that her accuracy was a bit off though when her radar tells her that her best friend is heading for diseaster, just when she is having some sparks in her own love life. Trying to divide her attention between romance, saving her friend, and running the business during a crisis makes life chaotic.** This chaos and rather disjointed quality makes the brevity of the book a blessing. **"
4,Worth reading!,"Dress Rehearsal is among the better chick lit books I've read. The main character and her friends were successful, smart, fairly strong characters -- unlike most chick lit books where the main character is totally pathetic in the beginning. Also, there was enough going on where I honestly didn't know what was going to happen -- unlike most books where I can guess the ending by the third page. I wouldn't suggest Dress Rehearsal for my book club (I wouldn't suggest any chick lit books), but it's definitely a fun read and well written."
4,"Great value, ""so-so"" quality","I was surprised by the thinness of the tubing and the lack-of-weight of the bar. This doesn't really impact function as a light bar, I had just expected it to be more substantial. Great value, but don't push cars out of the way with this bar!"
5,Wonderful Piece for the price,"This is a huge bull bar for the money, I will defenatly give five stars, Mounting brackets are seperate, but still less than 160.00 all together"
2,Hopelessly outdated psuedo-science,"This book may expand and seem to give legitimacy to many ""impressions"" of Japanese people that you may have dealt with. Please don't be fooled. In the tradition of many ""how to deal wih the Japanese"" books that came out in the '80's during the Japanese economic boom, it is a collection of half-truths and generalizations based on anectodes and folktales rather than any hard evidence.And, for the record, most Japanese businessmen I know think that ""Haragei"" involves drawing a face on your tummy."
4,Sufficient,I bought this from KV Pet through Amazon and received it via ups on its due date. It was packaged well. Therr was nothing wrong with the bottle. I filled it as instructed and have not seen any excess dripping. Great for my chinchilla.
3,Rubber ring inside cap gets worn,Pro: The bottle is made of glass. No plastic toxin leaking into the water.Con: The rubber ring inside the cap becomes deformed after a few months of use. So the bottle leaks if the cap isn't carefully screwed on.
4,good quality,It's durable and it's working good. I use it for my daughter's 2 gerbils and it takes quite a long time before refilling it. The quality of the glass bottle is good. I like it. The feeding end of the bottle is really chew proof.
5,Great Charm,"This is a great charm, sterling silver, good detail, I made a necklace and a set of earrings from them."
1,Prison Etiquette: The Convict's Compendium of Useful Information,"A completely out of date book on prison life. Written mostly by self-congratulating, World War 2 nonreligious conscientious objectors. Contains very little usefull information."
3,"Way Too Short, But Yes, SWEET","Although the 'Doonesbury' strip was only about a quarter of its present age when this film was made, I think it was definitely epic enough to have warranted a full hour. That being said, it was enough real Doonesbury to make you want more. Worth a watch, but you'll want to have plenty of books on hand to fulfill the craving for more Zonker, Mike, BD, and the gang that this video will leave you drooling with."
2,Curiosity value,"As a longtime Doonsbury fan I found this to be a strange experience. The only words I can think of to describe it are ""surreal"" and ""hollow"", sort of like the last episode of Seinfeld. It is also remeniscent of ""Fritz the Cat"", another piece of 70s animation/commentary that has not aged well."
4,Good folk music with some pizzazz,"I remember this album on vinyl in the 70's. It was hard to find even then, and I'm glad to see it released on CD. Forget that Fripp, Jon Anderson, Peter Gabriel, Rick Wakeman etc participated; their contributions are minimal. You do hear Fripp's guitar in parts, and Wakeman too, but don't buy it just for the big names. Buy it because it's good folk music: profoundly sad at times and a great celebration at others. It's a little uneven - hence the 4 stars - but I recommend it. The bonus tracks are, in my opinion, no great addition to the original."
4,Nice game like old RPGs,I love RPGs and this game is a game that reminds me of typical RPGs with great graphics used by the PS3
2,Complicated fight system,"The story line seems to be good, but the fighting system its too tactical and complicated, about graphics, they are good but not for what a PS3 it is capable of."
1,Terrible game,"This game has bad graphics, bad music, and bad gameplay. The voice acting is horrible! The characters are horrible! Additionally, the font they use in this game is too thin and blurry to be seen clearly on a medium sized television.The only positive feature that this game does have is smooth controls. Beyond that, I can only say that the graphics are better in game, such as when you are walking around the city or in combat than in the stills and conversations, though not up to the level where I could identify it as a next gen game. The graphics for the conversations, some of the cutscenes, stills, ect. are much worse. They are extremely bad looking.Avoid this game at all costs."
3,Good value for $20. Game improves after first hour.,"The main thing that Enchanted Arms is guilty of is having a slow intro and an obnoxious character. I found myself frowning for the first 1-2 hours of this game, but then enjoyed it greatly after that. The majority of the poor ratings this game has gotten come from people who played it 15-30 minutes. Don't trust those reviews.Graphics - Graphics are mediocre for next-gen, but look good if you are coming from a PS2.Sound - Decent voice acting for the most part, typical RPG music fare.Gameplay - Deep battle system requires much thought and planning, each individual battle feels like a fast paced Tactics battle. I recommend this game based on gameplay and battle systme alone.Is this game great? Probably not. But for 20$ it fills the gap of RPG's that the next-gen systems are currently feeling."
4,This game is not so bad at all,"I actually enjoyed this game. The storyline was pretty deep and interesting. The battle system had a lot of faults but what game in the rpg world has been perfect. There is a lot to do in this game and although many people are complaining about the back tracking, I remember the days when we had no choice but to backtrack. I think the back tracking is sometimes really good for building up your characters levels. I will say some of the bosses are extremely difficult, but if you train your characters to a level above what it is suppose to be, you will be fine. If anyone is a fan of rpg's, then I believe you will appreciate this one. It's not the best, but it is certainly not the worse."
1,Homophobic garbage,Title says it all! This game should be banned.The characters are some of the worst I've ever seen. and it's homophobic with how they portray things.
1,Gag me with a spoon,"Without wasting my breath on something so not worth it's time... let me say this game stinks to high heaven and warn you DO NOT BUY IT! It is god awful need I say more.It takes on a Final Fantasy feeling but is full of transvestite under tones, also one of your characters is a full out flamer. It feels like a cheesy and i mean CHEESY anime full of senseless head smacking jokes that leave you with a headache and a dullness that I cannot even grab at the words at this time.Please for your own sake rent this or something before you lay down 50 bucks on it. I bought it before any comments were on the site because the graphics looked good and boy did I waste my money on this."
4,Enchanted Arms,"Enchanted ArmsIt almost gives you the feel of a Final Fantasy game, but a whole lot easier. If you are a gamer playing a RPG for the first time, then that will greatly help you."
4,For more than just the horse lovers,"The people Mr. McClelland meets and shares losses and wins with in this novel are very different people that are drawn together by one thing: the day they will score that big win. Most of these people have already gotten that big win and are hoping for another while the rest are trying to get their first but no matter what, you're going to lose money as a horse player. I am a young adult who at first saw this and was turned off because of my lack of interest in horse racing. You don't have to love horse racing to love this book--it isn't a bunch of statistics. This book is about people, people who will surprise you with their passion (or addiction) to just keep playing. I hope this review helped you and if not I am sorry."
5,Gritty look at the gambling game of horse racing.,"I have read my share of horse racing books but none as entertaining as Ted McClelland's Horseplayers. The book follows McClelland ups and downs in 2003. He spends a year playing the races. Of course this isn't just his story but the story of lots of other folks that cross his path as he primarily plays the Chicago race circuit. If you are looking for a ""how to"" book this isn't the one. In fact you might say it is more of a ""how not to"" book. You see some winners but more losers. If you are player you might well see yourself."
4,Entertaining,"I found myself enjoying the details as I prep my own bets on the Belmont. He's got a knack for meeting interesting people and sharing something significant with them. And gives good descriptions of the tracks he visits and what it's like to wait, bet and watch horse races through the seasons. I imagine betting has changed with the advent of online betting but a day at the races is still just that and well described in this book. He gives many betting insights he's learned from others. I find myself referring back to it after betting, win or lose. Good lessons, good writing, interesting people."
2,Disappointment,"I thought this book was about real horseplayers. You know, the 5% winners that we all here about. I was really looking forward to learn what the big time players do. NOT ! This book was more about which race track has the worst hot dogs and sleaziest people.The new book, ""SIX SECRETS OF SUCCESSFUL BETTORS"" is much more of what I was looking for. ""Horseplayers"" is not for serious players. Can't recommend."
4,satisfying product,"I have yet to try these panties at an event, but they seem to do the trick. They keep my tummy flat and firm, only ""problem"" is how the pantieline in the front makes my thighs bulge out a little, which dosen't make it convenient underneath tight pants. For me anyways.."
4,All We Know Is That Paramore Is Awesome!,"This is definitely a good first effort on Paramore's part, especially considering that they had a big line-up change within the band during and right after the album was recorded. It definitely showcases well what they are all about and it's easy to see why they have evolved into the band they are today. I definitely recommend this album to all Paramore lovers out there."
4,Very good album from a very young band!,"What a great album from this young band! The songs are not as catchy as some other commercial bands but if you give them 2-3 listens they will stick to your head like glue!The singer is only 17 years old but has an awesome and powerful voice that fits right into the music.All in all, a great album and I cant wait for the band's next cd!Fav tracks:All we know, Pressure, Brighter, Here we go again."
5,Paramore Rocks with their first album,If your a fan you gotta check their first album out. You will not be disappointed.
5,Awesome,"This CD is amazing. I love Paramore and I have all of their CD's. Bottom line, get the CD. You won't regret it."
3,All we know...,"All we know is falling is a decent cd. I'm not quite sure it's worth the 14 dollars but it isn't that bad.The only way I can think of describing the songs on this cd is like taking butter and churning it. Yeah, it's a weird description but that's what it reminds me of... it's like, thick.Haley has a great voice to listen to and considering they're aren't very many bands in the whole emo scene with female vocals, this is something new and better to listen to. It's not whiny rock, but don't expect loud guitars and screaming.. it's a really mellow cd.Although the songs tend to blend together after a while, the last song has great lyrics and really stands out. I loved it.If you're a fan of Jamisonparker or the forecast you'll more than likely love the cd."
5,Paramore is the best band in the world and this CD The best!!,Well i didn't get this CD as soon as it came out i got riot first and RIOT! was amazing... this CD was also amazing and i can't stop listening to it i mean come on this is one of the best CDs known to earth and once you start listening to it you really can't stop listening to it! For all of who write bad reviews stay of the page!! Like i said this CD is amazing!!
2,"Milquetoast, serviceable debut","Serviceable debut and example of the watered down emo-pop punk showered upon the masses by A&R as the new alternative sound. To their credit, they've refined their sound over time, with Brand New Eyes their best yet, and the attention less just the hype about Hayley Williams, and more about the overall band. Much better outlook, than say, Fall out Boy, who have hit a bit of creative rut."
1,My Ears consider this Objectionable,"This is hands down one of the worst albums I have ever listened to. I've given it several chances, spaced out so I wasn't formulating any rash opinions. The production on the album is very flawed since they could have certainly revved the album up a bit. The guitar work sounds very pedestrian and generic. If you've ever listened to albums not known for guitars (i.e. albums like Mos Def's The New Danger) you'll know what I mean. All the same chords used ad nauseum. Hayley Williams initially comes across as talented, but once you actually listen to a full song you realize she can only pull off a short burst of notes. She has charisma, but there are plenty of singers out there that have charisma and that can actually sing well. But the worst part of the album are the lyrics themselves. They are dreadful and sound like a cheap garageband. If you are 15 you might like this. If you've developed some tastes stay away."
1,How...uninspired,"With the exception of ~*Pressure*~ and the title track, each one of these songs have N-O personality. Boring, watered down emo crap to fall asleep to, if you can even stand to obvious boredom in hailey ""tennesse"" williams' voice. what happened to the kick ass days of pop-punk? why does every band feel the need to throw in one slow song after another? What a snooze. If you like any of the good pop-punk left (like cartel, fall out boy, houston calls ect.), I'd steer clear of this crap. Just another ""emo"" band that'll be here and gone in less than a year."
4,PRESSURE,"I HAVENT HEARD THIS WHOLE CD.....but ""pressure"" is a kick ass song and I love it. Im listening to it now, been listening to it, and will continue to listen to it until i leave to purchase the ablum. If it suxs, trust me, i will return and correct this review. lets hope it doesnt come to that. lol."
4,Good Stuff,"I had actually bought Paramore's other two albums, ""Brand New Eyes"" and ""Riot!"" before I purchased this one. Obviously I liked what I had heard with their other two albums, so I thought I would give this one a shot. Honestly I prefer ""Riot!"" and ""Brand New Eyes"" to this one, but that doesn't mean this isn't a great album. It has a punk sound that you can get pretty pumped about and catchy tunes like ""Emergency"" and ""Pressure"" that will keep you coming back. You can tell Paramore was really trying to find their sound with this album and clearly they did otherwise they wouldn't have been propelled to super-stardom. If you're a fan of punk music or just a big Paramore fan (like I am), then this one is definitely worth a buy."
3,Who is to blame?,"This book may be right in several respects, but then people like Ziauddin Sardar themselves belong to parasite third world ruling elites that serve Western ""interests"" in such countries. If it weren't for this class and its hypocrisy and sheer greed, the West would have a very hard time in enabling its ""interests"" over here. So, who is to blame?"
1,Don't go there,No brass on it anymore. Just a wood plank for $72 and cheap plastic knobs -- which arrived broken in transit. Shame -- it looks like it was originally a nice office piece.
4,"If Horatio Alger had written a gay hustler novel, this would be it","Originally published in 1964, and updated for this 1986 edition, this novel is a seamy, formulaic novel about Rick, the small town boy who migrates to New York and becomes an in-demand hustler based on his good looks and size of his talent. Seamy and formulaic are used as adjectives here in a non-judgmental way: ""Naked to the Night"" is entertaining and a lot of fun. In the tradition of the paperback pulp novels, this book is an important link in the evolution of gay literature, even though the characterizations are thin and stereotypically constructed."
3,A little bit predictable...,"I had never read Sharon Mitchell before so I decided to get this book when I couldn't find the prequel to it.I really like her writing style and the story was interesting but I could pretty much guess what was gonna happen before it happened.There was on twist in the story that I did not predict AT ALL and that was exciting.Overall, it was a good read but I wish it wasn't so predictable."
2,"""B""OOORING","Hmmm! I noticed that many of reviewers gave ""Near Perfect"" a good rating. I don't know if they read the same novel I read because this book was no where near good. It was BOOORING. It took me six weeks to read this laborous read. The only reason I endured the entire novel was due to my policy to finish any novels I begin. In my opinion, the storyline was wavering. One minute its about Jamal and Roxy then Jamal suddenly dies and Link discovers his overwhelming love for Roxy all of a sudden (eventhough he has know her for twenty plus years). This novel ""only"" gets interesting in the last seventy-five pages. I kid you not. This is a novel not worth reading they are to many other things to do."
4,"Not cheap, but solid.","I wanted a more see-through box to store my yarn, so I could see what's in each box. Most containers like this are more opaque and not helpful. These are a tiny bit ""frosted"" but not overly, so I can see the colors of the skeins. The lids lock well - if you don't overfill them! I did initially, so I got a few more. :)"
5,The best introduction to the IQ controversy,"While I don't agree with Seligman on everything, this is far and away the best introduction for the general reader to the enormous literature of the IQ controversy. It's superbly readable, and, amazingly enough in this age of bloated books, short.Steve Sailer"
4,Excellent no nonsense book!,"This book lays out the details of IQ's relationship to the real world in a clear concise and amusing form. Daniel Seligman (from Forbes) has a gift for keeping it readable and engaging.It should be noted that this book doesnt hedge with the usual overly strained qualifications about I.Q. What I mean is if the bulk of the scientific literature on the topic supports a conclusion, daniel reports it as such without making massive unwarranted qualifications so as to remain politically correct or not to disturb certain groups.The only (necessary) downside is a foray into what were considred Hoaxes in the literature (The Burt Affair). These are necessarily boring but the author makes a fair attempt to keep it interesting. Which is why 4 stars.Overall, a great introduction to the real world applications of intelligence and psychometrics for people who do not wish to go in-depth into the topic like ""The Bell Curve"" book did."
4,Reddish Color,"The shoes are cute and comfortable (I bought them in wide for my wide feet.). The color is nice but I've never seen a coffee bean this reddish in color (coffee bean brown). They are nice, nevertheless."
5,Excellent Product!,"This is one of the most useful things that I carry. It is always on my key ring and I frequently use it. Of course it's a compromise as a tool. Even compared to a small multi tool. But very few multi tools will fit unobtrusively on a set of keys. The screw drivers are decent sized for small jobs. It has 1/4 inch hash marks on the side which are sometimes useful. It is supposed to cut wire, but it isn't very effective at it. The pliers though, are the best feature. Obviously you wouldn't want to turn a bolt with them, but there are many times when a small pair of pliers is all you need. If it had a small knife blade, it would be near perfect."
2,Useless,There are definitely better key rings out there if you just want to use it as a key ring. It is difficult to use this product as intended.. it being very small to handle. People with small hands might still find it handy but people with large or even medium hands would find it difficult to handle.The coating on top wears out after medium usage and the groves do not really fit in places it should actually do. Overall NOT a recommended buy.
4,solid lock box,"For the price this is a great lock box. The mounting plate is awesome because i can just pop the two metal clips inside and take my lock box with me but also securely mount it to the floor. The construction is rugged and the whole lock box is very sturdy. It has a outboard plug in jack for power, and the batteries are pretty easy to mount(I have no idea what the other guy is talking about). The only reason why i gave it 4 stars is the lame shelf it comes with and the carry handle, i thought the manufacturer could of put more effort into those two pieces. Great purchase overall, key response is outstanding and it's DoJ approved for stalifornia."
4,Worth it,"The husband's review: The safe is priced well and has functioned flawlessly since I purchased it about 8 months ago. I also have a Gunvault brand safe. Both function well to keep little hands away from firearms, but this unit is larger, less expensive and seems more sturdy. It is tall so it'll likely not fit under most beds but the size allows it to hold three of my handguns, two of which are holstered. The inside shelf is flimsy and, though it hasn't failed yet, I wish it were a little thicker (bows under weight), hence the 4 stars. That said I've been quite pleased with the product."
1,Not good,"I was impressed when I opened the box. Product was well built and sturdy. However, it was defective. It would not allow me to program in my opening code. I returned it for a refund as I had no confidence in the product and that another would perform properly. If I needed to get my gun in an emergency situation, I want something which operates reliably."
5,Superb book,Our students have related warmly to Visual Literacy. It has helped them understand the fundamentals of design. The exercises connect with the real world and they generate a lot of inspiring results.
2,Novel idea but flawed by its limited content,"Before buying this book you have to realise this is merely an exercise book. The amount of explanation or theory is extremely limited. And neither they elaborate on the student examples they chose for their book. Nor do they explain why some solutions might be better than others. The exercises itself could be more challenging, they really seem to be aimed at first year students. You will have to buy at least a book on graphic design principles/theory to put the exercises in this book into the right context. Nothing wrong with that, but they 'forgot' to mention all that on the back cover, so to speak.It's a nice idea, but its execution is flawed and way too limited to be the stroke of genious that some reviewers want you to believe."
3,It's a nice book in concept,"Yes, it has some good exercises for students. However, it was not what I expected because they did not really explain concepts and graphic principles along the way. Also, it would have been better to label this a guidebook and for it to be spiral-bounded to add to its ease of use.It only has a few exercises that are really good for a college-level class (a visual communications class)."
5,Richard Wilde and Visual Literacy,"As a sophomore advertising student in Richard's ""Visual Literacy"" class at SVA, I learned to see the hidden beauty of... just about everything. The assignments included were both artistically and intellectually stimulating; one project that I don't believe is included in the book was ""Point of View,"" in which he asks you to show one object from six different perspectives (not from different views, more from say... a mouse's perspective, your mother's perspective, the perspective of a giant). It was the perfect blend of creating and thinking, both outside of the box. Buy this book. Use this book. It is great for creative block, and more fun than kindergarten!"
5,Beautiful!! Reed & Barton Allora stainless is pure quality,"We've owned this for one year. After 18 years, we decided to replace our Oneida stainless. We shopped countless hours trying to find something as much as we loved our old stainless. We did - when we found the ALLORA line from Reed & Barton. It is so beautiful! It feels great in your hand. It's solid and heavy. The fork tines are not going to bend on you. This is pure quality. It was hard to find at first, but now we are finding it easier to come by. Some stores even carry open stock on some items. You won't be disappointed in this set."
4,A revealing light on the life of a writer and his muses,"This book, written with style and interest, is a sound ,balanced and well documented research on the lives and marriages of Ernst Hemingway with this four wives , Hadley Richardson (portayed in A Moveable Feast), Pauline Pfeiffer (Green Hills of Africa), Martha Gelhorn -a writer herself- (The fifth column) and Mary Welsh (A dangerous summer), inteligently ilustrated, amusing and covering also his famous lovers: Adriana Ivancich (his Renata in Across the river and under the trees) and Jane Kendall Mason (Brett Ashley herself in the Sun Also Rises) and the affairs that ended and started his marriages leaving a lasting pattern in his literature. It's an amusing and interesting book for those who love, hate or ignore Hemingway. It also explores his difficult and influencing relationship with his mother."
5,A good interesting read..,"I really enjoyed this book on many different levels. Following his travels from the 20s through the 50s presents a good review of history , while watching his personna develop with fame and fortune, gives an interesting look at the struggle within the creative process."
5,Great clipper,"I purchased this clipper to replace the old magnetic clipper I got over thirty years ago from Sears. This Fast Feed clipper, with its pivot motor, is much quieter. It does a great job of cutting hair. I purchased the 10-piece comb set, and kept the tapered ""left ear"" and ""right ear"" combs from the Sears clipper. Both kinds of combs fit this clipper perfectly. I also adjusted this clipper to trim closer to the skin on my neckline. It was easy: just a couple of minutes with a screwdriver. The clipper comes with a little tube of oil, but I've found 3-in-1 oil works just fine."
5,Excellent Product,"It was Half the cost at Amazon vs a beauty supply store!The clippers work great and are well worth the money.I did a lot of research on line and talking to local beauty suppy stores, this model is most recommended.They are lighter than the next model up, which makes them easier to use.I would recommend these hands down over any other product on the market today."
5,Close shave!,"I got these for my boyfriend for christmas and recieved them just in the nick of time. Of course I ordered them last-minute. He used them for the first time last week and his head looks worthy of a military gold star. He loves it, says it cuts like butter and doesn't snag or stall. I think it's a pretty good choice, we'll see if it passes the test of time. I'll update..."
4,GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!,"For about $60 I would think its a great deal, I think there is better product out there but I'm sure it will cost alot more. For now, I would still recommend it but not for everyday use."
5,Awesome,I love these clippers they are perfect for tapering and even fading i would recommend these clippers to anyone! Great Buy
5,Oster Fast Feed Clipper with Attachments,"The product works great. It arrived quickly and ready for use right out of the box. I used to cut my hair while in school and stopped because I enjoyed having somebody else do it for me. Lately, I assume because of the economy, my barber was not cutting as much of my hair as he used to in order to get me to come back more frequently. I bought these clippers in order to cut back on expenses. They were the best ones I could find on the market without moving up to a full blown professional model. First off, they were about 45% less expensive at Amazon than bricks and mortar stores and about 35% less than other web based businesses. They cut well. Have a nice heft to them and are comfortable to manipulate even for the back of my head where I cannot see. They paid for themselves after three uses! I don't ever intend to go back to a barber."
1,Wrong Listing,These clippers are listed under pet-dog clippers and they are not !!!!!! So misleading me into buying them and now I have to not only eat the cost in shipping them I have to eat the cost in returning them !!!!! Not good and Not happy !!!!!!
4,So far so good.,"So far so good, only used twice but they are very powerful. Claim will work when wet have not tried yet but I am skeptical and dont feel like punishing my clippers that should last me well in next six years. Comes with plenty of lube and believe me ill be using it! 10 times better than my previous remington, and 50 times better than my first Clarion Clippers, but you probably already knew that."
1,Extremely underwhelmed - throwing it in the bin,"Reading the reviews here, I'm stumped as to where all the praise is coming from. When I received these clippers, I expected to be in clipping heaven when I powered them up for the first time. When I actually did, I got a weak hum - weaker than my $25 clippers I bought at the local store.I have no idea why it's called 'Fast feed', as it isn't fast, and it doesn't 'feed' on anything. It was painfully slow in cutting my hair, requiring over 30 passes over each individual segment. It took me about an hour and a half to cut my hair with this thing. I was using the official Oster combs with it which were an absolute nightmare to fit on the device but I digress.These clippers are terrible. I'm going to throw them in the bin tomorrow, back to the cheapo clippers I suppose."
4,Good Clippers,"These clippers are very good and cut hair easily. The fast load attachments are an advantage and do speed up the hair cutting process. The only disadvantage is that the clippers do not cut hair down as short as I would like it. After cutting my hair, usually within about 3 days my hair has grown back in."
2,"Doesn't cut with power, constantly snagging","The clipper does not cut adequately, not sure if it is a design or power issue, but it is frequently snagging, so I have to take much longer to cut."
5,Gotta have.....,If you want to start cutting your hair at home this is a mut have. It powers through the thickest hair....
2,$50 better than $30,I had a $30 shaver from a local big box and this is better but not as good as a $100 pro model I had in the past. The problem is it misses fine hairs even when going over and over. the old expensive one did the job right the 1st time.
2,"pretty bad, for the money","plain and simply, it doesn't cut well. don't waste your money. go for a cheaper one that will work just as well (or better), or go for a better product that would be worth it."
2,Not great. Get a Wahl!,I am not impressed at all with these clippers. They cut poorly and the blade is set well back from the guide which makes for a shave which isnt as close as i would like. I have gone back to using my WAHLS for the most part and wont be buying another set of this brand anytime soon.
4,Oster Fast Feed Clipper,"PRO'S Made in the USA, not by the communist. Good quality.CON'S Does not come with a nice storage case. Lubricating oil leaks out of the bottle."
3,Under performed shaver,"For an Oster...this shaver lacks strength and power. It does shave OK, but so can a cheap $10 shaver...so Alexx (bald guy) said not worth the money.Not recommended."
3,Oster Fast Feed Clipper is okay.,"I purchased this clipper for my husband. He said it does not cut as close as other clippers he's used. It's decent, but not great!"
2,Not really the best clippers that I thought they were!,Never will I buy this clipper again. After a month of use all the guards became loose and made a loud rattling noise. It bothered my customers. It worked great before the situation with the guards. The guards would sometimes fall off meaning that they were loose. When the power is on the blade begins bumping into the guard making them very easy to slide out. Becareful if you're cutting someone else's or even your own hair when this happens.
4,Works better then battery operated clippers,Works well no battery fuss.Just plug it in an away go the whiskers.Buy this over other clippers you won't be sorry.
3,Not good for medium or smooth hair,"I'm usually one to never complain about something I bought, but this clipper is not good for normal hair. Yea it's sturdy and a solid clipper, but if you want a smooth, crisp, and a to-detail haircut, this is not for you. I thought this is what the average barber uses - they use andis i guess."
1,SPACERS ARE NOT GOOD !!!,"I bought this hair clipper thinking I was moving up in quality. I bought a Wahl hair clipper in 1973, used it almost 20 yrs. with no problem. It needed sharpening, but I bought another Wahl hair clipper instead. That one lasted approx. 18 yrs. with no problems. THEN! I bought this Oster hair clipper, and the 2nd time I used it, the spacer kept jumping off and then broke. I put another spacer on and it kept jumping off. NOT GOOD!I contacted them and did not get any help."
5,"""It works everytime.""","I've been using clippers for approximately 25 years. Oster, Wahl, Andis - really no complaints on any of these brands. Truth is, if you take care of your clippers, they should last a long time. But each brand (as well as model) has a tendency to mimic a specific personality. And as a result, it's effectiveness may largely depend on which personality best meshes with your process.This Oster Professional motor is quiet, and the pull through any type of hair is smooth. It's sharp, accurate, and the range on the adjustable blade is ideal. There's a bit a heft but it's not burdensome or obtrusive, making self-cutting an easier task.So if the loud, biting Wahl 305G MC is akin to (let's say) Chris Rock circa 1998, then the Oster Professional 76023 would be more like that cool cat you depend on to help you destroy the Empire...you know, a Billy Dee Williams-type."
1,Professional? Laughable.,"Just under a year ago my last hair clippers broke, so I looked around for a more durable alternative (the other set lasted about two years). I think I cut my hair all of four times with the Oster before the adjustable blade handle started becoming a little loose, but it was still useable. Well, it is no longer so. After the handle became looser over the last few months I finally decided to try and tighten the screw that holds the handle on the clipper. Well, that pretty much ended it. The handle now sways in the wind; the ""adjustable"" blade is now stationary. While the clippers still work, the idea that a ""professional grade"" machine would become dysfunctional after one person used it once a month for a year is pretty ridiculous.I selected this product because of what I'd read online, and the reviews. Hopefully my review will get some folks to reconsider and buy another item instead. I will not be buying Oster products in the future."
2,Noisy and doesn't trim cleanly,"I must say I am disappointed with this trimmer. It is very noisy with a strange vibration. I have used Oster trimmers before and the vibration is definitely unusual. Plus, it does not trim the sideburns all that well, missing some hairs - so I have to go over it with a shaver."
3,Miss leading information on attachments,The separate attachments that are listed with the Oster Pro 76023-510 will not work. They do not fit. These clip to the back of the clipper and the Oster Pro's attachments clip or slide into the sides of the clipper's head. It is clumsy to use with the heavy cord. I was not that happy with it.
3,Good for Basic Use,"I purchased this along with attachment kit several months ago. One thing you can't really tell by the picture is that it's very heavy and hard to maneuver even for most guys. It seems to be best suited for basic use, like giving someone a buzz cut. However, as a detailer, it's too wide to get around the ears. Also, the combs don't do a very good job. Even if you use all the attachments, it's not easy to get an even cut with this. If I could make another purchase, I would most likely go with the classic trimmer."
2,Save Your Money and Avoid Disappointment,"We had an old set of clippers from Wahl. We thought we needed to upgrade, as my wife gives our teenaged boys haircuts and I cut my own hair. If a ""professional"" used these ""professional"" clippers, he or she would soon be looking for a new line of work. Little power, a blade adjustment that didn't work properly...why the heck did I buy these things? Maybe Oster to stick to making blenders? Will be looking for the top grade Wahl model, as the old set lasted for years and countless haircuts. Lesson learned."
5,wow,"what a deal. I had been using some ""budget"" hair clippers for a while. I got myself a gift and I love these clippers. The best deal and best haircut yet. not so loud and they hold up too"
1,very poor product...,They won't cut--they just pulled hair out. Not much power..very disappointing.waste of money...I felt they were misrepresented in every way!!!
2,Not what I expected,"Like alot of others, I had a Wahl before and wanted to 'upgrade' to something, I hoped, would be more powerful, durable, and, especially, quieter. But I found this to be actually worse. I think it's alot louder--especially with the guards on--to the point that it's annoying to use...it is NOT ""Whisper Quiet"" at all; it's not really any more powerful, that I can tell anyway; and if you're looking to have the option of the 0 close trim with no guard this will not do it--at least the Wahl did that.The only better thing I can tell so far is the guards clip on tighter and stay on, which I've always had trouble with the Wahl's.To me, this is not worth the more than double price, and I've been clipping for 20 years. This will probably be the first thing I'll take the trouble to return through Amazon."
3,Its ok.,"These clippers feel like the higher end of the amateur sets. They are definitely the best I've ever bought, but not as good as the barbershop."
5,For the do-it-yourselfer,"This thing is great, barber-quality. There is not much to say, take care of it and it will last you a long time."
2,Not worth,"I bought this product to update from Whal, which I have been using so far. It is true that the Oster clipper is fast and very powerful. However, it gets hot immediately and for some reason it shorts the electricity. I have returned my first product, thinking that it could be a rare manufacturing failure. Nevertheless, the second one also has got the same problem, after which I returned it to the seller. So, I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Used as a Dog hair Shaver,"I had a large dog with very thick matted hair who needed to be shaved. The price was right, and it is a very hard working machine. Most people will use this for humans, but if anyone is looking for a good dog grooming clipper. This is great. Doesnt get too hot, and is quiet enough to shave around my dogs head without irritation. For thick hair like i had to go through, just take your time and work your way down. once you get past the matted part the clippers move through like butter."
5,Quiet and powerful,"We bought this to replace an old Costco special. This clipper came with a few cutting guides, some lube, and a cleaning brush. The cord is nice and long. The clipper itself is very quiet and powerful. I have thick hair and it glides right through without a hiccup. One piece of advice though, the guides slide onto the clipper...it took us a few minutes to figure that out."
1,Worst clipper I've ever owned,"I've struggled with this clipper for about a year, and finally gave up and bought a cheap Wahl. This one will NOT cut wet hair, and it barely cuts dry hair. What should take 10 minutes usually takes 30-40 because I have to go over and over my head to catch all the hairs this clipper misses."
5,Paid for itself,"This set is great for home use. Haircuts are expensive, particularly for those of us not interested in getting styled. Picked these up and they've already paid for themselves several times over! So far the durability has been very good and I've saved myself a bunch of trips to the barber.I would rate the overall power as medium. Definitely better than a cheapo set. It has always worked fine on the humans, but we did try them on the dog once and the clippers got overwhelmed. (I'm sure the dog was happy to get out of it anyway.)"
1,no better cut than the real inexpensive clippers!,"I keep a very simple ""buzz style"" short hair cut, and bought this unit hoping for a better quality cut than the $20-$25 units - but I am very disappointed. It leaves just as many ""straggler hairs"" as the cheaper clippers (having to re-cut the same area MULTIPLE times, and then I still have to go back then with a scissors to get the many hairs it still missed). Also this clipper does not offer a near zero depth cut. (I must have missed that in the description - my bad I guess.) The shortest it can cut is about 1/16"". Some of the cheaper units can be adjusted to a near shaved result for any unwanted hair areas. Not this one. The motor is quieter, and unit is light and easy to work with, but the result is very disappointing. I guess the options are to spend hundreds and get a truly professional grade clippers, or save a few buck and keep getting the cheap clippers. But I won't be buying or recommending this one to anyone."
4,Very good clippers,"I ordered these clippers because I thought they would provide a tighter cut without any attachment. But they basically cut the same length as any other set of Wahl clippers that you can get a lot places. However, these appear to be superior in several ways. They are quieter, cut really well and never get clogged, and (despite what others have claimed) they do not get hot. It comes with a sufficient number of attachments but the tiny brush leaves a bit to be desired. And they don't come with any sort of carrying case which is a drawback."
4,Oster Professional 76023,"I thought these hair clippers were a good value, to have been fairly inexpensive, and serve our purpose well. I don't think they would hold up for heavy duty use, without having to clean them frequently, but we are happy with them."
5,Well Worth the Money,Go ahead and spend a few extra dollars for this set of clippers versus the models sold at wal-mart and such. The motor is far superior to the vibrating magnet style of clippers. It will cut very thick hair with ease and very quiet as well. Would definiteley recommend to anyone who cuts their own or childrens hair. Would even go as far as to say it would hold up commercially.
3,"GOOD CLIPPER, SO-SO COMB ATTACHMENTS","This is a fine clipper set, but I'm knocking it down a bit because the shortest comb is not adequate. The teeth are spaced too widely, making it necessary to run it over the same spot several times to get an even buzz cut. We've given up on this comb; we adjust the bare blade to it's longest setting and cut the hair a little closer."
4,As a Barber I approve,"I have been barbering for a little over six years now and I have gone through several pairs of adjustable clippers. I've never found a pair that compares to changeable blade clippers like Oster 76's so I stopped lookings for that. I don't use adjustables for close cuts or fades, I generally only use them for normal clipper-over-comb style cuts and rarely open them all the way up. The Oster Fast feed is probably one of the best adjustable clippers I've ever used. They are quiet, light weight and keep relatively cool. As I said I don't use them for high or bald fades and wouldn't really recommend them for that style of cut (I would instead recommend the Andi's speed masters or Whal Sterlings). But for regular business or gentlemen's haircuts along with do-it-yourself haircuts at home, I would highly recommend these clippers. For the quality and price you can't do much better."
4,Oster Fast Feed Clippers,"I bought these clippers from Discount Jungle through Amazon. They arrived in a ""used"" condition (finger prints, hair on it). I contacted Discount Jungle and they accepted the return and quickly sent me a new clipper. They work great! They are much quieter than the previous ConAir clippers I had. They give even cuts and didn't nick or pull the hair of either of my sons during the hair cut. I would definitely buy these again!After I gave Discount Jungle a review of 3 stars (for sending the original dirty clippers), they called me and asked me to remove my review. In exchange they gave me a 90 day warranty vs the 30 day. I figured I could go back and re-write the review. However, it appears Amazon doesn't give you the option of rewriting? I guess Discount Jungle didn't like the 3 star review and wanted it off their record."
4,Better than real cheap cutters,"I have real thick hair. Cheap $25-30 models will not cut it. These will cut it, but I have to take my time or they will jam up."
4,Good Clipper,I bought to upgrade from the cheapos I had bought before at Target. I notice the difference in how even it cuts compared to the ones I had before.
5,Great clippers,"It has a powerful but quiet motor that can cut through hair at a fast speed and the adjustable clippers make it a breeze to quickly add or subtract millimeters of length quickly while cutting. Excellent product for the price, no complaints at all."
4,Works well,"I actually purchased these clippers to trim my beard. I have very thick beard hair which is difficult to cut and my cheap trimmers just weren't doing the job well.Oster Clippers:Cut quickly and cleanlySingle pass cuttingNo stray/missed hairsCheap Clippers:Cut slowlyRequired multiple passes on the same areaOften missed hairs requiring me to keep going back over the same areas for a clean cutNot sure what else to say other than they worked well, very smooth and easy, and cut everything in the first pass. It feels very solid and well built (no rattling or anything like seen in some of the other clippers). I would have no problems recommending these clippers to someone based on my experience with them. The only additional item I would like from these clippers would be a slightly closer cut. It leaves the stubble just a tad longer than I would like, but it is a totally normal length for most clippers, so not really a negative, just something to wish for."
3,"Works well, but it's worth paying extra for the Oster 76 classic","This blade works as intended, cuts well and is definitely a notch above the $20 blades you buy at WalMart. I did run into problems when I wanted to start using a shorter height blade (0000 and 00000). The minimum length with the Fast Feed is 000 and it does not accept replacement blades.So.... I decided to upgrade to theOster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipperand I would recommend this to anyone who shaves their head frequently. It uses a completely different and much more powerful motor than all the other clippers out there. The blades on the Oster 76 are detachable so you need to buy the 0000 and 00000 blades separately for about $20 each. It is a lot more expensive, but worth it, in my opinion."
2,Get hot very fast and broken now,"It was a good buy when I first used this Oster clipper for it quiet and sharp blade. But it got hot very fast, the blade got burning too hot for touching the skin, the adjustable blade had sometime didn't move up or down I had to use 2 thumps to push it. The worst is after 1 and a 1/2 year of using once every two month it's stop working now so I try to unscrew the blade to see if I can fix or clean the blade, but when putting it back the plastic body of the screw hole of the adjustable handle broken. Now I'm looking for the other clipper but not Oster anymore."
5,"Good Clippers for cutting, not for taping","I recieved these as a gift and I love them. The only con is that you WILL need another pair of blades for precise taping or trimming. Other than that, these babies cut through my hair like butter. I love them, but i'm glad i kept my old ones for fading and taping."
5,"Right after opening it, you'll know it's quality.","I'm very satisfied with this trimmer. It has a certain heft to it unlike many trimmers which feel like cheap plastic. It powered through my hair, which was about half an inch before cutting it. A lot of people complain about the lack of different guides, however, I have no need for anything besides a 1/4 inch guide.I've only used it once so I can't speak for its longevity, but it feels like a quality product and I expect that it will last a long time."
3,It's a hair clipper,"I was under the impression it would be built like a tank---while good, the on/off slide seems a little chinsy. It also only operates at 120V /60Hz, so if you are thinking of using it abroad, you will need an extra (heavy) inverter. The color is a darker red than the photo, and feels a little small in the hand (I have big hands). Nonetheless, it looks like it will do the job."
1,Very disappointing,I had high hopes for these clippers. Sadly disappointed. I shave my own head a few times a week. These clippers simply don't cut short enough.
4,Oster Fast Feed Clipper works as advertised.,"It is a little noisier and has a little more vibration than I expected, but overall I'm sure it is as advertised."
4,Clean Cut,"I cut hair for friends and family members, and my old wal-mart clippers were not doing the job. They would grab hair and pull occasionally, and they would leave the hair looking fuzzy.So I gave in and bought professional clipper. These are great! They are a little loud, but they make all the cuts look clean and professional. Well worth the purchase."
1,loses battery charge quickly and does not recharge well,"Had this unit for almost a year. Battery kept got noticeably weaker with every charge, now completely dead and cannot be revived. A waste of money. Good reviewers have not had unit long enough to experience battery failure. Beware!"
1,very unpleasent and nervuis,"im very upset with this item,while im trimming the whole hair clipper is shaking i would like to give that back i hope they will taked back its realy horably please make sure not to buy this model Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Bladei hope it will help for the future customer's"
2,Razor,My husband is ALS and I used this razor to shave him yesterday. It was very difficult and it did not give a close shave. Not happy with product.He had used it several times himself so didn't feel I could return it.
2,Don't give into the hype like I did,"This is the unrated version im talking about. Gorehounds don't get your hopes up because I have seen gory and this movie is NOT that gory or shocking. The plot is basically a German photographer rapes and kills a bunch of strippers and hookers while yelling nazi things at his victims in German. This guy basically yells in German throughout the entire movie even when he's not busy killing some hapless ho. A very forgettable movie in my opinion. So I am telling everyone thinking of buying this right now to stick with the classics such as ""Tenebre"" and the ""Sleepaway Camp"" franchise. If you waste $25 on this you will be in for a huge let down when it arrives."
1,wish there were 0 stars,"This movie is horrible but worse is the attempts by desperate online salesmen to make the less bright of us grab this awful DVD up... Gore hounds take notice, the blood looks fake, anyone who thought this was snuff must be color blind, not worth the cost, if you have a cool indie rental place (Louisville KY is so lucky) check it out if you got plenty of friends and beer, otherwise don't bother... Japanese Evil Dead Trap was wayyyy better"
5,Half Disturbing And Half Genius,"For one this movie is as everyone says it is. Your first thoughts after watching the movie is, its over? but then afterwards you think about the absolty grostique thoughts and actions this movie took. I wont give out any seens in the movie but people will be expecting crazy blood splatter and other horribal things. Yes you will get it and No you wont get it. you will because there are some pretty horrific parts in the movie now that I review it in my head..but theres also not as much gore as people said there was. This movie really is the basis of all horror films that go into the mind of a serial killer. if any director wants to make a movie like that then they should def. check this movie out becasue its a perfect example of what one does (or possibly does) on his free time or not free time. go and get this movie you wont be disappointed."
3,Liscensing/pay to play policy recinded,"White Wolf has responded to customer criticism and shelved the proposed liscensing policy mentioned in a previous review, so don't make your decision based on that information..."
4,FRESH & ENTERTANING,New twist on boy meets world.1) Boy is struggling prodigy w/ photographic memory living with & taking care of ailing grandmother.
4,A lot of fun,Took a chance on this series and I was pleasantly surprised. In fact watched the whole first season in 2 days.
5,A real world moment...,"I enjoy this series very much.I have to say that aside from the interactions of Harvey, Mike and Donna, the scene where Mike checks out Amanda Crew's (truly nice) ass as she is helping him out was a very real moment that made me laugh the most this season."
5,awesome law drama!,This is a great law drama with heart and believeable characters. It shows the hard work and high standards that lawyers must struggle with in order to succeed.
5,Awesome show!,"Great show, hot actors, what else can you ask for?? From the first episode I was hooked! I recommend everyone who likes lawyer shows to watch it!"
5,Excelent!!!!,"Best law Tv Show I have ever seen, Its a drama with a sprink of comedy I watch the show on hulu, but if you like to collect medias, you wont regret it."
5,Awesome!!!,Love this show! Bought the DVD the day it came out! Can't wait for the return of Harvey and Mike:)
4,"Good, but its when is he going to get caught","Love the characters, like the concept, but I keep thinking a firm full of Harvard grads, how come no one knows and if he's trying cases on his own they are in big trouble. I like it, but let get him a degree so that loose strand can end. I know its the set up, but the entire show shouldn't hang on such a flimsy thread the characters are good enough."
2,Suits turned unsuitable,"First episode showed promise.It was entertaining and witty, with potential relationship development between the two main characters. The second episode turned very mean-spirited, and lost the charm the first suggested. We've quit watching."
2,Suits:Season One,Got through the first DVD perfectly...it was great. Second DVD had a flaw in it and hung up or stalled mid episode and it was hard to continue the episode. Not really very happy with that outcome.
5,Where have you been Suits?!,"We are TV Series aficionados and very picky what we watch. Looking through IMBD I came across this one looking for a new series and am I glad I did. This is now our new favorite show, along with Breaking Bad, Dexter, Homeland, House of Lies and Revenge. Purchasing on Amazon Instant could not have been easier and I was very impressed with the HD quality (first time use of the service (have Netflix and may get rid of it)."
4,Those Clever Harvard? Lawyers,"This show is so much fun. Just watching the antics of this legal crew is a laugh a minute with a little seriousness thrown in now and then just to keep us grounded. Wouldn't miss it for anything,"
5,What a find!,One of my favorite TV series. Can't wait for the next season. I plan to watch it in real time!
5,Bad Ass,This show kicks ass! Surprise after surprise in this show. All the characters will make you go on a roller coaster of love and hate for them.
2,"Excellent show, useless DVD","I absolutely love Suits. It's funny, clever, heartfelt, and its characters are vividly written and portrayed. The two leads have amazing chemistry, the women on the show are stronger characters than you often see on TV, and Rick Hoffman does not get the credit he deserves for his work as Louis, believe me.But this DVD is useless. I'm unsure if it's a defect or some DRM lockdown, but the DVD refuses to play on a computer. There's no autorun program to unlock it either. So I bought this for nothing and will be returning it until a more functional format is available.Which is a shame, because I hear the commentary tracks are genuinely fascinating."
3,Need More Realism In Story Line,"I get tired of these story lines that forever have nothing but corporate bad guys. How about some stories built around inter corporate legal problems. The basic idea of this series is good, but how in the world can they make any money if all they do is sit around waiting to help some poor slob who's been victimized by who knows who. Also, I would get rid of the manager. She doesn't seem to realize her job is to keep the firm profitable - not assigning her top lawyers to charity cases. In fact I don't see her doing much of anything, but try an look important.However I do feel the series has great potential If you can bring little Law & Order realism to the story line."
1,did not purchase,this is another item that i did not purchase. Would like to know why this is coming up for me to rate?
5,So Witty!,"This show is awesome! I love the quick wit and humor. Every episode gets better and better as the characters develop. I was surprised that I could enjoy a show around law, but the writers do a fantastic job of weaving snippets of their work into the story line without fixating on the dry, boring subject that it is. Can't wait to start Season 2!"
5,Hooked,My husband and I were hooked after the first episode. It has a good story line and is also light hearted and fun
4,Another USA hit,At first wasn't so impressed but after a few episodes it started getting better. I gave 4 stars because some characters are just cold or bad at acting.
5,Good stuff,Good stuffI watched the whole season in two days. Very funny and a great take on how the legal system works outside of the courtroom.
5,Great Series,The script is phenomenal and the acting is even better! It's sarcastic tone is intelligent and very humorous. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves quality TV!
4,Terrific!,"This show is a great, grand, wonderful way to entertain the dream of becoming a hot shot attorney for a huge corporate law firm!"
4,I'd watch it again...,"How can one go wrong with old school Christopher Walken? Great movie, great picture quality. I will probably watch this again."
3,Just Adds Muzzle Weight,"This muzzle brake is very solid, very heavy and it looks cool. However it's just not a functional muzzle brake in my opinion. I have fired my GP WASR-10/63 with and without, it and I just can't tell the difference. I have also bump fired a full magazine (near full auto rate) and noticed little reduction in muzzle climb."
1,buyer beware!,"with this item i had a bullet strike the baffle within it, and it was a VERY unsafe situation, i would not buy another again!"

5,Work of a lifetime--The American Appaloosa Anthology,"Palmer Wagner has produced an extraordinarily beautiful and useful book. Written by someone who appreciates the beauty of the breed, Mr. Wagner provides readers with pedigrees and pictures that are based on years of personal involvement with breeders and their horses. The pictures alone are invaluable for those anxious to see the genetic background of modern day appaloosas. The book can be ordered directly from Mr. Wagner by calling 509-238-4533. I even got him to write a brief note for my volume."
1,Not used,"Purchased this book for a legal class. I marked up the first two pages and gave up. My professor decided to take the book off the reading list because she agreed it is not well written. She admires the author but not the way it is written. So of course now I have a book that I only marked on two pages, but can not return. What a waste of money."
3,Hard to Find at Local Stores,Could not find a simple electric clock in local stores. This is not an expensive clock but it does everything my husband wants. We will see if it lasts.
4,AC Powered Alarm Clock,"This clock is more than expected. The back lighting isn't a neon lamp, rather a couple LED's - which is good because the LED's will outlast a neon lamp. The alarm is loud enough to wake me up at 4 am. Unlike the old traditional AC alarm clocks with that awful buzzing alarm. I like how the alarm ramps up the longer it runs. The manual says the alarm is muted for 4 minutes on snooze but I have notice it goes 5 minutes on my clock. The ticking motion of the second hand is very quiet on my clock. And it has been keeping very good time.So far I think it is a good product. One thing I have noticed with this updated Quartz version is that it doesn't feel as warm as the traditional AC alarm clocks would get."
5,No plug just gasket,"If you have an annoying drip from your oil pan plug, just replace it with one of these copper gasket. This should solve the problem. It only comes with 3 gaskets, no plug."
2,Quality inconsistent,"My last purchase of 4 cases of this food had a sour off- smell. Called natural balance customer service, they said they hadn't received complaints about that batch, they'd pass info along to tech dept, they'd send me a coupon for 1 case.... But, it's a natural product, and variation ""was to be expected"". They suggested I return it to the retailer. Paying for shipping 3 times (receiving, sending back, receiving again) for a heavy product like this makes it very expensive.I've fed this variety to my 3 cats for a year (alternate with Natural Balance Ultra), and they have always loved it. They will only eat this batch if they are very very hungry. I can barely stand to open the cans. All other batches had a clean fresh smell.I'm disapointed with the customer service response to a quality issue from a heavy user of their premium priced product. (I have 3 cats). I won't buy from Natural Balance again. I'll use the coupon locally, and make sure I'm mixing production runs."
3,"Fun, well written","I'm a fan of Amanda Hesser's work in general. Although well written, something about this book didn't quite work for me. It's charming to start, but lacks the kind of insight that I know she's capable of as a true food sensualist. I agree with the other reviewer who felt it became repetitive. Having said that, it's an easy read, and there are numerous recipes. Maybe I expected more because I really adore her earlier book, The Cook & the Gardener, which is truly wonderful."
2,Elitist and seductive,"I expected to be charmed by this book, but I was left feeling like I'd just eaten too much of an oversweet dessert. The recipes varied from interesting to weird, and I would have liked to read a more psychologically nuanced story of the courtship in question. Instead the book was overstuffed with descriptions of one too many ""fabulous"" meals eaten in ""fabulous"" restaurants (all referred to as if everone should know of them) with Amanda's ""fabulous"" friends and Amanda's ""fabulous"" boyfriend (now husband). Reading this book one would think that there is no one who is not rich, white, ""terribly smart,"" and attractive in all of New York (let alone the world)!"
4,check the facts first,"Plenty of reviewers have commented on this book (and with such passion!). I am commenting of some of the misstatements in these reviews. Ms. Hesser does not claim Cooks Illustrated contains no pictures; what she actually wrote is that there are no photographs, which is true. The name of the New York Times writer mentioned by another person should be spelled R.W. Apple. Amanda Hesser does not write for Vogue; presumably this person was confusing her with Jeffrey Steingarten. And two reviewers wondered about how ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"" relates to ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar."" I assume they were trying to be funny."
3,Don't They Think About Anything but Food?!,"""Precious"" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Hesser's columns in the New York Times, now combined into an ode to love via food for her dear heart. Spare me."
2,Very tedious,"This book starts out promising--a love story of mismatched opposites. After the first 2 chapters, however, it turns into the diary of a snobby New York elitist. The amount of detail she would like the readers to care about concerning the most mundane experiences in her life is intolerable. She simultaneously derides American cuisine while saying that her family's ""lobster shaped meatloaf"" is the best. Her future in-laws seem to be the best cooks on the planet, which seems like pure pandering. Her absolute fascination with ""Europe"" (by which she means France and Italy) and her frustrations with taking her maladroit family members there is a tired cliche. The fact that she is so embarrassed at their behavior shows her to be spoiled. The recipes are mostly, if not all, culled from other sources. Thankfully, it is a light read, and the impressions it gives will not linger upon you."
3,Started well but disappointed,"I had high hopes when I picked up this book - catchy title, recipes intertwined in the story line - these things seemed to bode well. I like to eat and was looking forward to reading about food and maybe picking up a few recipes. Unfortunately, I am not a gourmet and I live in ""fly-over"" land. The restaurant name-dropping means nothing to me and I do not walk to the grocery store to buy Meyer lemons and sea salt. The more I read of this book, the less I cared. Out of the whole book, there was only one recipe I wanted to try and that was for the meatloaf, but even then I don't seriously think that I will try to shape it into a lobster... I am positive that there are people out there who will enjoy this book, but unfortunately, I am not one of them. Thank goodness I can return it to the library."
5,"Great book - and the recipes are good, too!","Having cooked often from THE COOK AND THE GARDNER and enjoyed Ms. Hesser's NYT column, I was very happy to see this book. Most of the recipes sound delicious (especially the vanilla loaves and the Airplane Salad) but what I loved most is Ms. Hesser's willingness to show that she is not perfect. We see her temper tantrums when people invade her small space in the kitchen (I'm sure we can all identify) or her frustration at learning to live in shared quarters with Tad, and learning to adapt some of her habits to his. I particularly disagree with the above comment about Ms. Hesser's ""gaffe"" re: the price of a meal at Jean-Georges. Why not see it as a ""foodie"" saying what she would say to any friend or tourist who was curious about the place? A so-called ""gaffe"" like that could happen to anyone. Overall, this is a wonderful, charming, witty collection with some great recipes. I look forward to more from this writer!"
4,Cute and a good present for foodies,"I really enjoyed this book's mix of recipes and anecdotes. Though it is slightly poseur at times, Cooking for Mr. Latte does a nice job of capturing Hesser's world of cooking,eating and dating in New York. Chapters on cooking as a couple and post 9/11 dinner party were served up particularly well.Overall, this is a bit like MFK Fisher for the 21st century, though perhaps a big more lightweight than Fisher's finest work. And one complaint....Hesser uses the word ""tangle"" about a million times. I know she's a better writer than that, and it drove me slightly crazy."
1,A horrible book by a horrible person,"I stopped reading this after a few chapters. I didn't even care what happened with Mr. Latte. The pair of them are too annoyingly perfect for me. Even her faults are too perfect, as if she needed to create an interesting personality by admitting that, yes, she, too, can make mistakes. Little ones. Fortunately, they don't get in the way of her beautiful life in ""New York's most fashionable restaurants with discerning foodie friends."" Gag.This was a gift from someone who thought I'd enjoy a book about life as a food writer, since I love to cook and daydream about becoming a food writer myself. I returned it for a real cookbook. I can only hope there's more to the food world than what Amanda Hesser sees."
1,"self-indulgent, vain-al-retentive","...Hmmm. Did Amanda write the last couple of reviews herself from ""Portland OR"", or did she have her sister do it for her? Weird that TWO such defensive, glowing reviews appear side by side from the same part of the country...oh well. This book is a self-absorbed souffle that falls flat. Perhaps it's supposed to be the point of this sort of writing, but when you do these little essays, you do run the risk of laying yourself open to any and all crits by *paying* customers...Ms. Hesser's writing was priced much more reasonably in the NY Times, which-well, I guess she's their EX-food writer, now. Pass."
1,The Most Trivial Piffle Ever Published by the New York Times,"Most of this book appeared as a series of food columns in the once august Sunday Magazine of the New York Times. After the 30 or 40 years of dedicated columns by the sainted Craig Clairborn and Pierre Franey, both of whom understood food, cooking, recipes, and how to write about them, these columns (and their recipes) by Ms. Hesser were incredibly callow, jejune, pretentious, and, in a word, worthless. Her relationship with the so-called Mr. Latte, which apparently was the pretext for presenting us with recipes for monuments to haute cuisine such as ""hardboiled eggs with mayonnaise"" or ""chicken breasts baked in (Hellmans) mayonnaise"", was even more tedious than her trivial chitchat about food. If you're about 17 years old and have never made (or contemplated) anything more complex than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, avoid it like spoiled mayonnaise!"
2,"good recipes, not much else.","I wanted to like this book. I did. The problem, however, is that Ms. Hesser, has nothing to say. The best food writers write about food as a way to access a deeper understanding about the nature of humanity. Witness Reichl's trilogy, in which you get an understanding of mental illness, the creation of oneself, the discovering of parents, and love, and a life's passion. Hesser's writings provide me with a superficial link to her foodie world, nothing else. Maybe she needs to suffer a bit before her next book, so that she can find some depth.However, the recipes are excellent."
3,Entertaining and Delicious,"I read this book while on holiday in Liguria. Though no Great Book, I found ""Cooking"" to be entertaining, but more importantly inspiring. Since I was surrounded by fantastic local ingredients, and many mentioned in the book were readily available, I tried several of the recipes. Much to my delight and my husband's satisfaction, Ms. Hesser has compiled a lovely culinary collection - several of which will become some of our ""standards""."
4,don't forget the salt,"""Cooking For Mr. Latte"" is an absorbing read for foodies and would-be cooks as well as the debutante and the young at heart. The Vogue food writer author effectively captures the perplexing mixture of anxiety and sense of adventure the happy yuppy bride-to-be experiences with just the right touch of satire. The restaurant reviews and gourmet cooking tips are excellent. If there's too much realism for you to enjoy her awkward courtship with the arrogant and fussy Tad Friend (what a name!!), hold out until they get their Brooklyn apartment together, where he finally warms up. (SEQUEL! SEQUEL!) While Ms. Hesser's almost anorectic fascination for food and quest for perfection might seem at times exaggerated, there is an admirable selflessness to her character; in sacrificing herself completely to the world of food and doing cooking to the extreme, she hopes us modern-day kitchen phobics will be inspired to do it at least a little."
2,Disappointed,"""Cooking for Mr. Latte"" deals with the author's quest to look for great food, and at the same time, provides brief information on her relationship with her boyfriend. In each of the chapter, the author would provide recipes either from restaurants or from friends and relatives. I was quite disappointed with the book as besides the recipes, the author's writing seems disjointed. In addition, if the reader is not from New York City, then he/she wouldn't know what restaurant that the author recommended. This plays a huge part in the book, which makes it hard to ignore. On top of that, I wish she had included more of her personal life or her relationship with her boyfriend. That being said, she did provides very interesting recipes. But note that, this is not definitely not considered a chick lit. There is way too little storyline for that."
1,"writer thinks she is wonderful, but I have to disagree",I wanted to like this book since I so enjoy books that center around food(such as diane mott davidson and tamara myers.) I could not finish reading this book due to boredom and frustration. I could not understand the main character's complaints about her boyfriend and her friends. Why anyone would want to date or marry her is beyond me.
3,"Great recipes, entertaining story","I think the best thing about this book is the recipes at the end of each chapter! Every single one that I have tried has become a household favorite and my friends demand copies of the recipe.The story is fairly entertaining with some nice anecdotes. I was especially interested to learn about the life of a food critic, which was completely new to me. However, if you're looking for great literature, this isn't it."
2,"Good Food, Annoying Author","This is a light read that didn't leave me with much aside from a couple of recipes I'd definitely like to try sometime. Amanda Hesser is clearly passionate about food, and that is very engaging. She is also clearly the most irritating person on the planet. Her snobbish rants about properly washed dishes and post-dinner lattes (egads, no!), and her overall pandering and name-dropping all get tiresome around page 40. Her writing, though at times quite charming, is also not anything that will bring one to his/her knees, to put it lightly. All in all, not bad train reading, but I kinda wish I'd saved my fifteen bucks and got the latest issue of Gourmet."
3,"Well, she admits to being a snob....","... which doesn't justify her snotty attitude, but it certainly makes me less likely to want to hunt her down and push her little barette-clad head into the roasted vegetables in the 'gourmet' salad bar in Brooklyn Height's (where I also dwell) Garden of Eden.I liked the book. I thought it was a clever and elegant idea. I just didn't like her. This summer I will be on the look-out for those stupid 70's barettes at the 'greenmarket' and will be sure to snatch up the last of the Meyer lemons before she can get her self-described 'delicate', Prada-wearing paws on them."
1,What a bore!!!,"Terrible....boring...tedious....writing was amateurish. If this is the best she can do I say....""please stop now"""
1,Viking-stove fire of the vanities,"The Friends vision of NY, scrubbed preppies fresh from the suburbs romping around the Upper West Side like it's one giant, singles-friendly Starbucks--that is what's being packaged here. The problem is that it's so...boring. This is Sex and the City without the sex, or the city. When Amanda Hesser writes about food, she's actually not bad. When she writes about herself, banalities pile on top of trivialities and the whole thing slides into self-parody, at which point it's so bad that it's almost, but not quite, good."
5,"Big and beatiful, great design, fast cutting.","I bought one of these off of Craigslist and I could not be happier. The saw will cut up to 38"". The table has three aluminum platforms that allow a gap between them. The extra extension for the table is great if you have a very wide part to cut. The water pump is put together with a single hose, that as it gets to the blade, it breaks out into two to deliver water to both sides of the blade. The motor is powerful and makes very fast cuts. The legs have plastic feet to not scrape the ground, and they fold for storage. It's a great saw if you have big cuts to make. If you don't, try one of their smaller saws, they work just as well."
2,Chicco Mamma Highchair - White Checks pattern,"The seat cushion fell apart in 3 months. And when food gets into the seat boy does it smell. It is not easy to clean, and there are straps handing loose."
5,The Private Lives of Pippa Lee -Blu-ray,"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee is the story of how Pippa Lee went from a runaway wild child in her youth to a serene, devoted wife and mother with a seemingly perfect life as an adult; everything seems to be going perfect for Pippa until her neighbors son, Chris who is played by a very handsome and clean shaved Keanu Reeves comes into her life and she finds out about her husband and best friend aren't perfect; The film looks great and the story line is ok but does tend to drag when going back to Pippa Lee's youth. The acting is good, especially from Robin Wright Penn and Keanu Reeves, but the film would have been much more interesting if it had spent more time focusing on the budding romance between the Keanu Reeves and Robin Wright Penn's characters and left the past in the past."
3,Liked Everything but the title,"Sly, imaginative take on a young party girl who marries an older man for money and what happens to her when she hits middle age and the older man is now REALLY old - the dialogue is sophisticated, the direction is lively and the cast is very appealing - Robin Wright Penn's best performance, and Keanu Reeves is very entertaining as a ne'er do well who is incapable of lying -"
2,forgettable film,"The Private Lives of Pippa Lee is a pretty forgettable film. My daughter bought this for me for Christmas thinking I might like it. I can't believe I actually watched it to the end. Throughout the movie they keep flipping back to her upbringing with an unstable mother to her present life where she's a woman married to a much older man and is loosing her mind. I found""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"" boring and not engaging. The lesbian raunchy scenes were so not needed in the movie.Overall the entire movie was definitely one to miss!"
4,Great price on good quality easel paper,"This paper is of medium heavy grade and is priced very well. The rolls are pretty long. I compared this roll to the ones offered at our local craft store and not only were these longer but they were less expensive per roll. The rolls fit the Melissa & Doug easel and are great for drawing or painting. Depending on how often you kids like to draw, the 3-pack should last quite a while."
4,"Goes great with the Melissa and Doug set, but......,","Completes your Melissa and Doug set! Papers is very good for crayons and lite painting, but I have a 2 yearold that paints over the same spot over and over again and the paper starts to tear and get soggy. Little bit of a bummer."
2,Paper quality,"I quite do not understand the excellent reviews this paper has been getting. The quality of the paper is very poor (e.g., paper is thin and not sturdy)."
3,OK.,Nice quality product but was not the right size for my kids easel. Be sure to measure your easel first because the are not all standard. Need to return it as it does not fit.
4,Fun!,Both of my children love the Easel supplies (we already had the easel). The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the paint does not come out of my kids clothing. It stains. :( The paint will run out and I can replace with washable and all the containers will still be great though.
3,This paper has pluses and minuses... Here they are,"Pluses:- I really did receive three rolls.- The paper is bright white.- For three rolls the price isn't bad.Minuses:- It is very thin. Much thinner than, for example, cheap copy paper. (Each 75' roll is less than 2 1/2"" in diameter.)- It wrinkles easily.- It seems to come apart more easily when wet (for example from painting with water colors or drooling) than other craft papers.- It's not as smooth, even right off the roll, as similar roll paper I've worked with.Bottom line: Depends on what you want it for. If you are getting paper for kids to doodle on this will be OK. If it's for water colors then it might pose some challenges. If you are using it as a photographic backdrop then it might be OK if handled carefully."
1,Cheap paper does not hold up to paint,"Let me first say my son loves to paint using the M&D easel. However, the M&D paper does not hold up and tears easily with paint. I would not recommend this paper. I ordered some 3rd party 50lb weight paper instead. The heavy weight paper never tore and can hold lots of paint."
4,easel paper,This easel paper is nearly impossible to find in stores. Thank you for making it available on line
5,For my son's 7th birthday!,"It's all he could talk about was an easel. So we bought this one. Very nice hardwood, good sound structure, sturdy and a nice size. Came with everything but the absolute necessities like paint, brushes and chalk. He loves it! Should last him a very long time."
4,Great Paper,"I got these in addition to the easel & they've worked out really well. It may have been the advertising and my misunderstanding of what I was to receive but I thought there would be more paper.The product overall is great, I just thought for the price there'd be more paper."
5,Great price and great gift!,my daughter got this for xmas and boy does she love being able to keep drawing! happy that we could get this for such a great price!
2,Not really extended,"This battery is eccentially the same battery you already own. It doesn't seem to give you any ""extended"" time. Don't buy this as an longer lasting battery, buy it as a second battery."
5,I connected! Video AAA+,"This program is wonderful! The production is top quality and Steve Murray presents the program in a way that's easy to learn and understand. I really didn't think a video could accomplish what this one claimed to do, but it does just that and more!I wanted to learn how to contact the other side myself without a medium or psychic. I must admit I had to watch the program about 10 times and take notes before I did my first session, but when I did, I connected with my deceased Father. It was a very satisfying experience. If you do not want to use a medium or psychic to contact the other side, you just want too connect first hand yourself (cut out the middle man), like me, buy this program, you will not be disappointed."
2,Dissappointed,"I was very dissappointed in this video. I thought very long and carefully before deciding to purchase it as I had read many wonderful reviews of Steve Murray's videos. But to be honest, it was like reading a paragraph of info on a blue screen with clouds and then Steve Murray comes on and asks you to touch your forehead while he says a few words. That is basically what it boils down to..."
3,How to contact Angels & Departed Loved Ones,I have viewed several of Steve Murray's DVDs but did not think this was one of the better ones.
1,kass99,I rate this book one star because norah hess seems to love to picture the male characters in her books as nothing but whoremongers.the male charachter in this book did not like nothing but ugly whores because of uncle's cheating wife who was beautiful.devlin the male character did nothing but sleep with prostitutes in this and treated d'lise like trash. The story line was interested expect the fact that devlin slept with a whore when he met d'lise and after she move in with him...he continued to sleep with indian whore...norah hess needs to stop making her male characters nothing but whoremongers..Trust I read 5 books of hers and all the male characters are nothing but whoremongers...the book ended with the delvin and d'lise getting back together after she moved out but the book was not that great
5,outstanding reading i love nora hess,"I loved reading this book, it was so enjoyable. The characters and the background setting are so empowering I just get swept away reading each chapter. I love it when Miss Hess always makes it a little hard for the man to get the woman or the opposite. Please keep writing these great stories."
2,The worst in the series,"This movie wasn't nearly as good as the others in the series. It was repetitive, slow moving and silly. I gave up on it after about 20 minutes."
2,Dundee in LA,It's was ok but not as good as the first two Dundee movies. I would recommend it you are a Crocodile Dundee movie fan.
2,Word of warning to buyers,"Not sure if it is the seller, ACE DIGITAL, that is responsible or the manufacturer, but this overlays (HSK-PROSLR) do not fit 3-inch screens. There is a 1/4"" gap all the way around the edges of my 3"" screen because the actual measurement of this item is 2.25 inches by 1.75 inches. I don't know how that translates to covering a 2.5-inch to 3.5-inch screen.The concept seems to work well. Doing some research, it appears that Hoodman does make a product that would fit 3"" screens (HSK-LARGE) which is available on Amazon, but they are advertising that as fitting even larger screens. Something is off here - so my recommendation is to buy one size larger than you think you need.And ACE DIGITAL is NOT recommended at all as an Amazon merchant. They have not returned any of my communications."
4,Get it now,"It works great. It was a little bit tricky to put on without creating bubbles. The viewer image gets sligthly blurry, and harder to see in bright light. But it sure saves the viewer from scratches. Get it now before you regret not having one. The pack comes with several. Maybe put one on your cell phone, too."
5,Kudos to MGM for correcting OAR problem,"MGM recalled the original issues of ""Hour of the Wolf"" and ""Shame"" because they were presented in a fake widescreen that cropped the top and bottom of the film. These are masterpieces that should not be missed, and they are now beautifully presented in their proper aspect ration of 1.33:1 with the entire image now intact."
3,Passable.,"This is not one of Bergman's best films. Fans of gothic psychology will love this but those of you used to classic Bergman symbolism - within the framework of a regular plot - will not be satisfied. The acting is good but the overall mood of the film is too unreal for it to have any existential merit. [The best scene is the one featuring the ""biting boy.""]The subtitles are in yellow and are a little distracting. I would recommend you disable your colour function. You will find the white subtitles just as easy to read."
1,Someone has to say it,"Well, I guess Hour of the Wolf must be a work of genius, since it's directed by Bergman and stars Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann. But honestly, this is probably the most depressing movie ever made. It's supposedly a gothic horror film, but there's no suspense, only horrific images. An artist and his wife spend a summer on an island where he is haunted by his memories. Told in flashback through the wife's recollections and the man's diary. The plot depends upon the wife's undying love and affection for the husband/artist, but Bergman never bothers to motivate the characters in any way, shape, or form. The man never shows his wife any love or affection, thus rendering her devotion incomprehensible. He is supposedly a great artist, but again no evidence is ever given. Bergman's artistic success are not a license to bore, imho. Hour of the Wolf is a depressing failure in any aspect ratio."
3,Not quite good,"It tells you how to make the operations, some physiology about skin cancer and a lot of pictures but there is no explanation on pictures that would clarify why exactly that picture classifies as certain type of skin cancer. You have to make your own theory.I wished author put two comparable pictures together and mahe differential diagnosis side by side."
4,Great game,"I got this for my boys for Christmas. They play soccer, so I thought they would enjoy a twist on the game. They are actually having more fun just kicking the balls around the house because they are light and safe to kick indoors. We haven't actually tried it outdoors yet but I think it will be a fun outdoor game also."
1,Author has been dead for 85 years,E. G. White died 85 years ago and thus did not write this book. It was compiled by her estate.
2,Fine for older kids,"I was looking for a portable cd player for my 3.5 y.o. daughter to listen to books on cd on a plane trip. This was the closest thing I could find, that seemed oriented toward the right age group. The headphones, however, were much too big for her, so they fell down and bugged her, or hung low so she couldn't hear very well. Additionally, the buttons were very small and unclearly marked, so even I had trouble figuring out which button did what. She used it a few times, but then one day it just didn't work, even after replacing the batteries. I have no idea what is wrong with it. This caused us to put her cd in the regular stereo and she seems to prefer this anyway. This wasn't an expensive cd player, but it wasn't really worth the money, at least for this age of child."
4,Solved my reloading 500 SW ammo problem,The 500 Smith and Wesson is a awesome handgun.But the recoil is so great that the bullets in the chambers that are not being fired dislodge and creep out of the cases. With a normal bullet seating tool you can not crimp them firmly enough to hold. If you try to set it so it crimps hard enough it will collapse the case and it cannot be loaded in the revolver. The redding tool work differently and squeezes the case and crimps at the same time so the case cannot collapse no matter how hard of a crimp you set the die for. Excellent product and even work on bullets with no cannelure.
2,Horrible Production/Mastering,"I realize that some of these songs are decades old and that recording quality isn't quite up to modern digital standards, but that's no excuse for sloppy production in putting together a compilation.Instead of a pleasant fade and short silence between tracks, most just cut off abruptly a fraction of a second before the end of the song. The real dealbreaker though is that the volume of several tracks warbles up and down throughout the song. I can even live with different volumes between tracks from different sources, but when the volume goes up and down within the same song it drives me nuts.Lots of tracks for the money (although I didn't get one track listed, still trying to figure out what's up with that) so I guess I shouldn't be too critical; you get what you pay for and I didn't pay much."
3,I only like some of his stuff,I don't listen to his cd very often as I don't seem to like much of his stuff. I thought I did but I was wrong.
2,Faron Young - All Time Greatest Hits,"Did not meet my expectations; overall I was disappointed with this Faron Young CD. I like his music, just not this recording."
4,Replacement,I am replacing all of my old 33rpm records. They bring back old memories which I cherish. We will be playing it often as we travel around the USA.
4,Faron Young CD,The CD will go into my permanent old time Country collection.Several great old hits by a fine C&W; star.Recommended for old time country fans.
5,Required Reading,"Oded Shenkar's book is a fascinating read with a powerful message: The Chinese Century is coming and there's not much we can do about it.China is developing at a remarkable pace. They add 4 to 6 million cell phone subscribers every month - over a year they would be adding as many as the entire cell phone market of United Kingdom! The Chinese are building municipal infrastructure every month that is the equivalent of a Houston, Texas. China attracts the biggest foreign direct investment (FDI) in the world and is buying 7% of the world's oil! In facts most of the Fortune 500 CEOs seemed more optimistic about the Chinese economy than the American economy.This book is a conversation-starter. It's a conversation about the future of the global economy and your role there. Everybody who concerned about America's place in the 21st century must read this book, because 21st century might well be known as the Chinese Century..."
5,Must read book for 21st century!,"This long-awaited insider's view of doing business in China informs you of the pitfalls and tells you what you need to know to succeed in the twenty-first century's great new business frontier. Oded Shenkar provides comprehensive but well-written review of the current political and economic system of China. Particularly interesting is a portrayal of the recent trends in US-China relationship. As the title of the book suggests, China will shape the world in the next century. The book is written primarily from an academic perspective, focusing on China's economic and market potentials and the impact of political developments on the business environment. It is must read for every business person."
4,Assessing China from a balanced view,A very timely and informative book that pictures Chinese economy and its implact on the rest of the world from a very balanced lens.
3,Scratch the Surface,"Shenkar's ""Chinese Century"" is a basic description of China's economy and how it influences global economic balance - especially the US and Asia. The problem is it is too basic. Another reviewer's suggestion that it is like reading a synthesis of business journal articles is accurate. Shenkar lacks the depth that this issue deserves. Really, how much depth can you get on this complex issue in 176 pages? Too many typos and grammatical errors and the writing is dry. That said, it seems to be one of the only background books on the market and it is a decent, although very basic, introduction."
2,"Disappointing, run-of-the-mill","I bought this book expecting new insights or at least new organization. I found neither. Oded Shenkar's book sounds like a musty copy of the Economist. He appears to have no in-depth knowledge of China -- or India. What are his credentials to write about these issues? Is he an expert on the economy? Or perhaps on culture? Has he ever worked or lived in these countries?For a more reasoned analysis with this ""objective"" analytical approach, I would recommend several IMF/ADB papers (all available for free on the web.) I am surprised at all the glowing reviews -- it appears that no one has read the news papers or business media for a while (Shenkar's muse it seems)."
5,Far-reaching insights,This book portraits a realistic future of the Chinese economy and its profond impacts on the globalization. The author goes beyond the presence and offers far-reaching insights to where the Chinese economy will evolve and how the Chinese economy integrates into the web of the global economy. It is a must reading for those who want to be the tomorrows' business leaders and policy makers.
5,Entertaining and insightful but doesn't have ALL the answers,"I think the author brings up some very interesting observations about current business environment in China, although I'm not sure what the end result is to the reader. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book immensely and will recommend it highly. Develops very helpful frameworks for doing business in China but the books fail to come with the simple action plan that reader like me could use. I've noticed several reviewers seem to be wondering what, in essence, this book means for them, and to this I will say that it's great, thought provoking insights about future of the world economy and the Chinese role in it.Highly recommended."
4,Better Than Hee Haw,"People who only know Buck as the picking and grinning Roy Clark sidekick ought to know that he made some fine music--heck, the Beatles even liked him. This collection, albeit brief, is a good overview of Buck's work."
5,Teach Yourself Visually Crocheting,"Excellent book! I am new to crochet and the pictures were very helpful as well as the ""in plain english"" instructions. I was able to try and successfully complete many new patterns/stitches. I would definitely recommend it to any new stitcher."
5,crochet,"I received the book very promptly, and was very pleased with the content and price. I would definitely reccommend the book for anyone wanting to learn to crochet."
4,Return Crocheter,"I wish I had this book back when I was learning to crochet. It has very complete easy to follow instructions, great pictures that show the different stiches plus some basic patterns to learn by. I like it."
2,Don't Bother,"I purchased this book with high hopes, knowing nothing about crochet. I was able to Follow the instructions through the first chain stitch...After that I was frustrated and confused. I went to you tube and it was so easy to follow. Should have gone there before buying this book. Maybe now that I understand the basics I can go back to the book to learn more stitches. Fingers crossed I will gain something from this purchase."
5,Amazing instructions,"I received this book yesterday. It is amazing how easy it is to learn how to crochet from this book. The packaging was great and it arrived before the date that was on the tracking info. All in all, I am extrememly happy with this purchase."
2,Lacking for beginners,"I was hoping this book would help me learn to crochet, I found it lacking in the visually aid department and found it hard to do quite a few of the stitches, it easier to use the video on the computer."
1,NOT for beginners,"I bought this book because I have no experience crocheting and I wanted to learn how. I am really disappointed with the book. It really glosses over some of the more difficult key points, such as the transition between finishing a row and starting another. It will give you one picture and a brief description to go with it. What is really needed at this point are a number of pictures, or at least some diagrams. I can't even complete the first series of stitches in this book. From now on I will go to the library and check books out before buying."
2,Almost Useless,"I learned two or three things from this book so far, and I have pretty much given up on it. I read the introduction to learn about hook sizes and the like, then moved on to actually learn some stitches. For a real beginner trying to teach myself, I found this book to be nearly useless. The instructions feel very incomplete to me. I have been watching youtube videos and have found them to be much clearer and more complete. Save your money and search for learning to crochet videos. I am currently making a granny square afghan with several different stitches and techniques in it, and it's all thanks to the internet, and no thanks to this book."
1,"""Upgrade"" to digital version not worth it!","I purchased this book and haven't yet seen the print version, but I can tell you that the supposed ""upgrade"" to a digital version is unreadable. The page images are fuzzy so that the text is illegible in some instances. For a book where it's really important to see the details, this is unacceptable. I've asked Amazon for a refund and I won't be ordering any more ""upgrades.""So this review isn't about the substance of the book (I'll know more about that when I get the paper copy). It's about the production of the digital version."
4,Easy to Follow,"I took a crocheting class and wanted to learn more so I purchased this book. It's easy to follow, beautiful illustrations and has lots of stitches. Would highly recommend it especially for anyone learning to crochet."
1,The pictures add confusion rather than clarify,"This book really let me down. It's more text than pictures, and the pictures are not close enough or step-by-step to really get an idea of what's going on. Lots of time you don't know what you're looking at and you have to look at the extensive text to get a clue.Waste of money. Go to youtube to get better, close up, in action instruction that you can keep rewinding until you've got it down."
4,Using as a crochet refresher course,"Purchased to hone crocheting skills and relearn forgotten stitches. Book arrived in 'like new' condition, although it took a while to arrive. Yet, it was still on time. The pictures showing the crochet steps are actual photographs which is helpful. Worthwhile purchase for those wishing to learn this skill."
2,Disappointment,The projects in this book are ugly. There are plenty of other books to learn the basics. This book quite literally teaches you how to make crap. 2 thumbs down.
5,Really Super Crochet Images,"This book contains some great crochet images all in some vivid colours, it is perfect for those wishing to take up crochet. It is ideal for those who are visual learners and need to see what they should be doing. This book makes it easy to check out what work should look like. Images are clear and close up.Only downside to this lovely crochet book is that it is rather expensive. Another good simple crochet book for beginners isSimple Crochet - 7 Easy to Crochet Simple Patterns"
5,Nice book,I love all of the teach yourself visually books. Although I have been crocheting for a number of years I like to purchase these books once in a while just to share with other people still learning and I like to have reference just in case I need it.
5,viaually crocheting,this book is just great for the beginner or the more advanced crocheter. I use it all the time and have ordered it for other people. I give this book A+++. It has everything in it that you ever need to know.
1,Not clear or visual enough for a beginner,"Unfortunately, the book leaves out key photos and explanations. Close-ups of parts of each stitch would have made things much clearer.For example, I was able to make a slip stitch, a chain stitch, and a foundation chain (I think), but at that point, the book instructs the reader to turn the piece. It doesn't explain or show a picture of what it means to turn the piece. Work from the back of the chain? Turn how you're holding it in your hand? This book didn't help me understand.Save yourself the money. There's plenty of better information--with clearer pictures--available for free on the Web."
3,It's okay,"I really wanted to love this book. I could not wait to purchase this book that's why I bought the Kindle edition. I tried to follow the directions in the book but they were a little confusing. What I was trying to do was to learn how to crochet but all it did was confuse me more. I found the book ""I can't believe I'm crocheting"" to be more helpful. Now I am a lefty and in that book it has the right-handed version and the left-handed version and it shows you the basic stitches which is what I needed. Now ""Teach yourself visual crochet"" is a good book, but I will be using it in the future once I master the stitches that I am learning in the "" I can't believe I'm crocheting"" updated edition book. The visual crochet book does go more in depth with others stitches and other things you can do in crocheting. So overall it's an okay book but to learn crocheting, I'm for ""I can't believe I'm crocheting"" updated edition book."
5,If you only could have one crochet book...,"This probably would be the one to get--it has the most comprehensive and easy to understand instructions of any guide I've seen. As a crochet teacher, I've watched students struggle with trying to reproduce what they see in the line drawings that are used in most instruction books. TYVC uses photographs which are well done and easy to follow and understand. Pretty much every aspect of crochet is discussed and cool patterns highlight the techniques your teaching yourself--I especially like the spiderwoman belt and the tunisian crochet tie."
2,Not as easy as you think,In Teach yourself visually crocheting. I feel they were showing people with some knowledge of crocheting anyway. If you are a novice like I am you need more angles shots of the stitches. Especially beginning and ending the rows.
4,cosmetics,"this is a nice conditioner for detangle your hair . it keep my hair soft , after shampooing,"
3,Expexted better,"It's an interesting book but nowadays, the good books have more photos than this one.Although it's a good book and worth the money."
5,Outstanding,"Nothingless than perfection from BFlay, as we like to call him! The cookbook is filled with awesome looking recipes - and nothing too difficult to handle. Very happy with my purchase."
3,It's Crabby,"Fine sized frozen soft crabs. All were very tasty.I am so use to getting Chincoteague Island, Vafresh soft crabs during the season that it takes alot for me to eat frozen ones. These were worth it."
2,Disappointing,"Although the photos are lovely, the book does not provide any helpful information on how to create a ""getaway"" for people who live in real houses and have less than six figures to spend. There are lots of other fantasy books on the market like this one. Too bad it doesn't explore ""new routes"" to producing a getaway for the average person."
1,Disappointing in every way,"The cover on screen looked so lush and inviting, but the actual book is smaller than I expected. The photos aren't big enough. Because the book is small and narrow, it isn't a good gift book, either. (If it were, I'd give my copy to someone else.) I also found that it isn't a good read. It tells little stories of each home and owner but leaves me completely on the sidelines. If I'm not interested in these people (and, in general, I'm not), then the book has nothing for me at all. I was expecting large and lush photos and some information that I could use in my own getaway home. The book isn't well organized, either, because it seems like a bunch of homes sort of ""glued together"" to make a book. I can't quite figure out what the point of it all is."
2,Here's a recommendation,"To the customer who found the book disappointing, I know what you mean. The book you want, instead, is called COTTAGE STYLE, and it's a practical and beautiful guide to decorating with that second-home LOOK in mind. It helped me turn my suburban two story into what looks like a back-roads cottage."
5,A book that is great fun!,This book allows one to dive into the lives of the rich and famous and see first hand the enviromment where those such as celebirites go to relax. This book is creative and one of a kind!!!
5,A Book that Inspires,"After looking through this book, i was inspired and enchanted by the diversity of the getaways presented by the author. To me, this book captures the true meaning of a getaway, and does a good job of showing the different aspects of what a getaway is...I was escpecially impressed and surprised with Michael Keaton's house in Montana,which is not what I would expect of a celebrity of his status."
1,Left me out in the cold,"A pretty book but not one that invites me in or offers me inspiration for my own decorating.It's a book you keep at arm's length because you know it has nothing to do with your own life. Interesting that the author shows very expensive homes of wealthy people yet has designed a collection of getaway furniture for a low-end furniture maker whose products would never appear in the homes shown in the book. As for this book, I think it's aimed more at snob appeal than helping readers. I'd rather see inventively designed and decorated homes created for real people of the middle and upper-middle classes."
1,I recommend a different book,"I wrote an earlier review of this book after I was a bit disappointed in it. In my search for books on getaways, I have found a new book called Second Home, which both my husband and I are enjoying. It mixes tours of interesting and beautiful homes with information on how we can do something to make our own second home dream come true."
2,Disappointing,"This book left me a little out in the cold. Maybe it was the unexpectedly small size of the book. Maybe it was the superficiality of simply being shown a scattering of getaways and reading about what other people did. What can I do? I searched for ""second homes"" books on amazon.com and found one called Second Home, which is bigger and more inspiring than the Getaways book but which also talks to me about my own dreams and needs. As a designer, I have used the quizzes in the book to guide my clients in deciding what they really want, too."
5,Love this book!,I bought this book for my twins when they were 2. They are now 10 and we were looking for a book to donate to my niece who is having a baby. I asked them about giving her this one and they said no way! I just ordered 4 online because four of my family members are having or have had there baby already this year. This is an excellent book to add to any childs library!!!
1,Piece of junk,"It was extremely difficult to put together. What's worse is that in less than one month, the wood is splintering and falling apart. Naturally, it would be complicated and extremely labor intensive for me to try to disassemble it and return it, though I still might. I have tried to make some repairs to it myself but I have decided the wood is just cheap. I am extremely angry and will never buy from this manufacturer or seller again! I feel ripped off and swindled."
4,2 Seat Glider Assembles Easily,"This glider was packed well and recieved with no missing parts. The assembly instructions were very difficult to follow and could be improved but the bench itself was fairly easy to assemble. The thickness (weight) of the wood seat and back, could be more substantial for heavier adults. The price was reasonable but will not know how well it holds up, since it was only just put together. The finish on the wood needs a sealer for weather protection and better appearance. I would rate this glider a 7 on a 1-10 scale."
1,I want my money back.,"I thought a relatively exciting and thought provoking subject for good reading would be the Jack the Ripper murders. How could one take such a fascinating subject and make it boring? Angus McLaren must really have tried to structure his sentences so there was no cohesive thought, no sense of continuity from one paragraph to the next. Although it does serve admirably well as a sedative. At one point, I had to go look at the copyright date to see if this was written in the 19th century colloquial."
3,HDV is only good for cost conscious shooters,"HDV is only a way to get near-HD recording for cheap. If cost is more important than image quality, then HDV is the way to go. This camera claims ""True 1080"" resolution. Unfortunately, that's a marketing term that is meaningless. No HDV camera can capture true HD 1080 resolution on tape which is defined as 1920x1080 pixels. The HDV format is limited to 1440x1080 and ultra-crummy 4:2:0 color sampling. Plus HDV's MPEG-2 codec is notoriously funky to edit with. You are missing about 25% of horizontal pixels with HDV compared to real HD.I would not recommend HDV if you plan to do any chroma keying, visual effects (compositing) or extensive post effects (like Magic Bullet). If you need to do these things, I would only recommend an HDV camcorder that has uncompressed HDMI output paired with an Intensity Pro card for capture."
5,Canon video camera,This camera was purchased for our newspaper. It does even more than we expected it to. A great product creating marvellous pictures and sound especially when we video a local symphony orchestra.
5,Great HD cam,"The Canon XH-A1 is a great entry level professional HD camera. It has amazing clarity and is very good in low light. The customization alone makes the camera worth its price.The quality of the HD footage is extremely nice. Be aware that the SD quality is not as good as a real SD camera, and SD 4:3 has blurring issues. But then this is an HD camera so it is refined for HD. Recommend taping and editing in HD and output SD if that is what is needed.Also, this camera needs a lot of light, even though it is 3-CCD it requires a bit more light than a 3CCD SD camera. Get a good light if shooting indoors.And since this camera has so many features it requires the user to sit down and learn it before venturing out to do real work.All in all it was a great investment and has increased the quality of my work."
5,XH A1 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!,Since the purchase of this excellent camera We have been able to capture some of the greatest hunting footage my team has ever experienced. Camera has performed flawlessly in 30 degree weather and up. Beginners can pick this camera and be filming in no time at all! Some of the highly detailed settings are complicated but the auto mode eliminates the guess work on them. Fitting it in my budget to purchase TWO more of these by september. Will never use anything but a canon. Got an eight year old XL1 that performs just like a new one! What are you waiting for? ORDER ONE NOW!!!!!
5,PlanetSide's Explosive!!,"This is the best MMOG that I have ever played! It's also good to be in the game from the beginning, because we get to see it as it develops into a better and better game!There are some lag issues, but the Producer gives really good updates on when things will be addressed and what the plans are to make this game even more awesome!If you haven't tried an online game... this is the one to start with! There is a training area and everything!Way to go Sony Online! I look forward to the improvements.Like I said... give this game a chance! It's well worth it!"
5,Tap the potential!,"People say it's lousy. People say it lags. But do they talk about the real time wheather, cool guns (triple barrel shotgun, people!) and excellent squad based combat? Nope. I have 56k and a 800 mhz processor and it works great on my PC! You can become litterally anything you want: a daring Assault troop, deadly sniper, or just a guy who shoots up things with a gun. Your choice. And the lag? Almost none on my AVERAGE system. Just beware of phone calls. They mess you up. But for you who don't have call problems, and have a fancy for carnage, action, and teamwork, this is a great game for you!"
2,SO Much Fun.........Then boring as hell,"I have owned this game for 2 months now and I thought when I got it, it was the most fun ever. Then after doing the same thing over and over and over the game goes downhill.Pros:-Lots of different things to specialize in.-If you mess up your character you can fix it-Vehicles are fun to use-Great PVPCons:-Lots of downtime waiting for things to happen ie. Waiting for the capture of a base... takes 14 min for each base capture.-You NEED 512 Ram and a decent processor-Vehicle controls are hard to use-Very Repetitive... Get Group..take base..take base...take base..take base..take base..take base or Get group..die..die..die..die..-Not a lot of awesome battles-Races are not evenly matched Vanu are extremely at a disadvantageIf you&#65533;re looking for quick fun then buy this game, but as a long term game.. This isn&#65533;t going to get far."
4,Unbearable Lag at times but very fun,"Let's start off by saying that this game is a ton of fun. The bad part, and it can get very bad...is that this game is VERY laggy. I have a high end system and I can't enjoy the luxary of cranking up the graphics. IMO this game is not playable as promised. It is not up to par. It will be once they address this lag issue. Until then..."
3,What to do next?,"I took part in the beta. I was captured by the massive battles and the fun that this game does offer. However, after about a month, I got tired of it. Its the same thing every time. Get to location capture base, move to next base, capture base, etc etc. Too much repetitiveness for my taste."
1,SUX SUX SUX,"It seriously is good for two weeks, then u get tired of the stupid deaths that are consistantly seperating you from your team"
2,"Frustrating game with poor gameplay, bad lag","The good point is that the concept is not bad but the actual game is. Bad controls, glitches in the program, bugs make this game frustrating to play. Very disapointed with this game."
1,where's the single player mode?,"I consider myself a true, dedicated fan of all sci-fi and fantasy games. Usually when a game comes out that has on-line/campaign mode, there is a single player mode for those of us non ""on line"" player, people who just like to play against the A.I. So to speak. So when I seen this game and the beauty of it I said, WOW! Looked for a sign that said single players.....NOPE! After I bought it I got a surprise of my life...Just on-line and for on line use only! I know some of the on line games such as never winter nights or half life are either single player or multi-player....boy I wish this was! I would've been happy if it would have been. Now it just gathers dust in a corner somewhere. So thank you Sony entertainment for nothing!"
3,Okay but takes time,If you have time this is the game for you. You have to get new battle levels which take forever to get and the FPS isnt that great either. ALSO YOU HAVE TO PAY MONEY A MONTH AND THAT STINKS
2,Bad programming and design ruins the game,The aircraft controls and gameplay in this game are absolutely horrible! They should take a good lesson from Halo on how to design aircraft controls.The player vs player combat is flawed as well. Here they need to learn a good lesson from Quake 3 in terms of gameplay.I bought this main game but WILL NOT buy the core combat expansion as I think this game is not worth it.
5,Fantastic Read,Meier is one of the greatest modernist architects of our time and this is a great reference of his work.
2,Misleading title!,"This is *not* the ""Absolute Best"" of Bing Crosby. No way! I have been following Bing's career since I was 6 years old and own nearly every song he ever sang and I have never heard of ""Dardenella,"" which is inexplicably included on this collection.There is simply no way to condense Bing Crosby's prodigious musical catalgue into 10 songs and many of these songs were never issued as singles, much less regarded as a hit. It's totally insulting to include a non-entity as ""Bye Bye Blues"" on a Crosby collection os supposed hits. Bing's great songs from his golden era of the 30's and early 40's comprise 10 great songs in *one* month.The songs selections here cater strictly to Bing of the 40's and 50's, when Bing's voice was not as compelling a musical instrument as it had been in the 30's. Avoid this sorry collection, if you're seriously interested in understanding and appreciating Bing Crosby, please consider buying the better 4-disc collection offered on Amazon."
5,Just as described,This item arrived just as described and works perfectly with the mixer that we bought it for. Thanks for a great deal!
3,Crashes constantly,"I had to call tech support to even get this game to install on my machine. It turns out that if you have a hard drive named ""Data"" the game will not run. Who would have thunk? So, I renamed my hard drive and the game works ok, but it crashes about every 15 minutes, so get ready to save your game alot. Otherwise, its pretty fun. Its like sim city for pirates. I can see how it would get pretty repetitive after youve played it a few times."
5,ARRR...don't be missin' the fun,"This game is a whale of a good time! If you like games such as Stronghold, Age of Empires, Age of Mythology, etc., you will enjoy this little treasure.History mixes with fiction to make a splashing good time for both landlubbers and pirate royality alike.Enjoy!"
5,Tropico 2 Pirate Cove,"Good Game To Play Anytime. Great Graphics, Fun game overallThis Game is not waste of your money. I have bought this game twice because i lost it.Try the other Tropico games theres good aswell."
3,Fresh Coat of Paint,The graphics are a little out of date compared to games like Sim City 4.All they really did is but a fresh coat of paint on Tropico.Hey it's fun but they fell short on something orginal.But they give you a very nice booklet explaining a few things more than other game companys due.
2,A typical simulation,"The game might seem fun at first but then after a while it gets old. All you have to do is build and wait. You can set ships on sail, however, but you don't have control of them and you don't even get to see them. So if your not a simulation fan skip this."
5,This is a 10 ! !,"This with no doubt is one of the best books I have ever read. I marvel at the mix of intrique, mystery, Law and all with a slight background of religion. The feelings brought on reading this novel were touching. Imagine all that had happened to the main character and try and imagine this happening to you burys your mind in the book. Do not miss reading this one."
5,Non-stop Action - Unpredictable - Realistic - NO FANTASY!,"I love this book! The gifted author draws you into every scene with his vivid descriptions and his frequent mention of actual landmarks in Chapel Hill, Nags Head and Charlotte, NC. You'll walk with Charlie Harrington on a Spiritual journey that leads to both victories and tragedies. You will rejoice with him and you'll weep with him. This is a book you don't want to miss!"
5,Thriller!,"Thrills, chills, and legal loop-de-loopholes: this novel has 'em all. Got an evening with nothing to do? Then spend it with a cerveza and Charlie Harrington in Chitwood's dazzling debut."
5,"Artistic, sensitive and poetic","I have used ""Letters From The Closet"" for my college human sexuality classes since it was published because it is beautifully and soulfully written by two intelligent authors who speak the truth about some of the real stuggles for understanding and relationship that many gays and lesbians have faced. It is an exquisitely artistic book, written with fine humor and drama, engaging to the very end leaving you wanting more. I enjoy it every time I read it gathering more subtle beauty each time, and I have heard hundreds of touching responses from affected students. I have been lucky enough to have Paulette Jacobson guest-lecture in a number of my classes over the years, and I could not recommend someone more highly for her engaging wit and her frank, moving presentation of her experiences in life. She is a truely gifted speaker and writer."
5,Excellent,This book is excellent for the beginners and advanced. As usual O'Reilly delivers top-notch writing material on Linux. I highly recommend it to anyone new to Linux and even the experienced.
2,Like man pages,"I was hoping this book would have more about the system specific issues of Linux like how to make a new kernel, administer modules, users, groups, basic networking, etc. things that you couldn't just look up in a man page. It's pretty much a condensed version of the command man pages and reference to some editors. You can get that stuff online when you are in a command shell. What I expected is a book that has helpful insights into Linux system and network administration that assumes you know the basics but just need some extra reminders on how to keep your Linux system running smoothly."
5,"Not a tutorial, but ONE HELL OF A REFERENCE!","It is not in any way a tutorial, but a supplement that is a MUST HAVE. It is like having all the ""man"" pages and more laid out for you. It covers most of the common command line commands with the proper syntaxes. For those serious about learning the OS from the ground up, make this book the second book you buy (tutorial/installation guide being first). I promise this book will stay in use next to your computer. The only fault this book has is that it could use a few more examples."
4,First One I Turn To,"I have a shelf of unopened Linux books. Even the ""Practical Guide"" with an introduction by Linus himself is hardly ever looked at. This is the one I use when I can't remember or don't know. The man pages in a highly readable format; it's worth the $$. Just wish they included a few more examples. It's all there--arguments are listed and described, but that cryptic and terse man page style can be unhelpful. More examples would make it easier to figure out."
5,One of the BEST,"This book, which I have just read last month covers every part that is needed to know by every Linux users. Not only it covers commands for users but also commands for System Administrator and so on. The language is simple, everyone can understand what it is trying to say. Well, I will comment more later."
2,Not as useful as you may expect.,I found the commands documented to be incomplete and their descriptions often too brief to be effective for reference. I find it easier and more informative to just dig-in and read the man pages.
2,man pages lite,"I was really dissapointed with this book. I own a few of the nutshell series (java, etc) and consider them very good., but this book was a waste of ink. There is nothing in this book that you couldn't get by just reading the man pages. What we needed were examples!"
3,Do you REALLY need this one?,"I have this book, but I have reaely referenced it. Being what it is, the man pages are just as helpful. Some people however, do not like reading from a computer screen, I can understnad that, a book is just more comfortable- this book is for them. My biggest gripe is that this book is not organized well. A book of this type should simply organize the commands alphabetically. However, it is a decent book and the information is quite useful. So because it is a useful book that I simply don't like by prefrence i gave it three stars."
2,Did the author ever _really_ run Linux?,"Geez. I really wanted this book to be great, in the tradition of the O'Reilly ""Nutshell"" series. The first clue that this would be a flawed attempt at a much-needed references comes from the author's credentials. Although equipped with magna cum laude honors form Harvard, Hickman's speciality is Middle Age lit. The lack of attention to detail in this publication shows that the author's heart wasn't in the 1990's and Linux. The section on the bash shell is laughable, showing syntax such as (< list) as available. It also shows ""print"" as a bash-ism. There are many more serious errors in just this section alone. The discussion of ""gcc"" is equally weak. There's a reference for options but _none_ of the -f flags! Also lacking is an mention of ""ed"". This idea for this book is excellent -- but it fails to meet the expections one takes for granted from ORA."
4,"Excellent reference, better than the man pages","This book was listed as an optional textbook for a Unix (Linux) class that I took, but I quickly realized that there was nothing optional about it. I had to have it. I use this book often since Linux's man pages can be somewhat cryptic to a new user like me. The author does an excellent job of explaining the commands and options in plain english.Obviously since this is a reference book (basically a Linux dictionary) you will not read it cover to cover. Instead you will find yourself constantly referring back to it, looking up new things you haven't seen before or old things that you can't quite remember. Having this book on your shelf is sort of like having a good Webster's dictionary, it's a must."
4,Great Friday night listening,"This cd was all, I hoped it would be, anybody who loves Southern Soul this is a great buy!"
5,Description,"This Was The First Gun I Ever Bought, Whenever You Shoot This Gun Prepare to Sting the Person You Aimed At, It Hurts So Bad Sometimes Its Not Even Funny, I Caught My Friend Trying to Escape By Jumping the Fence And I Aimed For The 2 Seconds I Had and Fired, they Had a Huge Welp And it Lasted About 2 weeks, This Is A Great Gun, But, Be Carful When You get It Cause When You Do You'll Own Them d:D"
4,For What It's Worth,"I purchased two of these Airsoft M16-A4 Rifles and the build quality is as to be expected for the price I paid. My only issue with the rifles are that some of the accessories which came with the item. The fore-grip for the rifle did not come with the adjustment screw/bolt, and the laser that was included with the item is the wrong laser. The for-grip is loose since I am unable to tighten it, and the laser that I received was a basic laser with an on off switch. The actual laser that was expected is supposed to be adjustable with the use of an allen wrench. This is was not an accident during the packaging of the items, because of the fact that i purchased two of the same.Overall I am happy with the purchase."
3,Nice but not what I thought,This was suppose to be a gift for my grandson for Xmas the only reason I am returning it is it's not exactly what he wanted so back it goes.
3,question regarding recent purchase,does this airsoft rifle have front and rear take down pins for the upper and lower reciever like the original does in other words can the top reciever be seperated from the bottom like the original ar 15 or m16 by removing the holding pins on lower reciever?
4,shipping,"they shipped out my package and they kept it at the same spot for a day but other wise the gun is great i would recommend you get it for beginnersAirsoft M16-A4 Spring Rifle W/Laser, LED ILLUMINATOR NEW SR-5207"
5,question,does this gun have a speed loader? also are there sights besides the laser? how do you cock this gun?
2,Not very happy with...,"Compared to other airsoft gun I bought after buying this the plastic was very brittle and my son had this broke in half with in the first couple weeks, compared to other guns we still have that seem built of better materials."
1,Don't Buy,I bought this gun about 3 weeks ago . It arrived broke and did not work out of the box. I was contacted by Airsplat to call/email.. Which I did and Still nothing has been resolved. I dont recommend this product nor do I recommend Airsplat for very poor Customer service.This was a complete waste of money with no refund or product replacement by far the worst Amazon dealings so far.
1,flashlight broke after 4 days,"flashlight broke after 4 days, I think the light bulb is a low quality material. It was a really nice blue light at first but did not turn on by the 4th day."
1,DO NOT GET THIS GUN!!!!!,this gun is horible the front stock is allways loose the led only works half the time the red dot fludders and it cant cut past a bush all in all a horible gun
5,Air soft,For the price this is a good purchase. I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and when it arrived it looked to be for an older person so I keep it at my house and only let him use it when there is an adult around somehow I missed the age on the gun it is well worth the money but I think the age is correct it should be for an adult.
1,airsoft gun,it did not work as semi auto or just auto so i do not recomend this gun for anyone who is looking for an automatic airsoft gun
1,crap,"At first site and figuring out how it all goes together (because the instructions are lame), I thought is was the coolest thing. Heavy and realistic. However............. total crap after firing it only 5 times. The bbs jammed up in it. Tried calling the center but all numbers from the info sheet that came with the item, were disconnected. So emailed both the site of actual item and Amazon as well. Instead of fixing the item, I was given back the money and nothing was talked of about the purchase. I am of course thankful for the money back but I really would have liked it handled a different way. I am not too thrilled about there service at all and will not be going through them again for ANY purchases."
3,Not what you would expect,"So this gun is pretty stupid. First of all the package it was sent in was really cheap and wrapped in packing paper. Next I'd like to inform you about the laser sight, it is quite possibly the hardest thing to put on any airsoft gun ever. Now let's get on the subject of quality, the gun has no accuracy whatsoever and half the time it won't even shoot. The plastic is also very cheap. I can buy an M4 and pistol for less right now at Wal-Mart that is better than this one. In other words save your money"
4,PRETTY GOOD FOR THE PRICE,"I BOUGHT 4 OF THESE GUNS FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE TO ADMIT ITS PRETTY GOOD THE POWER OF THE GUN IS GREAT AND ITS GOT GREAT ACCURACY THE LED LIGHT IS STRONG AND THE FACT ITS BLUE IS COOL THE LASER HAS A BIT OF A FAULTY WIRE SO WHEN YOU WANT TO USE IT YOU HAVE TO TURN THE BACK PART, THE MAGAZINE HOLDS ALOT OF BB'S BUT IT ONLY ALLOWS ABOUT TWENTY SHOTS THEN YOU HAVE TO SHAKE TO RELOAD, THE ONLY BIG DOWNSIDE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO RECOCK THE GUN EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO TAKE A SHOT OTHER THAN THAT ITS A KICKASS GUN"
3,Someone help!,My gun was working fine until bbs got jammed into i think the barrel or some other part and 10 or more bbs are in it. Can someone help me how to remove the bbs and or take apart the gun if necessary?!?!?
5,Epic gun,"This gun is great! I got it today, tried it out, i was blown away from the FPS. I shot it across my backyard. I recomend buying this gun!"
3,its ok,its a really nice gun... but its made out cheap plastic. i would only by this gun if you want shoot one bb then reload and so one. thats all i want to say about it.
4,Great Gun,"Great gun, Just got it today only took 5 days to get here (Ordered it Sunday night for it friday at 2:50.) Shot holes in a pop can from 20 feet away and it is dead on accurate (I am using 6mm .20gram bb's.) Only downside it that the strap is a little small and the laser came broken which i was kind of mad about. Also i was dissapointed that it did not come with a scope, but the iron sights are pretty cool. Love the LED light and the adjustable stock."
5,Great gun for the price!,"(review written by my son who uses the airsoft gun)The gun came 5 days after it shipped as we expected. It came with several attachments that you can put on other air soft guns.(not automatic)shoots about 150ft. and is very fast.Easy to reload and the clip really holds a lot. We got the laser on it but it didn't work after about five minutes so we were were able to order a new one from the company for free that is actually nicer even though we soldered it back together while it was shipping. ail in all,Great gun!!!"
5,Awesome gun!!!,"This is an awesome gun, the power is pretty good and it comes with some BBs plus the battery, definitely worth the price for the gun, and the shipping is very fast too, and it comes with this awesome box!!!"
1,"DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM.... DO NOT ORDER FROM ""HOT IMPORT TOYS""!!","We bought this airsoft rifle for our 10-year-old son (who has been trained to use and care for his possessions appropriately :-). We had read the Amazon reviews and believed we were getting a great value for the money.He opened it on Christmas morning, and was thrilled to try it, as soon as he could bring it outdoors. A few hours later, after only about 20 minutes of continuous use, the charging handle (which loads each airsoft BB into the chamber) BROKE! I tried to reach the seller (Hot Import Toys at 877-448-4867) -- THREE (3) TIMES -- to arrange a return, and each time I was put on hold for a minute or so, then the voice prompt said ""there is no one here to take your call... Good-bye. [click]""So now I'm thinking ""Great -- we just spent $30 for a big black plastic paper-weight!""SAVE YOURSELF... Don't buy from this seller, and don't buy this item!!"
2,decent probaly not though,ok this gun is ok. to put bbs in mag is easy but you have to shake bbs in the area which holds the ready to shoot bbs.its around 290 300 fps my but stock broke off from dropping 1 foot into grass honestly dont get it its a waste i got a c02 pistol 400 fps for that muchdont buy
3,It's okay,Expected a more realistic gun. Missing screws to secure the front handle on tight. Batteries dead. Thought gun was semi auto/auto. It's only a single shot. Best stick to pellet guns.
2,Cheap is Cheap,"It shoots, and is slightly accurate. I guess with this gun you get what you pay for, buy cheap, get a cheap product. This is very flimsy, red dot sight is garbage and isn't powerful in the least. I recommend checking out a different gun besides this one. Very cheap, not even worth the 15 or 20 bucks i paid for it."
5,m16-a4 airsoft gun,"this gun is sooooooo cool, the only bad thing is that the instructions are in chinese but other than that it is sooooooooooooo awesome"
4,Yummy!,"It really does smell like chocolate, yummy!!! I thought a product like this would be like many of its kind, impossible to wash excess out of my hair, but I was so wrong. It rinses easily and does not excessively weigh down my fine hair. Leaves my color treated hair soft, shiny, and more manageable. It will last longer then the label says it will. I have long hair (mid-back) and use a generous amount as recommended and I've already used it twice the amount of times it says it will last and I still have some left.Amazon has the best deal on this stuff, 1 bottle of this costs about $16-$19 other places, while you get 2 here for just under $22."
5,Best Hank Thompson,My husband has been looking for years for a Hank Thompson CD. He is so happy with this one because it has all his greatest hits.
4,Smells Great!,"I bought about $50 worth of Mrs. Meyer's products on a special promotion and I couldn't be happier. By far my favorite is the Lemon Verbena counter spray. What a great, clean scent and it cuts grease better than most others. Doesn't leave a greasy shine, just clean. I agree with other reviewers that lavender doesn't smell as expected but it does clean. The fabric softener is nice although you need VERY LITTLE! I highly recommend this lemon verbena counter spray. Plan on getting a bigger size next time."
2,"A feminist, anti-religious look at small town life.","The main character in this book was born in 1965, but the attitudes she is raised with are from the 1940's. Her views of the Catholic Church are outdated and sterotyped and so are most of the characters in this book. Because of the characters' feminist views, she disavows all organized religion. She also paints a very bleak picture of marriage and it is amazing that this character even gets married and has children. This book is just another depressing story about a disfunctional family."
4,Reads like a memoir but it is fiction,I read this book a while back so I don't remember it very well..but I do remember thinking this book was very real--so much so that it felt like I was reading a memoir. I shared it with my Mom and my really good friend and both agree reading it felt like you were reading a memoir.
3,"So-so story, but well-crafted writing","I initially purchased this book because I am from the same community as the author (and, in fact, very distantly related to her through the marriages that often happen in small-town America.) However, I've never met her.While I think she is a very sound writer, I found the actual story, the plot, quite dull and predictable. For me, the saving grace was actually recognizing some of the places she writes about, even though she doesn't literally name them. She also has a true knack for description and characterization, even if the plot left me a little cold. Perhaps this is simply not a style that personally appeals to me."
1,Slow start set the pace . . .,"This book started off slow and I read about 1/3 of the book until I was interested in the story at all. While the writing is very descriptive, the author does not engage the reader by developing empathy for the characters. Not recommended."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"In light of Vinegar Hill, I was somewhat disappointed in this novel. Although Vinegar Hill was utterly depressing, I found that it was better written than this novel. Perhaps the authors writing technique had matured some between this novel and Vinegar Hill or perhaps she had different editors. I found this novel to be somewhat disjointed and a little difficult to read. The author seemed to jump from one topic to another sometimes even within the same paragraph. Although there was a transformation between the parents from the beginning to the end of the book, I had a difficult time understanding the basis for such a drastic change in their beliefs and personalities."
5,Black Wax,"Gil Scott-Heron is a genius! This DVD is great because not only do you get to see him and his AMAZING band perform, but you get to see his personality as he shows you around Washington D.C. If you're a fan of Gil, you should own this."
5,this Book is great when we try to understand corrosion item,I am used to read this book since to start corrosion study.
2,Disappointing,"The opening few minutes seem promising, but the video quickly declines into either uninteresting and overlong shots from train windows or story lines drawn out longer than interest justifies. What we are left with is basically a home movie, although of professional quality, centred on a limited group of characters in the countryside. It would have been far more interesting if the producers had widened the scope to take in more people and places in the regions covered."
3,Rural Russia,A journey by train and then by boat into the heart of the Russian countryside. A good insight into the typical aspects of rural life although the narrator can't resist lecturing on the necessity of `progress' as most visitors to Russia seem compelled to do. A visit to a rural prison is particularly insightful although the quality of the material wanes alittle at the end with a ten minute discussion around a campfire revolving around the possible capture of a frog that briefly appeared.
5,Fast shipping and fit perfectly,"Fast shipping and fit perfectly.Took about 1/2 an hour to install just because I did it myself (was pissed at the significant other at the time).Just be careful tight the bolts from the bracket to the bar itself.The bracket bolts going on to the vehicle take allot of torque and that may lead you to apply the same force to the light bar bolts as they're about the same size but don't.There is a metal tab welded with a heavy nut welded to it and although it is very well constructed, you are still limited by the tube wall so you can rip the tab if you over torque it.This is a very well made product and looks good on the truck!"
1,DOES NOT FIT.,"DO NOT TRUST Amazon's ""does it fit your truck"" option. I entered in my specs to see if it would fit my vehicle and it says it does ""2003 Ford Explorer Sport Trac"" BUT IT DOES NOT! Call Westin and get the correct part number for your vehicle. Amazon can't get it right and I got nothing for their screw up except a refund. Whoopie. Doesn't help the fact that I was recommended the wrong part for the 3rd time..."
2,To much money for what it is..,Wish it had more words.. Mostly water sounds. I wouldn't have bought it if I would of had the chance to use it once. This might work for some but not me.
2,nothing yet,"Have used other CD's before that I have had success with. thought this DVD and CD version might be more up to date. so far, no change, and that is disappointing. i really expected some changes and nothing yet. I will probably purchase just a subliminal CD; that is what I had used in the past that really worked for me. the images on the DVD are beautiful; but did nothing to help with eating or exercises habits."
1,Didn't Work for Me!,"I used the program as recommended and it did not produce any changes. In the past, I had success with another subliminal tape and thought this would work just as well. It didn't. I wonder why some people benefit and others don't!"
2,Poor Production Values,"I have used sublminal videos and sublminal CDs for over ten years now. The quality of this video is poor - you can SEE the supposed subliminal pictures - and the music quality is that of bad lounge music. I would NOT recommend this purchase,"
1,Ummm....NO!,"This DVD did not work for me. The tedious voice repeating the same thing over and over was aggrevating! Same with the CD. I've forced myself to watch the DVD and listen to the CD for 3 weeks now and noticed nothing different in my habits, cravings or otherwise."
1,disappointed,"I am disappointed, purchased based on reviews only to find the one I received was not subliminal, was very distracting to hear the words that should be subliminal. I have returned for refund."
1,Didn't work for me,"I used this CD & DVD religiously, without fail, every day for nearly 40 days. I do not notice a difference. I'm so disappointed."
4,Very relaxing and helpful,"Though not a miracle cure, it definately help me focus and feel more relaxed about losing weight and feeling relaxed in general. I find it easier to say no to overeating especially late night splurges."
2,Emotionless weak singing,"Here Minter makes Handel seem lifeless and colorless. Although he is rather musical, his voice lacks a male incisiveness and is soft, with a rather limited expressive range. The overall effect is flaccid and lifeless, especially in the great dramatic arias from Giulio Cesare and Rodelinda."
2,This is NOT the Best of Sparks!,"This album is simply a repackaging of an album called 'Music That You Can Dance To"", and is not one of Sparks' best efforts. This synthesizer-laden effort is best directed to die-hard fans that like those kind of tunes. Traditional Sparks fans who enjoy Sparks' rock and roll side will be very disappointed. Lastly, the usually hysterical lyrics are almost totally absent here."
1,"NOT the best of, and not even among the better of. WOOF!","Here's some sage advice when you're shopping for music. If it's on the Curb label, caveot emptor. Most of their releases are very short and are either blatently mislabeled (such as this CD) or else consist of re-recordings. This CD reissues the generally miserable ""Music You Can Dance To"", possibly the nadir of the Sparks catalogue. It's not the best of. Perhaps it could legitimately be called ""The Best of the one album that Sparks released on Curb records"". But it isn't.dap"
