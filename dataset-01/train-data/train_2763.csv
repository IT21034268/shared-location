4,Fear in Space,"So, I have a 54 inch G10 Panasonic calibrated and a bose suround the affects and sound was just amazing. My friends was jumping left and right. I understood why the mutation took her a little time to figure it out after I had to explain about the supplement they were given to adapt and speed up there evolution adapting when they landed on the planet but if your stuck in dark dim wit nnothing to eat but each other you the chemical is going to make u adapt to that.bummer they didn't explain why earth went dark!"
4,Great graphics ok storyline.,"The acting is ok, the graphics are beautiful, and the technology they portray is kinda fun. Its worth renting but not buying. Once you watch it you can guess the storyline pretty much. They did a good job on the makeup for the actors though, and even if your not interested in the story it is a decent movie to watch."
3,Event Horizon Meets The Descent,"If you liked Event Horizon and you liked The Descent, there's a decent chance you're going to like this.It has a bit more of a mystery, so it starts a little slow, but I think it's got great production value and direction. If you haven't checked out this director's previous flick ""Antibodies"", I'd also recommend that. (though it's subtitled, so be aware)Got the Blu-Ray for under $10, so I can't complain."
2,Outer Space meets The Descent creatures,This movie sucked it was really hard to follow what was going on at times and I am still confused. It starts off on a space craft head to Tilha a new planet carrying lots of people but something has went terribly wrong and people began waking up in a nightmare.One astronaunt wakes up and has lost of memory and is disoriented after coming to on board the space craft. Soon another person awakes and they try and figure out whats going on and what has happened to all the crew and people aboard the craft. When they finally realize whats happening on board the craft and whats on board with them the movie starts to get really creepy. The creatures look a lot like the creatures in (The Descent) 2005 one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately this move did not make it.
1,Worst Movie I've seen in a long time,"The first half of the movie you spend saying wtf over and over, and not the good kind where you want to find out what's going on, the wtf why am I watching this. No character development at all. And when it's over you're just so glad its over you don't even try to put the pieces together. There are so many other great movies in this genre don't waste time with this one"
1,How Many more insane captain sci fi flix they gonna make? OMG,"look,raise your hand if you saw Event Horizon *raises hand*raise your hand if you saw Supernova *raises handraise your hand if you saw Sunshine *raises hand*raise your hand if you saw Pandorum *raises hand*OMG, STOP WITH THE CREW/CAPTAINS GOING INSANE ALREADYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYsorry, they got to stop, i am not kiddingnot reviewing the blu ray, just the movie, at first i was intrigued, looked good until , those who saw know what i am talking about,sorry people, just sick of the same friggin movie over and overrrrrrrrrrr"
1,Truly Disappointed,"After reading all of the reviews, I honestly thought this would be a great Sci-Fi flick. Not even close. Now I know why the sellers gave me this film for $3. Granted, it would have made a great 3-or-4-part sitcom, but not a full-length film. The film was very dark...couldn't even see half of what was going on...and when the lighting was turned up, I wasn't sure if it was something I wanted to see anyway! LOL! Maybe I've seen way too many Sci-Fi flicks, but there were better films (directing, script and acting) in the 50's and 60's. If you're starved for a sci-fi (high budget) film, then watch this. If you want quality, go back and re-watch ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Alien"", or ""The Blob"". What a waste of time this was."
4,A good and scary movie - with just one minor gripe,"Pandorum is a good movie, for those who like hardcore SciFi movies and are not afraid of seeing things that jump at them from the dark.It was fun to watch and I keep coming back to the DVD from time to time to see selected scenes, like the first time Bower encounters the mutants.The movie has a few surprises in its plots, a few hard to predict turns. It has good atmosphere working for it, great sets and actors who really put up an effort. Even as SciFi goes its has a good story.The only thing I found to complain about was the originality. There wasn't really anything original in the film. Cyro chambers are a used a known element, mutants and Alien like monsters are a dime a dozen and wondering through a dark, half lit ship is also something that has been done many times before ...It is not a bad movie. Far from it. It's fun to watch and interesting. It's just not that original, if that sort of thing disturbs you."
4,Are we there yet,"A new colony for humans in space runs awry. The people are turning into highly evolved animals. Super strengthened creatures meet and eat newly awakening flight crews in space. The puzzle is who is who. The commander isn't who he says he is, nor is the man he rescues. Good, could have been better."
4,Surprisingly Good!,"I've had this film in my wish list for quite some time, and I decided to finally buy it. I was skeptical about this movie based on reviews that I read here on Amazon, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well done this movie actually is. Most reviewers have discussed the plot, so I'm not going to recite the storyline. The acting was pretty good. My only complaint about the film was some of the unnecessary hand-to-hand combat sequences and how the characters were not fully developed. Other than that it was definitely worth watching, and it is quite scary. I had that anxious ""someone watching me/looking over my shoulder"" feeling after the film ended, and, for a horror movie lover, it does not happen often. If you haven't seen it and are a fan of sci-fi/horror, then buy it. You won't be disappointed."
4,not an Alien rip off. Not that bad. Pretty damn good.,"Ok so i was expecting an Alien rip off. I got something else. The main charactor was the best lead i have seen since Avatar in Wizards. hes a charactor who you get his intentions but you dont realy care for cause he is kind of usless till the end. some other charactors where thrown in for meat for the grinder and for a nice ass. Denis Quade, like samuel l. they put him in every thing...Legion? but any way the *Spoiler* mutants were cool but reminded me of the cave men bat things in the Descent. big sets and realy dark lighting and some fun twists make for a good sci fi movie, but you cant expect to much when it has paul ws andersons backing behind it. i mean look what he did to avp."
4,Memories from the past,"Today I got this CD. Maybe the voices are not what they used to be. But anyhow, this is real music and it brings the sound from the days music was honest. I like most of the songs very much and I'm happy with these memories from the past."
2,Olympian nights long and dull,"This book is very short and frankly, not terribly interesting. It was doubtless fascinating to another audience many years ago, but not to me now."
1,Seriously ... No Subtitles,"I'm giving this Blu-ray (From Dusk till Dawn / From Dusk till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (Miramax Double Feature)) a one star because of a lack of subtitles. I have a four year old and two year old daughters. They like to play. They like to make lots of noise. They sometimes make a lot of noise or ask me questions when I'm trying to watch a movie. This movie is full of Texan speak so it's already hard enough to understand what they are saying but without subtitles and talking kids, it's almost impossible. The video quality is excellent, the audio quality is excellent, but no subtitles. I like this movie but unless it is perfectly quiet, I really can't watch it without subtitles.Update: Watched both movies while the girls were sleeping. They were great! Still need subtitles though."
4,Ok movie,This movie when I watched keep me in suspense the whole time. It is easy to follow with a drama that intrigues you. It is a good action movie.
2,Keep Looking,"Does not light up. You can only read it at certain angles. Concept is great, the product is not."
4,Not bad for the price.,For the money this is a good unit. At first it took a little time to get it set up and pair the phone with the base unit. At first I had a lot of static on the phone and the ring tones would not work. I unplugged the battery and it worked fine. I had trouble getting the outside temperature working. After resetting and pressing the number of stations it registerd and has stayed registered. The inside temperature is not accurate. The alarm clock works great. All in all I would recommend the unit.
1,Oregon Scientific,One phone didnt work out of the box. The other phone doesnt work very well. The company oregon scientific no longer sells or makes these phones? There is no need to ask why......The phone looks nice but that is about it!
2,not favorable,The phone had a static that made it unusable. Also the clock in the dark was unable to read. When the snooze depressed the light came on as a back ground light and made the time unable to read.The unit was returned for these reasons.
1,HAlf-worked for a week and then fizzled out,"My unit has never worked as a phone and only worked intermittantly as a weather station. It only ever received a signal from the outside monitor for about a week, then nada!A complete waste of money - buy something else"
3,Good but Not Great,Great ninja action but for that price it should have been restored or remastered to restore contrast & color.
4,a little grainy in places but still good.,"Shinichi ""Sonny"" Chiba in one of his most famous roles. When this was played in California in the 80's for the first time it brought Sonny Chiba & ninjas further into american culture, AND, created a cult following! A must have for fans of the genre!"
5,kage no gunden,"i was very satisfied with this DVD . it had all action and great acting with sunny Chiba i remember back in the ""80""s .looking forward to season 2 of this series !!!"
2,What subtitles?,I presume that the previous reviewers all spoke Japanese. That's about the only way you will understand this series. The English subtitles are completely unreadable and useless. What a waste!
5,"Qigong For Healing, Lisa B. O'Shea",I bought this DVD after having several Qigong Healing sessions with Lisa and wanted to learn more about Qigong. Lisa explains Qigong energy healing in an easy to understand manner that allows a novice like myself to follow along and begin to learn some of the basic Qigong movements. I would recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in Qigong whether they are a beginner or advanced student. Lisa's relaxed style and thorough explanations make this an enjoyable and educational experience.
5,Definitely worth a read!,"This is a great sourcebook for anyone who plays a spellcaster or runs a game in which spellcsters play a significant role. Each section introduces a new and different way in which magic can be incorporated into a campaign. I plan on using a LOT of the source material in my campaign, and I strongly encourage other game masters to check it out and do the same. It is WELL worth the money."
4,Replacement Flojet water pump,"I bought the pump as a direct replacement for the original in my motor home. The old pump had an internal leak which caused it to cycle continously withouy any faucets turned on. The new one appears to work properly by design, and time will tell whether the design has any flaws.As always the Amazon shopping experience was good, although I later found the same pump for less."
1,Poor quality lens,The increase in magnification is impressive but the quality of the picture is very poor. The photos' look as if they have been taken through a soft focus filter and the edges around the objects suffer from a rainbow effect.
2,Telephoto Lens,"Makes good pictures, however the lens can come off the camera due to not enough threads holding the lens to the camera base"
3,Ripping off The Stand,"Don't bother with this book. While the author writes well the plot (as mentioned by others) is pretty much The Stand just abbreviated. Some of the characters even seem to be similar. It's ok to have the same general idea, just don't bother going where someone like King has already been."
3,Writer with Talent,"This book has some great characters, scenes and images, but the story falls flat in places. I've read other books by D.A. Stern and think he is a talented writer. While I think that this book could have used a strong editor, it was still pretty good read in this genre."
2,A real disappointment,"I bought this book with the idea that it would be another good ""doomsday"" type thriller. It did fulfill that promise to some degree but the ending was so vague that I was sorry I wasted the time reading the book. The author never really defines the ""evil force"" destroying the country. It is a mediocre book that could have been much better."
2,King and McCammon did this better,"I know Stephen King has been accused of being too wordy; but that kind of wordiness was needed in this book. It could be just me; but I didn't really feel you could connect with--or even keep track of--some of the characters. I thought the ending was very unsatisfying. King's The Stand and Robert McCammon's Swan Song were much better examples of ""end of the world"" novels; and personally, I think your time would be better spent re-reading those books than reading this one."
4,End of the World?,"Believable characters who connect with each other on their different journeys make for some frightening, but ultimately satisfying reading. The end of the world as we know it may be on its way ,but there is promise of a future for a better world to come. The present terrors which the author evokes occur because of a fabled and bloody past. realistically presented.A good and satisfying read.."
4,WOW,"The beginning was a little slow but this book has the action that I think no other book has had. The content in this book is intense and at the same time disturbing. The ending in this book is easy to understand you just have to be open minded. This book isn't just good vs evil, its also the characters stuggles with there lives. The author has so many characters because he doesn't want you to be stuck with just one person. But he wants to make it unexpeceted he wants to do things that you don't expect. You may be caught with a character with half the book and then poof dead.D.A. Stern DOES NOT copy ""The Stand"" but no doubt it is an end of the world ending, horror, thriller, action book. But there is religious matters in the book ( what kind book would it be with out the matters of God and the devil fighting.). But I would strongly push this book to any one."
3,"Close, no cigar","CLose to being a terrific book, and because it some so close it is annoying when it lets you down near the end. IMHO ""Night of the Beast"" by Harry Shannon is a much better read for 2002, and although not an end-of-the-world tale, is vastly more entertaining. I will buy soemthing else by Stern, but this one needed an editor."
4,How can you not get grabbed by it?,"The only reason I picked up the book to begin with was simply because of the stunning graphics of the cover that caught the eye. When I sat down to read it, I was caught up in this epic end-of-the-world battle. My only problem with it was the convoluted nature of the plot. Starting out with a wonderful premise, the author loses the point of the desperate nature of the story by miring it down in too many details and too much of a convoluted plot. Otherwise, I adored the book."
2,An initially engrossing novel that manages to fall flat,"Now and then I pick up a book solely based the the cover. I had never heard of the author but upon reading the blurb it sounded like something similar to McCammon's Swan Song, one of my favorite novels of all time. The story is initially very ambitious, introducing many characters and plot lines. But it seems that just when you are really getting into the characters, it suddenly hits you that there are only a hundred or so pages left in the book. It's like when you are watching a show on television and you suddenly realize that there are only five minutes left and they still haven't got Timmy out of the well... Needless to say, the ending feels rushed and is very unsatisfying. Better ""end of the world"" novels would include Niven and Pournelle's ""Lucifer's Hammer"", King's ""The Stand"", and McCammon's ""Swan Song""."
2,Review-Black Dawn,"Page 1 gets you excited! It sounds as if it's going to be one heck of a book. Character building is well done.....and overdone. Basically, the characters are built and the good guys die one by one...and it leaves you wondering, why? If this is a book about good vs. evil, I don't think the good guys won and I'm not really sure who the bad guy was! All in all, I was left very confused at the end of the book and wondering why this book that showed such promise fell flat on its face."
2,Who knew Armageddon could be so boring?,"It picks up a bit as it goes, mostly by killing its major characters off in an ever faster pace as the ending approaches, but the ending that does come is vague and more than a bit confusing.Also, the Anti-Christ figure should be dark and menacing, not come off like a spoiled child with nothing better to do. Only the characteres of Thomas and Abby are mildly interesting.Major plothole: At one point, Abby tries to save the day but instead makes things worse. Recognizing this, she does another fix that ""makes things better."" However, if you do the math carefully, you'll see she didn't.Read THE STAND or SWAN SONG. Take this to the used bookstore."
1,The First Book I Ever Hated,I know that sounds bad but it is true this is the first book I ever hated. The plot was thin and poorley drawn together. I had never read an awful book till this one. It's as though he wanted to write some sweeping apocolyptic epic (The Stand for instance like other users have said) but was just to lazy to rope it all together or go into any sort of detail.
2,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"I bought this starter kit to give Art of Shaving a try while on vacation. I had been using another brand (1/2 the price) a couple of weeks before vacation, so I knew how to wet shave. The first use produced an awful smell, thought it was the brush, so I washed it with gentle shampoo a few times. The awful smell continued; it was the shave cream! The shave cream does not lather up as well as other less expensive brands (tried 5 other brands and they all lather better than Art of Shaving). There really is no need to use the oil, I got just a close of a shave using other brands without shave oil. The brush was not as bad as other reviews, will be useful for traveling. The balm did a good job. I would not recommend Art of Shaving."
4,A fun gift to introduce someone to foam shaving,"I got lavender for myself and sandalwood for my Dad and we both enjoyed using the foam brushes. The shaving foam that is included is also pretty good. The oil is very smoothing. Overall it was a good experience.The brush itself was obviously not meant to last longer than the products in the package. It will get you through the included foam, but is definitely not a quality brush. The bristles will fall out. OK for beginners though.If you are ready to step into the straight shaving world be sure to get this:[...]"
3,"Nice, but not worth the $$$","After reading lots of reviews praising this brand, I thought I'd give it a try.In short, it is superior to your store brand products but not enough to justify the astronomical cost, in my opinion. I'm glad I tried the ""starter kit"" first and the company gets my praises for offering a trail size. But, there are several other less expensive options that deliver similar results. American Crew is one for example. I will give the sandalwood +1 on the scent though. It does smell very nice!"
3,Not bad.,"My husband has sensitive skin and I thought this would really help. The only thing he did not like was the aftershave. Whatever is in it burnt his skin for over an hour, then it was a deep red in color for about another hour because of an allergic reaction. Not good for sensitive skin!"
1,OVER PRICED,"Thought that this kit would be FULL SIZE for price (can find in Nordstrom for $100), only to discover that it is just the ""TRIAL SIZE"" available for $25.00. So disappointed, misleading description."
4,Ms. Ray Does it Again,"I really enjoyed reading ""I know who holds Tomorrow"" It was a departure from most of the novels I've read from Ms. Ray. I've read most of her work,too. This novel was fresh and new for Ms. Ray. The development of the numerous players was fresh, new,and honest. I tried throughout the book to figure out the mysteries. I was tempted to jump to the need of the book but hung in there to the end. It was worth every word and every page."
4,This is a keeper!,"I knew I had to have this book as soon as I read a review in a magazine. The late night trip to the book store was worth it. This book surprised me, angered me, and made me cry a little bit, too. Franis Ray is a superb writer who gives Black readers what we want; she's mainstream but she doens't sacrifice substance in her novels. The characters in this book have real emotions that I could get next too; the burgeoning love affair between 'mother' and child was great. Not too many women would be able to handle a situation like that.If I'm being vague, it's because you need to read the book. Enjoy!"
3,Deep but . . .,"Francis Ray is a great storyteller and this story is no exception -- except this time it's just not a very believable story. How many women would knowingly raise another woman's child knowing that the child was conceived by one's own husband? None that I know. Did anyone see the play ""Fences""? Do any of you recall the reactions of the audience?On that note - keep up the good work Ms. Ray as I always expect greatness from you."
2,i must say this.......,"This is the 1st Francis Ray book I have read that has taken me longer than 2 days to finish. I wouldn't tell someone not to buy it, But i didn't like this one. reason is it took way to long to get to the point with Zac i mean really, that twist was ehhhhh. she introduce people but then left there story line hanging! I wonder if this is one of her first books, because this one was hard for me to get threw. Madison needed a back bone I mean really she had men walking all over her in this book. matter if fact none of the women in this book had back bones when it came to the men. It could have been soo much better i expected more.............oh i wanted it to be more."
5,A great writer,"Wes and Madison Reed betray the perfect newscaster couple when in public but, it's a whole other story when behind closed doors. Madison is suffering from going through a miscarriage and withdraws from Wes. Wes is in the process of receiving a promotion and wants Madison to follow him to another state for them to work as a team. Madison is not keen on the idea but, before she can make a decision, her world begins to unravel.Read this thought provoked novel, to find out how Madison handle her husband's death and what she will do with her husband's child by another women."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!,"This book was a complete waste of my time. It took me almost 4 months to finish reading this book. Unfortunately, I can never get the time back!From the summary, the book sounded very good: A man on his death bed, who makes a confession to his wife about having a child out of wedlock and a lover. Very interesting, right? Wrong! The plot was good for the 1st 5 pages of the book. Afterwards, it was downhill from there. The author failed to capture my imagination with premature adjectives. The characters were under-developed. The author did not allow each character to fully develop.Although, I gave this book 1 star, it was one star too many!!!!!"
2,Horrible reception....,"I just received this item from Globazar and although the delivery was good I am returning it asap. I have a Motorola Rizr Z3 and was able to set it up just fine but the reception is horrible. When headset is on my ear people can bearly hear me. They can hear my voice very distant and some static. Once the headset is near my mouth then they can hear me just fine. The purpose of it is to talk handsfree but obviously it's impossible. Therefore, I donnot recommend this item, especially if you own a Motorola Rizr Z3."
3,Go big or go home,"Not as good as it should be. Bought it for the wife, she liked the pink color. I opted for the H700. H700 way easier to use, longer range, holds a charge better."
2,Sent it back.,"My husband bought the jawbone for me for Christmas based on the website hype. The very first time I charged it the plug cover came off with the plug. I didn't want to send it back and thought that I would glue it back on, until I read some of the other reviews... I didn't want to spend my time worrying when the next thing would break on it. So sadly sent it back. Will buy a plantronics."
1,Defective,I got a cell phone earpiece for my daughter for Christmas. It doesn't work. The company was very accomodating about the return. We haven't received the replacement yet so I can't comment on that.
1,doesn't work well,"The first week I got this, I loved it. But then a rain storm entered the area and it didn't work well. could hardly hear and the people I talked to couldn't hear me at all. Well come to find out if there is a cloud anywhere in the sky, I have horrible reception. Bought a second one and it is just the same. So I know its not that a I got a bad one, but the entire line doesn't work if the atmosphere doesn't cooperate with me. Decided to go to an earbud - at least the people can hear me! Save your money for something else. Cute yes, but why have it if it doesn't work!"
2,Uncomfortable,This Pink Motorola H500 Bluetooth headset looks great but is very uncomfortable to use. It barely holds onto the ear and every time you turn your head it feels like it will fly off of your ear. Not so good to use unless you can hold onto it all of the time while turning your head.
2,Motorola H500 Bluetooth (Soft Pink),"The delivery was on time, but it was not in the original package, it was in a bag. When I opened the package I noticed a Bluetooth had scratches on it. When I charge the battery,it did not take that long to charge. The sound quality was real bad, even when I turn the volume all the way up, it had a lot of static, I had trouble hearing my friend on the other side,This is the second Bluetooth I bought, the first one didn't work at all, it would not charge, but I did not get a chance to send it back on time, so I kept it and just reordered a new one. I guess this particular model has bad sound quality because I read the review on similar Bluetooth's and all of them had bad reviews on the sound quality, so I would not be ordering another one like this in the future."
3,MotorolaH500,This bluetooth is nice.I like how it fits in my ear. On occasions however it just disconnect with my phone for no reason.
2,item not as discribed,the Bluetooth is really scratched up and worn! its barely able to see the mortorala symbol!in the description it said that it was refurbed not physically damaged. is there anything i can do about this?
4,works great,have had no problems with it. my daughter loves it and uses it. she was able to pair it without any problems
2,Bad sound.,"It lasted for less than a year and I always had trouble hearing people. It never sat well on my ear, no matter how I adjusted it. Luckily, it was less than $20, so no big loss. I was disappointed because I expected better from Motorola. The volume control was awful. It never seemed to make much of a difference. I wouldn't recommend it at all."
4,No Surprises Here...,"Pros: (These were expected to begin with so no surprises) Comforting material where it comes in contact with the ear. Easy to use with step by step instructions. Comes with simple charger/adapter. Headset works well with my Motorola Razr L7 cell phone. Sound is loud and clear on other end, and person on other side can hear me (indoors -> Not sure about outdoors yet).Cons: Metallic silver color on headset easily began to rub off after only 3 uses (that area is made tacky with cheap material.) Ear loop is slightly big for my small ears so it tends to feel like its falling off. In comparison with many Motorola headset models, this one is quite big in size. That is why it's heavier than I expected. Thickness it's about two of my fat fingers placed together (wider than my thumb) and height, it's about the length of my whole thumb. Buzzing sound when I turn the volume louder to hear person on other side. (can be dealt with)"
3,Moderately OK.,"I purchased this bluetooth as a gift for a family member's Sony Ericsson cell phone. We had to play around with it at first to get it working properly. She still has minor issues with the headset, but overall she likes it.We decided not to return the headset because I did pair it with my iPhone 3G, after three attempts, without using the passcode. I was able to use most features easily, with clear reception. So the earpiece isn't defective. The price was to good as well.Buyer beware, and do the research on the pairing capibilities with your electronic device and this bluetooth."
2,don't buy,"I purchased this to replace the one I lost that was exactly like it. Apparently they weren't made to the same quality standards. The voice/sound recognition on this one is terrible. I can't make any calls by voice command on it, and that defeats my purpose for using it. I will be replacing it today."
1,Can you hear me now?,"Other than the headset microphone not picking up my voice unless I hold it and yell directly into the mic, it worked great. Definitely low end. Used it with an LG phone."
2,not as good as i thought,"I bought this for my wife for christmas and i am disapointed in the voice quality. When she is in the car talking to me on it I can barely hear her because of the car noise and even with her having the radio on low it is still annoying to hear everything in the background. For the almost $50 price tag i thought it would be better quality since it was the step up from the entry level bluetooth. I also havent found how to put it on the left ear yet, i feel like i am going to break it if i try to pull the ear loop off.I would recommend spending another $40 and buying the Jawbone bluetooth. I got one as a present and it works great and fits better on my ear. I drastically reduces background noise.Overall, I am not impressed by motorola and thought they would make a better bluetooth for this price."
5,Great Product,"Product does what it's supposed to do. I have not had any problems thus far. I would definitely recommend this product to others. Plus, I love the pink, very girly!"
4,Works great!,"The product arrived before the promised date and worked as soon as I charged up the battery. It's sturdy enough to toss in my purse and not break it, yet small enough to not be annoying while I'm wearing it. It was exactly what I expected from the description and I like it much better than other headsets I've bought (and lost or broke). If there is any warning from my experience, it would be that I need to try to get in the habit of not grabbing it by the back edges when I trying to adjust it as that's where the volume buttons are. Other than that, it's just right. I use it with my 8700 blackberry."
3,To be returned...,"Bought @ Verizon store, found cheaper online. Sound quality is okay, but ambient noise is definately an issue. Had to constantly push the phone against my ear to hear while driving. Also, everyone I called said it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel the minute I left my car, so walking is definately not an option. Accidentally hung up on people repeatedly. Charge time is no more than 2-3 hours, no matter what they clainm, and I made sure to fully charge nightly."
2,The Bluetooth is ok,I like the color!! But I'm not happy about how it just sits on the ear. I thought it was one that fits into your ear.
4,Pink H500 Motorola bluetooth headset,"Linking the bluetooth to my Sony Vaio laptop is great!Also using it as a headhead it has easy to follow instuctions and link it with your cellular phone.Ladies each ear piece really fits differently on each person, so I'd recommend also to stop by @ a phone store ... I love it!"
2,Not as good as expected,Thought the sound quality would be better and that it would be easier to use. My wife had difficulty with the volume settings and with it staying on her ear.
3,great sound,This fits comfortably on earand delivers great sound and the microphone works great. Everyone says not to talk so loud!
2,"Love the fit, hate the power life","Thought I found the perfect head set. It's a great fit for my ear and long hair. Unfortunately the headset kept running out of juice by 11:00am. After only 3 hrs. of use it dies! So frustrating, can't use the car charger - so what's the purpose? Even after charging this all night, it would only last a few hrs. You get what you pay for."
2,"i keep talking, but no one can hear me!","this item was adorable and pink, and seemed to have some good reviews and the price was right, but i was extremely disappointed. i used it with my old treo 650 and it seemed to work okay, although it not only picked up my voice, but ALL of the background noise around me. i thus could only use it in a very quiet places (i.e. my home or car). i then got a treo 700 and this device completely screwed up my phone. when i set it up with my phone, i could no longer use the call waiting function on my phone for whatever reason. it also never stayed on my ear. my ears are small, and it seems to be made for individuals with much bigger ears."
1,won't stay on my ear,"The sound quality was okay. It definitely wasn't outstanding, but I would have lived with it if the darn device would stay on my ear. It has a little plastic hook that goes over the ear. It is easy to put on, but must be made for much bigger or differently shaped ears than mine. If I tilt my head back (such as when I take a drink from a water bottle), it falls off. If I lean to the side (as in grabbing something from the glovebox during a long traffic light), it falls off. If I bend forward, it falls off. If I make any sudden movements, it falls off. So, back to the search for the perfect bluetooth headset. By the way, it did pair nicely with my Blackjack -- if your ear fits their plastic hook, it is an inexpensive and serviceable unit."
1,Unhappy,I was excited to buy this cute pick Bluetooth until i used it. Can i say Echo the whole entire time your talking on the phone... So am back online looking for another Bluetooth one that does not Echo ... this one does. i would not recommend it... unless you like to hear yourself talk.
4,Works great with the Motorola Razor...Love the Pink!,"This headset is fantastic with the Motorola Razor, but does not work very well with a Palm Treo. I had a Jarba, which died for no apparent reason that worked, to an extent, but the sound quality, mainly the volume, was not good. According to some sources, none of the wireless headsets are very compatible with the Treos, except for maybe the headset specifically designed for Palm, which I hear are very expensive and bulky. If anyone knows of a headset that works well with the Palm Treo (meaning good sound quality, ergonomical, comfortable, etc.) please let me know at gentryonceagain@yahoo.com."
2,worked great for awhile but burned itself up within a couple of months,"it was great with my razor while it was working-but it overheated and I had to send it back for repair under warranty. -I have a nokia now and even tho I have read its compatable, the people I have tried to talk to while using it can't hear me at all thru the static and sqealing it makes. (which I can't hear on my end)"
3,at least it's pink...,"I got this because my city enacted a law prohibiting drivers from talking on cell phones, and because it sorta goes with my Razr phone. The two devices get to share chargers (wall and car), and they're both pink.At first I was very excited about having a bluetooth, because cradling the Razr between ear and shoulder really hurts your neck after a while!Overall, I guess this bluetooth works OK, but:- it doesn't stay on my ear very well- it turns on by itself in my purse pretty frequently- the beep when I'm in a Cingular ""dead spot"" is VERY annoying! (We have Native American reservations surrounding the city, which don't let us set up cell phone towers on their land, so you can imagine the spotty cell service we get.)- Motorola should know that the people who want pink phones & accessories will want them to look good together. My Cingular pink (a rich salmon shade) kinda clashes with the pale, cool pink of the bluetooth."
5,Great little hands free device at a great price,"This is a great little hands-free device. It is easy to use and works great. I can hear everyone on it and everyone says they can hear me. It's very light and comfortable and can easily be worn on either ear. Very convenient for the car and safer. Great price also from sellers on Amazon, I have seen the same product in retail stores for twice the price. Highly recommended!"
2,Not the greatest,"This was my second time buying this earpiece because the first one got destroyed. My second time around wasn't all that good with it (neither was the first). It was one of the first bluetooth earpieces and I'm sure the quality has improved with the newer ones.This earpiece creates noise in the background and sometimes the person on the other end can't hear me all that well. It's very convenenient, but I'm ready to get a newer product. I wouldn't recommend this earpiece to anyone. It's just.. not that great."
5,"BEST PRICES, FASTEST SHIPPING!",I BROUGHT THIS BLUETOOTH AND WAS VERY SATISFIED ALL AROUND. IT DID'NT COST MUCH AND I RECIEVED IT FAST! WILL DO BUSINESS AGAIN.
2,not very secure,"The speaker is loud and fairly clear, but the earpiece does not fit securely on my ear, which is very frustrating. I have talked to 2 other people who have the same problem with this product."
2,Buyers Beware,"I purchased the Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset about two months ago and I can't say that I'm impressed. The fit isn't so great and the sound quality is horrible. On the other hand, the headset can hold a charge for 2 days. Overall, I would not recommend buying the Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset."
2,A little overrated,"I heard that the motorola bluetooth is the best in the market, but I don't think anyone should pay more than $15.00 for it. To begin, unless your ear was the model for the Motorola, it won't fit your ear that well. Mine always feels loose. Secondly, Motorola claims that your phone can be 30 feet away from the bluetooth. This is not true in my case and I have difficulty hearing the person on the other line if I'm in another room in my house. Also, people who I speak with using the bluetooth have trouble hearing me. Another thing that sucks is that there's no bar or anything on the bluetooth indicating that you should charge it, so you're pretty much just guessing. Basically, you're paying nearly $60 more for a handsfree headset with no wire."
1,Terrible!,"Headset is VERY difficult to hear out of. Headsets are only convenient when you can get the models that ""connect"" with the phone when you open headset after it is folded. I have used Motorola HS810 and H700 and they are both great. This is terrible. I wish I could find the packaging to send it back. Don't waste your money. Cute color, bad product."
4,Good,This isnt a bad headset for the price. I works well. I like that when you hold down the button to turn it off/on it makes a noise in your ear signaling it is off/on. My other motorola H500 didnt have that feature and it was a pain because It was hard to know if it was off or on.
2,PINK BlueTooth headset,"this item just arrived and i will write a review after these products are opened on Christmas Day.I'm sure they're fine items and they're in a sealed package so I know they're new :) I bought this and another Blue Tooth for my husband and a charger, the 2 Bluetooths came in a box together BUT...the charger was not included and i purchased all these for an ""X"" amount for all 3 ..I hope they don't forget the charger..I'll get back to this review after I've recived the order complete and once I can open them:)I'll know I'll change the stars..I promise :)"
4,Satisfied customer,"This item came in on time, works great although disconnects by itself every now and . Good sound quality at a.great price."
3,Not the best bang for the buck,Got this as a gift for a friend and while it looks nice and she likes pink and all the audio quality is horrible. When we talk on the phone it sounds like she has a pillow in her face lol.
3,Reason for 3 stars,"First of all, I got this headset from one of Amazon's sponsors-cellphoneshop dot net. I liked the sound quality. I would speak to people on the mainland while in Hawaii and they had very few problems hearing me-even inside buildings.The 3 star rating is for the ""fit"" of the headset. It always felt loose-as someone else said-like it was going to fall off. If I was not moving/walking it was fine, but start to move and there it would slip.I shop Amazon often and when this was sold out, cellphoneshop had it for $18.99. It is still the same price as it was when I got mine. I am not sure about color choices though?I now use a very small Samsung which comes with a charging case. It was a ""freebie"" with a phone purchase and I like the fit much better.Hope this helps!"
3,Can you hear me now?,"My little pink bluetooth is so cute, but everyone has a hard time hearing me. I have a friend who has a better bluetooth and I can't even tell when he is using it. I think next time, I will pay the extra money and get a good one!"
4,COMFORTABLE EARPIECE,THE EAR PIECE IS NICE. YOU BARELY NOTICE THAT YOU'RE WEARING IT. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE VOLUME BUTTON DOESN'T WORK.
3,"works with palm treo, although static once in a while","I really like it, it fits over ear nicely so you forget it is there, the only thing is once in a while, it is so static sounding that you can't use it and I think it is when I am in the house and too close to the phone with it on. Other than that, it is great."
2,Not Impressed,I received my Bluetooth from Amazon and actually the whole purchasing/receiving process went really easy & quick. I am not very impressed with the performance of my headset though. People often cannot hear my when I'm talking on it & I usually have to repeat myself several times. My sister on the other hand got hers when I did & loves it-she's had no problem with it.
1,Motorola Blue Tooth,Had it for a month and now it doesnt work. This is the second one that doesnt work! Dont even know where to return it.
1,Terrible product.,This is a terrible product. You cannot talk on it if you want to be heard not sounding like the teacher from Charlie Brown...or Darth Vadar himself. My sister refuses to speak if I try to use it durning our call. If you want something that works you will have to spend the money.
1,Horrible Headset,"I purchased this headset for my mom's Sanyo phone. Not sure what the problem was, but this headset was completely horrible. Not only was the set up difficult, but the quality was the worst ever. It sounded like you were talking on a cordless phone from the 80's. There was a constant buzzing in the earpiece - which the other caller also heard. I returned this item to amazon and do not recommend it."
1,Awful,"I read the other reviews and ordered this bluetooth. Audio was good on my end, horrible static and low volume on the other end. Could have been a damaged or used unit, but I was lead to believe I was buying a new item. I missed the 15 day deadline to return it. Oops."
1,Pink Bluetoolth Defective,"I had this same item in black that I bought at Verizon Wireless and it has worked wonderfully for 2 yrs. so I ordered online at Amazon in pink for my sister and had to return it twice. The first time it wasn't responding to commands and then didn't work at all. The second time we got one, it buzzed so loud when connected, you couldn't hear the person. My sister had called Motorola directly the second time and they said it was defective and to send it back. I've sent it back and Amazon said they are looking into the problem because it is a ""widespread problem"". In the meantime, I am still waiting for a refund! It has been an extremely frustrating experience and not due to Amazon as they have been good at getting back to me."
2,"Heavy, too tight, and loses the connection..","I could not keep this on for very long. It was very tight and hurt my ear from the front and over the ear. It was also quite heavier than one I had like this before. You can't get more than 15 ft away from the phone, or you will lose the connection. I wouldn't recommend."
1,Broken,"Arrived non-functional. Called Motorola who offered to exchange it but they never followed through on sending me return packaging. I ended up needing to resolve the issue through the distributor, who clearly wasn't responsible for it not working."
3,Headset,"I ordered this headset,as of 7-1-08, the law requires it...............was much cheaper on line than going to the local cell phone store......the only problem i have with this is i can only wear it on my right ear.after several hours it becomes sore and i need to remove it.other than that i enjoy it.Susan"
3,Good little headset for the price,"Bought this as a surprise for my girlfriend, she used my Motorola H800 slider headset & commented how it would be nice to have one so she could talk & not have the hold the phone. She loves it & it does everything she needs it to do & I saved about $20-$25 off store prices so it was great for both of us. If you or your girfriend/wife are looking for an inexpensive bluetooth headset go with this one, good little headset at a good price."
1,Did not work,"Upon opening the package, the item did not work. Sent it to Motorola as part of warranty repairs and got back a different model !!"
2,Original ECHO Can U hear me now?,"I purchased this headset with my new Verizon phone. It was so neat; I wanted to use it all the time. Yet, everytime I used it, the person on the other line complained their voice was echoing (both land and wireless). I thought that the initial complaints I was receiving were just conincidence and that I probably just needed to sync the devices again. I tried to fix it, but eventually out of desparation, I purchased another Motorola (see review ECHO Can U hear me now?) headset with the same results. I would not purchase this headset for use with Verizon LG 9800."
1,Great Value!,I previously had lost the identical bluetooth and paid 3 times more for it. It works great. Easy to use and program into your phone. Simple is good!
5,love it,"I love this headset. It is easy to use, voice clarity is good and it has been great to have it as i commute alot. Only thing i would mention is that it can be a bit confusing to learn to use all the features such as picking up a second incomming call without dropping the first."
2,Bad Reception,I just got this and I have horriable static. Everyone says that I sound like I am far away and that there is a candy wrapper stuck in the phone line. I am not satisfied at all.
3,"Light, but Noisey","The weight is nice and balance on the year is good. The features are good, but one must remember certain button combinations for extended features (like press two buttons at the same time to mute the microphone). The battery life is good. A significant issue is that it picks up surrounding noise better than the person's voice who is taking, which means that it often can't be used. If you don't drive a very quiet car, like a BMW or Mercedes, then users may complain that they can't hear you and ask you to ""pick up the phone."""
4,Better than my old Plantronics,"This bluetooth is much more comfortable resting on the ear. Easy to make calls and receive calls. Volume buttons allow for a lot of leeway in the setting. Still working on getting the voice dial to work without disconnecting the call, but I kept the short information sheet provided with it. (I am sure it is the operator and not the unit itself). I am very pleased with my purchase. It has a longer talk time than my previous BT, much more comfortable and paired easily with my LG phone. And, I love the pink color!"
2,Truly an unsatisfactory headset for me...!,"I think Motorola made a terrible mistake about this headset. The receiving quality is not bad, but the internal microphone really sucks!! When I use this headset, people on the other side always complain that my voice is so small and muffled that they can hardly hear me. The only thing I like about this headset is its design which has nothing to do with the call quality. If you prefer to annoy others with your voice, this will be the one for you. Otherwise, go Plantronics or Logitech!!"
4,Clear easy to use,"I bought this for my wife for christmas. She likes it a lot, she says it is easy to use, is clear even with th car radio on."
4,Very useful device,"This was very easy to set up with my blackberry. I can turn it on and use the voice dialing just by touching the main button on the device. It's hard to tell when it needs to be charged, but I just plug it in overnight about once a week. The headset only has the one button and the side buttons are for volume, so you can't accidentally press a wrong button when you are operating it.The range is fine for when you are using it in the car or my phone is in my purse and I'm carrying it. It gets a little static when I have my phone laying on the kitchen counter and I am walking around doing stuff in the kitchen, but that is to be expected I think.I bought this because it is the one Kimberly Caldwell had in Wrong Turn 2 when she got cut in half by the mutant hillbillies. Lol."
2,Get what u pay for,"For the price, it's ok, but the sound is not very clear & if driving I sometimes lose the connection for a couple of seconds. I know that it is not Verizon, because my last bluetooth did not do that."
3,Nice ear piece,"Motorola 89036J H500 Bluetooth Wireless Headset (Soft Pink)This isn't a bad ear piece if you have hair down to your chin you don't even see it. The controls are alittle cumbersome, and it seems to need charging all the time. All in all it's not a bad little ear piece. I only use it in stores because I can't hear my phone ring. I like the fact that it's bluetooth & my Voyager recognized it right away."
4,Good value,Good value for the price. LOVE the fact that it uses the same charger as my V3 Razr ^_^I'm not lovin' the fact that it changes my ringtones though to this annoying sound :(
1,Motorola H500 Bluetooth,Its just OKThe charge only last for about 2 hours.I would not recomend this product.
1,This Bluetooth makes me blue!,This Bluetooth device is not very good. There is a lot of static and very hard to hear the person you are talking to.
4,Good value,"I like this bluetooth headset. It is a bit heavy and the headset does not stay in your ear, it dangles. You can use it in your left or right ear. The audio is pretty clear but, people can barely hear me when there is wind and other noises so, the noise cancellation is not that good."
5,Great Headset!,This headset is great! I enjoy not having to hold my phone while driving anymore. I used to have a wired headset quite awhile back and remember how uncomfortable it was to have those gel pieces in my ear. I definately recommend this cute device. It goes well with my pink phone. My husband bought a blue one many months ago and paid about $15.00 more at a popular store. He really likes his as well.
2,Beware the description of this book,"This is a supplement to my earlier review. Note that the description of American Insects, by Arnett,... is based on the first edition, in which ""Every order, family, and genus is conveniently numbered and indexed"" and you could ""quickly determine the taxonomic position of any species, genus, or higher taxon of insect known to occur in America and Canada."" This is not the case in the second edition. You can look up major genera only.Subfamilies are listed under an entry for the family, not under the subfamily name, which means you _can't_ quickly determine their taxonomic positions. You have to know the taxonomic position in order to look up the subfamilies. This defeats one major purpose of the book, and renders it not very usable.Whoever provided the text for the book description apparently just carried it over from the previous edition, without taking into account the changes in the new edition. This isn't by a long stretch the same book."
5,Gary's Wish List,"This is a can't put down easy to read book.The story is a wonderful tribute to a son who battles cancer with humor and courage and a family that faces every emotion in trying to cope. It is a heartwarming story. One I will read again! I recommend it for cancer patients, families and friends, as well as others. It will touch your heart! The author has written an excellent book from her heart. Thanks!"
2,not near as strong as the company reports,"the first time I leaned back on it, the thing bent. Once you get to looking at it you see it's not as strong as the manufacturer reports."
3,"Pretty good, very solid and comfortable.","Good solid seats, but only work on certain bleachers. Problem on most indoor gyms. Has a clip that is screwed on the bottom to help hold it in place. Took it off and they are just fine. Little bulky for some."
4,Not much heat in this fire,"Great Falls, Montana, is surrounded by numerous forest fires. Joe's father (Joe is the boy narrator of the story) has lost his job as a golf pro and has gone off to fight the fires. While he's away, Joe's mother falls in love with another man. This is the most Hemingway-ish of Ford's books, and the writing is crisp and clear. But there is also a certain coldness and distance from emotions displayed in the prose that's hard to understand. Ford is one of my favorite writers on the contemporary scene, so I like just about everything he's written so far; this book is good but not as good as ""The Sportswriter"" or ""Independence Day."""
1,Mundane,"I am a well-read student who was assigned this book to assess the family structure of the characters. I was so upset with this book I almost didn't write the paper. A horrible novel about about a boy listening to his parents incessant whining during thier own mid-life crisises. With unbelievable actions and dialogue, and no redeming aspects. Do yourself a favor and dont read this, I lost two hours of my life that I can never get back."
1,Fire Fighting ???,"This has to be the poorest of Ford's work that I have read. Whereas he displays his great talent of elucidating and teasing out human emotions and frailties , the story is ruined by the persistent vein of the main character fighting a forest fire. This I found extremely grating and distracting. Read ""The sportswriter"" and ""Men with Women"" (I have yet to read Independance Day) but skip this one."
4,Things Fall Apart,"Summer 1960, and forest fires rage around Great Falls. When Joe's father is unfairly sacked from his golf job,he volunteers to fight the fires on the mountains whilst the fires engulfing his own life go out of control.Joe's mother falls in love with Warren Miller and Joe has to watch as his family falls apart and lives change forever....Joe is the 16 year old narrator in Ford's exploration of love and change; of how trying to keep hold of what we have or had in the past in a constantly changing world makes us lose sight of the future and meeting its challenges.Ford borrows heavily from Hemingway's literary style (including Hemingway's trait of refering to characters by their full name; here Warren Miller and Clarence Snow to Hemingway's-eg-Robert Jordan or Harry Morgan!)but Ford backs this up with great story telling.I think it was in 'The Sportswriter' that Frank Bascombe says;'I wish I could write like Saul Bellow.' Many would be happy to write like Richard Ford."
1,Misleading title - No description,Be wary of ordering anything without a description.I purchased this thinking 'DELL AXIM' would work with MY 'DELL AXIM X30' and it does not.
4,The New Swiss Family Robinson,"My family and I watched this movie aboard the charter sailing ketch the movie was filmed on ""Erin Go Bragh III"" while cruising the Spanish Virgin Islands in the Caribbean. It provided good entertainment for our kids and inspired them to learn and get more involved in the life-style of sailors at sea. Jane Seymore is great in any movie."
4,Awsome 4 all ages,This movie is awsome for all ages. We watched at a family reunion while it was raining. People from ages 5-70 can enjoy this wonderful film. As soon as we watched it we knew we had to buy it. And if your into classics being modernized than this will be a great selection 4U. Thanx
5,The New Swiss Family Robinson,"I LOVE this movie. It has action, it has romance, and it is totally appropriate. I think its great!"
3,two thumbs up? i think NO,"this is not the best movie in the world. the plotline seems to have absolutely no point worth looking into let alone interesting. i found the character development poor, but the acting fair. that's why i give it three stars, not one like i'd normally put. the movie from the 50's or whenever it was made is much better. there it's actually convincing concerning the pirates because, hey that was the 18th century. but we're in the twentieth in this new make and it does not fit in very well. this is more of a very young child's movie. the violence is phony, and when the older boy gets shot directly above what seems to be the heart, at first he is weak and everything. then he's suddenly standing, looking as though he's just wearing a bloodied shirt. it's horridly phony."
2,Disappointed,"The movie itself would have probably been exciting enough for our family to enjoy. But as an avid user of the tv guardian, this movie did not have closed caption in it and was therefore unviewable by this family. The language was not acceptable. Stick with the older version of this movie if you are a tv guardian user."
2,Disappointed,Color faded dramatically and stained the inside or my dryer blue. Itfinally came off after about 3 weeks. Sheets stiff
1,Terrible,This valance was such a terrible purchase. The color faded within two weeks. And when I washed them most of the blue disaapeared and one of them fell apart. I was very dissapoined in these.
1,Totally boring waste of money and time,If you want to see 3 hrs of some old geyser preaching to a stadium full of people about what he thinks happened on 9/11 then this is for you. No footage at all about what happened.If you have trouble sleeping watch this as you will surely fall to sleep within the first 10 minutes!!!Lame as can be!!
1,Tripe!,"I havn't seen it, but I am sick of these idiotic theories. I can't stand the over inflated government, which I wish would stop socializing and taking over every aspect of my life, but to believe that the government would allow terrorists to fly planes into the towers and then blow the buldings up killing thousands of people is so unbelieveable I can't believe people are that supid. If they were going to use the weapons of mass destructuion argument why would they kill; all those people and not use that as the main argument to invade Iraq? There is just so much wrong with this argument, especially when you check out the special on History Channel done by Popular Mechnics, which destroys all these stupid arguments; and last time I checked Popular Mechanics wasn't run or funded by the government. Stop detroying the memory and name of all the dead and living heroes, by spreading your garbage."
2,alternator,"I'm not sure about the overall quality, in the entire writeup nothing was said about it being made overseas. If I knew that I would've spent the extra money and went with a Motorcraft instead. The writeup was misleading. I guess time will tell but very skeptical."
1,Did not do the job,I found this formula incapable of dealing with a little body oil from fingerprints well. It also seemed to leave a film on the surface of the lens. I do not recommend this.
2,"If you want to learn something, get another book.",".Some books give lots of facts and dates, others concentrate on opinion and discussion. This one does neither: little factual information, plenty of opinion, but leaning over backwards so far to avoid being controversial that you won't learn much.Also bear in mind that this book is not designed to be read; it's a class book with ""thought provoking"" questions at the end of each chapter of the type ""What do you think of....?"". Another way for the author to stay non-committal.Finally, it's expensive."
4,Good buy,"This is a pretty goood book to buy considering the single volume and the amterial offered. However, the organization is a little tricky to grasp and a little chaotic"
4,World Civilizations - The Global Experience,"Book arrived in perfect condition. It was a few days late, but that could have been because of the delays caused with the hurricane on the East Coast."
2,"Long, wordy, disorganized book","Having used this book, I can say that while it is a textbook and has information, it is lengthy and disorganized. They de-emphasize certain things too much and put too much pressure on others, especially specific topics. There are some ""in depth"" sections that are helpful, but I found that they would bring up the same event in little pieces and really does NOT serve its purpose as a world history course. Focusing too much on the details, this book has no system of organization and does not provide a global scale or give any sort of sense of world history.In closing, I do not recommend this book. I have had many frustrations with the writing style, immense detail, and lack of clarity. There are other, more organized, more accurate books out there for AP World History."
2,Poor Choice of Text Book,It is really hard to figure out what the author is talking about or where he is going. It is not hard to communicate hard issues or history in easy to understand language. If you are a Professor or Teacher I would suggest you find a better resource for your class.
4,Great design,"I am a frequent traveler and generally pack real oatmeal for my stays in hotels. The Orikaso solo set is perfect due to the fact that it takes minimal space in the carry on and when folded into shape, it is a substantial vessel. The first time construction is a little challenging, and I am hoping they maintain their durability after repeated folding and unfolding. They are another great gadget for road warriors!"
3,Diverting But Don't See All At Once,"Like a lot of serials, it doesn't feel quite right if you watch it all at once. And hilariously enough, our Brave Coast Guard Officer survives some cliffhangers by just being unkillable! The producer was obviously quite fond of their large freighter model, and of the set of a ship's forward deck -- they show up a lot, with minimal re-dressing.Still, lots of action, and several interesting locations."
3,Ver y slow due to heavy facts yet compensates at the end,The book speaks of the continuing problems with immgration due to border policies between America and Mexico. Out of about 9 chapters eight are facts and figures charts and graphs and only the last chapter is thought provoking. In it the authors give their opinion of how America's border policies should change in order to accomodate Mexican immigrants- they made good points that leaves you somewhat satisfied after a mind numbing 8 chapters of...???? But For research purposes and stats I would definately recommend this book.
2,see and learn,"I was very disappointed with this movie... it is dated lately, but it is drawings that flip from scene to scene... we though there was going to be animation and moving animals and there wasn't it looks like it was made many years ago... definitely disappointed"
5,Gorgeous,It was fun adding these lovely candles to my collection of Christmas candles. Received many compliments because they are very pretty - love their shape and sparkle!
2,christmas candles,Base of candles too big to fit in ANY of the many candle holders we have. And i bought several pairs to give as gifts - Bummer
1,Never got it working,I contacted the tech support and after a little effort they said that it needed to be configured and that they didn't want to take the time to do it! So I never got it working and had to return it. No good.
4,Nice Intermediate Method to Korean Hancha,"I give this book 4 stars because it is easy to follow. This books contains pictures that help you memorize chinese characters, which is called hanch in Korean. It gives the meaning in Korean and English. The author gives examples under hancha on each page. The author, being religious, also include scriptures from the bible in hancha and translates them in English. Its a great tool in learning hancha for Korean speakers and advanced to intermediary students of the Korean language. I don't recommend this book for beginners in the language.This book is great as a guide to learning and memorizing hanch but will not help in actually learning the language. I would say this is more of a supplement."
4,Scanner great but problems exist in 120 scans,"I have used this with my Mac G5 desktop and Photoshop for many scans of negatives and positives. Because I had problems scanning 120 black and white with the 120 holder (it would only preview two at a time instead of six) I was on the phone to Canon for an hour or so. I thought we had it fixed, but it went back to the old habits. Finally, I found that there is a little button at the top left of the scanning screen that you click and I was able to turn off the template and scan whatever was in the 120 holder, cropping the negatives with the drawing tool or drawing around them with that tool so that the software would recognize the negatives that it did not see. To deselect, you click on the negative and hit the delete button. After that, I was able to scan some 400 BW negatives of 120 size without problems. In my estimation, the manual can be improved and the software needs to be rewritten to help the user. Quality of scans was excellent."
4,photoego,"This scanner scans at great quality and is easy to use. So far I have used it as a copier, slide scanner and a film scanner.The film scanner sure makes nice prints. I had used a HP3C scanner to scan prints and the quality is very noticable with the canon giving much better results.I find it very slow as a copier and scanner. The HP3C was much faster. It was connected to the computer thru a SCSI interface which might make the difference.I'm very satisfied with the scanner overall."
1,Canon Can't get their marketing together,"Product is unavailable and was listed anyway. Waited over a month to arrive and then gave up. There is no replace, what are they thinking. Buy something else from another supplier.Amazon was exceptional with their support, got me a refund from the outside vendor immediately when asked."
2,Not worth the price,I just bought my scanner 3 years ago and it has slowed down substantially. It worked great the 1st year. It just doesn't have longevity. I would have bought a cheaper one if I knew I would have to buy a new one every 3 years.
5,What is Next From Canon,"This unit will blow you away. You would think Amazon screwed up and shipped you a Higher priced item. Very easy to use. It is very easy to look at with the sleek hi-tech design. The Software that came with it is easy enough to figure out and use if you never used a scanner, you'll be using it within the hour. Make copies. Use it for Ebay or Amazon to sell your stuff, with a very high resolution. Also I can save all my treasured pictures to disc w/o having to worry about them being stored in some box somewhere getting destroyed or misplaced. I can just burn them to discs. I must mention about a Camcorder I just purchased. It is a Sony DCR-DVD 505 for that trip to 50TH Annual Running at Daytona. ""The Daytona 500""Along with camcorder, the zoom and wide angle lens, case, and the remote tripod. I Highly recommend all these items. With Price and Free Shipping you can't beat it.."
1,Platitudes and Memes,"This book just repeated a bunch of platitudes and Memes that you hear everyday. Divided the world into two groups: ""Great People"" and ""Losers."""
2,Not what I expected,"I have used sea-breeze products in the past and have always been very pleased with them, this 1 umm, not so much, the product even though doesn't seem it can go bad (like spoil) that is what it smells like to me, after using the pad i have to wash with a soap to get the sea-breeze smell off me. it does seem to clean as well as the other types I have used I just find the smell to be offensive, maybe during shipping it may have gotten to hot or something."
4,Good knives,"Bought these knives for my wife and she says the larger knife she would rate a 5 and the little knife she would rate a 3, hence the 4-star rating. The larger knife seems to hold an edge longer than the smaller blade, but that's probably due to the different usage of each knife. Have been careful to wash/dry after each use, so no rust yet. Overall, very happy with the purchase."
2,Not Even Barbecue,"Knowing that she wrote the introduction to Myron Mixon's excellent ""Smokin'"" cookbook, we were excited to watch this dvd and pick up some Southern barbecue tips. I've seen Paula Deen's show on Food network before, and I don't love or hate her (she's fine, I like some of her recipes). The DVD starts with Paula going to a friend's house to check out his pit.. awesome, the pit looked great and they were making a few racks or ribs and some butts. She spends about 5 minutes at the pit, and then says ""we can make something even better inside!"". Wait what? This is supposed to be about barbecue, you can't make that inside. The next recipe on the menu was a soup and then we gave up. It's good if you like Paula Deen, but this ain't barbecue!"
4,Keeps my coffee hot for hours,"I purchased this lid as a replacement for the one that came with my coffee maker after I dropped and cracked it. Together with the insulated carafe it keeps my coffee hot for hours- I can brew the coffee in the AM and have a warm cup in the PM after lunch! My only complaint is that the lid must be unscrewed in order to pour the coffee (vs. a pop up button on similar products from Cuisinart, for example) and that the lid is difficult to unscrew sometimes. You would definitely have difficulty with this lid if you have a weak grip or arthritis.5 stars for keeping my coffee warm.3 stars for non-ergonomic design."
5,A 'must have' reference for any ecologist.,An essential compendium of the ecological theory and its quantitative foundations very well explained and clearly wrote. A 'must have' reference for any ecologist.
5,Cute story...,"If you like the Clifford books, you'll enjoy this one. It's a great Father's Day gift too. My sons curled up with dad after he opened it and he read it to them right on the spot. Very sweet. It sparks conversation too, since Clifford's dad is a regular-sized dog and he isn't red. Enjoy!"
3,Flash Gordon - Super Hero,"I remember seeing these Flash Gordon movies when I was a kid, and was enthralled by the serials (as they were presented). Each week, the show would end with Flash, Dr. Zarkof or Dale Arden in an inescapable death situation.... the next week, we'd see how they escaped. The heros travel to Mars or Mongo to save the earth from the most wicked villan in the universe, Ming the Merciless, played by Charles Middelton. Middelton was superb as Ming.... pure evil. The special effects in the movie are outdated and laughable by today's standards, but were very impressive when they were created. You certainly won't see Star Wars or Return of the Jedi here, but if you want to go back to a much earlier vintage space movie, or if you remember these from your youth, they'll be of value to you."
1,Dead blog,"On the first day of the trial I got an article dated 1/21/2009 in which the blogger says he is going to stop blogging. He obviously did, because the blog hasn't been updated since then."
2,Not the orignal recordings,"Great vocals, but they could have at least changed the speed of the metronome. The tempo of every song sounds the same and gets monotonous after a while.If you're looking for the original recordings you shouldn't buy this CD."
1,Not the original recordings/artists,"If this is just one of the original group members, I would be surprised.These are completely different arrangements, ochestration etc. I believe these selections were recorded simultaneously rather than at different times. They tried to capture the original feel, however, have come up quite short. Get the original recordings, the soul of those great songs are not here!"
1,deception!,"psychedelic and funky?, funky, re-mix, rocked up samba?. The people write this, don't listened the cd. Rica Amabis is a middling average dj punisher the good taste of bossa and samba.stunning, dazzling... bad taste."
3,Pretty good,"If you know VB, it will help. The author explains the flowery stuff in detail, but dances over what I considered to be the meat of Excel VBA. Don't expect to finish the book and think you can code in Excel."
4,Great beginners book,"I already had a modicum of experience using Excel and needing something to make the jump from simple user to power user. I also had experience with VB5 and wanted an introduction to Excel objects. The teaching method is excellent, at first, encouraging me to record a macro and look at the code. From there I recorded complex macros and amended the code to suit my requirements. After a very short period of time the macro record button became redundant and I was fully into writing VBA and using the VBA on-line help, and object browser. This book does what it professes! Step by Step. My complaints are that the on-line CD contained only 1.6Mb of data, and they could have a few more example spreadsheets and forms. There was little or no explanation of variable behaviour which tripped me up when using forms. All in all a worthwhile investment."
1,Confusing Lack of Explanation!,"The first two chapters of the book are informative and enjoyable, however, once certain programming concepts come into play (objects, properties, methods, etc.) there is an inexplicable lack of definition and explanation! The teaching style is driven by example, with no break (even for a few pages) to explain the dynamics of these key concepts in plain english. Any reader new to VBA or OOL (such as myself) will find him/herself left in the dark once they hit chapter three. I can only assume that a certain level of basic OOL understanding is expected, but we are never warned of this... until now!"
4,Excel 97 Book,"Have not used, but is not your fault! I purchased to prepare a course for staff of my company, but I have been too busy."
3,Good to get you started,"This book will introduce you to VB, don't but expect it to make a VB guru out of you. There is enough information to help you get confortable with VB and give you some ideas what to do with it. With that said this book will get you by, depending on what your goals are..."
2,not bad but would look else for vba titles,"very basic coverage not for someone looking, to have the answers spelt/out for you especially if your just begining to learning a programic language like vba, for the first time an average read anyway."
5,Excellent instruction in both VB & Excel!,I read this book knowing nothing about Visual Basic. I was fairly comfortable with Excel. This book does a fair job of teaching Excel as you are learning VB. The content was a little hard to follow at first. I highly recommend sticking with it and then re-reading it. I am nearly finished re-reading it and I have already written some pretty impressive code. My productivity at work will benefit greatly from this book.
3,Not enough VBA.,"This book is OK. I am sad to say that it is the only book I could find that comes close to helping a user code VBA under Excel 97. What I am looking for is a Developers Manual (Like Access 97 Developer's Handbook, published by Sybex). This is the closest I could find, but it lacks enough indepth information for the Excel 97 developer."
2,Wouldn't recommend for beginners in Visual Basic,"Though I am new to Excel and VB, I have several years of experience in spreadsheet automation with another spreadsheet product and macro language. This book certainly provides a wealth of information but it is my opinion that the text is difficult to follow by those inexperienced in visual basic. As a VB beginner, I wouldn't recommend this book unless you have a lot of time to dedicate to your learning experience. Lessons 1 and 2 started off on the right track and were easy to understand. Unfortunately, I felt that the lessons that followed jumped into VB too fast and furious. Explanations such as ""If you assign a range object to a variable, you can use that variable as an object to the range property"" were common and did not provide me with a clear understanding of the issue. Good book for experienced and/or advanced users. In my opinion, beginners should stay away and opt for a more introductory text. Thank you."
4,A very good introduction to using Visual Basic with MS Excel,"Most books aiming to teach programming techniques are awful. This book is an exception. Its strength is that you can learn a lot, and there's nothing left unexplained that can confuse the reader. The only disadvantage of presenting everything in examples is that the book probably suffers as a reference (though I haven't gotten to that stage yet). Also, it's a little on the rudimentary side by my standards. Overall, though, a very pleasant surprise; a software text that explains everything and does nothing to confuse the reader."
2,A different approach that didn't work for me.,"This is a hand-holding book that teaches by example without explaining sufficiently the nuts and bolts of the VBA language. I was not able to make much use of it. In addition, it does not comprehensively cover VBA for Excel. I can appreciate that some readers might prefer the approach taken by this book however."
5,Definitive work On Sex Offenders,"This book is extremely comprehensive and well-written. It covers the broad range of topics related to the field of Sexual Offenders and does so in an informative,clear and user-friendly manner. The book is very practical in orientation and will be invaluable to practitioners struggling to keep abreast of developments in this field. This book also provides an excellent review of the research literature which should prove invaluable to academics, researchers and students interested in this area. Rudy Flora has put together a well-organized volume,which covers the field very comprehensively. This will undoubtedly be considered a definitive handbook in working with Sexual Offenders. As a practicing clinical psychologist, I would recommend it without reservation."
4,"Good, but not one of her best series.","I love McCaffrey's books, but this series is not my favorite. It is good, though."
2,Let it die already,"While I loved the first Acorna books, and fell in love with the sweet little unicorn girl, I quickly changed my mind after this book. The plot was alright, but it seemed to me that McCaffery was rushing through this. She didn't take the time to develop the setting, plot of chars as she should have. She left the ending ambiguous, and tortured a poor creature who had already been tortured enough. Either she needs to spend a lot more time on her writing, or she needs to leave this series alone."
2,Far below her usual efforts,"I have been a fan of Anne McCaffrey for years, but this book seemed far below her usual standards. Aside from being rather boring and plotless, it also seemed rather childish. The plot just seemed to stumble along with no sense of direction. Throwing in silly inconsistencies, like hair changing color because you hopped a space craft did not help."
1,!!,"I hated this book. The plot just didn't bring me in, I realy liked the idea but it just wasn't realy a good book. I have other books by Ann MiCafrey (I highly recomend Dragondrums) and I realy liked most of them, but I found this one to be a let down."
1,wish there was 0 star mark,"Disgustingly silly. Seems that her books are getting more and more ridicilous. Book is full of complete nonsense, characters are [unrealistic],the whole thing is extremely childish. Of course, you'll have a holywood style happy ending. Blech.And she should definitely go back to school to learn some physics and might want to use common sense. Aerosol torpedoes in space?"
4,Great Customer Service,"Beautiful set of lamps!!!Look great at our living room!!I did not expect such good customer service!!!My lamps arrived broken, but immediately after I emailed the seller, I was contacted and advised a brand new set will be shipped out to me. Great customer service!!will definitely continue to purchase from this seller!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I've been making cookies with a press for years and decide to replace my old press with this one about two years ago. I didn't like the way this press worked at all, neither did my daughter. Many times we had the dough lift off the sheet when lifting up the press, very frustrating. Needless to say, we threw this one out after the holidays last year and we're in search of a different one this year."
1,DO NOT BUY,This was the worst cookie press I have ever used. I thought sunbeam made a good product but this must have missed the inspection. Its a glorified caulking gun but I think the caulking gun would work better. This flimsy product contantly got stuck and quite often would pull the whole cookie up with it. Please save yourself the frustration and spend the money on something else.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,I bought this press last Christmas and it broke after 3 uses. The teeth all bent and would no longer click through. Total piece of crap.
3,Not bad for the price,"The press arrived just in time for the holiday and worked pretty well. The cookies turned out fine, and cleaning the press was easy. The only knock is that the trigger mechanism is inconsistent when making large batches of press cookies. Sometimes it clicks at just the right amount of dough, and other times it puts out too much.Given the price, this is a good buy for once-a-year cookie bakers."
1,DO N-O-T BUY THIS EVEN @$4.99,"The title says it all. This is probably the worst kitchen tool ever made. The thing broke during its first use. It simply feels like a tinker. The serrated teeth easily bend. The spring action does not work afterwords. If you unscrew the top assembly, spring just falls off and there is no easy way to reassemble. I should have noticed the brand name."
3,"Good for the price, I guess.","This was my first cookie press I ever bought. Happy with the price, you get what you pay for though. Worked great for animal cookies and peanut butter but some of them stuck to the press. Small kids enjoyed it. After several, about a years worth of use it broke. Still can use it but it sticks & some times wont 'shoot'. Now in search for another one because this one has got me hooked, only if it didn't break."
2,broke on second use,"We used this twice for making spritzes, and on the second batch the plastic cap on the end of the plunger (which pushes the dough out) developed a large crack in it. This resulted in most of the cookie dough squirting up into the chamber (where it's not supposed to be) and we had to quit. Granted, we didn't pay a lot for it, but I had hoped for better quality from Sunbeam."
2,More disposable kitchen ware,"Worked great for one year, then broke. Plunger won't work anymore. Wish there was a better one...."
1,Ruined my Christmas!,"This is an extremely bad cookie press. There were lots of nice attachments, however I didn't get any cookies!!! The dough stuck with EVERY disk. I had to lay down and do deep breathing in order not to totally freak out! You get what you pay for!"
2,Switching Power Supplies A-Z,"I bought this book since it had such high reviews. I was dissapointed when I read the book. Way too much time was spent on very simple topics while other more complicated topics were too simplisitc. Too much emphisis was put on the ""current ripple ratio"". There are many more important things that determine an inductors value. The book states A-Z but there were so many topics not covered. Many people reviewing this book stated ""this was the only power supply book you need, throw all the rest of your power supply books away""??? I wonder if these were written by his friends. If you want a single power supply book I would recommend Abraham Pressman's books. They are much much better! A-Z does have a decent EMI section."
1,Very dissapointing,The high reviews on this book is totally unfounded. The book is down right disappointing. Too much emphasis on topics like ripple ratio and inductors. It's a never ending story and does not bring you to the point you want to get to start a practical design. There are definitely better books on the subject.
3,A mixed bag,"There are lots of good things about this book - EMI chapters, chapter on practical issues and good reference equations all in one place. So from that perspective this is definitely a A-Z book. Also there are some good intution aspects well explained here.Unfortunately i also felt the author talked too much about ripple etc. and made some of the simpler concepts more arcane (for example the introductory chapters on inductors and capacitors and energy sloshing back and forth)So I am split in my review. I believe each reader should try to borrow it/read it in library first to see if the writting style etc. suits them."
3,Good decent read,"The book goes over the major areas needed to understand the subject. As with all the books on this subject, there is no way he can cover everything. He adds his take on the subjects he presents. The book is approachable and an easy read. Something he presents here that most others don't is some of the 'rule of thumb' approaches to the subject that get you to a design quicker."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This camera is such a waste...normal use even delicate use, will break this camera. I have had an older HP for years that Ive never had an issue with, but for some reason I have needed 2 replacements sent to me, due to internal software issues, the camera freezing, etc. It is way too touchy. Also their customer support is outsourced and I have a hard time getting the people to understand my problems, and they wont repair the camera, just keep sending new ones to me. This is a limited edition item, is it just supposed to sit pretty on the shelf? I never know if they are going to send me the same model since its pretty hard to find now. A waste of time and money."
2,"cute but basic, HORRIBLE for live events!","If you like to take your camera to concerts, this is NOT the camera for you. it won't take the picture if it cannot focus, and it will always let you down if you try to use it for quick, once-in-a-lifetime moments! however, the pics look great for 4.1mp in casual use. i've had several software errors come up during the portrait setting. it still works fine after two years of use. the audio is always static filled, so its useless.some of the pixels on the viewing screen have gone out or something, because they are either red or blue dots on my screen."
2,Expensive for what you get,"These characters don't look a thing like the actual one's in the movie Valor vs. Venom. They can't hold their weapons, it's actually frustrating since these are toys for children to play with not to collect. I wonuldn't even buy this to keep in a collection, they look that bad! They don't look any better than the cheap generic one's you could buy at Wal-Mart for half the price. You're better of buying the single sets or the one's with two or three in them instead."
5,MUY COMPLETO,"ME ENCANTO ! PERO PENSE QUE ERA PARA BEBES, SIN EMBARGO TIENE INFORMACION PARA NINOS A PARTIR DE 3 ANOS. TENGO UN BEBE DE 1 ANO, Y CUANDO EMPIEZO A LEERLE ESTO , SE ABURRE, PUES ES MUY LARGO. DE TODAS MANERAS ME PARECE PERFECTO PARA ENSENARLE A LOS CHICOS ACERCA DE LA LUNA, LA TIERRA, ESTRELLAS, ETC"
1,Xact Communications XHB201,"After viewing the review for this phone, I have changed my mind about ordering it since the one buyer has/had so much trouble simply receiving his order, sounds like fraud to me. The rating of one star is for the phone itself, but i would give the seller a zero rating."
3,nycfs,"I bought this soundtrack for the cool music heard during the suspenseful parts of the film. After sorting it out, I've come to the conclusion that there are only three tracks listeners are really looking for. The three most identiful tracks are #1 Main Title, #7 Ice Pick Mike, and #9 Shifting Gears. These are the three that are the most recognizable. Don't get me wrong, it's worth the cost just to have these three, but the rest of the cd contains the jazzy riffs you hear throughout the movie. Which by themselves aren't necessarily bad, but it's the three I list that are the cream of the soundtrack, and what most people remember from the movie. So get the soundtrack if you love Bullitt, but just cue up those three tracks, you won't be sorry."
4,If you're a Bullitt fan you'll love this CD!,"The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because there were a few songs I didn't really care for. I have been trying to get a copy for a long time just for the cut ""Song For Cathy"", and the music leading up to the car chase,you'll hear the burning of rubber when it finishes! Great CD!"
1,not happy,i was really upset when I got this. As soon as I opened the trashbag it ripped. I taped it and even though i was careful with it. it still kept calling apart
5,Thank you!,I was so excited to see that someone sold theses bags. I looked everywhere for them. Thank you very much
2,Don't buy,"The bags appear to be large since they are as big as a two year old girl in the picture on Amazon. These bags are not big at all. In fact, my 18 month old towers over them. I thought I was buying huge leaf bags, and instead feel pretty cheated after paying $12.00 for two regular size garbage bags."
4,Great portable fishfinder,"I purchased this fishfinder for use on my canoe, and it works well. I am sure there are better portable fishfinders out there but if you want the depth and temperature of water, bottom structure, and occasional fish markings (who knows how accurate they are) for a very reasonable price, this fishfinder is it.Interesting one of the other reviewers mentioned missing parts... My fishfinder was also missing a couple of the ""minor"" parts. I emailed Hummingbird at their website and received the parts within a week. It's the best response for a less than ideal situation."
2,Portable Fish Finder,Product would work great if they shipped all the correct parts for it from the factory. Calling the factory doesn't help they will tell you what you want to hear and then never follow through. The depth finder itself really workds well.
2,wasn't worth it,game wasn't worth buying. It really sucked. I didn't like it at all. gave it to the children to play.
5,crash bandit action pack,"Excellent price,much cheaper than Wal-mart!Came brand new & in perfect condition with super fast shipping!Thanks so much! My little boy's love it!"
3,bundle of wacy,"If your a gamer and hve kids , this is the bundle for you , otherwise stay away .some of the game play is wacy, hard to figure ou and just plain repetitive."
1,no lo he jugado,"mi play 3 no lee estos juegos, no los compren, es perder el dinero, y es una lastima a mi me encantaba crash"
5,soft and durable fabric,"soft and durable fabric, it is not thin fabric as the gerber ones, these are better and niceer."
3,"Great material, poor sizing","While I love the thickness of the material, the sizing leaves something to be desired. I have had the same problems as other reviewers in that the sleeves are more like 3/4-length sleeves on my son (even when buying one size up), and I find the neck to be unusually wide. This is great for getting the bodysuit over baby's head comfortably, but as my son grew the bodysuit started to slide down over his shoulders at the neck.Make sure to purchase this in a size that is at a size larger than what your baby is wearing, and do not count on it reaching your baby's wrists."
2,Wide,These are way too wide for my son. The cotton is soft- but maybe too soft because it doesn't hold it's shape.
2,"Too short, too wide","These are nice, soft onesies, but at least for my baby, the sizing is way off. They are very short and wide. We're not a tall family, and my 3 month old is in the 50% for length, but she's already almost too long for the 6 month size. We had to cut the snaps off the 3 month size and make them into t-shirts. I would recommend another brand, unless you have a particularly short and stout baby."
5,Fabric thicker,The quality is very good. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. I'm very happy with the purchase! I really enjoyed!
3,Neck is too stretchy,"The neck of these stretches too wide. I really wanted to love these and I do love everything else about them. Great material, subtle pink and really cute, thicker cotton than Carters brand. But the neck is just too big and I end up not putting them on my baby."
2,Shoulders are too big,"I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews about the shoulders. The quality of the onesies are very nice and thick, but they keep sliding off my baby's shoulders. Hope he grows into them because they are nice."
2,Runs WAY Small,"Though everyone is right that the shirt is soft and seemingly of nice quality; the sizing is WAY off. I bought these to replace 18mo Carter's brand undershirts that were too small and the 24mo Spasilk size was SMALLER than the 18mo Carter's size! They would have been lovely to use like a year ago, but now they are just a waste of money.... Also the neck is a bit awkwardly big as noted in some of the reviews, though that didn't bother me too too much as they are undershirts."
4,Good quality,"These are good quality bodysuits, a nice solid construction and generous sizing. I was tired of gerber always running super small so I switched to these. They cost more, but their quality is much higher. One star off because they use real tags instead of the printed ones most baby clothes have these days. Try are really long and I am sure will be irritating to baby's sensitive skin :("
3,Tall slim baby...not the product for you.,"First off, I will write what I think is nice. This product is thick and has nice shoulder openings.However, it says for 18 months it will fit up to 27 lbs. My daughter is 20 lbs. I could not even get the onesie over her diaper halfway to snap. The sizing is for round, not long. If you have a chunky short baby, these are probably going to work for you. If you have a tall slim baby, look elsewhere."
5,Perfect bodysuit,I like it so much. It's perfect for my baby for this crazy weather. It's fits too well and the material is too soft.Recommended
1,not good,"My child is 18 months, so I bought 24 months. It was 3/4 sleeves and didn't fit right around the collar area."
2,Stretched,"Originally, I liked the softness of the material. However, after only 2 washes and 1 wear, the neck is so stretched that it no longer fits my daughter. So I had to go purchase more. Very disappointing."
1,Head opening is way huge and very loose. Exposes shoulder.,"The head opening is way huge and very loose. To the point where onsie falls down the shoulder. Waste of money, Used once."
2,Run small - and boat neck is girly,"I bought the 18 month size for my 13 month son. He's average height and weight and outgrew them at 15-16 months. The sleeves were too short from day one. Also, the neckline is a boatneck - which is looks better on girl."
4,Run small,"I bought the 9 month size for my 6 month olds and these will probably only fit for about a month. I love them otherwise, they're soft and hold up well."
3,Super soft but awkward fit,These onsies are made from a great fabric - super soft and thick. However the neck is really large so they don't fit well. They also run a little small. I will possibly buy more for nighttime because the fabric is so comfy.
4,High-quality basics for baby,"I bought these in the 6 month size when my baby was around 3 months, figuring she'd have room to grow. At 5 months they're getting a little tight, but our baby is also really big (around 18 lbs now). If you have a larger baby, definitely buy the next size.I didn't noticed much shrinkage when I washed them, and the cotton is nice and thick, and super soft. After several washings in warm water, they still looked new. They are great for pairing with overalls, pants or jumpers, especially patterned ones.I liked these so much I just purchased the 12-month size, which hopefully we can use for a while. It's a great deal, and they're so much better quality than the Carter's and Gerber brand ones usually sold in department stores."
5,Our favorite onesies,"The best part about these is the quality - we were given one set of Gerbers and in comparison, these are MUCH thicker, softer, and nicer. They've held up to numerous washings and we'll be buying more of these as she grows. My daughter was about 7 months when she started wearing these. We got the 9 month size, so they were a little big, but we just rolled the sleeves and it was fine. She's now almost 11 months and they fit her well - but she's a small kid for her age. So fit-wise, they probably run a little small as other reviewers have mentioned. Love these!"
4,nice soft onesie,"These onesies are made of a nice, soft cotton. They run a bit small: my son wore an 18 month size at 15 months. Also the sleeves are a little short. Otherwise, these are very nice, easy to put on and seem comfortable for him."
5,"Great product, good price.","Was a little hesitant to order these thinking they may not be good quality. So far, these seem great, they should hold up, and they were pretty inexpensive compared to some. Free super saver shipping is great too, if you can wait a little longer to get them."
1,Disappointed,"I read the others reviews and I bought two packages of these bodysuit. They are small for the size in the tag, and after the first wash they totally lose their shape :("
1,Whole chest is exposed - bad design!,"My two-year-old has to wear these backwards because when he wears them the 'right' way, his whole chest is exposed; the design is poor."
2,It would be OK if not the neck!,"The quality of these bodysuits are fine, however the way it fits is really uncomfortable, the neck is very very large and does not properly cover my baby's chest. I have ordered a pack for 3 months old, and even when my baby is 3.5 months I still can't put them on, because it feels like nothing covers my baby's chest!"
3,Long Sleeve Bodysuti,These are very soft so I assume comfortable for my daughter but they seem to shrink. She's pretty little so they still work fine but they are kind of oddly shaped now.
3,"SpaSilk Is ""OK""","These onesies are cute with the pink stitching, but they weren't the softest clothes I've encountered for my daughter. I bought them because of the cooler weather and in that regard they work great. As mentioned in other reviews, the sleeves are a bit short, but not so much that it is unwearable. Also, I bought the 3 month size for my daughter who is 4 months old and 44% in weight and 61% in height (she is usually a bit small for clothes her size). They fit just right, but with only a bit of wiggle room. According to the tag that came with the onesies, the sizing is as follows: Preemie - 5 lbs, NB - 9 lbs, 3 months - 12 lbs, 6 months - 18 lbs, 9 months - 21 lbs, 12 months - 24 lbs, 18 months - 27 lbs, 24 months - 30 lbs."
2,Strange Fit,"I bought the 9 month size and found the fit to be very large around the neck. I was hoping for a onsesie to wear in colder weather to keep the peanut warm, but this onesie will not do the trick due to the amount of skin exposed at the neck.. I also found, like other reviewers that the cut across the legs interferes with the diaper. My baby is big for his age, but proportionate. I have not found any issues with washing. Fabric is OK - thicker than some of the Carter's and of average softness. Personally I do not care for the blue stitching for a boy, but think it would be great for a girl."
3,Necks are too big,"I purchased these to go under jumpers for my toddler girl. the necks come down so low that it almost shows her private areas when properly situated and it does show things off if she is maladjusted (as many toddlers get after play). I purchased it b/c of the long sleeves and the reasonable price, but since these are good for only bedtime at best and she already has night clothes, this was pretty much a waste."
3,Not that well made,"I don't love these. They don't fit well around the shoulder and don't look great. Also, I noticed a whole in one of them today. They're okay. I put them under my baby's pajamas, but wouldn't have him wear them during the day."
3,"Good quality, weird fit","As other reviewers have noted, these bodysuits run very wide at the shoulders. It's great for slipping over the head if your kid has a huge noggin, but means they slide down the shoulders and your child looks like something from an 80's dance movie. They're also short in the torso and high-cut at the leg openings (again, one set of legwarmers shy of Flashdance). But the fabric is very soft and thick, they launder well, and the overall quality is good. I've had trouble finding long-sleeve plain white bodysuits, so did end up getting these in a larger size once my kid grew out of the 3 month ones. One tip - the all white (as opposed to the white with colored stitching) are much cheaper. Guess those pink and blue threads cost a lot."
2,Poorly sized,"I was disappointed in these shirts because there was too much give in the fabric. The neck stretched out and did not reshape after putting it on. Though I ordered the correct size, too much of baby's neck was exposed after putting it on and it looked sloppy and too big,in addition to not keeping baby warm, which was the intent. It reminded me of putting on dirty clothes that were too big. Would definitely not recommend."
3,Soft and warm but size issues,"Soft, white and warm. I bought the 24 month size to go underneath clothes in winter. My daughter is small to average size. The body runs large - the leg openings are very big. But the part that baffles me are the sleeves - they run short! My daughter is not long limbed but the sleeves only go 3/4 of the way down her arms. I had to check the site again to see if they were ""long sleeved"" or 3/4 sleeves! I don't really care - it's just an undergarment for her - but be aware."
3,smaller than expected,These were high quality onesies made with thick soft cotton. But the 18 month sleeve length was closer to a 12 month size. They were too short and I ended up giving them to a friend.
1,Sleeves are too short,"While the fabric is of good quality, the sleeves barely make it past my son's elbows!"
2,The suit is smaller than it should be,I bought one set of this suits with size 24 months. But it's too small compare to other brand. The sleeves are shorter too.
2,great fabric but run too big,"nice feel to fabric but way too big. Unless your kid is a tank, they'll be swimming in these onsies. My son is 20 lbs and 1 yr old and he is swimming in them. Would not but unless I had a fat baby."
5,Excellent quality and soft,"Excellent quality and soft, my baby loves it and wash after wash it hasnt lost anything. Would highly recommend the product"
2,Neck is way too wide,"I thought these onesies were so cute with the pink stitching. The necks are way too wide for our 6 month old. I can't see these fitting any baby properly. The opening ends up slipping off the shoulder, giving her an 80s pop star look. Not a very good look for a baby."
1,Do not wash well,"These are some of the worst onesies I've bought. After just washing and line drying these onesies became very misshapen. The sleeves shrunk, the body shrunk so that it's hard to snap the crotch and the neck stretched out so much that most of her shoulders show. I wouldn't recommend these. The only positive is their thickness."
3,runs very big,"I bought this brand because someone gave me sleeveless onesies in this brand and I LOVED them. The one I bought here run big, and the neck hole gets stretched out as soon as you pull it over the baby's head. The fabric is still nice and thick, but I am disappointed with the way they fit."
5,Great shirts for kids,These shirts are very soft and thick. We have purchased these at each size for our son as he has grown and we have no complaints at all. They are a little bit smaller than other shirts but they are designed to be used as undershirts so they are perfect. We have used the same size in these as we do in regular shirts and find them consistent in sizes.
4,as advertised -- i like it,very easy to put on and take off -- since it is designed specifically for easy on-off wear. soft and comfortable
2,Returned the white one,"Almost all baby clothes I've bought do not have tags behind the neck (carter's, giggle, under the nile, kushies, etc). I bought the spasilk white onesies with blue threading as well as the ones with pink threading, and they do not also. But, the white ones with white threading do! Not sure if it's annoying for the baby, but just odd that this particular style has it. So, I returned it. I've had shirts with scratchy tags I've hated. and since there are so many options w/out tags out there, I didn't want to bother with finding out if it irritates her or not."
4,"Nice quality, but order a size up","These onesies are well made, but as the other reviews mentioned order a size up. My daughter wears 3-6 month so I purchased the 9 month & they fit perfect."
2,Wide through shoulders & short arms,"I bought a 3 pack of these onsies in the 18 month size. My baby is 13 months- he's tall, not skinny, but certainly not chubby- most other 18 month size clothes fit him perfectly. These onsies are very wide through the sholders and because of this the lap shoulder design droops and they don't stay on well around the neck/shoulder area. The arms are also very short, they look like 3/4 sleeves rather then long sleeves. In the picture they looks much longer and narrower then they actually are. The cotton is very soft and the fit might work if your child is short and has a thick, chubby body type, but overall I am disappointed and I'm not sure I will be able to use these."
2,Good but not great,"I bought these to use as undershirts for the cooler weather. The fabric is nice and soft but that is all I really liked. The main issue I've had with these is that it is a tight fit in the length. I bought the 24 month size for my 20 month old and it was hard for me to snap, as if the torso was not long enough. I've not had that problem with other brands of bodysuits as others fit just fine in that area. I also wish the sleeves were a little longer as they go just past my little ones elbows and not down to the wrists. Overall, not a horrible purchase but probably something I will not personally get again."
4,order a size larger,"good quality (nice and thick, good stitching) but size is a little small.Guess I am used to Carter's sizing. I ordered 12 month, and these were a little small for my 1 year old. He's only wearing Carter's 1 year now but these in 1 year are too small. Order a size up."
3,"Nice fabric, poor construction","I purchased these onesies for my sister's baby shower...we did onesie decorating! Anyhow, I sized up as recommended by other reviewers and by doing so ended up with a length nearly equivalent to the Carter's brand. The fabric is wonderfully soft and the onesies were super cute with the blue stitching, but the construction left much to be desired.They fit my nephew perfectly and have had no issues with wash-n-wear type stuff, but the snaps do not line up with the buttons! They are VERY crooked, making one leg hole nearly twice the size of the other! Because they were decorated prior to us noticing this flaw, I have not attempted to contact the seller for a refund or exchange. Very disappointing, though, because they would have been perfect otherwise!"
3,Not a great fit,"These are nice quality onesies and are very soft. But, they just fit a little akward. They are wider and my son is a long baby. So, they ended up hanging off his shoulders and pulling halway down his chest. I don't see these getting much use."
1,Cheap fabric with tags,The onesies seem to be made with very cheap (thin) fabric and have HUGE tags that can scratch the baby's neck. Also the head hole at the top is VERY wide (and seems to stretch out even more when my little one is wearing it) and will hang over the baby's shoulder. The stitching has also come out in a few places on the ones that I have. Quite disappointing.
1,big necks,the neck is big i dont like these!! they streach out and dont go back i would not recommend these!!
2,quality is ok. size is not.,"It's regular white onesie material, and the sleeve length and overall suit length are true to size. HOWEVER, the opening for the head is just HUGE! It won't stay on my baby's shoulders - and I have a larger baby. Also the tags are ridiculously long, I had to cut them off.these onesies may be cheaper than Gerber or Carters, but I will cough up the extra dollars next time."
2,Should have stuck with Gerber...,"Problems:- The neck opening (with overlapping shoulders - pretty standard design element for onesies) is very loose and floppy.- There is a sewn-in tag, instead of a label printed on the inside. I prefer no tag since it could be irritating for the baby.- Sizing is larger than Carters or Little Me 9 months. Label actually indicates 21lbs, which is bigger than my baby."
5,Excellent buy!,These onesies are great! I have other onesies that shrunk horribly when I washed them; the 3-6 month size wasn't any larger than the 0-3 month size. The Spa Silk did shrink a little but are still true to size and really soft! I recommend them.
4,Good quality onesies,"I think these are nice, thick, warm onesies. The only issue I have is the sleeves seem short (like 3/4 length) on my daughter. The body length is fine. She is not a large toddler by any means either. You may want to order one size up for that reason."
3,It's ok.,"The fabric is nice and thick, but the neck hole is on the larger side. The body portion is also wide. I prefer the gerber brand so these always end up on the bottom of our stack."
3,Short sleeves,The quality of the fabric is soft and more substantial than Gerber onesies. My only complaint is that the sleeves are short. I bought the 18 month size for my 12 month old and the sleeves cut off halfway between his wrist and elbow.
2,They Run Small and Sleeves Are Short,Sleeves of those bodysuits are ridiculously small. I bought 24 month size for my 17 month old son and they still are small for him. Fabric quality is good though... I would not recommend buying those.
4,PRE-RUNDMC,"eye opener for all those who think oldskool hiphop only stops at Run-dmc, or the Furious 5, recognize the forefathers who layed down the foundation of the Hip-Hop culture and what they were facing at that time.Book has pretty good historical context and the stories flow together. Much props to mr.Ahearn and mr. Fricke. Only giving it 4stars because I'm still halfway in the book. YES YES Y'ALL."
1,Badly made,Even though item was cheap it is very badly made and came apart as we were putting on the seat of a Dodge Dakota. I sent it back.
2,too fast-paced for me,"It adds to my stress level to try to keep up with Suzanne Deason! The pace of this video is very fast, most poses are only held for one breath. So I found I was spending a lot of effort looking up at the TV, and was not getting the mental grounding effect that I was looking for. I much prefer Patricia Walden's PM Yoga, which has a lot of the same poses but at a more relaxed pace."
5,Best place to start,Suzanne Deason's stress relief is just that...Relief. Out of all the beginners tapes this is the best place to start. Once you relieve your tight muscles and your busy mind there will be a desire to continue the learning process. With the use of props just about anyone can do all of the poses.Suzanne seems to be the Living Arts instructor with the best use of props. So if you are tight this tape is the one for you.
2,Not for beginners,"Although this DVD is marketed to beginners and is included in Gaiam's ""All Day Yoga for Beginners,"" this is NOT a beginner's workout. This 20 minute workout moves quickly from pose to pose, using the Yoga name rather than a descriptivephrase, i.e. ""Begin in mountain pose"" rather than ""begin by standing erect."" forcing the student to constantly refer to the screen.Many of the poses require more balance and flexibility than a beginner possesses and no intermediate or substitute poses are given. Instructor Suzanne Deason's only concession to beginners is the use of a block to lessen the stretch of some of the poses.I would NOT recommend this to a beginner looking for a relaxing routine."
3,Not so beginning,"I don't think this tape is a good beginners tape. The first few poses are easy enough, but I would not call the trianlge pose an easy, relaxing pose at all. Some of the others were also quite difficult - especially considering this is marketed as a relaxation tape. The music and scenery is relaxing, but not most of the poses."
3,Way too fast,"I am a big fan of Rodney Yee and the Living Arts series, which is why I bought this tape. Suzanne Deason moves so fast that I was geting stressed trying to keep up with her. The poses are not held long enough to be effective. This tape was a disapointment in an otherwise wonderful series."
1,not received,"I had an old VHS i was trying to replace. I have not received this itemas of yet. Hopefully I will, it is fabulous beginning yoga"
2,Not for a beginner.......,"Although I find the scenery beautiful and relaxing, I find this yoga tape to be to fast for a beginner, once you get to know the poses you will be able to catch up. I don't recommend this for a beginner."
2,Stress Relief - too Fast,"This is supposed to be a relaxing video; however, the poses move way too fast to get the sense of relaxation. If you are a beginner, this may be too much for you--it was for me. Also, she spends way too much time during the video talking and telling you the name of each pose. I prefer Patricia Walden's PM Yoga. Her voice is much more soothing which I find helps me relax. The poses are not too hard and after several times doing them you will be amazed at the increase in flexibility. After doing Patrica's pm yoga, i was so relaxed i actually fell asleep several times on the floor after doing it. Talk about deep relaxation."
2,Very little relief and not for beginners!,"I am a big fan of the Living Arts yoga series but this is one tape I cannot enjoy. I have been practicing yoga seriously (daily) for seven months now and this tape offered me very little. The poses should be relaxing but she rushes you through the moves way too quickly to feel any release at all. If you are interested in starting yoga, please begin with any of the Linda Arkin tapes! They are much better, longer, offer slower-paced instruction, and will prepare you for the Living Arts series gradually."
2,Stress relief? No way!,"The movements are good in this video and they are great for a beginner, but the speed is unbelievable. It's like they crammed as much as they could into 20 minutes. The poses change so fast. At the beginning, I couldn't believe how fast she goes. The pace slows a little and by the end you are more relaxed, but only still recovering from the fast paced first half. Like I said, the movements are good and a nice program for beginners, but the pace is by no means a good one for stress relief. It should be called Yoga for those in a major rush. This series of videos is outstanding. I have never been disappointed in the past. I recommend looking in this same series, but another video."
1,This tape is TOO FAST to be relaxing!!,"This tape moves too fast for stress relief and relaxation. Forget about proper breathing techniques which really stress me out even more when I try to follow her. I get more relaxation watching TV. Try chi kung, cause I'm definitely looking for something better than this!"
1,Stressful!,"Instructor moves too fast for you to even focus on your breathing. Certainly not a stress reliever, and not for those looking for gentle/restorative yoga."
3,Good and Bad,"We use these in a professional environment, where they run several hours a day. My quick thoughts:1. The weight and balance is good - this is a nice lightweight tool, especially compared to its competitors.2. The dust collection works adequately, far better than its competitors3. Durability has been spotty - we have some that have lasted several years, one only lasted 2 weeks before the brushes overheated and melted into the case.3a. Noisy.4. In this class of sander, there are few choices which are suitable for professional use. Since we do a lot of delicate furniture work, including veneer sanding, we don't want huge heavy sanders. We value good balance, light weight, dust collection, and durablity. It doesn't cut it in all respects, but its better than the other sanders in this size that we have tried."
1,TOTALLY WORTHLESS,"I used these for one (1) dinner with friends, after which, all 5 I bought were rendered useless.The spring that sits in between the handle falls out with great ease, and without this tension being provided, I would have been better off buying kids scissors. Try eating a lobster with kid scissors, and that's exactly the experience these provide.Additional, the red plastic tab, broke off 3 of the 5 units before even using them. So even if the springs lasted (more than one meal), you cannot close the unit for storage. Its so cheaply made, that they practically disintegrate at the dinner table before use.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Nothing special here,"The scissors part cuts well. The major problem with this is that the spring between the two handles falls out all the time when it is open. Once cut, then the spring falls out. Put it back in and one cut and the spring falls out. Don't waste your money on this."
5,Lobster shears,"this is a great tool to have if you are a seafood lover, it works great and easy to use!"
3,Fox Run Brand Lobster Shears,"I bought four pairs of shears. We used 3 of them to cut 140 lobsters in total. The spring on one pair of shears came out(which made using it almost impossible) and the red lock on another one broke off but the shears still did the job. Considering the price, the shears did what we needed. They are not meant for heavy duty, frequent use, but are good value for the price."
3,NOT A KID JUST DIDNT WANT TO SIGN IN,This book is okay. It tells a lot about sneaking and hiding like its an art. Plus you could do almost anything to a guy you snuck up on. I think the most valuable things in it are the chi exercises and stuff. Other than that its not worth the price.
5,This is the book!!,"Sad comentaries about the art being made by the ones that know nothing about ninjitsu (with an ""i"" like in jiu-jitsu). This book is great. Crossing his legs is called Heng Pu, the very foundation of the art!!! Try to use a hook and rope and try to climb with your back to the wall!!!Funny!! A skilled Black Dragon Ninja would have observed the environment before making the climb!! Also, after jumping from the top of the fence, you will land on your feet, wouldn't you. If you read the book ...it's explained that, AFTER landing on the feet, you should roll! Ashida is a skilled Ninja. Mi LU PU is also the very foundation of the art. This Black Dragon is a complete system. In Secrets of the Ninja you are given the basics. This knowledge is to be expanded as you go along. Positions of concealment are ok. Hai Lung is the best ryu!!"
1,ashida kim NOT an authority on ninjutsu,"Anyone interested in ninjutsu, either for training or scholarly studies, should not read this or any of Ashida Kim's books on ninjutsu. I have studied ninjutsu for about six years now, and having read one of his books and spoken to other students on the subject, his books are not based on actual experience with the art, but rather rely heavily on his imagination. If you're interested in the truth about ninjutsu and want to read up on it, spend your money on another author. Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi, the Grandmaster of all nine ninjutsu schools, has written several wonderful and insightful books about it."
1,Ashida Kim is Bad,"1. The book shows no real ninjutsu. Review any of the books related to the Bujinkan if you want to see the real stuff. 2. Worst martial arts I've seen depicted in any book. 3. Ashida Kim won't even put a biography of his experiences with the martial arts in his book. 4. Let's see, Korean and Chinese names for a Japanese art. What's wrong with this picture?"
2,IT's half and half,"Well first of all Ashida Kim OR CHRISTOPHER HUNTER is not completly accurate on ""NINJITSU""(its really ninjutsu) its good if u want to learn techniques fast though BUt I highely recommend stephen hayes, masuuki hatsumi, or charles ITs an ok book"
3,the 80's classic,"this favorite of 13-year-old boys in the 80's is published again -- according to Ashida Kim / Radford Davis's website, however, he has been robbed of most of the royalties from this baby. Too bad his secret ninja skills don't allow him to use mind control on his publishers . . .In truth, though, this isn't one of his more enjoyable titles -- there's a hell of a lot of boring stuff about meditation and Japanese caligraphy to wade through before you get to the fun stuff about cutting throats and sneaking around."
4,Intresting,"Egotistical writing, poor production (copy machiene like), but whats also in 'Ninjutsu: History and Tradition' seems to mostly corrolate with the material in this book. The nine ways of throwing sequence is surly impressive. Basicly, it's a standard 80's ninja book."
3,Good book to read about ninjitsu,This is a very interesting book about ninjitsu that will tell you many things about the subject and what to do in a situation.
3,A good second story.,"Willard Scott, along with Bill Crider, does a wonderful job of giving us that small town feeling. I enjoyed this book immensely (as I did the first one). It is an enjoyable series, and I really liked the idea of a battle reenactment. Willard Scott does an admirable job of modeling Stanley Waters after himself, faults and all. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who would like a nice, light weekend read."
4,Demise of a great series,Am sorry to hear from Bill Crider that this series will not be continued. I really enjoyed both of them.
3,Another Stanley Waters mystery,"Stanley Waters, former weatherman for a popular network morning show, still has a passion for appearing in front of the cameras. He has a new found love, amateur sleuth. In this new novel by NBC TV personality Willard Scott we find bed and breakfast owner Waters in the thick of an investigation, again. When local businessman Rance Wofford is fatally wounded in a Civil War reenactment. Stanley is also wounded; and there's speculation that Stanley might have been the real target and not Wofford.The Higgins, VA folk are in this novel. ""Murder in the Mist,"" as they were in ""Murder Under Blue Skies."" The romantic interests between Stanley and his high school sweetheart, now chief of police, Marilyn Tunney intensifies. Both Stanley Waters mysteries are fun, light reading. Scott wrote both with Bill Crider a highly acclaimed writer of mysteries in his own right."
2,Those interested in reenacting will be disappointed,"The premise of a murder at a reenactment has much potential. Unfortunately, no interesting scenarios or characters exploiting this premise are presented in this book. Nor will you learn anything at all about reenacting or the War Between the States. Neither author could have possibly researched the book by attending an actual reenactment as either a spectator or a participant.While nothing in this book is offensive (the reason I gave it 2 stars), this is extremely light, non-engaging reading. In fact, is seems to be written for young readers rather than adult mystery readers. One author would surely be better than the ""as told to"" collaboration attempted here."
3,First novel for real weatherman good attempt.,"To be honest I read this book because I enjoy Willard Scott on NBC's Today's Show and other endeavors. I found the book entertaining and tried to figure out who done it. It also caught my attention because I too would like to own a B&B somewhere. Perhaps not in Virginia but in upstate New York. All that on the side ""Murder Under Blue Skies,"" was a good read but not what I would call a page turner until near the end when the killer was about to be caught. This was the first Stanley Waters mystery with others to follow."
2,Not for Arachnophobes,"Typically Sideshow/Weta makes amazing statues, and I could argue that this one has great detail. However, it is extremely fragile and parts of it could easily snap off. Secondly, it's not really that cool. It's just a creepy spider with a very small webbed Frodo surrounded by little skulls. Shelob was Tolkien's least-imaginative creature in the books, and not surprisingly, this is the least interesting statue I've seen (though, again, it has great detail). Pass on this and get aLord of the Rings: Battle Troll of Mordor StatueorMoria Orc Premium Format Figureinstead."
1,Overview of LogoMaker,"I just received the software and am throughly disappointed. I had better luck with free online logo design than with mylogomaker. The program is not easy to use, the designs are for the most generic and amateurish. The fonts were hard to get locate and use. Not every graphic would allow you to access the fonts. I would not recommend this software and plan to send it back to the manufacture."
1,WARNING !! WARNING !! DO NOT USE THESE !! WARNING,"WARNING, DO NOT USE THESE EAR BUDS!!! I bought these ear buds 2 months ago, I paid alittle more because I thought I would like the in-ear design. After 2 months of use the Tip of the Right ear bud broke off the end and dropped deep into my ear. I had to go to urgent care to have it removed and I ended up with an inner ear infection. I am on ear drops and I have to take pill form antibiotics. I would ever so highly recomend that you look for inner ear buds that are one piece that is all connected. Do not use these, I paid 15.99 for the ear buds, 120.00 for an urgent care visit, and so far 67.00 in prescriptions trying to get over the infection. Me warning you not to use these, PRICELESS!!!"
3,"Eh, no thanks",They *barely* reduce noise. The left/right wires are different length and that is annoying. They don't fit in my ear very well. The bass is a little heavy but otherwise the sound is alright.
3,Different for different people,"I got these on the recommendation of the technology column in a local paper. In my hands they have NO high end as delivered. Perhaps if you have a large ear canal, you may get some high end. I had to cut off the small nib on the end to get decent highs (I guess my ear canal was closing off the small nib entirely) and now they won't stay in my ears very well, but at least I'm getting decently balanced sound. You can get these things for a fiver + tx at your local Big Lots or Christmas Tree shop. Would probably make a good stocking stuffer for those with large ear canals. .bh."
2,Sound great but different length wire,Left ear wire is 2 inches. Right ear wire is 8 inches. Fits very odd. Not sure the reason for this but it is not good. I wonder if this is a defect or if all are made with this problem.Sound is great but I want to use these when exercising and the loose off balance wire gets in the way.
3,Nice but not for small opening sized ears.,"I really had high hopes for these since reading the other reviews they seemed the perfect pair for my small ears. Unfortunately they are just as uncomfortable as the ear buds that come with the ipods. And...The WAY different length earbud wires are a bit annoying since your hands or other objects tend to get tangled in the longer wire. The Left earbud is about 5.5"" long while the Right earbud is about 18"" long. Not very user friendly. As far as sound quality goes I really don't know since I can't fit them in my ears to hear the sound properly. I had purchased 2 pair - 1 for my husband and 1 for myself since they were such a great price - but it looks like my husband is going to end up with both pair. I do like the fact that they came with the airline adapter. That is a definite plus. That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 or 1."
3,The News CAN be fun,"Satellite Night News is one of the most outrageously funny scifi books that I have ever come across, and I have come across many in my time. However, some of the humor contained in this novel is not suitable for young children, but you adults may find it quite amusing.The plot: Far in the future, News is the ULTIMATE form of entertainment, at least for those braving the wilds of space. Competing news networks vie for the highest ratings, and they are not all too concerned what they have to do for a story (which leads to some humorous moments). However, the news world is soon to be enmeshed in the ultimate news story: interplanetary war. The Satellite Night News team attempts to uncover the reasons for the war, and what they discover shocks them, a deep, deadly secret that may emperil the entire solar system!"
5,An excellent intro to microbiology for non-scientist,"I couldn't resist, I've read the whole book sitting on the floor of the bookstore that was selling it. I've bought it anyway, because it's worth every penny! It's a very concise reference, where a lot of complicated biochemical processes are explained with breathtaking simplicity. The most up-to-date issue for non professionals I've ever seen in a bookstore. Two thumbs up to the author! I gave it five stars, but it rather deserves ""five plus."" Highly recommended for everyone interested in Biology."
2,This book needs revision,"Yuck!I'm an experienced VC++, VB, COM, and MTS programmer for Window NT. I bought this book to help bring me up to speed with the changes for Windows 2000, specifically COM+ transactional services (the new MTS).First of all, the first 300 pages have little to do with COM+. It's a review of other programming issues, which belong in a different book. It's pure fluff and a waste of paper. Second, its treatment of transactions is very lacking. For example, it doesn't even discuss the importance of stateless development and that's very important to understand.Don't buy this book. Get ""Visual Basic and COM+ Programming by Example"" by Peishu Li or ""Programming Distributed Applications with COM+..."" by Ted Pattison or the golden oldie ""Distributed COM..."" by Jim Maloney (for NT)."
2,Not thrilled,"I was really disappointed in the performance of this palm sander. I usually do my research before purchasing tools, but I neglected to so this time and thought, ""Hey, with DeWalt you can't go wrong."" I was wrong. The power isn't there and the dust collection bag, which was a selling point for me originally, collects very little dust - maybe 20%, if that. What's worse, if you're not careful, the bag will just come right off because it's not securely fastened to the sander."
3,ok for the money,"i am a carpenter of fine furnituregood points:1. the sander has lots of power, works quickly on oily hardwoods too2. fits great in my hand3. easy to change sand paper4. long cordbad points:1. after 20 minutes of sanding the vibrations is too much. i never have this problem with my bosch 5"" orbital sander2. no dust goes into the dust collection bag. (yes, i used the hole puncher for the sandpaper). i have like 4 hours of use with this and the bag is clean inside. the only thing i can imagine is that the bag is used to filter the air before it goes into the motor!!!!! you will need to hook this up to a vacume for dust collection, if dust collection is even possible"
4,Great Palm Sander but hard to find now,"This was a great palm sander from Dewalt. I really can only echo what the other reviewers have said. This sander is really easy to use, has lots of power, fits your hand very well, is lightweight, and vibration is not bad. The biggest issues with it are the dust pickup is minimal (even when punching holes in the sandpaper), and it is a little noisy so hearing protection should be used, but I don't find it as loud as many other sanders.Overall I rate it 4 stars, and would give it 5 stars if the dust pickup was better. However, one positive is the dust bag is really easy to remove, and sometimes you want to remove it to get into tight spaces or angles.This sander is no longer made by Dewalt so you will have a hard time finding one. But you can still get very lightly used ones and they are a good option in my opinion. I haven't used the newer model from Dewalt, but it seems bigger and heavier, and doesn't fit my hand as well, so I prefer this older model."
5,Good time travel,"The ultimate in Mulligans. If you could do-over something, what would it be? Hogan's main character builds a machine that can send information to itself in the past. The new information's arrival in the past influences and changes the future that sent it. Good reading and shows how small events can trigger major changes for the character's lives"
4,"Good Read, worth visiting","I've read this book twice. Once when I was younger, and again recently. It was what I would consider a Good book. Hogan always seems to turn out an entertaining book, a book worth reading, but not a Snow Crash. I could read this book again when its turn comes up. Worth buying and reading."
5,Great book. Every man should read this if he is married or plans to be married.,This is a great book. Ken Nair does a really good job setting things forward in a intelligent yet easy to understand way. This book teaches Christian principles and has several Bible references to back up the conclusions. One of the main points is that husbands need to be loving to their wives. I'm sure that doesn't surprise anyone since it is clearly taught in the Bible. Ken shows how to become better at being a loving husband and how to have a better more loving relationship with your wife. This book is definitely worth reading!
3,Not as good as i thought,"Reading from a woman's point of view, I guess it is ok. To actually hope my husband will first of all read the book which is not as interesting as I thought is another issue. It just was not one of those I can't put it down till i am done kind of interesting books. It did however have on the money facts about women in general that men truly need to learn."
1,Discovering the Mind of a Woman,The book is not accurate. It doesn't address real marriage problems but only looks at men. Women have no responsiblity and I have seen this ruin marriages. The authors wife is the prime promoter. The book is good for men to help them understand women but lacks real marriage substance to have a lasting marriage according to the word of God.
4,Discovering the Mind of a Woman,This book is a must if you are married or looking to get married. THe truth of this book will open your eyes to what kind of a man and husband God wants us to be. THe truth will slap you in the face at times and release some of the bad habits we have grown up with thinking that they are just the way we are. Very enlightning and redeeming.Doug McGrail
2,Major Disappointment,"In short, Because man is a sinner, The Man in The Marriage is The Sinner, and The Woman is God's Gift The Man to straighten him out. This is *not* the lesson of Scripture, for *all* have sinned.The Christlike love that Ken says that the husband needs to show bears little resemblence to the real love that Christ demonstrates to the Church. It's like comparing skim milk to a full steak dinner.Christ's love is free to all, but is also costly and demanding of those who accept it. I think Ken misses this.Go read ""Love and Respect"" by Dr. Eggrichs instead."
1,The five star reviews are stacked - this book is garbage,"The author assumes that all men believe women are inferior and abuse their wives. The author says that woman do not have any sex drive and repeatedly states that husbands must be ""Christ like"" in their marriage. WTF? This book seems as though it was written in the 1800s by a religious fanatic. I bought this book to read on a trip but ended up throwing it the trash after skimming through it. There is nothing in this book worth reading. I trusted all the 5 star reviews thinking this would be a good book but it seems one person stacked the review by submitting multiple reviews. Someone with a sick sense of humor and I was fooled. I've never before attempted to read such a terrible book."
5,A Challenge to Christian Men to Live and Love as Christ,"This book challenges Christian men to stop blaming their wives for problems in the marriage relationship. Author Ken Nair shares on how his own marriage was affected when he made up his mind to begin treating his wife as Christ treats the Church. The ensuing death to his flesh brought about a better marriage than either he or his wife would ever have dreamed possible. He shares key principles on how to follow in Jesus' footsteps, and gives real-life examples to illustrate his points. If you are a married man who has been told that ""Nobody understands a woman's mind, not even women,"" then this book will destroy your illusions and force you to face your responsibility to understand your wife's mind. The benefits of doing so will be well worth the effort."
4,Good and usefull book.,"What can I say... a good book simple as that and more than glad to have it in my collection of travel books. I was surprised by the accuracy of the content, address, phone and e-mail (if mail) information (I am one of the nerds that really checks... arggg). What can I say... going to Ecuador and/or the Galapagos (been there, done that) bring this book with you. It's handy if you are in a need of a guide (book). It's light to bring yet contains lot's of useful information for one of these day you don't know but need a hint from your `guide'..For the mentioned price I think it's a winner...Ries"
2,Not Norton,"Have to agree with other reviewers that this is NOT real Norton, but based on her work. I really wanted to like it - But could not - there is just not enough Norton there. I cannot define it, but I grew up on her and Heinlein and this just misses the mark. It is a good story and worth reading, but does not come up to the standard of Norton. Even her western novels are better written. (Yes - this fantastic Science Fiction and Fantasy writer wrote some Western novels. Try them!)"
3,"Functional, if cheap feeling","For some reason it is incredibly hard to find a plain black corded phone that offers caller ID capabilities. This was one of the few we found that didn't have terrible reviews. The phone functions fine, sound quality is OK. The only real negative is the caller ID screen. Looked at from an angle, it is unreadable. You have to look at it straight on to see the number and name clearly. This means my tall husband is always bending over to see the caller ID on our wall mounted phone. Oh, and the cord provided for the phone jack is too long for a wall mount, so if you want to use this phone on the wall, you'll need to get a shorter cord somewhere else."
2,cheap phone- barely passable,"The first one I received was dead on arrival and I returned it. The screen is extremely difficult to read. Contrast settings are available, 1-8. It is not visible at all on the lower settings. On 7 or 8 one can see the readout but the background of rows of ""8""'s also becomes darker making it very difficult to decipher the information on the screen, i.e. 888888888888888 is seen on each row. On the loudest setting the volume is only fair."
1,Piece of Crap!,This piece of crap didn't work straight out of the box. Obviously quality control is not a priority for this Chinese manufacturer of trash! What else is new. Buyer Beware - You get what you pay for with this JUNK.
2,you get what you pay for,"This phone looks nice enough. The price is very good, but you get what you pay for. The phone has a very bad echo and very sluggish delayed response for the person at the opposite end. You can hear your q&a being echoed thru the opposite side of the conversation. Makes for an awkward talk. I knew what I was purchasing when I bought it; so I'm not upset. I bought this land line phone to use with my Majik jack, and that was horrific to say the least, so I though let me plug her in to a rj45/standard home phone jack and it was worse. The only thing I could do was laugh it off. I gave it to my middle grandson to toy about with it. All in all; not a complete waste."
1,got what it's worth...junk,"the id screen is not lit. need to use a flashlight when the room is dim. then, if not angled right, the readout is not legible. phone does not display caller id most of the time and instead notes a message error while ringing. i disconnect and reconnect the phone line to make it work again. this is almost a daily chore. a new, different phone is on my wish list."
4,8' Windmill,Great looking Windmill. Exactly what I was looking for. It will take a little time to assemble but seems to be very sturdy. There is a warning if placed in an area with STRONG winds without some blockage extra anchoring may be required.
5,Dg1890 windmill,"A great windmill, very durable, easy assembly and looks fantastic we are so glad we bought it. Great price for very good quality material, Will last for years."
4,Great addition to garden,"Fast delivery...well made...directions could be better...but, one picture worth thousand words..took me about a half hour to assemble...thinking of buying one for my daughter's birthday...."
5,Windmill,"Great product, looks nice in the yard or garden. Set aside time to assemble, many, many bolts and screws."
4,Very Well Made Windmill,"The Windmill was shipped in a very quick manner. Product is very well made. My existing windmill was NOT nearly as well made or structurally sound. Was able to put it together by myself. The only negative thing I can say about it, was the instructions were minimal, and one would have had to have experience in putting something like this together, or they would have difficulty in doing it. I would have preferred a star like bolt, which I think would have helped in tightening etc. I would recommend this American Made Product to anyone who likes the touch of a windmill to their yard. I expect years of enjoyment in seeing it."
4,Very please overall. Looks identical to advertised pic.,"Somewhat difficult to assemble otherwise I would give 5 stars. It takes 2 people and we spent approximately 3 hrs with all the braces, nuts and bolts. The directions were somewhat lacking and unclear. It would be beneficial to mark the parts if possible there are alot of them. Overall we love the finished product."
3,Only a moron would pay $90!,I bought the exact same windmill on ebay for $15. I love it after spending TWO DAYS assembling the damn thing. :(I used plastic margarine tubs to cast it in ready-mix concrete feet.Now I'm waiting for http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LHF2XI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 climbing rose to do its thing.
4,Classy book! The substance is iffy.,"This book has interesting essays on the (rather superficial) similarities between the Baroque and Minimalist eras. It also has tasteful photographic reproductions of the respective artforms. In short, the juxtaposition of the two styles through reflective essays and images is intellectually engaging, but not wholly convincing. The book itself is very well crafted and pretty, though. I would recommend this book for the musical/artistic amateur and anyone interested in the craft of small-scale bookmaking."
1,Trees had to die for this?,"Yep, it is, in my opinion, very bad (I can hardly use the word in connection with it) ""history."" Knowing that I love to read Civil War history, a relative gave me this book for Christmas, 2007; I read it in a couple of days. Geez. Invalid criteria, misreading of facts and invalid analysis are, in my opinion, the hallmarks of this book. Valuing my bookshelf space, I did the right thing: I wrote my 'Thank You' note, then pitched it.Its a good thing that trees are a renewable resource."
1,The biased truth,"Nolan fails to keep an unbiased attitude, which is difficult, yet viatal to historians, from encroaching on his historical facts. Some of his theories are good yet poorly supported. It was difficult to keep an open mind while reading this book because the author failed to do so and it shows in the writing. Lee was just like any other man that served in the Civil War, he was human. He made many mistakes like other Generals, and yet he fought to the best of his ability. His plans were disrupted by his subordinates as well as by the enemy. It would be interesting to see if ""those people"" have considered if Grant would have been able to accomplish what Lee did or didn't if they were fighting for the other sides. It's doubltful that Grant would have been able to get along with Davis as Lee did, and the results would have been the same, a Union victory"
1,Nolan presents a nearow minded view of the confederacy.,"Alan Nolan gives no evidence to support his theorys and he disregards everything that has ever been said about lee. I agree that lee is marbalized and he isn't as great and powerful as he is build up to be, but he was one of the greatest generals to ever command on a battle field. Lee might have been part of the confederacy, but he shouldn't be pursacuted for being loyal to his home state. If anything he should be praised for fighting for what he thought was right."
1,Revisionist junk.,"Nolan's work is an insult to one of America's greatest heroes. With the historical perspective of a Yankee and the mistrusting mind of a lawyer, Nolan nit picks, misinterprets, and cross examines his way through history. Read the primary and secondary sources for yourself and stay away from Nolan's revisionist garbage."
4,Lee without the deification,"Up until now, Robert E. Lee has been treated as a Southern savior, without blame for any of the failures of the Civil War. In fact, in order to maintain the Lee legend, blame has been heaped upon others in order to save the myth (James Longstreet comes to mind). Nolan's book is a point by point rebuttal of many of the trappings of Lee's story and backs it with documentary proof. At long last, some balance is added to the mix. I also recommend Freeman's 4 volume biography, but one should read Nolan's book also to temper the hero worship found in Freeman's monumental work."
5,"At Last, An Iconoclast Stands Up","It is so good to see someone stand up to this false idol of the neo-confederates. It's high time someone took him down and analyzed him as the very fallable human being he was and the repulsive cause he and his armies fought for. Don't listen to these neo-confederates reviews, his book is stacked with evidence, mostly stuff from LEE'S OWN MOUTH.I'd encourage anyone to get this book. It's far more enlightening than anything you'll read that comes from the rationalizations of Southern revisionists."
2,Lee on the stand,"I am not a huge fan of Lee and i do not defend him or his actions. with that being said, i feel that Mr. Nolan's book was nothing more than repeated attacks on Lee with a lack of supporting evidence. Nolan tries to make many points but when he goes to support those points, the evidence does not credit him. He uses 1 or 2 documents to try and bring down the Lee tradition. it would seem to me that he wants to make ripples in the water by attacking the South's premier icon. With a library card, you can get the most use out of this book by reading chapter 4, I think any civil war historian can find that information in that chapter usefull and enlightening. other than that, Unless you are highly intersted in Lee, i do not recommend you to buy this book"
3,Lee Scholarship Reconsidered,"Nolan puts forth a thesis I don't agree with. However, I believe he isn't really critical of General Lee as much as scholarship on the general. He cites letters to destroy certain ideas about the American Icon. His arguments about Lee's offensive tactics are totally wrong. A defensive strategy would have doomed the Confederacy at an early date. Lee did the only thing he could do, fight. Now days it is fashionable to debunk our nations heros. But Mr. Nolan should realize that General Lee is not at fault, the historians may be. It is easy to Monday morning quarteback. General Lee was an excellent general and a product of the 19th Century. Honor was an important concept to him. People today don't understand that at all. The author also uses a legalize argument which takes away from his historical points. Freeman is more in line with how Lee really was, not Nolan."
1,"Interesting Idea, but Not Backed Up!","This book seemed like a big deal. A critical biography of Lee. The author said he would prove Lee a poor commander and a defender of slavery. Popular notion is that Lee was one of our greatest Generals and against slavery. Nolan makes some bold statements. They are intriguing. HOwever, in no chapter of this book does he prove any of his accusations. In short, this book is all talk and no substance. If you are going to claim Lee was a poor commander, prove it. This is not a very good book."
2,A need analyis but poorly executed,The is no question that Lee the man is diffrent from Lee the legend but Nolan makes the same mistakes he critizes other historians for making. The books tone suggests that Nolan wrote his analysis first and then found a small number of facts and quotes to back up his view. Nolan seems to ignore and throw out primary and secondary information that does not support his thesis.
3,Good Start on an Interesting Subject,"Nolan's book is a a good start on a very interesting subject. It is a fine essay that forces one to look at Lee as a fallable human being rather than a legendary leader. The best compliment that one can give to Nolan, and to any author, is that it made me intersted in the subject and caused me to read more about Lee's generalship."
3,Interesting but choppy,I like this book but it does not flow well. It's choppy and I kept getting lost about where he was and who he was talking with from one story to the next. Nothing connects. Some of the stories are entertaining but there are better travel books out there.
4,Good read - interesting stories,"I have finshed this book recently and although reading English is not easy for me, I really enjoyed it. The stories were very interesting, often humorous and with some characters that I will remember a long time. For a long book, it was easy to read and never boring. It is always a nice surprize to find a unknown author and book that has so many good qualities with strong stories told very well. Recommended."
4,Enjoyable,"I read many non fiction books - and this one was recommended by a friend. I really found it enjoyable, informative and personal. Reminded me of encounters I have had and how they can be told as great stories. Its a book that makes you stop and think and that is a great feature in a changing world where little is what it seems anymore."
1,This is seriously dangerous cookware.,"I dont know who is writing these good reviews though they sound like anchor people themselves are writing this. THESE PIECES WILL EXPLODE!!! either in your oven, in your hand or on your counter top DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!"
3,"A Noble Effort, But. . .","Gustaf Stromberg's work here was a noble effort in its time-- the late 1930's-- to grapple with the metaphysical and supposed scientific underpinnings of the soul. Unfortunate that he couldn't have encountered contemporary William Sadler's writings on the evoluton of the soul during his research; The eventual publication of the Urantia Papers revealed such a superlative understanding of the soul, that book's like Stromberg's become anachronisms before their time."
3,She was french gypsy,"Goldie's world had tumbled down. But that was seven years ago and out of the ruins she had built a new life, with a new name. Marie Doumerque had no desire to be reminded of the past. So why had she fallen into Rayner millard's arms so easily when he'd turned up at the chateau in France? Was Rayner really her destiny? and was his rekindled passion fuelded by love or a desire for revenge?"
5,Fun book from Mac history,"My brother bought this book years ago in college. It had a ton of good info for college students at the time, and it was just a great *fun* book in general.Very outdated now, but I'd love to get it again just to have it as a part of Mac history."
1,Piece of junk,"I guess you get what you pay for, so I wasn't totally surprised that the battery didn't work. What was worse is that when I sent it back to get a new one, they instead just refunded me a PART of what I paid for it. Don't do business with these guys, and don't buy this battery."
5,Be prepared to learn nautical language,"This can be a difficult book to find for a reasonable price. I paid about $24 here at Amazon for a new copy.If you are new to wooden ship kits you've learned that the kits - which can cost hundreds of dollars - come with detailed plans that are surprisingly bereft of the kind of instructions and practical tips a novice builder really needs. The included plans will not be enough.This book can help. Connecting with other builders will help more. I was lucky to find a web site - Model Ship Builders - that had a builders log for the very model I am building. Pages of tips and lots of photos recording the building of this model. This book, and that builder's log, answer most of my novice questions.Nice book. Model kits are full of parts and this book changed my references from ""little doohicky"" to ""cat head"" and ""scupper"". Really helps since the kit didn't come with a single ""doohicky"".Good buy. Good luck."
4,Very nice book!,"I am a gastroenterologist practicing in Japan. In this country, the specific book such as ""Gastrointestinal Oncology"" is very rare. This book is very well written in the field of gastrointestinal cancer. I had learned and enjoyed it. The shortcoming is the references are a little bit old. I'm looking forward to the revised edition."
4,Interesting read,"My taste usually runs to literary rather than genre fiction, but The Depths of the Sea held my interest and attention. A complete dearth of knowledge regarding the history of the area and era won't impact your enjoyment of it (at least it didn't for me)."
5,Brahma Kumaris,"The book is interesting and calming, however, I have to wonder about the harmony and peace when I recently encountered some of the members of this group and they seem more on the negative side than positive. the male world was bashed, as the reference with all that is wrong with the world. This followed by down grading of other religious beliefs. Next came the God loves the rich movie stars etc., they are more chosen, by virtue of wealth? Pretty strange ideas to me."
5,"Elegant, lyrical, original, joyous, and inspiring","Kathleen Wakefield's poetry is elegant, lyrical, original, joyous, and inspiring.A Reply: If for a moment you believe the heart/hangs on a word,/like the soul on a matter of faith --/that memory or desire might flare/like the red flame of the window drape flung back/into the dark corner, or that this light/surely must have passed through high branches,/layers of new leaves all morning long.//Observe how this outer light/articulates the smooth, high brow/and washes a blinding white the window ledge,/the curled half of the page/she's already read.//Oh, it hardly matters/that we'll never know who he is,/or her reply, for the story is always/the same: what's been said and left unsaid,/how the light changes."
3,"Wow, that's a lot of planets!","I read my copy of Classic Star Wars Volume One as a way to remember my grandmother. The comic is a reformatted version of the Star Wars newspaper strip by the legendary Archie Goodwin and Al Williamson. Gran received the Sunday edition of the strip and would cut it out for me every week to mail to me every few months; it's interesting to have a lot of the missing material filled in. Williamson is a master of science fiction illustration, he's of the mindset of ""If there is a panel of a spaceship flying over a planet why not fill every square inch of space with a gazillion planets, asteroids, and weird looking spacecraft whenever possible. I love the aliens that wear humanoid spacesuits but who's heads look like wads of chewing gum with bugged eyes. Definitely takes me back to my childhood."
3,Nostalgic!,"I remember these from the newspaper, and even tried to save some of them! (newsprint, & time don't get along) The stories were imaginative, the art acceptable, and it was STAR WARS!"
3,An O.K. representation,"I found that the time between Star Was: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back was too short for all of the events that happened in the comics. If it were placed in a different time, then maybe it could have been better"
1,Useless,I bought these for my office use. It is a nice looking handset (plasticky feel though). The positives stop there.You hear a TINNY voice on either side. All my colleagues and friends who have spoken to me has mentioned this when I talk over this phone.The user interface is terrible. It is extremely cumbersome to even change the date and time on this set.Stay away from this piece of junk if possible. If you got this as a gift... stay away from the person who gave it you ;-)
2,You get what you pay for!!,"Its very cheep flag, my test is i put it in a wind storm and most of the flags do ok but this one did horrible!! Its completely ruined and i cant fly it anymore, also the picture is not the real flag the blue is very light making it look cheep also"
3,Where was quality control?,"The watch works well, but the rubber ring/gasket sealing the back had a section sticking out when I got it from Amazon. I would have thought that, if the factory had a human being inspect each item, this would have been blatantly visible. Other than that odd lack of good quality control (and I had a local jeweler replace the gasket), a good watch."
4,Very nice watch but Amazon misrepresented.,"I am enjoying the watch and it looks as good as expected, but Amazon represented this watch as water resistant to 330m. Once received the watch shows itself as water resistant to 100m."
1,NOT The Originals,"Once again, a cheap rip-off, which does not contain the originals. This is either the artist re-recording his hits many years later (Always a Bad Idea), or, since the CD is made by a company called Passport Audio, it is more likely a sound-alike singer abusing these great tunes. Save your money and music sensitivities for the originals, as found on ""The Best Of Brooke Benton Endlessly"". This waste of plastic rates zero stars."
3,Interesting,"I read this book for my Humanities class, I did enjoy the magical elements of it and found it to be a very interesting book. Although I did find it good, it's not my favorite."
5,"Great, Accessible Translation","This edition of the Sundiata epic is a prose translation, and as such it reads more like a novel than an epic (personally, I'm not a big fan of poetry and find that quite helpful). A prose version also, I find, allows for the inclusion of more details, and so the characterizations and smaller details of the story come out more. Reading this right after The Mabinogion, I was surprised at the often prominent role that women played in the story. While Sundiata is, of course, the central character, his mother and the other women have more complex personalities and take more active parts in the epic than the one-dimensional, damsel-in-distress women of many European tales. Sundiata is not only an epic story about a legendary king, however; it also includes details of the history, geography, and culture of the area. The entire time I was reading it, I found Sundiata to be enjoyable rather than the often tedious, slow, and difficult read that I generally expect from epics."
3,DW400 review,I purchased my DW400 over a year ago and love it. It has enough power to handle the larger jobs that I wouldn't even consider trying with my old grinder. I have had no problems with it after lots of use and more than a little abuse.
3,Cute flag for the money.,"This flag is a cute flag for a clubhouse, playset, etc. Durable for the price. Has lasted through several high wind/rain storms. Our son loves it!"
5,Lots of fun!,"My 2 year-old received this for Christmas and she just adores it. She likes anything to do with animals, and these are perfect for her little hands. We'll sit for hours and make the puppies go down the slide. We've also purchased some of the pony sets as well based on her love of this toy."
2,I would love to recommend this but ...,"This software is fast, capable, and easy to use. If only it didn't crash so much. I've updated my drivers, reinstalled the application, etc. to no avail. Sigh. I just cannot recommend version 2.0.1."
1,Not worth the cost,Not enough features to justify the cost. basically does what a lot of free software does. Don't buy it.
4,Mike Hammer TV Series,"This is a TV series from the fifties (1958-59). Many famous people that are up and coming at the time play supporting roles in the episodes. Mini 28 minute 50s noir in black and white that is mostly enjoyable, although, due to the time limit, the resolutions come a little too quick and everything is solved. But, that was 50s television-mostly half hour shows.Darren McGavin is always good, and you can see the Kolchak character developing in these teleplays. Video and audio quality is surprisingly good given the length of time these were first produced. All in all, a good package that is complete-NO ""Vol. 1"",""Vol.2"" sold separately."
5,Vintage series,First saw Darren Mcgavin in Mike Hammer in the early 1960s and I loved it then and am happy to be able to watch them again thanks to Amazon.
3,Why is he named Hammer,"For me a 3 star rating means I liked it but probably won't view it several times. I loved the series when I was a kid. It's still entertaining, and it highlights how things have changed in America since then. I've viewed the first two disks. Each episode consists of the presentation of a situation. Mike finds a suspect and tortures information from him or her. The espisode usually ends with Mike shooting the villian. The stories are simplistic and politically incorred for modern times. The Hammer character in the films is toned down from the cruel Hammer in the books. In the films he is a good guy using cruel methods. Darren McGaven does an appealing job as Hammer."
4,Darren McGavin has his scrapping clothes on...,"Darren McGavin was one of my favorites and it was a surprise to find outhe played Mike Hammer in this early series. Definitely a low budget productionbut gritty and worth a watch. Wish someone would get McGavin's series ""TheOutsider"" out on DVD, it was a real hoot."
3,Please - Add Closed Captioning,"This show was made from 1957-1959. I LOVED it & loved Darren McGavin. However, I am now in my 60's & have some hearing problems, as do many people in my age group. We seniors are the people who remember this show & would love to enjoy it all over again. We NEED Closed Captioning. I will not purchase until it is added."
5,AH! The good old days.,"Darren McGavin is the best in this series, he is a Mike Hammer, just like Mickey Splillane has written him. I am 76 years old and I loved this series, and if you are a true lover of detectives you will love this series too. Believe me, this series is well worth the price, I hope this organization will produce the reproduction of ""RICHARD DIAMOND"" starring David Janssen, it too is a wonderful series. Live a long life (and please bring back those wonderful cars and music)."
1,this DVD is defective and I need to return to amazon and ask for refund,"When I play this DVD it play whole disc and when I remove first and put second disc on it, it did not come on at all, then I remove it to play third disc, same problems,so to be sure I have my own disc, that is, other movies' and put it on, it play perfect, so I suspect that this disc is defective and need to return and would like to know what must I do to return. waiting for reply.from willie"
5,Excellent woodworking resource,"Excellent set of books, and the DVD is invaluable. You get to see a master at work while he gives reasons about his methods."
3,village of painters,"This was more like a ""family of painters"" rather than a ""village of painters"" as noted in the book's title. The content encouraged me to find out more about this type of art. Was disappointed that it was not hardcover; seemed overpriced for a paperback."
3,Great taste...pain to strain,You know I really do love this product. I wish I could give the tea 5 stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other embellishments. The problem is it's loose and when you are trying to make a big jug of it with two packets of tea it is a huge mess to strain. And ordinary double mesh strainer is not fine enough. I don't have coffee strainers in the house so I had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain. But when I strained it with just my mesh strainer there was a ton of tea in the jug. I wish the variety pack came pre-bagged like the smaller boxes of tea do.
1,A few hours of my life I can never get back,"This is the second book by Proulx I have read and I hate both of them. They are boring, run on and on, badly need some editing, and are not exciting. The character of Vicky Lucci is so unbelievable, she may as well be a cartoon character. I love a good mystery, and I enjoy humor mixed in, but this author just doesn't cut it for me. Bad Medicine turned into a bad experience for this reader."
1,Very HIGH Failure Rate,"JVC Camcorders are highly UNreliable. Once they begin to display errors, you are done. This may occur very shortly after purchase. I received the infamous ""Unit in safeguard mode error E04"" and that was the end of it. Got some other errors. I did everything the camera (and instructions) told me to do...change the batter, bought a new battery, cleaned the head etc... But it just does not matter. You will get errors. And once you have these errors, the camera refuses to work. And in some cases, it refuses to simply stay ON long enough to do anything at all, including getting your tape out of it.There are too many other GOOD digital camcorders out there. Don't buy JVC."
1,JVC Unit in general,"DO NOT buy JVC products. The digital units in general have a VERY high failure rate and JVC turns a blind eye to it's customers. They are happy to charge you 50% or better to perform ineffective repairs to the units which last a very short time. The most common error is ""Unit in safeguard mode error E04"" which can occur within days of purchase. Save yourself the hassel and by anything other than a JVC product."
1,Buyer Beware -- JVC mini DV camcorders,"I can tell you from personal experience with JVC mini camcorders that purchasing one is an expensive mistake. Even with a protection plan from Circuit City, Best Buy, etc., the units are EXTREMELY fragile (esp. the cassette loading/ejecting apparatus) and the now infamous ""E04 Safeguard Mode"" (go ahead, Google it) message will eventually appear and that will be the end of recording digital videos with a JVC mini DV camera. Further, JVC support is nonexistent with regard to these error messages and how to correct them."
1,This Product Will Die on You,"I was very happy with this camcorder....until it died on me after 10 months. I bought this for the basketball team I coach (to tape games). It was used a total of 25 times, and then it started getting error codes. It irrepairable, and I'm stuck buying a new one. Invest in a slightly more expensive model (by a DIFFERENT company). It well worth the money."
5,Great boots,"They're comfortable. I can wear them all day without any issues. The workmanship will last for years, and the leather holds a BEAUTIFUL shine!Well worth the investment."
4,Review,"Just received the boots. first time I buy Corcoran in 12 years of military duty. Usually had rocky, lowa and meindl.Positive:Quality seems good. Stitches look fine and the boots look great with a nice ""shiny"" touch. Went out for a small 2 hrs walk and can definitely say that they are comfortable but will need a couple of miles to break them. ankle is well held.Negative: I would say original laces look fragile, but I can't say for sure cause I just got them. Time will tell, nevertheless that's no big deal cause you can always change them.Usually I wear 10 or 10.5 D. I knew that jump boots were usually bigger so I took 10"" D and they fit perfectly in length, but the width is a bit tight. Just need some time and the leather will get softer and it will be ok."
5,Excellent price for a great product,"My husband likes this. He says it lathers nicely, smells great and his skin feels refreshed, not greasy."
1,Audiovox customer service,Beware of Audiovox customer service. My unit has been inoperable for 6 months. I have sent in in twice (Paid for shipping)and got an inoperable unit back both times. They are now asking me to send it in again (on my dime). I am cutting my loose and running as fast as I can.
1,Package not received,I never received the package. Mailman advised me it was stolen before delivery. Post Office advise me that only the sender can put in a claimon insurance.
1,Antenna broke twice,"I really like Sirius, but bought both this boombox and a car unit last year and the tiny piece at the end of the antenna where it plugs into the unit has broken off twice. It's a very small, but vital part of the system so I can't use any of the system without it. Audiovox wants me to have the original receipt (bought many months ago) along with the broken unit or else they will charge $25.95 for the replacement.The whole system is only as good as its weakest part and there's no way to replace this part for a reasonable price. This part needs to either be improved or there needs to be some cheap way to splice a new one on when it breaks."
1,"Sirius is great, but not this boom box!","I am a very happy Sirius owner (I use the tuner in my car and at home), but I am on my second version of the boom box and they both failed. At random times, it beeps and stops putting out volume, even though the unit retains power and the signal is strong (you can even change channels and see the correct description of every show). The helpful guys at a local electronics store could figure out the problem, so they exchanged the unit for me. The second version is doing the same thing. Note that the unit never exhibits this behaviour in the car or the home adapter.Highly recommend Sirius if you're not already a subscriber, but this boom box has design flaws."
1,"Goto XM, Serious is junk","Here are the negatives:-worst customer service of any business I purchased something through (and I also work in a customer service job, so I know). They cannot help you with equipment problems, instead they tell you to call Audiovox, who still can't help and will not try.- Signal on boom box rarely comes in. Fades in and out worst than any AM/FM radio station. If it doesn't work when and were you want, then what is the advantage over regular radio?-Receiver heats up big time!-I hope your office window faces the right direction!-No CD player? With today's technology integration, you gotta be kidding!Positives-If they have a talk show on you can't get on the internet, them maybe it is worth it if you can stand the crappy equipment.-If work does not allow you to use i-net for streaming audio, and you don't want X-M, then buy this soon-to-be antique."
5,Old Testament Light,Very helpful in understanding why bible writers wrote the way they did. The copy was in very good condition. I am thoroughly enjoying it.
3,It isn't what I thought...,I ordered it and got it and it isn't what I thought it'd be. It's not as cute and stuff as I thought.
5,Anyone can relate to this!!!!!,This book is one that once you start reading you won't be able to stop. It's very interesting.
4,A Pleasent Suprise,"I, like many of the reviewers who have posted, got this book in the assumption that it was the story of the deer that Disney made a movie of..I learned quickly that it was not, however, my disapointment disolved once I got further into the read to find that the story was actually rather charming with quirky characters and an interesting plot..it's not a story everyone could get into, but I did find it a decent read, concidering it's free."
4,"Not to be judged by its ""cover"" (title).","This is a charming tale from a time gone by. Do not judge too quickley, give it a chance and its charms will envelope you. P.S. I too aquired this because I thought it was the free version of the story about the deer. Glad I read it anyway."
4,Good book,This story about Bambi told me that anything can be achieved in life with a positive attitude and a wonderful personality.
1,Definatly not the story of a deer!,The only reason i got this bookwas i thought it was the story of a deer. i am an animal lover so when i saw the book i thouht deer. the first pages aren't so good an i do not wish to read from this auther again
5,In the Company of Women,"What a wonderful idea! Trish Schiesser has done an incredible job of compiling inspired and compelling works by an extraordinary group of talented writers. This book is a tribute to her generous spirit as she ""champions"" the creative pursuits of the featured authors. I am a fan of southern literary fiction and was delighted to see Brenda McClain included. I was mesmerized by her book, Willie June, at the Maui Writer's Conference this year and cannot wait to see how the story turns out. Great work Trish!"
3,"Sweet, sad, sometimes sexy and funny -- 3.5 stars","3.5 stars. I love Barbara Metzger. Most of her regency romance novels are fairly comedic, but this one was more serious. A heart-warming story involving some adorable twins, a lonely and proud nobleman, and a loving but strong-willed heroine.I would give it four stars, but the H and h did not spend enough time together, and the HEA resolution was not quite satisfying enough for me. There was a long separation and a big misunderstanding, which I'm not crazy about. Still, a pleasant story!My favorite by Metzger is the one about the noblewoman, Lady Sparrow, who seeks out all her dead husband's illegitimate children and gives them a home. It's funny and quite sexy, the hero is yummy, and I loved all the kids!Lady Sparrow: Signet Regency Romance (InterMix). That's a 5-star read."
5,Loved it!,"My new favorite author! Another all nighter. Romance, desire,fun and humor all put together so well I just couldn't put it down! Finding all her books are exceptional, without all of the wasted pages of someone else's idea of sex or religion. Thank you for renewing my faith in writers again! You take us to the brink of some wonderful places in some fantastic new story lines while allowing the reader to use their own imagination in some very private and personal areas! Very refreshing! I love your books!!"
2,What Happened???,"I consider Barbara Metzger one of my favorite authors... but this book was awful!!! It was choppy, hard to get into, didn't explain things very well & jumped a lot."
2,not what the title says it is,"A man named the Silver Eagle goes around fighting and killing off other kung-fu ""masters"" so he can become the best. Eventually he kills the Shaolin Temple master, whose granddaughter and son (Mo) then try to take their revenge. Mo meets an old beggar who teaches him to fight and who also teaches him humility. Finally the beggar, the granddaughter, and Mo join together to do battle with the Silver Eagle.The fight scenes are okay, but this movie has nothing to do with the drunken monkey style, monkey style, or even drunken fist/boxing style. I repeat, those styles are NOT in this movie, although (regular) monkey may be alluded to in a few scenes. Personally, I got the movie because I'm interested in kung fu styles and drunken monkey is not in a lot of movies, so I was pretty disappointed when I watched the movie and found out it wasn't there."
3,ABSOLUTELY NO DRUNKEN MONKEY STYLES IN THIS!!,"This flick was produced 1985,,,but the Wu Tang Clan DVD transfer is extremely, unbelievably and remarkably crappy.Elton Chong performed brilliantly in this flick,,however, I'm not sure why they called this ""Shaolin Drunken Monkey"", since there's like no drunken monkey styles in it period. The fight scenes were greatly choreographed. This flick was interesting to watch from start to finished. I would definatly recommend it, but the copy I purchased was my worse experience. Therefore, this flick being a 4 star movie recieved only 3 starsfrom me!!"
4,The Shaolin Drunk Monkey ROCKS!,"The Shaolin Drunk Monkey is a good kung-fu flic. I first watched it over at a friends house a few years back, I wasn't sure if I liked it at the time but I ended up buying it a couple of years later and I really enjoy it. It has some cheesey music and it does get alittle slow at times but for the most part it's pretty action packed and will keep you ethier laughing or cheering either way."
3,doesn't work for i pod touch,"doesn't work for i pod touch, I gave it to a friend of mine, he likes it."
5,"A Very Honest, Informative, and Personal Book","In the 1980s Dr Sinatra trained with Alexander Lowen in bioenergetic therapy. They collaborated on Lowen's bookLove, Sex, & Your Heartbut perhaps Dr Sinatra did not get to fully place his vision in that book, because this seems to be his version of a book on love and the heart. Both books are enormously informative. I am always incredibly impressed when someone with a reputation to upheld is honest and revealing about personal suffering, as Dr Sinatra is here. In his current website, Dr Sinatra seems more interested in nutritional approaches, than in emotional or bodywork approaches. I am curious why that is."
1,I do not recommend this book for doll repair education,"This book is an advertisement-whole book features different artists that tell about themselves. The last few pages have instructions on making outfits for dolls. I am looking for an educational book on re-rooting, re-painting doll faces, vinyl repair, etc and was very disappointed in this book-it is useless for learning how to restore dolls."
3,Not too shabby,"It cuts well if you keep it sharp. Hell, what do you want for 15 bucks? Made in China by the enemy."
5,"Great ""How-To"" book for dog owners!","I found this book very well written, well researched and comprehensive. She covers all the basic topics that are of use to novice dog owners. She also warns of typical pitfalls in a number of areas -- when selecting a dog, when training, it, and so on. In addition she outlines the extent of coverage of dogs on the Internet. I liked her book quite a bit, and that's <i>not</i> because of the plugs she gave to <i>my</i> site *smile*. Seriously, this is the only book I've reviewed that I've given a 10 to. Thinking of getting a dog? Do yourself and the puppy a big favor, get this book!"
2,simplifies dog ownership,"This book does a pretty good job and giving the reader the highlights of dog owenership. Its also a pretty good starting point if you are trying to find a breed. However, it is too simple if you have already purchased a dog and now want to care for it properly."
5,Five paws up!,"If you've never owned a dog, read this book before you get one. Tells you how to buy, how to train, what equipment to get, how to care for a sick dog AND pick out a vet, and an overview of showing. If you have a dog already, there's still plenty of useful info. Highly recommend!"
3,Good if you already know you want to get a dog,"I didn't like the book as much as I had thought because I was a complete dummy about having a dog as a pet and needed as much detailed information as possible. For example, how much does it cost to raise a ""typical"" dog? Or, what are the different personalities of different breeds? I can't find that information in this book.There is a lot of useful info for the dog-keeping virgin, but I just wish there were more. Maybe a second edition?"
3,Dogs for dummies,"Clearly written, good information and good overview of info new dog owners will need. However,could use more detail in several sections such as obedience or manners training."
1,"Real dogs need real care Not ""dummies"" info","This book is so full of misinformation that I shudder to think (since it is in the ""dummies"" series), that this may be the only information that many people will read before they embark upon a very serious commitment with a dog.It is poorly researched, full of dogma and nonsense.If you have to read a ""quick book"" find one written by an expert - a veterinarian, or anyone with a track record in animals. Instant info can be found on bulletin discussion boards, magazines etc."
1,a dissapointment,I have always wanted a windmill for my home.This was one of the worst built products I have ever purchased.Not long after buying this product it fell apart.All the blades came loose.I have had to repair them twice!I would not ever again purchase from this company!
3,Does what it says.....,"Nothing special about this product. When used correctly, it gets the job done. Will buy again and recommend to others,"
5,Fast jewelery shine-up,The jewelery cloth cleans and shines up jewelery so quickly it is wonderful. I don't know how I lived without it for so long.
1,Don't bother,"This was aweful, its painful to watch. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. The colors and sound were terrible, it didin't even hold my son's attention for 30 seconds."
1,VCI VERSION - CDR COPY,This is just to alert any potential purchasers of this title ordering the VCI version. The one I have just received is a CDR copy. Nowhere in the product details is this mentioned. This is the second VCI title I have received like this. The same thing when I ordered their version of Undersea Kingdom. Both have been returned for refunds and I have re-ordered the Alpha versions instead. You have been warned.
3,A rambling 4 hours......,"Great cover art, but the program is a 4-hour free flowing narrative about various UFO events and theories over the past 50+ years. In fact, there is actually very little ""footage,"" rather lots of still pictures and narration. I guess you'd call it an entertaining 4 hour slide show."
3,Comprehensive and fascinating,"You don't have to be a real buff to enjoy this. Though similar to the author's UFOs Don't Exist! DVD, this is a more comprehensive look, and covers other sightings. It's in the same style: narrated lecture/slideshow, and the images are well-picked and to the point. There is also news footage, mostly clips from Fox News.The DVD covers the spotting of spacecraft throughout the ages, then the explosion of evidence after WWII, when personal cameras became widespread. The film documents strange animal abductions and mutilations, Roswell, Stephenville, and dozens of other sightings, crashes and incidents. The real-life ""men in black"" seem to show up afterwards, adding to the general suspicion that the US and other governments know far more than they're telling.I could have done without the generic background music, but for amateur UFO researchers, this DVD is a must, I think, and you're sure to find sightings near you mentioned. Fascinating stuff. Watch the skies!"
4,Fun,"This was fun. It gives all kinds of information about UFO sightings, people's experiences, etc. and I had fun watching it. Definitely full of information, & entertaining."
5,Easy to use and accurate,"I am a physician. The reading on this machine matches very closely to manual reading. In the end, the only thing that matter with automated BP machine is its accuracy. So far it has performed well."
5,"""Big Winners and Big Losers"" is a big winner","In ""Big Winners and Big Losers"" Professor Marcus continues his long tradition of providing important insights into the world of business strategy and management. Like all of his work, the book is both rigorously researched and well written. Unlike so many of the cliché-based popular management books in the market today, ""Big winners and Big Losers"" focuses on the underlying tensions and dynamics required to build and sustain successful strategies that allow firms to identify and operate successfully in today's changing business environment. The examples, recommendations and advice in the book are superior. It is definitely a must read."
2,Gender of History,"This book fails to present any new argument for the treatment of women historically. It does point out that women have been ignored over the centuries but most of us already knew that. The use of technical language, assumed foreknowledge of historical figures and an overestimated understanding of historical process make this book inappropriate for most undrgraduates. Graduate students should be able to muddle their way through most of the book and it is also a book for academic collections."
2,Not what I had hoped.,"There must have been a tiny amount of catnip as my cats totally ignored these toys. They usually go nuts for catnip toys, but they didn't even play with them."
4,Good camera,"Really enjoy this little camera. Good size for taking almost anywhere. Only con was the programs for uploading onto the computer or making movies was quickly outdated and had difficulty finding new ones. We just watch the videos by plugging the camcorder into the tv. Was able to record for hours before battery faded. Good picture quality, clear sound, and the light is sufficient for recording in low light settings."
1,don't do it!,"JVCs are great if you don't need any accessories or never need customer service. if you do you are in trouble. I bought a JVC video recorder last year and despite it being new it came without most of the accessories offered with it--things you'll probably need such as the cable to connect it to the TV and the one to connect it to the computer. I had to buy each of these for $40 each--they would not ship them, and also had to buy the software that was supposed to come with the camera. after all that, the leads broke and the camera started eating tape. the customer service was useless and I finally just threw it out. I had owned this JVC product for less than a year and will never buy another one."
1,Lens Cap,"Junk. You will get a lens cap error in about a year or so, where it will tell you lens cap is on and you will not be able to record anymore."
1,Broken,"I thought my JVC Digital Camera was handy, easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was... then one day at my daughter's ballet show, I turned it on (I made sure I charged it all night) and it wouldn't record. It kept saying that the lens cap was on. I am so frustrated and sad. I spent a good chunk of money on this item and don't know what happened... still don't have a way of recording my daughter's milestones....Don't buy it, if you have other options."
5,Cheapest place to buy it,"Forget buying this camcorder at a retail store!! I originally bought the GDG33 version (the next version below this one) at Walmart. I returned it because I found this version (GRD72) at www.buydig.com for $75 cheaper!!! The lesson is: Research over the internet to find the product you want, go to the retail stores to get a hands on look, then go back to the internet and search for the cheapest (and still reliable) store to purchase it. Do your research on the internet store to make sure it is a reputable company."
4,Moving and Informative,"I had always admired Eric Liddell from what I knew of his story from the movie ""Chariots of Fire."" This thoroughly researched and well-written account of his entire life (only a couple of chapters focus on the time surrounding the '24 Olympics) moved me to tears several times. He lived an honest and committed life--one that is inspirational for those of us coming after him. I highly recommend this book."
3,Very large,The mask attracted a lot of people! but it was too large i had to wear a jacket with a hood to hide the backside of it.
1,2pac mask,"pretty bad product. when i got it, it didnt even look much like the online pic. plus the fit was terrible. i wouldnt recommend it."
4,Nice,Great mask. A bit too big for my head but it will work. Had to open the eyes a bit more so I can see out of it. Resembles the rapper 2pac.. I am satisfied and happy with the mask. I wish i was a full mask fitting over my head instead of the draw string. Will go great with my costume.
4,"NICE DESIGN, full mask would be better though.","I think this is a neat mask, because the design is good and you can tell it's supposed to resemble the rapper Tupac as soon as you look at it. When I got the mask, it was a bit mashed up during shipping, but I was satisfied when it returned to it's natural shape after hanging for a few days. I'm happy with the mask, but I wish it was a full mask that went all the way around the head and face...this one doesn't, it has a strap in the back. I recommend it though."
5,"Packed with action, yet full of fluff!","Well, the battle with Sesshoumaru and Toukijin is now over, but that still doesn't solve the problem with the heavy Tetsusaiga. Now Kouga's back, but he's far from the worst of the group's trouble. Naraku appear yet again, this time with the emotionless Juromaru and the murderous Kageromaru as his new incarnations. Will the group and Kouga be able to survive the battle with these new villians? Later, Kikyou shows up yet again, and Naraku's as determined as ever to end her life. But when Kagome spots Inuyasha and Kikyou together, she flees to her time. Will she ever go back? Will Inuyasha come get her? Will Kagome's feelings for Inuyasha finally be revealed?!?!?! You'll just have to watch the DVD to find out. A must have for the continuation of the Inuyasha DVD's."
2,Paula's Home Cooking..Memorable Treats,CD case was pretty well worn on the outside...I was using it for a gift...not quite up to standard.
2,Will Not Work in a Real Original Buttoneer,"Searched & read & tried to see pictures of construction of the refills to make sure these ""originals"" would work in our ""original"" buttoneer. They don't, but we had no way of knowing that the whole insertion mechanism of the Buttoneer had changed so much and was still being called ""original."" I'm sure there is nothing wrong with the refills, but we can';t use them in our 30+ year old Buttoneer."
3,Not as good as the origional one but...,"This new style works as it should, but the nylon ""threads"" don't seem as sturdy as the old ones. Time will tell."
2,Non Button fixer,"instructions a little weak. trial and error to get it to work.will not work when attaching buttons to heavier material, shorts, jeans. works OK on shirts"
2,BUTTONEER shoddy manufacturing,I revived some of the refills that will not fit down into the needle and 1 BUTTONEER that one of the needles came off & bent the first time I tried to use it. It is no good on thicker material. I gave up on putting buttons on the waist line of pants to hold suspenders & am using needle & thread.
1,"The Word ""Original"" should mean original","I bought these because I have an original Buttoneer--a REAL original from the late 60s, and I was looking for refills for it. As it turns out, in the intervening years somebody co-opted the device and came out with a piece of garbage they fraudulently decided to name ""The Original Buttoneer,"" which I understand from other reviews does not work and is a waste of money. I got suckered into buying these refills because hey- they were supposed to be for The Original Buttoneer. So it's probably not these people's fault, but the fault of the people who gave the other gizmo the name ""The Original Buttoneer."" It was a waste of my money. I wish they would just come out with the actual original--which worked wonderfully--and some refills for it. Until then, don't bother."
5,These are even better than the original ones.,With these new oines you just have the clear plastics so all you can see is the color of the button. Much nicer than the originals.
4,They look identical to me,"I've had a Buttoneer for several years, the fasteners are the type that come two to a strip. It works well, I've been very happy with the results. In spite of the negative reviews, I decided to buy these refills. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived to see that they are exactly the same as the originals. I have no reason to expect they will not work just as well."
1,Lousy lousy lousy,"Contentwise, I won't toss darts OR roses. This is genre stuff. You either like it or you don't. My beef is with the technical quality. It is execrable. (1) It is NOT in widescreen (Cinemascope), which it ought to be for a biblical spectacular. There is simply no excuse for cranking out a full-screen treatment in a DVD issued in the year 2000. (2) The so-called ""digital remastering"" must be kitchen-table grade, because the shapes are fuzzy, colors oversaturated, visuals mushy. This DVD should be withdrawn from the market and a new widescreen version substituted. I get better quality from my VHS of this movie than the DVD I purchased. Lousy lousy lousy, as I said."
2,Poor source material and non-letter box format sours,"I've been waiting for years to see this film, shot by Mario Bava before he broke into directing, in letterbox format. Prior to this DVD, the film has only been available on a grainy (16mm source) VHS tape from Sinister Cinema and a much crisper and cleaner tape from 20th century. The MAJOR dissapointment here is that the film is not letterboxed (it was originally shot 2.35:1). The print quality is better than the Sinister Cinema, but remains dark, grainy and sometimes badly framed. Random chapter titles. Let's do this one right, somebody, please."
2,Not the best Quality !,"If you expect a DVD quality , please don't . The sound its not the best either, but you still can hear it , is not been remastered since it was released I believe. The good thing about this movie is in Full screen format. Until a better comes out ( if it does) this is a ""good"" option !!"
4,"great movie, bad dvd case","the dvd ordered came in less than a week which was great. i love this movie, glad i was able to find it at such a crazy cheap price, except the case was all bent up. glad it didnt mess up the dvd."
3,Esther and the King,It was ok.I saw part of it on t.v. and wanted to know how the movie was I can only say it was just o.k.
3,Not exactly as advertised,"I bought this to power a Logitech 50mm ipod player on a solar system. The player needs 12 volts. However, when this product is set to the 12 volt position, the voltage output runs from 12 volts to 14.25 volts. The 12 volt position basically by-passes the electronics inside. The 9 volt position does put out 9 volts , even with 14 volt input. Glad I tested it with a volt meter before I hooked up the ipod player!!"
4,Great wedding band,"I purchased this wedding band for my husband in 2009. He was a shop supervisor at the time and I wanted something durable but also atrractive, and not flashy. Two and a half years later he still loves his ring, and still looks great."
1,Poor quality,The picture and sound quality is very very poor. It feels like a pirate copy. Do not buy this. Waste of money.
1,someone made this in their basement....,"Too good to be true?!?! yea....it is. I just bought tickets to see Radiohead this summer, so I wanted to have some visual Radiohead material to get pumped for the concert. I purchased this unfortunate release, and also the The Best Of Radiohead (with all the music videos, which ive been extremely happy with). I figured $10 for a long, in depth concert of radiohead...why not?!?! This arrived looking like someone put this together in their basement, which absolutely stinks for me, as I believe I might be the only person left that appreciates some decent packaging and quality in the physical release. Honestly the only reason I gave this a shot was because the cover didnt look half bad....well thats not the cover you get. You get a photoshoped picture of the band. As far as the actual concert, couldnt tell ya, cant open it if i want to return it.... :("
3,Beware,"Radiohead are great live which is the only reason I gave it a decent review. That said, the video and audio quality were terrible. I laughed at first, thinking it was a joke. The set list was good."
4,There's not enough live Radiohead on DVD to go around,"Kudos to those reviews that recognize this performance for what it is. Radiohead at the top of their game not long after their release of Kid-A.If you collect DVDs for their sound and video quality and you sort of like Radiohead, then don't bother.If on the other hand, you love Yorke and crew for the geniuses that they are, then add this to your collection.For me personally, I don't get YouTube on my big screen so I have to take what I can get."
3,POOR video GOOD audio,I look at this purchase as worthwhile because the audio quality is fine. Just consider it a live recording CD.
3,It is what it is...,"It's a bootleg. Plain and simple...a bootleg. Therefore, of course it's not 5.1 surround sound. It's got ok sound and average bootleg quality picture. It also happens to be a real nice performance covering a wide range of songs. If you don't mind inferior, bootleg quality concert footage, then definitely pick this up. If your expecting anything more...avoid it."
1,What Is The Deal,"I can not believe that you can get just about any TV series on DVD but one of the best is only available as a ""best of"" No Thanks. I will not reward incompetence with my money. I would love to see the extras but would rather have the next season on DVD.Shame Shame"
2,"I Agree with Max ""Max""","I can't review this DVD (obviously because it has not yet been released) but why not release the entire six seasons of The Larry Sanders Show? The fans of the show have been waiting years for the release of the DVDs. Larry, PLEASE consider your fans, who love the ENTIRE show and ""not just the best."" Since humor is so subjective anyway, who determines what is ""best""?"
1,Why not the whole series?!?!?!,"I needed to add my voice to the cacophony of discontent.Not only is humor subjective as mentioned by another reviewer but a lot ofthe humor in this show came from the growth, or lack there-of, of thecharacters. If you can't track that then you lose lot of what made the showgreat.Will I buy this? Yes, I am looking forward to seeing the extras, and I hopethere is enough of a response to encourage a complete series release.Now let's talk about a complete series DVD release of ""It's GarryShandling's Show"""
1,This show deserves better.,Add my voice to the list of disgruntled and disappointed fans of this great show. Without question it deserves to be released in its entirety (and in better packaging than Season One).
4,Clever- the right way to do a DVD set,"This is a terrific collection of episodes, deleted scenes and extras. To begin with the show is terrific- witty, well-done, really some wonderful television. The 3 stars- Shandling, Tambor and Torn are really good together- the timing and writing is top notch. The guest stars and supporting cast add depth to the shows. The DVD set is particularly impressive. It is a great set of episodes- some of the best they did- I might have put in others but that is a minor complaint. The extras are great on these 4 discs. Nice set of deleted scenes and current interviews with a whole range of people associated with the show. Most TV box sets are just not this well put together. Someone organized this well and put in extras that are interesting- at least if you like the show. The addition of original material for the DVD set really adds value to the set. Anyone who appreciated the show should really enjoy this set."
5,NO FLIPPING,"Imagine a world where nerds comment on the actual quality of the show they are reviewing rather than what they wish was included. Wouldnt that be nice? Its called ""not just the best of"" for a reason- Its not intended to be a complete series edition (and more specifically because its much better than your average best of package). This is a wonedrful (and sizable) sampling of the greatest show in TV history. Best ensemble, best writing, best acting and a truly progressive concept that held its peak from the first episode to the last."
2,Why not the WHOLE series?,"Anybody else angry about this? In an interview in the New York Times Gary Shandling said how he's been working for years on revisiting the Larry Sanders Show. So he tracked down many cast members and guests for their thoughts. The project seems like a real labor of love.So what do we get? Eight hours of ""extras,"" including a lot of ""self-reflection"" on the meaning behind/influence of the show...but only 23 episodes!Memo to Mr. Shandling: you created one of the funniest, most clever shows on television. But we really don't need to be subjected to your personal catharsis.I MIGHT watch the extras once, if at all. I would have prefered the rest of the series, but alas, this collection seems to be it."
2,I agree,"I totally agree with the former writers here. Please, dear studio/Larry/Garry, give us the whole shebang, It's only 5 more seasons"
2,Another call for the whole series,"""The Larry Sanders Show"" is one of the finest, funniest, most insightful TV series in the history of the medium. I don't understand why it is being treated so shabbily. I bought the complete Season One the day it became available and have been waiting for the complete Season Two for years. Fans should not have to settle for a ""Best Of,"" regardless of how many extras it contains."
1,really sad,I'm a huge fan of the show and I'll never buy this. The suits in hollywood have outdone themselves with their chintzy decision to release this best of - rather than season by season. Pathetic.
1,Someone got up on the wrong side of the Bed,"The worst TV shows ever made are out now on DVD as full individual seasons. This release is ill conceived. So ""Not Just the Beast,"" then ""Not Just the Best Two,."" and maybe then ""A little more of maybe not better than the last non Best release?""So you can buy every season of REBA but not every season of Larry??? What's that about???How would you ever get the full series..and in some random order? Yes these are great shows but what were they thinking???"
5,Just as funny the second time around,"The ""Larry Sanders Show"" was ground-breaking for its time and launched the careers of so many younger actors like Jeremy Piven, Janeane Garofolo and even Jon Stewart. It is hysterically funny to watch again. I never tire of Hank and his ""Hey now!"""
3,Below average production quality and not as funny as I remember,"I recalled the laughs I got from the Larry Sanders Show when it originally aired and looked forward to this DVD. As mentioned in other reviews, the picture quality is unexplainably poor, but it doesn't detract too much from the viewing experience. However, I found quite a few of the shows to be not nearly as funny as I recall; in fact some episodes are real duds. The selected episodes in my opinion don't reflect the best the show had to offer. Some of the special features are interesting, such as the breakfast with Sharon Stone. But, by and large, this DVD is a bit disappointing."
1,It's not fair!,"We want all of Larry Sanders, from beginning to end! Not a sop like this. We can't even see it on the tv in the UK - whole generations of people missing out on one of the best comedies there's been so far.Big disappointment..."
1,I Guess I'll Throw My Hat In Too...,"I just want it to be clear that those, like me, who have been waiting for this excellent show to be released in its entirety feel slighted that they choose some random shows and put it on a DVD and then call it good. It appears they have all the extras one could hope for in a DVD, but I can't help but feel insulted by the meager offering of the actual show. I may break down and buy it anyways, but I can't stress enough how important it is that they begin releasing all the seasons, all the episodes, once and for all."
4,"Get a Brain, HBO!","Why is it that HBO will put out every horrible piece of crap out straight away from their current roster of original programming (I'm looking at you, Deadwood and Entourage), but they can't rescue some of the classics from 'the vault'. They're worse than Disney! C'mon now, release the entire damned buggering seasons of Sanders! A best of is a nice fix for the time being, but it doesn't remedy the fact that there are apparently a lot of us out there who love the show. Do we have to wait for A&E to do the right thing like they did with 'Kids In The Hall'? Comedy fans the world over are waiting for more Sanders, not goddamned 'Big Love', all right?"
5,unbelievable extras; great dvd,"Some people gave this dvd a bad review, but only because they're mad that the entire seasons aren't being released. I'm upset too-- but as far as rating this dvd individually goes, it's awesome. Garry shows sides of himself in the extras that he never shows publicly. Of course, all the episodes are incredible because this is one of the best shows ever."
4,If you like comedy...,"If you like comedy you have to get this dvd. This show is the precursor to tv shows like ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""Arrested Development"". It is the behind the scenes look at an insecure talk-show host. A must get for any fans of Garry Shandlings and if you are not a fan- you don't appreciate comedy."
2,"Oh, the inhumanity!","I agree with R Wilson of Baton Rouge. Characters develop throughout the whole series and references and in-jokes are lost if we are forced to watch random episodes.I'll buy this hotch-potch, but with gritted teeth. I'll buy it because I think TLSS was the best ever comedy show - better even than Bilko and Seinfeld - and that's saying something."
3,This is a work of FICTION just in case it's not clear,"It's quite well written and stories are great. But if you do any research on the internet, you will find out this is a work of FICTION.So as long as you know this is a work of fiction. I am not sure why the author made it sound like it's based on someone's true life. It is not.S"
4,"A great piece of fiction, unfortunately presented as fact","a wonderful fun read that I strongly recommend, however do not be misled by the claim that this book is history - it is historical fiction, the first part of a ripping trilogy, unfortunately out of print. It is a shame that the author mars this with the patently false claim of authenticity. The first two volumes of the trilogy are excellent, however the third falls way down - who would believe that a master of chinese martial arts would have such difficulty learning boxing?"
3,"""Use the Tao""","A friend recommended this book to me; in retrospect, his intent was clear. Like the Bhagavad Gita, Deng Ming Dao's The Wandering Taoist emphasizes the necessity to cut all worldly ties, however strong, however steeped in tradition, however ""right"" and ""just"" those ties may appear. For in the final analysis, we are all here to learn life's lessons, face them squarely, and move on to better things - in this life or the next.Like the Don Juan novels of Carlos Castenada, a series of logically impossible phenomena and events are recounted that take place on the edge of our knowledges. Unlike those novels, The Wandering Taoist presents a very evocative and informative picture of Taoism. While the first few chapters may be slow-going, the book ""reads itself"" quickly.Recommended for anyone interested in Taoism."
4,Best in it's 3 part series!,"It is advisable to try to find the three books series, as the ""Chronicles"" is abridged, and some of the most interesting martial arts information was left out. A very interesting piece regarding all the varied martial arts training at the turn of the last century on Hua Shan(mountain), and describes the interaction between the various Buddhist and Taoist temples, in sharing/exchanging martial arts knowledge and training. Would perhaps make a great movie screen play."
5,Indispensible,"Lotions, Potions, and Deadly Elixirs is an indispensible desk reference for anyone who writes the West. Not only is it a side-splitting pleasure to read, the book is chock full of information on every conceivable cure, poison, and snake-medicine ever sold or bought on the American frontier. Highly recommended."
5,Best of the lot,"Of the several books I ordered on the subject of the medicine shows and related topics. Gives very good information on what was used back then. What effects it had good or bad, and if it is still in use today. Also contains many short stories on frontier doctors. A good read. Book is in brand new condition. Great buy for the money."
5,great for a quick meal,"My kids are vegetarian. I just cook up some pasta (Barilla Plus), sauté a variety of vegetables, add some Field Roast brand vegetarian sausage, and mix it all together with Mayacamas Spicy Skillet Pasta Toss. It's quick, nutritious, and tasty, even if you aren't a vegetarian."
4,The perfect companion for journaling!,"Eldonna Bouton has packed a punch with this booklet on how to write and keep a journal! In the booklet's 32 pages, she has included 20 different journaling methods; prompts to get you started; and the ""rules"" of journaling (of which there are none!) If you have always wanted to keep a journal but didn't know where to start, Bouton's ""Write Away"" is the perfect beginning for you! Enjoy!"
5,Very good!,"Heartfelt, inspiring songs. I loved it since I first heard it. Very innovative approach to the typical Latin ballads. Some upbeat songs as well. The album has one song in English (a bit more rocking) and one in French, the rest in Spanish. It includes two new songs by Celia Recinos, one of Guatemala's most famous artists, who is also a wonderful songwriter. The rest of the songs are by Giovanni himself. Very good!"
5,love these speakers!!!!!!!!! better than bose 2,I have to say I love these speakers!!!! The sound is great. I tried every speaker system without a big subwoofer and these sounded the best!!!! Actually bought the bose 2 companion and returned them. Everybody that hears them says the same thing. The speakers are loud and have a nice crisp sound. The best 2.0 speaker system out there!!!
4,NICE SPEAKERS AT LOWER PRICE,"These speakers look nice and produce quality sound, if not powerful. You are going have connect some other way if you have quality sound card. The software for the LCD is fine, however, the email doesn't connect to server very well or is too slow, so I disabled it. These speakers are good for using on a computer which they are intended for. The price is reasonable on Amazon, but $149 is somewhat overpriced. These speakers aren't powerful enough for $149 even with interactive display. I will recommend these speakers purchased at a lower price. Also don't worry about the finger prints,they wipe off. Please! that's too picky."
5,Excellent speakers,"Definitely a nice pair of speakers for those who don't have space for a subwoofer or just want a unique look and great sound. These speakers have very nice bass for their size and the lcd screen and touch buttons are actually pretty useful for listening to music without directly using your PC. I haven't had any problems with unresponsive controls at all, it just takes the right touch/brush movement that you learn within a few hours of actually using the speakers. I only wish they were completely compatible with more music players, so far I haven't been able to get winamp to work with the pause and skip buttons so I've had to resort to windows media player when I want to use those functions.Overall I'd definitely recommend these speakers for anyone willing to shell out the bucks. Based on sound alone, this the best 2.0 system I've owned and it looks good and works flawlessly to boot."
3,"Pretty, nice build, very crisp but odd sound","I bought these because the reviews in general were quite good (on the UK Amazon at least). And having had them, I can relate to most of the reviews - the sounds is very crisp and the look is very pretty and the build quality seems great. However, there is something weird about every song I play. Something is definitely missing in the range, or the way the music is synthesized, but I'm not an expert so I can't tell you what in particular. Another reviewer summed it up well - the sound is a bit ""unreal"". The LCD display, works nicely, but a cheap gimmick in mind. I'd prefer these speakers with a fat volume knob and more of that beautiful black substance covering the lcd screen.I don't know if I would risk the purchase, cos the sound is really crisp and it does look good, but the sound it produces might not be to your taste so I wouldn't risk it."
2,"Lose balance, unreal sound, disappointed","Unable to find a satisfied balance of the bass & treble for this speaker. I've tried all the way, different combinations, but still failed to hear the sense I want. What I can conclude here now, is this speaker produces bad quality of sound, pretty much unbalanced, some frequences are overstated, some get lost, the human sound of a song from this speaker is really badly badly silly tiny, feeling covered by the background music in most cases.This speaker is definitely NOT the one having pleasing sound and will make you losing interest to hear it again. The sound can be said tiresome...Do I have to spend more money if I want to get one with rich frequence and balanced sound???"
2,So-so,"The sound quality on these speakers is not the greatest. Also, the touch-sensitive controls did not function properly (or at all) with my computer. I called Logitech customer support (which is not open 24/7) a couple times when I owned these speakers and they were not very helpful at all. If you want good looking speakers but don't care how they sound and want to take a chance on whether or not the touch-sensitive controls will work with your computer set-up, then by all means these are the speakers for you. Personally, I returned them and purchased the Logitech Z-4 speakers which turned out to sound A LOT better and look pretty cool as well. The Z-4 has a seperate sub woofer so the sound is a lot richer."
2,Impressive appearance but that's all,"Having purchased these a month ago, I have come to regret it. Mind you the price on Amazon is $50 to $60 cheaper than the stores, the sound quality is choppy which may entail a defect. In addition, the ease of use of the controls is far from what you should expect of its touch sensitive platform. Sometimes, I need to push onto where the ""buttons"" are located to try to adjust any levels. Of course, they look very impressive but that's all it is. In addition, on a average desktop surface, they occupy a lot of space which in these days there are better alternatives that produce a better sound and take up less space. Hence, these speakers are far from what I expected."
5,Audio engineer review,"I just opened the box and turned them on, and they are truly awesome. True, the speakers have some noise you can hear when no music is playing, but the audio quality is great, the touch controls are cool, and they are REALLY well made, HEAVY SPEAKERS, THICK THICK THICK cords! YAY, they won't short out like my crappy harmon/kardons. Great stereo imaging. Killer price, too. Hey, I can't believe the bass is so good without a woofer. I can't stop touching them."
4,An excellent read... More Random Thoughts from Larry Niven's Brain...,"I was delighted to get my hands on Scatterbrain, as I've enjoyed previous ""Random Thoughts from Larry Niven's Brain"" books in the past. It marries excerpts and short stories with information on the writing process, stories from SciFi Cons, etc. It was well worth what I paid for it, and only continues to confirm why Mr. Niven is one of the TOP hard science SciFi writers of our time."
5,A #1!,"This, seriously, is the best deal around in home theater speakers.I bought mine when I began setting up my personal system last year. An AMAZING value! If you don't have a monster amplifier (over say, 200 watts) this is the one to get.Meant (ideally) for small living rooms or similar rooms, these sound GREAT. AND the subwoofer alone is worth the entire cost of the system, at LEAST.I hooked mine up with Monster Cable THX speaker wire, and the subwoofer with a THX cable, all to my Yamaha 110 watt amplifier. Set the amp on ""SMALL ROOM"", and it makes the room literally come alive with sparkling surround sound!! (Unfortunately, the speaker wire and cables that come with it are junk. Don't even bother. BUT if you invest in some good wire and cables it REALLY makes a difference!)Easy on the pocketbook. Not to be denied.ENJOY!"
4,very good,"Table of contents includes: Awesome power of myth, hero and evil one, the journey begins; death, rebirth and the confrontation with the evil one, the hero returns, tragic heroes/comic heroes. There are many books out now on this subject- adaptingThe Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell)to a template. This is NOT formula writing, this is far more flexible than that. The mythic structure is the basis of all successful movies and stories, though no one story has all 22 elements. Of course all myths follow mythic structure also.The Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers, 3rd Editionis another book that covers the same material. This is a good guidebook, to conforming a story to mythic structure. I liked it enough to send it to my wife's sister, who wants to write a novel."
2,Hit and myth,"Joseph Campbell wrote ""The Hero With 1000 Faces,"" arguably one of the most influential books of the 20th century.Christopher Vogler wrote ""The Writer's Journey,"" which might have been renamed ""The Hero With 1000 Faces For Dummies.""Now James Frey has written ""The Key,"" which might be renamed ""The Writer's Journey For Dummies.""The only thing you will find in this book that is not in the previous books is countless directions to read Frey's ""How To Write A Damn Good Novel,"" and other ""Damn Good"" books.Do yourself a favour and read Campbell and Vogler instead."
3,Already been done,"The book is basically a rehash of Christopher Vogler's classic ""The Writer's Journey."" Frey's book covers exactly the same concept, however, his focus is more basic and directed toward novelists versus screenwriters. (If you read Vogler's book, and you're a novelist, you'll do just as well if not better.)I might have liked this book more if I hadn't read Vogler's first which covers the concept much more comprehensively. One reviewer noted he's using Frey's book as a 'template' rather than a 'guideline.' Fine, if your goal is cookie-cutter fiction. (Vogler's book specifically warns against using mythic concepts in this way.)If you want a simple introduction to myth-as-story, this book will do. (In fact, the entire book is summarized in a single chapter toward the end. If you must have it, borrow the book from the library and photocopy the chapter.) But if you really want to fully explore the potential mythic structure has to offer, this book comes up a bit short."
5,Buy this book,"Of all the writing resources available, there used to be one that I said no writer could be without -- Make Your Words Work by Gary Provost. Now I have to revise that. For fiction writers particularly, now that are two books not to be without. The Key is a must."
2,"Not worth it, very small!","The pieces are made of cardboard, not wood, as I had expected. I wouldn't purchase this again. Expensive for what is is worth!"
3,Beware Diverticulitics,"Not bad for a healthy little snack. Good burst of raspberry and yogurt flavor. Smaller than other bars and a bit too compressed for my liking, but still good. The compressed aspect makes it less chewy and fluffy than other bars I like. On the expensive side. Also, the bar is a bit too seedy in texture - so if you have tics, don't buy these. Otherwise, go for it."
5,"Efectividad, Alegría y Virtud en el trabajo y la vida","Los tres tomos de Metamanegement han sido una gran inspiración para mí, me han ayudado a comprender que era posible desarrollarme en lo profesional sin dejar de darle importancia a la calidad de vida. Me han servido para lograr mejores resultados de negocios, lidiar con problemas de índole comunicativo que me limitaban en las interacciones en el ambito laboral y para repsonsabilizarme con alegría: tomando decisiones de una manera inteligente y apasionada, ligada a desafíos personales, de equipo y hasta organizacionales. La lectura de estos tomos es recomendale para todo aquel que desee que los negocios y la vida sean no sólo de éxito, sino además, de alegria y virtud."

3,For a friend!,"I ordered 7 of these books for a friend who need some help and a credit card. She traded for several of hours of help cleaning and organizing. Unfortunately, I ended up paying more in shipping and handling that I did for the books. They weren't sent literautre using book rate. I haven't read the book but she may give me one as a gift and then I will read it. The author and her have the same last name and she loved the book. She loves to give small gifts like this."
1,Man of faith? guess it depends on how you look at it,"...but in reality he was just another evangelical hypocritical racist typical in the 19th century. There is nothing so special about this man that he should be so exalted as some great Christian, for his underlying ideology was as dogmatic as it was bigoted. For example he says, famously, ""human hate is a deadly blight that does worse damage to the hater than to the hated"". But then, in another text, he states: ""Humanity must not, cannot, allow the incompetence, negligence, and laziness of the uncivilized peoples to leave idle indefinitely the wealth which God has confided to them"". Really? If you can read this man's own words and still think he was some great champion of faith who embodied the life of Christ, you probably agree with the latter statement, in spite of the former... to which I can only say, to quote this ""man of miracles"" yet again: ""hate in your heart will consume you too""."
5,Great book & resource!,I just looked at this book while attending a national conference on child development. This would make a great gift for new or expectant parents. It is well wriiten and very easy to follow.
2,Overall...unimpressed,"Having lived in Norway for nearly two years now with my Norwegian husband, I've been picking up on the language. I wanted a book to help me make the transition from 'observer' to 'participant'. It was a mistake to think this might be the book to do that.Aside from the errors in the text and occasionally ambiguous translations, the thing that immediately caught my (and my husband's) attention was the mismatch in the dialects spoken by the characters and where they are supposed to be from. If you're trying to learn Norwegian as spoken in Norway (as opposed to Norwegian spoken elsewhere in the world), correctly identifying dialects with their proper locations is extremely important.I've put this book away on a shelf and am again looking for a lesson book. Count me sorely disappointed."
1,Has many errors,"While the set up of this book is great, it unfortunately contains many typos and errors, in both the English and the Norwegian text. I used this book in addition to another one to learn the language for a few months before moving to Norway. When I finally started formal classes here and we started covering the material I learned through ""Beginner's Norwegian"", I found that the book was wrong. I hope the author sits down with the editor and puts out a revision soon."
1,Beginner's Norwegian????,Far to few phrase's and a very small dictionary. Not for someone visiting Norway for a few weeks who just needs the basics.
4,Price,"Price was much better than would have paid in stores, Sony still proud of there batteries. It would be nice if they also offered a larger capacity battery!"
4,Sony's InfoLithium Battery for DSC-HX1,"This ""new"" battery of Sony's is a bit smaller than for the Sony DSLR series. However, it still maintains enough power to see me through most of day's worth of shooting. That's using the LCD screen, zoom, some video shooting, and reviewing/deleting. I always carry a spare, fully charged battery for the inevitable ""emergency"". It's well worth the cost for reliability, size, and quality."
3,NOT a NPFM50 Replacement,"When searching for a replacement battery, Amazon leads you to believe that the NP FH 50 is a replacement for the NP FM 50. This battery will NOT replace your NPFM50; it does NOT fit in my Sony DSC-S70 despite claiming to be comparable.Now to deal with an annoying return, plus 4 days lost.No knock against the battery or the retailer, just don't do what I did.Andrew."
5,As Advertised,"i bought this as a second battery for my sony alpha dslr camera. It arrived as advertised in original packaging.The item was 40% cheaper on Amazon that at Best Buy, and it arrived within 3 days due to the proximity of the warehouse where I live even though it shipped for free."
5,Great deal on an OEM product!,Bought this Sony battery for my wife's new sony digital slr camera and it was a fraction of the price of what Sonystyle and our local Best Buy store was asking. Received it very promptly before we left for vacation and took A LOT of pictures and the battery worked perfect. Could not ask for a better deal anywhere!
1,Sony Battery,"Was told this would work in a Sony 230a camera but does not. Don't know what battery life is because I never got it to work. Thought that buying the Sony brand name would be best. Guess not. Still possible the camera is reading wrong, but have tried several times with no success."
5,Lasting up to 500 shots.,"Depending on the subject that your shooting, and how often you turn the camera on and off between shots, having the camera do a cleaning each time it's shut off makes the big difference. If you shoot shots one by one, it will last 200-250 shots, and if you shoot all at once, non-stop, not turning the camera off after each shot, it will stretch to about 500."
5,Works as expected,What can I say... the battery works as expected. It charges up as expected and the battery life-time is as expected.
4,Amateur User,The product was same as it was described and shipment was really very quick. I am happy with price and quality and recommend others to buy it.
5,Great Buy!!!,"Needed an extra battery seeing as I take almost as many video as I do pictures. For the price in stores, I could wait. But from amazon, I totally had to jump on the sale. Now I can photograpgh all day long"
1,This doesn't work for Sony DCR-DVD103,"I got this battery couple of months ago for Sony DCR-DVD103. When I charged it and inserted in to the camera , there appeared a flash message saying , "" insert info lithium battery "" and then the screen went blank . Tried it again , it was the same result !! This battery doesn't work for Sony DCR-DVD103 !! I mailed to the guy about it one week ago and he didn't reply yet ..."
1,Battery did not work on my a380,"I keep getting this message..""incompitable battery . use correct model""I thought the battery is original Sony battery but turned out it is not!!I bought it from ""DependableResource""Be carefulUpdate 5/21/2011.. I contacted amazon, and thankfully they made a refund for the whole amount. I am very glad with their service."
5,Fantastic,This is an original Sony battery. I bought the latest Sony camera DSCHX200V camera from Dubai and wanted an extra battery. Have been trying for the last two months since I have made the purchase from Jumbo electronics in Dubai. Finally I could order it online from amazon and it arrived in good shape and works well. Thanks amazon for obtaining products when it is not available at Sony Dubai also. Would highly recommend it.
3,"Too small, too weak","I bought both the NPFH50 and 70 in addition to the 60 model which comes standard with the HDR XR 500 Sony cam in Switzerland. While the 60's and 70's provide adequate battery life, the 50 is not performing enough for this cam and its use should be dicouraged. The flip side of the coin is the fair value for money, as twice the stamina costs you twice the dollars. By the way, Sony original batteries are 2 to 3 times cheaper in the US than in Europe. Only God (or Sony's marketing depertment) knows why..."
3,not satisfied with battery,"The battery works fine in my camcorder, which is fine since I could not find one to buy..BUT I thought it would be a rechargeable stye, so not exactly what I had hoped for...Amazon is a terrific site and most of my purchases have been great."
1,Not a Sony FPFh 50 battery.,Sent a Sony NP FP 50 battery instead of the NP FH 50 battery.The H series batteries can be used on P series camcorder but not the other way round.Emailed them but recieved no reply.Nice Sony camcorder softsided case with three blank disk included.Did not want to spend any more money to get what I bought already.
3,Suave Mousse,Not what was pictured. Could have got it anywhere.Was looking for what was pictured which has been discontinued.Will work fine though.
4,Definitely Helpful In Canada,"We found this book to be very helpful in picking an Indian name for our Canadian-born baby. The organisation takes some getting used to -- the names are not in alphabetical order, but rather, are organised based on the number of letters in the name. Once you're used to the style, it makes a lot of sense -- the authors feel that really long names (more than 10 letters and/or four syllables) aren't easily pronounced by English-speaking North Americans, and they're right. So, the names at the start of each letter -- the short ones -- are your best bets. They also make an effort to mark names that are easily pronounced in English, as well as those that might result in especially bad pronounciation.Although I'm sure this book has its faults in terms of name meanings, it certainly is a great way to find an English-friendly baby name. I've yet to find a name on any Indian Baby Names website that wasn't in this book."
3,Great history lesson,I thought it fell short on speaking about any of the Martial Artist from the Midwest like the famous The Baker Brothers(Master Preston Baker or Master Otis Baker) or Master Jimmy Jones or Master Shorty Mills or Master Tola Naa to name a few...
5,"Wonderful, Colorful Book...",Todd Parr books are so colorful and have great messages attached to them. This book does not disappoint. The pictures are simple and vibrant which really caught my daughter's attention. The message attached is great because it shows diversity among mothers. I recommend all of his books.
5,LOVE Todd Parr,"I've been giving Todd Parr's books as gift for over 10 years now and am finally so happy to share them with my own little girl. The colorful pictures, the simple and funny text and the sensitivity to all of the differences we have in our lives are just a few of the reasons I love his books. My friends have been telling me for years that their children love the books we gave them, and now I can say the same is true for my own as well. You will want his entire collection after reading just one!!!"
4,Great book!,I love Todd Parr's books! They are short & simple & easy for preschool kids to understand & relate to.
3,Catz,"This game is helpful for a younger person wanting a cat. It's campy fun for an older person as well.The player character is either a grade school boy or girl(you choose).Positive points:-It shows what must be done day to day in caring for a ""low maintenance"" pet; such as a cat.-There are many breeds to own as you progress in the game.Negative points:-You can only keep your pet 14 game days.-There are no ""extras"" such as games.-No accessories like collars, furniture, or music.-There is also this annoying purple haired girl to check on your progress. She even threatens to take your cat away if you don't care for it. The parents in the game even are scared of this twerpy girl. My son termed her the Kitty Protection Services Polizei. This is the most annoying aspect of the game."
2,not nearly as fun as pocket dogs,"kids did not fight over this game like pocket dogs. in fact, i bought it to alleviate the fighting over pocket dogs and my girls like cats better than dogs but...they seemed to care less about the game and then ""lost"" it in the back seat of dad's car. when i asked them if they ever found it they said that they didn't care to because no one liked it!girls are 7, 9 (and 3 years but she is not really a customer)"
3,its cute,"this is the cutest game ever...lol...the only thing is is that i found out you have to keep repeating the game to unlock other catz that you can use in the game...theres not all that much to do in the game with the cat but feed and play with it...not all too exciting...i deffiantly recommend this for younger girls that want the responsiblity for an animal because it does teach responsiblity for an animal, although in a gaming form...its like a tomagotci toy in a way...all in all its cute i do like it..."
1,BoooOOOOOORIIIiiiinnng!,"monotonous repetition monotonous repetition monotontous repetition.When you ""play"" with your pet, it swipes at the toy in exactly the same way every time- for about two seconds. There is no dynamic action in this game. Why a child or anyone else would find this entertaining is beyond me.My five year old girl said it was ""stupid"" and doesn't bother to play it. This is nothing but a glorified Tamagotchi. Monotonous repetition of the same actions. Don't be fooled, its not like your child will be interacting with a cyber pet."
3,Maybe...,"I ordered this game for my 10 year old son who is obsessed with cats. He ""beat"" it in a couple days and gave up on it. I looked online and read that he could unlock other cat breeds. This renewed his interest, but not for long. I have just read that after completing the game multiple times, it allows you to keep your beloved pet for a longer duration. I will suggest this and see if this game can redeem itself from the poor interaction and dated graphics."
4,"Great, and awesome","I absoulutley love it. although it bothers me that they leave you at so young. it is a really good game, though. The cats are just TO CUTE! LOL"
1,worst game ever,there is a lot of reading when you first start the game and it seems like the reading never ends. this is nothing like the dog game. my daughter won't play it because of all the reading takes so long.
2,My review on catz,"I got this game thinking it would be fun.WRONGEHear are the bad things in the game1. There is this Mean girl who cheacks up on yur cat and threatens to take your cat away(and why dose she care about how I'M rasing MY CAT)2. You parents aculey think this girl is doing a good thing3.You can only go in 3 rooms(living room,bedroom, and outside)4. you don't see your charictor( except at night but you only see your purple hair in bed)5.you can only keep your cat for 14 days6. no mini gamesthis game would be better if they'd jest get the evil girl out of the pictureWell thats my review i hope you like reading it"
1,CUTE but not worth $30,"I bought this game for my 6 year old daughter. She loves it, although if I knew it didn't have the mini games like the dogz game does, I woudn't have bought this one. She loves this one though, I guess that's all that counts, especially since she's so picky about video games. I also ordered Pocket Dogs which has a really good review. Wait till the price drops, or look into one that has the mini games as well."
2,"The good, the bad and the equivocal...all rolled into one!","I found this book to be informative and entertaining but also somewhat disturbing. There seems to be a tendency to overemphasize so-called ""alternative"" therapy, and the information is presented in such a way as to cajole the unwary reader into thinking that mainstream and alternative treatments are equivalent. Curiously, neither of the authors is a physician, and the book hardly mentions the existence of the ""rheumatologist"",i.e.,the physician who specializes in diagnosis and treatment of rheumatic diseases. I found this surprising at best, and also a bit offensive. It was clear that this is not a completely objective or balanced guide to arthritis and its management."
1,I resent this,"This book is an insult. I am a dummy by no one's estimation. However, I have two different forms of arthritis. I developed them without ever reading a word on the topic, as I'm sure many arthritis sufferes have. That there would be a book offering instructions on getting arthritis for the feeble minded is an insult to all the noises I make getting out of low chairs!!"
5,Works as Advertised,This Backing Flange is designed for placing other types of blades on a small DeWalt angle grinder. It works well for its intended purpose.
1,Secret History?,"As a Latin student in high school I knew most of what the author has to say about gladiators, so what kind of ""Secret History"" can this be?I agree with previous reviewers that the writing, organization, and production of the book are poor. Much of the book rambles onto subjects that are related primarily by being Roman.The chapter on a day at the circus starts with a gratuitous piece of sexual sadism and continues with gore, cruelty, and bloodlust. Lurid is too pale a term.If you know nothing about gladiators and want to learn, find a different book."
4,Very Exciting and Well Written,"This little book contains a lot of interesting information on the gladiators of ancient Rome and is written in a style that makes it very difficult to put down. In describing the life of the Roman gladiator, the author includes, along the way, snipets of information and digressions on various related issues, including mini-biographies of noteworthy personages such as Spartacus and certain Roman emperors. Rather than detracting from the book's main focus, that is, gladiatorial games, these snipets complement the book such that the reader acquires a more complete picture of the epoch in which these cruel games were taking place. All that is missing is a suitable collection of pictures illustrating the various gladiator types, their equipment and the arenas in which they fought. Nevertheless, a highly recommended book."
2,Not Terrible?,"Well, though I'm hardly a scholar on this subject, I really expected to get a lot more out of reading this book. It showes some promise early on, but then degenerates into a sort of re-hash of what I'd consider commonly-known facts about Rome's ancient vice. The author tries WAY too hard to try to paint the various arena games of the Romans in a semi-positive light by explaining that their culture was different than the modern day western world, but he positively hammers this point again and again. Also, the last quarter of the book is nothing but trite. I really can't recommend this. Though the author is obviously an expert, and has done his homework, there's really nothing in this book that makes one want to continue turning the pages."
2,Amateurish,"This book reads like an undergrad paper; it is short, repetitive, and derivative, and the author obviously isn't an expert in classics, or military history, or archaeology, or anything that might apply to the topic. He isn't a very good writer, either. Or maybe he just had a poor editor.This might be good for kids, or for people who know nothing about the ancient world, but I suspect they will be a little disapppointed by the total lack of illustrations; there are no artist's renderings of a gladiator's armor and weapons, no reproductions of ancient paintings or mosaics, and no photos or maps of Rome, an amphitheatre, or anything. If you are interested in gladiators, I suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Awful,"Appallingly poor.Reads like its been written in the back of the school bus on the way to the exam.Very little info on actual Gladiators, it mostly focuses on tabloid style shock stories and continuously tells the reader how ""bad"" these things are (like we need to be told).This book is divided into chapters, the names of which have little bearing on the actual contents of the chapters and has the most god-awful repetitive and disjointed flow I've seen in a book quite a while, random thoughts and stories put down with no coherent plan.The Author also refuses to give any sources on anything and so when he tells his stories you'll just have to take it as gospel.Do not get this ""book""."
2,Disappointed,"I am sorry but I have to disagree with the other reviews of this book. I found it incredibly lacking as even an introductory book. The book had lots of tidbits of history but I found even those to be questionable on occasion. The book lists the tools, rituals, a very vague description of sabbats without really explaining why we use or do any of these things. Unfortunately, I wouldn't dream of recommending this book to any of my students unless it was to share the lovely pictures. I would be quicker to recommend books by Scott Cunningham, the Farrars, Buckland first."
4,well its like this,this book is great because it explains pretty much all the basics rolled into one it doesnt go very deep into many subjects and i found it a little fluffy but not a bad buy
5,When God Created Lebanon.... May 1999.,"On the seventh day God rested and slept. In a dream he saw what was missing, a place absolute artistry which would be haven for him and those who appreciated the mysteries. He woke up early the next morning and proceeded to toy with his artistic ideas. And there was Lebanon. A symphony, written early at the dawn of time, carved by a lover-God a gift to all the lovers who would populate this earth. The Authors"
4,Good sanding discs but a little awkward,"My main complaint is that the discs come somewhat warped so they are challenging to fit onto the grinder the first time. Once I flattened them out, they worked great."
4,So-so,"On the eve of Lord Piergeiron's wedding to Lady Eidola of Neverwinter, nothing goes right. Lizardman, doppelgangers, and an assasination attempt are but the least of problems. This story sets the way for the introduction of the Utter East and bloodforges. The Realms date is sometime after the time of troubles."
5,A substantive mystery.,"Chapter I of The Far Side of the Dollar finds veteran PI Lew Archer visiting a reform school for rich teenagers. Young Thomas Hillman a recent admission to the facility has gone AWOL and Archer has been hired by the school's headmaster to find him. A fairly straightforward case, right? Wrong. As in all Ross Macdonald novels, the plot becomes ever increasingly intricate as the narrative unfolds.There's plenty of standard Ross Macdonald fare packed into the pages of this very engaging book. Family dysfunction that spans the generations, hidden blood relationships between characters, a young person's journey to claim a birthright heretofore denied as well as jealousy and greed leading to murder most foul.The ""readability"" of The Far Side of the Dollar is greatly enhanced by its wonderfully insightful descriptive prose. Another very appealling aspect to this novel is the extremely vivid and at times emotionally wrenching way the characters are developed. Highly recommended."
4,"Good, not great mid-sixties MacDonald","Written in MacDonald's most productive period, Far Side of the Dollar is not his masterpiece by far (as a couple of the other reviewers want to think it is).It's solid, and compulsively readable, as usual for MacDonald. It doesn't quite take off into the stratosphere, as his best work does, and there are a couple of niggling plot questions that make you close the book at the end with a slightly sour feeling of discontent (The villain's motive is rather sketchy, very rare for MacDonald, and the motive or behavior of one character who aides the villain is also a little head-scratching). A good MacDonald book, not great."
2,"Classic & nonoffensive, but boring","Boucheron EDP is a much more, what I would call an old-fashioned classic. Boucheron on my skin starts out with a nice dose of jasmine and powdery incense. It's really nice while those top notes last. Then in mach speed it turns dusty smelling then quickly disappears altogether.Surely, Boucheron would never cause offense to anyone because it's a fragrance you would wear to church or to the office. Though that's the very thing I hold against it, a great perfume causes a reaction or envokes a feeling; Boucheron does neither with me! It's a very classic type of scent, but nothing that hasn't been done and redone many times since the 1800s."
3,Not very intense,"I really like Chalene. I own ChaLEAN Extreme and several turbo fire workouts. I am also a Turbo Kick instructor. I had never done Turbo Jam before this workout and I expected high intensity but I was disappointed. The workout is fun and good for beginners and maybe intermediates, but there are much better HIIT workouts than this. I didn't even break a sweat in 30 minutes. I smiled but I need something much more amped up. If you are looking for a easy-to-medium short workout than this is for you but if you want a HIIT workout with real intensity, check out her Turbo Fire HIIT workouts, they are a much better workout."
2,okay workout,I love turbo jam punch kick and jam.....so i got this video and it is a quick workout but it does not seem to be as effective. It is very repetitious. I would spend the extra 15 minutes and do punch kick and jam.
1,Give me Billy and Shaun T. anytime,"I purchased this dvd based on the reviews. I must say that I was very disappointed. The choice of music was very bad and I just could not get going. The next day I leave the dvd by the mail box in my building so that someone could take it, hopefully they enjoyed it."
2,turbo jam fat blaster review,It's a great workout for younger women who are not on beta blockers. I could not do this work out and the low impact option really was not low impact.
1,not a favourite,"I love turbojam...let's get that clear.However, this is my least favorite of the DVD's. I think it is too dancy, a little harder to follow, the music is terrible, and I am distracted by chalene's too short tight shorts that outline body areas that do not need to be! There are MUCH better Turbo Videos' and the newer Turbofire HIIT videos are way way way better!"
1,Not worth the time or money,"Im usually a huge fan of the Instructor and the other Turbo Jam videos. They're usually very detailed, fun & easy to follow. Unfortunately this video did not measure up to the others. The music was awful and at times it didn't seem to flow with the movements. There was little instruction and most of the moves were lacking form and were hard to follow. I found myself bored and watching the clock hoping it would end soon. I would NOT recommend this video although i love the others. Fat Blaster is just not worth the time or money."
5,Nothing But Turbo!,"This one is packed with the Warmup and 4 Turbo's compiled from other Turbo Jam workouts! You do each one in slow/learning mode, and then you repeat it in turbo mode. And, since your going from low impact to high and then back to low then to high, it revs your metabolism. I know that another review said that the que's are terrible, but they are there. Plus, these workouts are meant to be done a few times a week, and since you will learn the routine and get more used to it, you would eventually tune the ques out anyways and just have fun with the work out. I would definately reccomend this one to any one wanting to add to their Turbo Jam collection."
1,Still have not received,I ordered Les Chats de Paris on 4/21/09 and have still not received it as of 5/27/09!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want my money back and I will NEVER order from this dealer again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Beware of this dealer!!!!!!!!
1,Seller is either inept or dishonest,"Home and Beyond continues to advertise these as a 25 pack for short money (as I'm writing this, they're at $2.79 for a 25 pack), but they cancel every order that I place. I can't imagine how they could be so inept, but they continually offer these and other types of discs for this price, and then cancel the orders with the comment ""Reason for refund: Item not satisfactory"". I personally believe that if they can't get their pricing right, Amazon needs to either take them off of the ""featured merchants"" list, or start forcing them to honor the price they list these at. Amazon is known for their stellar customer service, and it reflects poorly on them that one of their featured merchants has a 78% rating and continues to make mistakes in the pricing and description of the products they sell."
2,OK but repetitive and 'sales-spin' top heavy,"Had some nuggets of interest to an architect/developer, but mostly had a manager's perspective. Lots of repetition, lots of java-sell, and not enough quality content to merit a hearty recommendation..."
5,You should buy this book.,"Cattell and Inscore do a very nice job laying out and illustating what J2EE server technology is all about, but more importantly they focus on ""Real World"" implementations of the J2EE compliant products.The book focuses on leaders in the field and award winning J2EE implementations. Each chapter focuses on a particular J2EE application server and implementation. It is a Who's Who of J2EE application servers and companies leading the way in the Java application programming revolution.I was inspired and enjoyed reading each unique chapter."
3,Get what you pay for.,"This blade is OK. It does the job, slowly. I've been cutting stucco. Bosch blades are better. Hilti is triple the price, but does eight times the work."
4,"5 year old likes it ""so and so""","My five year old loves the fact that all the individual magnet parts fall appart in a crash like in ""a real crash"". He's had this toy since he was three years old and he used to play with it a lot more back then. He still has all the part. Encourages creativity."
2,Not as expected,"I am typically a huge Melissa and Doug fan, but I am not impressed with this one. The shapes are really difficult to decipher--both in color and in shape. The beads really do not look much like the picture they are supposed to match, which makes it quite frustrating for the kids (and for me!). I really do not like this puzzle."
2,Bad quality and made of defect,"There is one board with wong color printed. Also the printed shape in the board is hard to recognize. The cover can not cap well. However, my son like it, but he always plays as lollipop and that is the reason why I didn't return it. Anyway, I regreat to buy this."
1,Not acceptable,"Melissa & Doug is usually very high quality, but this falls far short. Not only are there not enough beads to complete some of the sequences, as other reviewers have said, but there are also shapes indicated on the sequence cards that are not included in the set! In addition, we had to carve some of the bases of the sequence strips so that they would fit into the holding slot. Not recommended, unless you want to create your own learning games, as we have had to do."
5,"great toy, great gift","As a teacher and mom of three, I was very happy with this toy. The kids enjoy handling the chunky beads. It can easily be adapted for toddler through kindergarten. I love all the Melissa and Doug toys. They are easy to store away for a rainy day or something special to pull out when the babysitter arrives."
1,Not impressed,"Having purchased many Melissa & Doug products for my son, I did not hestitate to buy this. I was extremly disappointed. The blue & purple beads are so close in color that I cannot tell them apart, let alone my 2 year old! There are not enough beads to complete some of the sequence cards and the shapes are hard to determine. My son still loves to play with the set but as a teaching tool it is useless."
4,"Agree - Great concept, needs refinement","My son seemed to enjoy this item and I love it for the educational aspect. Patterns and sequencing are very important concepts in the early school years and even into the higher elementary grades, patterns/sequences show up in math homework & reading (i.e. sequence of a story). Sequence/pattern questions are also prominent on standardized tests. So this item is a great introduction, however, I agree with the previous reviewer, some beads are very similar making it difficult to discern on the pattern card - even I goofed on the first look. Blue does look too much like the purple and cylinders and squares look too similar on the pattern cards. Also, it needs more beads - my son wanted to fill all 5 posts but ran out of the 'right' bead to complete the additional patterns. As with all M&D toys, the quality of construction is great and even given the few minor flaws I mentioned, I would still purchase this item again."
1,A dud (albeit rare for M&D),"My experience is exactly the same as the ""Not Impressed"" review. Yes, I'm the dummy who bought this despite a negative review that pointed out obvious flaws. Hopefully you will not be the same.I usually love M&D; products, and in general, they offer a much cheaper alternative to traditional items for those interested in Montessori, Waldorf, etc. I'm here to buy a child's M&D; flute and this came up, so I'm compelled to share my experience:This product is so bad that I've just left out the shapes for imaginary play and put away the rest of it. It probably IS ok for younger kids to practice threading and stacking, but to use it properly to learn patterning is probably more detrimental to a child's development than nothing at all. The colors and shapes don't match the control cards at all, which of course is The Point Of This Game.M&D; needs to find a new vendor for this one. It's a hot mess, which I recommend that you side-step around. And that's how I really feel :-)."
1,Frustrating!,"First, the set does not come with enough beads to complete more than 3 sequences (dowels) at a time. Why do they include 5 spaces? Secondly, there is a hexagon on the pattern, but no hexagon block. Several of the shapes are hard to distinguish and match. It is frustrating for me, let alone my 3 year old. Don't waste your money."
2,Beads don't match patterns,I just ordered this Bead Sequencing Set for my four year old and was very disappointed. The bead shapes and colors don't match the patterns and makes it hard to teach patterns. One pattern shows two purple squares and the set only comes with one purple -so are you suppose to substitute with a dark blue square?? Confusing.
3,Cool and disappointing,"This toy arrived and we were disappointed with the quality of the craftsmanship. We usually like Melissa and Doug products. But we have had it for about a year and all but one of the slots that hold the sticks up is broken, so the sticks that you stack the beads on don't stand up anymore. It is really now broken and must be recycled. Also the pictures on the cards, don't match the bead colors or shapes, making the matching part of this game sort of meaningless. Don't bother."
4,Sandra Bullock as Vicky Lucci?,"I love this series! The Vicky Lucci character begs to be in a movie -- a female lead with a sharp brain and a smart mouth. And the hospital settings are a nice change from most mysteries. The plot serves the characters and the characters entertain. A perfect ""take on a plane"" book."
2,front space too tight,"This should not be called a lumber pack. Aside from the water bottle space, it is hardly different from a money belt. The front compartment is very narrow and tight; I can barely fit my thin wallet inside, never mind my cellphone and keys."
1,Too small to be of use,"This holds very little - very thin. Maybe a sandwich and pair of gloves - nothing else.Also, when the water bottle (which is a bit over a pint I think) is full, the weight is not carried comfortably.I think it's nearly useless."
4,Great innovative music and dancing - annoying intervals,"The music of David Byrne is funky, innovative, rhythmic and engaging. He approaches his music as an art form and therefore keen to explore innovative and expressive dance routines to complement the music. The choreography is fascinating how the two lady choreographers melded the dance in with the music. Even the backup singers were drawn in although not comfortable at times.The program is mixed with interviews and insights as to how the production was all pulled together. This information is interesting but I would have preferred it to have been separated as bonus material and not interspersed between each song. Also, if you removed the interviews the program is only a tad over 1 hour in length which makes the production quite short.Nevertheless it was still worth buying the blu-ray."
3,"David Byrne's Ride,Rise,Roar.","I think that the decision to bookend each song with documentary excerpts was a blunder.Not only is the impact of the performances reduced, but it also becomes somewhat tiresome. In addition some of the song selections are poor. For example, 'Road to Nowhere' is not a B.Eno/D.Byrne track, and 'Life during Wartime' is mediocre in this performance. I can only assume they were included because they are recognisable to more people. However, there are some great performances, 'Houses in motion', 'Once in a lifetime' and 'I Feel My Stuff'"
4,I loved this concert!,"This was really a unique and fantastic show when I saw it over 2 years ago. The DVD presentation brought back great memories and I enjoyed meeting the rest of the dancers and musicians involved in the production. Having seen the show, the DVD does not present the flow of the original performance, rather showing only a few numbers between periods of off stage footage. Regrettably, a lot of great songs were omitted. A bonus disc would have been nice."
2,Terrible over-editing,"I give five stars to David Byrne, the band, and the choreographers and dancers for a great performance. The music and innovative dancing are great. Unfortunately the director/editor didn't choose to show the performance, but decided instead to slice it into 1 second shots from all over the place, so we can rarely ever see what's happening on stage. INFURIATING to try to watch a show edited like this, and it does a great disservice to the dancers and choreographers because we don't get a chance to really see what they are doing like the live audience got to see. So a 5 star show is lowered to a 2 star video, ruined by bad editing."
5,Just what I've been looking for!!!,"I LOVE this DVD. I have looked and looked for a practice that I could do with my baby. I had the hardest time trying to find time to exercise or do yoga after the baby came, and I looked everywhere. I tried videos, I tried books, and I didn't find much that worked for me. The baby always needed me before I could get 10 minutes into it!But THIS is different! I love it! Your baby is in every single pose. Ann figured out creative ways to keep your baby in your arms or close to your face in almost all of the poses. I love it. My baby loves it! Half the time she falls asleep while we do it!Ann offers helpful comments for those who had c-sections, also. I liked that a lot.I also LOVE the two soundtrack options. You can pick calm piano music or more upbeat new-agey music. It helps keep things new. I really like it.I highly recommend this DVD to all new moms!!"
2,For beginners and sleeping babies,"I would only recommend this DVD for moms who did not do any yoga pre-pregnancy. The poses are not challenging in the slightest - holding your baby with one arm while waving the other up and down occurs too many times for my taste. Also, I made the mistake of thinking that having the baby integrated in each pose would be great entertainment for my baby. Wrong. Holding your baby while you do a yoga pose does not, to me, mean that the baby has been well integrated. If your baby is sleeping it's fine, but if he likes to be bounced, swayed, or moved in any way, he will get bored and will not be still enough for you to hold the poses."
2,Could be better,"I was disappointed. When shopping for Mom & Baby DVD's there doesn't seem to be much of a range. Either it's for a little baby (like this one) or it's for Mom & Toddler. My daughter is 9 months old and is mobile (rolling, almost crawling). She wouldn't sit still for this at all. So there's an age range for the baby that this would be appropriate for - but they don't tell you that. This would have been great when she was little, immobile and slept a lot but we're well past that. If your baby is older than an infant, save your money."
2,A good place to start...,If you are looking for a yoga program to do with your baby at home then this is a good place to start.The low rating is due to the poor production values - image and sound quality - and the fact that only one routine is available. While the one routine takes a fair while to complete I felt more routines would've been better value for money. It becomes a bit boring once you've played the DVD more than 2-3 times.
3,mommy and baby yoga,"Okay DVD. my daughter is 8 months old. This DVD was a little slow and boring but i guess it would be good for a newborn baby. Overall, okay dvd."
2,Too slow for me,"I did like the dvd but it was too slow and too relaxed for me and the baby. Perhaps I'm used to more upbeat yoga programs and my baby is too active, but I felt like I was about to go to sleep. If you like a more slow paced yoga practice then this is for you. If you like to keep things moving and not feel like it's dragging, I suggest a different video."
4,Wish I could do it more,"I ordered this DVD as a way to get back in shape after having my baby. I thought it would be great because I could do it with my baby, instead of waiting for him to nap, and wasting nap time working out (when I could be showering, or napping myself!) Unfortunately, my baby hates it when I try to do this yoga. I don't know why, but he gets really fussy and becomes unbearable after about 5 minutes. But I do like the DVD, and they explain how to do it if you are sore from your delivery or c-sect. I would like to use it more!"
4,Relaxing with Baby,This video is a great way to destress and relax for both mom and baby. We both love the time spent together while doing this video.
2,Slightly Disappointed,I was really excited to try this video but when I tried it with my baby she was 4 months old and it didn't engage her enough so I was only able to do a couple minutes before she would fuss. I feel like it is better suited for a 1-2 month old. Wish I had tried it then!
2,One word....BOOOOOORING,"If your Baby is not at all active then this video is for you. My Baby is far to active to hold in these poses, and I think she's about average in that department. Not for me, and my active Baby!"
1,Not for non-hardcore Christians,"I wish I had read the reviews here before picking up the book. Let me state right off (to prevent the sure-to-happen viscious replies) that this is a well written, thoughtful book. It is, however, written specifically for ""serious"" Christians.The cover and title are somewhat misleading. I thought it was going to be geared to a more general audience. I am sure that for those looking to regain touch with their Christianity it is worthwhile reading. But if you're looking for something that is not so centric into 1 belief system, then this isn't the book for you..."
5,Perfect for those of us that need Dallas for Dummies!!!,The author clearly and honestly takes you through the processes required for human transformation. The book is very readable and realistic.
5,Just the right gift,This is the perfect gift for my dad for Christmas. I just hope that no other parts have to go to this to work.....as far as I know there isn't and should just work.
4,Kayak Fish Finder,I absolutely love this product. Taking it out on the kayak improved my overall fishing experience. I was able to target structure and land more fish. I would recommend this to anyone kayak angler.
2,Not For Hot Climate Areas,"It worked fine here in Florida during the winter months when the temperature was below 90, but when the temperature went above 90 the screen was no longer visable until temperatures went back down (even at the highest contrast setting). The unit also doesn't seem to be water resistant... for sure it's not waterproof. After getting caught in the rain, the unit would from that point on have HEAVY water condensation on the inside of the screen. So much so that the screen was unreadable at the edges. If you live in a moderate temperature zone, this will probably work fine for you (just don't let it get wet). If you live where the temperatures get above 90 frequently (like Florida) this is a waste of $$$."
2,170 fish finder,ordered 5-25-10 as of 6-28-10 I have relocated transducer 5 times not getting bottom reading or fish. 6-29-10 they are sending another transducer to they think the transducer is bad waiting to see.
2,Can only troll with it,Was surprised by the fact that speed is restricted to trolling only with this product. Makes it hard to speed to where the fish are. This should have been noted in the sales literature. Guess I will be sending it back.
2,Buying this was very difficult,"I did my homework and read every review twice, just to try to find out WHAT came with the unit.I puchased the 160 dual beam unit, and did not get a suction cup mounting. This is what I had to havebut nowhere on this page do you get that information. You do not get a carry-case, a battery, or anythingof the other items mentioned in the reviews. Buying on this item on amazon was more difficult, (and unsuccessful)than driving to a store and getting it there. I also do not see where I can buy this mysterious suction cuptransducer attachment, so I plan on returning the whole thing."
1,"Chinese made junk ""Lemon""","Bought at Wallmart for over $200.00 Worked great for 1 year 3 months,I think i used it 6 times. then one day it would not work. Thats right 3 months after the warranty ran out this product failed.I sent it in to get it fixed and they will charge you a set fee of 80.00 some dollers to fix whatever is wrong with your unit. I would not recommend Humminbird products to anyone."
3,Ok i guess,"I had gotten this for my 14' inflatable kaboat with an 8HP motor (its a cross between kayak and boat)i attached the transducer on the mount area and it worked fine for a few trips.I was out on the boat fishing with someone in the bay and saw a few fish on radar flashso I decided to cut around and get closer. When i cut around the transducer somehow just randomlydecided to fall off and when i looked down i saw the cable snagged in the propeller. With the cost ofthe transducer being almost the cost of a new unit I'm just replacing the unit from the 160 to the 170.if I have the same problem I wont be buying anymore from Hummingbird. Also when i say randomly fell off i mean randomly I was out on the water for around 3 hours and doing various speeds and it was fine then, but doing a low speed turnabout causes it to fall off? weak."
2,Failed Humminbird 170,"I was happy enough with my Humminbird 170 for the less than two years that it worked. On day, it failed to power up. Long story short, I contacted Humminbird and was told that it would cost over $60.00 to have it repaired. Considering the less than $100 initial cost, this is hardly worth it. I am disappointed in the fact that I could not get what I would consider service at a reasonable cost from Humminbird. I am disappointed that this unit failed all too soon considering its light usage and good care compared to competitor models I have previously owned. I now will have to reconfigure my boat to install a different device; now having to change the transducer and unit mounting and wiring. I cannot recommend this product or Humminbird to others.Humminbird PiranhaMAX 170 4-Inch Waterproof Fishfinder and Dual-Beam Transducer"
5,Fine product except....,"I purchased this portable fish finder based partially on the previous reviews. I intend to use it on destination fly-in fishing trips in Canada. I was surprised by two things....first the product seems to be a collection of parts...assembly is required. Second, depending the transducer included, the unit doesn't fold into as compact a form as what I was led to believe. There is no picture on the outside of the box as to how the folded up unit will look. I will have to take care protecting the transducer during travel as a result."
4,Purchase of Portable Fishfinder,The product is working excellently for me. It is the idea unit for my fishing kayak. The only problem I had was one part in the order was missing(screw that attaches screen to platform. I managed to rig up a replacement screw rather that try to get the part sent.
3,piranhamax 160,Product is typical of a medium priced fish finder. Power cord is a problem thathummingbird should address. Prongs rust and fall off regardless of protective sprays.
2,You get what you pay for,"About the only thing cheap models like this are really good for is depth and water temp. If that is all you want a little unit like this for, then they are perfect. For reliably finding fish, they are near useless. The fish icons are meaningless estimations. I have one installed on my console for that purpose. For serious fish finding and identifying structure, you need a higher end unit from your manufacturer of choice. I use a Garmin Echo 500 when trolling. If you are going to have only ONE fish finder, spend a little more money and get a reliable sonar unit. You get what you pay for."
5,Humminbird Piranh max 170 fish finder,I had the good fortune to find this fish finder on Amazon as well as being rated by consumer reports as a good product. So I ordered it and recived it in short time. enstalled it easyly on my used boat. we used it while fishing at our favorite fishing spot Cove resort with great success no triploids but nice rainbow.So thank you Amazon for having a great product and Great staff to process and ship the order.K Buckley
4,Hummingbird Fish Finder,"The system works as expected, I have a stern mounted sender on a outboard, and until about 6 KPH it gives depth readings. After that I get no readings, which I expected. Mounted properly in a thru-hull fitting with can filled with epoxy, it would probably work better, but the thru-hull setup is more than I want to go with.The depth meter is what I was looking for and it does work well (below 6 KPH)"
5,PiranhaMAX 150,Great product for the money! So far everything has been in working order and the installation is very simple. Recommended to anyone that is buying a fish finder for the first time.
1,DOA,"DOA says it all. Never powered up. Support is central time 4:30, so west coast people are pretty much out of luck on week days. Guess I'll be getting another model from another company."
5,sadly mis-titled,I found this book in a second-hand store or never would have spotted it on amazon searching under tales of horror and the supernatural. I truly believe it is why this superb anthology is hardly known among devotees of the genre.WHAT A SHAME!!! And shame on the publishers for the error.This is my favourite collection.For example its got Graham Green and Walter de la Mare those wonderful writers How Love came to proffessor Guidea that sickening horror classic and The Monkey's Paw the one always told around camp-fires It has many unknown or lesser known writers with their gems too
4,"Sturdy pieces, nice puzzle",Bought this for my children for Christmas (both under 6). Both enjoyed putting it together. The pieces are nice and sturdy and the image is just different enough that they had little difficulty sorting the pieces and putting it together.Very good puzzle overall.
3,Nice puzzle,Nice puzzle and big picture. And for a really good price. My little kid love it and me to :)
3,What happened to the Ravensburger Quality?,"I was sure I am getting a typical Ravensburger Puzzle (like the 35 piece dinosaur puzzle we have!) that's nice and is well made. Already when I openend the package I was surprised to find all these tiny blue paper scraps inside the plastic bag. I thought once I shake it out, they will be a thing of the past... But that wasn't the case. The backing feels and looks cheaper, the pieces are on the thin side, even the front is a bit uneven over this type of backing and the blue scraps still come off, leaving an unsightly blue dust behind, and affects pieces from nicely interlocking. The box says: Made in Check Republic, like others too, but there must have been a QC oversight. I would rather pay a bit more and have a better made puzzle. Disappointed in the quality, but like the picture and my kiddos play with it."
2,No surprises here.,"Captive III offers little more than predicatable sexual interludes involving unimaginative activity. The writing is repetitive and amateurish. For a cheap thrill, the book does nicely. Beyond that, you might be able to do better yourself."
3,How to ride a horse ?? where is it ?,"They said it is a complete collection of all the goofy's short , but they forgot the animated short "" How to ride a horse"""
4,NO PLAY ALL FEATURE!?,"Just like the other reviewers have noted, this is a wonderful video. But, the biggest and only complaint is that there is no ""Play all"" feature. Why? There are 46 seperate videos that you have to press play on."
1,"Lack of ""Play All"" feature is Goofy","Disney released this DVD set minus the PLAY ALL feature. This makes watching this DVD annoying. If I had known Disney was going to remove the PLAY ALL feature, then I would NOT have bought this DVD. I recommend you avoid this DVD until Disney adds the PLAY ALL feature."
1,Moms need the Play All Feature,"Disney really [messed] up. Where is the ""Play All"" that is on the other Treasury disks. I'm a mom, my kids get to watch a video while I take a shower or mop the kitchen floor (like most kids). That's just not possible with these disks. I will not buy this as a gift, I will not buy a second one. Disney should remake the disks with a play all and send them to anyone who wants a replacement..."
3,Waiting in anticipation,"Will comment again after I receive the package, which I have just ordered from Canada.Really hope the title I'm ""sweating"" on, Motor Mania, is the one I saw here in Australia in the 50's titled ""Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Walker""Didn't realise they had different names for different regions in those days?I'm sure I will be able to correctly rate it highly after viewing."
2,"Prehistoric Menu Options ~ What Were you Thinking, Disney?","Cartoons are swell. However, it's a MAJOR disappointment/ Hassle to have to click ""Play"" on EVERY Single toon. You can't simply ""Play All"". You must reload each toon from the menu. Not only that, you must click down to the next one, it doesn't do it automatically. It's not out of laziness, but necessity! I put this on for my 2 year old so I can do some household chores but every 6 minutes my son's screaming for me to change the dvd. [A real Horse & Buggyesque Menu, Disney!] I think these discs should be recalled and replaced to us owners free-of-charge by the corporate giant."
4,Hand Mixer Died......... 6 months after Purchase,"I purchased this during Dec. 05, I'm still enjoying the product but my handmixer to this set died after six months the can opener and the salt & pepper grater are what is used most in my home. It is now 2007 and the batteries are still holding up, If I had to purchase this Item all over again, I would."
2,"If you are Begginer, don't waist your money","The book covers stuff to make you database more pretty and faster (usig it) but forgot to explain the realy important matters.If you develop Dbases in access and want to know how to make a button change color or disapear, buy this book (or look into the properties of the object:)"
4,Access and VB,This is one of the finer books for the beginner VB programmer when using Access 97. All examples are geared for Access 97 and have relevance to what the new user of Access would want to know. Little or no experience in VB is necessary as this book will guide you step by step. Well worth the money!!
2,Only if you already know VB,Maybe it would be ok if you already know Visual Basic. It is mostly about building data-entry forms and where to insert your VB code.
3,"A starting point, but lacks details","This book is probably a good starter book if you want to find out how VBA can be used to customize Access applications. However, you may learn more about Access than VBA. In this reader's opinion, the fundamentals of VBA are not presented in a timely manner. The topics of writing functions, bugging and error trapping are not discussed until Chapters 5-7, while a discussion of object oriented programming is not presented until Chapter 12! The author presents the subject of VBA by using VBA to customize Access applications in a series of specific ways. If the reader's applications match one of these scenarios, the techniques outlined in this book probably can be used quite successfully. If not, a more detailed, comprehensive book and more work on the reader's part may be necessary to fill in the ""missing pieces"". Unfortunately, the""step by step"" format of the book makes it difficult to use as a reference book."
3,"Um, nice to see reviews here, but . . .","... the recording hasn't even been released yet, right? Or am I missing something? (I keep on waiting for its release, but haven't seen that event occur, yet.)"
1,Rip-Off,"This entire soundtrack is a rip-off of Jekyll & Hyde the musical. Just look at the track titles! Unless they (being the producers of this concept recording) just happen to have the same track titles as Jekyll & Hyde, this CD is a scam and a rip-off. The German recording of Dracula: the musical is gorgeous and I've been waiting for an English version for ages now. I've found variations on YouTube and what not, but THIS recording that amazon was selling - totally a rip off of Jekyll & Hyde."
3,Can you help me find a copy of this musical?????,I am actually looking for this CD and wondered if any of you who own it know where it can be found? Please help!
2,tribute to the elders,the music was good but the quality of the recording of this cd wasn't as clear as the other cd i received that day from you.
2,Disjointed jaunt through Pellegrino's ego,"After reading Unearthing Atlantis I was was eager to jump into this book. I was disappointed with its lack of organization and dubious claims. There are a few interesting stories, but overall it reads like a tome on how adventurous Pellegrino thinks he is. A very self-indulgent sequal to the fine Atlantis book."
2,False Title!,"When I purchased this book, I thought it would have given me all the information I needed to know about Sodom and Gomorrah. It started off okay giving some information about how the author came to the conclusion of writing this book. Not even far into the book, the topics drifted way off course and the book got really boring to point where I started skipping pages. That is a big deal because I always read everything cover to cover. Don't waste your time with this book."
5,Pellegrino at his best,I have enjoyed everything I have read by Pellegrino. He is very successful at pulling together ancient mysteries with current scientific discoveries while keeping the book entertaining. I have learned many new things from this book.
2,A book for show doggers,"This book is almost entirely fascinated with lineage and other dog show concerns. If you have a Westie as a pet and need a health, training, have fun with your dog book, this isn't the one I would recommend. If you DO order it, maybe you'll get the one i sent back . . . ."
2,Obviously $20 doesn't mean much to Kate Spade.....,"Or she would have spared me (and other buyers) from paying for her advice, information, opinions, and knowledge on her version of ""entertaining"". Most of the information is irrelevant - unless you have your own caterer, florist, maid, bellman, limo driver, party organizer and an unlimited amount of cash. Dispensing advice on how to entertain using caterers and servers is hardly applicable to most of us who do not entertain in a posh Manhattan apartment. The section on ""Weekend activities in the Country..."" is perfect insight in to how contrived and artificial the life of Kate and Andy must be.Although one might try and find the book humorous - in order to justify its ridiculous overpricing. The real joke is on me the purchaser of the book as I was the one duped and the Spades are laughing all the way to the bank."
2,Hmmm,"I bought this book as a gag gift for a friend, assuming that it would be full of cutsie little ideas for parties... maybe a few recipes and quotes and bits of ettiquette.I read it on the way home, and was bored to tears. There's nothing I love more than entertaining and pretending to be sophisticated, but this book was niether. It told me almost nothing that even barely related to reality, and that which was complete common sense that any 5 year old could tell you about having friends over.I ended up returning the book. It wasn't even worth it as a gag gift."
2,Kate - You need to stick to handbags!,"I anxiously awaited the release of this book, as well as the other two in the series. What a disappointment! There is nothing in this book that is new or exciting. Kate offers the same old, tired suggestions that you can find in any book on entertaining. The watercolor illustrations are cute but that's about it. This book has no substance and reads more like a children's book then anything else. For $20 these books are overpriced, as is anything with the Kate Spade name on it. Don't waste your hard-earned money so she and her yuppy husband can laugh all the way to the bank, or their ""summer home"" in the Hamptons! :-("
2,Re-hashed Work,"I agree with the other reviewer. I bought all of the books in this series and am shocked at how much of the advice has been taken from previous authors on these topics. She is copying classics like Emily Post and simply re-wording the text. Except for the cute drawings, this series is a waste of money. If you want to know how to do things ""correctly"", read Letitia Baldridge's ""The New Manners For the '90's"". It covers everything and is written by a woman with the education and experience to know of which she speaks! Not someone who using her fashion connections to flood the magazines and talk shows with her ""discovery"" of this information."
1,Never received!,I never received the book o ordered! Over a month now. Ordered another nook the same day and received long ago.
4,Good power cord,This is a power cord for an old shaver that I had bought for $4 at a flea market. The cord was frazzled and I decided to buy a new one. It does what power cords do. This one is very light and flexible and doesn't feel like it's on a power drill. What more can a person ask for?
5,"Great price, performs exactly as expected","Ordered this adapter on a Sunday and received it two days later. Nice! Plugged it into a Sharp Zaurus SL-5500, and it works perfectly at home and in the office. Configuration of the PDA was incredibly simple. Looking forward to using this to check e-mail while I'm on the road.The adapter seems to consume a good amount of power, but I think this is to be expected of any CF network adapter (wireless or wired)."
1,Wavelets for Greeks with a PhD in Math,"The into sounds like a vary informative and helpful book that would be halfway useful and understandable. But on arrival it is a desert filled only with Greek character sets, complex integrations, no illustrations or examples, or coding one might actually use etc. A very dry and barren landscape devoid of helpful our useful examples, distinguished only by a platitude of math characters and ever more complex integrations, unless you’re a PhD in math and savor juicy complex matric analysis this in not your helpline. A book that perhaps is the worst example of making something already complex and difficult to understand even more complex, less informative reference. A big disappointment to say the least."
1,False and Misleading Listing,This listing says it is for a 25 pack of cutting wheels. BEWARE. You can pay 35 to 50 dollars and all you may get is one wheel and not 25 like I did. Amazon should confirm with the sellers that what they list here in the offer is what they truly offer.
5,Book Worth Reading,"When I first saw the title ROAR i was turned me off as I had just lost my beloved Benji. However, as I read the reviews and learned the author's definition of ROAR - it then made sense. While I did not write in my copy I did use it as a guide in my journaling."
3,How to ROAR,"It was an OK book. When one is grieving, just about anything out there to help cope is a good thing. I found the poems very moving but some of the workbook questions were redundant."
5,Amazing Product,"I've been using this product for about a month now and I am so happy with the results!! I was losing hair because of crash diets and nothing I tried to reverse the hair loss actually worked so well as this product does. Initially, when I first used it, I noticed that the product plumped up my hair strands so it had the look of thick hair. Now a month later, my hair has significantly improved in hair thickness because of new hair growth and my hair also looks very healthy. I've also noticed that when I wash my hair I don't seem to be losing a lot of hair either. Thank God for this product!"
3,Cat-fight,I've seent this movie two times and have been impressed with some of the action shots. Cat Sassoon fights in the style of the geographic area of the world - more of a kick-boxer. It is a decent action flick where the women fight just as hard as the men.
1,Angelflop,"Awful actioner has Cat Sassoon entering a Filipino martial arts tournament to investigate the death of her sister and discovering a plot to assassinate a U.S. ambassador. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed, Sassoon scowls through the whole film, and our male ""hero"" is a doofus. There are, count 'em, three different shower scenes to up the sex factor. Really bad."
3,angelfist,girlfights? why not? saw it a few times ten or so years ago so i knew what i was getting. rarely order anything on speculation
1,A Very Misleading Movie,"Even though I watched this movie in fast-forward, I could barely sit through it. The Box Art told me about one movie, but the one inside was a completely different one."
3,Not sure that it makes a difference,I like the concept of this...I'm not sure that it actually moisturizes/protects or not though. I also am not so fond of the smell. It's kind of like a musty hippie-ish smell. Not terrible..but not one that makes me feel like I smell good.
4,Beautiful ring,got the ring for my husband just one problem it was too small. Havent sent it back yet. Wish it came in a bigger size. Definitlly worth the price.
2,bland bananas,"Save your money! There was probably one comedian that made me chuckle, but the tape is pretty lame. Clean comedy can be funny but this one didn't make the grade."
5,A masterly reference work by a knowledgable professional,"Les Potter has worked with my organization to develop a strategic plan using the principles espoused in this book. He's great, and the book is great. For the cost of a dinner out you can turn your moribund organization to a front runner, using this book. I recommend it 100%."
1,Big Disappointment,"This DVD is a big disappointment relative to Silly Symphonies or the Mickey Mouse in Color series. First, Disney inserts unnecessary and definitely not-entertaining commentary by Leonard Maltin in many places throughout the DVDs. There are a few very minor, insensitive references to ethnic groups in the cartoons which would probably go unnoticed, but Maltin draws unwarranted attention to them. Secondly, unlike the first ""Mickey"" treasures collection, this one has no ""play all"" button. So you have to go back into the TV room every nine minutes to turn on another cartoon for your youngster! If you could get beyond these two great annoyances, you would find the actual cartoons entertaining."
3,"Good for film students, might be boring for kids","I got this one mostly because it has the first Mickey film ""Steamboat Willie"", and also out of a sense of curiosity about what the early films were like.The selections are all pretty clear but still sometimes scratchy, guess the restoration people couldn't fix everything. I found the stories to be rather boring, posibly because the age in which they were produced makes them so alien to modern sensibilities (Maltin touches on this in discussing the types of humor, racial stereotypes were one example).I found that I didn't like most of the stories except for that one Mickey and the beanstalk story- Giantland(?). I did think it was interesting to see an early version of Goofy, then called Dippy Dawg, little resemblance to Goofy as he is today.Film students/historians will find something to watch here, casual viewers and small children will be bored."
4,MICKEY MOUSE,"IF YOU WATCH THE VIDEO TAPE CALLED ""HERE'S MICKEY"" THEIR IS A CARTOON NAMED ORPHINS BENIFIT AND ON THIS DVD ITS THE SAME EXACT CARTOON, EXCEPT ITS IN BLACK AND WHITE. WHY WOULD DISNET DO THAT???"
4,Keep Pushing Buttons!,"I couldnt agree more, that this is a significant addition to everyones cartoon library. I dont have the presence of mind to argue the pc of cartoons created before pc existed. I can tell you though, that the play value, ( not the replay value ) is significantly reduced by the lack of an play all option. Why instead of enjoying this collection, am I forced to continualy KEEP PUSHING BUTTONS?! Mickey in Living color, and Silly Symphonies, both have this basic feature. What has changed? Disney Wake Up!!! If I want to push buttons, I'll play video games. The only reason this collection does not get five stars, is the lack of a play all feature. Why take a beautiful collection like this, and make you KEEP PUSHING BUTTONS!For the end of this review,Push the Button."
5,Just might be the most important cartoons of our time,The DVD is as good as it gets.These are one of the greatest and most important cartoons to see.This is a must have DVD and a very great thing to own.
2,"Great Mickey DVD,but gets a F for features","The Dvd has some great Mickey shorts on it.The problems comes with a lack of play all feature.some people say disney did this so little kids could not see all the so called bad shots.Well if there that bad release Song of the south on dvd,if disney will release this then they could do the same for song of the south.I think the feature was just left out by accident,if not this will be the last disney treasure I will buy.the goofy dvd has the same problem.Letter to DISNEY FIX IT,or lots of loss sales will follow."
4,A Little More Information on Mr. Maltin,"A couple of notes to ""Yarby"".Leonard Maltin is not a self appointed expert. He is the author of ""Of Mice and Magic"", the authorative book on theatrical American animation.If you would check another of Maltin's book ""TV Movies"", he gives ""Song of the South"" a very high rating. It is BECAUSE of people like Maltin, that the ""questionable"" material in these collections gets shown at all. There is great presure these days to cut all this material out. (Note recent bows to pressure stopping screenings of Charlie Chan movies on cable and ""The Birth of a Nation"" at a cinema in Los Angeles.)Maltin is one of our best American film historians. If you don't like his screen presence, I recommend you to his numerous books. He is a fine writer."
3,No continuous Play?,"I can't take exception to the reviews of these shorts form the standpoint historical significance, although I'm not sure how 90 out of 91 people agreed with a review posted over 2 months before the DVD was released...What DOES irk me though is the inability to play the discs non-stop. Someone at Disney decided we would be better served to return to the menu after each cartoon. Can't speak for others, and I hope this is important information to some of you, but I consider this to significantly lower the ""replay factor""."
2,Merchandise Review,Not what I thought it would be; I am an LCSW who wanted to use this as a reference for my client's prescriptions. This is not a very useful book and I would have been much better off buying a PDR.
4,Tjader at his eclectic best!!!,"I am a 44 year old female, and I heard this album back when I was in my teens, and Callen Radcliffe Tjader has spoken to my soul ever since. We lost a great one when he became an ancestor. Thank you Cal, for leaving behind a legacy that can still speak to my soul."
2,Nothing special,"It's like the words are used to decorate the artists' crappy computer graphics. Not interesting at all, the type makes it difficult to read. The text is just a short paragraph taken from Beautiful Losers; better off reading that instead."
1,BAD QUALITY AND SERVICE,"I bought this modem over a month ago...it doesn't work, a completely dead modem. Once their technical department was convinced that it wasn't due to my error, they agreed to take it back. They RELUCTANTLY agreed to mail me a pre-postage package for return, but it has never arrived. This is a bad product, as well as bad customer service, plain and simple. Trust me, avoid it if you're not wanting to be out a modem, as well as the money."
2,ANDERPOP,"This CD is pop music with te thin voice of Jon, only two songs were insteresting. I didnt like it."
1,Jon Anderson Animation,"I love Jon Anderson, but the supplier could not send the cd because of damage. It has been nearly thirty years since I heard this album. I hope one day I can purchase it again."
1,I Agree With Others,I agree with othersThis CD has been very badly put together.The sound is harsh. I thought there was something wrong with my Hi-Fi.It is such a shame as we've been waiting so long and Jon's music is so brilliant. I don't know if anyone else has noticed too but the title track fades out too quickly.
1,Jon's Best Solo Album - Worst Media,"As a follower of Yes for about forty years and a fan of Jon, I have to say this is in my opinion his best solo album. It's creative, fun, has a lot of solid writing and production. However, I agree with everyone... don't purchase until someone re-issues a high quality disc. It's a shame his best solo work is trashed on CD."
4,Animated,"Well, I too bought this wondering about the re-mastering process. But I don't think it's that bad. Yes, I think there is too much high end and the middle needs to be boosted. I gave it 3 stars for sound and added another for the art work and the included lyrics."
5,THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CD,"Very good cd, a little bright though. Even though ""The Spell"" is from a demo cassette it has resaonably good sound considering. Atlantic should have let Jon finish The Spell for the original record.All the nay sayers here must have something wrong with their cd players."
1,A bad '80s film,"One night, a young man is bitten by a transvestite and undergoes a strange transformation during a full moon. Sounds like it might be campy and fun, right? That's what I thought until I started watching this film. Usually bad acting and a bad script can be funny and make a film worth watching, just for the sake of its badness. Not in this case.The sound and picture quality of this dvd are sub-par. I had to up the volume many times to hear what was being mumbled. Also, the film is very grainy and too dark. I have to give them kudos for the idea behind the story, though."
4,VERY DETAILED BOOK FOR THE IN-DEPTH READER...!,"Gary Schroen, author of - ""FIRST IN: How Seven CIA Officers Opened the War on Terror in Afghanistan,"" helped readers of his book to get a full or panoramic view of just how the United States of America (led by the covert intelligence and military might through battle-field tactics, constant morale of the fighting men and women, and their individual patriotic and national pride)."
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed the book for the story that it told but it didn't provide as much detail or action as I would have liked. It's hard to blame the author for this since he is simply telling it as it happened and is limited to providing details approved by the CIA but I was expecting a little more.Perhaps I was just expecting the life of the first CIA agent into Afghanistan post 9/11 to be a little more action packed and a little less about relationship building. I blame Hollywood for my inflated expectation (jk).Either way, I appreciate Mr. Schroen's contribution and would say that this is a worthwhile book, just not at the top of the list."
4,God bless Gary & the rest of JAWBREAKER,"This is a great book and is certainly worth reading. It provides INCREDIBLE detail on day-to-day operations inside Afghanistan. If you want to learn more about relations between the CIA, State Department, Northern Alliance commanders, Pashtun leaders, Pakistan, etc, then this is for you. You'll learn a lot. If you want more front-line fighting detail, this isn't really it. Toward the end, it gets into some of the fighting, but it's mostly setting things up, inserting teams, etc. The CIA guys did great work and their story deserves to be read."
3,Okay,"This book was pretty good and informative but the author was a bit stuck on himself. A lot of back patting. And the things he seemed to complain about. Not being treated like a superstar by field agents at different stops?? Also, someone claiming to be doing a mission so tough and rough yet complaining about the amenities during travel to and in the AOR seems sort've weak."
2,Very slow,"Very slow book. Thought there would be a lot more to it, but just never really picked up. Got to understand a lot of the bad living conditions and politics before the war, but just was not what I thought it would be."
2,Case for Management.,"Maybe this book picks up later but I'll never know. God what a disappointment, this book is nothing but procedures. ""I went to this office for this.."", ""I had to fill out the correct CIA form for that.."", ""I had a meeting with so & so..."", geez. what a snooze-fest, I put it down under 50 pages, I can't take it, unless I need something to put me to sleep. I guess if your career is management, you'll find all this terribly exciting, for the rest of us, there's nothing here but bureaucracy & utter disappointment."
1,boredom,"This book is a complete waste of paper. The reader is subjected to page after page of disgustingly graphic descriptions of diarrhea (the author's), flatulence (the radio man's), the construcion and instructions for use of Afghan toilets and, not least, the ""fact"" that Afghan men wear long shirts so they can move their bowels in public and remain covered while doing so. The author also appears to burst into tears at the slightest provocation (perhaps he bores himself to tears!)."
4,"A detailed, thrilling and celebratory account of the CIA's role in the Afghanistan war","Gary Schroen was the head of the first CIA team to enter Afghanistan after 9/11 and his account of the preparation on the ground of the Afghan war is a detailed and thrilling narrative of modern US electronic warfare.Bumpy roads,high mountain peaks,secluded valleys,helicopters, warlords, talebans and, eventually, intelligent and dumb bombs, are the main elements of the story.The tone is of course celebratory, as becomes a tale of war told by the victors,and the author tells us that it has been extensively 'reviewed' by the CIA's bureaucracy, but the report is nevertheless accurate and credible.Recommended for all, pro or against the war. and a must for hollywood producers."
4,Great Insider's Insight and Adventure Story,"This is a very good first-hand report by a person who lived the events in Afghanistan. He gives vivid descriptions of the harsh environment and the many players and interests involved in the troubled country. His editorizing is valid as he is in a position to know the truth as he sees it. I am being a nit-picker, I know, but the quoted conversations between other team members and their contacts could have been left out as he wasn't present during their meetings. The impression I am left with is that our giant bureaucracy didn't know what was going on before, during, and after September 11, 2001, and it still doesn't. The pretty squabbles and turf wars that hindered Schronen and his team and their mission still occur."
5,very well written,A lot of research went into this publication and the places cited really come to life....I know because I am currently in Afghanistan.
1,"Once again, this book is proof ...","... for my theory that any mention of the word ""Hollywood"" in the blurb of a book instantly disqualifies the author.I am indeed fortunate that I saw the book lying around at a friend's, instead of buying it. I be even more fortunate, however, if I had more friends with better taste than that."
3,Sare's Review,"""Happy Easter, Little Critter"" by Mercer Mayer was a good children's book, especially for around Easter time. Children would most likely like the illustrations because they are cute and bright. I think the book would teach kids about Easter, and the different things that go on on Easter day. It starts off in the morning and tells about him and his sister getting their Easter baskets and getting ready to go to church. The book also tells about what they do in church and the lunch and Easter egg hunt they go to with other families after church is over. I think there are some good morals to the story such as helping others and getting along with your siblings. It shows children how much fun a family holiday like Easter can be."
3,BEGINNERS GUIDE TO THE GENOME RACE,"Well written and easy to read accounting of the race to decipher the Human Genome. However the book is only suitable for readers who have not read any other books regarding the race between commercial interests (Craig Venter of Celera Inc.) and the US Government in the form of the National Institute of Health under Francis Collins. Most of the books contents have already been written about in Kevin Davies' Cracking The Genome. However The Gene Masters does give some additional information regarding Kari Stefannson in Iceland and his goal to databank all genomic information regarding Icelandic citizens.Redaers looking for a little more substance to their genomic information may be interested in ""Transducing The Genome"" by Gary Zweiger."
3,"good, but short.","These are great tracks and the remixes are good. The only problem is there are only 3 songs on this single. I just wish there were more remixes, because 3 tracks hardly make a CD worthwhile."
4,Like New!,"Book came in a decent amount of time in excellent condition. Great bargain, especially for a hardcover edition."
5,YOU DONT NEED THIS CABLE TO PLAY SYSTEM LINK,you honestly dont need this cable to play system link. All you need is a CROSSOVER rj-45 ethernet cable. I got mine today and I tried it out with my friends and it worked fine. You can find these cables a lot cheaper than the XBOX brand one. So again you just need to ger any regular Crossover cable and u cant use your regualr everyday ethernet cable because it won't work.
1,throwing your money away,"a 5 minute class from a radioshack employee lets you make your own ""cat5"" cable which is what your xbox uses. Its basically a slightly larger phone line and plug. The trick is in knowing the correct colorcoded order of the eight wires protected within the outer insulation when fitting on the plug. You will need to buy a special crimping tool which should also be able to crimp phone lines not that you'll need it. Even with the tool, plugs, and cable you will pay less, especially if you plan to link more than two xboxs."
1,Just a crossover,"Since it is just a crossover, it will only allow you to hook up directly to another xbox, and not to a hub w/alot of other xbox's, or over a VPN to play halo over the net(yes people have figured that out already) Not to mention its way overpriced."
1,Get a crossover cable,"Like the other people have said in their reviews, get a crossover cable...If I want more playbility with more than 1 XBOX, I'll use the four port HUB I invested in. Save yourself the money and don't buy this. =)"
1,Just a over hyped cross-over cable.,"This looks like a pre-packaged cross-over cable (will not work with some hubs or switches). Also if you want to use something like this instead of XBox live, see XBConnect.com."
3,umm...,is that just green lan cable or is it specifically for the xbox because it just looks like a regular cat5 cable tinted green... and anyway... they've just developed the idea of linking systems back in the day of ps1... im definetly getting one though... i just want to know if i can just use my lan cables i have laying around my house... because im guessing if you can hook broadband internet connections to it then it must have a lan card...
1,Untitled,"Another great example of American Economy at its best, take something relatively simple and common, then slap a pretty package on it, and charge at least twice the price for it."
1,Whoop-D-Freakin-Do,This this is just a crossover cable. The only half cool thing about it is that it matches the controler cables. I just sat here at work and made my own cable in less than 5 minutes. COST: FREE. Who's the man now??!! Don't make fun of my name......
2,A Fair Read,"Pretty good cover artwork - horrific internal artwork, fairly decent story about the brother's in Jamaica. Good amount of action and swift paced. Lots of interaction with the criminals as a large amount of the book is spent with the Hardys in pursuit. Nonetheless - it cannot hold a candle to the earlier volumes in quality, writing style and suspense. RATED C-"
5,"great, informative book","I enjoyed reading this book. It is detailed, informative and a well rounded book. Gives you a more scientific look at what is going on, why and when."
5,An internationally acclaimed raconteur,"I may possibly be the first person in the UK to have read this, but I certainly won't be the last. I'm glad I bought five copies - the friends I've lent it to don't tend to want to give them back!"
5,Buy This Book,"Then read it -- aloud or silently, in snippets or one fell swoop, Sailor Jim's yarns never fail to entertain. And once you finish it, you'll find yourself recommending it to others, too."
2,not working,I have purchased the product in the past and it worked great. This time it printed out only half of the photo. I don't know if it is the paper or the portable printer. I don't see them in the store any longer so I can't find out. For that reason I will not purchase the item again.
2,OPPOSITE OF,"Depressed? Read this novel on a good day. Three siblings, a brother, sister and adopted brother, are all victims of various forms of abuse in their childhoods. The brothers leave home as young adults to live in a London house their parents own that time has turned into a dump. Neither has been able to plan for a career, perhaps distracted by their crippling family life or the inability to plan ahead. Thinking (or not) that inheritance will come their way, the brothers take jobs that compromise their already shaky morals. Meanwhile, their unstable father continues to drain the family wealth by indulging in extravagant landscaping on the family estate outside London, despite protests from his usually disinterested wife. When the sister can no longer tolerate living with her parents, she moves into a closet in her brothers' already cramped quarters in London. Her presence escalates an unhealthy competition between the brothers, and a perfect deranged storm erupts."
1,Don't read it.,"In a few words, disturbing, over-indulgent, misogynist, homophobic, sadist twaddle. And completely, unbeliavably pointless. (The part were the loathsome protagonist forces himself on his mentally unstable half-sister who then commits suicide was outrageous, how can anyone enjoy reading such a book is beyond me.)"
1,Lack of,"I feel bad for Mr. Amis. He's obviously in love with himself, and he's not a very interesting person, so the relationship is probably as boring as the rotten novel is. Boring. Boring. Boring..."
2,Not a substitute for the TU Guides,"Newman's book is comprensive, but far too general. Maps are not detailed enough - how about directions to some of these places? I also fails to even begin to cover on the great Saltwater opportunities. I feel the TU Guides by the specific chapters are far more comprehensive. Newman is President of NYCTU."
3,It's Okay,"It's okay. I wish I could have found one not previously owned. Paid a lot for it, and it smelled like cigarettes :-("
3,Must Read!,"Te Velveteen Women is an easy to read, thought provoking book that helps put you in touch with your ""inner you"". God made YOU special and unique and wants you to be YOU...not a fake. Through scripture, prayer, and personal search, this book breaks you away from the unrealities that you live. After finishing the book, my ""walk"" and relationship with Christ is deeper."
5,The Velveteen Woman is a believable book filled with hope.,"Brenda Waggoner writes as if she is talking to you on a personal level. She openly and honestly takes you on a passage from experienced trauma to hope in just 200 pages of quick read. Once you've read the book...you go back and savor a little more slowly the journey of becoming ""real"". Waggoner invites the reader to come to an understanding that unconditional love can transform us from what we have become to what, surely, is a more pleasing state of mind, body , and soul. She invites us to become real...the type of ""real"" that we were intended to be. As you read the Velveteen Woman, you will wipe the tears from your eyes as you enjoy the warmth that suddenly surrounds you. You will find yourself wanting to be a better friend, a better mate, a better person. I'm going to read it again."
1,oil filter relocation kit,The hoses have different treads than the part that attaches to engine block and to filter. I used a sealant to stop leaks. Three months later one of the hoses burst. Bad product. Very low quality.
1,"A couple of improvements over the earlier edition, but still WORTHLESS","I was saddened to see a new edition of this book out on the market to waste the studying time and effort of a new crop of peds residents, but here it is. I flipped thorugh it and found it essentially no better than the terrible earlier version(s). Distracting. Poorly researched. Laden with typographical errors. It manages to provide chunks of useless info in some topics while still missing key points in others. Quite a feat! Save your money."
4,Good book in slightly used condition.,"The book is excellent. It arrived promptly in good, slightly used condition. For the thirty cent price it is a good value."
5,An excellent book on signal processing,"This book studies the two signal properties we are most interested in, time and frequency. Unlike other books, which usually concentrate on one topic of advanced signal processing, this book covers both time-frequency and wavelet analysis. The author organizes these topics in a clear structure with vivid English. The reviews at the beginning of every chapter are veryhelpful for readers. Before I have this book, I read some mathematics books on wavelet analysis that were difficult to understand. The author explains the theories not only mathematically but also physically. Thus, this book gives me great help during my research on vibration and noise control,modal analysis and acoustical signal processing. I strongly recommend this book to those who study signal processing."
3,Traditional heavy metal ain't dead yet!,"Lionsheart is a heavy metal band of the old school. Singer Steve Grimmett (ex Grim Reaper) has been around for some time and he has a good voice but a tendency to go for the highest notes a bit too often. Any fan of traditional blues based metal will probably find ""UNDER FIRE"" (1998) to be rather enjoyable. The material is hard and heavy but still rather melodic. The album starts with ""Lonely tonight"" and before it really kicks off, guitar player Brooke St. James gives us proof that he is suitable for heavy metal mayhem. Other memorable tunes are the heavy ""Go down"", the groovy ""Devil's train"", the speedy ""Under fire"", and the melodic ""Dark of the night"". Some references to Whitesnake have been made, but I don't think the similarity is that striking. I do believe though that Lionsheart's debut album (different line up but same singer) is a bit stronger. Anyway, this is a solid and decent heavy metal album worth three stars."
5,As promised,The item delivered arrived on time as promised and was in great condition! Excellent buyer. Thanks!!!
5,Very Helpful Explanation of Why Globalization Doesn't Work,"Globalization simply doesn't work.It can't work.Since adopting globalization, the USA has lost much of its manufacturing sector along with the decent paying jobs to off-shore suppliers.But the third world countries have also lost as they are forced to play a game of beggar-thy-neighbor by constantly undercutting one another with lowrer wages and looser environmental protections.This book explains why so many oppose globalization in steadily increasing numbers."
4,"A Good, Solid Foundation From An Old-Time Boxer","There's not much flash in this book, and that's the way it was meant to be. Thomas assumes you know nothing (or next to nothing) about boxing and gets you started right. Many of the ""spa boxerobicise"" types may look down on this book, but it's full of good common sense, won the hard way. I personally had no problems with the Champ's stories, even if they are exaggerations. Over the years, I've learned plenty from old timers who were known to ""improve the truth"" on occasion."
2,Downhill From Here,"In the mid-70's there was a change in direction for Steppenwolf, the band had left in 1971 on a hard-rocking album, and came back in 1974 with pop influenced album. For the next album, ""Hour of the Wolf"" the band comes dangerously close to do disco sounding material. They went a step further and actually did with ""Skullduggery"". There's some good ole rock n' roll here and there on this album. One more Mars Bonfire composition. A completists/hardcore fans only album. Not for the new fans."
2,No Goldy + No Larry + No Nick = NO GOOD,"This 1975 release saw the band at their lowest point since the beginning of their career. Gone was the great band from the Monster\Live days with the only remaining band members the drummer and the lead singer. When Larry Byrom left after the 7 album they lost a great writer\ guitarist and this is the first effort without origional keyboard player Goldy McJohn. They also miss Nick St. Nickolas even though George Biondo is a fair bassist. If you want to hear good Steppenwolf then buy 7, Monster, or maybe the Second. For hardcore fans only."
1,Save your money.,"I guess it's my fault. I was hoping to get Louis Leakey and instead I got Jon Stewart. My fourteen day free trial lasted a record six minutes. The first article I read was Jason Rosenhouse bashing conservatives. Are you kidding me? The next article he was bashing Southern Baptists. What? Can I please just get a science blog that has science in it? As with many other so called science blogs, this guy is disconnected and contributes nothing. Do not waste your time."
5,Where Was This When I Was A Kid?!,"This DVD is so terrific that I wish I had grown up on it like my two boys are now. I have a nine-month-old and a four-year-old. They actually sit and watch ""Singing Babies"" together. Usually anything for my nine-month-old will not hold my four-year-old's attention and vice versa. BUT, this DVD does. This allows me the much needed time to pay bills, clean up, and make dinner. It's a great baby-sitter and teaches them at the same time. The quality music doesn't drive me insane on multiple viewings like some of the other videos that we have purchased. I highly recommend getting ""Singing Babies."""
5,A Classic For Sure!,"This DVD has captured the mind and spirit of my 8 mo. old boy, Duncan. He lights up like a Christmas tree every time I turn on the DVD. It makes his day. The tunes are all familiar and bring back memories of when I was a kid. The DVD has babies singing onscreen with special effects that are quite real. My baby thinks the babies are singing to him. He is so fascinated, joyful and active every time the DVD plays. I highly recommend this DVD over many of the other music DVDs for children."
5,100 Percent Satisfied,"My eight month old Trevor has been watching both Singing Babies videos since he was six months old. He loves it. The songs get him bouncing, smiling and clapping. He just can't get enough of those baby faces. He even tries to kiss the screen whenever one of the babies comes on. So, the other day he started babbling at the babies on television like he's having a conversation with them. My husband thinks he's trying to sing. It is really something to see. The boy will sit silently until the DVD is on, then he's a chatter box. Funny."
1,Don't buy this DVD for your child,"This DVD is the worst DVD ever made! The babies have large adult mouths superimposed on their faces, and added to that, they're totally out of proportion. It messes up the expression, which is sure to confuse little spectators, and gives the appearance of oddly deformed creatures who never smile while they're singing. It looks like something out of Tim Burton's work. Whatever you do, DO NOT waste your money on this horrible DVD."
1,Weird,Just a very strange concept and I have a home daycare and thought the kids would like it but oh no!!
3,Ghetto production,The picture quality and the production value was subpar. They copied and pasted adults' mouths over the babies' mouths to simulate the babies singing. It's kind of creepy.
5,Where was this when I was little?!!,"What a wonderful collection of songs with really rich orchestrations. Jenna, 7 months, gets so animated the moment that I play this toe tapping stroll down nursery rhyme lane. The babies are somehow able to sing the songs, which really astounds Jenna. Very original and entertaining."
5,The Babies Really Work On My Babies!,"My youngest baby twins, age 15 months love to watch Singing Babies. They watch the babies singing onscreen and try to sing along. What a great idea to encourage vocalization and really get babies to know the nursery rhymes. Smart and fun. A real favorite for my girls. A definite must-have! Highest Recommendation."
1,WEIRD AND CREEPY DVD!!!,"I bought this DVD based on the large number of good reviews and was incredibly disappointed. This is the WORST children's DVD that I've ever seen. It's a montage of children sitting in various scenes. The voices are from adults trying to sing like children; but, they don't sound like children at all. They sound horrible. Equally bad, perhaps even worse, are the graphics. They superimposed adult mouths, big adult teeth and all, on the children's faces. My 22 month old didn't like it either. He looked at the strange children's faces with adult teeth and unnatural movements with a perplexed look on his face. This is a very WEIRD and CREEPY DVD! Don't buy it!"
5,My Daughter Enjoys These Fun Songs,"Bought these both for under $6 with shipping from the seller ALLACTIVITY a few months ago for my then 19 month old daughter. Can't beat the price, super affordable! She enjoys these dvd's a lot, loves to dance, giggle and sing along to them. I thought the superimposed mouths might be creepy, but not so. Fun dvd's that are teaching my toddler new songs and rhymes. Not the highest production value, but kids don't care about that, the simpler the better so they don't lose focus."
1,no quality one to buy.,The worst one i can say.the babies lips are graphics with some others and looks very ugly and bad......dont waste the money to buy this......Not even worth for a doller too.....
5,Truly Great!,"Toe-tapping, hand clapping fun. All the songs I grew up with. My two-year-old can't get enough. My husband and I love singing along too! Comes with CD soundtrack, which is terrific. Totally worth adding to your child's DVD library."
5,Love finds its way back...,"Going through a divorce is kind of the same as a death. I'm now going through a divorce and it's very emotional. I've said I don't want to get married again, but there's got to be someone out there to love me again. Julie has give me a little bit of hope. Not all men are yucky. This book is very worth the read!"
4,The Guardian,"Moves a little slower than most Sparks books have, but it will be interesting to see where this plot leads. Going to be a love story for sure, & hopefully the ""good guy"" wins out in the end without too much tragedy appearing in the story line. Heartbreak always appears somewhere in Sparks books before the ""good"" part. Definitely enjoying the read & would recommend it because I think perhaps I identify with the female character."
5,"Engaging, exciting read!",I don't know why it has taken me so long to start reading Nicholas Sparks' books. I started reading 'The Guardian' on a day-trip to NYC and finished it just a few days later... couldn't put it down! Now I'm indulging myself in the rest of Sparks' books and loving every one of them! Enjoy :)
4,Not Typical Sparks,I liked the story well enough and had to finish the book. But.... not what I was looking for when I picked up a Nicholas Sparks novel. I enjoy his intense romance novels and that's what I was looking for. This was combined that with a thriller aspect and just threw me when I was reading it. I actually got kind of worried & upset about the goings on which from the writer's standpoint is good. Just not what I wanted at the time.
5,Great Nicholas Sparks Book,This book was great and a little different from some of his other books. It was a mystery and a book about relationships. I really enjoyed it.
5,The Guardian,If you love pets this is the book for you. You can picture this Dog's actions as you read along. Hero's are not always people they can be your pet. Love the store all the way thru.
1,For the dogs . . .,"So, like, this guy dies, then comes back as a dog (but a very precocious and sensitive dog) to take care of his widowed wife? If that's the kinda sappy nonsense you're into, by all means, read on . . ."
1,familiar plot,This book was extremely elementary. One can figure out how it is going to end during the first few pages. I read it anyway hoping it would improve. It didn't. There haven't been many good books this summer and this fits that category.
5,An intense story of emotional recovery and new romance,Julie lost her husband to brain cancer and she's left a lonely widow - until some unexpected gifts from her husband begin her recovery. Four years later she has the choice of two seemingly wonderful men - and a nightmare which will lead her to a life-threatening situation instead of the peaceful romance she desires. The Guardian is commended as an intense story of emotional recovery and new romance.
4,Good but predictable,"I must admit that I wept like a baby at the end, but to tell the truth, I knew what was coming. I felt like the book moved rather slowly and Sparks felt the need to drag out the story. And, at least the print version that I read, mixed up the characters of Jennifer and Julie (p.335). All in all, a good book but could have been shorter!"
4,Predictable,The book started out very well and then got in to a predictability as far as the story line. I finished it anyway.
2,Heart-wrenching novel,Great read! It sucks you in and you fall in love instantly! It keeps you entranced throughout the entire novel!
1,People doing stupid things,"Usually, when I don't like a book and know I won't read it again, I donate it to the Library. This time, I'm throwing it away, so no one else will be disappointed as I was. Characters kept doing very stupid things: for example, suppose you knew that a serial killer was stalking you -- would YOU go for a walk alone in the woods? And, rather than running from the bad guy or taking any logical, effective action, characters often were ""frozen with horror"" as they watched him approach. Sparks writes well: to bad he chose to write about such stupid people."
3,Get on with it already!,"Believe it or not, this was my first Nicholas Sparks novel. I thought it was a great weekend read, although it tends to drag until you get closer to the end. By that time, I was ready to put the book down and move onto something else, but once it finally grabbed my attention, I was turning pages like mad. Whether that was to find out how the story ends, or to simply get to the end, I'm still not sure.The characters are believable, as was the storyline, but getting there was exhausting. Most of the book centers on the development of the two main characters, Julie and Mike, and several times I found myself thinking, just do it already! Then you have Richard Franklin to deal with, an obsessive psycho whose every action screams, Warning...Warning, but true to form, Julie ignores her intuition and gives him the benefit of the doubt, only to find herself in need of rescue.I'm not sure I'll run out and buy another Sparks novel anytime soon; I'll probably just wait for the movie!"
5,So good,Oh my gosh! What a great story. I was catching myself on the edge of my seat but also feeling compassion. The story was written do well and touched on different aspects that all came together in the end.
3,Enjoyed it,"This was a decent read, but not what I expected. Kudos to Mr. Sparks for switching things up and trying new things. I've read a good bit of romantic suspense though and this just didn't stand out from the usual girl-in-jeopardy story. I loved the dog though. Mike and Julie were likable. Richard was hatable. Andrea was pitiable. Probably only Mabel, Henry and Emma were interesting and they didn't do anything. Their characters had little quirks though like Mabel's disappearance and reappearance (that'd make a great book) or Emma's unexpected advice to always marry someone who loves you more when it seems she's the one who adores Henry. There weren't many surprises from the main characters, but it was a fun ride. I appreciate authors who try different things."
3,The Guardian is a hit!,"This is a good book. I enjoyed it, it is a little different from Nicholas Sparks other books. It has a little more suspense to it. The only problem with this book is that for someone like me, and avid suspense book reader, I guessed the ending. Not the entire ending, but some of it. I would still suggest reading it. It has a good plot line and the characters were built in a great way. As with other Sparks books, you really get to know the characters and what they are thinking. If you like Nicholas Sparks, then you will really enjoy this."
5,Another Great Nicholas Sparks Book,"One of Mr. Sparks more complex books. A story of Love, Loss with an underlying element of fear and danger. Great Book."
4,The Guardian,"This is a normal Nicholas Sparks story. I enjoyed it as I generally enjoy his stories. It has the grief, suspense and final working out of the situation in much the same way as other books of his but it is a good read."
2,"Um, what a quandry","OO gee, I am a young woman of satisfactory economic standing who owns a dog. I'm pretty! Who do I date?!When I picked this book up at the supermarket, I was hoping for a thriller read. I hadn't read Sparks yet, and I was willling to give anything a chance (I am a chronic insomniac). It's pretty stale. Once you get to chapter three, you pretty much know the whole story. Even the main review here on Amazon gives away so much of the plot... Ridiculous.I wish it were better. But it isn't!"
3,Something always lacking,"I have read nearly all of Nicholas Sparks' books, and yet I still wonder why. I guess I am amazed at the popularity of this simple, unexciting style of writing. His plot ideas may have some merit, but his execution is on the level of juvenile literature. I truly want him to succeed, because there is little to choose from that is not filled with graphic violence, foul language, and sex. But I wish there were more substance to his writing, more imagination. The Guardian is filled with every cliche known, truly amazing in this day and age. On the positive side, it does make me consider a writing career... :)"
5,A Sweet Story,"Nicholas Sparks at his best. This book is quite different from his others and having read all his books, I believe this is his best by far. His characters are real, and I related to them easily. Singer is, of course, a favorite! Naturally, as with all Sparks' books, it's a tearjerker so be sure to have a box of tissues handy. Once started, you will find The Guardian hard to put down until the end. Enjoy!"
1,Wrong item...,"Wrong item was sent and received. Although was given a full refund and kept wrong book, I never received correct book."
1,Gross,"After opening the package with the book inside there was a very gross stain on it, not sure if it was blood or ketchup I did wipe down the book with lysol wipes. Worst experience ever with an item."
4,Well worth the read.,I really enjoyed this book. Definitely recommend reading it. Love story with a twist of danger to keep it suspenseful. Enjoy.
3,Good read,Sparks delivers again... This one has your classic love story with a twist of danger and drama. Overall would say it's worth it
3,Is it over yet,The beginning was good but it became a slow boring read for me waiting for something to happen and then waiting.... I loved the romance between the characters and the love of a dog was a great touch
3,Not his best.,"With The Guardian, Nicholas Sparks has tried a new style or direction other than his usual type of story line. I was very disappointed in it, it lacked his usual indepth emotional side. He pulls his story lines from real life experiences and heartaches. His stories don't always have a happy ending, therefore, I don't know what to expect until the last twenty or so pages. I have read all of his books and will continue to in the future, but out of all of his works I am sorry to have to say I liked The Guardian the least. Please go back to what you know best."
1,"Stick to Romance, Sparky.","Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does."
2,trite and predictable,"This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read and guessed the plotline from the bookjacket summary... not surprisingly, I guessed correctly a very predictable storyline. Though love-obsession is a scary situation to be in, Sparks' writing did not make me feel compassion or empathy for protagonist Julie. I found all of the characters to be very shallow and not well-developed, mostly stereotypical.Sparks' writing style is clean but uninspired, filled with stock phrases and a bland rhythm (the shouts aren't shouts, the italicized thoughts don't have any weight). Hope that standard writing formula isn't prevalent through all of his books, if I should ever read another book of his again."
3,Not as well as expected,"Ever since I read[and re-read] ""A Walk to Remember"", I have eagerly awaiting all of Nicholas Sparks latest work. Needless to say I was somewhat disappointed. ""The Guardian"" had its moments and parts of it were interesting to read. The other parts weren`t. I found the characters not as well developed as they could of been and the plot didn`t make sense at times. Sparks should stick to his earlier style of writing. If you want a good novel of his try ""The Rescue"", ""A walk to remember"", or ""the notebook"". I gave it three stars simply because it is a Nicholas Sparks book and his next novel will hopefully be better."
1,"Read it before, saw it before, nothing much new here","I picked this novel up for a quick read on a long rainy weekend [we have lots of them up here, so I read a lot]. The cover wasn't standard ""Romance Novel"" fluff and neither was the jacket blurb. Imagine my disappointment when the author telegraphed the entire plot in the first twenty or thirty pages! I knew what would happen, who would do what to who and why, all before I really got started reading...and the heroine didn't even get a chance to deal with her life on her own. This would have been better if it'd been handled with more humor and less melodrama.All I can say is YUCK! Save your eight dollars and go to Starbucks instead!"
2,Too much jelly...,"Nicholas Sparks' ""The Guardian"" is like a poorly made peanut butter and jelly sandwich...The nourishing part is spread way too thin and the jelly is really piled on. The bread's a little soggy too...and it cakes on the roof of your mouth. To translate the analogy: not enough sustainance, way too much sugar, and some very second-rate prose to hold everything together. Certainly not of a caliber of the earlier Sparks novels--avoid this concoction."
3,Not Impressed!,I realize that this was his first mystery romance but I would have liked a better mystery than a stalker. I loved the story line between Julie and Mike but the one with Richard was too weak and did not hold my attention. So instead of wanting the book to go on I could not wait to finish the book and lend it to someone else. I only hope that his next book is much better to make up for this last one.
2,Predictable!,"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' other novels and used to enjoy them but this one was so elementary that I don't know know if I can read another sappy story set in a snall North Carolina town with the same predictable, albeit sad, ending. His first novels were a new voice but now it seems so overused. If you read his 2 page ""acknowledgements"" you know where he gets the names for all of his charaters - I know that it is nice to feature friends and family but use some creativity now and then. The book was slow, the chacters so one-dimensional - even the dog was annoying. I canceled my order for the next Nicholas Spark novel, I can't stomach another love/death story."
2,Stick to Romance,"This book was great until the end. Spoiler alert! There is enough animal abuse in the world - why would Mr. Sparks need to put a reader through this type of horrific end for a loyal, beloved pet? I couldn't put the book down, but I was sickened, disgusted, and angry at the end. I have read all of Mr. Sparks' books, but this one was in very bad taste. Furthermore, the author romantizes allowing a dog to run off and take himself on his own walk. Mr. Sparks needs some education on dogs - and should stick to strictly romance. No more pain involving animals, please, and aren't there enough dark stories written without this author jumping on the bandwagon? This was a bizarre attempt at blending a happy-happy, joy-joy romance with a crime drama about a psycho."
1,Not so hot!,"I saw Mr Sparks [speak] where he explained that when he first wrote this novel he thought it was ""the cats meow"" then received a 19 page editotial review from his editor. I'm wondering who got it wrong on this one, the writer or the editor, maybe the book was better before the revisions. It's very predictable, the dialogue is not believable and there's way too much repetition on female intuition and the old ""geez that sounds familiar, but I just can't put my finger on it"". It's a good beach read, but no great literary work."
2,Predictable,"I am a fan of Nicolas Sparks, but this wasn't his best work. I am yet to read books that measure up to ""Message In a Bottle"" or ""A Walk to Remember.""""The Guardian"" was incredibly predictable, the characters seemed cliche, and so did the plot. Honestly, reading the book was like watching a cheesy made-for-TV movie that only comes on after 3am.For the record, I hated the ending."
2,Disapointed,"I have read all of Sparks books to this point. I must say that I was a little surprised at this one. Not his usual love story. It held my interest. But I was very disappointed with the ending. Not to give to much away....But the ""Singer"" ending was terrible. Then for Sparks to say in his Author's notes at the end of his novel that stories like Old Yeller, Where the red fern grows, To Dance with the White Dog were the inspiration for this novel made me laugh. He is NOT that good of a novelist. His books are good for a quick read...........that's all"
3,A Page Turner,"This book definitally held my interest, but I can't say it had me on the edge of my seat. Sparks did a great job with the characters- they are easy to relate to and fun to become friends with. He wrapped it all up nice in the end, but I wasn't left feeling ""wowed"". It was easy to guess what was going to happen next. A good story overall however."
2,"Predictable, Repetitive, Boring","As I started reading this book, I felt as if I was reading in a style written for a young teenager. It is very simply written; with many comments and observations repeated over and over again. Once I got the rhythm of his writing style down, I started to skip every other page. I am not a fast reader but I was done with this book in one hour. The story is so predictable that you know exactly what will happen. The characters are fairly dull. It will probably be a movie of the week."
5,excellent,The service provided was very professional. Not one problem or even a need for a question from me. excellent service.and on a very timely manner. The quality of the item purchased met all expectations. well satisfied. Amazon deserves a ***** star on this order.
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Sparks and have read everything he has written except this. I read this for a bookclub and was hoping that it would be good. I didn't like this book at all. I was very slow, and I skimmed about a fourth of the book."
2,Plodding and cliched,"I thought Nicholas Sparks was a better writer than this. After a slow beginning, Smooth Boyfriend turns out to be a psycho and a stalker. Then the plot needs serious help, so Sparks drags the bottom of the cliche barrel and brings out a stupid, sexist police investigator who doesn't believe Nice Boyfriend and Innocent Heroine. As soon as Nice Boyfriend starts doubting Innocent Heroine's story, I completely lost interest. We weren't yet 70% through the novel and I couldn't imaging what cliche he was going to bring up next to help this poor, struggling plot along. Don't waste your time!"
5,Captivating,I have read and thoroughly enjoyed most of Sparks books but this one was definitely unique in that I thought I had Mr.Sparks figured out but a twist came into place in this particular book that told me to never underestimate the Author. A must read for Nicholas Sparks fans.
4,Very well written,Story line was great...nice slightly different plot for Nicholas Sparks. I enjoyed it & couldn't put it down once I got through the sluggish start.
3,It's a renter,"I'm glad I checked this one out of the library. It was a predictable story, but entertaining enough to get me keep me awake on long drive home."
4,A Page Turner!,"Like many of the reviews, this was a difficult book to put down. I enjoyed the fact that Sparks was combining suspense and romance. And while some may say the ending was predictable, I wasn't totally prepared for it. Perfect book for a day at the beach!"
3,"Eh, just so-so","I almost gave this two stars, but I felt generous. :)It's too cheesy. I mean, the dog acts like a human around his owner, Julie? Come on. And he saves her at the end?!?! Give me a break.I didn't realize how slow the novel was until I read the other opinions posted here. It really is pretty slow for the first half.The only reason I could give three stars is because it did leave me feeling creepy at times. It's just so dark for Nicholas Sparks, although it was nice to see him do something a little bit different.Maybe he wasn't really trying for anything profound."
4,Good Read... Sparks is great,"I'm a 23 year old male, engaged to be married and I've read his books since I was 18. He always writes comfortably and this is no exception. The book always had my attention and was very enjoyable. Found myself in Mike's shoes many times throughout the first half of the book. He did a good job, but no Dan Brown thriller. I think it's just another enjoyable book from Sparks. Thanks Nick, you're great."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Okay, so Sparks' other books haven't exactly been literary masterpieces either, but at least they pulled at your heartstrings and made you feel so sort of emotional connection to the characters. Not so in this book. This qualifies as one of the worst books of the year imo, and it was really hard to care about any of these characters or the storyline in general. The book was extremely predictable, unemotional, and simple (in terms of writing, plot, character development, etc.). It is a real waste of time, but based on Sparks' name alone this book will unfortunately be heralded by many without more discerning tastes in reading material."
1,"absolute drivel, sophomoric, waste of time","After hearing a few episodes of this book read on a local public radio station, I was so curious that I checked out the reviews here. I was thinking that the book had to be a spoof. The writing is of the ""see spot run"" calibre. That it could be a ""national bestseller"" is almost unbelievable. I'd never heard of Sparks until now, but he seems to have come up with a good formula. (I intended to give this book no stars at all, but Amazon requires a rating of at least one star in order to post a review.)"
5,Tear-jerker!,"I loved this book- romantic, hopeful, & full of love and happiness! What a tear-jerker! I'll admit it- cried quite often while reading! Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer and I recommend this book along with quite a few others! If you are into romance, this book is for you!!!"
4,Good story--love dogs so that helps.,Very good story. Anything with a dog makes for a good story line in that they love us unconditionally. Would recommend.
3,lackluster,"Sparks is one of my favorite authors and he is usually a good read, but this one gets tedious at times, is predictable and why make us love a character and then kill him off! That ruins the whole story for me."
4,Very Good Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed the read. Having read all of Nicholas Sparks' books, I have not been disappointed yet. The Guardian does not top ""The Notebook"" which was and still is, in my opinion, the best he has ever written. But it held my interest and was hard to put down. The idea of the dog touched my heart because I have my own large dog that has been my constant companion for ten years. I completely understood the relationship between dog and owner. The story is very believeable and realistic. I give any book that touches my emotions as this one did a great score. Job well done."
4,Your typical Sparks novel,"I have read all of Sparks novels and each time I put them down and wonder what was different about this one from the last one. I mean, it is true that in each story, the plot deviates into some different angles but overall Sparks writes about the love between a man and a woman and the trials it takes to get there. No difference here.Now, with that said, if you have enjoyed his other books and like an easy read this would be a great book for you. I bought the book and within two days had it finished. Easy to read, easy to understand, easy to predict....but a feel good all the same."
5,Probably My Favorite Book Of All Time.,"Let me start by saying that for me to read a book from start to finish, it has to keep me interested from start to finish. This book did just that. It's got a little bit of everything: romance, suspense, a dog (which I love!). This book is very well written, easy to follow, and easy to get into. I have probably read it at least 3 times and will most likely read it many more.This is by far one of Nicholas Sparks best books! (Now if only they would make a movie out of it!)"
4,The Guardian,"Not too heavy. Easy read. Enjoyable. Up to par with Nicholas Sparks other books. I like to read over the week end and this filled the bill. I like happy endings. I want to be entertained. Daily news is depressing enough, I like books to be upbeat."
3,A very different Nicholas sparks book,"I enjoyed it, although not my favorite from him. Safe haven had a villain, it wasn't sinister, this novel was, I like suspense, but this was scary..."
3,The Guardian,Started out way to slow...only about the last twenty five per cent of the book was exciting. I have read better books by this author.
2,SLOWWWW.......& not in a good way!,"A Nicholas Sparks fan & after reading reviews on this book, I purchased it for my Kindle. Maybe the 2nd 1/2 of the book does get interesting (as other reviewers have stated)BUT the problem is staying awake & interested enough to get that far!! As usual his writing is great, the wording very natural and real...but this story line is sooo boring and it didn't have to be. He just keeps going over & over the relationships between characters to the point of redundancy! VERY difficult to ""get into"" this book, unlike ""The Lucky One"" that has you hooked from the first paragraph. Pretty sad when the DOG is the most interesting character in a book! This one was a BIG disappointment to me!"
5,The Guardian,"This book was fabulous ! I couldn't put it down. I love the ending, except the fate of Singer (the dog). I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a romantic suspense."
5,Great Romantic Thriller - Different Storyline for N.Sparks,This novel is different from the rest yet similar. The tone and elements of romance are consistent with his other novels but the suspense of a thriller novel is also part of this one. Like his other novels this is also a page turner and once you pick it up you cannot put it down. You can tell that the details regarding the characters have been well thought out and that the background characterization is really well done. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it.
4,"Not his best, but still satisfying","While The Guardian is not my favorite of Spark's books, I found it to be still a satisfying read.Even Sparks himself acknowledges in the afterward that this book with a plot based half on suspense- was something new for him & that it took a lot of work. I have to say, it was odd reading a book of his where romance wasn't 99% of the book!In this book we meet Julie, whose husband recently died of cancer. Her life pretty much consists of a few close friends, her job at a hair salon & her quirky dog. Julie, afer a few years of being a loner, decides it's time to get out & date again. And that she does...unfortunately she meets Richard- who turns out to be a little scary. In the meantime her close friend Mike is there to help her pick up the pieces...Overall I did like the book & loved the characters! I think most Sparks fan will appreciate this book for what it is- his attempt to put a twist into his formula & keep his readers guessing."
3,not really a thriller,i was so disappointed when i finished reading this book because i didn't really find what i expected.It's not a bad book but can never be called a thriller! at some parts it was so boring that i had to convince myself it's going to be better later on so that i can continue reading! I bought this book on the basis of the reviews but i had my lesson...this book was not a romance nor a thriller but not a really bad read.
2,if only the dog had a person in him,This book had the potential but turns out to be like any other stalker thriller. There is nothing new here. There was a chance that this book could have been great had the author allowed the dog to maintain the premise that it contained the soul of the the boyfriend killed. Its ends with a dud.Skip this one.
2,Disappointing,"I am a Nicholas Sparks fan and read all of his previous books. I realize Nicholas took on a new genre when he wrote The Guardian, however, I didn't feel the warmth of his characters as I did in his other books. The story line was slow, never amounting to a climax and very predictable. The ending was extremely upsetting and disappointing! The Guardian is my least favorite book of Nicholas Sparks."
1,Very disappointed.,"I could not believe that he staged that precious dog the way he did. I was upset for days after reading it. The story is great and hard to put down. The characters are interesting. But, to an animal lover, the ending ruined it for me and this is likely my last Sparks book."
3,Entertaining,"I believe that reviews are interesting to read because of the diversity they provide, but at the end, you will have to read it yourself to make your own assessment. I have read many of his books and also seen several of the movies made about them. I found this book to be entertaining and enjoyableto read, but I would not compare it to The Notebook, Message in a bottle, The last song, or Dear John to mention some of my favorites. I was moved by these books - my heart touched. In The Guardian, although I enjoyed reading it, I found it to be somewhat predictable and not as appealing to my taste."
4,Sparks doesn't dissapoint,"The Guardian is another great movel by Sparks. What I liked most about the book is that it has a love stoey, which is Sparks' signature, but it also has elements of suspense. This makes it a page_ turner."
3,The Guardian,"Not the best of Nicholas Sparks writing. I found it a little drawn out and boring. A strong fan of Sparks,I kept reading just knowing the book would eventually grasp me. It seemed he waited until final two chapters to create a plot and then it was as if he just rushed through with an amateur writer's ending."
3,Lame Ending ***SPOILERS***,"***SPOILER ALERT*** Do not read if you don't want to know the ending. First off, I'm a softie and hate to read any book where an animal dies needlessly. And I certainly do not want to read about it in minute detail. ""He was trying to outrun the pain in his stomach"". ""And then he began to pant"". But, while this dog is certainly at death's door, cannot even lift his head, at the end he miraculously recovers to come running to protect his mistress??? I know, I know, symbolism, symbolism but it was just beyond hokey for me.As far as the other reviews talking about how the author repeats things? If I read, ""he placed his hands in front of him"" or ""she pushed her hair behind her ear"" one more time I was going to scream!"
3,The Guardian by Nicholas Sparks,"The setup of The Guardian reminded me a bit of Safe Haven, also by Nicholas Sparks, which I loved. Sadly, it did not measure up...or come even close. The Guardian wasn't bad; I just didn't find it to be great either."
5,Loved this book,"Still crying. Once again Nicholas sparks pulled my heart strings. I really loved the dog element, he should include dogs in future novels."
1,Gets nothing right,An utter bore at the beginning. This is the clumsiest romance writing I've ever seen. Progresses to a predictable but mildly interesting stalker situation. Has a disgusting ending. 'Nuff said.
1,"Tedious, tedious, tedious....did I mention tedious?","This was my first Sparks book to actually sit down and try to read. It was unbelievably slow, tedious, grating, and filled with a lot of nothing. Save your money. The heroine is just a little smarter than a rock. The boyfriend might as well be a scarecrow in a field. (Apologies to all scarecrows, they actually DO something. The only action that takes place until the end of the book is in the very small minds of the thin and colorless characters. I left the book for two hours, talking to itself, and when I came back and picked it up again, absolutely no progress had been made in plot or character development.Do you care a lot about what goes on inside small minds? If you do, this book's for you. If you don't, then read something that actually requires an IQ point to interpret. I'd rather get my teeth drilled than finish this book."
3,new??,I didn't think I was ordering this hardback copy from the secondary market but it came to me marked on the top/spine area and worn on the cover.Obviously not a new copy from Amazon.The Bearbooks copy I did receive was a good value for the money I paid but it was not a new copy.
2,Shipping,"I only gave it 2 stars - I contacted the shipper regarding my order and why it had not been received yet and I was replied to very quickly and informed that my order was shipped but may have been lost in the mail, however, my credit card was refunded promptly."
3,The Guardian,"I was disappointed with this Nicholas Spark's book... I usually love his books. This one was so boring (until you got to the end).Julie's husband died and left her a dog named Singer who became her guardian. Singer protected her when she began to date again. He always went after Richard Franklin. In the end, Singer proved himself and protected her when she discovered the strange behavior of Richard...Richard would not go away..."
3,I love a well developed dog character,"Though you pretty much get a pretty bad feeling about one of the main characters right off the bat, this book was still a fun read for me. I do love Nicholas Sparks and enjoy his books very, very much. The Wedding was one of my favorites. This book kept me going because of the dog. He cracks me up and really adds humor to the story."
5,Great Story about a Woman and her Dog!,"Another intense drama from Sparks that keeps you on the edge of your seat! This book has it all: romance, forgiveness, a great dog, and a little bit of fear to keep you hooked in!"
4,Good but not great.,I liked this book but I would not read it a second time. It is just very kinda plain expecially at the beginning of the book. I kinda wish I didn't purchase it and just borrowed it from someone or a library.
3,Good plot but...,"I read this book after reading ""A Walk To Remember"" and ""Nights in Rodanthe"" and having said that, I was a little disappointed with this one. It is still a great novel, don't get me wrong, but I felt that it was lacking, the end felt a bit rushed and I wasn't left with the same warm fuzzy kind of feeling I got after reading some of his other novels. A story about love overcoming obstacles is always good, but it was a little different to the Nicholas Sparks I was used to. However, it was a page turner and I couldn't put it down, I stayed up until three in the morning to finish it. The plot and characters were good and i would still recommend it, only if you want a different type of Nicholas Sparks book."
2,Predictable. Slow. Overdone.,"The only part I liked about this book was the Prologue. The rest was trash. Story started out extremely slow. And the storyline was extremely predictable. You've probably read something of this type, and better too. Don't waste your time."
1,Trite and Cliche-ridden,"Listening to this novel on public radio, I, too, was convinced that I was hearing some sort of savage satire. This book is written on about an 8th grade level, with all the cliches associated with that age. Please, someone, explain why anyone would find this garbage interesting or compelling?"
3,Sparks gives us a stalker,"I keep saying ""I don't like romance novels"". Yet I keep picking them up lately, with Nicholas Sparks holding my interest throughout both The Notebook (I cried) and The Rescue (I cried).This time, Sparks tries his hand at giving us a stalker. I enjoyed the change, and it really kept the book from having an unwarranted level of sappiness. Mostly I was fond of the friends-turned-lovers aspect, in which the prose had the ring of believability.I'm giving Sparks yet another go with Message in a Bottle. There. Now I've said it...maybe I DO like some romance novels!"
3,"Good read, but somewhat predictable","As with other Nicholas Sparks books, the setting is in the Carolinas, the descriptions of the trees, wildlife, etc are exactly the same, and the story line follows the same path as most books with minor changes. Literally on my Kindle when I've reached the 79% mark I know the resolution of the initial deception issue is coming. Really wish he'd change things up a bit."
1,I hate this book!,"This is a poorly written, simple book that might have been written by Danielle Steele (which would be ok if you like Danielle Steele). I am on page 90, and am struggling to get through it. The story is simple, the characters are completely flat. Mike, one of the main characters, who is vying for Julie's attentions, is written as such a simpleton that it's hard to root for him."
1,The Guardian- A big disappointment,"I did not like this book. As an animal lover and rescuer, I knew from the beginning that Singer, the devoted dog, would meet a horrible death. I cannot and will not read these types of books. I deal with this too much in everyday life. I skimmed the book until I finally came upon THAT part and then discarded the book in the trash. It is the first book by this author that I have not enjoyed or finished."
1,Very surprised,"I have read all of Nicholas' Sparks books and have enjoyed them, but I was very surprised..and annoyed as I kept on reading The Guardian. It reads like a cheap romance novel, very different from his earlier book. The Guardian is filled with common dialogues and there is not one single "" beautifullly written"" paragraph in this book. Too bad. I hope Mr. Sparks reads these reviews and starts to write seriously again."
2,Spoiler Alert,Don't read on if you don't want to know what happens!Come on.... really? the dog has to die? Not only die but be poisoned and shot twice then die!!Very disappointed.
1,Hated this book,"As soon as a dog is introduced into a book or movie, you can guarantee the dog WILL die. Disappointing book. I figured out what would happen as soon as she read the letter from her dead husband. THANK GOODNESS I didnt pay for this book, but I will tell the person who loaned it to me to keep her others. If she thought this was good, I dont want anymore."
3,Shouldn't a vinaigrette have vinegar?,"Generally, this book does a good job covering the class of sauces having an acid component, but I think the author could have done a better job compiling recipes of true vinaigrettes. Of the 60 recipes in the book, fully one third don't have vinegar as an ingredient; these generally use citrus juice as their acid. That's all well and good if you're just looking for a tangy dressing, but these definitely are not vinaigrettes. And while this probably isn't much of a failing if you're not a vinaigrette purist, the book has a few other failings as well.While most of the recipes are extremely simple, some are unnecessarily difficult to follow the first time through, and many of the ingredients are definitely beyond the pale of what is available at the average city market.The author does seem to have a good sense of flavor and offers many useful tips for how to create an effective sauce, but overall the book could have done a better job with the topic."
5,"Love salad, love this book","The recipes are simple and the results are perfectly balanced, chef quality vinaigrettes. The book is short and visually inviting. It is my go to book for dressing up the dinner every day. Friends love my salads and I give this book as gifts. I tend to keep my recipe book collection small, but to me, Dannenburg's book is a ""must have""."
5,DeWalt Metal Grinding Wheel,"I found this DeWalt General Purpose Metal Grinding Wheel to be outstanding in quality. It fit the grinder perfectly and worked very well (cut metal much faster than some other brands I have tried). Also, it doesn't wear out as quickly as some I've tried. The product was packed securely and shipped promptly. I highly recommend Amazon."
5,Monster Cable Is $$$,"Monster cable is not ""slightly"" more expensive. Expect to pay $60-$70 for the Monster cable, then another $40-$50 for their propriatary ""Lightwave"" Fiber Optic Cable (it won't use standard FiberOptic cables, so without this addon you can't use 5.1 Dolby Digital).However, on an HDTV with 5.1, the Xbox is simply beautiful. Was it worth the extra $120 I spent on Monster cables? Probabally not. Get this one and a $10 fiber optic cable and I'm sure you'll be just as happy."
3,Seems kinda expensive...,"With this, you will be spending atleast ... in order to get High Definition resolutions on your TV for your games and movies. I'd wait for a third party device to do the same thing. After all, Pelican is making a high definition cable set for the Gamecube for just ..., without the need to purchase any other cables."
3,If you have A lot of speaker wire and a receiver read me!!!!,"This is an awesome product and is well worth the $... Keep in Mind you get what you pay for. I have a lot of speaker wire and other cords around the back of my 47 inch (widescreen) HDTV. The second I turned the Xbox on the game/tv got all wacked out!!!!! BECAUSE THE CABLES ARE CHEAP! bottom line is this is well worth it and yes buy it if you do have an HDTV, but if you do have a lot of electronics you are going to need sheilded cables.I did get it to work with the cheap ones and it did look really nice........ But yes then it wacked out on me again."
2,I think I should have got the Monster HD Pack,"Although I'm absolutely impressed with the dolby digital 5.1 audio I got from this pack when I hooked it up to my amplifier, I'm not that impressed with the video it delivers in 1080i (and 720p) modes on my TV. I notice several dead pixel areas on the screen that tend to move around. I don't think the problem is with the pack itself (or the xbox), but with the cheapy cables that came with it. I think they are the cause of the problem I'm seeing. I guess I should have expected that for 20 bucks. So, I'll probably still need to drop another 30 to 40 bucks on better shielded component video cables to get the picture clean.Bottom line: If I could do it all over again I would have given the Monster product a shot first!"
3,The description of the items in the box,"I am writing this review because the image of the XBOX High Def is not what you would receive in the mail. What you would get is a fat cable which one side connects to XBOX on the other side you will get 5 cables, 3 for component input and 2 for stereo audio. On the fat side connected to XBOX there is a digital audio connection also known as fiber optic or TOS link. This cable is not included, and I would recommend Monster THX if you have a good system. I hope this review clarifies for others what I had to learn through experience. Judging by the images I ordered a COAX cable, which I will be returning as it is of no use with this system. Last but not least, www.buy.com sells this pack as well as the monster wires cheaper. Amazon is slow on shipping this pack through gamestop as well as the cables them selves with their cheap but super long shipping."
3,Oh great another extra,"I can't believe microsoft didn't include actual cables with their high definition adapter, argh. :("
1,HDTV.. Yeah Right,"Look folks. HDTV is 720P or 1080i. 480i is 240P, what your current TV is capable of putting out. You would be best hook up the S-VHS to a good monitor with Upconversion and 3:2 pull down. You can't make something better that isn't. These game companies can talk to me when they begin making at least a 720P game. Until then, I'll be content with Standard Definition. Then again, most of these games are available on the PC which can be hooked up to an HDTV with at least 540P, which has got to be better than any console. Save your cash, there's no improvement here."
4,Note: It has to be turned on,"Many of the people who gave this a bad rating sound like they didn't read the instructions. To activate the HDTV modes, you must go to Settings and Video in the Dashboard. Then you must say that your TV supports 420p, 720p, and/or 1080i. This can only be done when using the HD AV Pack."
3,Invest a little more in a Monster Cable,"If you have a HDTV, you're better off with the Monster Cable for XBOX, a little more expensive but you'll have to buy a HD cable anyway with this one and besides, the Monster cable enables a direct conection from XBOX to TV, reducing the posible noise of this adapter due to bridging two cables. Either way it's the best quality display for XBOX. The same applies for the S-Video adapter."
1,terrible and unmoving,this book made no impact on me. it was horribly written and did not give an okay description of anything. i hated reading it.
1,Crashed,"I bought this one, it lasted 2 1/2 years. I couldn't even refomat it after the crash. I didn't rma to get another one, since I had personal information on it. It was warranted for 3 years. I am not sureit when you rma it, you get back a new one or another one refurbushed."
2,Disappointing flight,Opened my fathers day present and was looking forward to a flight with Dominator airplane. Very poor control response and the plane suffered styrofoam damage the first time it crashed landed...we used aerosal glue spray to repair the fusalage and wings but each flight had the same results. This airplane is uncontrollable and self-destructs on crash-landings. Dont see any value in this unless a person turns the plane into a model and leaves it on a shelf for the grand-kids to admire.
3,Reilly's review,It was fun the first day until I crashed it into a fense and it broke the styrofoam. The next day it was kind of dull. My first flight went well but my second flight it went out of control and I lost it in a tree. I suggest you get a different plane than the Dominator.
2,you sould not get it!,"I wasted my money by getting this toy. this toy looks like it is plastic but it is not it is stiraphone.it will brake easyily. my opinon is not to get this toy.this toy will go up but everything that goes up must come down,and yes it does come down hard.when it hits the ground a little pieces brake off. it also dies fast."
2,Fun....but tuff to controll,"I got this toy a day ago, I took it out to fly it and I was having fun until it started going straight and I was using the controller to make it go right and it just kept going straight. Then after it went straight for a while, it just started to go in circles and I couldn't controll it. Then it just crashed. It was fun until i lost controll"
2,A Toy that's not worth to buy,"At first I thought I'm stupid and makes it can't fly and crashed and broken in the first fly. But other reviewers proof i'm not the only one.Problem:1.It can't turns right2.Need extra money to buy strong glue to repair the crashed pieces3.Other people will see you as a foolSuggestions:1.Don't first/2/3/4/5... fly in front of your friends, you'll be shame forever2.Need to tape all the edge to avoid it crashed into pieces3.The field must have long grass ONLY, if there's trees, you need to bring ladder.Or climb like a monkey,like me4.when it goes too far, MUST turn off the R/C rather than keep on controlling it"
3,ok..... not really,well i bought this for my friends birthday and the next day i came over and we went to a field and started to fly it. WARNING LANDING SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! as u can see the lands is horrible but it can fly for a good amount of time. but if u even try to land it it will twirl in the air and go head first into the ground. I would not buy it
4,Best flying RC plane yet!,"After my nephew saw the Dominator commercial he was dying for a Dominator. So I bought it. Well out of all the RC planes I've tried, this has been the easiest to learn. You can't miss it in the sky since the plane body is huge and the control is reasonable for the price. Compared to the other stealth looking planes in the stores, this by far was the best in price. Overall, my nephew adored the plane, it provided a decent time period of flight. I recommend purchasing this plane for any child who likes RC products and outdoor fun. Great plane!"
2,"cheap, kinda fun, but reallllly cheap.",hard to fly. takes alot of practice and breaks very easily. the box should tell you your paying 35 bucks for styrofoam.
5,My only yoga DVD,"I am an intermediate yoga student, and practice about 3 or 5 times/week. This is my one and only yoga DVD. If I don't go to a class, and I dont' just do yoga on my own, this DVD is on the TV. It is an excellent 80 minutes, although I don't normally do the entire tape. Usually I watch just half of it, which is fine.The beginning is quite gentle, while the second half is more advanced. It is vigorous, with pauses between poses to ""reflect"" on the pose. Attention is paid to alignment, and doing the pose correctly. The students in the video are of different ages, and ethnicities, which is great. No 20 yr old hard bodies; these folks are real."
5,This Tire Gel works like magic to shine and protect my new Tires,I was wondering how the professional detailers shine and protect the rubber tires of their show vehicles and this product is the answer. It's polymer formula cleans and protects brand new tires and gives them the showroom shine like new tires should look. Highly recommended.
4,"NASB Ministers Bible, a great Sword for the LORD.","This Bible is fantastic. This is the perfect Bible for the new Minister. It holds well in your hand and does not become cumbersome. The cover is good quality leather and the binding is great quality as I have a lot of other Bibles that separate at the binding when you fold them. I would recommend this bible to anyone whom does external services as wedding, funerals, etc as there is an excellent collection of ceremonies. This Bible is a great sword for the LORD."
5,"AL TERMINAR EL TRABAJO DEL DÍA,",TODOS TRATAMOS DE TOMAR UN DESCANSO FÍSICO... PERO EL RELAJAMIENTO EMOCIONAL ES MUY IMPORTANTE...Y este hermoso libro REAL es el MEJOR INSTRUMENTO PARA HACERNOS DESCANSAR EL ALMA...PRECIOSO !MAS DE 50 HISTORIAS REALES QUE TE REFRESCAN EL CORAZÓN Y EL ESPIRITU !
3,Track listing,1. Post Modern Sleaze (video mix)2. Post Modern Sleaze (Flight From Nashville)3. Post Modern Sleaze (The Salt Lake City Orchestra Nightclub mix edit)4. Call out research hook #15. Call out research hook #2
3,Gospel Album,This a good gospel album. Not the best video or sound quality. Young Al Green doing a gospel concert with Al type flair. I thought that I had finally found an Al Green R&B concert. Still looking for that!
1,Al green,None of his big hits were played. Preacher al just preached through most of the DVD. Not what I expected
4,Happy Grandson,"My grandson loves Spiderman, Venom and all of the other characters. He was happy to get this dvd and has watched it a few times before his nap. The price was good and I don't have any complaints."
3,Not a Movie Experiance Apparently:,"I'm sure these little cartoons are fine most of the time. However, my Grandson had only seen the Movies and he had a funny look on his face when this cartoon started and it didn't hold his interest very long. Product seems fine for what it is. The price is right and should hold the interest of most of the tiniest Spiderman fans :-)"
2,This Is No Goblin!,"The entire series is disappointing. They always screw up Spider-Man's history. Using lasers instead of guns? Come on, buddy! It's New York! Also, Hobgoblin didn't come first and that was not ever Hobby's identity. The producer said he loved Spider-Man and he knew so much about him. Oh please! He wouldn't know how the original Green Goblin died even if it bit him on the a$$!"
1,A forgettable doc with decent picture quality.,"Too boring. I have never made it past the 20 min mark. For blu, the vid is low quality too."
5,Excellent!,"What did u get in the mail? these are the best towels!!! I hate cheap, non-absorbent towels. These are colorful, beautiful, NOT cheap, wonderful towels!"
2,Disappointed!,This brand was the best kitchen towel...in the past! The ones I recently ordered don't absorb the water after washing you hands or drying a dish:(
1,Worst Kitchen Towels Ever Used,"I am a chef on a private yacht and these are by far the worst kitchen towels I have ever used.We have two sets, one in black and one in the taupe color, and neither are absorbent. Instead they seem to spread the water around when you are attempting to dry any item. The black also gives of huge amounts of lint all over the white china and glassware, making it necessary to wipe them again with paper towels to remove the lint. I have heard nothing but complaints about these towels from the rest of the crew on board, so these have got to go!I'll be looking for towels with more consistent reviews from now on, and focus on function instead of brand name or style. Look somewhere else for good towels! I would give these towels ZERO stars if possible."
2,"Water, water, everywhere",This is a great looking towel but it does not absorb water. It simply spreads it around. Isn't that what a towel is for to clean up spills??
1,Falling apart on day 1,I'm a very picky person and I've had terrible luck finding a kitchen towel that won't shed.I listened to the positive reviews and bought 4.As soon as I took them out of the plastic I noticed that threads were dangling off of the towels.I put them through the washer (cold water) and dryer (medium heat) and still black fuzzies are falling off. I tried using them to dry off my kitchen counter and it left a black streak.I wouldn't recommend this product.
1,don't waste your money!,The worst absorbing towel ever! Looks great but doesn't do the job. You wipe your hands on them and they're still wet. The same for drying dishes....worthless
3,Good Lesser Known Release,"Wow, I just scored a sealed 8 Track Tape of this release in pristine shape that to my ears sounds as good as a CD,maybe fuller!! The tunes are a little simpler than some of the earlier Steppenwolf, but still decent. This is more than contractual obligation as another viewer stated. There is an attempt to branch out stylistically. There's even a reggae rocker. I also tend to seek out lesser known releases by classic rock bands. If you listened to classic rock radio, you'd think this great band had only two worthwhile songs. Steppenwolf was a strong hard rock act in their day, and Skullduggery shows John Kay as a quality mature songwriter."
2,Steppenwolf's Contractual Obligation,"After two albums with Epic, the Wolf was winding down but had to go back to do this album for contractual reasons. There's very few good moments here like ""Skullduggery"" and ""Road Runner"" the latter dates back some time, even so that Goldy McJohn appears on it. It's got it's place in the collections of hardcore fans and completists only."
3,Adequate camera,"We have a really nice $400 Kodak digital camera that my husband bought for work. It holds hundreds of photos and they are crystal clear. This camera is definitely not that. We bought this for my daughter's 10th birthday; it is fine for what she wants to do, though she thought the photos were not very sharp when she viewed them on the computer. Also, she has trouble getting the photos to be light enough, even though they look fine through the viewer. It only holds 16 photos and some more in favorites, but 16 is not enough for a vacation. We will look into adding memory. She likes her camera, and again, it is fine for a young person who just wants to snap photos of her friends or a family trip."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I bought this camera for my mom for Christmas. She is finally using it, but has found that it does not take good pictures when it is slightly dark. Even inside in a fairly lit room, the pictures are not as good as I would expect. I'm going to see if there is another camera that works with the dock, cause the prints turn out nice when the pic is well lit. I'll just upgrade the camera (I hope!)"
1,Poor Kodak Customer Service,I purchased the Kodak C310 and Printer Dock and the camera would not immediately charge when taken out of the box. We contacted Kodak and they said we had to return the camera and printer dock back to the dealer. I had to pay all shipping and handling costs and Kodak said it was their policy not to refund the return of defective equipment to the customer. This camera costs me additional $20 because Kodak does not accept responsiblity for selling defective equipment. I could have bought a more expensive camera for the additional expense it cost me for buying a Kodak camera.
2,Pleased for awhile,"The Koadk Easyshare C310 worked for about 2 months, then after each picture I took it shut off. I have changed the batteries over a million times, and it still doesn't work. So, I took it back and got an MP3 player instead."
5,Great Camera,"I've been using this camera since September, so that is approximately 3 months now. It is a great camera. Takes great pictures, uploads them quickly to the computer and does everything I need it to do."
1,Bad news,"I bought this camera new and on the 4th time I went to use it, it did not work. After several times to unsuccessfully change batteries, I phoned the Kodak service repair. They were unable to help troubleshoot and asked me to send $69.00 plus shipping and the camera for them to look at and repair if possible. I asked to talk to a supervisor but their response was ""they are too busy"". Why would I spend $69.00 on a camera that costs less than $100 and not even know if it is repairable. I wouldn't wish this camera on the most unfortunate person.I will never buy another Kodak product because of this. There are too many other good products out there. Buyer beware!"
2,Not worth it,"This camera is NOT worth it. I recieved it for christmas and it is awful. The batteries that came with the camera only lasted for about 15 pictures, and since they weren't rechargable, they had to be thrown away. I then went and bought recharable batteries and they only last for up to 10 pictures. So basically if I want to use it, I have to carry around five sets of double A batteries. It is also a lot fatter than it looks in the picture so it is not easy to carry around. When it does work, the pictures are decent but it does horrible in low lighting. Disposable cameras are better than this and I do NOT recommend this product. Spend the extra 50 bucks for something good."
3,One size fits all Amazon,"You can't purchase this product if you have an APO box. Don't bother. If it can be connected to an electrical outlet, Amazon won't ship it. Sort of a shotgun approach to retail, but that is Amazon these days. I tried to buy a UV filter for my camera, but because it falls within a particular category, Amazon is too blinded to differentiate. Sad. Hire a few more starving programmers to set up a better filter."
5,Kodak Easy Share C310,"The Kodak Easy Share is A very good camera for the beginner.The camera is very simple to use,light weight and small enough to carry anywhere.Just as simple to down load to your computer"
2,missing cables and will not take sd card,"I was recently shopping for a digital camera and this one seemed to meet the means.Upun opening I discorcered the usb cord to the computer was missing and could make no other fit. Then I tryed putting in an sd card and it said it needed formamting ,which it did not format I tryed others with the same result.I don't know if it was a bad camerea or dealer neglect."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I did not get the item I ordered, the seller has very poor customer service and is non-responsive."
2,Serious battery problems,"Camera worked absolutly wonderful until the batteries that it came with ran out. Since then I have purchased various other AA brands with the same results. Rechargable, top of the line, kodak brand it doesn't matter. Camera shuts off after about 2 minutes of use each time. I then have to take out the batteries and reinsert to get another 2 minutes. The kodak brand was the only brand of batteries I could get to do even this. sorta of a ripoff because by the time I discovered this problem I had already thrown away the packaging and receipt, so return is not an option. After a bit of research I have also confirmed that this is a pretty common problem. This is the sort of camera that people with tight budgets are going to buy when they want something a little nicer. So I wanted to inform people that they may not get what they paid their hard earned money for. Think seriously and perhaps buy another brand. Good luck."
4,Great for my 8 year old,"I bought this camera for my 8 year old daughter who loves to take pictures. It has worked well for her doing all the things she wants it to. I think it was easy for her to learn to use it. Two days after Christmas we did replace the batteries (I am sure b/c it was used so much due to the novelty) Since then, we have not changed the batteries. She is happy with the purchase and so am I especially for the price."
1,dumpy flick,"To begin with, this dvd was incorrectly listed. I thought I was ordering a movie with Daniel J Travanti. There was no picture to serve as a guide. A ""kung fu"" type movie arrived. I did attempt to view it and pass it along as a charitable donation. Unfortunately, the nudity ruined things, and I stopped it. It wasn't worth passing along as a donation.Turns out the movie I wanted was re-titled ""Tagget""-probably to avoid this duplication."
5,THIS IS THE MOST AWSOME GAME EVER!!!,"My family has played this game hundreds of times, and we have still havent gotten tired of it. It NEVER plays the same twice (meaning you will never have a game that ends the same or plays the same) and it is fun for the whole family! This game is an absolute MUST HAVE for this christmas season. Every child will spend hours playing this awsome game! Enjoy!!!!!!!!"
5,A Blast!,Everything was crazy noisy until the Sevinpold game was opened. The gameplay was a blast and 4 of us ages 8 to adult could only be pryed away with threats of banishment and offers of food! So many gooood twists and turns. We played over and over and over. Superb fun!
4,Sounds a bit odd...,"... from the Candlemass I remember and love. What should have struck me as obvious, when I later found out, is that this album was originally meant to be ""Abstract Algebra 2"", a second album of Leif Edling's highly experimental album, Abstrakt Algebra. This is not as good as AA nr 1, nor can it really compare to the old Candlemass, but it still contains a lot of the old gloom & doom. Singer Björn Flodqvist does a good job, but, let's be fair, he's not Messiah Marcolin or Tomas Vikström. Of the songs, I Still See the Black and Dustflow stand out, though the rest aren't at all bad. I'd say this album takes a few listenings to fully get a grip on. So, listen to it! It's worth it."
2,An U-turn in Candlemass's sound,"If you like the old good sound of Candlemass (4 first albums), then you should have second thoughts about buying this one!"
5,I Was There...!,"This book has it all. Great photos, delightful drawings and a story that had me up late at night turning pages. I was there. I worked at Disney, but I did not know the emotional detail or the heartbreaking history of a young woman climbing up out of the broken beginnings of her life. The humor sears like a blow torch! Wait till you see the drawing of her step mother.....! It's better than Cruella Devill. Working at Disney in those days was definately a world apart. Ms. Guedel brings it all to life."
3,Okay I guess,I have been anxious about learning how to cook faster because of my busy schedule. I heard a lot about Rachel's tapes and bought 3 or 4. After reviewing them I really didn't learn anything new. The meals weren't that interesting but it was nice to finally see what her show was about. Maybe if I tuned in more I would get something productive from the tapes/show. I won't buy another cooking video but I will keep looking for a book to meet my needs. So overall I guess it was okay... nothing to jump for joy about.SIDEBAR: The Fasta Pasta Microwave Container was GREAT!! It became our life saver. Now that item is worth singing about. Include it with your quick microwave cooking arsenal and you are set. GREAT INVENTION.
4,Rednightengale,"This is a nice DVD that shows Rachel Ray in her earlier days making some meals. It's just like her tv program. She makes one complete meal thru the course of the program. I bought it because I thought she was demonstrating the ""Fasta Pasta"" pasta microwave container. It wasn't that at all. So don't confuse it with the other product sold under the same name...which is an excellent product in its own right. I will keep the DVD because it is a nice demo of a meal plan for entertaining or just serving your family and friends. I liked it alot, but was disappointed it didn't show her using the Fasta Pasta pasta maker."
4,Awesome but,I love this game. It's pretty awesome. I don't believe it's worth 120 dollars though. You could get it at a used game store for 30 dollars or less. Jeez...
3,For my son,"He did not request this for Christmas, but I thought he'd like it. He played it a while, but he beat it quickly."
1,This is NOT tear free!,"Twice in the past week my five year old has gotten this shampoo in his eyes, with crying, screaming, and redness being the result. If you're thinking of buying it for its tear-free capability, think again!"
2,Nothing New!!,"I am returning to costa rica for the third time, and bought this book thinking there would be some deep researched information that may reveal hidden secrets that I had not yet explored. I was wrong. The book provides little information that a travelling surfer (one that really surfs) doesn't already know, or really needs. If you like for your entire trip to be scheduled before hand this book will provide you the information to do so. Good only for the first time surfer Costa Traveller without an internet connection or hasn't discovered google."
4,Read This BEFORE You Plan Your Trip,"I've been surfing Costa Rica for 9 years and bought one of the earliest published versions of this book. While growth was slow and things weren't changing quickly, the book was very good. Now, the book gets outdated almost as soon as it goes to print.The book gives accurate information on all of the major breaks in CR, even though it does leave out some of the out of the way places. (I gave the book an extra star for that.)If you are looking for information on places to stay at the different breaks, the book is marginal, due to the changing conditions, but if you use it to plan your trips to different breaks, it's worth the price."
2,Fusion Ain't Always Good,"I just try to be straight with my reviews...i really didn't like this CD. Fusion doesn't always work, and in this case, i think the attempt to mix cuban music and cajun music failed. In fact, even when I've seen them live Cubanismo is far better when they stick to cuban music...their rap, cajun, calypso and other experiments just don't work for me at least. So, if you like the otehr Cubanismo CD's, don't get this one, ya probably won't like it."
2,Never again.,"I am a huge Cubanismo fan. I live in Baltimore, MD. I have seen them at Wolftrap,in Richmond, in Deleware, and even here in B-more. My buddy and I anxiously awaited the release of Mardi Gras Mambo. Expecting to hear that unsurpassed Cubanismo sound.... we were GREATLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! Where are the strong solos that only Alemany can produce? The outstanding arrangements we have come to know and love? This would be a great cd from any other band. It however doesn't come close to the standard set by Cubanismo's usually sizziling sound."
3,Great concept in theory but....,"I am a big fan of Jesus Alemany and Cubanismo. Whenever they perform in the New York City area I am always there to support them. I have seen them countless times and have all their CD's.The concept of blending Cuban rhythms with music from (the cradle) New Orleans is a good one in theory, but in my opinion the results are mixed. When it works it is very good. The problem is it doesn't always work!I take nothing away from Cubanismo, I think they are one of the hottest and most professional bands on the Latin music scene today and I applaud their willingness to try out new concepts and material. All bands who are worth their salt do this.Obviously, there are die hard Cubanismo fans who will disagree with my thoughts. Just this once, we can agree to disagree. Can't wait to see what Cubanismo will come up with next! They are still one of my favorite bands."
4,excellent,"If you are one who cares about genre, Shazaam may be one of the first power pop albums.The Move here take heavy but melodic guitars and apply the Mozart like beauty of the Beatles. They also make the classical element the fab four brought to rock and make this more consious. Listen to the fat cello on ""Beatuiful Daughter,"" and how the spare but distinct sound of the instrument creates the song's backbone.Many of the musicans here formed ELO, but the Move's arrangements are not nearly as big and this is less overtly classical than the Electric Light was.Still, for fine orchestral pop with rock ambition, you can't find better than this underrated band."
5,oops - this isn't Tom Jones!,"I wanted to share my knowledge of the Move's Shazam with anyone odd enough to check it out, but certainly no one will find it listed under Tom Jones. But, hey, if you've come here thinking you've found an obscure Tom Jones album, why not really stretch yourselves, ladies, and acquire a real mind-blowing experience, probably as titilating in it's own way as Tom's chest."
4,Psychadelic when psychadelic was psychadelic,"Very good arrangements with some good guitarwork. When most think of psychadelic music one thinks of weird, druginduced melodic ""noise"", but this band was at the forfront of said movement and, they did it with taste."
3,Bev was no Keith Moon,"I first heard the Move when the venerable Scott Muni teed up the original ""Do Ya"" back in '72. I immediately bought the Move's US release ""Split Ends"" (since discontinued), featuring ""Do Ya"", ""Tonight"", ""California Man"" and most of the Message from the Country album. I wore out needles playing it. I then went in search of the three albums in the back catalog.Shazam is schizophrenic. The Roy Wood side A is quirky and dated, although ""Your Beautiful Daughter"" did show Carl Wayne actually had some talent. Best thing he's done. And while the A side can be fun, I have to agree with the Jim Nabors post below. Bev's drumming was distracting. Surprisingly to me, the B side covers have held up over time.The liner notes from Roy Wood's 'Singles' indicate that ""Hello Susie"" was a chart hit for some other band in the 60's. I'd love to hear that sometime to see if the drumming is any better."
2,Not as good as the LP,"The original vinyl LP release on A&M and Regal Zonophone is a sonic masterpiece, full of fun, heavy intricate music running the gamut from psychedilia, hard rock, pop balladry, raga and great hints of what would become Electric Light Orchestra. Unfortunately, I cannot seriously recommend this Repertoire release as the sound on the compact disc is heavily compromised, almost lifeless, and some of those live bits on Great Portland Street and in the studio have been mysteriously edited out. Better to search out the Japanese version. As for the live extras, better to save your money for the current Sanctuary label's Something Else From The Move ... Plus or wait later in the year for the upcoming Live At The Marquee which will include the long lost Fillmore West concert as well as a more complete version of the Marquee concert featuring the original quintet."
4,The Newest Beaux Arts Trio,"This newest incarnation of the Beaux Arts Trio does an excellent job with these trios. To me, the performance is only slightly bettered by the older recording with Greenhouse and Cohen. This may be because of my love for the Greenhouse cello sound. It certainly doesn't hurt to have both recordings and Pressler's performance in both is amazing."
5,great camera,We just purchased this camera 2 weeks ago. i am amazed at what great pictures it takes.It is so easy to use and very easy to get pictures from card. So far we love it.We took the advice of a friend that owns a camera shop. He is sold on the fuji.
2,Not Happy,"I am a long time Fuji fan, starting with a 35mm film camera. My next camera was a FinePix 2300, which served me well and with which I have taken over 11,000 photos. Looking for something a little better, I next purchased an A310. This camera has never given me the sharp and clear pictures that I get with the 2300, and I have never been happy with the camera. I love the little xD picture cards and I really like the cradle, but I sure do not like the camera. At the present time the A310 is retired and I am using the 2300.Bob GussmanHouston and Costa Rica"
4,One of the best in it's class,"Pictures are worth a 1000 words. Please see the pictures in my photo gallery (www.people.umass.edu/nishanth/ ) which I took with FinePix A310 at 1MP setting.+ Points:It doesn't drain the batteries quickly as others.Crystal clear pictures.Extreme close-up and long range shots with equal ease.Light, compact and elegant.High quality 6 MP prints.Equipped with almost all functions which you can ever need.Easy picture management software.The only defect I can find is the lack of an UV filter.I strongly recommend its purchase."
2,Disappointment - Image Noise,"The Finepix A310 was a disappointment to say the least. I got an excellent deal on the camera but because of it's image noise, the camera suited no purpose. I read the reviews regardin the noise, but assumed it was an exaggeration. It was no exaggeration. Do not purchase this camera if you are going to use it to take pictures (AKA: Don't buy this camera) The image noise and blurriness in pictures will disappoint you. In my testing I compared the image noise of this camera to that of a Finepix 2650 (2MP), Nikon 2100 (2MP), and Canon Powershot A70 (3MP). In all these cases, the Finepix A310 faired far worse. I have returned my Finepix A310 for a Canon PowerShot A70. Couldn't be happier."
2,From OK to DOA,"I got this camera 6 months ago as an ""upgrade"" to my previous Fuji. I was happy with it for the first months but over the last month the quality of the images got horrible (to say the least). Now I can't take pictures at night or with low light. I will stand 3-4 feet away from the target and the picture won't come out right. I don't think it has to do with the flash, since some pictures taken at daytime are coming out washed out, too. I've also noticed some red lines in some of the images. What else can I tell you? I'm writing this review while I'm researching for a new camera."
1,Got no strings on me,"This might better have been titled ""The Columbia Studio Stringswith Marian McPartland."" What an awful thing to do to a talentedJazz trio circa 1957. Why someone felt compelled to reissue thisis beyond me."
3,Cute but would be better in glass,"It's a good product, but I could see the bottom getting looser as you take it off to fill it. (It just pushes into place). Otherwise it's fine."
5,Great feeder!,"My hummingbirds, and I have many, love it. They rest and can eat at same time. Thanks for the interesing balloon feeder."
1,Don't buy this product.,This was a waste of money. It leaked sugar water all over the deck and I couldn't even use it. I saw some of the reviews saying it leaked but I wanted to give it a try because I liked the balloon. I should have trusted the reviews. Don't buy this with plans of using it as a humming bird feeder - it leaks like crazy. I'm trying to find a way I can use this as a garden decoration. Very disappointing! Wish I could give it less than one star.
2,missing parts,"The bird feeder came with no perches, it was shown to have attaced white perches.By the time I realized that I had already thrown away the boxes etc. NOT HAPPY!"
1,Worked fine at first....,I bought two of them and they worked fine at first but eventually they started leaking. Which brought the ants. I would stay away from these and get something more sturdy.
5,good service,Original shipment / feeder was broken; replaced immediately next day ship! And the birds love this feeder!
1,Leaks like a sieve,"When I wrote the first review I hadn't actually used the feeder yet. It leaks like a sieve and I'm left holding the bag because the return policy is only for one month.Go to Walmart, they're much cheaper and better looking.This feeder is a good size and attractive but it's just a matter of time until the plastic holder on top breaks. It's not a really good deal either, I've seen cheaper ones that are nicer."
5,Happy Hummers,"Excellent product for hummingbirds and their slaves. Instead of filling 3 X a day, I can do it every other day. Items were delivered promptly and work well. Excellent service."
4,great for the value,We have had this for almost a full year. We see tons of hummingbirds (and some ants) attracted to this.It has been outside all year and is not fading in color (California weather).My son loves the birds it attracts.
5,Balloon Hummingbird Feeders,"These little hummingbird feeders are great! I've been able to get the same ones for over 15 years now. I had trouble finding them again until I went on Amazon.com. Simple, fast and efficient service. They were at my door in only a few days. Thanks!"
5,great feeder,Have had this type feeder before. We liked them so much that we bought two more. We only wish that the bottom parts were as durable as the top globe. uv rays seem to deteriated the plastic base and cracking happens after a few years. All in all they are great feeders and our hummers seem to love them.
1,artline ballon &strawberry ballon,bought both of them and both leak i waisted my money cup as 2 parts they snap on not screw on thts the problem
3,Great Album,"This is a great album. Amerie is a refreshing voice out of the polluted pool of the what is now called R&B. Her confident voice and great vocal range drives this entire CD from open to close. The title cut is the real Amerie. Ashanti, move over, there's a new princess of R&B."
3,Nice Attempt,"I went out on a limb when I bought this album, having very low expectations. However, the songs soon began to grab me, esp. ""I Just Died"", ""Can't Let Go"", and ""Float"". Although her vocals didn't really impress me, this album was still a nice attempt by a new artist."
4,great and fabolous voice,the best album rnb i've ever heard when i first listened why dont we fall in love i was wauuuuuuu whos this and i finnaly know it was amerie ashanti its nothing compared wit ameriebest tracks-talkin tomme-why dont we fall in love-just died-and its not in the album im coming out a classsic song
2,Unfortunately repetitiveness out weighs the good,"Her first two singles are probably the best songs on the album. Don't get me wrong, I think she's good but truth is she can be way better, unlike most,Amerie actually has the vocal ability (not to mention supermodel looks) that will ensure her the time to improve on this mediocre debut. But maybe this was a good place for her to start, hopefully with her second album she will stop the repetitiveness that takes over ""all I have"" perhaps my biggest complaint for this album, the only standout track is ""talkin' to me""-the reason i bought this cd. That song is a nice easy going song that i can feel and it really displays her vocal ability. LAST WORD: Amerie I luv ya but you can do better. please."
4,Great album!,"Very talented young woman, with a voice that reminds me of SWV's Cheryl ""coko"" Gamble. Album worth the money."
5,Great from start 2 finish!!!!,"Amerie is an underlooked star that could be put into competion withAaliyah, Monica, and Ashanti. Her album is great and deserves more than 5 stars. All she need is more promotions from her record label."
3,Strong Debut,"Something about Amerie as a performer keeps her from standing out among the rest. We haven't had a chance to feel her as a person which, sadly, will keep her from advancing because her album is decent. When it came out, I didn't expect much even though I really liked the sound of ""Why Don't We Fall in Love?"" Some of the songs have a similar feel making them seem like one continuous track but on the bright side, the feel is easy going and enjoyable. Unlike some others, she does have a nice voice so when her lyrics mature with a little bit more soul and emotion then we'll have a talented star on our hands."
4,Beautiful Cd,AMERIE HAS A VERY NICE ALBUM FOR A 1ST TIMER..GOOD JOB!WHY DONT WE FALL IN LOVE-****TALKIN TO ME-****NOTHING LIKE LOVIN YOU-***1/2CAN'T LET U GO-****1/2NEED YOU TONIGHT-*****GOT TO BE THERE-****1/2I JUST DIED-****1/2HATIN ON YOU-***FLOAT-****SHOW ME-****ALL I HAVE-*****OUTRO-*****
4,UNDER-RATED ( period ) A true R&B Princess,"I'm so mad at myself for just finding out about this young lady who is beautiful and has vocal talent and brains also. She Attended Georgetown University and Graduated also completing what i call R & B!!! Favorite tracks are I just died- she sings (so softly so softly I just died)BEAUTIFUL! She reminds me alot of Aaliyah on that track and on ""Float"". Her new album is coming out really soon titled ""Touch"". I CAN NOT WAIT!! Check this album out."
2,Not the best CD in the world,"I didn't like most of the songs on there because they were too slow. I like a slow song once in a while, but these were TOO slow. The only good songs on there are ""Why Don't We Fall In Love,"" ""Talkin' To Me,"" and ""Hatin' On You."" Other then those the CD was really bad."
4,Excellent First CD!,"this AIN'T your kids' cd! this cd is definately geared towards the 25 and up crowd. waaaayyyy too mature for the teeny-boppers yet still hip, urban and fresh enough for those of us not too far outside the teen category. a combination of mellow and upbeat tracks to chill with at the crib(oops my 12 year old said you dont say ""chill"" or ""crib"" anymore! sorry...) or ride to. definately one to get."
5,amerie all i have is hot,all the songs are great she has more soft melodies on her album but its still good her album is better than ashanti and tweets she can really sing if you liked why dont we fall in love you will like the rest of the album specially talkin to me
4,Better Than Expected,"Amerie has a beautiful, gentle voice. I didn't like her first single that much, but when I heard TALKIN' TO ME, I knew I had to have this album. Her vocals are very assured and she can go high and low and sound just as good unlike another songstress **cough**Ashanti**cough** My favorite tracks are TALKIN' TO ME, NOTHING LIKE LOVING YOU, I JUST DIED, HATIN' ON YOU, FLOAT, and SHOW ME. A must have for any R&B fanatic."
2,It's not that great,"""Why don't we fall in love"" is a great song, but for me this album fails to continue the excitement that track instills within. ""Talkin to me"" isn't bad, in fact the entire album isn't bad, it's just that, it's not that great either. The most annoying thing about this LP is that you can tell it was entirely produced by the same person. Amerie is such a great talent, I hope next time she really brings the heat. She deserves more than the 2 1/2 stars I think All I have should get."
2,**Kinda Weak**,"Yeah, ""Why Don't We Fall in Love"" has a tight hook, but that's all it is...3 minutes of chorus. ""Nothing Like Loving You"" and ""I Just Died"" are the best tracks on the cd. Don't get me wrong, the girl can sing, but for the most part, the lyrics and the beats are weak. ..."
2,Is this really all Amerie has?,"Let's hope for the sake of Amerie future career that this mediocre CD isn't all she has. The best song on the CD is the single ""Why Don't We Fall in Love?"" a brief, catchy single. It, unfortunately, is one of only three songs I could listen to a lot on the CD. The rest of Amerie's material is uninteresting R&B with formulaic beats. It all blends together as the CD continues until it actually becomes difficult to tell when a song change occurs. It's a shame because she has a nice, breezy voice. Get her a better producer for her next album."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a waste of money. Amerie can not sing, and is just about as talentless as Ashanti is. I got the import CD thinking that all the songs would be good, but they are just as awful. I don't think this CD or her even need one star, but that is just my opinion."
1,Wish I didn't have It !,"I am sorry but this cd does not do It for me.I think the mary j thing has been done and should be left alone.I bought this cd based on the reviews I had read and hoped for more but got less.I was hoping It would grow on me, but now there seems there Is no chance of that!Overall, a weak cd with better material next time she will be a artist worth checking out, but for this one STAY AWAY!"
4,Ashanti betta move out the way,"Nicely arranged album with heartfelt lyrics. This young lady is talented...what Ashanti lacks...Talent.She has a lil bit of Mary's flava and for a first album with a hit, ""why can't we fall in love."" She is not another one hit wonder."
4,what's the 4-1-1? almost this!,"i'm sorry, but mary j. aint been the mary j. that i prefer... i like mary better with some drama! whats wrong with some good ol fashion drama anyway???and for that matter, what is wrong with some good ol fashion passion!!?? amerie is very reminiscent of ol-school mary j. bringin us that devoid-of-real-issues-summer-love-fun... i aint got no problem with that... (will i be playin this cd late into the year? - proly not, but in the warmer months? yes!!)an excellent debut!"
5,Amerie's Debut Album,"Amerie has done an excellent job on her debut album. Her first up beat sultry single ""Why Don't We Fall In Love"" was a hit. Her song ""Talkin To Me"" has a cool blend of pop and R&B. Overall, every song on this album is good. I would definitely recommend this album to fans of R&B contemporary."
4,All I have,"I think this cd is really good. Amerie has a wonderful voice. I think this cd was underated. This is a cd that you pop in to relax to. Most of the songs are about love, and heartache. With my fav song being "" Nothing like loving you""."
3,It's,"While Amerie has yet to prove to me and a whole bunch of other people that she can sing live, I must admit that she tore the house down on this one.At it's very worst, ""All I Have"" is unoriginal, but at it's very best, the album is as beautiful & intelligent as it's singer. With vocal harmonies that would make the Mamas & the Papas take notice, Amerie delivers wonderful performances on tracks like, ""Why Don't We Fall In Love,"" and especially ""Got To Be There.""Best tracks (to me) are:1. Why Don't We Fall In Love? (one listen and I was hooked)2. Talkin' To Me (the catchiest song on the album)5. Need You Tonight (the harmonies are incredible on this track)6. Got To Be There (best track on the album)7. I Just Died (kinda sappy, but it's a true slow jam)9. Float (classy)Yeah, she may need to work on her live show and until she does then I'll keep listening to this."
5,Sweet Amerie,"This is an excellent debut featuring really good beats, easy to listen to summer grooves and a sprinkling of sweet ballads.My personal favorites: ""Nothing Like Loving You""--(I am wearing this cut out), ""I Just Died"" and the lead single ""Why Don't We Fall In Love""--a summer anthem and the video to match is perfect.Pick this one up...you won't regret the purchase."
5,Amerie saves R&B...............,"Actually when Aaliyah's soul departed last August, the R&B music industry, in my opinion, left with her. When Amerie came along with this album, it brought the refreshing sound that capitalizes on whats really important: Vocal capability. When I first heard this album, I was astonished at how great she sounded. Now you have to admit, Doesn't Amerie sound like SWV put all into one person?? She sings like a princess. My personal favorites are Can't Let Go ( She seems to pour her soul into this song) Talkin' 2 Me ( Great Winter song, and I like her Blanik boots in the video!) and Hatin On You, ( Alot of peoploe dont like this one, but I think the Lyrics and beat are on pointI look for to seeing Amerie around for a very long time, Unlike her other competititors, She has what J.Lo and so many other ""one-hit wonders"" have: SHE CAN ACTUALLY SING!!All I Have is basically a refreshing splash of what R&B should be, and picks up where SWV left off in 1992. Pick this one up!!"
5,incredible,"amerie's cd is a great listen and, as others have pointed out before, is very reminiscent of SWV in their heyday. not only are the tracks addictive, but amerie proves that she doesn't have to belt or superfluously trill to get her point across, what i see as a weakness of many otherwise very capable R&B singers. to me, this is one of the few worthwhile R&B cd's that has come out in a long time.while other artists, like ashanti, may be more commercially successful, amerie sports a better cd by far. they differ in the fact that ashanti has to hide her pleasant but ultimately weak and limited voice behind samples from well-known, popular songs, as well as riding on the coattails of a well-known rapper (ja rule). even if it ends up not getting the airplay it deserves, amerie's album is still one of those that you can listen to from beginning to end and not have to worry about skipping tracks."
5,why are you not witnessing this?,"why, why I say, are you not in ownership of such a great thing? All I have to say is that once in a great while we stumble upon something that will be considered greater later than it is now. Gorey has such a following that is almost cult-like. This is what mr. crab scrambly will become, I know this. We just need to see more books and sadenning tales such as this and the public will see. mr. scrambly, if you read this, know that you have a grand following already and the meek and followers of what is trend worthy will eventually wake to see such a book and your artwork. Excellent illustrations, all should see these, this book, if only for the illustrations, it is well worth a few dollars."
1,Mostly Pointless,"After reading JTHM and Squee, and after seeing some positive reviews here, I decided to give this a try. The artwork is nice, but the story lacks substance. It's too short to provide any substantial character development. Not worth buying. Borrow it from someone if you feel a need to read it."
3,ho hum,"I really don't understand what the other reviewers are so hyped up about. It's not that this is a bad book, it's just that I don't see it as being ""all that"". The art isn't special; the story doesn't have any real depth; and I don't see any universal truths being revealed. It's just a so-so book with a simple story and simple artwork. Not bad, just ho-hum."
3,It did help,"Wanted to extend the range of my wireless network. This product did work, but if you need a major boost, you might want to look at a repeater. Overall this is a good product, especially cost wise."
1,Hawking Hi-Gain is really a No-Gain,"I would have to agree with the majority of assessment of this product on Amazon: this product fails on every count.1. Most significantly, product does not perform as described. Signal strength not ""significantly improved."" In fact, no change in reception at all. I have used this in my one-story home and in a café I work at with no effect whatsoever.2. When there is a rebate, it is more trouble than it is work. [...]"
2,"Don't work well, buy it only when it's free after rebate","I connected it to my USB adapter's external antenna connector. But both sides are female connectors. So I have to do some mod. After that, no noticable imrpovement is found. Then I sticked a metal needle in USB adapter's external connector and that works better than this antenna.The product information should say clearly it's a female connector.And I don't know how they get the 6db out of this model, most likely a brag."
2,Didn't help,"I got this at BestBuy for five bucks (after rebate). Unfortunately, this didn't help at all. I use a d-link DI-614+ rev b, and this antenna actually reduced my signal by about 5% (according to MacStumber). while it might help some people, it didn't help me. Make sure you can return it if you get it."
4,Works Well,"Hi,I put this on a hawking pci card. Thought I would review as this configuration hasn't really been reviewed. Unlike the other poster in this thread, the connection mates are of the correct type (no rewiring necessary). 1st off, the pci card has 3 revisions under the same name, so reading the reviews can be challenging. I had revision r of the 54g pci card. This came surprisingly with a standalone antenna (not the stick coming out of the card shown with the picture. I got the 6db antenna for 5 bucks after rebate. It works quite well on my network card boosting reception over the otherwise external one supplied by up to 20% points (actually I am at 100% now). It also mounts nicely. I would however suggest if all costs equal going with a directional one. (this antenna picked up 3 sites I have never seen before even on my centrino laptop, but at 0% reception they were non-connectable)."
2,marginal improvement,I bought this product hoping to improve my signal strength but it provided a very marginal improvement over my original antenna that came with the D-LINK 802.11B router.Don't expect too much from this product.
4,20% improvement,"I'm noticing about a 20% improvement with this thing. For example, a reading upstairs that was once consistently 20-30% (usually around 25%) is now consistently 35-40%. As others have noted, it seems to help with bottoming out, creating a more consistent floor on the signal. So, it's not necessarily a miracle worker but it has provided a boost."
3,it works better on my SMC now,"I use it on the linky bridgethe signal strength and link quality are increased by 8-10 percent pointthen I found this antenna works better on single antenna device, on 2 antennae device, it may have problemupdate: this antenna works very well with SMC wireless router (used as ap) now, the result is good enough to get a stable connection with MS MN-710however, for further upgrade, I put an order to get 15dbi directional, in order to connect the forth-coming dell axim x30, since the kitchen is blind point, and the router is located at the edge of the house, a directional antenna can ""fire"" the signal throughout the housefor SMC 2804 users: connect the antenna at the connector near LAN jack (which is the REAL antenna jack), this helps"
5,Works for me...,"I bought one of these many years ago now (7-8 years) and it has always improved my connectivity and wireless performance in multiple locations. It is not a cure for difficult environments, and only doubles the signal strength, not the range, in real-world applications. Nonetheless the improvement has always been sufficient for my needs. (I have only ever used this with 802.11b/g standard networks, so I don't know if this will have any benefit on Type N setups, though the range on those was designed to obviate these little fixes.)"
1,Own D-Link DI-624? Don't Bother with This Antenna,"I have just now tested my signal strength at various locations with the D-Link DI-624 router's original antenna, and with this one. The HAI6SIP made no difference whatsoever at any location, regardless of its orientation. It's going back to the store tomorrow."
1,"Terrible Performance, Waste Of Time",This thing actually performed worse than the antenna that came with the wireless card. That means the range stated on the box is incorrect. Back to the store for a refund. You get what you pay for for.
1,Doesn't Work,I used this with my Linksys 802.11b wireless router and got no improvement in the range of the signal.
2,Mr Murder,"I enjoyed this despite myself. The film is overly long but I did stay the course. Mr Baldwin worked hard on the two parts, reasonably convincingly, though it nearly reached comic proportions in a couple of scenes when he was constantly switching between the good and bad guy to confuse the action and no doubt the audience too. In terms of a Dean Koontz book-to-film I felt it represented the writers intentions reasonably well. Worth a look, but don't expect it to be a concise adaption."
3,"Intelligent But Less Than Fascinating Picture of ""Utopia""","It's the 1950s and WW III is looming. A handful of people decide to create a back-to-nature-type commune, but they all have different ideas of what Utopia is, and whether it's even achievable.The author is obviously intelligent and perceptive. She focuses on nuances and admirably refrains from the cheap-shots that middle-class Utopians invite.Unfortunately, this short novel didn't really work for me -- I simply didn't care whether the commune succeeded or failed. And despite the detailed descriptions of the characters' thoughts and emotions, I seldom felt they approached flesh-and-blood reality. Rather, it seemed to me that the men and women here were mostly just part of a debate in the author's own mind."
3,the cylob sunset,"i really enjoyed hopscotch... if ur into U-ziq, Kosmik Kommando, and Aphex Twin then u can definitely dig this album. heh....."
5,Just like a new sander,The sanding discs would no longer stick to the pad on my sander. I wasn't sure if it was the discs or the pad. I took a chance and got a new pad. It was the pad! It now takes considerable effort to remove the disks! Works just like a new sander.
3,A Fair value,There is nothing wrong with the rplacement pad. It's just that it is vastly over priced. almost a third of what I paid for the whole sander kit.
5,Replacement sander pad...,"I've had this random orbit sander for about 10 years now, and after years of hard use on everything from sanding the reproduction Stickley furniture I make, to smoothing my amateur plastering patches in my 1920s house, the pad finally failed. This new pad is an exact replacement and restored my DW421 to top working condition!"
1,Sanding pad,After five minutes of using the new pad the screws that hold the pad to the sander pulled thru creating holes bigger than the screw heads making it unusable.The metal on the pad that the screws go in seem to be very thin and not as solid as the original pad.Very disappointing
3,not durable enough,the pads don't last long enough before the gripping surface wares out. the pad gives me at most a week of work
3,It covers the seat,"The headrest covers were a total waste in my Subaru as they didnt come close to fitting. The seat covers, however, were as expected and, well, cover the seat. Nothing stellar about them, but nothing horribly awry about them either."
1,Worst Cable Ever!,"This is the cable that comes with every new X-Box. Whoever designed this cable should be beaten with a large bag of Swedish Fish. I guess they failed to realize that some people would like to connect the Video (yellow) cable to their Television and the Audio (Red and White) to their stereo/surround receiver. Too bad the 3 plugs are fused together leaving about 2 inches to spare between each one. With all the time spent designing this console, you would think SOMEONE would realize it's not a good idea to force the plugs together.I would seriously give this cable a Zero star if it would let me. Now I am forced into buying the (...) advanced A/V pack just so I can hook up the console properly."
1,Regular XBOX cable,I returned item. It was not for xbox 360. It is for regular xbox. The advertisement is unclear that this cord isn't for the 360 so I was disappointed that it was not for the 360.
3,Great cord,"What can you say other than Go Xbox!The cord works perfectly and the cheeper the better. I feel like this cord was too expensive, especially for such an outdated console. You can buy the actual Xbox and cable for around $30. Not really worth buying for $10."
4,XBOX standard AV cable,I ordered this cable because the one I had stopped working. Now my original xbox works as good as new. The cable didn't come in a factory sealed package. That's the only reason for 4 stars out of 5.
5,Three's a charm.,Got my triple plug... YES!.. this is the older xbox cord and I need to write four more words thanks.
5,Or Perish in the Attempt,"Just finished this book and found it fascinating. Being from and living in the Pacific Northwest puts another perspective on the Lewis & Clark journey. It was particularly interesting that the author shed light on early 19th century medicine through the Lewis & Clark journey. Peck made both subjects very interesting, and I felt used a unique and humanistic style of writing in doing so. In reading the book, you feel like you can really identify with those that made the journey, almost as if you're traveling on the journey with them. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in U.S. History, Adventure and/or Medicine."
