2,Im sorry...,"This movie was ruined for me in the first five minutes and I will tell you why...THE NAZIS WERE NEVER IN SCOTLAND! Jesus, I would not have cared if every other aspect of the film was fictitious if they had only enough common sense to make the setting of the opening act somewhat plausible.For the rest of the movie I just kept thinking:"
3,NOTHING SPECIAL-A TRIFLE ENTERTAINING,"NOTHING SPECIAL-A TRIFLE ENTERTAINING really says it all.-watchable, yet there was something better you could have watched.Not upset you watched it-but you should have finished that book you were reading."
3,Fair comic translation.,"Wednesday, September 08, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Fair comic translation.Not a bad comic book translation, Hellboy starts off very well with a flashback to WWII and the Nazi's attempts to open a gateway to bring back ageless demon gods. Nice Lovecraft stuff sure, but additionally we get an interestingly compelling villain in the silent decaying assassin who dons various gas masks and wields knives in effective ninja style. The demon Hellboy squirts through the portal before the allies close it and is raised by an old looking John Hurt. Flash forward and the main antagonists are again at it in the 2000's, Hellboy in adolescence is joined by other paranormal fighters and must stop them. The makeup on Perlman is pretty good and the CG effects aren't too bad. It's not too engrossing but it was a pleasant time killer."
3,Good mindless fun....,"This is a fun mindless movie that emphasizes style over substance. It could have been a half hour shorter and no one would have cared. The movie itself moves a little slow but is generally good. However, it does not rise above the level of a typical comic book movie. The DVD is very nice with tons of extras and is jam packed full of great treats for fans of the movie. If you liked the movie then buy the DVD but beware because an extended edition of the movie will be making its way into stores in the fall."
5,A blast from start to finish,Just a blast! This movie if fun from start to finish. I saw it twice at the theater so far and will buy it as soon as it comes out on DVD. This movie really is awesome!
3,Eeeehhhh.......it's okay,"This is one of those movies where the previews make it seem really exciting, and then when you get into the theater, it's a letdown. I think the problem was the plot. It was missing something. Also, I felt a bit confused as to what was really happening towards the end. I think if del Toro had left all of those monsters out, and concentrated on the main enemies (Rasputin, Kroenen, and that weird blonde chick), this would have been a LOT better! Plus, the ending just seemed too clean and easy. I was expecting Hellboy to have to do some real fighting. LOL And what's up with the cats?!??! I would recommend seeing it...but don't hold your breath. Maybe the DVD will be better...but only if it has LOTS of extra features."
3,I have seen better,"I enjoyed VanHelsing and the Blade series, but for some reason this one was too much. May just be a generation gap."
3,"NOT GREAT, NOT HORRIBLE, JUST OKAY.","This movie was exactly what I was expecting. It had entertaining CGI action sequences, and cheesy not-very-well acted drama. The plot doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat, but overall the movie was worth seeing."
2,Major Disappointment,"What a major disappointment. Maybe I expected too much from Guillermo del Toro, but is this the same guy that made the great Cronos and The Devil's Backbone, not to mention the at least entertaining Blade II. Why do directors always screw up their dream projects? This movie had one great character (the sardonic Hellboy) and one cool villain sidekick (knife wielding Kroenen) trapped in a clich√©d story that never went anywhere. I think del Toro just got too ambitious and bite off more than he could chew, trying in vain to juggle too many things at once. Sometimes that is admirable, but not when the whole things turned into such a complete mess. There is a director's version DVD coming out later this year of course, but since it's longer and not shorter, I doubt it will stop the film from simply clonking along."
3,Keeping my fingers crossed for a better PART TWO!,"Having read several of the comics on which this film is based, I had high hopes for the film. Sadly, it didn't measure up to my expectations. It was too derivative and depended too much on special effects-laden fight sequences.Ron Perlman plays Hellboy as if he were Benjamin Grimm/The Thing from ""The Fantastic Four"": a mixture of bravado and pathos. It's not surprising that the actor was able to exude some humanity under all that red makeup; he has made a career out of playing costumed characters (""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"", ""Star Trek: Nemesis"").In addition to Hellboy the only other notable character was ""Abe Sapien"", physically performed by Doug Jones and voiced"" by ""Frasier's"" David Hyde Pierce. The character's screen time is limited but memorable.Hopefully, in the sequel (and I'm sure that there will be one) there will be greater development of the Hellboy character, the most interesting comic hero in some time."
4,Great Movies,"Bought my husband the die hard collection, and Hell boy the movie great movies, I even liked them, and better yet if you have a nice surround system. Buying throug Amazon was fast and great service will for sure use the service again."
3,Not bad.,"Had some good lines. Decent special effects. Average story. Ron Pearlman did great as HB. See this one on the big screen, but matinee, and you won't be dissapointed."
5,hellboy,"I think Hellboy is a pretty cool movie. The acting fits right in with action with just right story. It's nice that the fact that they brung back an old comic and actully bring some of it in the movie. The sound is perfect the story is a big gooeye ball of ideas, twist's, and even mythogicol creatures and wow,they even have stuff about Jesus. Once this bigboy I mean Hellboy comes to dvd and video I will buy it and mabye a few for my cousins. Well that's what I think About Hellboy."
3,"Patience, people","If you just have to have it now, go ahead. But a better version is coming for Halloween. It's a three-disc director's cut with 15 minutes of extra footage sliced from the theatrical release, as well as improved bonus materials. Studios continue to milk consumers out of their money by releasing and re-releasing the SAME MOVIES. Don't fall for it."
5,Wasnt bad wasnt great.,I loved this movie id go see it again. Ill be the first one to get it when it comes out on dvd it had some akward parts and the story line had holes in it but as they said this movie is not based on the first comic book. As far as the art work for the comic book which i recently went and read a bunch of the art work sucks. The hellboy in the movie looks a lot better.
2,Another second rate comic book movie.,"Yes, the art direction was first class. It moved along well, the acting and tone was perfect for a comic book movie. BUT, what the heck was the plot all about? Who needed Hellboy? Everybody could have knocked off early and gone out for a beer if they just let the character with pyrokenesis fry the baddies in the first place. And, the ultimate demon from the darkside gets taken out with grenades? Talk about the ultimate anti-climax. Who knew that the forces of evil were such a light load? Another second rate comic book movie."
3,Glad I borrowed it!,"Ever watch a video at home and say ""geeze I'm glad I didn't buy that one!?"" Well this is one of them. I thought for a moment I was watching ""Raider of the lost Ark""..then it all went south...I mean what the heck? I like logical progression...this isnt that..a Baby Ruth lovin' little red devil...(how'd that get there?) next thing..a full grown trouble makin', head grindin' cigar smokin' monster fighter..with a bad attitude. Well one good thing..I still have my money...."
2,Perlman's Chin wins the award for best supporting actor.,The only reason to watch this movie is to marvel at the enormous magnitude of Ron's Chin. His only rival is the guy from Tango and Cash who has the Super Chin. This movie would have done alot better if they cast the Super Chin as Ron's sidekick or if they would have just renamed the movie to Hellchin.
1,Worst Film of 2004 so far,"I thought Dare Devil was bad, but Hellboy seems to have done the impossible and is even worse. So why is it so bad? The story line is just lame!!!! It is not even simple to follow, it just seems to be a load of pointless action scenes. Although I think the character Helboy is cool, that stupid fish boy is just boring and the fire girl is so wooden. I think there could be a good film in the franchise, but this is just poor. Avoid at all costs!!!!"
5,Hellboy is a Helluva Movie,"Hellboy is one of the best action movies ever made. Hellboy contains lots of laughs and edge-of-your seat action. The effects are flawless. Ron Perlman carries the movie with his unusual and wonderful character.Hellboy is a cat-loving son of Satan who is tough as hell but also tender hearted. The romance story in the movie was such that even guys will like it. (honest!)Good versus evil is always a powerful theme when executed well. The story that even a demon can choose redemption lends an almost-new level to the genre, except that Spawn and Blade have already explored that idea.Hellboy is a super hero for the ages. I do believe this will be an enduring classic."
4,A surprice Perlman makes the film,It's hard to make a film believable. But in this film it's hard not to suspend your disbaliefs Perlman makes you believe that something or someone like Hellboy could exist.Selma Blair plays an excelent example of why we don't want to be born with any powers!If your into high flying action and a cigar smoking hero with a really big gun. This movie is for you
4,Well worth the time & money,"I'll admit up front, I never read Hellboy comics. Still, when I saw it today, I was immersed in the story & characters. Beyond all the fighting (too much CGI, as always, Del Toro!), and the ""All I want is to fit in"" schlock that actually works, there is some character development that has lacked in other comic crossovers (X-Men, Spider-Man, etc...)Major positive points: WOW! Ron Perlman was fantastic! Perfect blend of ""tough-guy"" along with the uncertainty of an over-protected adolescent. The backstory was EXTENSIVE, but worth it. Great solid supporting cast. Del Toro's fascination with horror and the almighty BOO! pay off a few times, though of course there is lots of goop (a la Blade 2).Overall, I have to sum this up by saying:I am going back to see it again within the next 3 days!"
2,Nice way to waste your money,"Okay, I hope that if you plan on buying this copy of the film, you haven't already bought the special edition. I know I'm glad I didn't buy it yet, because I would be glad to get this copy. But still why do the studios feel compelled to release the director's cut when the special edition has been out for 3 months? Because they're all about the money. I loved Hellboy, and I'm sure many of you did too, but if you already bought the special edition save your money for something else."
3,Some funny scenes + So so special effects = Worth seeing.,This movie has some funny scenes. The special effects are so so. One thing I don't like is the disguise of the main character. It's obvious his is wearing a mask and what looks like a plastic suit.It's worth watching.
2,HELL NO! (2 1/2 STARS),"This movie had good special FX,but got boring pretty fast! Notthe worst movie I've ever seen,but not the best either. Atleastthe disc has good sound quality."
2,Hellboy is a Soulless Special Effects Orgy,"This movie's target audience is 14-year-old boys. There's no question about that. It's packed with special effects, weird characters and plenty of over-the-top action. It's also packed with corny dialog, mediocre acting, and just about every action movie cliche you could think of. It could easily be called the Masters of the Universe of the 21st century. Lots of window dressing and not much else. Oh, and what's with the fey fish-man? Very disturbing. Rent before you buy."
4,Hellish!,"Oh No! Those evil nazis are back, attempting to gate in another slimy entity from the great beyond! It's up to HELLBOY (Ron Perlman) and his band of misfits (including Abe Sapien the fishman) to stop them. HELLBOY is a good solid wiz-bang of a movie! Lots of excitement, gunfire, explosions, and a fairly decent plot. There's even a love interest that actually works without making us wanna barf! I loved the Firestarter gal! As for the bad guys, I thought the self-mutilated nazi fella was totally creepy / cool! HELLBOY has potential as a series of movies, IF the stories are good. Perlman is a natural as the demonoid hero! Check it out..."
5,A Musk-Buy Purchase,"I love this stuff, and this was the best price to be found anywhere, less than half of the store price. EXCELLENT VALUE!"
2,"Dusty old stock, bad packaging","Product itself was made well, but it had apparently been stored for a long time and had been crushed in the packaging, so it was slightly out of whack and very dusty - and the box it was in was disintegrating.It was also odd that this company closed for an entire week in March for some kind of company holiday during which time they didn't process any orders. Seems like people could rotate vacations, yes? I found out after I paid big $ for expedited shipping and then found out I may have to wait a out their vacation for it to be sent. !!!Still - kudos to the staff for FINALLY agreeing to ship them before they left (I ordered 11). I only wish it hadn't taken several angry phone calls to make it happen.Overall - an amateur firm. Probably shouldn't do business with progressive company like Amazon. Maybe a mom and pop somewhere in like Kansas? I dunno. It was odd."
5,Thrilled With First LCD,"This was my first LCD purchase, and simply put: I'm thrilled!! This was an excellent replacement to my old 17"" CRT. 5 Stars mainly due to value. It's no Sony X-Brite monitor, but for $315 with a 16ms reponse time and DVI, I can't complain. Zero ghosting, fabulous colors - I was hesitant about the BenQ name, but I'm glad I made the plunge."
5,Awesome 1960's Pop Album!,"This is a great 1960's album. Comparisons to the Zombie's ""Odyssey and Oracle"" (also recommended) are valid, as both the feel and strength of the songs are similar. This album puts you in a good mood. Definitely a concept album, though the precise concept is not so much subject as musical style. Stand-out melodies are carried along by breezily reverbed vocals, tasteful strings, and baroque harpsichord, in addition to the standard pop line-up. A very clean-- almost classical production-style. Sundazed has done an excellent job with the re-mastering on this CD. The stereo separation typical of the 1960s is interesting to listen to, and the sound quality exceeds most recordings produced today. Buy it-- You won't be dissapointed. Also recommended: Love's ""Forever Changes,"" and the ""Presidents of the United States of America"" album."
3,My World Fell Down is a great song- rest of the album FLUFF,"I got this album a while back thinking that it was truely going to be some great link to the lost Smile album of the Beach boys- ""My World Fell Down"" is truely a great song with all the great ingredients to the Beach Boys Pet Sounds/ Smile era sound- mostly because of Bruce Johnston, Glenn Campbell, and Gary Usher (all member's of the Beach Boys in one way or another- usher co-wrote many great songs with B. Wilson). But that is the only song that Johnston and Campbell sing on and its the only song written by Usher... The rest of the album is floating on the clouds with no true heart- just fluff with no soul. Unfortunatley, MY WORLD FELL DOWN is just that good of a song that the album for some could be worth getting (both the bull fight extended version and the single version)."
4,Pleasant Marshmellow Pop,"Curt Boettcher is one of those guys whose name is always popping up in relation to cool, obscure 60s psych pop bands. He worked a lot with producer/arranger Gary Usher, was a member of The Millennium, whose album, Begin, is one of the great unacknowledged 60s records. And Boettcher was part of Sagittarius, a band that also featured a young Glen Campbell. Sag made just this one album, and it is just about perfect. Some kind of cross between Donovan, psychedelic Beach Boys, and bubblegum, the songs are pleasantly light and just psychedelic enough. Lilting melodies will take your mind to another place. ""My World Fell Down,"" the best song of album, has already achieved cult status by being handpicked for the Nuggets collection. And there are three or four other tracks here which are just about as good as that one."
2,disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this book. It's about Jake Turner who is a cartargrapher/scout/spy trying to map out a route across the great divide and desert and rockies to calif for Pres Jackson. On his way he saves a woman from an indian attack and is forced to take her with him on his mission. However she has lots of issues!! Jake, once nearly trapped into marriage, distrusts women (and incessently talks about it) while emma, theproduct of an abusive father, is afraid she's losing her mind (and incessently goes on about that.) I am halfway thru this book and find absolutely no reason to continue. There is nothing likeable about Jake Turner and the only thing I liked about Emma was her horse, scout, who tried to bite Jake in the butt every chance he got. Good horsey!!LOL.........Sorry, JK, this one didn't get the job done........"
2,Send it back to the publisher for corrections,"Failed to meet reader expectations for accuracy!On p. 268 the author states: ""Christians had succeeded so well in making Jerusalem the heart of their religion that in the 1922 British census, they constituted 51 percent of the population.""Later on the same page he indicates that the percentage was 18 percent. The 18% figure is contradicted by the Jerusalem census figures that he gives on p. 60 where the real percentage (after calculating it from the population figures) is 9%.Also on p. 268 the author quotes Riah Abu El Assal that since the Israeli annexation in 1967 that ""the number of Christians dropped from 28,000 to 7,000."" On p. 60 his census figures show that in 1967 the Christian population of Jerusalem was 12,646 and that in 1999+ it had grown to 20,000.Either the technical editor was incompetent, or this was a clumsy insertion of Palestintian propaganda for the purpose of scoring a few propaganda points."
1,Such a great show but such poor DVD Video Quality,This is one of my top 5 favorite TV shows of all time. I looked forward to receiving the first season DVD set so I could enjoy once again this great comedy. The show itself is 5 stars all the way but this is the worst quality DVD video I have ever seen. Because of this I can not recommend you buy it. Very disappointing that such a great comedy got this type of treatment from the producer of the DVD. It looks like someone took a VHS copy in SLP mode and copied it to DVD. I sent my first copy back to Amazon because I thought it was defective. When I got my 2nd copy the video was just as bad as the first one so I guess that is the way they all are.
5,The best ever,"Simply put, Barney Miller is the best comedy ever. Period. Intelligently written with warmth, humor, emotion, etc and dealing with the issues of the day. Compared to the garbage shown on TV today that TV execs call sitcoms, this show evokes the same feelings it did 30 years ago. I doubt that same statement will be said about Friends. What other sitcom has an entire cast of characters as brillantly developed as this one? Can you pick out your favorite character? It's difficult when they all were so fabulously portrayed by each member of the cast.Unfortuantely, like the other reviews have stated, the picture quality for some of the episodes is questionable but worth the annoyance. Come on Sony, bring on season 2."
3,The Early Years,"I love this show. But as I found out, the first year was not the best. Missing are two of my favorite characters, little Levitz and Diedrich. These two really made the show great."
3,one of the best comedies,"Barney Miller really hit it's stride after the first season. I think the best addition was Steve Landesburg. It was one of the few comedies that make the viewer laugh out loud, whereas most sitcoms are mildly amusing at best."
3,"Great show, bad quality DVD","I bought this as a gift for my father. I can remember watching Barney Miller all the time growing up. The show is as humorous today as it was back then. It's a great cast that just seems to be having fun the whole time.The quality of the DVDs however is not quite up to par. The sound is ok, but the picture is terrible. It's as if they turned my HDTV into a 1970s console TV.It's still worth buying, just don't expect the DVD quality picture you are used to."
4,Fantastic Show but POOR Reproduction,"I love this show and look forward to purchasing all seasons. However, note that the DVD's video reproduction is LESS THAN STELLAR! The picture quality seems faded and out of focus and not at all what one expects from the DVD experience. Even so, this is a must own season 1 set. Just don't expect to be blown away by the picture quality."
5,Cop Says: BEST COP SHOW...EVER!,"As a kid growing up in Brooklyn in the 70's I never missed an episode of BM.When I eventually grew up and joined the NYPD in 1987, I realized that a lot of squad rooms around the city had (characters)cops, sergeants, Lt's and Captains just like those seen on TV.This was the most life-like comparison to the real squads in the NYPD - in some cases BM was more normal."
5,Even Better than I Remember!,"This is a Great Sitcom!The acting and the interaction of the original main characters is what sets this Sitcom apart from the rest. The men of the one-two encounter serious situations that they are able to handle with their own inimitable style. They dispense justice with common sense, judgement, warmth and more than a little bit of humor.The writers created truly unique unforgettable characters.Barney Miller - The big hearted practical problem solver. Barney would make a Great Police Commissioner or Big City Mayor.Fish - A mischevious, wisened old detective awaiting retirement.Yamana - The perpetual Gambler with a dry sense of humor.Wojo - The over eager young detective that loves women and doesn't think too hard.Harris - The dreamer that would rather be a novelist than a cop but needs a job to pay the bills until the big break comes along.I think that they are all individually Great Actors but as a Squad they are incredible. Join the Fun!"
5,Barney Miller fan since High School,"I became a fan of this show when it first aired in the 70's (I was 14) and continued until the show ended in the early 80's. I truly think it is one of the best sitcoms of all times, even with the rough start in Season 1. Some of the episodes I haven't seen in over 25 years, yet I can still remember them today (Brownie and Werewolf episodes crack me up just thinking about them).It is a shame that TV(waste)Land stopped airing this show. It's more of a shame that we can't get all of the seasons on DVD. I watched Season 2 straight through and am so mad that there are no more episodes released. Season 2 is 10 times better than Season 1 and I consider Season 1 to be very good.Just who do we have to write in order to get additional episodes? Well worth making a fuss about. Given all of the police shows produced over the years I find it amazing that Barney Miller and The Closer (Kyra Sedgewick) are the only 2 that I've purchased."
3,"The Show is Great, But Give Us Extras!","Barney Miller is one of the best situation comedies every created. The first season started slowly, as the characters were trying to find themselves. However, after a few episodes the show began to click. The last episode of the season, ""The Hero,"" in which Chano is forced to shoot some bank robbers (off screen), is very moving as well as funny. The only problem with the DVD is the absence of extras. I would like to have had a commentary or two by Danny Arnold and Hal Linden.Barney Miller - The First Season"
4,The old shows are the best shows,"This show, even though the clothes are outdated, is still very funny! It's nice to be able to just relax and laugh without all the innuendos that are in today's shows.It brought back good memories - and Hal Linden is the best!"
5,The best police show ever!,"I remember watching this show with my dad as a kid. Even though the first couple of seasons I dont remember, I rediscovered the show through TV Land and was thrilled when season 1 was brought out on DVD. I'm with everyone else, let's have the rest of the seasons! I had joined the Columbia House Library for this show on Video but I HATE when they put episodes out in not chronological order. They produced a handful of tapes and then stopped. Argh.I really hope the rest of this show is brought out! The one episode I havent seen in years is the one with the man that thinks he's a werewolf. Brilliant.May I just say that the world of entertainment lost a truly gifted actor when Jack Soo died."
5,the thinking person's cop show,"One of the top five cop/crime shows ever. Great cast. OK representation of New York City at the time.Hopefully after this they'll release ""Joe Bash""!Hey, I'm not kidding about ""Joe Bash""! That was a great show.The last several years, crime shows are all about the action and chases and gunshots. Barney Miller, Joe Bash and most of Hill Street Blues were great because there was mostly just talking going on."
5,Love this show!,"Okay, you are BEING warned.You already KNOW if you LOVE this show.If you are gonna BUY it, you can only buy the first three seasons...or buy the Complete set.I recommend the latter!"
2,Disappointed,"As much as I was looking forward to this, as I now unwrap it and try it out, I'm extremely disappointed because of the very poor picture quality. What's the deal? I have Hogan's Heroes, a much older ""color"" TV series and the picture quality is great.The first episode is only 20 minutes long. I'm more used to about 25 minutes. Not sure what that's about.And hey for the older people, why no subtitles? In year 2011, it's nothing but cheap that they didn't add English subtitles (for older people with hearing problems) and at least Spanish. Again, what the heck?"
4,If you like Richard Sharpe you will love Lt. Val Aston,"The story is really from the pov of the hero Valentine Aston, who is the natural son of an Earl. The prolouge is quite long but it helps to understand this dishy hero. The time setting is early in the Peninsular war as Wellington and his troops are trying to push the French from Portugal. The heroine is wonderful as well as she helps him to come to grips with who he is and how to love. There is quite a good story here and though I did firgure out what was going on early I loved how the author spun the tale as our wonderful hero Val grew to understand love and what it meant to be loved. Ms Farrell's ability to show the transformation was quite good. There were great secondary characters but they never took over. She even added a bit of humor with the hero and a piglet. If you like the regency period but want a story that has messages for today this is one that you should check out. This one moved me to tears more than once."
1,Not exactly a page turner,"I did not enjoy this book at all. Val, our main romance interest, had such a chip on his shoulder because of his birth and was so dour (the man never smiled) that he was not an enjoyable male lead. His personalty was poor, and while he had a terrific body, he was not even good looking with a huge nose. Yuk. And the female main character, Elspeth, homely, too, was not interesting, either. I liked Val's brother, Charlie, and James. But I would not bother with this one. Very boring."
3,military Regency Romance...,"a bit slow going but still entertaining. Much more of a novel about the hero, Valentine, than a Romance. Regency, but the characters are involved in the war and most of the story is set on the frontlines. The heroine is the daughter of a Major who ""follows the drum"" along with her mother. Medium romance and love scenes pretty tame. 3 stars."
3,Go Sigourney Go !,"The story line is okay but not great, though it will hold your interest. Some nifty nude scenes of Sigourney that make the film kind of special."
5,The Best Wicker Repair Book on the Market-Ever!,"Thomas Duncan outdid himself when he wrote this difinitive book on wicker furniture repair several years ago! It is the only book on the market that covers in great detail, how to repair all types of wicker furniture.With clear photographs and concise text, each and every step is covered that the wicker repair specialist might encounter. There are also many, many instances of woodworking problems with solutions that I found expecially helpful.From simple pairing, twining and arrow weave to the more difficult serpentine arm and back weaving, Tom covers it all, even down to making the most difficult reed ""curliques""! He also goes to great lengths dealing with stripping and paint and varnish finishing techniques.Run right out and purchase this terrific book to add to your reference library, you'll be glad you did."
3,Northern Spain (Cardogan Guides),"After much search for a book on Northern Spain. I believe this Cardogan guide to be one of the better ones. It does provide some essentials: overview and history of Spain's northern regions, culture, cuisine and travel highlights. Also good recommendations on where to stay and have a friendly drink with the locals.A few drawbacks: lack of comprehensive maps of regions in relation to Spain as a country and more specific maps of towns that you may want to visit.All in all this is the best guide I've found available to get you started and excited about your trip as well as help you focus your travels to a particular area in Northern Spain if time is a concern."
2,"Despite errors, still the most thorough","Facaros and Pauls are erudite people, who unfortunately do not always understand the delicate balance between good depth of knowledge, and useless obscure references. Furthermore, they made a few mistakes, and a subtle anti-Catholocism was evident in their writing (i.e. by not mentioing that Covadonga is a pilgrammage destination where a virgin's apparition occurred, and that the Oviedo's cathedral hosts the suderio santo, the rag Jesus wore while on his way to the Crucifixion). We sometimes doubted that the authors had actually visited the places described within, or if so, they they did not understand the guides! While not the best for logistics, this guide does offer the best quantity of history per page."
1,Sigma,"Buying this camera was a total mistake. I had it for 3 months and it started using batteries, $36.00 worth in two days. I returned it to Sigma on December 10th and kept calling them. They told me they were too busy to look at my camera and call back at the end of January. I called again and was told the manager would call me, he never called. I then sent an email and they never responded. I went out of town for the weekend and came home and my camera had been left on the porch for 4 days in the cold and rain. I have never seen such poor customer service. Not quite sure about the camera yet because I wasn't able to use it very long."
1,Worst mistake I made in buying,"This was a total mistake. I should have stuck with a major known camera manufacture. It hasn't worked right since day one. I finally gave up getting help from Sigma on repairs, and had to take to local photo store. They laughed, and said it would be cheaper to buy a new one then repair the Sigma which is new, and only used once. If there was anyway I could return and get my money back I would, right now its headed for the garbarge."
1,WRONG ITEM,Company shipped wrong item. Item package arrived destroyed. Company would not accept return. VERY UPSET AND DISSAPPOINTED with company. Would select ZERO Stars.
3,smells good...,"i think it works... but it's awfully liquidy. i suppose i've gotten pretty used to some intense scrubbing action from other products. but this stuff smells nice and seems to soften everything up, even if it doesn't scrape it off."
1,Not much power,"It would not start my 28' boat battery on a full charge. Would not start my Gator on a 75% charge. So what's the point of having it?What prompted me to write this is the fact that there is no call out on the unit as to the correct wall charger to use, ie, Volts and Amps required to charge the unit back up. We all have the annoying problem of matching up the wall charger. There is no way to do this with the Vector system. I cannot find any tech support info anywhere on the web, and naturally, they do not bother to label their wall plug (like most companies)."
4,Great Drawings,"Like I said, the drawings are great, but the story, despite creative, is not that great, especially the end, wich is predictable, very predictable. If you expect Spawn to show up, it's best if you buy Blood And Salvation, in this one the main characters are two lesbian women."
3,Disappointed,"I was pleased to see a book that didn't feature a cowboy or a millionaire executive. I'm not a NASCAR fan personally, but several of my family members are.My disappointment was in Rick Castles. He was just too childish and petulant about having a woman in the pit. Even after he knew how good she was at her PR job, he was still trying to undermine her. Good grief! Just because he had one girlfriend who was scared to death of the races. Gimme a break!Liz Mallory was a delight and far too good for this schmuck. I was glad to see that she could be atracted to Rick and still function well in her job. Although I'm not sure how she could make him look good to the public and keep her self-respect. <G> And that she was willing to learn about the racing circuit in order to make her job go more smoothly was a definite plus.I gave the book 3 stars because of the NASCAR theme and because of the strong heroine. Took away 2 because the hero is such an idiot. Not on my keeper shelf."
1,Don't bother,"(...)The appendixes are not and make up half the book. Boringly basic. If you know absolutely nothing about government contracting, it is worth the read."
4,mandatory read for anyone in goernment contracting,"This book is more like a manual on government contracting with content covering all cycles including procurement. While it covers all aspects of contracting, it doesn't replicate the years of experience a contracting professionals have. For example, the BPA (Blanket Purchase Agreement) section covers the mechanics (what) of the BPA, but lacks detailed explanation on why, how, who, or where the BPA is more beneficial than other means of contracting.This books should be on everyone's bookcase, but should not be the only source of information.Strongly recommended for someone new in the field, but optional for professionals."
5,Iconic American History,"Albert Brooks has the insight to lay bare our American foibles without being mean or sarcastic. This movie is ""old"" yet continues to speak to us. It's one of those movies whose lines keep coming back to you and become part of your outlook. A movie that is worth buying to keep as part of your collection."
5,fun even if you're not a comedy-lover,this movie is hilarious. i am not an easy laugher and most movies that are supposed to be funny just make me roll my eyes. the situation is very easy to relate to--who hasn't dreamed of chucking the corporate life and living more simply? men and women will enjoy it equally. i even sent a dvd to my financial advisor.
2,so so,based on earlier reviews I watched the movie but for some reason it bored me. Maybe its the kind of film that needs an audience.
3,Okay,Typical Albert Brooks movie; way too much talking (ranting and raving by Albert is more like it) and a pretty weak story line.
4,Entertaining,"This is a clever vehicle to showcase the manic outbursts of Albert Brooks. There are themes of middle age boredom, being unappreciated at work, and the general dilemma of how old does one have to be to stop worrying about career and really enjoy life. It pokes a sharp stick in the eye of the materialism of the 1980's and provides a few laughs along the way."
5,Albert Brooks is an American treasure,"His writing is impeccable, his delivery -spot on. I'd recommend this to anyone who can appreciate a movie that has a story in it!"
2,"quite funny, but depressing really","I came to this movie thinking that it was going to be hilarious - I'd seen it on the AFI 100 all-time funniest movies. Sadly, I was disappointed.It seems disjointed and depressing, on a topic which could have been both funny and uplifting: ie quitting your job and embarking on new horizons.Not my cup of tea, and not your cup of tea, if you look for movies to take you to a new and exciting place."
5,Failed Experiement of Alternative Living Succeeds as Movie,"A yuppie couple quits thier jobs and searches for spiritual truth inside a garish Winnebago, losing their ""nest egg"" in the process and learning that they have to compromise and swallow their egos in order to strike a balance between having their materialistic goodies and achieving marital intimacy.The great joke of this film is that Albert Brooks, playing David Howard, thinks he pursuing some ideal by quitting his job; in fact, his ego has suffered a massive injury when a mediocre parvenu gets David Howard's senior vice president position at an ad agency. As a result of this grave ""injustice,"" Howard flips his lid, gets fired, and veils his rage as a clarifying moment of truth when he must embark on a quest for authenticity of the self. The joke builds on itself effectively for the entire movie and ends with a surprisingly conservative message about finding contentment in America."
2,lost in america,You have to be a huge Albert Brooks fan to really enjoy this movie. Not much of a plot and only mildly funny. Basically---the younger you are the less funny the movie!!
1,didn't play properly,"i got this for my daughter for christmas, she loves Albert Brooks movies and had never seen this one. halfway through the movie froze.We were pretty disappointed."
1,Great movie! But Cheap DVD unwatchable had to return it,First of all I would like to say that this is a great movie! But we tried watching it and it blurs and freezes more than a dozen times which made this unwatchable for us. It appears to be a cheaply made DVD I returned it today and did not request another. Advice to Amazon.com to check with the vendor who is making this DVD.
5,The man who put a voice to a song!,"Its great to have this collection available again. I will tell you that I played this cassette to death and I will do the same to the CD. All the songs are good. Conway doesnt get all the recognition that many of the other greats got but if you wanted to step outside of the typical Conway collection, this is it. There are hits on this CD that represent the 80's crossover surge that he shared with artist like The Oakridge Boys and Kenny Rogers."
4,Sixteen and dying,Dying at a young ageThe book I read was Sixteen and Dying. It was a really good. The book is a bout a girl she is Sixteen. She went to the doctor and found out she had aids. The she had to spend her spring break in the hospital. For the summer she went to a camp with her dad she loves to ride horses and this camp had horses. Her first day there she met some one. Her name was Marti. Marti spends her summers out there working there. Then Anne meets this guys named Morgan . Morgan has a crush on Anne. Annes dad told Morgan that they could not like each other. Anne was really up set. One day Anne cut her hand and Morgan was there. He tried to help her. She said no I don't need your help. Because of her HIVs. Things I like about the book was that it was kinda romantic. Morgan was nice to Anne and was a good friend to her.This was a really good book to read. That's if you like romantic book.
1,Please,"I bought this book a long time ago, when I was about 14. I started it several times and never managed to make myself finish it. Fast forward over a decade later and, in a fit of desperation, I picked this up again. I am generally loathe to remark negatively on something someone probably worked hard on, but I can't say that I believe fully that Morrison worked very hard on this. It's severely lacking in anything that most people don't already know and there is a curious focus on Christian symbolism for what is supposed to be a witch's book of symbols. Though I suppose(doubtfully) that perhaps Christian witches might find it interesting. Also, the symbols that are mentioned seem to be randomly chosen, mentioning things that could have been left out and completely missing symbols that would be more useful to the witch's mentioned in the title."
4,Why only 7 steps?,I am thoroughly enjoying reading this book. I find that much of it works well with the twelve-step program I am already in. I do look up all the scriptures in my own Bible and find that some are quoting only partial verses or taken out of context. This book is more than a quick read; the steps will need to be worked through a little at a time in order to be effective.
5,"Lord, I want to be Whole","If you want NEW life, If you want to be RESTORED and delivered from the enemy's bondage, please read this book. It spells out Deliverence in a very easy simple steps. It totally changed my life. it is bades on the scriptures, and it is easy to do and very effective. I would recommend that one take time to go over each step thouroughly to get the maximum benefit out of it. IT IS AWESOME book."
5,works great,perfect for taking a movie on an overnight trip and keeping the kids entertained. Quality is good considering the source. i recommend it to anyone.
2,Must work as listed,Product does not work as listed! Do not waste your time or money on this product! You better off shopping for a different product!
1,:(,Well the product seems to work but doesn`t sound very well or put the video on my tv. Perhaps I have to buy another adapter or something to plug this into. Lame. So now I have to go buy something else. Easy to use but didn`t find it worked good.
2,The Case of Missing Information,"The way this is supposed to work: Hook up the cable to your zune and then to the TV, corresponding the colours.They way thay say you need to do it: Do the same thing but with the zune dock.I am deffinately not happy about this. I just spent about $10 on something that is worthless to me, because I can only get the sound, and not the picture. Waste of money."
4,For the fans,"Great stuff here...if your a fan, Its short, but Frank jnr,Nancy and Tina's contemplation make it that bit more special, the special features are a HOOT! I am saving 'Happy Holidays' for Christmas 2007"
3,Good but too expensive,This is perhaps most electronic tooth brushes' problems: The companies sell these replacement heads for a very expensive price!! The original price for one head is $4!!! Crazy!
4,"Wow, I'm surprised nobody here really 'got' it","Many people have wondered here at the strange selection of the songs on this album. I've listened to it for years and always thought the theme was obvious: Simon has put together a little biography of his life, from songs written at the time. From his childhood through his years w/Garfunkle, joys of fatherhood and the arc of his relationship/marriage/divorce with Carrie Fischer, it's all here in a tidy little package. The chronicle mostly concentrates on his Fischer years; I'm not sure why he finishes up with Diamonds & Al, other than the fact that they were hits around the time the album was released and served to give it a little momentum in the stores.Back in those days, Simon was incapable of writing a bad song. You can't go wrong buying this one, but don't treat it as a greatest hits CD -- accept it as a little story of Simon's life, which is what his songs have always been about anyway."
4,Need an Easy-To-Read Track List?,1. Mother and Child Reunion2. Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard3. Something So Right4. St. Judy's Comet5. Loves Me Like a Rock6. Kodachrome7. Have a Good Time8. 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover9. Still Crazy After All These Years10. Late in the Evening11. Slip Slidin' Away12. Hearts and Bones13. Train in the Distance14. Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog After the War15. Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes16. You Can Call Me Al
3,Don't taaaake my Kodachrome away......,"Oh yeah. I guess I'm not a huge Paul Simon fan. Funny, thought I leaned in that direction. A couple of good songs on this... okay GREAT. Kodachrome and Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard. Those two are worth the disk's price.But the other songs are a little somber and plodding. Give me ""How I was john MacNamarra'd Into Submission"" any day"
5,A SUPER CLASSIC GREATEST HITS CD,"This CD rocks and thats all their is to it. Paul Simone s talent is in producing number one hits is evident here. He takes you from his early days up through the Ealry 1970's and holds you there frozen in musical time. For myself? This is one of his Best Works. Containg the hit Kodachrome, 50 ways to leave your lover. Late in the evening...and many many more.Well worth any ones collection."
5,EXCELLENT,"An all around excellent CD. If you like Paul Simon, you must get this CD. This has an excellent selection and variety of songs, almost all of which are really good. BUY THIS CD!!!"
3,"Simon's ""Negotiations""","got boring after awhile; not Simon's fault, I just prefer the duo with Garfunkel............"
3,Average,"This movie is the first of what is currently a four-part series about the rapture and ensuing tribulation that includes Apocalypse, Revelation, Tribulation, and Judgement. Each movie has gotten progressively better. Apocalypse is decent but has some problems with the scriptwriters simply not thinking. For example, even though the rapture is supposed to be a surprise, the main character's grandmother has time to write a going away note. Also, the antichrist is indwelled by the devil before the rapture occurs, despite the fact that Jesus said only God knows when the rapture will be.I strongly suggest adding the whole series to your library - all four movies are very useful for witnessing to others."
5,Excellent Christian Film,This film is the first in a series popularly known as the apocalypse series.It chronicles the Rapture and and the rise of the Antichrist.It shows how the Antichrist will be a great deciever and that he will decieve billions of people. It ends with the Martyrdom of new Christians.This film shows us what will happen in the near future as it has been predicted in the Bible.It is a low-budget film but is important to note the film's message and plot rather than its special effects and acting.
4,FINALLY ON DVD!,"""Apocalypse"" is the one that started the revolution in Christian filmmaking. Sure, you may think ""The Omega Code"" started it, but this film stands up a whole lot better! The DVD is alright, having just trailers and a music video made up of scenes from the movie. A great buy!Movie Grade: A+DVD Grade: B+"
1,Apocalypse,"The dvd was in great condition. But I did not like the movie because of the way it was filmed. It did not seem like a movie, it was more like a weather report. It did not seem like a movie but it carries a good christian message."
1,so bad,"I had to watch this film in a university class called the Apocalyptic Consciousness. It is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. It exploits the tragedies in the stock footage it uses, the acting is terrible, it inspires xenophobia, and contains several shameless plugs for Jack van Impe, a self-proclaimed Ph.d. Don't waste your time watching this movie, and certainly don't waste your money to buy it."
2,"Funny, but not intentionally","If someone made a satire of Christian Fundamentalist movies, it wouldn't be any different from this. This movie captures the essence of fanatical religious paranoia with hammy acting and God-awful writing. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because it's actually pretty funny, though it's not trying to be."
3,good storyline - soap opera style camera work and acting,"I've watched Left Behind, Left Behind II: Tribulation Force, Revelation, Megiddo: The Omega Code 2 and now Apocalypse. Apocalypse is another one of the Cloud Ten Pictures heavily influenced by Jack and Rexella Van Impe who also make cameo appearances on the tv sets in the movie. I really liked Revelation which was like a real major motion picture. Although Apocalypse continues in the tradition of the Left Behind movies, Peter Gerretsen's directing reminds me of Daytime soap operas with their overdramatized acting and cheap videocamera style photography. Seems like a low budget sequel to Left Behind. I mean it's an ok movie but definitely not my favorite."
4,Apocalypse hmm,The story line could have been made more believable. Reviewing the movie and knowing the book Of Revelations will help also having a bit of imagination to help the actors along in the film.
2,The One that Started It All,"I always wonder how a film is shot on video tape, but what do I know. But considering that they are two different mediums entirely..one made up of cels and the other entirely electronic...then the pre-title ""A Peter and Paul LaLonde Film"" is kind or a misnomer or an outright misrepresentation, or lie, depending on how you look at it. But it is actually a pretty good drama shot on video tape (and not digital video mind you.) The use of actual footage from around the world of actual disasters captured on video is kind of exploitative but then again, Cloud Ten are the modern day kings of exploitation.The productions really does succeed though and should be highly praised for this. It really has a strange fascinating realism that is quite compelling. I don't find that I like it as much on repeated viewings though. The sequels stand up a lot better."
5,WAKE-UP CALL!,"This movie was great! We watched it with our kids who are teenagers and they loved it. As a matter of fact they enjoyed it so much, the private school they attend showed it to the students! I would suggest getting this movie to show Sunday School Classes, Youth Groups,etc. The movie is scripturally sound, and really wakes you up to the very near return of Jesus Christ. I would suggest it not only to Christians, but non-believers also. It is a great eye-opener! The acting is great and the music is marvelous! We really really enjoyed this one."
1,This was broken,I was dissapointed with this movie due to the fact that when I received it I went to put it in my VCR to watch it that night and my VCR would not play it. My VCR kept ejecting it so I looked over the tape and relized that the tape itself was broken. You take chances when ordering through the internet. This will not keep me from purchasing on the internet. It's not worth sending back because I paid so little for it.
4,EXCELLENT,Excellent portrayal of the end times. Top Actors. Worth watching only if one is aware of some of what is written in the Book of Revelation. This gives Apocalypse more meaning.
3,Great compilation but a lot of great songs were missing,"When I saw this box set I was excited to see what are the songs included to this set. After reviewing the list, I was kind of disappointed. A lot of good songs were left off like fly people fly, this is my song, far away, life's like a river, living and dying, evening wind, yellow raven, born to touch your feelings, sails of charon, always somewhere, lady starlight, when the smoke is going down, you give me all i need, now. Maybe you should buy the import best of the ballads cd and this box set and you get the essential scorpions. But overall this is a good box set not complete though."
4,This is a fun set of Scorpions music,"After reading several of the positive and negative reviews of this compilation I have a different way of reviewing this ""box set"". Some were critical of the fact that it isn't really a ""box"", some were critical of the song selection, or the mastering (which is important), and some were saying that it is okay for the casual Scorpions fan but not the serious fan because of the lack of extras or B sides. But for an older, serious fan of the Scorpions like me who had most of the albums on vinyl and who doesn't want to deal with that format anymore, this is a great way to get a comprehensive set of Scorpions music on CD without having to replace all the LP's with CD's. I know that having the individual CD's is great because most of the songs that didn't make the top 40 or top 10 are some of the best songs available from any group but for $40 this is a great collection. Just remember to have fun with it and enjoy the music!!"
5,So the Scorpions probably have more greatest hits albums than they have studio albums,"Okay, so the Scorpions probably have more greatest hits albums than they have studio albums, but this is their first three disc collection. Unlike previous compilations, not only are the big hits included, but also the early material before the Scorps broke in the US. Only the Scorpions would include new songs from previous hits collections. There version of ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" with an orchestra is simply awesome. The older stuff might be a bit rough to handle for some."
3,"camera is fine, but the lens is dead after two year","The camera is a little heavy but well built. Layout of controls is good and it's easy to manipulate. I enjoyed this camera a lot in the first two years and got good pictures. However, autofocus of the lens had problem a year ago. At begining, it could not find focus at telephoto. The motor kept busy and you cannot press shutter down. Now it refuses to autofocus even at wide angle. So far, the lens works fine manully."
5,Great acting and story!,"I thought the movie was great, exciting and on the edge of my seat, type of movie. Quinn Riley, & Michael Barclay, did an excellent job, and let's not forget the neighbor played by Joe Navarra, what a character! Milco Davis knew his character well. This was a well done movie and I will be watching it over and over. Thanks"
5,Get your money's worth!!,"Quinn Riley did a fantastic job on her first effort in making movies! There are movies out there that spent 100 times the money, and didn't do as complete, and honest an effort as she did! Hurry up Quinn, make some more!!"
5,great,"great service, product exactly as described and arrived in a very timely manner. thanks have been looking all over for these"
4,An economical and efficient alternative to slide boxes.,"Since I am scanning and organizing my collection of slides anyway, I thought I'd pick these up to replace some of the beat-up boxes some of my slides live in now.Using these to store slides in binders will be more economical than archival file boxes, and makes them easier to view with less handling. Slides fit snugly, and the sleeves appear to be of very good quality material.And my slides are happier!"
1,"Wonderful music, unacceptable pressing","Beware! The music on this classic fifties album is great and so is the sound (remastered by Bernie Grundman) but what really, really is a big annoying disappointment is the pressing of the two 45 RPM LP's. Manufactured by Record Technologies, Inc, which sounds great for a High Quality pressing plant, but pops and clicks like you wouldn't believe. Just a casual glance at the surface of the records is enough to give you hyperventilation. Considering the price of this product and the attention the Boxstar label has given to this release, it is a shame that the pressing is completely unacceptable. I have #0083 of this limited edition and I wish other customers the best of luck should they decide to buy this album."
5,Very Nice,Very nice reissue of this classic Julie London album. The only minus is that they didn't use the original issue back cover but a later version.
1,Not Impressed with this Reissue,"For $49.99 I expect much more. First, two of the tracks (side 3, tracks 2 and 3) have enough surface noise to make those songs almost unlistenable. Second, and this is my taste and not a problem with the recording, I found the sound of London's voice unnatural. It suffers from hyperresonance-- it's way over the top. I love the album but wished I had not gotten this particular reissue. I wrote to Boxstar Records about both issues a few days ago and have yet to get a response. Will update this review when/if I hear back."
2,sinamon NOT green tea,its not a green tea it just teast like hot milk with sinamonNOT green tea latte
5,DOESN'T GET BETTER,SHERWOOD HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME..ITS SEEMS THAT NEWCASTLE IS THERE HIGHER END STUFF...ONLY ONE STORE HAD IT..WHEN LISTING IT PUT SOME OF THE BIG BOYS (500-600) UNDER THE CARPET.. EASY TO USE GREAT POWER AND A SOUND THAT WILL WOW YOU..IF YOU LOOK AROUND YOU CAN FIND THIS BRAND NEW FOR UNDER 200.00..NO BRAINER
4,forever fleetwood,"This album has all the songs that made HS memorable (I'm dating myself!) Just a good sing along album for classic rock ... except, ""Tusk"" of course!!"
4,Fleetwood Mac Forever,"I loved everyone song on this album. The choices were all great to make up this collection. However, I feel like it missed a few of the essential Mac songs."
3,Avoid,"This has been replaced by the 2-CD ""Very Best of Fleetwood Mac"", which only costs a little more, but has many more tracks, including some extremely popular songs like ""Landslide"" and ""Second Hand News"" that are strangely missing on this ""Greatest Hits"". Also the new collection features much better sound quality."
5,The Fleetwood Mac Hit Machine,"Released in 1988, this Fleetwood Mac compilation features all the smash hits and, with the exception of ""Rumours,"" represents the group's finest album. Worth having for the unedited ""Rhiannon"" and ""Sara"" - not to mention the always-thrilling ""Tusk,"" ""Say You Love Me"" and ""Go Your Own Way."" The CD still omits the U.S. Top 20 singles ""Think About Me"" and ""Seven Wonders,"" but Christine McVie's ""As Long As You Follow"" is a keeper. An ideal starting point for the uninitiated listener."
5,Great for the beginning Fleetwood Mac fan.,This CD is perfect for anyone who would like to obtain the best of Fleetwood Mac without spending a lot of money. This CD includes most their hits that you would expect to hear on the radio. It gives a great variety of some of their slow music with a spin of their faster pace music. In a nutshell this is a great CD for anyone who is just getting to know Fleetwood Mac. It is also a great CD for someone who might have heard a few of their songs on the radio and would like to hear more. This entire CD is a fantastic example of Fleetwood Mac's greatest hits. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys any of Fleetwood Mac's music.
5,Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits is great!,"Fleetwood Mac's ageless songs are great to hear while driving, or while working. My wife and I have enjoyed the group for years, especially the unique voice of Stevie Nicks."
5,still fresh and new .ageless music.,"Inhave enjoyed the music of Fleetwood Mac for at least ten years.Stevie Nicks is still above the rest of todays female vocalists . Her vocals are beautiful and haunting,powerful and femine . You can tell that the music is from experience not just an idea written down on paper."
2,Even a casual fan will be disappointed,"If all you want is a collection of Fleetwood Mac's hits this one's fine. All the hits are here (from 1975-1988) and if that's all you expect from a greatest hits collection, you won't be disappointed. But even a casual fan of the band (like me) found this to be a little less than I expected. The liner notes are the pits; a behind the scenes look at a 1988 concert (w/o Buckingham) with no insight into the songs in the collection. There aren't even songwriter credits (although there are production credits)! I'm not reviewing the songs here, but the packaging. I feel a band that is this talented and popular deserves a better package for their best material."
2,This is not the complete best of Fleetwood Mac!,"To call this the Best of Fleetwood Mac is a little far-fetched--it does not include any of their hits and great songs from 1967-1974, forgetting the songwriting of Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Bob Welch..It is not a complete so called greatest hits without including the early era--the title should have read-Fleetwood Mac-the best of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. I am not knocking this lineup and I love the songs but my favorite is Fleetwood Mac--the Blues--the Roots. I suggest the Then Play On album to get a really good idea how Fleetwood Mac was before Stevie and Lindsay.. Also, do not forget Bob Welch and Mystery to Me album--another Gem!!!!"
3,MAKE IT LONGER,"REALLY, ""FLEETWOOD MAC"" needs a better SINGLE disk GREATEST HITS CD. This album suffers from ""LACKING"" hits. BELIEVE IT OR NOT,...""they had many more"". What the record label needs to do , is make a single cd of hits (LIKE THE BEATLES, and ELVIS # 1's )...that are 25-30 songs long. REALLY, songs like ""diane,seven wonders, the chain,landslide, golddust women...etc -----NEED TO BE HERE. THEN THEY WILL HAVE A ""GREATEST HITS ALBUM"". This album is a SAMPLER......................yep. (PS) GOOD HITS ALBUMS, HAVE HITS ""BUT THAY HAVE OTHER GOOD SONGS THAT ARE FAN FAVORITES"" ( I WISH ALL RECORD COMPANIES WOULD REMEMBER THAT )"
3,cracked,Product came in a reasonable amount of time but it had two larger than hairline cracks in the case. Fortunately I was able to make the case usable with clear packing tape.
1,I have a friend who is a fan of Fleetwood Mac,"I was occasionally subjected to this music in its time of popularity, in long elevator rides or while looking for something to listen to in my car. It remains, to me, the most insipid of the insipid 70's I guess it appeals to some but then so do our politicians. Bill"
5,The title says it all!,"This collection features 14 previously released tracks from FLEETWOOD MAC,RUMOURS,TUSK,MIRAGE and TANGO IN THE NIGHT,respectively. There are no pre-1975 songs on this album so that means no songs from the Bob Welch era,also before American members Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac. The two original tracks are Christine McVie's and Eddy Quintela's AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW,which was a Top 10 hit, and Nicks' NO QUESTIONS ASKED. This album can afford to be out of print since all tracks except BIG LOVE from the still-in-production TANGO IN THE NIGHT album are on the subsequent compilation THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC. Total playing time for this album is 65 minutes."
5,THE MAC,ESSENTIAL FLEETWOOD MAC I AGREE WITH SEVEN WONDERS SHOULD OF BEEN IN THIS ONE BUT YOU KNOW HOW THEY PUT THESE GREATEST HITS TOGETHER ALWAYS MISSING 1 OR 2 GREAT SONGS THAT WE ALL KNOW SHOULD OF BEEN IN THEM BUT I'M SATISFIED GOOD CD GET IT..
4,Fleetwood Mac: Greatest Hits,CD had a scratch causing a popular song not to play. Overall the product was O K for the price.
5,Remarkable!,"If you are a die hard Fleetwood Mac fan like me, than you will greatly appreciate this album. Being one of my favorite bands, I really appreciated this compolation of all their Greatest Hits. Stevie and Lynsey did a great job of making their music ring into the hearts of their fans, and opening the wider play of folk/pop that they established. For first time listeners, Stevie Nicks will put you through a trance that nobody will do like her. Every song on this album is a hit, and I think the only one it is missing is Landslide, which was recorded after this album was put out."
5,Give Fleetwod Mac credit,"...for including mostly bona-fide, radio played songs in their greatest hits compilation. With the exception of ""No Questions Asked"" (and, perhaps, Christine McVie's sweet but airplay-challenged ballad, ""As Long As You Follow""), every song on this album should be familiar to most classic rock listeners, not just Fleetwood Mac fans. In other words, unlike some groups whose ""Best Of"" compilations include filler among the gems, this one is all gems."
4,Fleetwood Mac,"Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits was of course excellent, but didn't include some of the songs that I had hoped for. I guess some of the songs are solely Stevie and not Fleetwood. I wish they included both!!!!!"
4,Takes me back,"Nice album. I don't like today's raucous ""music"" so this suits me just fine. I loaded it on my Kindle Fire and shuffle it in with my other tracks."
4,Good Choice to Start Your Fleetwood Mac Fandom,"This album contains many of the charted singles Fleetwood Mac had in its Rumours lineup incarnation, but there were several that may or may not have been singles that could be worthy of a Greatest Hits Volume II - ""The Chain,"" ""Second Hand News,"" ""Gold Dust Woman,"" ""Love in Store,"" ""Sisters of the Moon"" from the Mirage video...I remain mystified at some of the choices for the album, such as ""As Long As You Follow"" for one of two new songs on the album, and I'm puzzled about ""Seven Wonders"" missing the cut. But, there are plenty of timeless classics on this album (""Rhiannon,"" ""Dreams"" -their only US #1),""Go Your Own Way,"" and ESPECIALLY ""Gypsy"")."
4,Fleetwood Mac is a good group,"The 70's were before my time, but I have a few cd's from the decade and this is one of them. After hearing ""Hold Me"" and ""Go Your Own Way"" on the radio, I knew I had to have this cd even if they were the only good songs on the whole cd. But while I was listening to the rest of the songs, I found out that just about all of them are good songs. It also had a few other songs that I liked such as ""Rhiannon"" and ""Everywhere."" The ones that I didn't recognize for the most part were almost as good as the ones i did know. ""As Long As You Follow"" and ""Say You Love Me"" became 2 of my favorites from the album.And if that wasn't enough, they included a few bonus tracks that really made it worth the money. ""Big Love"" was the best one of them to me. If you like Fleetwood Mac, then you'll definitely like this cd. And if you're like me and didn't really know who Fleetwood Mac was, this album is a great way to get to know them. From start to end, it's an all around good album."
5,This is still a hot album of their best songs!,"I still say that Fleetwood Mac is one of the greatest pop groups of our time. Their emphasis on songwriting, dramatic musical landscapes, and addictive pop and rhythm section are why I still like them. I still love Stevie Nicks singing the group's songs. I still love Dreams,Rhiannon, Don't Stop, Tusk, Big Love, Everywhere, Little Lies, Gypsy and Sara (those last two sound so very alike, think about it). I like their '88 song on here, As Long as You Follow, very country sounding, more like what Christine McVie is doing on her new solo album. However, there are only two songs I don't and still don't like on here, the last two, Over My Head and No Questions Asked. Those songs sound flat and bland to me; they just don't move me after all that great stuff that came before them. For anyone that hasn't heard them yet, get this album NOW! Classic adult pop songs and gems on here!"
5,fleetwood,One of the best recording fleetwood mac has done if you like the 70's you will enjoy the music.the singing it is great.
4,"Greatest Hits, but not the Best of Fleetwood Mac","I lost most of my Fleetwood Mac in a Burglary a while back, and recently I came across this CD and grabbed it without reading which songs were included.Don't get me wrong, all the songs on the CD are very good, they are I'm sure the biggest hits for the band. It is just that it doesn't have many of the songs that I consider to be the best from the masters of ""Pop Rock"". To name a few of the songs missing here, ""The Chain"" ""Songbird"" ""Crystal"" ""I Go Insane"".However, this set is good enough that I am convinced that I need to buy some of the albums again, and this will tide me over in the mean time."
4,Advanced Accounting by Hoyle,This is a book I needed for my college class. The book is very detailed and contains many advanced accounting concepts. Perfect for adding to your basic accounting knowledge.
4,A Very good book,The book teaches the content better than most CPA review books with a lot of examples. Definitely worth it .
4,Great Resource,"I purchased this textbook for a class at my University. The class was self-study, so I was worried that the the book may difficult to learn from. However, it was organized and pretty good at explanations. I kept it for a reference and have used it several times since."
5,Awesome Sellers!,Book was as described and arrived on time for my advanced accounting class at Eastern Oregon University with Mr. McGraw! Thank-you!
1,A Kindle book that cannot be read on a Kindle?,"I wanted to take a look at the sample edition on my Kindle before making the purchase.When I tried Amazon opened with the message: ""we did not find a Kindle device or reading app registered to your Amazon account for which this content is available"". It will only open on a PC, MAC or iPad, not an actual Kindle, Kindle app, or the Kindle reader in Chrome.Eh???"
5,"Advanced Accounting by Joe Ben Hoyle, Thomas Schaefer, Timothy Doupnik",This book was delivered promptly. I had it in time for class to start. Very easy to follow and understand.
5,Levels of coolness,"Malina reads three very cool writers here -- Samuel Beckett, Christine Brooke-Rose, and Angela Carter. Their challenging novels grow more fascinating as Malina explores their uses of metalepsis.(This is a very useful term from narrative theory. When the characters in the movie ""Pleasantville"" get sucked into the television and start living the lives of '50s sit-com characters -- that's metalepsis. They've left one narrative level and entered another.)Malina shows that these writers have been playing sophisticated versions of this game for years. Metalepsis gives their novels uncanny power to invade a reader's life, and it raises wild questions about the political potential of fiction -- and the nature of reality itself.Coolness, in short."
2,"Great for sliding, not for protecting","I used these on my dining room chairs, but I ended up replacing them with good ol' felt pads. The sliders are easy to install and seem a perfect solution for skinny-leg chairs, but I was hoping to prevent my beech wood floor from getting scratched. Say hello to swirly scratches if even a grain of salt gets on the slider because these have a hard surface. Felt pads have crappy adhesive and continuously want to slide off, but it's the only way to keep the scratches down to a minimum. I'm sure these magic sliders will work wonders to move heavy stuff around or to sound-proof wooden chairs on, say a kitchen tile floor, that screams every time you inch a chair. But don't use them if you're worried about scratching the surface beneath."
2,"Stays better than stick-on, but nails come through","We had these on our dining room chairs on a wood floor. They seemed great at first, but over time the nails protruded through the plastic on the back legs, which left terrible marks on the floor. When we moved to another house with a tile floor, the nails squeaked something awful.I recently took them off and the black plastic bit holding the nail was so battered that the edges crumbled easily.So these might be okay for carpet or occasional use, but aren't up to heavy-duty daily dining room usage. That being said, sticky-pad ones never stay put, so I'm still without a good solution."
4,Chair Sliders,Really good. They stay on and don't leave horrible scratch marks on the floorlike so many others do. So happy I switched to these.
5,Magic Siders,I used the magic sliders on heavy kitchen table chairs. They were easy to install and worked great on the tile floor.
1,Utter Garbage,The teflon caps simply cannot be pressed into place atop the plastic fitting as the instructions so wishfully suggest. There is not enough give in the rubber that is suppose to yield when you press the cap on. I wasted my money and my time on this ill-conceived trinket. I have to wonder why there are two pieces to begin with. Couldn't the nail simply be countersunk into a recess within a single piece?Off to the hardware store to see if someone has thought this through any better.
4,Good harmonica but takes in a lot of air,"The sound of this harmonica is very good. The slider is also very smooth. However, one will take time to adjust to this model specially if you are moving from diatonic harmonicas. But once you get used it, it is a pleasure to play this harmonica. One thing that I didn't like about this harmonica is, it takes in a lot of air to play notes (I think it is a fault in my instrument, there is an air leakage) Please ensure that this fault is not there in the harmonica you buy."
4,Good,Sounds are good and the membrane design reduces the chance of sticking reeds.. But the mouthpiece is not as smooth as SCX 64. The design of the front cover is ugly but it doesn't matter if you just care for the sound quality.
5,Gunsmoke DVD,Same as the review for the above product. I am very happy to finally see more of these episodes besold.Thank you.
4,Any Gunsmoke is good,"Once again, this is for my husband and he is pretty happy with all of his Gunsmoke movies. Thank you."
5,Great,"Gunsmoke: The Fifth Season, Vol. 1Go glad I purchased this video for my Western video collection. Always looking for more."
3,Charm Is Not Exactly Like the One Shown,"This advertisement shows a beautiful picture of a Grey Wolf, yet the actual charm itself is a picture of only the head. The colors are off from what you see shown here and there is a gold border around the picture. At first I thought the charm was dirty, creating a fuzzyness to the picture but then I realized there are bubbles in the plastic that protects the picture. You get what you pay for, I guess. Just keep in mind this charm is prettier on-line.Added to 09/22/07 - I noticed the price has been changed on this from $2.99 to $20+. Odd, but unless they improved their quality I wouldn't pay their raised price."
3,Average for the Genre.,"I agree that one can find writing inspiration in these pages. Studying the mechanics and practices of other writers is always enjoyable and enlightening. Sometimes one can find tricks and short cuts to emulate which then enhance one's own work, and that is certainly the case with The Writing Life. The problem that I had with it is due to its selection bias. In my opinion, it chronicled far too many journalists as opposed to outstanding writers. Many of the individuals are not people one considers to be luminaries at all. I picked up The Paris Review's Interviews book which is more satisfying in this regard. Obviously though, this text isn't devoid of value, but it depends on what you wish to use it for."
4,Good Intro to Foucault and Queer Theory,"Michel Foucault's work on sexuality was highly influential in the formation of Queer Theory. This short book gives a readable introduction to Foucault's complex argument, and to the ways in which this argument influenced Queer Theory. It is very succesful in conveying complex theoretical ideas in a clear way, and will be useful as an introduction to be read before, or after, reading Foucault and the ones influenced by him."
4,"old-fashioned, but still one of the most useful textbooks","Originally published in 1962 by the US Foreign Service Institute to help Cold-War-era diplomats learn Hungarian (thus the emphasis in the reading selections on press conferences and embassy cocktail receptions), this is still rated by students as one of the best textbooks available. Although the topical content and the grammatical explanations are both quaintly old-fashioned, this is the only textbook currently in print that has enough drills and exercises to enable a student to learn Hungarian outside of a classroom setting.For more thorough grammatical explanations, students can supplement this textbook with an up-to-date descriptive grammar of Hungarian: _Hungarian_ by I. Kenesei, R.M. Vago & A. Fenyvesi (Routledge, 1997)."
4,Great addition to any libarary,"Mr Lawson's book was beautifully written and shows the reader just how we can go about studying God's word.This book was used in my Bible School Class in which we had to summerize the book and what we thought and felt. I must say that by doing so received an ""A"".Take your time when going through the book. I am sure that you will keep referring back to it every now-and-again."

2,Too corporate studio artist for me.,Every song sounds like Nine Inch Nails (NIN)... that is if NIN was a group hand picked by music corpration executives rather than organically created through word of mouth and having built an audience pre-label.
1,Good Times- The complete second season,"Bought Good Times- the complete second season several months ago for a Christmas present. Bought this item for one show in the set. On Christmas morning when tried to play it,the dvd stopped, no sound, no movement, nothing.Very disappointed."
4,Kid Dynomite!!!,"It is a groundbreaking show, and I am very pleased with the sound and video quality. The colors are very vibrant. But I am very disappointed that the manufacturer didn't put any extras on the DVD. No interviews, nothing. Still, until some better collection comes along, you have to have this if you are interested in seeing a great series and a ground breaking television show for black actors.Haunted Backroads: Central Indiana (and other stories)"
4,Real Issues,"i FOUND THIS SERIES TOO BE ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS, LOVED WATCHING IT. THE BEST OF THE SERIES IS THAT THEY TOUCHED ON ALL ISSUES THAT EVERYONE CAN RELATE TOO AND THAT WERE REAL ISSUES THAT ANYONE WATCHING CAN SAY YES I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS OR I'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT. BEST OF ALL THERE A REAL FAMILY WITH THERE UP'S AND DOWN'S."
2,"the hulk meets "" darkness-powered moffia man.""","the hulk crosses over with the darkness. talk about a swift storyline!!also, i'm sad to say this was one of the worst cross overs i have ever read. not much thought was put into this cross over. not nearly as good as i thought it was going to be. check out my boy supes' ( Superman) when they cross HIM over with the darkness. MUCH MUCH better!! i hope those four, all identical, the darkness action figures are still worth something."
2,Highly repetitive,"Although I enjoyed the bits of philosophy and musings scattered throughout, the book itself was highly repetitive and I found myself skimming quite a bit. Additionally, this book all but presupposes the existence of a god, which I found to be a flaw in the overall ""open"" discussion of the topic."
3,Interesting but...,"Typical of much of the over-simplified, pseudo-philosophy invading the pop-market. While the satire is cute and the musings are fun, they cannot suffice for real thought. An example, ""You win whenever you play chicken with an omniscient being!"" Cute, but the omniscient still wins because, given the knowledge of your predisposition to not turn away, you will never have the opportunity to play chicken with him."
3,In the Beginning,In the Beginning is a biblical two part film made for Television that spans the books of Genesis and Exodus. The production value is great and the special effects are quite good being a film made for television. Martin Landau is great in the role of Abraham. Here the positive praise ends however. Much of the biblical stories have been changed and some changed beyond recognition. Some of the acting is a bit over the top and the last 30 minutes delve into kitsch more then telling a compelling biblical story. An uneven film that gets a 3 out of 5. 3/5.
4,Family viewing at it's best,This movie was a wonderful family movie. It brought about numerous discussions of biblical history. We would very strongly recommend it.
2,Great Beginning...but...not so great after that...,"I originally watched this miniseries when it aired on NBC in the fall of 2000. I specifically remember watching the first 2 hours and realizing I could find a better way to spend my time than sitting through the last two hours.The performances are uniformly mediocre, with only Martin Landau standing out as Abraham. The scenes of creation, including Adam and Eve, as well as the Fall, are quite nicely told through flashback, as Abraham tells the story around a campfire. But, it quickly falls apart after that.If you really want to watch the story of Joseph, Moses, and the rest, I recommend watching the animated films JOSEPH and PRINCE of EGYPT. If you want to watch a classic story of Moses, go with THE TEN COMMANDMENTS--it's a classic that still rates close to 5 stars!"
2,In the Beginning I thought...............,"As I first started to watch this I was really excited, because one of my favorite movies is Moses. As you go along, you see how many important things they cut out and it is so chopped up. Someone who knows nothing about Moses, may enjoy this, but once you have seen Moses with Charlton Heston, this movie does not even begin to match it. The best Actor was Martin Landeau, he was quite good. The rest of it left something to be desired. I guess the funniest part was when Eve ate the fruit, come on, was it really blackberries and not an apple!!!!!!!"
2,Bible Teacher,"This is an interesting and well done video that in my oopinion is good for a basic undrstanding of some of the Old Testament stories. Not a verse by verse study, but entertaining in its presentation. A good DVD for a class that is seeking basic Biblical information."
3,A little disappointed,I had read the book which prompted me to get the DVD. I enjoyed the book far more than the video . The book captured the dog fighting between the Luftwaffe and the RAF as if one was actually in the airplane. The DVD dealt with the Battle of Britain in the air in not so detailed a fashion and the writing did not come across nearly as well as the book. My wife (who had also read the book) and I were somewhat disappointed with the DVD.
1,Finest Hour - The Battle of Britain,"A wonderful account of when England stood alone in 1940. The producers sought out people who had personal and interesting stories to tell during that time. One of those persons told of her harrowing journey together with 90-odd children, whose ship was torpedoed on its way to Canada. She was one of few survivors. An important piece of history extraordinarily told by such courageous people."
3,"One of the better Magic books, which doesn't say much","Although Jedit is one of the better Magic: the Gathering books, it does not carry off it's goal of telling an entertaining tale about the MTG universe. The connection between the book and the Legends cycle current at the time was even weaker than usual in these books, but the story itself was somewhat better. All told, an engaging tale that does not require intimate knowledge of the game world it portrays, but neither does it fully exploit the possibilities of that world."
4,A Elenita le duele M√©xico,"Una ""ficci√≥n hist√≥rica"" de la se√±ora Poniatowska, que lo mismo introduce como personaje a Jos√© Revueltas que a un mundo de cient√≠ficos mexicanos - algunos con sus nombres reales - en un intento de transmitirnos el mundo interior y exterior del voluntarioso Lorenzo De Tena. Seguramente aquellos que son cient√≠ficos, o conocedores de la historia de la ciencia mexicana, saborear√°n el retrato ""ficticio"" que hace esta genial escritora y periodista del (¬ønacimiento del?) M√©xico cient√≠fico de hace unas d√©cadas. Aquellos que no lo somos, a√∫n as√≠ (y quiz√° por eso, pues habremos conocido ""a√∫n otro"" M√©xico) seguramente disfrutaremos la manera como va trazando la personalidad de Lorenzo, sus tropiezos, triunfos y lecciones en el contexto de un M√©xico que le duele a los dos, al protagonista y a la escritora.This book won the 2001 Alfaguara prize for a Novel, something I think should be told somewhere in this site.Get to know -yet- another Mexico."
2,La piel del cielo,"Comienza bien pero luego se torna aburrido. Tuve que esforzarme en terminarlo, por m√°s de una ocasi√≥n estuve a punto de dejarlo."
2,El m√°s d√©bil de los Premios Alfaguara,"En principio el libro promete, pero se va cayendo lentamente. Elena Poniatowska es una periodista excelente (aunque tendenciosa) pero una novelista descuidada. Qu√© diferencia frente a Diablo guardi√°n, de Xavier Velasco! Una distancia de la tierra al cielo, pero al rev√©s."
3,Lorenzo analfabeto computacional ??,"Querida Elena Poniatowska.Leyendo su historia de Lorenzo, de sus pasos para convertirse en el astr'onomo mexicano por excelencia, dos caracter'isticas de su personalidad no me son convincentes. Despu'es de luchar tanto por adquirir conocimiento, como es posible que se haya mantenido al margen de la evoluci'on de la computadora, herramienta fundamental en la ciencia moderna, tanto para c'alculo o para las comunicaciones. El otro aspecto ""increible"", es como una persona de la inteligencia y sensibilidad de Lorenzo, lleve una vida ""privada"" tan rudimentaria, que justamente se hace mas evidente al finalizar el libro. Lorenzo me defraud'o!"
1,Dosn't Work,"Straight from its packaging, it didn't even work. Going through a hassle to get it repaired. Do not shop with Zalmar!!! It is horrrrrible."
5,Standard review,"This album is one of the finest the femmes have recorded, especially the acoustical songs. Then again, all of the femmes albums i've heard are great. If you like the Violent Femmes, you can't go wrong with this album or any of their other albums. Buy this album; buy them all. Why not? Enrich your life and your ear. I don't care. The femmes are great!"
1,"Should more appropriately called ""0""","Their first album was a classic, their second one pretty bad. This thing is horrible."
1,So disappointing,"Everyone who liked the first Violent Femmes album, will be very disappointed when listening to '3'. This album totally misses the energy of the first album.This also leads to the assumption that the reviews are a bit silly, because even [word] albums get 4 or 5 stars from enthousiastic fans. This would make me think that every album is the best ever made. This Violent Femmes album certainly is NOT."
2,Put Me To Sleep,"Competent, but uninspired and boring. The sound quality is marginal even though it's SACD. The piano is miked too far away and is too low in the mix. Spend your money on Oscar Peterson or Bill Evans instead."
2,It's Okay...,"I purchased this programmer and installed it on my 1993 Ford Probe GT, 2.5L V6, 5 speed. All this product does is tap into the mass air flow sensor, and the throttle position sensor. There are many products like this on ebay, that do the same thing and cost a whole lot less. While there are mild, somewhat noticable power gains in the middle gears, between 2nd and 4th gear, it does not seem to have a big effect on takeoff acceleration or any effect on top end performance. Personally, I would not recommend this product as it just doesn't deliver the power and performance it promises."
4,One of the best punk records of 1998?,"Do you like Born Against? Do you like the Jesus Lizard? Do you like Jawbox? Saint James Infirmary appear to be heavily influenced by all three, but have an orignal sound, and a more energetic live band is hard to find. My only complaint is that this album is only 20 or so minutes long (because they wanted the vinyl version to spin at 45 rpm, which is a good move in terms of fidelity), still that 20 minutes is better than just about any record put out last year (releases by godheadSilo, Unsane and At The Drive-In may be exceptions), besides. it's always better to have a band making you want more than wanting less. perhaps more bands could learn from Saint James Infirmary."
4,Most Profound,"Mr Sharon is known to be a most profound and thorough writer. It is obvious a great deal of work was invested in the work which should be read by proffessionals, scholars and everyone who takes interest to the functions which lie in the basis of our daily operations."
3,Still wanted more!,"How do you do a greatest hits CD volume 1, 2 or any number for a band who has spanned so many years? This CD has a good representation of a mid career dirt band but simply left me weanting more and asking where many of my favorite sonds are. I guess that's the risk that comes with the territory, but overall this CD is well worth the price."
4,Good Stuff,"I've always enjoyed the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. They play some great music with nice harmonies and mandolins...yes, mandolins. I'm a sucker for that instrument. This particular greatest hits offering includes some of their biggest hits from the 80's. Just about everybody knows ""Fishin' In The Dark,"" which, in my opinion, is one of the best country songs every placed on vinyl, or a cassette, or a disc. ""I've Been Lookin'"" and ""Baby's Got A Hold On Me"" are also here. Those three songs alone are worth the price of this disc.Other highlights include ""Face On The Cutting Room Floor,"" ""Oh What A Love,"" and ""Down That Road Tonight.""In summary, if you're interested in groups like Shenandoah, Restless Heart, and the Eagles, you'll probably enjoy these guys. They are more country than Restless Heart and the Eagles, but they don't have that forced ""twang"" that lingers on some of Shenandoah's songs.A definite buy."
3,Two More Years of Dirt,"This is the follow up compilation to theTwenty Years of Dirtalbum. It features the bands ""country"" hits that were released in 1987 and 1988, two older hits that were left off the first compilation and two non-hits. It fills in some of the holes, but not all of them, by any means."
5,Another great cd by cards in spokes.,"trying to compare this band to anyone is hard to do. they play fast punk style music, great bass lines, and excellent singing, this is definately worth giving a shot at hearing."
3,Worth a try...,"If you like Jimmy Eat World, the Dropkick Murphys or even New Found Glory, then you'll like these boys!"
4,"Cool, but cuddabeen betta!","As a native New Yawkah & avid Uno player, I was excited to discover and purchase this edition and see what would be portrayed on the cards. Frankly, the photos are lousy, as if someone (actually about 10 nobodies) wanted to prove how artistically they could portray the Big Apple. Postcards these are not. Grimy, gritty real, yeah, sure. But two photos of NYC subway stations - come on! But, okay,SKIP EVERONE is very cool - fuhgedaboutit! If you're from New York, you'll recognize Trinity Church, if not, you wouldn't know if from Adam, as we say. Dah Bwooklin Bwidge is dair, yellow cabs and fire hydrants too, and my friends couldn't stop playing New York Uno - they loved it. It's good, but cudda been bedda."
4,pretty happy with it,"don't understand why so many people complained.it works on both my 2000 and XP system, pretty quite,fast, and not hot.though i doesn't quite favor its ""brick"" appearance."
4,Does exactly what I wanted it to do store files. Lots!,"I bought this in use in conjunction with the Linksys storage Link NSLU2 and it works perfectly. Now, I believe that the USB 2.0 doesn't have the same bandwidth as FireWire, but still the drive works just like I had planned and stores massive amounts of files is 250 GB right now I only have half of it filled and I have more than 20 DVDs on it. So I am psyched!This drive does look cool I mean, it was designed by the guy who designed a Porsche so it's cool, clean lines, sleek and I'm a major geek for saying that about a hard drive sad!These drives are stackable to. They also require an external power sorce.Peace out"
1,Significant Problems,"Several recent reviews have correctly noted that the hard drive has sudden accessibility problems (and runs hot and clicks). Roughly a month after I loaded all of my photographs and videos onto this product as an archive, the drive suddenly will not communicate with the computer. If you run a search on ""troubleshooting"" for LaCie External Hard Drives, you will learn that this is a common problem. I hope you do not make the same mistake that I did. Buy something else."
1,Drivers not updated by La Cie,"Yep. They are a waste of money since they only last for your current OS. One update will kill their usability, since La Cie will not create updated drivers for its customers.This is outrageous corporate behaviour.I have both a La Cie 250 gig storage drive and a La Cie CD burner which will not function at normal speed any more.Slow as molasses, since they need new drivers for OS 10.3 update.My recommendation? DON'T BUY any LA CIE products!"
1,"Worst product, Buy at own risk","I bought this 250GB HD; it was very slow to start with. And one doomed day, after 45 days of purchase it stopped working. I was caught where I couldn't return to the store of purchase. So I called Lacie. Lacie want to return it to them to repair it under manufacturer's warranty. Few days later, got a new one - right on the first day, new one didn't work either. Send again, got a new one - right on the first day, this one didn't work either.When third time isn't a charm, I called Lacie for refund. They don't refund if item not bought direct from them plus even if the item is bought from them it should be less then 30 days. Every time the buyer has to pay for shipping the item to repair.Worst product, Buy at own risk"
1,Is it the manufacturer/model or the software? I don't know.,"This hard drive certainly did not work for me. I've been using large external hard drives for many years for back-ups and have never had trouble copying files to them. Not only was this drive refusing files (character length) but when I decided to use the (confusing) software that came with it, after a lengthy back-up, the drive refused to even mount. If the problem is because I'm Mac-based not PC (that happens a lot!) then I'd like the manufacturer to say 'this product does not perform well with such-and-such operating system...'"
2,Spotty performance & risky for a back up!,"This is on their 80GB external drives. I used one at work for backup successfully for about a year, so bought one for home. It made an unsual disk noise from the start (I should have returned it immediately, in retrospect). After about a year, the home unit starts giving me errors on almost every bulk copy operation. Will only work with a limited amount of files to copy onto it, so I have to do a lot of manual work, & defeats the whole reason I got it for! I'm not happy & wouldn't recommend this brand to anybody. Buy at your own risk!"
1,CompUSA not good,"I returned the drive without opening, so can't rate it. CompUSA did not reveal that they charge sales tax despite no brick-and-mortar in my state, did not confirm purchase until already shipped, did not respond to my complaint/queries until I contacted Amazon. I would have refused delivery but package was left in my absence, with HUGE dent. So I returned. Did receive credit fairly promptly. Will not buy from CompUSA online again.Was disappointed that Amazon support now clearly overseas and not so good."
2,WTF?,"One of two my LaCie 250GB drives bit the dust. It didn't even last a year. I'm glad I have a back up drive, but I'm sweating bullets because all of my digital images are on it. I don't know much about the inner workings of computers, but I just updated to the Tiger OS for my Mac the day before this happened. No noise at all came from the drive. Nothing inside was moving. LaCie is going to repair it, but all the data will be wiped. Buyer beware! Spend some extra cash and get a more reliable drive. Oh yeah, the drive was fairly warm when it went out, while the other one (slightly newer) was good and cool."
1,This drive is worth more as scrap metal.,"I bought this drive re-conditioned, direct from LaCie a week ago. I got it today and have been trying to get my G4 Powerbook to recognize it for several hours. I currently want to draw a target on it's pretty titanium colored top to aim my fist at. There are mixed reviews of either no problems or a garage full all over the Internet. I should have looked at them and bought something else, but it was cheap and I have a limited budget. LaCie customer service is junk, and Apple doesn't have anything obvious on their site about this drive. I will get it to work because I'm stubborn and know enough about my computer, but if you want something that will plug and play with no potential for problems: DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE."
1,"Looks great, horrible drive","When I purchased this drive about 8 months ago, I read some reviewers who had problems with the drive basically self-destructing.Well, about a week ago this drive starts clicking, thankfully I backed up my data in time. Today, I turn it on and it's dead, just making loud clicking noises.I cannot recommend this drive, given that it was pretty slow when it worked. Only thing that attracted me were the looks, but I won't make that mistake again."
1,Does not work after 1 week!,"Bought this product 10 days ago. Initially no problem with may laptop or desktop computer. But three days ago, the drive started cliking and non of the 2 computers would recognize the drive. Tried with Linux or Knoppix and the same problem...I would not recommend this drive! Try other options..."
3,"OK quality, good service","One of its cables has a 4 pin connector. These pins are very delicate and breaks easily, if you tried to force it in. Once my disk stopped responding and I had to send it to the manufacturer in Hillsboro OR. They promptly fixed/replaced the drive at no cost and free shipping!"
5,LaCie HD's used for backups,"I have been using LaCie 250 GB HD's now for over six months with clients who want to have backups that they can take off-site. These Hard Drives are great because you can swap them out (exchange them) just by pulling the plugs out of the back of one, and then plugging them back in the next HD. This makes it very simple to do a rotation with 5 or 6 HD's. This is a great alternative to buying a Tape Backup system. I have been using this system with Veritas Backup Exec 9.1, 10 and 11d with great results. This is a great HD for the price; I have probably purchased about 2 dozen already."
5,LaCie 250 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive ( 300728U ),"I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS LACIE EXT. HARD DRIVE. IT IS EASY TO USE, SMALL IN SCALE, PORTABLE AND HIGHLY EFFICIENT. BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET FOR THE PRICE.RON KOWALKEEMERITUS PROFESSOR OF ARTUNIVERSITY OF HAWAII"
1,"Unreliable, really, just a piece of junk","I have had trouble with almost everything about this drive, but the only thing that matters is that I am very lucky I didn't rely on it for all my backup, because it lost all my data. I wish I'd never purchase it and it is the last product I will ever buy from LaCie."
2,Drives don't last,"Very disappointed in the Lacie Hard Drive. I bought a 250 gb hard drive four years ago. Just after the 3 years were up it went belly-up. Started hemorrhaging files until it lost almost everything. I got it fully reformatted and it lasted another 3 months at most.Unfortunately, another friend of mine bought a Lacie Hard Drive also, and had exactly the same problem as me. 2 for 2 Lacie.Up until the 3 years it lasted fine, but make sure it's not your only source of file storage or you'll be very disappointed."
3,Fine drive - but worthless interface,"I got this drive to use as a backup (I've had it for a couple of years with no problems), and while it works great for what I bought it for I LOATHE the USB 2 interface. I have several Macs that I use this as a backup for - and USB 2 will never equal the performance of even FireWire 400. The theoretical 480mbs is really more like half or 1/3 of that. When I bought this, I expected the USB 2 interface to be slow, but didn't factor in how much better it would have been to buy the FW version or another multi-interface drive (which I eventually did).So if fast transfer speeds are important to you - stay away from this device or spend the extra few bucks to buy the FireWire version. Other than that, the reliability has been fine, and if enclosures are important to you, this is probably the better looking of most external drives out there."
5,external hard drive,Received nearly overnight . . . Works fine. (Did NOT come with any software which others do . . . maybe this does not matter? I have no idea!)
4,LaCie 250 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive,I bought this drive to view movies with my Phillips DVP 5960/37 DVD Player.I hooked up through the usb port and was recognized by the dvd playerright away.Plays all divx xvid mp2 etc. without stuttering or any other problems.As far as noise is concerned I have noticed no problems.I also didnt see any problems with file overhead or heat as one reviewerhas stated.Over all I am very happy with this EHD the only problem is the small shut off
1,only 1 out of 4 are working,"OK, I bought a LaCie 200GB drive, and it ran solid for a month. So I bought 3 more, b/c they were inexpensive and looked nice. One month later, 2 of the drives are saying they are corrupted and are no longer in NFTS format (!) after I'd put 100+GB of info on each. A 3rd never worked and just makes clicking noises (I'm sending it back to LaCie). The 4th I haven't touched since it backed up one of the first 2.I suppose it was a mistake to buy 4 of the same kind. But I've tried these drives on 2 different Windows computers, and first they worked and then they didn't. On both. With multiple cables/USB cords, etc. What a drag.I wish I'd bought a variety of drives."
2,Misery,"I must say this is a do not buy. This is because I have now known five people including I that have all bought this, and they have all stopped working. I contacted La Cie for help, and all they said is: well have a back up for your back up. Then gave me pointers on what I did wrong to why it does not work. Which is kinda of funny b/c they never asked, and just accused. It is cheap for a reason."
3,Inside is Western Digital Enhanced IDE harddrive.,"It's cheap, but it's very fragile. It broke after about 1 year. I opened it with screwdriver, and found that the inside is a WesternDigital Enhanced IDE harddrive made in Malaysia. Just a regular harddrive for desktop, and they put it in the square metalic case designed by Porche. So be careful not to move it around, because it's very fragile."
1,"Run a way, Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Spend $$$","I only gave it 1 Star, because that's the lowest rating allowed.Pros: It's a good night light.Cons: Everything else you would want in a hub - 1) EVERYTHING I plug into it, my Laptop tells me the device would work faster if I bypassed the hub - and it really does slow down my transfers: transferring large files that would take 3 minutes, now take upwards of 20 minutes thru the hub. 2) My mouse would be erratic. 3) With the unit connected to my Laptop, 90% of the time my Laptop would not reboot - had to remove the battery and re-install it for it to reboot. 4) 20-25% of the time, my Laptop would not recognize my external harddrive(s) nor my DVD burner.Has a good nitelite tho."
1,Don't try it with a Vaio,"I wanted to replace my old 4-port with a 7-port, and bought this. It arrived after quite a bit of time. Plugged it into my Vaio, which told me Windows didn't recognize it, then froze. I did a manual shutdown, went through the same thing again, but this time it wouldn't reboot for about ten minutes. Unplugged the hub, it booted just fine. Tried it on our other Vaio, same problem."
2,Extremely Poor Quality,"This product is not very good at all. I bought two, and they worked OK which is why I gave a 2 star and not a 1. The case breaks apart very easily, and it has rainbow lights that are always on. The lights are very bright and the one in the center flashes in many colors all the time. Very annoying... I actually broke it apart and took out all the LEDs with a soldering iron so I didn't have to look at it flashing anymore. It also doesn't provide enough power to charge phones and might have fried some of my peripherals.If you don't want to pay more than a few bucks, then go ahead and buy it because they do work. If you care at all about the quality, spend a few more bucks on something better."
3,Pretty Good for the low price,"<html><title>Pretty Good for the low price</title><h>I love it,</h>just like 2 things, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY(sorry if i spelled that wrong). And it doesn't work very good with my External HD, my computer doesn't even recognize the HD, so yeah those are the cons<h>Pros:</h>Flawless transfer as far as I can tellColorful (not really a pro cut whatever)and made well for the price<h>P,S</h>Seems VERY flimsy but it's actually not it's just the material, the USB ports have a very good hold in both the device and the thing your using it foryup formatted in script but apparently i'm so good at scripting the server at Amazon is mistaking my scripting for itselfsso you can't see the < p> < /p> and < /body > tags</html>"
1,VERY low quality,"This item isn't even woth $1, you are better off spending $10 on a hub that actually works. This thing looked like it was put together by middle school kids at shop class with materials they found in a dumpster. It literally fell apart within 48 hours of using it and seemed unsafe to leave plugged unattended. It's cheap for a reason, leave it at that..."
4,Does What it Advertises,"If you have a Nikon camera body and want to get into macro photography on the cheap, don't bother with anything other than Nikon accessories. This one does exactly what it's advertised to do, and does it well. It has solid metal construction and couples perfectly with camera body and old AI and AI-S lenses. I use this exclusively with old manual focus lenses. 4 out of 5 stars only because of price. Other than that it's a solid piece of specialty gear that will help you get unique photographs."
1,Beware of lens (in)compatibility,"Be aware that these extension tubes do NOT work with DX- or G-type lenses. It took a long to determine why the tubes weren't working on my camera. The Nikon rep had to search for 20 minutes before he finally came up with the relevant information. Since DX and G lenses were all that I had, they extension tubes were useless."
3,Good case histories but no theories for causation,This was a well researched and hauntingly prophetic topic to write about back in 1990. Ewing does a good job of categorizing juvenile offenders and makes a fairly exhaustive search of such murders but he does not advance a psycho-social theory for why these kids lack moral restraint or why the numbers of juvenile murderers are increasing so rapidly. I enjoyed the book as a lit. review type of resource that also documents state legistation regarding the penalties for juveniles but I was disappointed because it does not theorize about motivation or possible prevention of homicides by children. To get into the mind (and genes) of a killer I highly recommend Joel Norris' Serial Killers.
2,Just OK,This books started out with quick synopsis' of different juveniles who have committed horrible murders. Then it just drifts off...Small book. I am sure it would be a quick read but I didn't finish it. I couldn't get into it. I would only recommend this book if you are doing a research paper and need a lot of short examples of juveniles committing murders.
1,Garbage quality BOOTLEG - WHY does Amazon keep letting Televista sell stuff on their site?,"As other reviewers have noted, the picture and sound quality of this DVD are utter crap - but then what would you expect from Televista, one of the premier bootleggers of unauthorized/unlicensed discs? Why Amazon keeps letting this egregious pirate keep selling stuff on this site as if it were legit product is beyond me. BAN ALL TELEVISTA (and Jef Films) releases, Amazon!"
1,"Poor Quality, Overpriced, Over-Hyped Chinese Product.","This is a typical Chinese low-quality product. I would love it if it were of decent quality.This is the roughest blade hinge I have ever experienced. The blade grinds and balks when it is opened or closed. I don't believe I have ever felt such a rough knife hinge. It is even worse than a knife that has been dropped in sand. The blade is decent when new, but is poorly sharpened and dulls quickly, especially where it contacts a cutting board. The corkscrew does work smoothly and seems well-finished. They missed a good design opportunity on the corkscrew by not fitting a folding projection to make it a waiter's corkscrew. Nobody likes the brute-force corkscrews, you know. Many people can't even use them. Leverage is a wonderful thing.The only good thing I can say about this knife is that it is pretty until you use it. It would make a nice gift for someone you knew would not use it, or know the difference."
2,not quite right,"I was all excited when I found this item as it was just what I wanted, a way to cut bread and uncork a bottle at lunch time. The problem is it's really just a big scary pocket knife. I would have made the knife blade rounded and made it out of different type of steel. Upon arrival I found it was made in China; and that's also part of the problem. If it were made in France or Italy I'm sure they would have gotten the form right."
2,Thin Slump!,"If your a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright, Sarah Susanka, and Malcolm Wells then this overpriced book will disappoint you. It shows a bunch (22) of cold, lifeless modern concrete buildings. For me books put out by the Portland Cement Association are much better at a fraction of the cost. If your into Concrete Architecture then add it to your library only if you can pick it up somewhere for 1/4 it's price."
5,Hallelujah!!!,"We received our order today, and I couldn't wait to put it on for my little one. We saw the Creation dvd and it was fabulous! Great flow, wonderful music and vibrant images---it's everything I'd hoped for. I highly recommend this product as an inspirational alternative to those other educational baby lines."
5,Great Advice on Where/How to Invest,"If you're struggling with the where/how to invest question, this book is for you. We started investing through no-load mutual funds, but as our portfolio grew wondered whether we weren't missing out by foregoing expert advice. So we interviewed experts, including most of the usual suspects: stock brokers, investment counselors, and some of the largest US money manager/private banking firms. We met some very bright, helpful investment professionals, but always wondered how much value they could add for their fees. We found Mr. Swedroe's book extremely helpful in assessing the value/effectiveness of professional active management, and in learning how to design and implement passive, indexing based strategies. We highly recommend this book."
4,For Those Who Love Index Funds,"Not for those who are active fund managers. The author makes quite a logical, compelling case to invest in his style. The main thrust is passive managed over active managed funds. He goes through statistics that support his position, and attacks publications who don't support. Like a lot of financial books, it gets a bit bogged in numbers at times, but overall the flow is excellent. It changed my investment approach."
5,"At last, investment advice free from Wall-Street hype.","Continuing the themes of his first book, Swedroe makes the case for investing in passively managed index funds in a way that is both entertaining and instructive. Not only does the author blast away at the Wall Street machinery - whose interests Swedroe shows are not aligned with those of the investor - but he also provides the theory and the practical background to personally tailor your investments for maximum return. It's really quite simple: IF YOU INVEST IN THE MARKETS, YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK."
1,A note of dissent,"In addition to the fact that I, too, felt that I was enduring a commercial for DFA, I was annoyed by the fact that this book is nothing more than a rehash of The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever Need: Index Mutual Funds and Beyond - The Way Smart Money Invests Today, Swedroe's May, 1998 book. He introduces a small number of new studies and illustrations, but if you've read the first book, there's no reason to look at this one."
2,Not very well-written,"The writing style is OK, but not great. Basically this book boils down to repeating over and over again: index funds are the way to go. He presents study after study showing this. I agree with the conclusion, but a couple of his points I think are misleading; mostly, however, they're just not very exciting. Instead of this book, I'd recommend 2 books that are much better written: A Random Walk Down Wall Street covers about the same info, but is more entertaining to read; or Making the Most of Your Money, which covers the same info plus tons of other useful topics."
3,Monkey Business,This magnet is very cute and very fragile. Not practical for holding anything even a small paper.
5,Glad I found these guys.,"I first heard Bag of Toys on the now ever so popular Myspace. Right away I loved their music. Their laid back attitude and surf influenced sound is great. The cd is mellow and would be a perfect soundtrack for going surfing, hanging out by the pool, or driving around the coast. I recommend this band to anyone who like Jack Johnson, Sublime, Ben Harper, G. Love or any other music of that style. Can't wait for another release."
1,It has been several months and I have not yet recieved my order,"I have sent numerous emails in reference to this purchase, to this date I have not recieved my order!!Very disappointed and upset"
2,"Wholly inadequate, glosses over topics, wastes paper","1) The author blithely attempts to cover both XHTML and XML in this book, and does an absolutely horrible job; He tries to cover too much in one text which in my opinion, does a great disservice to the reader. **LOL it's like talking to someone who claims to be an expert in several topics, yet knows only vague generalities which anyone can pick up within five minutes of reading at their local bookstore**2) Lots of time is spent discussing very (basic) HTML tags; might I suggest the visual quickstart guide (5th edition or higher) from Elizabeth Castro.3) If one is serious about learning the ins and outs of XML and all of its technologies, (XSLFO, DTD's, XSLT, XHTML, XML Schema, etc) might I also suggest ""XML Family of Specifications""...its a very dense text, chock full of information, challenging at times, but worth every penny."
5,Worthy of praise,"A well written book, sensitive and thoughtful. Congratulations to the author and publisher for sharing this book with the public and those who are in a time of transition. This is a valuable book and important tool in the recovery process. As the author of another book on coping, ""Shovel It: nature's health plan"" and speaker on this topic, I admire Metzgar's compassion for a topic many avoid discussing. Thumbs up."
5,Really Cute Book About Planes!!!,"My son is three and is just now getting into books, so I went to Amazon and ordered him a bunch and this is one of them. My son likes this book and it keeps his attention, which I wasn't sure it would do. The text is rhyming and the story tells kids all about planes and the airport and what all happens. It actually tells alot of info in a cute way. I like it so much for him, that I found and purchased another book just like this one, but about fire trucks, which my son loves. I would definately recommend this book."
4,"A lot of fun for kids, especially if you are planning to air travel.","Great, easy, fun read. We also love Terrific Trains by the same team. Well written, not one I mind reading over and over."
2,Booklet about airplanes,I was surprised when this book arrived & I saw it was more of a booklet than a book. Just understand what you are buying. This is not a hard cover book. I returned it.
3,just ok,"My 19 month old is crazy for trains and airplane which is why I purchased this book. This story decribed a trip in an airplane which isn't bad it just wasn't what I expected based on the train book in this same series. It spoke about the airport and getting the meal on the plane which is not at all interesting to him. The train book is great, this airplane one is just ok."
5,A master work.,"Well, as all Roman Catholics know, Saint Thomas Aquinas is the greatest theologian of all the times. He wrote several books, and among them it is, of course, his masterpiece,""The Summa Theologica"". But, near the end of his life, he said that everything he wrote was nothing, of no value. He was speaking about the wonderfull revelacions that God gave him and that he felt he couldn't reveal.This book, ""Summa contra Gentiles"", it's also a masterwork and this translation with its commentaries is just wonderfull."
4,Really good!,"I am an Amanda Quick and Catherine Coulter fan-- mainly because of the character development (ie. feisty women, scrumptious men) and lively conversations between characters. FINALLY- an author who has that same magic! I'd give this a five, but there were a couple parts of the book that seemed disjointed. The hero seemed a bit of a wimp to me at first, but he had such integrity and was so kind, that I was willing to overlook that. ;-) The dialogues were great, there wasn't a lot of description of peoples feelings, because it was evident from the dialogues what was going on in their hearts and minds. The book also did a great job of introducing Elizabeth's sisters. I plan to have the entire series and read them again and again."
4,Humorous & Fun to Read,"This is my first Jaclyn Reding book and not my last. The story was enjoyable and fun to read, (the exception of course, being constant wars and terrible suffering between the English and the Scots - it's amazing what humans do to one another). I liked both Douglas and Elizabeth and her very large family, although Douglas in the beginning seemed a little on the passive side, but he came into his own further in the story. The humor and tone of the story reminded me of Arnette Lamb's ""Highland Rogue"". I'm delighted to find another author who writes about Scotland. I just ordered the sequel,""The Adventurer""."
3,Work with it...,"A sort of comedy of manners, full of great gags and zippy one-liners. Either ride along at the authors' fast pace for pure entertainment, or slow yourself down to ponder the touching and sometimes surprising nature of the characters' relationships."
2,UGH!,"Apparently, I was not reading the same book as the other reviewers.I hated this book. Although the premise was supposed to be funny, it felt forced and cruel to me.I usually like chick lit mixed in with weight issues. I am a fan, however, this book just made me gag.It felt cruel and mean-spirited and it took all I had just to get through it.Do not recommend at all."
3,Several hauntingly beautiful cuts.,"Ofra's stunning vocal talent is showcased in the traditional style Isreali songs. There are several disco songs that are reminiscent of a young Madonna, that detract from the mystical feeling of this collection."
3,Her vocals always shine out and the grooves are infectious.,"I came upon this album almost by accident ten years ago when it was first released. I am not normally a fan of dance music, but I do like a good rhythm, good production, and good vocals, all of which are found here. All the comparisons to Madonna are appropriate but I would rather listen to Ofra anytime. 'Shaday' is easliy the best track for me. Touching and haunting, its ponderous beat brings all the disconess back down to Earth and reminds us that all the programming aside, this is good music."
5,My favorite,"This CD is worth the cost just to hear the acapella recording of ""Love Song."" I have ""Yemenite Songs"" and ""Kirya,"" both excellent CDs, but ""Shaday"" is easily my favorite. Ofra Haza was ahead of her time and her music is still fabulous almost two decades later."
5,The voice of an angel,"The first time I heard Ofra Haza was on MTV, believe it or not. They had a short piece about the release of this album and they played about 20 seconds of a song. That's all I needed to hear. That incredible voice, conjuring images of the desert, really struck me. I immediately went out and bought ""Shaday,"" and have loved it, and the rest of her music, ever since. Her voice was so incredibly beautiful that it could move one to tears. I've never heard a voice so heavenly before, or since. I suspect I never will. Her death was so sad, and not just because it silenced such an incredible talent. The real tragedy lay in that the stigma attached to her illness caused her such fear that she didn't seek treatment until it was too late. If it hadn't been for that, she might still be with us today. Ofra Haza possessed so much natural talent, and had such a beautiful voice, that anyone who likes music will enjoy listening to her, no matter the genre."
4,"More like a drama being a comedy, but good","Well, you have to admit that once you see it, you get sort of used to Star Trek, even though there have only been four episodes. The best one of these four is Where No Man Has Gone Before, but if you're not satisfied with the way that episode goes, Mudd's Women probably substitutes a bit. Now, if you don't like the beginning, I don't blame you. I didn't really like it either. But please, don't forward it. Any second it's going to get good. I just can't remember when, except that it's like any other episode or movie, it gets better as time passes. If you think about this movie having that characteristic, you're sure to like it. And also, if you think this movie is about stuff like kissing, it's not. I hope that'll be a relief to you."
4,Captain Kirk versus the Space Hookers,"I've read that this episode was to be called ""Space Hookers"" at one time, but that idea was axed early on. One of the first season episodes of Star Trek. You should notice that the women are not today's ""anorexic"" type women, but good-old 60's wholesome women with meat on their bones. This is a fun episode, anyway, and I found myself checking out Uhura's sexy legs that were on display courtesy of her very short uniform! (yum)"
1,horrid vocals,These vocals are laughable- I love prog music- dont get me wrong- BUT THIS IS ALMOST A JOKE!!! If you disagree- call me at 559-392-1587- my name is Kevin- HORRID MUSIC
5,This is the Right Stuff!,"""Palm Records has produced a delightful mix of traditional and contemporary island hulas, that combine the talents of some award-winning Big Island artists. The collection of NEW RECORDINGS is produced by Grammy Award winner, Charles Michael Brotman, and has the ""right stuff"" to keep hula fans smiling and dancing."" - honu.net posted by fanaddicts"
3,Okay,"I wan't quite sure what to expect from this movie. The concept for the story was a great idea, but for some reason after watching it, I felt like there was something missing. Some parts of the movie seemed rushed, like he (Jason Behr's character) doesn't want help from this woman on getting his life together, and keeps pushing her away, then suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, he does want her help, and there's almost no hinting in the story line to show him ""warming up"" to this person. If a friend asked me what I though about the movie, I would say is was just ""okay"" nothing amazing here, not really a stand out performance from any of the actors, but the story itself was a good idea, I just don't think it was funny executed here."
4,Cold Steel FTW!,"Great warhammer. I can't recommend this thing enough. It busts up cinder blocks like a sledgehammer and I can't imagine anything that could stop that wicked spike! Only gave it four star because the hickory handle is a bit splintery, but you should wear gloves when using this anyway, so no biggie. You want a sturdy and fun weapon to wield look no further."
3,Meh,"The shaft came unfinished and very splintery, came disassembled (and hardware wasn't even included), but otherwise serves it's purpose: a more expensive, over-sized hammer with a finish that you can rub off with your finger nail.The head is designed to be held in with a small bolt (again, not even included). If you plan on doing any ""real"" damage with this, a screw is a terrible idea. It'll chew up the shaft, the head will become loose (very dangerous with the gigantic spike on it), and has a small head with an equally small weight/damage ratio.Buy a proper sledge hammer, with the head permanently affixed to the shaft. It's many times safer, and more efficient.Buy it to hang on the wall, or to show off to your dumb friends"
3,Less than elegant,"As far as basic ideas of automata goes, this book will do. It's not phenomenal, and it's not awful. It is merely sufficient. The main problem is that it lacks elegance in a number of places. In many places, it feels sloppy. Definitions are almost arbitrary, and often lack rigor. Techniques are long, tedious, and not very interesting. (This is nowhere more evident that the finite automaton -> regular expression conversion from Ch. 4, which has a really neat solution that this book does NOT give.) Yet, despite all this, it conveys the important ideas nevertheless.As far as developing skills for more advanced concepts of theory of computation, things don't look so good. This book's approach can be described as attempting, by sheer force, to make automata problems fit into rather vanilla proof techniques that readers will probably have already learned. The result is likely to do little more than convince readers that the subject is hard."
3,The explanations could have been better,"The material covered in this book, if you expected to prove what you are doing is correct, is challenging. There were several times in this book, where the explanation from the book was not enough for me to grasp the concept. I am not talking about cramming for the test, I am talking about repeatedly reviewing the concept in the book over several days before giving up and going for extra help.This is surprising, not because of my shear genius, but because the concepts in the book are not all that hard to grasp after the fact. For this reason, I think the book could be better written, by either including examples of more of the concepts or clearer language explaining the concepts."
1,Terrible book,"This book is awful. Hard to follow along with the reading. Poor examples, lacking and skipping many steps when there actually is an example. Answers to a few of the questions would have been nice, to know if the problems were done correctly. Must be a master of discrete mathmatics to have any understanding what is going on. I have seen many better books."
5,Breadth Of Information,"I normally don't write reviews. Couple of not very positive reviews could not stop me writing one for this title. In my opinion, this book really presents a breadth of informationon the subject. If one is considering to buy this book, one should have due background in Discrete Mathematics."
5,Excellent Book for Knowledge of the Theory of Langauages,Excellent stuff in the book from introduction to the theory of langauges to the actual fundamentals with emphasis on details. The problems that are solved give a good idea of the relevant subject and help in understanding the concept better. An excellent book for an undergraduate course in the Theory of Finite Automaton and Theory of Languages.
2,You need a camel to get through this one!,"`The Frontier War for American Independence' is a barren desert of a book with nary an oasis of refreshment between its covers. The subject matter is both important and potentially fascinating, but Mr. Nester has no sense of its inherent drama, and cannot weave an interesting tale even from this, the most promising of material. He approaches it with all the skill of a high school phys-ed teacher who is expected to teach a history class on the side. There is some useful information on the subject here for the reader intrepid enough to brave the daunting Sahara of Mr. Nester's prose, (thus two stars rather than one) but it is not a journey that I recommend that you undertake.Theo Logos"
2,Big Disappointment,"This book could have been alot better. I read these online reviews cause I was dying to read another Love Stories book and when I read these reviews, I thought the book was going to be cool, but I was so wrong. The only way this book is sad is that I actually wasted my money buying it. The plot is very unrealistic and stupid. I have read much better."
5,Much better than the picture !!!,Don't go by the photo on Amazon.com. They fit perfectly and they looks GREAT !!!They are not as thick as I thought but they come with a lifetime warranty.
4,I like these cookies sheets.,"I have three of these cookies sheets. 1 large and 2 small. I use one of the small ones in the camper and the other two at home. Some things stick, but not everything. Easy to clean and sturdy."
5,Great CD!!!!,"I love all of the songs on this CD. Not a situation where you buy the CD and only like one or two songs. ALL of these songs are great!! I love the Mississippi Mass Choir. I am a lover of traditional gospel rather than contemporary, and this fits the bill. Received product in very timely manner. Pleased with service. Thanks!!!"
5,GCF is a must have!,"Big Jess and MaD SoN (of Unknown Prophets) have released solo albums in 2004. ""GCF"" is a fun hip-hop ride through the mind of Jess. Great CD, as is MaD SoN's ""Peace Amongst the MaDness"". Get these CDs to hold you over until ""Against the Grain"" drops!!!"
1,Pointless DVD,"Since when do they put out DVD's for teams who only make the playoffs? I'm a little confused, because the way I remember it, this Mets team won jack squat. Mets suck!"
2,Who determines who's the greatest?,"As a former US soldier now civil service employee stationed overseas, I was excited to purchase this video on a visit to the States. The local economy nor the Exchange sell such an item, so that added to my thrill. Well once I viewed the video I was surprised to find no footage of O J Simpson, just career stats. Contrary to 1994 and all the media hype surrounding his ex-wife's grusome death, O J was the measuring stick that all running backs were measured. I think the person or persons who put this video together aught to be ashamed of themselves for snubbing the first player to rush for 2000 yards in a season. All that I can say is that films do not lie and he is definately one of the top 5 running backs ever to put a uniform on."
1,Tastes like you licked a goat!,"I made up a smoothie this morning with our new Goatein. I used Almond Milk, Goatein and some berries. The initial taste was fine, but then the goat taste settled in. Maybe it's just our lack of experience with goat products, but I'm telling you the taste was exactly like the smell of our goats and it's not a pleasant smell... Probably a great product if you can't handle any other milk products, but we'll pass on this! 4 people in our house tried it and couldn't stand it. I tried and tried to finish my shake hoping I would get used to it, but I had to give up."
3,"""Goatein does not utilize our Poten-Zyme Fermentation Process.""","My doctor had recommended this for my baby who is having problems with cow's milk protein formulas. After I ordered it, I read a couple of Amazon reviews that said Goatein is no longer fermented. I wrote the company, Garden of Life, and their reply was, ""Goatein does not utilize our Poten-Zyme Fermentation Process."" As an alternative, I have ordered the Mt. Capra Caprotein which is fermented. Hopefully my baby will transition to it well."
3,live Who,It was ok but the sound was pretty bad the video was good.The best part was when Roger Daltry got his mic cord tangled in the cord of Peter Townsend's.
2,Poor quality,This appears to be a poor copy taken directly from a VHS tape source. Sound is atrocious.
4,Takes some getting used to,"This is a good product, but takes some getting used to. It also took up more room than I thought it would. It does work great once you used to it. The parts don't ALWAYS slide on to each other as easily as they could. I would recommend this, but have a feeling someone will take this design and improve on it in the future."
2,Not great. Over-engineered.,"This thing works, but it's more difficult to use than it needs to be. These are basically long-armed hangers that collapse into 3 pieces, but it's not easy to snap them together or to take them apart. I'm disappointed with it for the price."
5,Some great plays here,"This is an excellent selection of plays from authors contemporary to Shakespeare. There are some real masterpieces here, such as Women Beware Women and the Maid's Tragedy, that have been unfairly neglected due to the looming presence of Shakespeare. The editing is generally fine, although perhaps a bit overdone. According to the editors, every second line includes a sexual reference. The introductions to individual plays are helpful AFTER you've read the play. For English Majors and scholars, these plays are an unexplored gold mine!!"
5,Excellent and much needed resource,"Many of the important plays of Shakespeare's contemporaries are included in this excellent collection. In other editions of these plays, the reader is left to his or her own devices, but this edition has thorough notes and introductions of the type one usually only sees in Shakespeare collections. Plays that one has often read about, but not actually read, such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, become wonderfully accessible in this superb edition."
4,"Very good, but...","This is an excellent anthology--good selection, fine editing, helpful notes, BUT it is printed on incredibly light-weight paper. So much so that it can be hard to read because the printing from the other side of the page always shows through."
1,this album completely sucks- 0 frigin' stars,this album f___ing sucks. this band should kill themselves and do us all a favor.
5,Wonderful and Insightful,"This story is about true love, but also about how perseverence and happenstance collide to fulfil the yearning heart and spirit. The story also provides a glimpse into the beauty of the Tibetan culture. Certainly not in the category of Harlequin novels! Absolutely a beautiful read!"
4,Circle of Courage,"An accurate story of Platoon and Company MLR action in the Korean War by a soldier who lived the choices that were made. His CO of L Company, 179th, 45th ID was James R. Pierce, Jr.USMA. LT Pierce was KIA at outpost Erie, T-Bone Hill, pages13-51 of this book He was the son of Genral James Peirce, ADC 101st Abn Div under who I served inder with the 506th PIR, 101st AID. My letter to Al Chamberlin and General Pierce's letter to me are avaiable upon request by mail or e-mail. (creb@mail2.gcnet.net)"
3,I don't watch this show,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my Dad. I don't watch this, I can't give you my own opinion, But my Dad always tells me how great the show it."
5,Continental Club & Saxon Pub in Your Livingroom,"If you aren't in Austin with a chance to go see Jon Dee at the Continental Club or the Saxon Pub, you'll need this to feed your jones. The production by Charlie Sexton is flawless and this is the gruff and gravelly fellow in 3D. I listen to this at home in New Orleans and then, sometimes, I just need to jump in the car and drive the 500 miles to see him live in Austin. Companion pieces would be by Alejandro Escovedo. And take a look into the past and ""gift"" yourself a copy of Charlie Sexton's Under The Wishing Tree."
4,Interesting songs from around the world,"We bought this CD for our baby loving the idea of him falling asleep to international lullabies. It is a nice CD with mostly beautiful songs on it. However, our baby prefers another lullaby CD we have, and those are just Africa lullabies. Far more relaxing. There are a couple songs on this CD that aren't so relaxing and bedtime-oriented. But, for the most part, it is lovely."
3,Not bad for use between the Pro Bowl and Training Camp,"Not a bad glimpse at NFL 2000 and the Baltimore-NYG SB XXXV. It doesn't quite live up to it's title, though, as the on-line editorial review suggests. While the camera-work and the interactive features and the great audio make for an ""entertaining-enough"" hour, I was hoping for an inside look at the NFL. What I got was a very glamorous version of ""NFL Presents."" I was hoping to spend more time in the locker room, on the practice field, in meetings, watching film, and in the huddle. Yes, Peyton Manning broke down ONE play --- but if you are a serious football fan and want to learn things about the NFL game that you don't know already, then this DVD is not for you. Unless you just can't stand the off-season like me! If you are a casual fan or, hey, maybe you're trying to get your spouse interested in the game, then this might be a keeper. High on quality, Low on the INSIDER angle."
3,entertaining but not very deep,you may watch this a couple of times if you need an off-season fix but there not much to it.
3,Mom,I bought this coverall to protect me from pesticide that I needed to spray on my peach tree. As soon as I put it on and tried to zip it the zipper broke. I had to tape it up to use it. Other than that it worked fine and protected me from the spray mist. I am a size 12 and it fit fine with room to spare.
1,Poorly Made!,"This product is not worth the cash at all. It's poorly made, not durable, the zipper popped off the track and broke, and the manufacturer's should be ashamed for putting out such a shabby suit. I was not happy with this purchase at all. Do yourself a favor and go with another brand."
3,YOU GET YOU PAY FOR,The material on these coveralls is VERY thin and tore the first time they were worn. I guess you cant expect much for $10.
4,Disposable protection coveralls,"Product arrived on time. Being ""one size fits all"" is an advantage. However, it does not include booties which would need to be purchased separately. Product seems adequate for painting, fiberglass installation, crawing under house during dry conditions. An Amazon Merchant offers a similiar suit which has booties CONNECTED SEAMLESSLY to the rest of the suit (Dupont Tyvek Coverall Suit 1414) which was better for crawling under a house in wet conditions, giving more protection from mold & insects."
4,"Good Quality, OK Fit For Me - Recommended","These disposable coveralls are a decent value and better than expected quality. We picked up four of these since we are in the process of cleaning out our basement and attic, with both having a good bit of fiberglass insulation to be removed. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Fits Most Sizes; I am 5'10"" at 210 pounds and these fit over my jeans and t-shirt, perhaps a little tight but not in danger of ripping with normal movement+ Good Protection; material protects my clothing well, has a hood and the elastic around the wrists and ankles makes a good seal+ Durable (within reason); can be worn multiple times, if care is taken removing it and without stressing the zipperCons -- Hot; material doesn't ""breath"", holding body heat and sweat moistureWe will likely be picking up more of these for future projects.Recommended!CFH"
5,Movie prop,I used this suit as a movie prop with a chemical mask and it really sold the effect that I was going for. Great price for that purpose.
3,Costume maker,These coveralls were fine but were not useable for my need. The plastic made them to hot to wear for any length of time.
1,Dont waste your money,"The zipper was so weak it broke the first time I used it, your better of going to Lowe's and paying a little more."
5,Not at all easy to read for a parent,"Very powerful stuff! For those of you who are not familar with Dolto, let me tell you she is very famous in France (this will turn off those that need to be). One must understand and accept Freud and psychotherapy before even considering the book. Otherwise it will be a waste. Being midwestern, it will never be discussed here.The case study is really comprehensive, almost unbelievable unless you have witnessed the effects of psychoanalysis in someone's life.For a parent, it is a stunning reminder that simply being there for a child is NOT necessarily good for them. One must understand themselves and the process of development (even the arrested process into adulthood). The effects of siblings, parents, symbolism and of course imaginery and identification is absolutely profound.Cannot wait to find more Englisg versions of her work."
2,Editor is Factually Challenged,"Lemon, the editor of this work, has been engaged in a high-profile debate with philosopher Christina Hoff Sommers over the past six months regarding factual errors in this book. As a result, Lemon (a lecturer at Berkeley's law school) has publicly made a fool of herself by insisting on the historicity of Romulus as the ""first king of Rome,"" and employing blatant logical fallacies to justify misrepresentations of statistical data in her book. (Most high school Latin students learn early in their studies that Romulus was a mythical figure fathered by Mars and suckled by a she-wolf, but Lemon stubbornly argued that Romulus was a real person who wrote laws authorizing men to beat their wives!) Lemon's unfortunate forays into the fields of ancient history and medical statistics have brought embarrassment to Berkeley and its law school."
2,Prefer Medela's Nipple Shield,"I was given the Medela nipple shield in the hospital, but after a few weeks of use I was scared that I might lose or damage it and be unable to breastfeed my baby. I went to the store to buy a back up nipple shield. I bought the AVENT nipple shield because I got 2 for the price of 1 Medela one.I love my Medela nipple shield much better! Here are the differences:1) AVENT is much stiffer2) AVENT hurts to put on (not horribly bad)3) AVENT does not stay on as wellI still have the AVENT in my diaper bag incase of an emergency, but I would rather not use it. I am still using my Medela nipple shield (3 months strong!)"
2,"Good idea, hard to use","Nipple shields in general are hard to use, but these were nearly impossible. It's a great idea to have so much open space to allow for more mouth to skin contact from the baby, but I just couldn't get them to stay on because there was so little area around the shield. If you're a pro at using shields, then these are probably great. I just couldn't get the hang of them."
1,to big for baby,For my last child I had to use nipple shields for a while and they worked fine. I don't know if my experience is unique- but I just ordered these with my second child and they were far to big for her- they made her gag. Could not continue use of product.
2,"Good Price, Not a Great Product","The Avent Nipple protectors encapsulate the word ""functional."" They do their function; however, they are thick, large, and cause my baby to nurse harder. Unlike the Medela nipple shield that give size options and offer a much thinner, more supple plastic, these Avent protectors are one size and feel terrible. Their great upside is the price, which is basically half of the higher quality, better designed Medela guards. I would recommend these as backups or money savers. But you what you save in money, you lose in design and comfort."
5,Best Nipple Shields,These were my favorite nipple shields by far! I tried the Medela brand prior and always had trouble with it staying in place. The Avent nipple shields allow more of your skin to touch baby and they are soooo much more afordable which enabled me to purchase more so that I had a few to get me through night time feedings. Also very durable and didn't seem to get as flimsy as the Medela with repeated washing & sterilizing.
4,Scienfitic oration,"Text-book type read of the history of uncovering some of the pyramids of Tucum. Thor Hyerdal's chapters are interesting narratives, the others are very scientific and factual but reads like a text book - which is well written but I was expecting more of a narrative type book. If you want factual info about the pyramids, this is definately the book to get. If you want a good read, you might consider another option."
1,Melted,Spatula melted when frying an egg.The front of the blade just peeled back.I know my pan wasn't over the 400 degree recommendation.
1,Worthless junk,"I have several 15+ year-old nylon spatulas that are a bit stained and scratched but still work fine. This piece of excrement delaminated during the first use. I was cooking on medium heat, well below the 400 degree maximum for this type of utensil. I cannot believe that Calphalon put their name on this worthless piece of junk. While I love their cookware, I will never buy their utensils again! Don't waste your money!"
2,Least favorite spatula I own,"I received a couple of these as a gift a couple of years ago. While they are ok for certain uses such as turning pancakes, I find that I am usually opting for a stiffer and sturdier spatula in my utensil holder when it comes to frying, turning meats and other uses where I need less flexability and a little more strength."
3,Good Buy For the Price,"Lightweight, safe at *low* heat on nonstick surfaces, and I really like the rubber grip. Much easier to handle. I had heard it melted under the stated maximum temperature, but I couldn't resist the price! So far, after 10 or so uses with turning meat, pancakes, etc., I haven't had a problem."
1,Threw It Away,"We had one of these for over a year. We bought it because of the Calphalon name and it is a piece of junk for anything other than turning something super-light and firm like appetizers or bacon. Its too flimsy for eggs, fish, or most meat. Find something else and don't waste your money. We ended up throwing it away to make space for better kitchen tools."
1,It's peeling in less than 6 months,"I have to agree with the reviews that say it's a piece of junk. I've had it for less than 6 months, used it maybe a dozen times and the other day I start seeing black shreds of something in my scrambled eggs. I couldn't believe it was the spatula peeling. I absolutely expected better. Don't waste your money."
5,Super Absorbancy rocks.,"One of my friends had the Spongebob Super Absorbancy deck after school, so out of boredom, we started playing it. The game continued for the longest time and it was great! All of us are addicted now and conspire with each other on those who have uno. :) We've twisted the rules a bit, but it's still great fun. Super absorbancy is really very useful at times! I love this game <3 I don't think I can ever go back to normal Uno again."
1,Most pathetic series of literature to be allowed in schools.,"This book, LIKE ALL OTHERS in the Shelly Cashman Series, does not teach you any useful methods or commands for the product they are trying to 'teach'Nooooo, they have to spend 4 pages at a time on such tasks as...telling you how to open a freaking document, or move the mouse over a button, or even worse...CLICK THE BUTTON! complete with screenshots!I do not reccomend these books for any individual or accedemic institute, simply because A) They don't allow you to think, just follow lame instructions and B) The 'concepts and techniques' they are teaching just are not usefull. There are so many other books that allow students to learn so much more, so I don't know why people bother with these expensive, lame books."
2,Boring,In my opinion it's not possible to learn a martial art from a dvd for a person who never practised at all. DVDs are usefull only when you are a medium or an advanced level practioner. In this dvd the moves are very very basic and does not help to improve your technic.
4,"Overpriced, but great.","I like this cover because it fits the contour changing pad so well. Easy to wash, and the navy color is great for not showing stains. I think they are overpriced, and it's something you could probably make yourself if you have any sewing ability, so for that I gave it four stars. The product itself does its job, no bells or whistles, but great for its purpose."
1,boring saga of dull southern women,"This book is one which should never have been written. Wolfe's writing is almost adequate, but the subject is a loser"
4,good dictionary,"This is a good, complete dictionary. While it may not cover everything, it is rather extensive, and includes sub-entries for words or expressions that utilize the main entry word which is very helpful. It does not, however, teach pronunciation like a phrase book would. The reader is expected to know how to read and speak Cambodian. I would recommend buying a ""learning Cambodian"" book in addition to this book."
3,Dictionary,The dictionary is good but the Cambodian letters are too small.You need very good eyes to read them.
3,This is for people who can read Khmer.,"This dictionary may be good for people familiar with the Khmer alphabet.If you only know the English alphabet, this book will be useless."
4,good basic dictionary,"a good basic dictionary that has Cambodian entries in Khmer script unlike many travellers little dictionaries - exactly what i was looking for, useful for people who want to spend more time in Cambodia or who decide to work there"
3,OK for everyday use...can't find a lot of words,"I have four Cambodian dictionaries, including a CanaTech (digital electronic dictionary). All of them have English-Cambodian. I'm always looking for Khmer-English dictionary that contains vast word count. I bought this dictionary and found that it doesn't have many Khmer words. Many of my search resulted in disappointment. However, it has many useful words that you'll find in day-to-day communication. I believe many Cambodian dictionaries don't contain many poetic or literary words,if at all, which I'm very much interested in, especially those that are found in songs sung by the 60s and 70s artists.It would be very useful if Cambodian-English dictionaries would also contain Cambodian idioms/expressions.I would recommend Oxford Advanced Learner's English-Khmer Dictionary if you're a serious about communicating in Khmer language."
4,Just What I Was Looking For!,I am helping a Cambodian Family learn English. They do not speak any English. This Dictionary has helped immensely!
1,spotty coverage of commonly used words,"Without an ability to review the book personally, I bought it with the hopes that it would be an adequate dictionary for the intermediate ESL student in terms of building rather simple English vocabulary. It was far from my expectation.This is not the book if you are looking for a comprhensive dictionary, nor for quite commonly used words. A big disappointment. Virtually useless. And the size of the font, layout is terrible as well. Even if it contained the basic translations a person would need, you'd have a hard time reading the text. I'd say it is not even adequate for travelers to Cambodia."
2,Not one piece without gouges/scratches and didn't go together right. Real pain!!,"Microwave Cart- CherryThe instructions that came with this piece were horrible!!!! Not ONE of the pieces didn't have some kind of scratch/gouge/imperfection in it and there's nothing that can be done to fix ALL of them. The bottom doors were VERY hard to put in, and once done, still left approx. 1/3-1/2"" gap in between them no matter how much we ""tweaked"" the hinges. Cheap particle board, NO better than the junk you get at Wal Mart. Not at all stable, sways, creaks, etc. and I believe it's only a short time before it just plain falls apart.VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS MICROWAVE CART!!!"
1,Lesson learned: Don't buy from Amazon,"To say I'm disappointed in this microwave stand is an understatement. To begin with, the color doesn't look anything like the picture so doesn't blend with the other cabinets. The pull-out shelf is useless as designed because if you use it you can't use the drawer located beneath it; the doors covering the bottom shelves have a huge gap where they should meet. The only way to know any of this was to open the box and it was marked that product could not be returned if the box had been opened. A complete waste of money & time for someone to assemble it for me - a tough lesson for someone on limited income."
5,works great!,"I've used this almost daily since I've gotten it! My cookie sheets are all getting old and marked up from being used for pizza, fish, drip pans... or whatever else we need at that moment. This baking mat bakes wonderfully... everything just pops off easily and it makes clean up a snap!!! I would highly recommend this to anyone!!!"
4,good for the money,For the price it is a good shifter.There are alot of parts may take a little more time than more expensive models but not bad.
2,Card Reader not Included as advertised,"Product description states that a USB 2.0 card reader is included.I ordered product and it did NOT come with a card reader!To date, Beach Camera has not made good on this issue. What I ordered is not what I received. The product description is incorrect and misleading. Buyer Beware!!"
4,Oatey PVC Saddle,"Easy to install and use. An effective way to tap a 4 inch line for any needed pourpose. Only took an hour from start to fininsh of the project,with this product."
5,life saver,"I had a problem were as I had to pump up to my sanitary sewer with no way of disassembling the main 4 inch pvc.."""" real tight fit"" this item worked great and saved me a lot of time and headache"
2,a little disapointed,"well! honestly i feel that this would have been better if it were just a single of ""HERE COMES THE SUN"" its by far the only song worth having. i find it cool that the songs in the middle of the album are connected and lead into each other but there is nothing there worth remembering. i totally feel that songs like ""MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER"" and ""OCTOPUS'S GARDEN"" can both be added to the list of goofy beatles songs. considering the famous album cover which i love, to most beatles fans, this album should come out as a disapointment."
1,"Best Movie, Got to See it!","This is the best movie you can ever get, its worth the 95 dollars! It is made in New Zealand! It has a naked person swimming in a bath full of flowers, and a wierd lady that is propelled in her trailer in the sky!! Gota see this movie!"
4,really excellent fun for kids,"Kates Surprise is a fun book I loved when I was 12. Kate's friends are acting mysterious because they are planning a surprise party for her,but Kate feels that they are sneaking around without her because they don't like her anymore."
4,Really cute story for 9 or 10 year olds...,"If you are a little girl who loves sleepovers, parties and hanging around with your friends at the mall or pizza place, this is the book for you. You will be able to relate to its fun and silly humour. It is about a group of four girls, Stephanie, Lauren, Patti and Kate who are ""sleepover friends"". For Kate's birthday, the three girls plan a surprise party. Infact, they are spending so much time trying to earn money for the surprise that they are avoiding Kate! Now Kate is angry and the ""sleepover friends"" may be finished! Will the surprise party be enough to win back Kate"
5,great and efficient service,Nice doing business with you..Great delivery time...Many thanks and would recommend to anyone...will use again...
3,Sounded Good,"Upon delivery, the smoothies were already beyond the ""best before"" date by almost two months. This surprised me in that it is listed as a ""new item"" on Amazon. Also note that at the time of this review, Amazon does not list sugar as an ingredient for this flavor, though it does show as an ingredient on the label. While the total sugar is not listed, the calories show as 100 per serving, with 2.5 servings per container. Amazon's customer service was great, offering me either a replacement or refund."
4,"They work well, but not for as long as the originals","I am running 3 humidifiers with these filters. They work well for about the first 2 or so months, but they do not last for a full season. (The OEM filters are more expensive, but I think they last longer.) And yes..., I do know that the instructions say to change them every month, but let's get real - how many of us really do that or can afford to change them every month."
2,Filter but no wick,"This replacement set of filters fits my emerson and essex console humidifier and does a great job of filtering the air. However, it does not wick up much water as the pure paper ones so it defeats the purpose of having a humidifier. Since I replaced these with the stock paper only filter/wicks, I get over twice as much water into the air in 24 hours. I would not recommend these if you want humidity in the air from the humidifier. Look for the accordion paper ones."
4,Wet Wicks,"This wicking filter is designed differently than the OEM filter in my Sears humidifier. It is not as neat and conforming as the original pleated style, but it appears to be similar in efficiency. It's too early to tell about longevity. About half the cost of [...] by the time you pay shipping and tax."
5,Humidifier Filters,These are standard filters. I have been using them for years I have not had any problems with them.
4,Good Filter..,"Good filter easy to replace and does a good job .. Just make sure you change it every year and use water treatment product to keep water fresh and the filter will do a much better job, especially if you have nasty water.."
2,One Problem for Kenmore Use,"These filters restrict air flow in my Kenmore humidifier.The result is that the motors have to work harder and they overheat - the odor of melting insulation was my first clue. I also removed the cover and placed my hand on each motor and they were definitely very hot (ruling out that I had one faulty motor). For a quick fix I 'bowed' one filter in each side, breaking the airflow seal to allow more airflow and reduce stress on the motors. This helped but, of course, breaking the airflow seal kind of defeats the purpose of drawing air THROUGH wet filters for humidification. I do like the construction of the product - maybe they work out better in other manufacturers units. For me it's back to the OEM filters."
2,Fit the humidifier fine...,"But for about the first week of use they smelled odd when the humidifier turned on. The smell is pretty well gone now when the humidifier turns on, but the first few days were awful. Will not buy again."
5,BestAir ES12 Kenmore 14911 / Emerson HDC-12 Replacement Wick Filter,These wick filters are the real deal. They work great and last all season long. I have used them for several years and am very pleased. I do add an anti-microbial agent to the water.
3,Great at what it does,"If you want to learn the actual construction methods for Celtic knotwork, this is a good place to start. Much more thorough than some, and you get theory and methods that can be applied to anything, rather than a ""here's how to draw this pattern, and by the way, it's copyrighted so you can't use anything like this in your own art"" of one or two books about Celtic design by other authors.I take a hint and make a design work on the fly, so the actual construction details are lost on me. Don't need the alphabets for the art I do. Love the pages of finished spirals."
3,I expected more,"First of all let me say that I bought these books used. The seller was great, the price was great, and the books arrived timely in great condition. As for the books, I expected more. They are filled with great examples of historical celtic art. But there is very little actual instruction. I feel like I wouldn't know where to begin other than just copying what is already there, but perhaps that's what is required for an art form like this."
5,Great Songs of the 80's,Few bands were bigger in the 80 in.That helped bring rock&roll back to center stag after the Disco sounds of the 70's
4,excellent bar.,"A bit expensive but if you need it, you need it. Couldn't find it cheaper at local stores. really made a difference in cutting trees."
3,Amazingly Funny,I like the way the subject was present in such a comedic fashion. The unfortunate reality is that many will experience being fired or laid off from at least one job in their working history. In this film some of the feeling that a person experiences are brought to light and discussed in a way that you can't help but laugh. The Mr. Bradley I say thank you!
3,Fun with human resources,"By now, all corners of the universe have been notified that actress Annabelle Gurwitch got the sack from Woody Allen, who said of her performance: ""You look retarded."" Gurwitch used her humiliation as inspiration for an off-off-Broadway event, a book and this movie.""Fired!"" is a pretty good film about bad life experiences. Mostly, Gurwitch wanders around interviewing the famous (Sarah Silverman, Tim Allen) and the unknown about what it's like being terminated and surviving. The best bit for me was when she shoots hoops with a former human resources exec, who reveals a few dirty secrets and explains why you're cooked when the words ""As you know ... "" come out.The extras are more of the same, nothing special. Audio and video are OK for a low-budget effort."
1,Mouth boogers made me stop.,"After using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse, I would awaken the next morning with some stringy, ropey goo in the bottom of my mouth and alongside the lower margins of my teeth. Was it the dreaded stains coming off my teeth?? NOPE.I contacted customer service at Listerine (Pfizer) and got a smarmy runaround. ""We are not your doctor or dentist if you want to know what it is, you need to contact them""......I contacted my dentist who advised that this was sloughing cells from the lining of my mouth, and that this was a common allergic/ sensitivity reaction to chemicals in mouth care products.He suggested that stopping using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse would be the right thing to do.One star to the product, and ZERO stars to Listerine/Pfizer for not having the guts to tell me that this was not normal and was cells sloughing off the inside of my mouth."
1,"Left my mouth feeling dirtier, even after brushing","I've used this product a few times before brushing and about 1/2 hour later feel this filmy residue all over the inside of my mouth & gums leaving my mouth feeling dirtier than if I used no mouthwash at all. I agree with the other reviews. I personally don't think I'll use it again for this reason alone! It's not worth it! The taste isn't bad, but if you use it, only use a very small amount because it does foam up a lot! I'd recommend looking into another option for whitening teeth, and I'd definitely recommend using a different mouthwash if you want fresh breath and a fresh, clean feeling in your mouth!"
2,"It works, but there are side effects","As some other users have described, there are side effect to this product. I have used this prodcut many times, each time with the same result. I too did experience the peeling inside my mouth. I was pregnant at the time, so I had my husband try it and he too had slimy sheets of something coming off the sides of his mouth. Honestly, it was weird, but it wasn't painful, like some of the other reviewers described. I'm glad to know it was not just us that had this experience and we will not be using this again. Any product that has effects like this is just not worth it. I recommed the White Trays by Aquafresh. I have used them a few times and people always say what a white, shiny smile I have."
1,BEWARE ABOUT USING THIS PRODUCT,"I have been using this product for more than 6 months now. I have noticed that in the last 3 months the skin inside my mouth is peeling, and my lips dry and cracking. I use this product as a pre-brush rinse (before brushing). This is a major problem. I called Pfizer and they said everyone has their own sensitivity with the product as with any other over-the-counter product. THEY SHOULD LABEL THIS ON THE BOTTLE! There has been several complaints about this product, I recommend that you be careful when using this product, or even better yet, DO NOT USE IT!"
3,I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE,"I've been using the pre-brush rinse for the past few weeks. I thought I was halucinating the first day but then I was certain that I noticed a difference within the first week. It honestly whitens your teeth a few shades but it doesn't give you a ""white as the driven snow"" smile. I can honestly say that I would continue to use this product - I haven't experienced any of the white filmy, take-the-skin-off-your-mouth, black tongue side effects ther other reviewers have mentioned. I've tried other products such as the whitening trays but they did permanent damage to my gums and I now have to put up with 3 overly sensitive teeth."
1,WARNING: VERY BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH,"I began using Listerine Whitening two weeks ago. I noticed my teeth are actually whiter, but I also started noticing I stange changes. I became oversensitive to regular odors, my food started to taste funny. It was so bad one night that I wretched. I was so scared of what I was experiencing that I was unable to sleep. I figured out today with the help of Amazon that LW emphasized every regular odors and more so allergies. It is allergy season in Austin, and it made going outside miserable. This morning I woke up and have a hairy tongue. I have seen that some people don't get any side effects, maybe there was not enough studies and obviously more people are sensitive than others. I am so dissapointed in Listerine that they would go ahead and put this product on the market with known the side effects. I for one will do my part to bring attention to these problems."
1,"does NOT ""safely"" whitens teeth","I've only used this product about four times. After the first time, I felt a the slightest hint of a sting in my right inner cheek. I was pretty sure that the mouthwash was causing it, but I didn't think it would be a big deal. However, the swelling got worse after each day (I used this mouthwash every night and once in the morning). Right now, my right cheek is swollen to the point that it just barely doesn't push against my teeth. Moreover, my inner lips have began peeling, although not as badly as I've read in many other reviews. The swelling is what alarmed me enough to search online for more info about this product. I am shocked that this many people have been experiencing side effects much worse than mine in less than a WEEK's usage of this product. I can't help but notice that Listerne seems to emphasize ""safely"" more for this product than any of their other products. This infuriates me."
2,Boogery Answer!,"While this rinse really does help me out with whitening, I too have a problem with the inside of my mouth peeling! I am so glad that I finally read the reviews! Let me tell you, when you wake up in the morning and you feel nasty, slimy ropes of skin all over your mouth, you get a little worried!I'd say, give this rinse a try. But, if your mouth is in the least bit sensitive, be prepaired for this very irritating side effect!"
1,Now I have a hairy tongue,Shortly after I started using this stuff regularly I noticed something growing on the back of my tongue. I went to the doctor and he said I had developed a thing called hairy tongue. It's not a cancer or even harmful but it looks and feels yuk. I have also developed a constant sour taste in my mouth. And my teeth are not whiter.I am now using normal mouthwash and trying to get everything back to normal. I am very worried that the sour taste will not go away. I don't normally bother with reviews but I would like people to know about this. I obviously do not recommend this product.
1,Skin Peel-o-rama,"A few months ago I used this and when I woke up the inside of my cheek was peeling. It scared me off the rinse (12 weeks of this? Hell no!) but yesterday I saw this under my sink and couldn't remember why I haven't been using it. I know right?! How does one forget PEELING MOUTH ACTION! So I used it again and this morning, once again, peeling skin. I thought it was that nasty film you sometimes get when you're sleeping, except part of it was still stuck to my lip. Because.it.was.SKIN! Gross.Reading the reviews on this I don't understand why they still sell it with more negatives than positives.I can't even remember what I paid, but I should have listened to my boyfriend when he said ""get the no-name, it's cheaper"" :/"
3,"It works, but do be aware that it says 3 MONTHS for MINIMAL effects.","I've used this product for about 2 months, it did somewhat whiten my teeth and I had no side effects. I stopped using it only because I did not deem it necessary to continue to buy it as I was using a trial that came free on my Listerine.Hairy tongue and all other side effects people have mentioned can be caused by regular use of mouthwashes containing oxidizing agents, such as peroxide, or astringent agents, such as witch hazel or menthol. Its an allergic reaction, don't blame the product."
1,Scared - Glad I Found Others!,"I've been using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse for a couple of months now, but didn't link my symptoms to it. After all, it's watered-down mint-flavored peroxide, right? WRONG!!! My gums have been ""peeling"" almost like a sun burn (but slimy!) for the past 6 weeks or so. It started out mild and just occuring in the morning (after using it the previous night), but has gotten really bad and now lasts all day. And even though I recently went to the dentist and got a clean bill of health, my gums feel raw all the time and the peeling slimy film never goes away. I knew it wasn't thrush because my tongue and the back of my throat aren't affected, but I had no clue as to what else it could be. After reading the other reviews here, I know what the problem is now. Thank you, to all who posted and helped me realize I don't have some exotic disease. I will no longer use this product!!!"
1,Mouth Peeling!,"Am I relieved to see that many others have had the mouth peeling! I was worried I was suffering from a horrible autoimmune disease or something.I've dumped the remainder down the drain. Listerine really should put a warning on the label, so people at least know what is going on when it happens to them."
1,LISTERINE WHITENING MOUTHWASH,I HAVE BEEN USING THE LISTERINE WHITENING FOR A COUPLE MONTHS NOW. I HAVE BEEN NOTICING FOR A WHILE THAT MY SKIN INSIDE MY CHEEKS HAS BEEN FEELING GUMMY AND PEELING. I ASKED MY DENTIST ABOUT IT AND HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. I THEN DECIDED TO TYPE LISTERINE WHITENING PROBLEMS IN THE KEY WORD ON GOOGLE AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. I THINK SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PULL THIS PRODUCT FROM THE MARKET. I AM GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE FDA ABOUT THIS. WHO KNOWS WHAT THIS PRODUCT IS DOING TO US???
1,good lord,This stuff literally made me grow hair on my tongue. It should be banned. No joke. I've always had a nice mouth and now... there's freakin black hair on my tongue. Some people say 'discoloration' - thats just the first signs of elongated taste buds - which is hairy tongue. I'm not going into the scientifics here. It has happened to many people I see around posting on other sights. Sign me up for a class action law suit.
2,Tongue Discoloration!,"Anyone who is contemplating the use of this product needs to be aware that one of its possible side affects is discoloration of the tongue. I used this product for two weeks. I noticed the discoloration one morning after rinsing with the product. It looked as though I had been eating black licorice or drinking heavy duty espresso. According to an article on the Mayo Clinic web site, ""regular use of mouthwashes containing oxidizing agents such as peroxide may cause tongue discoloration."" I've discontinued using the rinse; hopefully, the nasty color will disappear soon. It would have been nice if the Listerine folks had put a warning about this possible side affect on their labeling."
1,my mouth is peeling!,"I just started using this product, and my mouth has been drastically peeling every day that I've used it. At first I figured that perhaps I was allergic, but then I ""googled"" the situation and found Amazon reviews claiming the same experience. This must be a side effect that occurs in sensitive mouths. They really need to give a warning and let us know what to do about it. Perhaps an ""if mouth begins to peel..."" on the back of the bottle. Otherwise I am forced to stop using it and warn others. I also have seen no results, but have only been using it for a week. There is one reviewer who said ""No, it does not make your mouth peel."" Well, speak for yourself, Dude. My mouth is peeling... badly."
2,HELP!,I can't taste food on the tip of my tongue anymore! We all want white teeth but this is too much. Looks like many others agree.
2,Bleached cotton,"The product has whitened my teeth. Over time, it has also created a most annoying sensation, like having cotton fabric in my mouth. I won't replenish my supply."
1,Hairy Tongue!,"Listerine should be ashamed that they ever let this product on the market! This morning I woke up and while brushing my teeth noticed that I had large patches of brown on my tongue. Soon my tongue was covered in white hairy looking growth. Thanks to all of you on Amazon who took the time to share your stories. I am not as freaked out now. But to all of you out there thinking of using this product be forewarned, it causes horrible side effects!"
1,"My gums are sluffing off, my taste is almost gone...after 3 days!","I've used this product 4 times in the last 3 days. My gums first started to die and peel away ONE HOUR after I first used the product. I didn't know what it was, so I used it a few more times, each time thinking, ""Surely this product woudln't be on the market if it was that bad..."" This morning, sheets...SHEETS of my gums peeled off! Gross, white, slimy, dead mucous membranes all over my mouth. To make things worse, my taste is nearly gone and my allergies have been killing me!DONOTBUYTHISPRODUCT!"
1,No results--just a freaky tongue,"Like other reviewers, I'd noticed all the extra gunk in my mouth too--but had no idea why, and just supposed it was something I was eating that kept irritating my mouth. It wasn't until I noticed the nice black stain and ""hairy"" appearance at the back of my tongue that I really knew I needed to investigate further. At first, I thought it must've been something in the Chinese food I had last night!! But after reading all this, I guess I know what I need to do now...at least I'll be saving money when I don't have to buy this stuff anymore (and my teeth never really got any whiter either!)."
4,This Was a Good Movie,"This movie was good. The actors pulled off the storyline well; I liked the songs and some of the dances as well. I thought the storyline was a cute one - and it won't leave you confused or anything...I didn't think it would be as good as it was because of the rating it got - but it WAS good. The characters were loveable and believeable. The acting was good (especially Hrithik...i thought the part where his character gave his speech was great!) I still watch some parts over again...I really liked this Love Story. Give it a try, you might too."
5,Awesome item...,I love this tool so much that I bought one for my wife to use on her two motos. I use it all the time and it goes in the trunk of my sidecar whenever I travel....I give this item a huge thumbs up!
5,Good product,This ia my second Battery Doc. I gave away my first one when I sold my bike.I have not had any problem or issue with my first one which was used on a Suzuki Bandit. I am using this one on a BMW R1150RT. So far so good.
3,You get what you pay for,"We bought this for our two girls, one 6 and 4 1/2. It is not the greatest quality, but for the price it is okay. My husband said when he was putting it together he had to be careful when tightening the screws, in order to make the legs of the vanity stable they had to be very tight almost making the wood split, so be careful. But once together it looks very nice."
1,Grow Great Marijuana,"If you knew nothing about growing MMJ, then reading this book would leave you knowing nothing. Read the complete book & didn't learn a thing."
5,Interesting Reading,"This book,on growing great marijuiana, is a very informative book. But more important is that it is easy to comprehend and interesting reading. It explains things in everyday language and makes little use of technical jargon. Although there no step by step instructions, you do come away with enough of an understanding of the gardening techniques that you can visiualise what you may need to do to get you started, and after you have read it, you can refer to it as a reference book. I'm glad I purchased it."
3,Middle Marijuana Manual,"After reading Grow Great Marijuana you find it was a rehash of what you have. A flick through the book told me that but I wanted some more motivation material to add to the shelf. Buy it if you want something new. Look elsewhere if you want top of the line works. It might try to claim to be the easiest book but really it is just a recap of what was already done before minus the advanced material. As others pointed out, it costs the same price as the top of line marijuana books. You won't get garbage here (because it recaps the top shelf books) but you won't get the best value for your cash. Get it for the collection if you are into that sort of thing."
3,So-so.,"This book might be helpful for new growers and I learned a thing or two from it but over-all this is not a very good book. The author seems to think that indoor growers must choose hydro to create great buds but that just isn't true, and the end result is no information on growing in soil in this book. Also some of the information is dangerous; for example using bleach on your plants to get rid of mites? That'll kill the mites but also your plants. There are much better books out there: look for Ed Rosenthal or Jorge Cervantes. They are both very knowledgeable and respected in the community. The book it also chock-full of typographical errors which is good indication of it's over-all quality. While the book isn't a complete waste of time and money I wouldn't recommend it especially if you're a novice grower which is what it's aimed at."
2,Grow Great Marijuana,This book is ok but for the price its not worth it you can buy the Marijuana Horticulture The indoor/outdoor Medical growers Bible for 10.00 less and it has 10 times the information.
1,worst book ever,"this does not even show pictures of bugs / pestsTHEY ARE LITTLE KID DRAWINGS ......and says things like spray bleach on your plantsNEVER SPRAY ANY PLANT WITH BLEACHthe book goes on and onabout pointless things like how to dress and actwhat car to but, what light set ups there areworst book everdo not buy there are way better beginers booksget a recent up to year date one insted of this old one"
2,This has all been done before,There is nothing new in this book that hasn't been done before. Claims that reading a book in a day will make your grow better are like promising you Arnold's body if you read their book. Arnold was big because he learned how to deal with the genetics he had been dealt. If Arnold can learn about genetics then so can anyone.
5,Very thorough and full of use info,"If you are looking for a book of this type think about this one seriously as it has most everything you will need. It really is usefull in many details, and goes through allot of basic things as well. There are other books on this subject I like but for solid info, and need to know knowledge this is a must. I will know what not to spend time, and money on. So I find it is worth the cost. It confirms some things and teaches new things. It also put some of the previous ideas I had straight by explaining the facts. It is an awesome reference to just keep with you if you decide to do a medical grow thing. [ASIN:0977650502 Grow Great Marijuana: An Uncomplicated Guide to Growing the World's Finest Cannabis]]"
5,Execellent,"Looks near a one stop guide to this neophyte. Pretty pictures. This has tidbits outhers don't (yet, they do too). So, complete? I wounder if any book is complete. Darn near though! Recomended."
4,You can grow your own way!!!!,"Grow Great Marijuana teaches the reader to do just that. For anyone from occasional recreational user to ""hard corps"" stoner, this book can come in handy to show you basic tips on both the ins and outs of the marijuana plant and how to produce the best yield from it. No part of the process is left unmentioned. From planting the seeds initially, to what kind of light, soil to use to watering techniques, this book simplifies marijuana growing for a layman to grow like a legitimate farmer. A great book, easy to read and useful for better living through chemistry!"
4,Incredibly detailed guide for cannabis enthusiasts,"Though not my area of interest I do know a few friends who would appreciate this explicitly detailed guide for growing your own herb. Don't let explicit detail throw you off though - this is easy, step-by-step stuff complete with graphics, lists and everything you need to know to get started.To give an idea how detailed this gets the book gives you the low-down on what pH levels your water needs to be, the type of lighting set-up, fans, lamps, soil... even what kind of system you need to protect your garden.Discretion, of course, is the most important tool you'll need and it was nice to see the book even has a whole chapter dedicated to etiquette. Frankly, this book has everything one needs to know to attempt this. I doubt there are many others out there that can compete."
3,It has allot of info but...,"I bought this and ""Marijuana Grow Basics"" by Jorge Cervantes. I like the latter better. GGM was bland to read and only a few pictures, really hard to keep my attention. MGB has allot of pictures and all the info was in easy to read chunks."
3,Very Good Program - Very Bad Picture Quality,"We purchased the ""manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media"" version of Christabel from Amazon. We had seen the original broadcast on PBS and liked the production very much. The story is based on actual events in the life of the title character. The cast is first rate.Our problem is with the picture quality. Admittedly this was produced a long time ago, before High Definition, etc. However, this seems like a third generation copy taken off-the-air using a home VHS recorder. It is the worst picture quality that I've seen on any DVD. We have other DVDs from even earlier times that also have not been ""restored"" and they are all better than this. The sound is acceptable, if not great."
3,An uneven review of bizarre fashions.,"Some of the information is fascinating, but it is haphazardly organized and uneven. I also wasn't happy that many of the portraits appeared to be repainted (ie, not the original portraits) with 20th-century mistakes in them.Skipping around from the middle ages up to more or less the present day, the book shows all sorts of odd fashions, from corsets to plastic surgery to foot-binding. It's a thin book, long on illustrations and with text being mostly in the form of sound bites, like most of these Time-Life style books are. I got it primarily as a novelty, and that's about what it is. The authors don't cite sources, but a determined researcher could probably figure out where most of this came from. It's an interesting first look at extreme fashion through the years."
3,Undergrad Review,Pros-Good figures-Key concept headings-DetailedCons-Confusing at times-Not always easy to understand
3,still waiting for it to work like the ad said,"I can't notice any difference. I have taken this product for 2 weeks and I can't say I have noticed any difference,"
1,Not worth it!,Not impressed at all. Didn't help me one bit. Total waste of money in my opinion. Used as directed and no positive results to show for it.
4,"Does work for me, helpful but no miracle","Zalestra does seem to help me with my perimenopause/menopausal symptoms (I'm 47), I've been taking the product for at least three months. Best result has been with daily energy levels(much better, lot less fatique), and getting better rest at night. I am also taking this supplement with a thyroid supplement (Raw Thyroid) and the two supplements are helping to balance my hormone fluctuations. I've experimented with not taking the Zalestra for a week and my night sweats/insomnia did return as before. I've not seen any benefit from weight loss, I think I'm getting better appetite control from the thyroid supplement. I'm not real keen on taking two capsules 2x daily on an empty/light stomach, that took some getting used too. And one bottle supply last three weeks, so you have to buy at least two bottles to last through a month, which is getting a bit on the expensive side. However, this product is working for me so I will keep on it."
1,misleading to the MAX!,"As a long time Grand Funk fan I was excited about the prospect of some vintage concert footage. Boy, was I duped! This is a total waste of time and the producers should be sued for false advertising! 1 Grand Funk song during the opening that is all stupid psycedelic still shots and 1 poorly filmed live-in-the-studio song at the end is all the Grand Funk on this worthless video. I have a video from the Shinin' On tour that I got from Japanese TV that is awsome! Wait untill you can find this one and dont waste your money on this other ""Grand Funk-Get Down"" garbage!"
1,Total trash and a waste of money,"Save your money!The video might have been worth price, if the solitary video performance of Into The Sun had actually been synched up with the audio track.The performance timing was so bad, I'm not even sure the audio was even recorded at the same time. Get a tape of the VH-1 Behind The Music program, free, you'll be much happier."
5,I love It!,"I love this product. My hands are usually raw in the winter and feel like sand paper. Since using the paraffin treatment my hands as very soft, with no cuts on them for once. It took only four hours to initially melt the wax, and since I use it everyday there is no other maintanance except for the once a month cleaning. My husband is actually thinking of using it."
3,Quality machine,HoMedics Paraspa Deluxe Paraffin BathA quality product recommended by my doctor. Works as it should.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"This is the second book I have bought written by these authors (Kally Ellis & Ercole Moroni). The first book I bought was full of outdated, useless pictures. I thought the cover picture on this book looked attractive and decided to give these authors another shot. You can't imagine my surprise when I found out that this was the same exact book as the first one, page for page, with the only difference being the title and cover. Same outdated, outlandish, and unuseable pictures of bouquets and headpieces. I have worked on many weddings, and haven't ever had a bride use any of the ideas in this book. I don't even show it anymore. The ideas presented are laughable to most people. I can't imagine a greater waste of money then buying this book has been."
1,The Feminization of a Mans Sport,"Why do some bodybuilders somehow think they have to soften their musculature with softening their masculine features, growing long flowing hair, wearing baggy clothes, and shaving all the masculine hair from their faces and bodies.... okay, that is bad enough, but now when you start talking about how bodybuilding is some kind of ""energy""... please, Mr. Zane... build your muscles with the iron in the gym... make those plates slap together, grunt and thank God and be proud you are a man! If you want philosophy with your bodybuilding, then get a copy of ""BROTHER IRON, SISTER STEEL"" by Dave Draper... a terrific book that makes sense and allows bodybuilders to feel good about all their testosterone and makes no excuses or apologies for being a muscular male with his share of hormones."
5,Zane,"Very interesting book by Frank Zane. Plenty of workout ideas here. Some of the poetry is not very good, but the book is a great resource for body builders of all levels."
5,A personal look at the man and what drives him.,"I really enjoyed this book because it isn't your run-of-the-mill fitness book. I believe that it is just as important, if not more so to see what drives a person to do what they do at such an optimal level in life. I can look anywhere and find exercises to do. This book gave me a glimpse of the person, Frank Zane, that I haven't seen elsewhere. It's nice to know there is some spirituality and intelligence behind the body. I highly recommend this book."
1,Zane Attempt at Bodybuilding,"Frank was a legend in the 70s... lean, yet powerfully built, with good looks and a physique that wouldn't quit... but in he did it with hard, routine, monotonous work in the gym and a ""don't quit"" attitude. This is 2001, and though the tried and true methods still work just fine, there are 1000 other books that will have these same routines listed and with better explainations and illustrations. PLUS we won't have all the Zane ""philosophy"" which is all just a lot of watererd down new age blabbering. If you are a bodybuilder with a ""get tough-get big"" attitude, this mamby pamby whimpering will drive you nuts."
1,Woman Against Herself,"Amateur writing style, simplistic and very very poorly written. Terrible story line. Simply not worth the money...and it was free."
3,Robert Powell as a Harlequin with special powers.,"Released in 1980. Original Title: Harlequin.Alex (Mark Spain) is a nine-year old who is ill with Leukemia. Robert Powell (Jesus of Nazereth [1977]) plays a clown at his birthday party and tries to cheer him up. Alex's father, Nick (David Hemmings) is a Senator who could become the next Deputy Governor. The clown, also known as a Harlequin, has a gift of performing magic for children and is able to produce thunder from the sky at will. The boy has become quite taken by the clown. After paying a surprise appearance to the sick boy with clown make-up, the family soon realizes this man, ""Gregory"", has special healing powers for the boy. However he has evil powers for others."
3,plate rack,"Although the plate rack is fine, very sturdy and attractive, it is not the plate rack as pictured here, it is a less expensive model. Although I was disappointed not to get the rack I thought I ordered, the rack I received is very sturdy and worth the money."
4,A very useful reference - excellent photos!,Exhaustive and complete. Very informative for every bird-lover
2,Only adds one port...,"I believe that the product is misrepresented. It only adds one port--one of the advertised three ports is used to connect to the computer, one is used to connect to the existing FW 800 device, and then that leaves one port for new equipment."
1,If you can't handle the heat...get out of my kitchen,Melted as soon as it touched the heat. I was just making pancakes.
3,A Rich Addiction,"I have to definitely applaud the author for her effort in publishing her first novel. Her colorful descriptions of the scenery and environment, the characters and their surroundings, was outstanding. I loved the title of the book. It held the truth throughout the entire book. I feel there were too many characters introduced and too much conflict going on throughout the book. As an older reader, I didn't appreciate some of the language being used."
1,Were you ever a teen?!,I picked up this book in hopes for a true to my life story.I thought I would understand..I did notIt stinks!
4,Haunting,"While Cirque de Soleil is amazing to see on stage, there are some things that can be done on film that don't make it on stage. This is not just a performance of incredible acrobatics, but a story filled with wonder, tragedy and love. The music will haunt you for days afterward, and the feelings stirred in your heart will bring more life into your days."
4,good but not the best,"I had seen alegria on bravo about 2 years ago, but had not caught the show from the beginning, overall it was a really good performance, my only complaint was the lead singer is good, but i feel she attempted to sing in a style at times her voice was not up to the challenge for, other than that ""Kudos"" to Cirque for another brilliant and mesmerizing performance."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I have 9 DVD's by Cirque Du Soleil, and this is one of my least favorites. The Aerial High Bar (#15) and The Russian Bars (#12) were all I enjoyed, and they were fantastic. The Fire-Knife Dance (#4) was exciting, but it was too long. The rest were boring, redundant and annoying. I am glad that I found a good used copy and didn't pay full price for this. I do wish they would release on DVD the shows playing in Las Vegas, they are awesome."
3,"Enchanting, But Somewhat dark ..","Not as good as others such as Varekai, Quidam, Drallion and Saltimbanco.Seems as though it has a subtle darkness or negative feel in both the music and the show which slightly overshadows the performances. The other Cirque shows have music that for the most part seems uplifting and joyous, but in my opinion Allegria has only one or two songs that contain joyous melodic tones.This is Kind of ironic considering the title Allegria which means ""Joy""."
5,Excellent!!!!,"This was excellent! I have never seen a CdS show live, but I'm looking forward to seeing one really soon since I saw this! The camera angles are superb and the sound is excellent. The Grand Finale and the Grand Entrance is spectacular. I recommend this for everyone! I am looking forward to buying Quidam also!"
4,"Entertaining, good show","I went to Alegria when they came to Miami and I think the DVD does not transmit the magic of the performance. Although I really liked the DVD, I thought they could cut some parts and add some others. If you are a Cirque fan, definitelly you should buy it. But if not, try Drallion or La Nouba instead."
3,A moderately good performance,"What I liked about Alegria was the wonderful costuming and the beautiful voice of Franchesca Gagnon. However, as far as the other Cirque performances go, I have to rate this one as somewhat lacking.Personally, I think a bit too much time was spent with the clowns. While an important part of Cirque's charm, it takes away time from the acts. It seemed to me that there were less acts than in most Cirque performances and to me they appeared a bit less polished than what I'm used to seeing in this series.On the good side, though, there were a few outstanding acts such as the tumblers and a Hawaiian fire dancer. The strong man was especially intriguing and well presented.While entertaining, I'd still recommend Quidam and Dralion to first time Cirque watchers."
4,Amazing,"amazing espectacle, good quality image, nice to look at it from time to time but after some time the things in it wont amaze you like the first time"
5,Vive .le Cirque du Soleil!,"This is a particularly good one. Two reasons to buy: most of us live nowhere near anywhere the Cirque is liable to perform, and you can buy five of these for the price of a single ticket to a live performance and entertain dozens of people. Merci M. Laliberte', merci Cirque!"
5,Wow,"Can't wIt to see more of Cirque du Soleil...I could not take my eyes off! I want to purchase more,"
3,Average for Cirque du Soleil,I have watched several Cirque du Soleil shows and this one didn't seem to be up to their usual standards.
5,Next best thing to being there,"I've seen a few Cirque du Soleil shows live, and this is the next best thing. I wasn't sure how my children (ages 6-9)would like it, so this was the cheaper version than taking them, and they really enjoyed the show. The show was amazing, and even my mother-in-law enjoyed it."
5,A Must Read,"A revealing story of the chaos of Africa - the truly forgotten continent. But, also a wonderful example of the strength of the human spirit. TRULY A MUST READ."
5,Ambushed: A War Reporter's Life on the Line,"The first impression I had of Ian Stewart, when I met him in VietNam, was that of the prototypical ""foreign correspondent"" - right out of central casting. Since then he has gained maturity the hard way - but he has gained it. His analysis of the problems and pitfalls of West Africa are right on target - some of which I have learned first hand in my own travels. If you want a taste of West African adventure without risking your life, read this book!"
1,Not like in my childhood,The internal mechanism not good. Reassembled it several times and could not get it to work well.It's only worth is decor value.
5,Informative and fun!,"This book had me glued. I own a foundation bred stallion and did not know his dam's bloodlines. With each Legends book I read, I learn more of why my stud is the way he is! I have also learned how important research is in breeding quality animals and how they did it then and how it has effected now! An excellent series of books for anyone interested in their horses ancestry."
4,Legends: Outstanding Quarter Horse Stallions and Mares,"I have the Legends (American Quarter Horse) Series: Volumes 1 thru 8, and needed to replace two volumes and get the last two of the series for the reading material at Peterson's Ranch, Chippewa Falls, WI. I did this through Amazon.com and was very satisfied with the results!"
4,Philosophy,A good introduction to Rank's thoughts. It encouraged me to read more of his work to better understand his thinking about man in the twentieth century.
3,"good ideas, tedious excursion","It's unfortunate that Derrida has carried on the Western philosophical tradition of unnecessarily turgid, convoluted, and just plain bad writing inaugurated by the inflated Hegel and exemplified by Sartre and a host of other heady hacks. On the plus side, this is a solid collection of Derrida's most important pieces and enumerates some of his best ideas: difference, logocentrism, the trace, etc. Not for beginners, but if you're determined to read an important thinker, this may be required reading...some of it anyhow."
4,it was ok,"THOUGHTS:it was ok not wow still likeable and readable to enjoyABOUT BOOK:Lucas Tennent: Wealthy, bachelor City banker. He wants a life without complications.Emily Warner: Broke, jobless and not in the mood for men! She wants peace and quiet to work on her novel.But their paths collide when Lucas finds Emily -- his cleaner! -- using his apartment as her study! Irritable and infuriating, Lucas is no normal Prince Charming. But independent, irrepressible Emily makes a very unusual Cinderella...."
1,Serious Propoganda,"I ran across an old copy of this from back in my pathetic ATI days. Unless you march to Bill Gothard's robotic tune you will quickly realize this is a comical piece of fanatical propaganda used to keep young teenagers in line. Of course that could be exactly what your looking for. I would have thrown my copy out years ago, but it is a great ice breaker for conversations about the hilarity of the ATI sub-culture. I'm sure someday it will make a great fire starter on some random camping trip."
2,Shallow analysis,"As an astrology student, I was attracted to this book because it promised a breakthrough approach. What I found was a set of plain vanilla obvious comments. A real disapointment."
1,I haven't recieve my book yet!!!,"This is the worse service ever, I haven't receive my bood yet! I paid for it more than 30 days a go!!"
5,"When You Go, You Go For Real","Bauman has done what even Ernest Hemingway didn't: written a novel from a woman's perspective, and a soldier's at that.Ultimately this novel struck me as being about relationships and the responsibilities that accompany them, whether they be between people, societies or countries, and how many enter relationships without considering the responsibility inherent in them.For some, living up to the responsibility becomes next to impossible - while for others, life is duty and duty brings responsibility to yourself at the very least if no one else.It's a hell of a book. Everyone should read it. Then put it down and think about it.There aren't a lot of books out there I'd say that about - and even fewer writers."
5,Amazingly good sound for the low price!,"Since I am selling these speakers, I decided to open up a set and try them out. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they actually sound quite good and have a decent volume level as well. I ended up ordering more from my supplier and giving a set to each of my daughters."
4,Bolivian Diary,"The Bolivian Diary of Che Guevara is pretty fascinating, because when I thought about the Bolivian Adventure, Che being a horrible comandante and guerrilla leader always came to my mind. When I read the book I found that there were many aspects that didn't let Che prevail in Bolivia. From Mario Monje and PCB Party's betrayel, Fidel's lack of re-establishing contact with the guerrillas, lack of peasant recruiting to create a people's army, lack of conditions being right in country for an insurection, etc. Even with all these things stopping Che I was very amazed on how far he got, any other leader wouldn't have lasted 2 months. Che's tactics in his ambushes was incredible and even with lack of guerrillas he wiped out mostly all army forces that opposed him. Che was doing superb until US intervention. To understand Che's mission and how he failed is to understan Latin America today."
3,The item is misrepresented.,The item is misrepresented. I just went on kidcraft web site and there is no wool mentioned there. They do say it's acrylic yarn. So for those of you who found it refreshing to see that a natural wool yarn is used for the maine and the tail are in for a disappointment.
5,love!!!,I got this for my 3 yr old daughter for her bday. And she absolutely loves it!! When she wants to ride sometimes it takes her almost an hour to get off. She loves her horse so much! The shipping was faster then it had said so it amazed me to have it so quickly! Thank you!
4,Cute rocking horse,"Cute rocking horse, really difficult to assemble. The pre-drilled holes aren't threaded, and the allen wrench kept stripping the screws. Fortunately there are a lot of screws holding the horse together, so one or two bad screws isn't a deal-breaker. However, I really wish the manufacturer had used Phillips-head so I could have used my drill to assemble...it would have been SO much easier. If I were to do it all over again, I would have purchased my own wood-screws. Once assembled though, it looks great and held my adult weight without a creak or a groan. Very sturdy!"
3,Allen wrench---Yikes,Product was difficult assmeble due to allen wrench wrong size with shipment. Neighbor helped. Once assembled-durable.
5,A new-to-me author. A very nice surprise.,"If you like frontier stories of people who overcome hardships, you'll love Brett and Annie as they struggle against their pasts and the attraction they feel toward each other while following a herd of wild horses. Ms Morgan created great characters who tug at the heart strings--an adventure, a romance and a two hanky read. ~ Romance Reviews Today ~ Coming Soon"
3,Just O.K.,I felt that this book had more potential but it just never excited me. I liked Brett & Annie & all the others but the adventure was just a little dull to me. As in most books there's a part where the heroine needs rescued from the hero & that's usually the biggest excitement in the book but for me it was way too short & not exciting in the least. I wish I could rate this book higher but it just never took off for me.
3,good while it lasted,"This worked good, but didn't last too long :( It gets stuck alot, so you have to be watching it, so it kind of defeats the purpose. I find it a lot quicker just to use a regular vacuum."
1,Robot schmobot,Sent it back as nothing worked. The vacuum didn't work and the charger didn't work. Amazon credited my account ASAP.
5,love the dog,"not only love my dirt dog but love the way amazon delived it, loved the tracking service and had my lil dog cleaning in australia just 6 days after i bought it in america i not just satisfied i estatic"
3,You got what you paided for,"I bought this item on Aug 9, 2008. The cleaning brush stopped turning on Dec 20.iRobot customer support is quite nice, I posted my issue on its website and got a reply the day after. Instructions no use, lets see what happens next."
5,Works great,"I got this little guy on Thursday and I put it to the test. I started by charging a few hours just until the light turned green. Turned it loose in the kitchen and dinning area, did a great job ran under my the table chairs, buffet, bird cage and did a wonderful job. Then we when to the game room which is just off of the shop, did great there too. I live in the country we have dogs, cats, birds, toddlers and teenagers. So foors are hard to keep. Friday ran the little guy in the game room and was able to mop while the he swept the the kitchen. The first time after mopping I didn't have to sweep again because of the animal hair."
4,Good little workhorse but needs needs supervision,I bought 2 for use in my home - which has stone flooring throughout. They pick up dirt and dust bunnies really well. The only drawback is that they require supervision in the enven they get stuck under furniture or attempt to eat curtains. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase
4,Dirty Dog House lady,"Well, this is a fun addition to regular vacuuming. Doesn't get alot of quantity, have to empty it alot, but it does help between vacuuming in the main part of our house. The Roomba people told me this model isn't the best for pet hair, but it does have brushes (they said it did not) and it does do a pretty good job. Most importantly, it gets my kids interested in helping clean!! We purchased the remote with it and they can ""drive"" it around. It's good for under beds, too."
5,Awesome little Cleaner!,"I bought the dirt dog a month ago and I am really impressed with its ability to pick up just about everything! I thought the sweeper cleaners did a great job but after the dirt dog there's no turning back. My dog, a Cavalier King Charles, sheds but the dirt dog picks up all her hair plus mine!Love the design, function and price but hate the short battery life. It only works for 1 hour and a few minutes. So I always charge it and put it to use in one room before charging it again to clean another room. Takes time...but I still love it!"
1,Broke after 3 uses,"Product worked great while it worked. Unfortunately, it broke after three uses. It would no longer hold a charge."
4,irobot 1100,"The unit works very well, but the battery and charger does not last long. Have to replace battery and charger about once a year. They cost as much as the irobot 1100."
2,Bad dog,"This items started giving us problems after a week and a half of use. I charged it as recommended, cleaned it as recommended and it stops running after 5 minutes of use. I am ready to send it back!!!"
3,"Good for hard floors, not so much for carpet","This eager little gadget does pretty well on hardwood, vinyl, etc. Remember that it is not a vacuum, it's a sweeper, and this actually works against it when on dense carpet. If you have long-haired dogs, you'll have to remove the brushes frequently to clean out the hair. Electrical cords can be a major obstacle, so pick them up before turning this thing loose. Overall, it's worth the hundred bucks paid, but if you want serious carpet cleaning look at the higher level models (or use your vacuum cleaner)."
4,Works great in the shop and garage,I am very pleased with my Dirt Dog. It works great on saw dust in the shop and leaves and dirt in the garage. It has plenty of battery life to clean the my whole two car garage plus the shop.
5,Great for the price.,Very easy to use and to empty......this model does not have the charging dock......you don't need it.....when it is done i just stop it and plug it in...no problems.
5,Dog Shedding,"My dog sheds an enormous amount of short black hairs. I was skeptical at first, but after a few tries I was hooked. It saves hours of sweeping and does a remarkable job on my hard floors."
4,Check your box ASAP,"I ordered 2 of these for X-mas gifts and I bought early so I had them for months before I wrapped and delivered them. One of the 2 I had ordered had no charger in the box.Other than having to order a charger, I have no complaints.I bought this since my folks and in-laws both have indoor pets. This irobot dirt dog will pick up pet hair and most debris from a smooth type floor (linoleum, concrete, wood, etc...).I will buy more of these as gifts and for my home, but will open the boxes immediately to ensure everything is in the package."
5,IRobot 110 Dirt Dog Workshop Robot works great,"The IRobot sweeper works better than the IRobot vacuum on animal hair. Having 7 cats + two dogs, at this time of year there is a LOT of hair floating EVERYWHERE. The sweeper gathers it all up. Even tho it does not run as long as the vacuum it does a much better job. The larger dust bin does not have to be emptied half way thru the job. Runs over low rugs just fine. Much easier to set it to run than dragging out a heavy vacuum."
3,I love it and it's a pain,"I've had my Dirt Dog for about 6 weeks. It was out of commission twice because it gets dog hair wrapped around parts and quits working. When this works, it is great but it takes a lot of maintenance itself. My floors, low carpet, sisal rug, parquet wood, and ceramic look great and feel great under bare feet after sweeping. I love having it sweep daily for me. I live in an area with a lot of leaves and sand and have two dogs, one longish haired. My problem is the roller ball in the front and part where the sweeper brushes actually attach to Dirt Dog and rotate, get dog hair wrapped around them and quit turning (sweeping). I seem to spend a lot of time cleaning these as well as frequently cleaning the brushes. Luckily the small ball front wheel pops out and that makes it easy to clean. The square area where the brushes attach is a different matter. My husband had to unscrew the DD to clean them."
5,iRobot Dirt Dog,"I love this!! I had a Roomba, the red/white one, for about 3 yrs and wore it out. I had carpet when I first got it but have since put in laminate and tile. I was looking at the different models when the old one finally quit. I found the description of the Dirt Dog's cleaning power might work better on my laminate and tile than the other models. I could not be more happy with a product than this one. It picks up everything, the brushes are easy to clean and the container holds lots more. This will work on carpet very well also. I have longhaired cats and dogs and they shed tons of hair. I do use a dust mop to get up the worst of the hair before I use the Dirt Dog so it won't clog the brushes.Pat"
1,Dead Dirt Dog,"Purchased dirt dog from Irobot. Used only one time then it stopped working. Finally talk to Irobot and they tell me, ""you pay the shipping to send the broken dirt dog back to us (minus a few parts), and do not use original box (i.e. now buy a new box).When I pointed out that by having the customer pay for shipping and handling (approx. $20) to return a defective product that the customer (me) is paying MORE money to own a defective product. If I choose to send the roomba back for refund - as it's defective - I still have to pay the return postage (but at least I'll save the expense of buying a new box).Oh, and read their warranty - they reserve the right to replace broken roombas with remanufactured parts/pieces. So if you bought a new, defective roomba, you may just PAY more money to have Irobot send you used parts. Sweet."
4,Great Product!!,"The dirt dog is a great low cost alternative from iRobot. It follows a circular pattern so the less stuff you have on the floor the better it keeps to a set cleaning route. Where there are objects, it bounces off and re-sets itself on a new path. Transitions from hard wood to area rugs and from wall to wall to linoleum with no problem. Be careful about very thin rugs and those with long fringe.The side brush helps clean along mouldings. Picks up cat litter, bird seed, shed fur with ease. Dust collection bin sufficiently large to enable a lengthy clean without emptying.Depending upon the amount of fur and hair on the floor, you do need to clean the brushes quite regularly which is a pain. The floors had not been vacuumed in a while, though, so with regular use, the need to continually clean (several times removing fur from brushes when cleaning one room) should be reduced."
5,Love it!,"I love this robot.. It works better than a hand vac and uses less energy.. I have two of these.. If you have any problems pushing a regular vacume, this is for you.."
5,dog hair,"I have two long-haired dogs and hardwood floors. Cannot express what a joy this little machine is. Have to spend a few minutes cleaning it after each use, but my niece calls it wall-e and does most of the hard work. I love it!!! Still need to hit corners but made an old area rug look like new."
5,Bought as a backup,"I purchased the dirt dog when a part for my 500 series roomba was on back order. The thought of 6weeks without a robot was too much to handle. Compared to the 500 series this one was loud! Also it is a sweeper not a vacuum. Even though I have hardwood floors the roomba vacuum does a better job. Dirt dog also does not de-tangle itself from cords like the roomba does. All that being said it was a great tide-me over, 'till the part came in, substitute.Now if you use this as intended in the garage... FANTASTIC. This thing picks up nuts bolts, dirt, cat hair, anything on the floor. With a properly charged battery ( initial battery charge 16 hours when you first plug it into the base), this thing was running for about 45 minutes and still had power left when the garage was swept. My brother also has one. He uses it to pick up acorns on his deck. You'll find yourself cleaning more often when the robots do all the work.I also have a Scooba... Fantastic."
3,It's good but if the floor is rough the plastic gears wear out fast,"I have numerous roombas! I have used them for years, but inside the house...and love them. I have a back porch that has rough spots.This dirt dog does what it says but its plastic gears wear down really fast like within the first 3 months of continuous (daily) use. Granted my back porch is rough.I bought my first dirt dog as a trial and it work for 3 months until it wore the gears down. Now $100 for sweeping--ya its not that much. But, its a manufacturing flaw that could readily be corrected by upgrading the gear construction.You can buy gears or send it back the Roomba....so, do you want to take it apart or go to the shipping office.I did buy another dirt dog and it, too suffered from this defect."
5,so great!!!,It really one of the best inventions. My house is always clean and it gives me more time in my day to do things like log on to amazon and tell people how great the Roomba.
4,Dirt Dog,"The Dirt Dog arrived promptly and performed as advertised.It is entertaining to watch the machine get itself into areas of the shop which almost trap it, but it keeps going until if finds a way out.In several areas of my shop I have 1/2"" cushion pads to ease foot and leg strain. The Dirt Dog doesn't do well with them, so I put them up to avoid the issue.A maid would do a slightly better job, but the Dirt Dog is more entertaining and much cheaper!"
4,"Works well, easy","I love the dirt dog. I use it everyday to pick up dog hair from my english bulldog puppy. It does a very good job. It doesn't completely take the place of vacuuming, but it is a huge help (i think this is partially because our floors are REALLY dark wood). it collects at least 1/2 cup of hair a day...plus other dirt. It is very easy to use and charge. I have had it about 2 weeks and so far feel it was worth the money. I have had no problems with it bumping into things and damaging them. It has a bumper on the front, whenever it even slightly bumps something, it turns another direction. It's loud (like any vac), but i go in my room and shut the door or leave...problem solved!!"
2,What they don't tell you,I loved my Dirt Dog until I replaced my wall to wall with a low level black print carpet. The Dirt dog that would go on the wall to wall carpet refuses to go on the dark colored carpet. I contacted the manufacturer and was told that the cliff sensors will not allow the dirt dog to work on dark carpet. I told them I bought the carpet specific for my dirt dog because it worked so great. I also told them that no where in the manual or web site does it say that the dirt dog won't work on black carpet. I feel they should have been honest about their product but they don't agree. Buyer beware. I am reluctant to buy any other irobot product as who knows what else is a secret for the buyer to find out.
3,Dirt Doggie,"Dirt Dog should be named Dirt Doggie, as it acts like a pup. Needs to grow up a bit and be a little more robust. This is the third iRobot in my family. I love the 560 and Scooba and will never be without them - the best Christmas present I ever bought myself!"
2,battery,"Although the product works fine, when it works, the battery charge life while vacuuming a room is much less than advertised. Also, the battery will not hold a new charge more than 36 hours before requiring recharging and this is without any use in between charges."
1,yuck,"I contacted the vendor. Said he had no bad reviewsI must pay a 50 dollar return fee for a product thatwon't even pick up a dog hair......Used in the basementand ran it for the duration of the battery.Collected a total of 4 dead bugs and little bit ofdirt. I swept the basement and ended up with 4 huge piles of dog hair,bugs, wood pieces from our wood box, etc.,etc, etc.Big waste of money! Maybe i'll use it in the chickencoop to pick up feathers."
5,excellent,I absolutely love this vacuum. It is a great little work horse that doesn't mind vacuuming dog hair.
2,Good Vaccuum but battery died after 6 months of use.,Good Vacuum but battery died after 6 months of use. I barely got to use this before the battery only lasted for 30 minutes at a time. Expensive product and it doesn't even last long enough to enjoy.
2,"Great vacuum, poor batteries",Just be ready to spend $50 every couple years on a new battery. I used this maybe 20 times (1x per month) and the battery is dead. The vacuum itself worked great in garage. Picks up better than the house Roombas.
1,Battery is not good,The battery needs an overnight charge in order to be used for an hour. that's really low efficient and bad for the environment.
3,lousy customer service,I bought a dirt dog in May of 08. The battery clip was never installed correctly with no way to reinstall it. Called customer service and they wouldn't send me a new battery. I sent it back to Amazon and got a new one and so far it has done a pretty good job on tile wood and low pile carpet. I added a rubber bumper guard as the bumper is way to harsh on wood work. There is no vacuum filter to plug up and it does a pretty good job on two rooms or a basement and also garage.I wwould have given it a four star rating but have always had trouble with customer service with every unit I've had. If you don't have good customer service you have nothing.
4,Impressive...,"I've used it about a month - off and on.I got it to clean the dog hair from the wood floors in the kitchen/dining room/hall/bathroom.It seems to do a remarkably good job picking up stuff. My only complaint is that there are so many things on the floor (kitchen table and chairs, dining room table and chairs) that it spends a lot of time working around the edges there - and as such the battery doesn't last as long as I'd like it to."
4,Dirt Dog Cleans up!,iRobot 1100 Dirt Dog Workshop RobotI bought this based on a recommendation from a friend as a way to clean my hard wood floors. It is everything I had hoped it would be. I have not used it anywhere but inside but I expect when I get around to cleaning the garage and basement it will not let me down!
2,Intermittant Results,"This is the 2nd Roomba I've owned - this time to tackle my garage floor and my shop building. Product works ok when it runs. But, it consistently runs out of power in about 30 minutes and then requires multiple hours to recharge. After getting hung up on loose items on the floor, this Dirt Dog can get stuck in some kind of control loop where it won't restart (even when the brushes are cleared). Only solution has been to recharge it for several minutes; this must ""reset"" it. When it works, is cleans fairly well but has trouble with sandy dirt on the floor.Jury is still out for me if this thing will work out."
3,Dust Problems,"The dirt dog does poorly on fine dust. I clogged the sensors after 20 minutes. It cleaned about one third of the shop then failed. I was hoping to avoid breathing the fine dust that a contractor tracked into my shop. No such luck, did fine job with sawdust and metal pieces up to one inch. Had trouble with the the little ears knocked off from electrical sockets, jammed, thought I had picked them all up. Looked neat chubbing along throwing up a fluff of dust but it turns out that was trouble. Literature that comes with dirt dog does not list all the cloggable sensors."
1,Poorly made would not hold a charge,"Plugged it in for two days, everytime you pulled the charger the ready light went out. Only good thing was that it able to return it with no problems. Love the idea, hope they can make it actually work."
4,"My friend, Dirt Dog","I have three cats and a dog and I like a clean floor. I had considered getting a fancier vacuum to keep up with the hair, but I'm glad I didn't. I let Dirt Dog out twice a day--once in the front half and once in the back half of my house. Both the hardwood floors and the carpet look great. Dirt Dog does not like guitar stands, jumbled electric cords, shoelaces or bumpy throw rug edges. Otherwise, he just runs around and does his job."
3,Sweeps only NOT a Vacuum,"I own two of the Roomba 550s and bought two of these Dirt Dogs as Gifts. After setting one up I noticed there is no vacuum. Extremely disappointing. The Dirt Dog SWEEPS only. It doesn't work nearly as well for cleaning as the other model I have. I also noticed that it's logic is a lot simpler. The 550 I have will go around the legs of furniture and hug the walls, the Dirt Dog seems to bounce around randomly. Anyway the Dirt Dog is good for the money and for the shop, but will not keep your house as clean as you want it and keep in mind it does not Vacuum so it does nothing on carpet. Hope this review helps."
4,"Works well, but you need compressed air to clean it","It eventually won the 'battle against dirt' in my basement shop -- but it got clogged up frequently from all the dust (I have concrete floors, but they haven't been cleaned thoroughly in the 15 years I've had the house).There are six spots that have to be blown out, 4 'cliff sensors' and two 'bumper sensors' which are accessible to air through holes behind the battery ears, but are not called out in the manual.If your basement is cleaner (and I would think most are) you shouldn't have these problems. I recommend the dirt dog even though it does require more care and feeding than a roomba or a scooba (both of which I'd rate 5 stars) also, it often gets stuck when it tries to eat small (quarter sized) chunks of brick, stone or plaster."
4,love my dirt dog,"Decided to try out the dirt dog because of the great price and the horrendous amount of excess hair my dog produces in a day (not too mention the child and cat adding to the mix)! We have a 1600 sqft condo with all hardwoods and the dirt dog gets the job done. Saves me a ton of time vacuuming. I work from home so I can just move it around the house as needed. It rarely gets caught up and the compartment holds a ton of fur. Only downside is the battery life, wish it lasted longer, but not too big a deal since I'm typically home to plug it back in. Great product, great price."
1,Insufficient Battery Life,First battery failed during warranty period. Replaced by another battery with a warranty that expired at the same date as the original. The second battery failed a few months following the warranty expiration. Clever but undependable product.
5,My little Buddy,I love my Dirt Dog so much that I purchased 4 more for my girls. I am amazed at how clean the floor feels after My Buddy sweeps!!!! No more swiffers for me
4,Surprisingly effective little machine,"I was dubious when ordering the Dirt Dog Robot for my husband's shop, but we let it loose on a shop floor full of saw dust, metal filings, etc. We were surprised at how well it cleaned the floor. The tray does need to be emptied often, and it took 2 or 3 re-charges to get the job done. Also, it's noisy. Ultimately, however, we were very pleased with the product for the price."
1,a useless book for a useless pastime,"i just got this book for my birthday and i have to say not only is it a terrible book, but it's completely useless to me. i don't even have any beanie babies. i think my nana gave it to me in hopes of getting me interested in these silly toys, but honestly, it's only made me hate them even more and feel sorry for the people who consider them a valid collector's item. what can you do with these puppets aside from display them on your dash board or ""admire"" them? that's not exciting. and it's definitely not fun. i'd rather take a nap. or collect stamps. atleast stamps will be worth something in 20 years. heck, atleast stamps are worth something right now."
3,Good book -- but information is out of date,"The history in this book is great and it's full of pictures; however, many are no longer accurate. The book was published in 1975 and much of what used to be there is no longer there and/or the properties are inaccessable because they are on private lands."
3,Maps very poor - almost useless - and out of date,"The info may be dated, true, as mentioned above, but more importantly, the sketchy maps (in the back, not with each entry) have no detail and out of date or <no> road numbers/names which will make finding many of the sites impossible. Good, old B&W photos, though."
4,art supplies to go with easel,I bought this set of art supplies to go with the easel for my Granddaughter for Christmas. It was nice because everything a child would need to paint with is in this set. She's having lots of fun with it.
2,Washable ha!,Bought the whole set for our 3 year old daughter thinking because it is a kids paint set you could wash it out of her clothes if a drop or two went past her smock....not the case we had to switch to another set of paints. Such a bummer.
4,Nice set,"I really like this set.At first, i was hoping the manufacturer made the paints washable.Thank God it was or today i would b in big trouble.Love it!"
1,Would give it no stars,Bought this for my sons step 2 easel because thought it was a great value for the money and it did not say for use with Melissa and Doug easel only it ruined the easel in five minutes the black colored chalk would not come off the board my sons Christmas gift was ruined in less than five minutes I had called the company about it and they where no help thankfully step 2 is a great company and sent me a replacement board even though it was not their products fault as a result of poor management Melissa and Doug products will not be in my home the only thing worth salvaging in this set was the brushes paper and cups as for the paint that to had problems very smelly should have went with crayola
1,Paint smells of thermaldahyde!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought the Melissa & Doug Deluxe Easel Companion Set for my daughter's 3rd birthday and the Melissa & Doug Easel. I opened the paints and poured in all of the corresponding cups and she started painting and I started to smell thermaldahyde. The smell was horrible. This was the same smell of when I was in cadaver lab in college and I wore double gloves since it smelled so bad. I threw all of the paints away and the paintings into the outside garbage. I could still smell the thermaldahyde on the kitchen table where I put her painting after she was down. I washed the table with wood polish and kitchen cleaner and still smelled of thermaldahyde. I definitely would not recommend the paint from Melissa & Doug. The box says non-toxic, but it is also made in China. It did not smell non-toxic."
5,Good Stuff,"Love this set, especially the paints portion. Both my 5 year old and 20 month old have enjoyed using it. One paint brush per color with the special tops keep things simple for them!"
4,Great Accessory Set,"This would get 5 stars but the ""washable"" poster paint stains.The spill proof paint cups are excellent. We didn't use all the paint the first day and I put the lids back on, we were able to use the leftover paint a few days later."
2,"OK starter set, but will not buy this again",We bought this when we ordered the easel. It is an ok starter set as it has most of what your toddler will need to use his easel.Then marker arrived broken - the point pressed in the first time we touched it to the whiteboard and we had to throw it away.The chalk is horrible - it makes a lot of dust. We will definitely buy another brand ASAP.The paint cups seem very nice - this is the only item we will probably keep.The paintbrushes are only ok - the hairs come off after only a couple of uses. It is very nice that the brushes are color coded with the paint and the paint cups.The set only comes with one eraser - we had to get another for the whiteboard. The one it comes with works well for the chalkboard.
5,Must-Have,"I bought the easel that this product goes along with, as well. This is a great product and a must-have if you own an easel. The paint lasts for a very long time in the no-spill canisters that comes with it. Also, it is great for young children as painting builds their confidence and self-esteem. It also teaches them to express themselves more freely. I am definitely not dissapointed in this product!"
3,Easel companion set,A must buy if you purchase the easel. Should upgrade the chalks to dust free ones.
3,What a mess!,The paint is NOT washable! It has destroyed 2 outfits and a rug that got splattered! The white board won't come clean and the marker broke before we even got to use it. It's a good sturdy product but ill be buying crayola paint and new white board markers!
2,"Great stuff, but paint is NOT VERY WASHABLE!","My 3 year old loves to paint, so I got her the easel plus accessories. But seriously- you guys need to know- that M&D paint is not very washable! Go buy some Crayola Washable Fingerpaint to replace it, don't even bother with this crap! My little girl has been a messy painter for a while now, and crayola washed off, but this stuff has stained all kinds of things in my house!"
3,"Great selection, poor quality","When I got this for my daughter I thought it would be a great investment of our time and money, but I was disappointed. The paper, cups, paintbrushes, and eraser are great, but the paints, marker, and chalk have all successfully stained the heck out of every surface they have touched. Mine and my daughters hands are stained for hours after coming in contact with the paint despite scrubbing with different soaps. The paint has also done a number on my carpet courtesy of my sneaky daughter. The marker has also stained all of the dry erase surfaces it has touched, where ex pro markers leave no trace."
3,Decent Set,"My daughter got the easel and this set for a gift and we like both products, but I assumed that the paint was washable and it is not. I will buy a different brand of paint so that her clothes do not get stained. Everything else seems to work well."
3,Nice set but paint not washable,"Like the set but why isn't the pain washable? Its for children, and my daughter's clothes are all paint stained, permanently, now!"
3,Wish it came with a complete set of markers,"It came with everything that is advertised, I just wish it had more of the dry erase markers. It only came with one and considering that the easel has a dedicated white board, it should have come with more markers. A tarp would also be a good inclusion to save the floor - I had to order both these items separately."
4,"Very convenient. Paint cups very good keep paint ""fresh""","It was very convenient to have this arrive at the same time as our Melissa and Doug Easel, so we could assemble and get right to painting. The paint cups are very good- tight seal, paint stays fresh and usable for several months when the cover is snapped on tight. The paint does not wash out of clothes-it faded some, but there are still spots. The paper roll is very handy.I would buy this again for the sheer ease of having everything ready to go and all in one place."
5,Great set,"The only thing we'd add is more than one dry erase marker, othewise, this bundle is hours of fund and creativity."
5,artist,This is a great set when bought with the easel board. my grandaughter loves creating masterpieces.
5,Melissa & Doug toys rock!,"This was purchased (with the easel) for a 2 1/2 year old and he loved it! It is sturdy and designed to grow with him. The accessories are so well thought out...the paint cups and brushes in matching colors help him to keep the colors straight so he doesn't end up with mud (pretty much) with lids so they don't dry out...with center holes for keeping the paint in the cup..and a nice sturdy tray. The paper roll is easy to work, the chalkboard was easy to write on (problem from old reviews has been solved)Great job!"
5,Diane,I am new to buying children's toys. My daughter-in-law put meon to this sight. The toys are well made and durable. The companydelivered what they advertise and on time!!!!! I know I will becoming back to this sight for years to come.
3,Just okay,We purchased this companion set along with the Melissa & Doug easel for our daughter's 3rd birthday. The chalk immediately crumbled upon using it. The paint is fantastic as are the paint cups but the brushes could use a little more fullness.
1,BEWARE of Alex brand paints,"Alex paints are absolutely NOT washable. My child spilled some paint on my carpet. After the professional tried cleaning my carpet, I had to pay someone to replace the section with the quote ""washable"" paint. Alex brand paints cost me almost $200 that day. Spare yourself the potential aggravation and buy CRAYOLA."
4,Grateful for the paint,"Rather than repeating many of the comments already mentioned, I just want to write here that the paint alone is worth the cost. Despite the fact that our 5 year-old works on a large, plastic mat, he still manages to get paint on our kitchen floor (brand new). Luckily, the paint wipes off with ease with a damp cloth - no scrubbing or rubbing whatsoever. Same with the issue of getting paint on his clothes - it washes off in the laundry. We're also sometimes lazy about washing the paint containers so the paint dries up, but if you mix in a little water (I swear, even weeks later...) then the paint is like new again, so we've never really had to waste paint. We've had this set for about 12-14 months now and we haven't yet had to buy a new supply. My son uses the set moderately and I've been surprised at how long the paint has lasted.We're not into the chalk that much and we did also buy our own dry erase markers to supplement."
2,Wouldn't Buy again,"We bought this for my 3 year old to go with the Melissa and Doug easel. It comes with one dry earase marker and the point collapsed into the pen the very first time my quite gentle daughter used it. The chalk comes in pretty colors but makes such a dust storm I would not buy these again. I'd add up the cost of the paints, the spill free paint containers which are great, the paint brush and the roll of paper (which is also optional. I think clipping single sheets is easier) and compare costs. I think buying just the items you want seperately would have made more sense."
2,don't need to buy this set,"I bought this with matching Melissa and doug easel. All the things seemed nice. It's too pricy and you don't need to buy all of these. I'm not sure why other moms like this set. You can buy these things at your local store for less,"
5,Good Buy,Bought Melissa and Doug Easel Accessory set for my two year old. She loves art work. We used it at her birthday party and the non spill paint cups where the best. We had fifteen toddlers working with paint and nothing spilled. We had some paint feel on the ground due to dropping of the paint brush or dripping paint but the clean up was very little. Had some comments from other parents and they also loved the spill free paint cups and washable paint. Had a least two different parents wanting to know the brand name of the paint set that I got. The chalk was also fun for their kids.This is a great buy since it is cheaper to buy these items together then separately. Overall this set gives my toddler different types of medium to do art work with. Love Melissa and Doug toys they are durable and always good quality.
5,Easel set,"Purchased with the easel. Great set. I wish it came with a full set of colors of the markers, not just the blue. Otherwise the paint cups are great as you do not waist any. I put small amounts of each color in the cups about 3 weeks ago and they have not dried out as long as the lids stay on when not in use. The bottles should last quite a while at this rate."
5,Needed for Easel,"I bought the Melissa and Doug Easel, the Easel Companion Set. and the extra rolls of paper for my 6 year old grandson. I highly recommend buying the Companion Set. It comes with everything needed for a budding artist! He loves the paints best, although he uses the chalk too."
5,Everything needed to get started with the easel,"You can't give a child an easel without accessories so getting this was easier than buying them separately, and since this product is made specifically for the easel I purchased it just made sense. I also bought some crayola dry erase markers since this set only comes with one marker."
4,Great starter set,"It is a great starter set, as it has most of what your child will need to use the art easel. However, like any starter kit, some of the items are not necessarily the highest quality. So, if you are looking for extremely nice art brushes, paints, etc., you might want to get something else. But if you are looking for something that your child can just have fun with and be creative, this kit is perfect."
4,Good starter kit to go with Easel,We purchased this companion set to go with the Melissa and Doug Easel we bought at the same time. I like this set but my only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think there should be a separate eraser for the chalkboard and it should come with more than just a blue marker. I think it should have the 4 primary colors just like the paint that comes in the kit.Quality of the products have been good and overall I wouldnt hesitate to tell someone else to get it as well.
4,The chalk leaves much to be desired,"i bought this to go with the Melissa and Doug Easel... because I haven't used any other kind of chalk with it, I'm not sure if it's chalkboard itself or if the Melissa and Doug chalk sucks, but it really does not write well at all. The line are kind of faint and don't draw on smoothly, if that makes sense. I plan on getting some Crayola chalk to see if that works better..."
5,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Easel Companion Set,"The companion set is an absolute must if you have purchased the Easel. It comes with 4 colored cups with lids that hold the paint with coordinating paint brushes. It makes it very easy to put away. You don't have to clean out the cup and waste paint, you can just put the lid on until next time. Having a matching brush help my daughter with her colors and from mixing colors. The chalk is great too. It is in a triagle shape which is easier for little hands to hold. The dry erase marker is weak, I suggest buying a pack of them from Staples so that you have many colors not just one. My daughter is 2 1/2 and loves this toy, she uses it at least once a day."
5,great company to buy from great toys,"This product is wonderful,great quality and a great price. The company ships so quick no waiting forever which has been a problem for me. I love it..."
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this to go with the M&D easel my son received for Christmas. The paper fits it well and the cups for the paint to go in are nice beacause they help prevent dripping. The marker didn't work at all. The paint brushes are horrible- the brisles are coarse and don't paint well. I would suggest getting the M&D paper and the paint cups seperate and buying your own washable paint and your own dry erase markers/eraser.
3,not a great value,This was too pricey versus other products you can purchase.You do not need this to use the easel
4,Excellent depiction of Russian womens' lives,"Baranskaya swears this is not a feminist work, but it's hard for American women to read it and not think about feminism. The thing is, there is no thesis here, no statement of injustice or plea ofr reparation: Baranskaya's novella has a ""suck it up - this is how it is"" tone. This tone makes the work uniquely Russian and it maddens most Western readers. Must read for anyone interested in Russian daily life, comparative cultural studies and women's studies."
1,Way Too Heavy-Handed,"Walter White is a man with a true mission. Part black, he was born without any trace of this race on his skin or in his features. As an employee of the NAACP in its early years, he uses this ""ability"" to go under-cover in the South and investigate lynchings. He faces grave danger from both communities and struggles with the concept of the greater good. Along the way he is attracted to a white girl and black girl, has to rescue a racist man from drowning and barely makes it out of town when he is discovered.This was a train wreck from the start. Walter's story is try and fascinating, but the fictional rendering of events of 3 days is boring, trite, insulting, employs ridiculous stereotypes and cliches, is full of characters serving no purpose and others who are under-developed and ridden with silly philosophical mini-soliloquys of Walter - with no end message to walk away with. People should read an autobiography or historical book on the NAACP instead of this drivel."
5,Awesome Power Metal Album (A Must Have),"This was one of my top sellers back in the late 90sWhen I operated my Music Store at our Local Flea Mall.Fall From Grace (Self Titled) album just gets you in the moodTo bang your head and scream out for more.This is a must have for any Power Metal Fan.And trust me, you will not be sorry for this purchase.Keep It MetalWayne Barron"
3,I was a teenager again!,"I wanted to give this book, say, 3.8 stars, but it wouldn't let me. I considered what a 5 star book would be (a classic, maybe?) and judged from there.I really enjoyed this book. Not only was it a fresh breeze from all the more modern written material that leaves so much to be desired, but it brought me back to the past in such a good way. Faith is a full character; I could relate to so much of what she goes through while growing up in the 70s and 80s... so many little things I'd forgotten about. Sometimes I felt I was reading some of the very same things I felt and thought and experienced growing up, and other times I felt that I was reading the journal of a friend.I'm excited for the release of Gabriele's next novel, due soon!!!"
1,Boring bildungsroman...,"I usually like coming of age tales, but this one didn't do much for me. Faith DiNapoli is the second child of four and the daughter of a father who speaks heavily accented English and a mother who chain-smokes, both of whom can not get along with each other. The inside of the book flap said we were supposed to be able to follow Faith's life from eight to eighteen, but most of the time I couldn't tell what age she was supposed to be. I think this was a combination of lots of flashbacks and the fact Faith never seemed to really grow up. Lots of secondary characters were thrown in who we were supposed to care about, while little was said about her actual family. I got bored. A lot."
4,Great customer service & prompt shipping.,I loved this movie and was glad to find it on Amazon at a great price. The vendor was prompt in shipping & I would order from them again.
1,boring,This movie is boring. Everytime I try to watch this movie I get the same result: boring. I don't know what other reviewers see that gave it 5 stars; because this movie is awful. From beginning to end competely dreadful.
1,Boo,I did not like this film. The female main actor was terrible. The male actor was good. I was very disappointed after checking out the good reviews I bought it. This was not worth my money I really I want my money back.
3,Disappointing,"I think if you'd like to sell this book abroad, you should think ""international"". Where on earth will I find brownie mix? Or chocolate fudge cake mix?"
5,Wonderful holiday ideas!,"This is one of the best Christmas cookbooks I have seen, and I collect cookbooks! There are many wonderful recipes, plus great dinner menus and party suggestions!"
5,This book is wonderful!,I'm a big baking fan and I use this cookbook all the time. It has terrific dessert recipes for the holidays.
4,Awesome!,"I am a swim coach and usually do Yoga as a regular part of our training routine. I like this program because I think it will create a better challenge for the kids and increase their strength, flexibility and focus."
3,Average,"I thought this would be a great book, but it really wasn't up there in terms of being helpful. There are lots of other really good books like:1. Dave Trottier's - The Screenwriter's Bible2. Blake Synder's - Save the Cat3. Syd Field's - Foundations of Screenwriting4. Syd field's - The Screenwriter's Problem Solver5. Scott Sedita's - The Eight Characters of ComedyStick with those five and don't waste your money on the rest. I've bought them all and those five are the only ones worth buying!"
2,Not so unforgettable,"Linda did a good job here in brewing up all the bits of advice dreaded by any writer: finding the voice, writing with power and energy, beginnings, middles and ends... So at the end (if you make it so far) this book leaves you dizzy and if you're out for hands-on advice, go get yourself something else. What I find particularly annoying are the endless quotations of writers, Linda thinks are important and famous, but who infact are - well - not so important and not so famous and serve up a lot of not so great platitudes. So why 2 stars? If you don't lose your patience, you may be lucky enough to find some bits you can actually implement and need, such as her examples on subtext."
5,I have a job for the author,"Fixing the new HBO series, Luck. By the end of the first episode my wife was complaining that the characters were not engaging, particularly in comparison with Boardwalk Empire. One of the reviews says ""starts off slow and picks up."" When? The people who wrote Luck should have done more prep on the characters, and their bosses should have paid more attention. We can see that they learned the lingo of the track. So what? With the possible exception of the Nick Nolte character and the Latino trainer, the people in this series are little more than stick figures. The Irish jockette has possibilities. If you want to write for film or TV, buy this book and do the work."
3,"Can carry his own BUT, read my review...","Roger did an awesome job for being a one man operation. He did have a sax player but without the band being there, it wasn't the same. It's a good dvd. just a more mellow, casual kind of thing to listen to."
4,He has still got it.,"Great concert, Roger can still give an awesome live performance. Very enjoyable to watch on the big screen.If you liked him 20 yrs. ago, you still will."
2,He forgot to bring a band!,"While he does a pretty good solo performance, I was quite dismayed that he didn't have a full band to give some ""ooohph"" to the songs.Without the band, it was more like singing along at a pub at night during a vacation with plenty of drink to be had."
4,Being a huge Super Tramp Fan...,"... I find this to be a very good concert, though it is in an intimate setting so it is somewhat toned-down. Roger still has a great or better voice, and believe it or not it looks like he has his original hair! <smile> I'm sure I'm not going to be the only one to say that the way Roger is dressed and the lighting as he is playing the electric keyboard, well, with his long hair and pretty face, well, it looks as if he has a Jesus complex. Seriously, I can imagine those that might have smoked up a little before joining the audience, feeling a bit strange to have their Lord and Savior pounding out notes before them on stage... looking down to them... singing with a smile...Seriously, getting past that, it is a very nice concert, and it seems everyone is having a wonderful time. He really sounds great, and was quite young back in the day (in his late teens). Nothing will be as good as the originals, but this is quite close."
5,Even Better Than The Original Songs!!!,"I am a huge fan of Supertramp. Their music is fantastic and fluent. However, only Roger made all that possible. Once Hodgson left in 1983, it was no longer the Supertramp we all used to know. Davies, had some great hits, but no where near as good as Roger's hits. His voice still sounds great to this day and the performance will blow you away. This DVD has all the best hits and includes some extras as well. Definitely a must buy for a music fan."
2,ahhh,ok....but its solo...needsat least a backup band...nobass or anything...its soloman what a backup band coulddo for this
3,Quality sound & video... but no band!,"I assumed there would be a band backing up Roger, but there was only a sax player. I was disappointed as the DVD synopsis did not make this clear. The sound and video was great, as was the song selection."
1,"Plan to use as pocket watch, or buy by the dozen","I love the appearance of the watch, and all its functions work wonderfully.Unfortunately, the plastic which the band is connected to broke within a month. I didn't bang it on anything, and actually had been very careful of it. To be clear, this is not the band that broke, but a plastic piece that the band connects to, so its not a matter of replacing the band. I super-glued it together, and wore it for another week before the plastic piece on the other side of the band broke as well. I super-glued that, and got another week or two before it fell off again. Thus, if you buy this, don't plan on wearing it, or else consider it disposable, and have a new one ready for each week."
3,"Really Nice Watch, but","This was everything I was looking for in a watch minus the solar feature. I liked the looks, feel and time keeping. I like some others here, had the case just break where the pin mounts the band to the case ears after 4 days. It's resin-plastic and I put no pressure on it at that time. Even the 250.00 tough solar atomic I got has a metal/plastic case, but that one has lasted me a year plus going strong and is not nearly as attractive. The only one I have found with a majority metal case is the G Shock. I like it, but it is huge and definately not a dress watch as it can double as a pair of brass knuckles in a bind."
5,Spot-On Accurate!,"I love this watch. It really does synchronize to the US Atomic Clock in Colorado, it really does keep insanely accurate time, and now I always know EXACTLY how late I am!"
1,Seller's customer service is poor,"I ordered this for my son for Christmas, when it arrived I wrapped it.My son opened it on Christmas morning and the box had no instructions in it.After pulling the instructions off of the web, we found that the watch still did not work. I contacted the seller to return it on Jan 30th and the seller would not return it because their policy stated that they only took Christmas returns until Jan 15th. I asked the seller where would I have seen the return policy if I ordered on amazon ? They have not replied.I have a broken watch with no instructions and the seller will not return it.I will NEVER order from this company and I recommend that you do not either."
5,Versality Plus!,"What more can you say about a nylon ladle, other than that is serves its purpose to ladyling everything that's liquid and more, from soups to chowder to oatmeal and pudding. Best feature is the ease of cleaning. Doesn't require soaking or scrubbing. Every kitchen should have at least one."
4,Wow Miranda!,"No wonder this is not distributed in USA and hard to find in non-PAL version. Listed as Region 1 and 4, it did take a moment to play in my Sony, but it did play w/o having to resort to computer--had to hit NEXT to get past promo. Spanish subtitles DO turn off so you can have English and built in subtitles for native African dialogue."
1,Do not buy this!,"The description says, ""Replacement Styli"" However you get only ONE (1) stylus with this product. Is that a good value for $10 (after shipping)? No. To add insult to injury, the replacement stylus does NOT fit well at all. The original Palm stylus fits so that the end is perfectly flush to the Treo case; this one sticks out. The stylus itself is lightweight and cheap-feeling. After using this stylus the orginal will fit looser in the Treo. The only positive I can say is that it did work when I tried to scribble on paper with the hidden pen. Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack."
1,"Does not properly fit Treo, flimsy and broke within 2 months","Don't bother with this pen-based styli. It does not fit properly in the Treo 650, sticking out a bit. The pen is just inserted in the hollow tube top of the styli - no catch to hold it on, just friction. As a result, the stylus would sometimes come out with the pen still inside the Treo. The pen shook out easily, but this was a hassle.The pen is too tiny to be useful anyway. Get a regular replacement styli instead and skip this one. In the end, mine broke after just a few months. Since the stylus did not properly fit the Treo (too tall), after a while the plastic top broke off."
2,"OK, but not worth the money","I wish I'd ordered a cheaper version. This model is too tight a fit for my Verizon Treo 650. I have to leave it partially out of it's holder; otherwise, it's a struggle to pull it out to use."
4,Seraphine,"This is a true story. It is poignant, has great cinematography, and terrific acting. The story is a sad one but very interesting I would recommend this for anyone interested in art or human nature."
3,Content Generally Not Middle School Appropriate,"""Serephine"" is not what it seems at first glance. Viewing reveals a sad story about a selfish indivudual who ruins 3 lives. Artistic appeal."
3,still need new product with future expiration date,never got the replacement of this product with a future expiration date-still waiting-need to return product which has expired date on it
2,Overhyped here...,"I suppose it works more or less as sunscreen should, but I found myself having to reapply it more than other brands, and did get a little sunburned. I bought this because it seemed like the reviews said it wasn't oily or sun-screeny, but I was unimpressed. Smells strongly of the cheap greasy stuff you used as a kid, and it WAS oily and greasy, and the cheaper Neutrogena brand you can buy at any drugstore is far more dry and matte. Not worth the money, and certainly not worth what it says it's discounted from."
3,Had High Hopes for this!,"I'm a huge fan of Peter Thomas Roth products and was really excited to find out he had a moisturizer with a spf30. After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I was also glad to hear that its really light and not too heavy where it makes you break out. Naturally with all of these great reviews, I decided to order the moisturizer which was sent quickly. I wore the moisturizer for the first time during my recent trip to New Orleans and I am sad to report that I got burnt regardless of how much of this moisturizer I slathered on. The moisturizer is good if you're not planning on staying outside for a couple of hours but it would work great if you wear additional spf under your moisturizer."
4,NOT BAD,I HAVE NOT USED IT ENOUGH YET TO SEE IF IT WILL WORK WELL IN THE SUMMER SUN. IT HAS NOT CAUSED ANY BREAK DOWN OF MY SKIN SO THAT IS A GOOD THING.
3,smells,"I dont really like the smell of this, but its not supposed to compete with a guys cologne so it better work."
2,Pump doesn't work right,"I love this product and have purchased it previously from stores. The pump on this doesn't seem to be working right. Its obvious that there is plenty of product in the container, but every time I use it takes about 20 pumps to get any out and then just a little shoots out (and not normally on my finger which is right in front of it). I was happy to find this product for a much better price than Sephora, but I guess that doesn't matter if I can't get the cream out of the container."
5,Excellence!,This is a compilation of Lea Salonga's favorite songs to sing. All great renditions. I love the way she sings Two Words which is a wedding-appropriate song. She sang it to her would-be husband during their wedding ceremony. What a gift Lea is to everyone who has heard and love her music.
5,Calming & Captivating!!!,"As always!...Lea never failed her audience, listeners and fans. I have collected Lea's album for years and treasured them. I never had a chance to see her performing on stage even when I was in Manila. I lived in London for 6 years and much to my regret, I did see Miss Saigon twice but it wasn't Lea performing the role of Kim. I was in New York when Lea performed in Carnegie Hall, too bad we had to drive to Philadelphia on that day of her concert. Well, I guess my only wish is to see Lea singing & performing live on stage one day.Now that I live here in Seattle, all I can do is to listen to her albums on a daily basis. I always play this album ""Inspired"" on my way to work and home, this truly is a gem to own. I'm looking forward for more albums to come and continue to listen to her songs and be...Inspired!"
2,Only Half Inspired,"Lea still has an amazing voice but this CD does not deliver. Only half the songs are good; well actually very good. The other half are terrible. It sounds like she's singing in a bar with a little 3 piece band. The production is terrible, many times the instruments are overpowering her voice, which is pretty difficult to do. The drums on these songs are heavy and just awful. The backing orchestra is of a lower quality than she deserves. I really think Lea needs to part with her brother and find a composser and producer that can really put her talent and voice where it belongs. Lea is one of my 3 favorite singers in the world along with Sarah Brightman and Hayley Westenra. I hope her next CD delivers because this one for the most part does not."
3,"I love Lea, but this is not her best work.","She has a lovely voice, of course, yet other CDs of hers are far superior to this one. Such is life."
3,good band name,when you come to visit us I promise you that we sing with my husband surprise you're dead! it is a great song! one of the best ones ever! there's many great songs!!!
2,Not Good,Angel Dust was a classic work. This album has maybe two good songs. It seems like something is missing on all the songs though. Buy angel dust and anything after.
1,badly in need of re-mastering,The album itself is without question five stars. The one star is for the HORRIBLE sound quality.
1,If This Is The Real Thing I'll Pass,"I guess some people out there actually liked this, but not here. ""From Out Of Nowhere"" is somewhat decent, but after that the rest of this blows dead bears. I especially hate ""Epic"" which if not for this the group would never had made it. I guess because of the diversity to the song that made it popular, but it made me want to gag, and then vomit as the song doesn't make sense to me for starters, and in the key of E, and just droning on and on for over 5 minutes that it's worse than the gas chamber. After that it just got worse. 17 years has come and gone, and it still stinks."
5,Highly Addictive,"This is my first faith no more cd and now im wondering why i havnt bought it a long time ago. this is one of the best albums ive ever heard. The songs are really addictive. and i think ""the real thing"" is probably the best song. The chorus and lyrics are just so good and i just want to listen to it again and again. The only thing i find weird is the last song ""edge of the world"" Is it about hitting on young girls or what?"
4,"The Real Thing, Baby . . .","What to make of ""The Real Thing?"" Just when you think you've figured this album out BAM! they come out swinging and hit you with something else.Genre busting to a large degree, Faith No More embrace more styles of music than they exclude masterfully blending them into their own driving, unique sound which is strangely immediate and deceptively familiar.Most songs work well for the band on this disc with some genuine stand outs, chief among them the hit ""Epic"" which, in my opinion, is one of the best songs to come out of this era by any band.If you don't know this album do yourself a favor: get a copy. Though it came out at the end of 1989, ""The Real Thing"" looks forward to, and will remind you of, some of the best music the 90's had to offer."
4,"decent, but not great","this is patton's only effort that ive ever heard that hasnt sort of stuck with me, that is keep me addicted for all of eternity. This is a good contemporary cd but nothing great. Its real importance i guess was introducing mike patton to the rest of the world. this is about as mainstream in form as you will find mike patton. dont get me wrong though, it is nevertheless, a damn good cd. i would recommend all the fnms after it more and any mr. bungle over it."
5,Think you're original?,"Faith No More, Being the first album featuring their amazing Singer Mike Patton (I think this is the first Album he was in). This Album Out does introduce yourself by leaps and bounds in styles, sounds, and over all funk. Event he cover of War Pigs had me blown away. Mike Patton influencing the others as it seems with a few off the wall songs and lines like ""Look at me lady I'm just a little Baby.""simply amazing, get this album."
3,"I liked ""Epic"" when I was 11 years old. Is that a good sign?","The ""War Pigs"" cover is pretty good. It sounds pretty much like the original though. ""Epic"" is a cheesy song but you know you like it! ""Surprise! You're Dead"" makes me laugh. ""Falling to Pieces"" is pretty good. Other songs, well, they mostly just don't stand out. Listening to this album does sound like going back in time, and not in a good way. Mike Patton's vocals sound like someone poking fun at 80's metal in general - silly nasal wailing. I don't know, listen to it and decide for yourself."
4,"Revolutional as an indicator, not as music","Yeah, well this is the album that really hit the big on. Including all kinds of music from nightclub to deathgrowls, it's not their best release- How can one beat Angel Dust? - but it is very convincing indeed. Personally I disliked it first, but when really started to listen it again, I realised why it was so revolutional. Today, it sounds a little korny and little bit too musch of 80's, but it must've been a huge one that time. Still, Mike Patton sounds a little bit sheepish as it is on its way to be the best one on the planet, as you can hear on Angel Dust. Best tracks here are: The Real Thing, Surpirise! You're Dead! and , of course, the mother of all crossover-rock, Epic. Nice one, I'd say..."
2,Not up-to-date,"The book lists deliberately most of known techniques of marine geophysics, but there is a lack of modern approach. Not up-to-date."
1,"Marine Geophysics , E. J. W. Jones",The book that was listed in the website was hardcover and the one I received was softbound.
5,A Classic!,"Rotation is one in a string of German films that sought to investigate how a seemingly civilized country could be drawn into the madness of Hitler-Fascism. The film spans over 20 years, and shows how Printer Behnke slowly becomes a member of the Nazi -party, refuses to act when his Jewish neighbors are arrested by the SS, and then when he is finally betrayed by his son, a member of the Hitler Youth. It is certainly a classic, among the other films of the DDR-based DEFA studios!"
3,bad power on button,"I ordered one of this product, and used it for 4 days, then I found the power on button stop working. The design of the power on button is defective, easy to broken. The sound quality and function are great."
3,Value not great for price,"Pros: very light and small, great for active use like running, armband stays on really well, cool color (orange)Cons: Earbuds are almost completely useless. They're not ergonomic at all, so they don't fit the ear well. Even sitting with them on doesn't work well. I think they're too big and generic. I had to use my old earphones. The software took some time to figure out and there is no place in the directions that tell you what a lot of the symbols on the screen mean.I gave this 3 stars because the earbuds are an important component to the system. If you can't hear the music well, then you've lost a huge portion of the value."
2,what a wast!,"This made in China mp3 player looks very cheap from day one. Bought it in March, 2005 and used it for 2 month and it's broke. The customer service put me on hold for a long time as well. Save yourself the trouble and get something else."
3,Better than an iPod shuffle???,Is this .mp3 player better than an iPod shuffle?Pros1. compatable with windows ME (shuffle isn't)2. FM tuner and voice recording3. screenCons1. not as good lookingwhat else is there to sayBut Apple's iPod Mini is better if you got the moneyand I still HATE WINDOWS
4,terrible earbuds,The player is great and a good value--but the earbuds are AWFUL. Too big and not shaped at all for comfort. They hurt and don't stay in. I bought this to use while walking and running and have to buy another set of headphones or earbuds. I am disappointed in the ones included with this set--I have seen better ones come with cheap brands.
1,TWO died in three weeks.,"I purchased one for myself, one for my husband for Father's Day. They started out GREAT, easy to use, great sound quality, long battery life.Within two weeks, his stopped running. He thought it was the belt clip rubbing on it, but no. He tried several different batteries, that wasn't the problem.Then MINE started to die. Again, not the batteries. Whenever I turn it on, it lights up, acts like it's about to start playing something, then turns itself off.One, maybe. But both of them? I don't trust this product anymore."
4,No more cassette tapes!,"I bought the MuVo N200 for one thing: to digitally record hours of radio. It's the best-priced gadget I've found for the task. No, it doesn't have an AM tuner, but it has line-in. Now I can collect and archive various radio broadcasts without the time limits or analog conversions of cassette tapes. The memory will hold 12+ hours of 96-bit MP3 recordings, and the battery is said to last about that long, so I could record all night if I needed to."
3,It broke the day after i bought it!,"It was working great...except for the buzz when the backlight was on, until the next day when the thing wouldnt turn on. I dont know if its just me who has bad luck with creative stuff, but I had trouble with my last creative muvo too and had to send it back for repair multiple times. I ended up buying the sony nw-e75 which has less memory and fewer functions, but I know Sony is reliable. Plus, the sony has much much better sound quality, in my opinion. I guess if you're looking for a mediocre mp3 player with lots of interesting functions for a good price this one's perfect, but I for one wouldnt trust it to work for a very long time."
1,Item is worthless,"I have had my player four about 4 months as a gift. i thought it was the greatest little gadget i owned. But two weeks ago it started acting up. At first, it would shut off by itself. Then it began making this annoying noise and not playing the music. The music would probably come on (if it felt like it) if i kept shutting it on and off several times. now it does not come on at all. absolutely no power- and no it isn't the battery. the item was great while it lasted (which wasn't very long) but it was not worth it."
1,It was great while it lasted - BEWARE!,"I loved my player for the first 5 months, now it is totally useless. Started on a downhill slide about one month ago. Skipped tracks, powered down on it's own if playing MP3 (radio is fine) and now despite several battery replacements it won't turn on. This makes is difficult to download the firmware upgrade. Sure.. it is small, light, and price friendly at first but now I feel totally cheated."
1,Learned my lesson,"I won't ever buy a creative MP3 player again. I had a MuVo NX for just over a year and then it stopped working. I figured it had to something to do with the fact that it was made of two parts and I had dropped it a few times so I tried again, I bought the MuVo N200. Well after 2 months it's stopped working. I hit the power button, the LCD lights up a little but nothing else. The computer will not even recognize it when I plug it into the USB port any longer.Sound and operation was great till it just up and quit. Next time I buy an MP3 player I'm going to try to find one that is not disposable."
2,"Small, but ineffective. Size does NOT matter.","Although I love the size and plug-and-play simplicity of this player, I can't stand the way it works. A perky customer support person at Creative told me that it was not designed to support ""playlists."" What that means is that you cannot control the order in which songs are played. So, if you are making a workout mix, you can't put the fast songs first and then cool down songs. You can't listen to albums in their entirety or intended order. You can't control anything about the playback experience. So if you don't mind having Hayden and Hendrix mixed together, this is the player for you. But if you want to experience music how the artists intended to be experienced, or how you intended when you made the mix, then steer clear of this one. You will either be disappointed, or very frustrated as you change all the song names in your music library to ""a"" ""b"" ""c"" so that it will play as you want it to. Bummer."
5,Just one word: excellent,"I've purchased this item, and I must say that this is one of the best mp3 players (of its genre) i've ever tried.The controls are easy-to-use, the sound is great and, what a beautiful design! It has nothing to envy to any Mac product because of the design. Also, the recorder is a good plus (35+ hours) In one word, excellent"
1,Creative Labs does not offer customer support,"Purchased this MP3 player in April 2005. Worked great for twelve months - then I had a problem - it was stuck in FM mode, and I could not turn it off (unless I pulled out the batteries each time). Went to the Creative Labs web site for support - nothing there to help my situation - then I sent an email - and they told me that they WOULD NOT ASSIST ME, and then refered me back to the web site. They also gave me a phone number to call - but that IT WOULD COST ME [...] EVERY 30 MINUTES OF ""SUPPORT"" THAT THEY PROVIDE!!!!So now my MP3 player is no longer functional, and I need to buy a new one.If you value customer service - STAY AWAY FROM CREATIVE LAB PRODUCTS"
4,Good product,"I am very impressed with the MuVo N200. I received it as a gift for my birthday and it has functioned very well for me. My only qualm is that some of the tracks that I tried ripping from my CDs did not reproduce exactly and skipped in the middle or end of tracks. I was told that this was the software and that could be updated from the Creative website for a fee. Other than that, a very good product. The microphone and FM tuner are cool features."
2,Doomed to fail??,"I orded 2 of these: one for each daughter. One of the units failed after 3 days, the replacement failed after 6 days. I've been informed by Amazon that there exists a widespread defect issue with this product."
3,Good Information,This book provides a great deal of information about using technology when preparing lesson plans and courses for teaching adults.
3,"Looks good in the picture, but ...","... the magazine rack itself looks very cheap when assembled (very easy to assemble). There are no little plastic caps on the edges of the metal rod where they stick out and might cut your hand if you weren't careful. But it does its job of holding magazines, etc. with a bright 50s look."
3,Rope float,"The hole is very very small, will not work with boat tow ropes because the hole is so small. Quality is very good. Not sure what I will be doing with them, eneded up ordering a large pool float for my tow rope. Works great."
5,"Great deal, well made...seems to be holding up well.","Bright, well made and way cheaper than what you'll find it for in the stores. Highly recommended. I'm using this as an anchor buoy.. I can see it from far away and it's lasted a few seasons so far."
3,Not too great for New Grads,"This book does offer some good tips but I wish that it had a better section for New Grads. If you've been in the business world for a few years then this book does offer some good advice. However, if you're just out of school, you might want to consider another book."
2,"I may be a complete idiot, but...","What a disappointment! This book is really geared towards people with a wealth of experience. Every example seems to cite 12 years of X, successful projects in Y, AND you're friends with the hiring manager. (I'd assume, though, that with all that under your belt, you've probably written a cover letter or two.) If you're a new grad or don't have a background in your field, you're not going to find much help here.Another issue I had with the book - the resumes can be incredibly corny. I like puns and googled quotes as much as the next person, but I would never include them on a resume. I found a lot of the resumes lacked sophistication in exchange for a more 'personal, informal' tone.Overall, I didn't get much help from the book and would recommend passing on this one."
4,Amazon your the best.,When I first saw your web I said to myself these people cant be for realguess what you are for real. All of your products are affordable andthe quality is amazing for the price. I purchased several books mostlyabout how to write the best cover letter and resume the books were usedand in awesome condition. There is one problem your shipping and handling cost are through the roof please try to work out some deals with this issue.Best Regards.
4,Nice to get back to...,"Like many others here, I dug out this disk from my ever-increasing collection. It's been at least six years since I've last listened to it, and ten since I bought it. I had a tape of it with me on a trip to Prague in 1990, and found it great listening while driving around at night. (There I go getting nostalgic!) Anyway, this disc has not lost any of it's impact with me. I heard and met them a couple of years later at a gig near their hometown of Hershey, PA (*not* Illinois as someone else here commented). So if you're an approaching 30-something and feeling nostalgic, check it out... :)"
4,Between Manchester And Illinois,"One part The Smiths, one part New Order, one part Housemartins/The Beautiful South. . .but wait--this band hails from the American heartland. Melodic and atmospheric if a bit derivative and with a tendancy to worship at the altar of their English mentors, The Ocean Blue wears its (ostensibly subconscious) influences on its collective sleeve: they are friendly and want you to know. Even the best tracks (the fine ""Frigid Winter Days"" and the hit ""Between Something And Nothing"") really do recall those other bands (although much lighter in tone and without the lyrical depth), and yet The Ocean Blue sound so good they are easily forgiven. So listen without prejudice, heh heh."
3,Has some good songs,"I bought this when it first came out, for ""Between Something and Nothing."" There are a few other songs, like ""Drifting, Falling,"" that are pretty good. Otherwise, not a whole lot to write home about. Most of the songs just aren't very memorable and a lot of it starts sounding the same after a while. But it's pleasant in a non-fattening sort of way."
3,Got What I Expected,"I'm admittedly a huge fan of the New Wave, Post-punk, New Romantic movement of the 80's. This album pleases me in alot of the ways that many of the other classic 80's albums do: ear-pleasing melodies, reluctant, love-lorn lyrics, energetic-yet-relaxed tempo. However, this album falls short of capturing my imagination like so many of the more substantial groups of the era. OB's music sounds like a watered-down version of the music they try to emulate. The half-hearted attempts at rockabilly sound artificial, the mood songs aren't quite convincing, and the social commentary seem token at best. The vocals, while decent and fitting with the music, sound thin and only hint at the greater voices that have come before. Despite these shortcomings, it's solid 80's fare, and oddly, it's good enough that I'm not regretting the purchase."
2,Don't bother...,Save your cash and buy the equivalent at Walmart. This item didn't hold up any better!
1,If you can't handle the heat...get out of my kitchen,Melted pretty much as soon as it touched the heat.
3,Beware metal on hot days!,"I purchased this item in October 2010 for my new (used 2008) Ram. It was fairly easy to install and withstood the Utah winter well (including car washes). However, I have discovered that if you have any metal pieces such as pipe or steel remnants sitting on the bed during hot weather with the sun shining on it the metal will heat up and melt the rug down through to the plastic substrate leaving ugly melted scars like somebody hit it with a blowtorch. In fact, the first time I saw one I thought someone had thrown a lighted cigarette on my new bed liner. Just a heads up. Otherwise I am very satisfied."
4,workss fine,I would have liked it if the top connecter strap was also adjustable and I may cut and add a bit of elastic at the behind leg strap it gets tight when she lays down. She is a big dog so that happens. I had a harness that had elastic once for another pupper and it worked well there
5,"A ""must have""","The sweeper is good for what's on the surface, leaves, fresh clippings, etc. The De-thatcher does just what it is designed to do. I had 6 full loads of thatch from 1 acre of lawn. OMG this product is necessary if you want your lawn to breathe again. Probably only use it twice a year, but worth it. Easy to assemble, and the price was right !!"
1,Steer Clear,"This thing is a piece of garbage. Took one round on the front of my sweeper. Not even close to the quality of my sweeper. The tines don't pull hardly any grass out. Get the sweeper, not this poor excuse for an aerator. Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy made this a breeze to return."
2,Not what I want it to do.,It was not what I wanted. Got it to do somethig else. Might have worked fine on the right application. Tried to modify it to work and didn't work. MY bad!
1,Exploding lights,"I ordered these to put in my boy's room. When we unpackaged one set, the bulbs virtually exploded in my son's hand. I reprimanded him and asked him to hand the lights to me, and sure enough, boom, they were so fragile they could not stand up to gentle movement. In a matter of minutes we had three of the lights broken and glass everywhere.I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,Cute,"These are very cute, but what I didn't see in description is the soccer balls are glass and break fairly easy. Not sure how we will replace..."
1,"If You Like EZN, Then Skip This Dog!!!...","... I own all of their cd's and have had the pleasure of meeting them and hanging out with them for several hours. Now that we know where I stand on Enuff Z'Nuff, I have to be honest and say that this album is their worst, in fact it would be bad if anyone recorded it. The songs are weak and the instrumental arrangements are boring and difficult to listen to, in fact there is not one track here that stands out. Just an atrocity from this band who usually puts out great stuff. ..."
3,Very aesthetically pleasing,"Although it can be a bit tricky to handle, the glass cube slides in and out of a 3 panel metallic shell where you place the photos, and it doesn't come with a way to keep the glass from free falling out if it's turned upside down. Other than that though, it's a great gift idea, and makes even small 2.5x2.5 picture look amazing through the glass."
4,Just Plain Fun,"This is a mix of Elvis (Costello and Presley) meets NRBQ. I loved this disc. I can't get enough of it. Brian Harrison is a lovesick/lovetwisted musical intelligent.'Wrastlin' is Real' is a great rockin' tune. But the hit that will skyrocket this group to stardom is 'Yard Sale'. He has used a Who's Who of Nashville's best musicians to ice this tasty cake. And just in time for Christmas, too...."
5,Second Greatest Indy Score,"John Williams has written a fantastic score to a brilliant film. Tracks like ""Scherzo for Motorcycle and Orchestra"" and ""Indy's First Adventure"" are fast and heart-pumping. The End Credits track is fun too. It's a good collection of the best songs on the disc."
4,Definetly my favorite INDY album.,"I always knew this soundtrack would be satisfying. The reason I bought this album is fact that some tunes just wouldn't get out of my head. Previously I played the Indiana Jones and the Last crusade PC game about 10 years ago. Thats where the soundtrack had me hooked. So I admit I like basically the only songs on the game soundtrack.Scherzo for Motorcyle and Orchestra is the standout. And because of the computer game influence ""Escape from venice"" is my next favorite. Fellow reviewers say that a lot of material was left out. They must be right. The album is ultra short. Some songs really do put me to sleep, though. Somewhat boring songs are here and there. But that is expected from a soundtrack, since I'm not watching to movie to correlate.Among John Williams soundtracks, this one is still among my favorite. The star wars trilogy soundtrack is without a doubt my favorite though."
5,Best of the series!,"To me, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was very different than the other two, it gives a more upbeat feel and a more youthful tone. Same goes with the Soundtrack, these are some of John William's best works in my opinion. The usage of strings in it are beautiful. ""Keeping up With the Joneses"", ""Belly of the Steel Beast"", and ""Scherzo for Motorcycle and Orchestra"" are some of my favorites, just to name a few. It certainly ranks as one of my favorite CD soundtracks I own.Some of you may be wondering about some tracks that aren't in this, such as The Prot√©g√©es Coast segment, the Brunwald castle music, and the music heard while Indy and Henry were escaping the zeppelin. Well, these are some of the lost tracks of the Last Crusade CD. There was an expanded addition released in 1997, but sadly, it's currently unavailable. Hopefully with the release of the DVDs, we might have a chance to own these lost pieces of musical magic."
1,Repetitive and boring,"I was so desperate to buy this book when it first appeared. I didn't like ""Plains..."", I found it quite repetitive and without a real catching plot so I have all my hopes put in this one.What a disappointment!The dialogues between Ayla and the different zelandoni are not only repetitive but are also the same dialogues we get tired of in ""Plains..."". Ayla and Jondalar explain over and over again about why the horses don't run away in front of people, why the wolf doesn't attack people, how did they discover the ""fire stones"", etc.About the plot? Just when it starts to get interesting (the possibility for Ayla to become Zelandoni), the end! As to keep us waiting for the 6th.It's such a shame that a saga that started so amazingly with ""Clan..."" has to end this way."
5,the shields of stone,have enjoyed all of ms auel's current books and can hardly wait for the next one. have recommended this series to many
4,Not the best but still fun,"I got about 7 different experiments to do at my son 7th birthday party. The inta worms experiment was not the funnest but it was not the worst either. I also bought some inst snow which is made by the same company and that was a big hit (that may be because it was May in the middle of Florida). I suggest if you are only buying one get the insta snow, but if you are trying to get the free shipping go ahead and add it to the cart."
5,The Kids Loved It,"Had a Harry Potter party for my kid's 7th b-day and among the classes we ""taught"", we had a ""Potions"" class. Along with some traditional baking soda, citric acid, and red cabbage powder experiments, I decided to try the Insta-worms. It was a big hit, the kids really enjoyed making slimy blue worms with the ""worm goo"" and then wrapped them up in a napkin to take home. It has plenty of worm goo to make enough worms for probably 30 or 40 kids (as long as you watch them to make sure they aren't wasting it). According to the directions, you can save the liquid and the goo for another time and it's supposed to be non-toxic. If you are doing this for educational purposes, I'm sure you can explain the chemical process, we didn't need it for that purpose so I can't really assess that aspect. Shipping was right on time."
4,"Research and ""How To"" of Astral Projection, written 1929","Hereward Carrington was a noted Psychical researcher and author of many books on psychic subjects. Sylvan Muldoon was a young man who had the ability, since childhood, to leave his body and travel around to other places. This book was first published in 1929, long before the current interest in Astral Projection, and is a classic in its field. Subjects covered include different types of astral projection, the astral cable, the hypnagogic state, falling and flying dreams, dream control, cosmic energy, telekinesis, consciousness, methods of projection, and more. This book is quite complete and densely written, much of it in the first person by Mr. Muldoon. The only criticism I really have is the tendancy for Mr. Muldoon to say, in effect, ""Well, you probably won't believe me, but...."" Remember, this was written in the first part of this century, before the New Age had captured public attention."
4,Gidget and Moondoggie go on an international adventure!,"Another Gidget movie to love! Gidget takes a ""grown up"" trip to Rome, Italy with Moondoggie and their pals. Gidget's her usual perky, mischievous self, and Moondoggie belts out more great tunes. There's a breakup, a romantic rival and Gidget gets into more trouble than you can remember that will leave you laughing. Enjoy!"
3,CINDY CAROL IS NO SANDRA DEE,"THIS MOVIE WAS NOT UP TO THE GIDGET POTENTIAL. JAMES DARREN WAS STILL MOONDOGGIE "" THANK GOODNESS"". THIS MOVIE LEFT ME NOT WANTING ANYMORE ""GIDGET"" MOVIES UNLESS YOU GET SANDRA DEE BACK."
2,"expensive, tricky to use with good results","I bought 2 cans @$40 with shipping. Test print (black and white photo on Epson Exhibition Fiber) was 2 coated using instructions on can. Uneven gloss. 3 coats still uneven. 4th coat evened out the surface but added unwanted gloss. At this rate I might be able to finish 4-19x13 prints per can which would equal $5 per print. The surface of Epson Exhibition Fiber is extremely delicate, scratches while printing. The spray might protect the printed surface but does nothing to hide scratches already on the paper. I am forced to use a resin coated paper. Bottom line: Krylon Crystal Clear spray is cheaper and worked better for me with this paper. Can't recommend Hahnemule Spray for semi-gloss or glossy photo paper."
5,highly recommend,"I highly recommend this fixative and found no other competitor that matches the quality.Surely, there has to be someone else who makes an equivalent product and even the same one - but most others I've tried ghost, leave a film, uneven finishing, spotting, etc. Hahnemule spray works super well, enriches dmax and colors while protecting."
5,Danzai No Hana,I pretty much mirror everything of what S. C. Walstad said. Claymore has been and is still my favorite anime and manga. I loved the music and bought the O.S.T. (original sound track) and then I bought this CD. I still have yet to buy the Intimate Persona CD or the opening theme Raison D'Etre by Nightmare (still having trouble finding an official CD). All I can say is WOW. I loved the TV version of Danzai No Hana but the full length version is just great! And having the instrumental and English version just further fuel my Claymore addiction! I saved them on my mp3 player and included a few of the tracks on my playlist while I did a half marathon in August. Towards the end of the race a few of my favorite Claymore tunes played including a couple from this CD. Helped me get through my first half marathon!
1,Dont waste your money!,This book is a waste of time and money. The techniques illustrated are beyond the abilities of a complete novice and too obvious and simplistic for a more advanced martial artist - i would personally question some of them in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.The book spends a lot of time talking about what a great system KAPAP is and how great the writers are but does not back this up in the body of the book with any meaningful insights or techniques.DOnt bother - there are much better books out there for both novices and advanced fighters or better still find a good school / instructor.
3,Except it's not Motorola OEM,"They price this like it's MOTOROLA stuff, but it's not... and yet it's priced as if it is. They say it's built to OEM specs... wow, great. They should still make it clearer that they're poseurs..."
1,human communication,"Woodys books did not even send my book to me, not to mention he will not refund my money. I have been waiting for a month and no book. Woody's Books claims 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION but will not live up to it. I would not buy anything from them because you may not receive it."
1,Not satisfied...,The description of the book was not correct. I recieved the book 3 weeks after purchasing.
4,Great Price,"This book was an amazing buy! I bought it NEW for $20 LESS than a Used copy! I needed the book for college, so I had to get it. But i'm glad I didn't have to spend too much on it. Amazing Buy!"
3,Human Communications revie,Good product that was shipped to me in a very timely fashion. Had alot of highlights and wriiting in the book but a good get for the dollar value
1,"not happy, wouldn't recommend","The item was in good condition. However it was a text book and I did not receive the item until my 3rd week of school (yes I ordered it when school started)so I ended up having to buy the book through other means. Not only that but I emailed to request that the order be canceled before it was ever even shipped off and included an explanation of me having to purchase the book already. Not only did I not have my order canceled but I did not even get a return email telling me if they would or would not cancel the order. I emailed twice, so I know the email was received. I would only recommend this seller if you are buying eggs and expect them to be chickens by the time you get them."
3,Bit of a pain to get to seal,"The part where the flex hose seals in the coupler is a bit of a pain, when i first installed and brought my truck up to operating temp, the hose blew off, so i re-grouped, removed the pretty chrome end covers and bought thicker clamps, doubled up the clamps on the flex hose side and so far it has been okay"
3,ehhh,this one is so not as cute as barnyard was. the graphics as far as the movie was made is not the same.
5,Great Music and Great CD!,"I enjoy Christmas music from Percy Faith and this CD contains some of the great, traditional Christmas music he performed with his orchestra. I listen to it often with my family and I definitely recommend it for anybody who enjoys Christmas music. It also is a nice CD for family gatherings, parties, etc."
4,Suited to my needs,"Looks a lot sturdier than it feels. I got this to organize jewelry making supplies. It looks adequate for this, but too flimsy for ""tools"" as dividers shift easily and the lightweight sides bend easily. Came with a big crease in the side, which did not surprise me--tapped back out easily."
1,Tool Case,Dividers do not stay in place and what ever you put in it will shift around. I returned the case.
5,Step a side... here comes Dobson!!!,"It's wonderful when an impressive fusion album like this one becomes available for all to experience. The Mind Electric is truly a masterpiece of Classical, Jazz, Blues and Rock, with a little eastern influence for the true music afficianado. The personel is so impressive, (Shankar, Tony Smith, Kenwood Dennard among many others) anyone familiar with the fantastic fusion movement of the seventees, should check out this album. Dobson's playing is as intense as you'll ever hear, the technique of Mclaughlin and the fire of Hendrix. It's not a wonder Down Beat magazine raved about this album, this heavy fusion album is definitly electric."
5,Attention all parents!,"As a parent and teacher, I strongly recommend this book. It is a wonderful resource. It is very parent-friendly with concrete advice and suggestions."
2,Don't buy this for black and white use only!,I purchased this product to use strictly to send and receive black and white faxes for a 5 person office. It worked great until the color cartridges dried up. After 6 months I had to purchase a set of color ink cartridges just to print out the black and white faxes. A call to Brother's customer service revealed that there is no way around this problem. To spend $45 every 6 months on wasted consumables makes no sense to me! The machine has been fast and trouble free and does produce clear faxes and copies. We have not used the phone feature.
3,Won't change distinctive rings.,"Overall, I'm pleased with this fax machine. Unfortunately, there is one issue which poses a problem. As I set up a new home office, I made some changes to our phone service which affected the distinctive ring that cues the fax machine. This machine can record only one ring pattern, only one time. It simply won't recognize any other patterns. If you have a dedicated line and don't expect to make any changes, this machine is great."
1,PLEASE do NOT buy this printer!,"Read all the negative reviews carefully before considering this product. Others have written much more thoroughly and thoughtfully that I can about the ink cartridge issues with this printer. It is a clear and conscious rip off by Brother to get you to invest a great deal of money in ink cartridges over a very short period of time. The ink dries up while sitting in the machine and even though the little windows in the cartridges show lots of ink left the machine stops functioning until you replace the cartridges with NEW ones. I have received no response from customer support at Brother. This gets expensive and tiresome. I have convinced my boss to invest in a Canon fax/printer. I have two at home, the Canon Pixima line is very useful and does not experience the ink cartridge issues of this piece of bad engineering. Learn from my mistake - read the reviews first and buy something else!"
1,"Avoid due to costly, hidden design.","As mentioned by a previous reviewer, this unit requires that you maintain COLOR ink levels even if you never need them and prefer to use BLACK ink instead. I never used the color due to the poor quality. Over time, the unused color ink dries out and the machine forces you to buy and install new color ink in order to continue with operations. A very poor and costly feature. Get another fax. This one is junk."
2,don't buy this. it has a flaw,"The fax is very nice and easy to use BUT IT WILL STOP WORKING! It will say it needs new ink, but the ink is still full. After replacing ALL of ink (even the ones that's not used up), it will start working again, but same problem happened a several month later. Brother won't provide support because it happened after 1 year of use.Very frustrating."
1,Wish I had researched before buying.,"I needed a fax machine for light home use only. I bought this fax machine from an electronics store because the price was right, and it looked like a good product. The setup was easy, and it worked well initially. Even though I never used the color print feature, all of the colored ink cartridges soon had to be replaced. There is no way to print in black only. Shortly thereafter, the black ink had to be replaced. Now, it will not print at all, even though the cartridges have all been replaced correctly, and the ink levels, according to the display on the fax machine, are not empty. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the ink and gone through all of the troubleshooting steps on Brother's website, but it still won't print. Received faxes all print as blank sheets, as do fax confirmations. I saw on Brothers' website that this model is no longer in production."
3,A horror of a transaction,"The product was a replacement for the same model that I had, which, after many years, died.The transaction, however, was the worst I ever experience.The communication suckedThe shipping was 18 daysA piece was missing from the itemI won't be buying from Amazon again ecept for media- Back to eBay"
4,a must have reference,"While nearly all SPSS versions now have pull-down windows, there are many times where you don't want to use the defaults and want to modify the pull-down options. This book includes syntax for all commands in SPSS Base for use on statistical procedures. There is an introduction that explains some of the common commands and then a comprehensive user's manual for the language alphabetized by main commands. There is also a subject index and a keyword index that is very helpful. While the examples in the book leave something to be desired, the book takes some of the fear out of creating syntax for novices. It is a much needed companion for students and experts alike. This book can be used with most SPSS versions."
2,Very dry political history,".This book is not, as the title claims, ""a history"" of Argentina in the 20th century. Rather, it is a litany of presidents of Argentina during that time period. It details how they got the office and how they failed.There is nothing, as another review has noted, of the people. None of their stories. How did the dirty war feel? What was living with hyperinflation like? Defending Argentina on Goose Green--how did that solider respond?There is nothing about culture, art, music, food, literature. I suspect Argentina--and her history--are much larger than her presidents.Frederick Lewis Allen used to write (US) history, combining both the presidents and the people. It would be great to find a book about Argentina in that style. This is not that book."
3,mail mix up,"At first I got the wrong book sent to me. I then had to ship the book back and wait more time to receive the book I actually ordered. My book was in excellent condition. I am happy with how the seller handled the situation, but unhappy for the set back."
3,"Good book, a little more info than needed for 6y/o","My son is 6y/o and loves to read. I bought this book to read to him for our literature during homeschool. It's definitely not written for children (as it says). There are many words that are way over his head, i have to spend too much time explaining certain verbage rather than getting the meaning across. It has great information in it and does break Exodus down in a way that you get great meaning... but not for small children."
2,too much hilary!!,"ok so if i wanted to listen to hilary duff songs i would buy her album. like none of her songs were even in the movie, and it seems like they left all of the good songs that were in the movie off of the soundtrack. if anyone knows the name of the song that plays during the scene with hilary and her friend outside of the high school building please tell me. thanks"
5,* luvin it *,"this is the bestest movie & soundtrack i have EVER seen/listened to!! i m totally in love with the music in it. and chad michael murray rocks my socks!!! but anyway the movie is great you absolutely have to see it, and listen 2 the soundtrack if you can!! :) peace out :)"
3,"Good album, bad decisions","The best part about this album is that it has a nice mix of music, and is not quite a forgettable as the movie was. It's also not the saccharine, teeny album that it could have descended into. However, it looks like a Hilary Duff album. While not surprising, given that it makes sense as a whole PR package, I AM surprised that it excludes at least one great song in the movie- Hear You Me by Jimmy Eat World.The biggest problem I have with it is Edwin McCain's song. I love this song, but the version in the album is slightly different from the one that appears in the movie. There is one line: ""I'll be love's suicide"" that has been changed to ""I'll be with the trappings of love"". I'm not sure if this is a regional decision (i.e., produced for the Singapore/Asian region), or due to oversensitive political correctness in a teen-targeted album, but I'm quite annoyed with it."
4,great new hilary duff songs!,"I really like this cd. It is all basically pop, but there are great new hilary duff songs that won't be released on her new album, such as girl can rock (#4), now you know (#5), and crash world(#7). Also, there is a song sung by both hilary and her sister, haylie, called our lips are sealed, which is my favorite. There is one song by haylie duff, which i think is not as good as any of hilary's songs. Beides the duff sisters and their songs, there is one song on this cd that i love, by a new singer jesse mccartney, called the best day of my life. There are songs by the goo goo dolls and mya that aren't my favorite and i don't think go along with the theme of the movie as well as the others do, but, overall, i would definately recommend buying this cd!"
2,it's good but.....,most of the songs on here are really good but to me there's mainly only hilary duff songs that i didn't even hear in the movie but they left a song out that was a BIG part of the movie out!!!! what the heck!!! this made me mad and very disappionted. becuase if this the cd does not appeal to me.
3,Song that attracted me to Soundtrack wasn't included!,"I was interested in this soundtrack because of the song during the football game, ""Hear You Me."" If you like this song go for ""Jimmy Eat World."" Without knowing it I already had this song on that CD- I knew it sounded familiar.I am not really a Hilary Duff fan (especially since she got those scary teeth!), so the other songs don't interest me. ""Our Lips are Sealed"" is pretty good though, but I am not going to get a CD just for one song."
4,"Good, but...","This C.D. was very good, the only thing that I didn't like was that my favorite song out of the whole movie (the football scene song--Hear You Me by Jimmy Eat World) wasn't on the soundtrack...and that's the whole reason I bought the C.D.! Needless to say, I was disappointed when I found out it wasn't on the soundtrack, so I had to do some research and figure out which song it was. Just so you know."
3,good but.................,ok so i really like the cd but hello it was totally missing a key song that was like totally a major part of the movie what song is that you ask it is Hear You Me - By Jimmy Eat World the song is played when Austin/Chad runs off the football field to go to Sam/Hilary the Cd totally needed that song but they forgot it i guess but other than that it is a pretty good soundtrack
3,What song's playing in the rain?,"What song is playing in the last scene of the movie, with the rain? It's when Chad Michael Murray quits the football game and runs up to where Hillary Duff is."
3,pretty good,was a little more poppy than i expected but it wasn't that bad. i was a bit disappointed that hear you me by jimmy eat world wasn't on it considering it is played at the peak of the movie and really the only one people remember
4,pretty good,"well, I don't really listen to this type of music, or I am not much into hillary duff, but I guess this a pretty good pop album. Brandon, the song is called ""hear you me"" by jimmy eat world."
4,"""A Cinderella Story"" - Movie Soundtrack","This CD features some of todays hottest singers ... Hilary Duff, Jesse McCartney, Josh Kelly, MXPX and The Goo Goo Dolls .. Just to name a few!From the great pop/rock tunes of ""Crash World"" and ""Girl Can Rock"" (by teen queen Hilary Duff) to the slower, heart-felt songs ""To Make You Feel My Love (Josh Kelly) and ""Beautiful Soul"" (Jesse McCartney) you'll want to listen to this CD non-stop!Rockers will love ""First Day Of The Rest of My Life"" by MXPX - it's a awesome rock song, which you'll always have on repeat!A Personal favourite on this album is ""Best Day Of My Life"" - it's a cute pop song sung by the very talented Jesse McCartneyThere are many different styles of music on this soundtrack ... which makes it an awesome CD for anyone who likes music!This CD easily deserves 4/5 stars!"
4,A Cinderella Story,This soundtrack is awesome! It has a bundle of great songs sung by various wonderful artists. It is totally worth buying. It has uplifting songs that anyone will like. It was a great buy for me. I absolutely loved it!!!
2,A disappointment,"I loved the music from the movie but the soundtrack is not up to par. Several of the key songs from the movie are not on the soundtrack and some were added that shouldnt have been. I think Jesse McCartney's Beautiful Soul shouldnt have been added to the soundtrack. Its not only a terrible song but it wasnt in the movie. They went a little overboard with the Hilary Duff songs. yes, she is in the movie but that doesnt mean the soundtrack has to be about her. I was truly disappointed."
2,Where are Busted???,"The Cd is vey stylish and all, wiht Jesse McCartney & what not, but whatever happened to Busted??I seem to recall Busted, the best band ever, playing their 2nd album ""A Present For Everyone"" track, ""Falling For You"" in the film when Sam is trying on Halloween costumes! Why isnt this soing on the CD????"
4,a cinderella story cd review,hilary and haylie duff- our lips are sealed... this was a great song.. you will definitely like it!hilary duff- anywhere but here... an ok song now that it is old..jesse mccartney- the best day of my life... he is a really good singer.. but an ok songhilary duff- girl can rock... omg the best song ever! you'll love it!hilary duff- now you know... I LOVE THIS!! so deep and cute..haylie duff- one in this world... she is trying to be a hilary.. annoyinghilary duff- crashworld... great song so awesome!josh kelley- to make you feel my love... the weirdest song i have ever heard.. dont listen to itgoo goo dolls- sympathy.. beautiful song..very very goodkaitlyn- friend... never heard of this person but its okjesse mccartney- beautiful soul... awesome singer.. pretty good songedwin mccoin- i'll be... the song .. its weirdmya- fallen... i like it.. pretty goodmxpx- the first day of the rest of our lives... its ok.. the copied simple plan
3,Okay CD,"This isnt a very impressive collection of songs, its just OK. The CD is comprised pretty much of a bunch of mediocre songs. Hillary Duff or her sister are not who i would call the best singers in the world or even close but the song our lips are sealed is actually pretty good, and Crash World, the chorus is good, but it just solidifies the fact that Hillary Duff cant sing, Best day of my life is a good attempt by Jesse Mcartney, Ill be is the best sound on the soundtrack."
2,Awful,"Um, did anyone like this soundtrack? It's awful. Really awful. Actually, that's a lie. It's pretty awful. Because (for some reason) MxPx and the Goo Goo Dolls are on here. They're good bands. But please, your passing by Nine Inch Nails, MxPx, Anna Nalick, and Natasha Bedingfield albums...for...OH BOY, HILARY DUFF AND MYA! Puh-lese. They don't write their music. MxPx and the Goo Goo Dolls are REAL bands. And so is Nine Inch Nails and Chevelle. And if you're into pop, try Natasha Bedingfield, Tori Amos, or Anna Nalick. THEY write, THEY produce, THEIR music IS good.So, instead of buying 2 decent songs, buy the NIN album, or the Natasha album. It's more worthy, and it's GOOD!As for Hilary, she can go count her last few seconds."
1,No,"Ok this soundtrack is very boring and that is clearly reflected upon thew amount of Hilary Duff songs which have been shoved on here, which by the way are not new at all everyone is available on her CD Singles. Take my advice and get The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement soundtrack. It actually has good music.Oh and Jesse McCartney a good singer?! Puh-lease!!"
3,the name to the song that hilary is dancing to with Chad,The name of the Song that they are dancing to outside is called I'll Be by Edwin Mccain.
4,O.k Soundtrack,"I LOVE Hilary Duff, but the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the songs I did not like were not sang by her. The C.D. would have been alot better if she was the only one singing. In my opinion, you should check out the movie, if you have not already, then listen to the soundtrack. Oh, and by the way, GO HILARY DUFF!!! YOU ROCK!!!"
1,the worst songs ever,hilary & haylie duff can't sing!!! they have the terrible voice ever. why do people still want them to sing?
2,"Not Bad, but it is missing at least 3 songs!","I took my niece and nephew to see this film, and was actually surprised that I enjoyed it. I even thought the soundtrack seemed good during the film, therer was lots of diversity. I ordered the cd, and was dissappointed that 3 of the 4 songs I was buying it for were not included.1 Busted - Falling for you. Great fun song, why it isn't here is a mystery.2. The football song by Jimmy Eat World3. The song that is playing when Hilary is standing at the top of the steps, in the Wedding dress. It MAY be on the cd by Jesse McCartney, but it is SO different from the film version. Anyone know who the songwriter of the song is? I think it was listed in the film credits as performed and written by the same person. Any Help?My last, and more minor problem is that I would have liked the different Version of ""I'll Be"", considering I already have this one on numerous other cds."
3,to snow white krissy,"i think the song you are talking about is hear you me by jimmy eat world, i saw the movie last night but im not sure if thats the song played at the end although i do know its in the movie and apparently not on the soundtrack"
1,Utter Rubbish,"Hilary Duff should be served with a court order instructing her to stay at least 100 yards away from microphones, recording studios, and sound-producing objects of all kinds on penalty of dealth. Enough said."
3,Depends...,"This CD is cool, but they overdo the Hilary Duff thing a little too much. Oh yeah, whoever said Jesse McCartney can't sing, are you deaf? He's a lot better than Hilary Duff and her sister. His two songs are probably the best on the CD, and Fallen is an awesome song too. If you like Hilary Duff, you should get this, because most songs are her and her sister. A lot of these songs will be on her new CD too. If you think she's OK, you should get it just to give it a try. You might like some of her songs. And if you can't stand her, I wouldn't get it (unless you're a die hard Jesse fan...coughcough~me~coughcough)."
5,the best ever,"it is a very nice and fun cd!1.our lips are sealed- very good i rate it 4 stars! the duet was nice!2.anywhere but here- about 3 and a half stars. cool!3.best day of my life-he is so cool. his voice is just fantastic! 4 stars!4.girl can rock!-very,very upbeat song. it is the best! 5 stars!5.now you know-first its kind of slow then it gets fast.... 5 stars!6. one in this world-very good 5 stars!7.crash world-upbeat! the best!5 stars8. to make you feel love-not my type. maybe you like it. 3stars.9.sympathy-nice. cool. 3 stars10.friend- somethig between soulful and pop. very good 4stars11.beautiful soul-perfect!5stars!12.i'll be-i love it! of course,5stars13.fallen-mya is in her best in this song. it is so good!5 stars14.first day of the rest of your life-good. love it! 4 stars!everything is just good. this you have to buy okay!"
2,An Unnecessary Book,"Originally, the manuscript mustn't have found a U.S./U.K. publisher, as is made obvious by the fact that it first appeared in German translation. Consequently, it wormed its way back stateside and Algonquin Books took mercy on it. The book is a cut-and-paste, Readers-Digest-Condensed-Books version of the solid biographies available for each and every woman treated here. The author has not added a shred of original research or insight. Bessie Smith's connection with Harlem was tenuous. She played, and recorded in, New York a few times, but never lived there. A much better choice would have been Mamie Smith - but that would have required research, see? The Queen of Greenwich Village, for instance, was a woman known as Romany Marie. Again, the author would have had to do her homework. And neither Bessie Smith nor Ethel Waters are anything to do with Bohemia. Thus, the reader is tricked by both the book's title and subtitle, as well as by a lazy author."
5,Motherwit,"The book arrived in excellent condition. This is more a review of the seller than of the book, but I recommend both."
2,"Nice unit, but mine broke after less than a year","I really liked this unit when I purchased it. Especially with all of the different formats that it will read. However, in the last month or so, the unit has begun to freeze at random points on almost any DVD I use. The only way to ""un-freeze"" it is to literally unplug the unit. This usually occurs 30 minutes to an hour into the DVD. I originally though it may have to do with the heat generated by the unit and the rest of the A/V equipment, but even after I moved it out of the cabinet and into a well ventilated area, it still freezes. The unit did not seem warm to the touch either. I used to be a diehard JVC fan, but after this issue and issues I had with my JVC A/V receiver, I have switched to Onkyo and Sony. Good luck!"
2,Didn't find it up to standards...,"I'm returning mine because of two reasons:1. There is a very slight pause when playing movies. It's only about 1/2 to 1 second, but it's annoying.2. (this is why I'm returning it) after I used the 60x fast forward, then hit play, it played just faster than normal. It worked ok when I turned the unit off then on again. Problem is that I shouldn't have to do this.Yes, these are minor things, but these are the things I wish I would have known before I dropped 2 bills for it."
2,unreadable lyrics to unlistenable songs,"This mess gets the award for worst album packaging ever. The booklet is fat, blurry, green letters on a green, white and yellow background that are IMPOSSIBLE to read. You cannot even read the titles to the songs on the back of the CD, so print out the Amazon track list if you make the mistake of buyng this crappy CD. What does it say about the content of the lyrics if the band does not want you to read them. The songs themselves, nothing special here, just your Gun N Roses era late hair band trying to be a punk band, and sounding undistinctive, unmemorable, and easily ignorable. Stick with the Dead Century album, and skip this garbage."
5,VENOM-SPEWING ATTITUDE R&R PUTS OTHER BANDS TO SHAME,"The fifth album from the most underrated bandin the last 20 years is a full-on assault of pureattitude rock'n'roll. Lead singer Kory Clarke lives and breathes whatever he sings and drivesit home with pure conviction. Very sadly, thiswas the swan song for this band, but the band was so ahead of it's time they will probably be regarded as Gods in fifteen years. This albumis different from earlier releases, as theygravitated away from the straight-ahead, creativemetal, and moved towards angrier, screw-you attitude-type music. The earlier releases, though are excellent, andthe good news is that everyone should keep theireyes out for Kory Clarke's new band, SpaceAge Playboys, which carries on the tradition of this type of music."
4,Boy Did You Ever Miss Out!,"Warrior Soul's angst & ferocity are where many bands of 2005/06 wish they could get to...After a couple of overall weaker albums the band redeems themself with Space Age Playboys. Although a much different album musically. It is still powerful & exciting but the band went for a glam meets early punk mix of musical styles. Kory Clark still one of the best screamers of all-time & he doesn't disappoint at all here. As an album goes this is the kind of record that you put on and play all the way to its end. ""Rocket Engines"", ""The Drug"", ""The Image"" & onward this is a powerful assault & one that should not be missed. The production quality is equal to the debut & I think the songs are nearly as good. The closer ""Fighten' The War"" is a big bombastic track & for it alone a worthy purchase."
1,Sterling silver heart clasp bracelet,"Bracelet is very nice, arrived on a very timely basis, will do business with this vendor again."
3,Where's the feeling?,"The guitar playing is decent, but it seems like he doesn't play from the gut like his previous incarnations."
5,the best vinnie moore out there,"out of nowhere is vinnie best and mostcrankin guitar cd I have ever heard sinceminds eye,this cd rocks better than anythingnow days,if you are a vinnie moore fan and youhave not heard this,your missing alot.go out andbuy this one."
3,okay for price,This unit is very compact and light and while it was in my ear it was comfortable. The problem I experienced was that it would not stay in (my) ear. I believe that it will work fine with an added ear loop. My opinion is that it should come with one in case you need it.
3,my experience with my ear bud,The Samsung WEP 200 - Headset ( ear-bud ) - wireless - Bluetooth is very clear and is very small. I like it. The down fall is that you must have a direct line of sight with your cell or else you start to get static immediately. distance with direct line of sight is good. One more down fall is that it does not have noise reduction so it picks up all of the noise around you really good. I had the Motorola H700 and that was good on the noise reduction. If you like getting attention for your gadgets this one gets plenty becasue of its size. something I can live without.
1,Fake!,"Anyone can tell this is a fake product. I've owned several genuine headset and I can tell by the package, the look and the quality of the sound."
5,Wonderful Size and Sound!!,"This is one of the best ""little"" bluetooths on the market today! We've bought a few of these now also as gifts, as we found that the quality and function is fantastic for this price range..and we all know that Amazon sells it all for way less than anywhere else!"
2,samsung wep 200,So bought this samsung wep 200 and it said it was new. When I got it I could tell it wasn't knew since it had a few scratches on the charging dock.
2,close but no cigar,"The sound quality is great. When I first got it I thought this is it, no need for any expensive bluetooth headsets. However this feeling died fast as the head set never stayed on my ear. It would never take more then 15 minutes before I was putting it back in my ear. If it had a hook to rap around my ear with the earbud piece to help it fit snug it would be a 5 star rating. However since it is now currently lost in my car, after the last time it fell off my ear, I can give it no more then two stars."
5,"Fuller 4-jaw, 12 point rachet brace","This tool is well designed and solidly built. Prior to ordering, I was a little concerned about the plastic parts. However, when I actually saw the tool, it was obvious that the type of plastic used was far more durable than wood. I had to replace my former long-used brace because the wood handle split when stored for a period of time in a hot, rental storage building. I foresee this brace lasting for a long, long time."
4,Pretty good.,Seems to be made well. I'm a little nervous about the plastic parts but so far they have held up. I haven't given it a beating as I have this in a survival kit and don't use it regularly. I hope I made a good choice. The price was nice!
2,"Basically sturdy, poor workmanship","Received this item yesterday. It feels basically solid, but I was very disappointed to see how misaligned the ""jaws"" are. When adjusting, they don't come together evenly, and the closest they come together is about 3/16"". So you won't be able to use it with small bits, even though the packaging states that it can be used with bits of ""all sizes.""I'll probably keep it, but will likely need to pay a bit more for one of higher quality."
3,Brace with a bite,I only gave my product review 3 because my particular brace gear / pawl ratchet slips & has a defect.Otherwise4 stars if compared to similiar designs from other companies.5 stars for being the most economical brace combined with good materials.I believe if I had a non-defective brace like this it would be a fully functional economical brace that would last awhile under normal use.Plastic handles is of good quality & will not respond to moisture like wood handles that sometimes crack if not cared for.I dont who to contact for a replacement. I purchased mine here.This brace is plated great & the 4 jaws chuck appears to be hardened & is made of quality metal & tightens well.Inside the chuck there is a square recess made to fit vintage traditional non hex auger bits.The brace didn't work well with hex shank bits.It will grip round bits & older auger bits securely.As always use sharp augers & drill bits for the best performance & ease of use.
1,Piece of poo,"Crude, clunky, junky, and the knob would only allow about 2/3 of a turn before it froze up.Low, low, Chinese quality.In other words, overpriced anywhere over $1.50."
2,poor design,The drill has a poorly designed chuck (part that holds the bit). It will not hold a bit tight enough for drilling many types of wood.
3,Compact Edition,"No Yusef Lateef, Roland Kirk Jimmy Knepper or Toshiko on this 1 CD version. 2 groups play with Charles McPherson and Jaki Byard in both of them. McPherson being featured on I Can't Get Started.It's a self admitted bootleg by the authors of More Than a Fake Book, but the sound quality is reasonable. This is the only recorded version of Monk Bunk and Vice Versa, being too similar to Monk's - Well You Needn't to be recorded again. I will not venture to speculate how Mingus's rather loud bowed bass solo in between solos by Richard Williams and Booker Ervin on Take The A Train was accomplished.Eddie Amoure and Pepper Adams are in the second group but Adams sounds a bit off mic"
5,My students were moved,"I don't remember how I found this video, but it has become a staple of my WWI curriculum. It is hard to pick out a few parts to highlight because this is one of best videos I have seen. From the discussions of whether to send the soldiers home to fervor over how African American women would go over to France, you get a great picture of how this war changed the way we deal with those who have given their lives for our country. Even my macho football players were surprised by how they were affected by watching this video. It makes you think not just of the soldiers who died, but of the families they left behind."
3,the picture is wrong,The product that is actually shipped is not the item in the picture. The actual product has a standard springform bottom made of glass instead of a metal. The picture shows what looks to be a platter.
3,Not for me,I found this book to be somewhat slow and dragging. A little on the sweet & mushy side for me & I struggled to finish reading it
5,one of my new favorites.,loved this book...only have read a few by madline baker and i have loved all of them.I loved Clay and Hallie's story .Anyone who love historical romance with the lakota people will like this book.
2,Minor,"This product was viewed briefly. Not much into the costumes, story line nor the color and sound. Need time to view again"
4,Jennifer Jones,"Jennifer Jones was never lovelier than she is in this film. I always thought she was not a great actress. She was made famous by her husband David O. Selznick. He even created as big a stir for""Duel in the Sun"" as there was for ""Gone with the Wind"" It opened to (2) theatre here and it was a dismal flop even with Gregory Peck and Joseph Cotton fighting for her love.Van heflin in this film is so great. Louis Jourdan acting as a stud just doesnt cut it. This film should get a remake it would be great now that all inhibitions have been removed from the industry.The film holds up well to have been made in 1949 both in entertainment and the transfer is perfect,so sharp clear and crisp..."
1,Not the tape in the picture,Please note that this is not the 1949 version with Jennifer Jones. This is the 1991 version with Isabelle Huppert. The mixed information above led me to buy this even though I had already seen (and disliked) the Huppert version.
3,What did they DOOOO!?!?,"Madame Bovary is one of my favorite books, and since I love old movies (pre-1955), I was eager to see this film adapation of it. Jennifer Jones is a sucky Emma. She's a good actress, but she is just not as beautiful or strained as Emma was supposed to be. I think the perfect person for the role of Emma would've been Joan Bennet. This movie was totally risque for the 1940s. It still got over the message of the story though, and it made me cry. But Jennifer Jones was not right for the part, I think."
5,How a master can improve a musical ideom,"As someone who has listened to this recording constantly since I bought it 5 years ago, I have not got bored of it yet since beautiful emotional playing is never boring.Like Miles' other work with Marcus Miller in the 80's; It is not innovative and technically brilliant as his work was in the late 50's/ late 60's.What it show is how a master can vastly improve a musical ideom.In this case it is1. taking 80's fusion and subtracting some techinique (fusion cliches) and adding great amounts of emotion.2. Taking the Kenny G type sound and adding tons more variety, technique and emotion.In Amanda, the emotion is really flowing and this recording would be recommended for anyone who want to hear a bit of vastly improved sweet jazz without the artifical saccarine flavor and cliches of such aforementioned ideoms"
3,observe history,"All major gains in muscularity in the past 40 years or more have been due to non-training aspects: Drugs and a larger talent pool of physiques. Show me -one- person who's more muscular now than anyone previously, who claims to owe it to the methods of John Little or Pete Sisco.

The fact is that if you train sincerely for year with any of the traditional methods, you will be much stronger, and have much more muscle. -How- much is limited by your age, and that so general term:""genetics"".

4,GOOD RESORCE FOR STRENGHT GAINS,"THIS BOOK MAKES ALOT OF SENCE AND TAKES ALL THE GUESS WORK OUT OF BODYBUILDING AND STRENGHT TRAINING. A MUST READ, YOU WILL NEVER TRAIN THE SAME WAY AGAIN."
5,An excellent book for any Disney enthusiast!,"What makes this book a great find is that it includes many songs for rides that have either been refurbished or altogether removed from the Walt Disney World Resort (ie - Spaceship Earth's ""Tomorrow's Child"" and Kitchen Kabaret's ""Veggie Veggie Fruit Fruit"") Also, one of my favorite songs, ""Golden Dream"" from Epcot's American Adventure is also included! The songs are fairly simple to play (guitar chords are written in) for any experience level. I'm so glad I found this book and added it to my collection!"
2,Antietam???,"Sorry, but I can't agree with other reviewers who say this is a ""great"" book. Of 358 pages, only 12 actually deal with the battle of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle of the Civil War. I'm no historian, but I know something of that battle and think that, even for an historical novel, Reasoner treats Antietam with too little regard for what it meant to the whole of the war.While the book is a good read, its title is misleading."
3,Cost of Life,"Three for three, the ""Battle of Antietam"" just like ""Manassas"" and ""Shiloh"" were given space at the end of the story. This book's focus is on two of the brothers Will and Mac. There is an interesting romance with Titus and Polly. This is an easy and fun read. You will like it if you don't mind the way the author treats ""Antietam."" By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
5,A beautiful soundtrack..,"The soundtrack to Ghost World is amazing. I have been obsessed with the graphic novel and now with the movie, so I had to buy the album.The theme from Ghost World (Track 20) is great. It's touching and definitely contains a lot of emotions. One of my favorites is Skip James' ""Devil Got My Woman"" (Track 3). I cannot even put into words how beautiful this song is. You definitely get what Enid was feeling in the movie when she played it. I dance in my room like Enid to ""Jaan Pehechaan Ho"" (Track 1) all the time-- it is very enjoyable.The whole cd is filled with great songs, it is definitely worth it. If you share the love of Ghost World, Enid, and Seymour, or you just like old records, buy it. It's a beautiful thing."
3,No Buzzcocks? What do I get?,I know this is supposed to be a blues/big brass comp but do you think they could've substituted the blues and rap parodies for real songs? The Buzzcocks and Patience & Prudence tracks are legendary and would have made this album a total classic. This disappointment forced me to give this soundtrack only 3 stars even though the rest of the soundtrack is 5 star material. A perfect compliment to a bottle of hard stuff.
4,"Outstanding soundtrack, but a few complaints","The standout tracks on this soundtrack, are definitely Jaan Pehechaan Ho, Devil Got My Woman, Bye Bye Baby Blues, and the Ghost World theme. My only problems are that What Do I Get? and A Smile and a Ribbon aren't included, and Graduation Rap and Pickin'Cotton Blues are. Other than that, the Ghost World soundtrack is the best soundtrack I've ever listened to."
4,A record withh music hard to find,"Initially, when a I saw the movie last year in cable TV, I was captivaded by the ""Bollywood"" song that appears at the begining of the movie. Then I began to search for info about the soundtrack and I found out something trully remarkable: three tracks had titles related to my country of origin, Venezuela. Those are ""Palmas de Maracaibo"", ""Miranda"" and ""Venezuela"", which were written and played by a unique musician with an exotic history, Lionel Belasco. Since then I've become addicted to this record. That's why I trully recommend it."
5,BEAR HATER,"This is the Happy Schnapps Five CD that started it all. If you are a Packer Fan you need to know the words to "" The Bears Still Suck""."
4,"A fast, worthwhile read --","In Beep! Beep!, Bell and Harari provide the reader with an entertaining look at business practice and culture today. In highlighting the behavior and actions of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, the authors provide a compare and contrast view of all facets of business and a unique perspective on how to be more competitive. The message is simple and clear, capturing the spirit of what it takes to compete in the fast-paced, global marketplace. (The book's preface is: ""Road Runners don't have prefaces...they just begin!"") Although the boxes which describe actual scenes from the Road Runner cartoons get a bit redundant as the book moves along, the ""Birdseed"" and ""Tail Feathers"" sections that summarize most of the chapters were appropriate and welcome. All-in-all, Beep! Beep! is a worthwhile read. It can easily be consumed in an average plane ride (as I did)."
4,Ineresting way to get a point across,"A How to Business book is normally outside my lane. However, I glanced at the cover and thought this is what my husband keeps claiming is needed even for the Feds in an international economy. Plus I must admit I grew up with brilliant self-destructive Wile eating the Road Runner's dust. I decided to read this book and found it humorously entertaining with references to the Warner cartoon universe and with specific pointers on how to compete in the age of overwhelming instant information where objects communicate and not just in C language. Though quite interesting, well written, and cleverly packaged, this how to not suicide in business by really trying. It offers nothing new even with its ""seven new rules of the road"". Sports teams from the fifties and sixties or even the recent Yankees and Bulls understood and implemented that teamwork and learning are the keys to winning.Harriet Klausner"
4,"brutal, enjoyable and earcleaning","the latest, the best. the pure melting of trash and death metal; chuck billy does really kikc ass with his unique vocals so good not to be describe"
4,Change is good.....why couldnt metallica & megadeth do this?,"When a band changes, it gains and loses fans. So why do bands sell out? Why not become heavier...faster...(or even release an acoustic album).... include more solos... better interesting riffs?? Why must bands REMOVE solos, get annoying vocals, cut their hair, lose melody, and become mainstream? This is one of the only bands who actually evovled into something MTV would never play. Good job, you were true to metal"
4,well that was unexpected,"This cd from the first track just catches you off guard...Chuck takes a different turn on the vocals and really pushes how heavy the band can be. Low comes out to suprise you with who the band was. While this coems out with an explosion with who the band could really be. We read reviews of how good Alex Skolnick really is. He is an amazing guitarist but james has really placed a mark on the band behind some of their hardest and heaviest hitting cds. While the sheer talent and skill may not be their the heart is and I will listen to James any day over Alex. The cd has all the riffs, power and heaviness of low, but brings a new element, chuck is now pushing his vox beyond the norm. A large death metal aspect is added to this thrash metal band that adds pounds per pounds and punch for punch heavieness. While still not my all time fav this lies near low and just under The Gathering. Testament is a force to be dealt with and these are the cds that have made their mark."
3,GOOD ONE FROM TESTAMENT!!!!,"DEMONIC got some good TESTAMENT songs like JOHN DOE and THE BURNING TIMES...but is BY FAR the TESTAMENT album i care less...After one of their BEST EVER LOW, the band got only Eric Peterson and the GREAT Chuck Billy...and the songs are TOTALLY DEATH/BLACK METAL!!!!! i think it's rawer and heavier than what PANTERA and SEPULTURA were doing at the same time, at the late 90's....well, i like most ALL the stuff TESTAMENT recorded, but DEMONIC is the TESTAMENT one i think is not so great....The best ones are THE NEW ORDER, PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH, LOW, THE GATHERING and FORMATION OF DAMNATION!!!! TESTAMENT RULES!!!!!!"
5,"This band has made the transition, and reached the pinnacle.","This is a Testament to what ""Testament"" is capable of. This is by far the best album this band has ever created and I pray that they continue down this path. Gone is the Testament of the 80's and here is the Testament of the future. This album rivals the heaviest stuff of Fear Factory, Slayer, and bands of the like. If your into the heavyest metal, you need to pick this album up. You will not be sorry!"
1,a turn for the worse,"testament was allways a thrash band low had death metal tone but thrash none the less.this cd was a true shock they went death with the help of gene hoglan dark angel,glen alvereze formerly of forbidden and fill in for scholnick and original member derick remiureze erics cousin.they should have excelled or atleast held their ground but no the turned a worse corner than commercial overtones of the ritual fame they went death metal yea?it's heavy but so is rosana bar!this cd is totally lacking in the creative zone it's just poor writing and musicanship and direction with one exception the first track it's a very good song that should have been saved for the next cd(the gathering and expanded upon to meash with the other songs well)this was evidently recorded for the money because they could have gone 500% better"
3,Mediocre,"""Demonic"" is now sandwiched between ""Low"" and ""The Gathering"", both far superior to this one. The music fails to really get going on here. Not really ever bad, but it doesn't have any punch. Chuck's death metal growl on ""The Gathering"" shows much growth and depth. On here he sounds monotonous and out of place, especially since the music isn't all that heavy. As a Testament fan I found a handful of songs that I liked and if your a fan then you will likely do the same, overall this was just not that engaging."
2,Jun-Jun ????????????,"It's hard to rate such an album. If its purpose is to be a good thrash metal album, than it gets five out of five stars. Noisy, furious and dumb, all thrash metal of this kind is meant to be. Because of that, all the 11 songs sound exactly the same. What is missing is some female vocals and violin parts here and there. Then at least this could be considered a pleasant listening... The way it is, far from that..."
2,testament is a thrash band.!- this is not testament!!,"this cd dosen't represent testament in my eyes at all just a lost broke band lokking to cash in!yea I said that Eric and Chuck needed the money they got adamn fine drummer gene Hoglan(dark angel)and Eric's cousin Derek Ramirez and Glen Alvelaz(ex-forbidden)to but down some solo's.thishad alot of possiblities to be a great cd but it ends up being just a poorly exicuted death metal cd that has only one great song track to my demonic the title track n the main reason to own this cd or just buy the best of with it on it and the draw the line & sails of carion, covers on them.this d just dose not excite me it possible hit the bargin bin quicker then metallica's load/reload cds or new GnR cd.It just is not great thrash that testament known for they might reach for death metal sound and riffs sometimes but that's not what most fans like from them."
3,Hammering...,"This CD is an odd one to me. It rips and burns like crazy on the guitars and the vocals are thick and meaty - but it seems only half inspired in moments. For all the brutal ""death metal"" derived rage the album falls short of the greatness of the old thrash records and the power of ""The Gathering"". Riding the line...but not in a good way sometimes.Standouts though do occur on this record...mostly notably ""John Doe"" and ""Demonic Refusal"". Both songs are primed and FULL of piss and vinegar.Overall...this CD is a worthy buy...but really seems stuck in a transitional mode."
4,I'm caught in the BURNING TIMES !!!!!!!!!!,"What can I say, this album rips !!!!!!! Demonic is a perfect title for this album because it sounds Demonic. It might be hard to swallow at first but belive me, it grows on you like cancer. I think this album scared off some Testament fans cause of the way Chuck Billy sings on it. Most of the album his voice sounds like death metal but the funny thing is that it works, it sounds great. Highlites for me on this album are the opening track ""Demonic Refusal"" ""Burning Times"" ""John Doe"" and ""Hatdreds Rise"". I you like metal and Testament, don't let this one pass you by. One more thing,if you want to pick up an even better album, get their next album ""The Gathering"" it's a classic !!!!!!! D. N. R. !!!!!!!!!!"
3,Decent.,"The Good:- Drum Legend Gene Hoglan is in the band.- Eric Peterson isn't placed in the shadows of another guitar player, since he is doing the guitar work himslf.- Shows another side of Testament.The Bad:- Chuck Billy's death metal voice isn't great. Mind you, i'm not a big death metal fan in the first place. (with the exception of Death.)- Hoglan's drum skills aren't shown very good on this album.- Demonic is slower.It is an alright album, but certainly not one of their finer ones. If you are new to this band, don't start your collection here."
5,A Passionate guide for would be rose growers.,"The author's passion for roses shows on every page. The details on soil, nourishment, planting location, climate are highly valuable. Even creating new roses is covered. The photos and history of every selected plant show lots of devoted research. The listing of Rose nurseries and organizations saves lots of planning time. Love that book."
3,Awkward,"This episode is not the greatest. The actors showed no signs of chemistry. This is weird because if you look at episodes 4 and 6, there is lots of chemistry. It feels like this is the first time the actors met each other. Also, why didn't they just use a shuttlecraft? I know the shuttlecraft wouldn't be seen until The Galileo Seven but it still annoys me."
4,Fascinating,"Due to a transporter accident, Captain Kirk is split into two beings, each possessing different facets of Kirk's personality. This episode postulates some interesting ideas about ourselves, including the very nature of human beings. It has given me things to ponder about human nature. Most intriguing."
3,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type pretense.,Interesting plot examining the roles of good and evil in individuals. The only thing that is not good is the way attempted rape is regarded.
5,The most complete baseball training series,"Dr. Bragg Stockton is a legend in the baseball world. He has coached at every level from Little League to High School to College, including the well-respected programs at University of Houston and San Jacinto Junior College. He has trained over 10,000 young men in his summer baseball camps. And over 80 of his players went on to play professional baseball.This series of videos captures many valuable nuggets of knowledge that Dr. Stockton learned and taught throughout the years. I still review the whole series every year and rediscover things to share with my teams.Jeff Noreman[...]"
4,A Somewhat quickie affair....,"I agree with another reviewer in that Batman sounds not only rather dated, but also has the feel that it was recorded in a quick amount of time.Don't get me wrong, I do like this album, but I believe with alittle more effort into some of the tracks would make it a full A+ album.I am probably in the minority when I say that my favorite track on here is the hit of the album, Batdance.The only other tracks on here I like are Scandalous, The Future, and Partyman.A--"
3,I'm not feeling it!,"Batman is one of two Prince albums that's flirting in the 2-3 star range so far (Prince is the other). Although ""Batdance"" and ""Scandelous"" are probably some of the best songs on the album, they hardly break any new ground. Other great songs include ""The Future""(this song saved it from being 2 stars) and ""Partyman"". Overall, Batman is JUST a album to listen to and that's it! There's nothing here that will get you out of your seat."
4,Stands Up Pretty Well,"Although thrown together (figuratively speaking) overnight, most of the songs on here hold up pretty well. ""Batdance"" and ""Partyman"" are party jams that Prince could only have written and recorded in 1989. My favorite track is ""Vicki Waiting"", a mid-tempo soul/rock number that actually gets into Bruce Wayne's brain fairly well (although I doubt Bruce thinks about sex as much as Prince does). A good 'nuff album whether you're a Batophile or no."
2,A bit misleading,"The soundtrack is VERY good, which is why I came to amazon to take a chance on it. Bit the seller said his item for purchase was collector quality. It was not. He/she either doesn't know about what they were talking about or they lied. Either way I wish they could give me some of my money back. The record has a decent amount of wear and tear (which is okay) but it doesn't ever play without skipping in thd same spots every time. I hope I'm their only dissatisfied customer."
3,Scandalous,"I bought the Batman Soundtrack for one track: Scandalous.It's my 2nd favorite Prince song. (If I Was Your Girlfriend is 1st) It's so sexy and brooding. I just love the music; and the lyrics sound like they were written for a woman to sing, which makes it even more seductive.Of course, even when you buy an album for one song, there's almost always other songs you end up liking as well. Batdance is good even though it's a cut and paste of other song clips and dialogue. Lemon Crush, Partyman, and Vicki Waiting are also cool. Arms of Orion is nice even if a little sappy. The rest are listenable but don't stick with you.No one will confuse the Batman music here with Purple Rain's, but it's a nice pick up for earnest Prince fans, or people who just want Batdance and Scandalous, which were left off Prince's The Hits/B-sides greatest hits collection."
2,One of Prince's weakest Entries but still enjoyable,"Prince dashed this album off fairly quickly and was rewarded with a number one album and single (""Batdance"") as seemingly everything connected with Batman leapt off shelves in the summer of 1989.If this album does not belong in the same universe as masterpieces such as Sign o' the Times and Purple Rain, this album is not a bomb. It is actually fun, but light and disposable. ""Batdance"" and ""Electric Chair"" are the best songs with ""The Future,"" ""Partyman,"" and ""Vicki's Waiting"" coming in next.So in sum, if not a bad listen, this album is hardly essential. With so many other better Prince albums (and with so many great albums in general), I am not sure why anyone would want to invest much time here."
4,Batman meets Prince,"If you enjoy Prince, you will enjoy this CD. It has the typical Prince sound although there is dialogue from the movie incorporated into some songs. The songs on this album revolve around the movie."
2,Two good songs. That's it.,"""Scandalous"" is a great falsetto let's-get-it-on ballad. ""Batdance"" is an unusual and catchy experiment in sound collage. The rest of this ""soundtrack"" is Prince-by-the-numbers, not even worthy of the B-sides collected on his 3-CD greatest hits collection. A platinum relic of ""corporate synergy"" at its stupidest."
2,Made in a short time ...,"I consider this Prince album the weakest ...Made in 2 or 3 weeks ( I don't know exactly ) and it can be feeled when listening to most of the songs. Only Partyman, Vicky Waiting and Batdance are the exceptions, which are quite good. Lemon Crush is terrible, just listen to the drum-machine he used ... Electric Chair is another made-in-a-short-time song, very-very monotonious ... The Future, the first song is a well done, but have a few instruments unfortunately.I think after Lovesexy and before Graffiti Bridge, which is another excellent album, this one is that I just cannot compare 2 them, it is so weak from Prince ..."
1,bland,electric chair and partyman are alright.but this disc sounds like it was rushed and in many ways doesn't go with the film.
1,It's Just Too Weird For My Taste!,"I saw the movie Batman starring Michael Keaton on the big screen and later I recieved the movie on video as a present and I think it's ok, but I also got this Batman soundtrack and I don't like it, it's too weird! I don't like even 1 song on it, I have been trying for years to give away and get rid of this CD and no one wants it, I thought at least one person would want a free CD so they could build up their CD collection, but no one will take it even for free, everyone tells me I should just throw it out but I hate to waste things so I might try this new store near me that buys used CD's or lets you trade them."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,AS SOON AS I HEARD THIS SOUNDTRACK I SANG IT AL OVERMY HOUS. IT WAS GOOD. IT WAS GREAT. IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Mediocrity,I think Prince rushed on the Batman CD. The songs he wrote had nothing to do with the movie. ''Batdance'' was good though.
3,BATMANNN!!!,"Okay, this album was alright. It's not my favorite, but I'm glad I have it. The best song on it is Batdance. Definitely worth getting if you don't already have it. Don't spend more than $7 on it though (Plus S&H if you're ordering online)."
3,Batprince.,"My thinking on this soundtrack has always been, that if it was a normal Prince album, and didn't have the Batman connection, people would regard it as one of his better ones. Ok, I admit it's no ""Sign O' The Times"" or ""Lovesexy"", but it did come out at the end of what was his best decade. Even if I kept this just for the sample-filled ""Batdance"" and the beautiful ""Arms Of Orion"", it would be worth it. Toss on ""The Future"" and ""Trust"" and it's a must for fans."
1,Buttons Stick,I purchased a Hohner D40 concertina a couple of weeks ago and fell in love with it. I immediately noticed one button kept getting stuck after I played with it. I would have to pull on it to free it after playing each time. Annoying to say the least!!!Then a day later I noticed one of the buttons didn't make any sound at all. Now I had two buttons causing me problems. It looks decent and sounds nice but what is the point of having an instrument if you can't play it! The handle had a screw that kept coming loose. I thought this particular one was maybe a fluke so I sent it back and got another one. I just wanted to be able to play a concertina and the price was decent. So I gave it another try. Well I got the second one today and lo and behold a button sticks again. Well it's going back and I am still on the lookout for a decent concertina with buttons that doesn't stick. I hope I can find one that works for me.
1,too cheap,"cheaply made, if you're looking for an affordable concertina that's a whole lot better, try a Rochelle. this thing is painful to play after a while. not worth the money"
1,China Made Crap,Broke after 10 minutes of playing. Refer to the other reviews. If I had I'd have done then what I'm going to do now... spend the money on a better one.
3,Hohner Concertina,"This instrument came with the C and G keys, on the right hand, reversed. Once my husband opened the instrument and turned the buttons around, it played beautifully. If he weren't so handy, I would have returned it and missed all the fun!"
1,Defective,It was defective and the replacement was no better. The company agreed to a refund so I decided not to keep the item.
5,AWESOMENESS,"mmm, the Concertina is an under estimated musical device. I have played this many times at talent shows and the joy just spreads. It could be annoying to some but purchase and practice will make you happy and thats key isnt happiness is key, if you dont like it please, do not hate me for it."
1,AVOID!,"One should be especially careful when purchasing archival recordings. The sources utilized to put this project together are extremely low quality, but sadly, very typical of the industry these days. Most of the selections on this album were sourced from old 78s, incorporating some cheap software to ""mask"" the pops and clicks. The results are disastrous!Ronnie Hilton does not deserve this kind of showcase! If you are a Hilton fan, you would do well to pre-order ""The Ultimate Ronnie Hilton"". This new 2-disc project will be out in June and truly represents the career of Ronnie Hilton. I happen to know that Ronnie's wife was consulted for this release and there is no better authority on the Hilton legacy that Chrissie Hilton."
4,Must see,This movie is a must see for all of those who love movie classics. Takes place in the 50's and will remind many of the days when they were young. Cute and funny.
1,Dissappointed by condition of movie,I love this movie but when mine arrived it was blank. The others I ordered worked fine. I just returned it.
3,"Giget is Sandra Dee, in Hawaii, Malibu, or anywhere else!","This movie is good--except for Deborah Walley. She is not Gidget, Sandra Dee is! Ms. Walley is TOTALLY phoney! Desite that, the plot and story is cute."
4,Gidget is back in her same mischievous form!,"If you liked the first Gidget movie, you will also like this one! This movie is a bit funnier than the first, and Gidget perhaps more feisty. Deborah Walley is cute in the role. Storyline is somewhat less sophisticated, but Gidget fans will not be disappointed as she faces a rival girl and almost loses her reputation!! END"
3,One of the more delightful holiday reads.....,but there was nothing truly outstanding about this collection. As an avid reader of Christmas anthologies and stories I have seen much better work than this collection.However it's still a lovely read and worth the time. I'd rather borrow it than buy it though.
3,Didn't capture my attention at all,"No standouts in this anthology but I did enjoy the Kleypas offering the best. None of them really captured my heart. I dragged my way through each one. Perhaps if the other stories were by authors I've enjoyed before (like Kleypas), I might have understood the style but... really not much to recommend here."
2,One Out Of Four,"I found the Lisa Kleypas & Lynsay Sands stories to be so bad as to be unreadable. The only good one is by Lisa Cach, but even that is not worth paying hardcover prices for. Give this one a miss, or at least wait until it's out in paperback."
3,Lisa Kleypas Makes the Book.,"The only reason I gave this book 3 stars was because of ""I Will"". I am a huge fan of Lisa Kleypas and was pleasantly surprised to see Andrew, Lord Drake, with his own story. The other authors I was not familiar with, but I read their stories with the hope I would find new authors to read. But, alas, I found myself disappointed. I know it's hard to develop characters as in depth in novellas, but most of the characters in the last three novellas had little or none. I give this book a good rating for choosing Lisa Kleypas, but not the others. Sorry to the other authors' fans."
4,"Finally, a musical-sounding Metronome","The Korg KDM-2 fills a niche in my studio that isn't filled by other metronomes, in that it sounds remarkably like a well-recorded set of wood blocks. I've often noted that musicians have trouble following a click track that's just an electronic ""beep"". Not so with the KDM-2, which sounds like another musical instrument.On the donwside, it's missing a feature for studio use - a dedicated line level output, and, as had been sited in other reviews, the jog wheel used to select tempo is rather stiff and difficult to use one-handed. A little knob sticking out of the wheel instead of the all-but-useless indentation would fix this problem at little cost. Y'all at Korg listening? With very little extra effort, this could be the best studio metronome out there."
5,Nice loud metronome,"I have the older model of this metronome and I like this one better. It has a digital dial, so you can get any speed. It has a volume control and it gets really loud so you can hear it even during forte passages. It has a button that you can tap out the tempo you want and it converts it to a number, so you don't have to guess. Overall a great metronome and Amazon had it at a good price."
5,True Tone Metronome,"Bought this for my 7 year old daughter who is studying violin. We had some nice electronic metronomes that came as freebies with her violins (she's gone from a 1/8 to a 3/4 in two years) but we found they simply were not loud enough to be heard over the violin. This one is nice and loud, easy to use, and costs less than other similar ones. We are very pleased with it."
1,Stopped working after two months,Ours stopped working after two months. Does not even turn on. Tried changing batteries. Unfortunately it is too late to send it back.
1,Doodle Cake,"I purchased this metronome because I liked the PCM sounds and the various rhythm functions. The functions are pretty cool, but the tempo dial is very difficult to turn. It took me form 1 to 2 minutes to change the tempo between exercises/songs.Very frustrating device to use because of this issue. I am sending it back and I will pick a different metronome. Doesn't anybody do quality control anymore?If your looking for a metronome that is easy to use, keep looking. Maybe mine was defective, but based on customer pictures I've seen of this device where they stick something on the tempo dial so they can turn it, I'd say I'm not the only one to have this issue.Too bad. This is otherwise a cool metronome. But I won't tolerate poor design or workmanship that causes me frustration. This is 2010. Get your head out of your butts, Korg!"
1,Worked Perfectly then Died.....,"This metronome worked perfectly when we first bought it in October 2011. Nice and loud, which we needed becuase 2 of my daughters play the violin and other metronomes were hard to hear. Now, in April of 2012, the thing just died on us. Sigh."
2,Major flaw,"Like the other lowballer, York, I too found the metronome to be clever, stylish, but with a major flaw. I liked the wheel and large digital display, much easier to jump to different values without those tedious up and down buttons. But the wheel is almost impossible to turn if on a music stand! One has to put down their instrument, use one hand to hold the metronome, and one finger to turn the wheel. Even that is a bit challenging due to the stylish but useless indent on the wheel. Still, I liked the product enough to risk a modification. I driilled a tiny hole in the wheel, and then screwed a 1/4 inch bead on the wheel so I could push the wheel around with one finger(I have the metronome in a frame to hold it tightly to the music stand. Works great though I could have easily ruined the entire product by drilling too far. But one wonders why this couldnt have been done by the designers, who may or may not be musicians who practice using a music stand."
1,Nice Features if it Worked for more than a month,"This metronome has all the right features but I have had THREE of them in 6 months. They work fine, then stop, change the batteries then it may or may not work again. I am done returning this model - time to find something reliable."
4,The versatile and user friendly metronome,"This device is impressive. It is easy to use and has a volume a classroom can follow. It is something your skill level can grow with, and it's great on batteries. The dial can have nobbies to grab onto to make it perfect."
2,Not impressed,The name of this book is 'the 72 names of God'. Unfortunately these 72 names are all made up. What about the real names for G-d. Like Hashem and Eloheim and Adonai. Where did those flutter off to? Because those names are not included or explained. This book is a total misrepresentation. It eschews traditional kabbalah and its only merit is as a coffee table book or an art book. The title is totally deceiving.Seth J. Frantzman
5,A wonderful book!!!,"This is a very interesting book. I fully recommend it to anyone looking for spiritual answers. You may not agree with everything -- and that's OK. But take whatever you get from this book and simply make it yours. You don't have to become a follower of Kabbalah to put some of the ideas into practice. Try it. You may like it.Also recommended: ""What Did Jesus Really Say, How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information]"" by Peter Cayce"
1,:-(,"First of all, as one of the reviewers mentioned, this book has nothing to do with kabala. Second, there are no explanations regarding why the 72 three-letter combinations mean what the writer says they do, you just have to take his word for it. Third, they do not appear to work at all, and I gave it an honest open-minded try. Finally, when at the end of the book pronunciations of the letter combinations are given, some letters have numerous pronunciations, which further diminishes credibility of his whole theory."
1,Not in new condition ..!!,The seller post a this beutiful book .. And siad it was in a new condition .. It was not .. !!This seller is not a good seller ..
1,Demonic Influences to Be Avoided,"In 2010, Jesus Christ appeared to me, warning me of things to come. Books like this are of the demonic realm and should be avoided. What the author calls ""technology"" is nothing but Satanic philosophy pretending to create what cannot be brought about without the power of Jesus Christ to transform the human soul. To experience your new life, you must repent of your sins, deny yourself, and live through the power of the Resurrection and shed blood of Jesus Christ."
5,Visual Mantras,"I love sitting down with this book. The letters do seem to have a calming effect on me. Believe me, I was highly skeptical when I bought it. The affirmations are really excellent too. Sometimes when things at work get utterly crazy, or life itself gets stressful, looking at this book reminds me to keep things in perspective, not be overly reactive or dramatic, to treat others well, and etc. It encourages finishing projects, seeing the big picture, being environmentally responsible, forgiving, and really, every good trait that a person could have. We know these things, but we need to be reminded. We need to work on them. I have almost worn mine out and will need to order a new one----that's how imperfect I am, but hey, I am working on it!"
2,Not Authentic Kabbalah,"This is totally opposite Kabbalah Methodology. This book is a psychological aid. The Kabbalah Center is a for profit organizaition and does not promote true spiritual attainment. For the Truth, see Rav. Laitmans Books, a true Kabbalist who has attained spirituality. See Kabbalah.info for all free material and all the right intentions."
3,"Interesting, but does it work?","I used to scan the Kabbalah names of God, but I didn't really notice any thing significantly different.But then again, the things I wanted / want are pretty big.Still, I liked this book. However, the colors make the book symbols not as clear as they could be. The previous edition was better. It had clearer symbols. More definitive colors. Easier to visualize and/or meditate on.In any case, here's another interesting book that I recently finished. It reflects on Kabbalah. It goes into how Jesus may have practiced Kabbalah. Worth taking a look at. Definitely worth reading.What Did Jesus Really Say-How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information] -- by Peter Cayce"
1,Nothing to do with Kabbalah,"I was very disappointed with this new book of Yehuda Berg. Kabbalah is a way of life and a way of looking at things, and can be very inspiring. Although his first book, ""The Power of Kabbalah"" had some good points, this one is really a waste of time and money. Go for the serious book on the subject, this one will give you a false image of what Kabbalah is."
1,Dangerous content.,"I am an Orthodox Jew and I bought this book with the intention of praying the 72 Names of G-d, but instead, I got a book that tells me that I am god, sin isn't a reality, and that I am in control of everything around me. I burned the book, lest someone else got ahold of it and actually believed that nonsense."
2,Not Really a Kabbalah Book,"Maybe its me. I just don't get it. It is a nice book. It references the Kabbalah. It has 72 names for God in Hebrew. I can even meditate on each name or it's concept.The question is why? Use it for daily affirmations or whatever you like, but I don't consider this as any type of reading material if you are interested in the Kabbalah.I appreciate the author's love for his work, but would have liked to see a little more."
2,Coffee Table Book with Little-to-No Value,"This book is difficult to read because of the colors and stylistic layout. If you believe in meditation and the Kabbalah Centre's choice of 72 names and what they mean, then go ahead and use it... but it is downright frustrating to read. I had to strain my eyes to read parts, which was not relaxing or helpful at all.For students of the Kabbalah Centre only--no other school of Kabbalah or Jewish authority supports this book and its claims."
2,A Vegetarian Bread Book,"I bought this book based on other reviews, but it is only a good bread book if you like to use ingredients such as soy milk, tofu, sprouted wheat, triticale, etc. If you want a much better bread book using whole grains and reasonable ingredients, buy Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book. If you want a great book on making great bread, buy either Crust and Crumb or The Bread Baker's Apprentice."
5,"What a sad, pathetic (but unique) creature!","An extraordinary life - an extraordinary misfit. Richard Witts is a very learned man and has done an amazing lot of research to create a classy bio of this totally spoilt, self-centred and, inevitably, tragic creature. His style may be a bit too much for the reviewer below, but don't be put off - this is an absorbing read. It will, inevitably, reach about as few people as her music did, so I salute Mr Witts for taking on this task. By the way, James Young's book ""Songs They Never Play On The Radio"" documents his time playing with Nico in the eighties.While it is not in the same class as this book, it complements it as Mr Witts has, understandably, focussed on the more important earlier years."
5,plate or biscuit joiner?,Is there a difference between a plate joiner and a biscuit joiner? I want to purchase a joiner and don't want a low quality one but am unfamiliar with the terminology.
4,Here's To You,"I've never heard any songs on this albumn other than the title track, Here's To You. But that one song from back in 1964, can bring back those early teen years for me, with all the joy, heartache, and longing to be that was the 60's.It was a simplier and much more complex time rolled into one era, something that comes through in the music, but never in the history books.This is a song that has remained special to me for all these years. If you've not heard it, or simply do not remember it... Now is a great time to enjoy the beautifully simply words and wonderful voice of Hamilton Camp."
5,Great basic book,"When I had the author as an instructor in 1997 I didn't give the book enough credit (thinking it's because he's teaching out of his own book that things seem so clear)...Several years later, with a library of reference books on various topics of statistics, I still recommend this book as one of the best for those seeking a grounding in the basics without measure theory."
4,very fun,the set is a great starter set and i love it. its durable and fun. the weel on the tank broke but you cant notice it at all. the truck was a little bent and i cant fix it but its fun anyway. this was the first set i ever got. and its what got me intrestide in army men. it also is a good set and qualitie for the price aspecaly if it started you getting intrestid in army men like me. get this.
4,Sensors,"There's not enough information about the problems that occur when certain ""sensors"" are not functioning properly. It seems to be a guessing game."
4,Your basic repair manual,"The usual Haynes style repair manual for a Shadow/Sundance. Good info for someone who is not a mechanic, but trying to be a DIY-er to save some $$$."
5,The Ebony Buddy Holly,Whenever I hear this rockin cat he reminds me of the great Buddy Holly. That same kind of tone and energy without the hiccups of course. This is a great cd and he should've been a bigger star and should be remembered a whole lot better on today's Oldies stations regardless of what music research or some consultant infactuates.
5,Great upper body workouts,"I have read all of Brad Schoenfeld's books and think he is one of the best fitness authors around. He explains things in a very understandable fashion and his approach is very cutting edge. This book is particularly good. It has specific workouts for the upper body muscles. Those who own his book, ""Look Great Naked"" will be familiar with a good deal of the material as he uses the same basic principles to create the routines (combining 3 different exercises that work different parts of the muscle). The exercises are very unique. I've been training for a long time and never even heard of some of them. He gives lots of alternatives for variety which is good because it stops you from getting bored. I will be using these workouts as part of my routine for many years to come."
4,Decent but not my favorite,I like the pictures of how the exercises are done but it does assume access to a lot of equipment! All in all I am glad to have it in my collection.
1,One of the worst tools i've owned,"I purchased this tool when it was first introduced, Nice idea, compact, two batteries w/charger, laser guide, spare blades(4 if I remember correctly) and of course the Kawasaki name, however, within months I literally threw the saw, batteries and charger in the garbage. First off the Laser guide required a seperate battery, not a large problem but a bit of nuisance, after all if you make a battery powered saw why not operate the laser off the main battery? the main problem, However was that the saw batteries simply would not hold a charge, by the third recharge I was lucky to have enough power to cut a single one by board. Both batteries were sub-standard, the tool was useless, If this was Kawasaki's initial entry into the cordless tool market I suggest they go back to the drawing board and come up with a decent Battery."
5,Just as pictured,I purchased several of these wall plates in various sizes to restyle the outlets in my kitchen. They all have exactly the same nickel finish and look great. Even with the white recepticals and switches they blend very well. Best prices I found. Would highly recommend.
1,Poor,"As of 2011, this book contains much outdated information and numerous claims which were incorrect even at the time of publishing. The writing style is horrendous - the author has gone out of their way to use needlessly decorated language which results in a barrage of rhetoric and hand-waving fluff - valueless page filler that reminds of college papers that needed 500 more words to achieve the word limit.When I read the sentence 'You have the talent and opportunity to apply the intelligence of Einstein and the imagination of Picasso' I cringed. Who but the most susceptible and naive first year marketing student can read those words and feel anything but pity for the author.If you already own this book, my suggested use is either a door stop or fuel for the fire. If you don't own this book, win!"
3,Nothing practical and nothing you don't know,"A book with a tittle ""Marketing genius"" creates high expectations. Even higher expectations are created in the foreword, when author claims that this book will awaken a marketing genius inside you.Sadly, it ain't true. This book is just a compilation of the success stories everyone in the marketing knows by heart: Starbucks, Nike, Apple, you name it. These stories are followed up by such ""inspiring"" phrases ""be creative"", ""look at what Apple does"" and so on. In authors mind, as I understand, these two things should work and bring a marketing genius out of you. I really would like to hear at least one testimonial it did.To sum it up you can read it if you're a starter in marketing or just want to know more about it. But if it's pat of your job - don't waste your time: this book cannot offer you anything you don't know."
3,The glossy under the marketing texts,"Maybe Peter Fisk simply had the bad fortune I read his book along Jim Stengel's Grow. Or maybe it is just that i'm too much of an action oriented person.Fisk's book is full of lists, full of people who have done great things. It's not a receipebook, nor does it intent to be that. Yet it sometimes suggests that if you want to become a marketing genius, this is the book to read.Maybe it's the whole concept, the Rambo approach to doing things: there is one man that can do it all, alone. The genius who can fix it: the Von Neumann, the Turing. But is that what you need in a people's business? Wouldn't you rather have a people person? Someone who listens, who is able to subsequently uses what he has heard to think into the box from the outside.Again, an OK book, yet why not ask for more than OK?"
5,Good Price Speakers Ridiculous Shipping Price,For me MTX is the best brand out there and i want to make all my system MTX but the shipping prices for these speakers is ridiculous two of the sellers charge 600+ and one charges 1000+ its like if your shipping a car or something all that just for two damn speakers man with that money you can buy all the system and not just two speaker that are going to be used for voice.
4,Very good,Just what I was expecting. Good product. So pleasing to find something NOT made in China these days.
5,Simple story with beautiful illustrations and great pop-ups.,"Morris the Mouse is looking for a new home, but each place he looks is already inhabited. He ends up happy at his old nest. This is a simple story which can be enjoyed by very young children. The illustrations are very well done - the colors are clear and bright, with small details such as butterflies or moths included on each page.What really makes this book special, though, are the pop-ups. Each one is activated by opening a simple flap, but different motions occur which complement the illustration: a wren flaps its wing, a squirrel flicks its tail, a dormouse peeks out of a bush. The flaps themselves are well designed for little hands, as there are no pull tabs. The last page of the book is a full 2-page pop-up, which is activated simply by turning the page, and which moves nicely as the pages are flexed slightly.My 21-month-old likes this book so much that I'm considering buying another one in the series."
4,"Women's Rahina Embellished Sandal, White, 7 M","It's a beautiful sandal. It's kind of stiff, but will probablygive after being worn several times."
2,NOTE : i havent seen the movie,"if youre thinking of buying this movie and have no idea what its about ill give you bit. i saw the trailer on the Terror Firmer dvd. this movie is about a guy who gets into a car accident that ends up maiming his wife and killing his daughter. he then gets visions of his dead daughter telling him to go out and kill people. i cant really reccomend this or not, i havent seen it... but i would think any troma fan would take interest."
3,"I'm very unsatisfied about the price gap between two identical products, and lack of responses","Hi,Althought I've bought the exactly same products, the price gap between them was over 100 dollars. I don't understand hos this happens. And secondly, I'm getting frustrated about my returned item. You are not responding for such a long period of time, and there's no way to contact you guys directly.Please review over my past purchases and tell me what is going on.Thank you"
2,A Bizarre Little Film,"Homebodies is, in a word, odd. The movie is about a group of senior citizens who are losing their apartment building to a developer who wants to turn the area into a high-end residential area. The seniors decide to fight back and sabotage the construction, becoming more violent as the movie progresses.The movie is often considered part of the horror genre, but a certain amount of humor leads me to place it into more of a black-comedy area. It's amusing, decently acted, and a bit disturbing, especially the dark ending."
5,Just like in Japan!,"After being an exchange student in Japan, I found myself longing for the foods my host mom made, and decided to try cooking them myself! (Despite my absolute inability to cook previous to this.) This book provides recipies that taste exactly like the foods that could be found both at my host mom's table and at Japanese restaurants. They're easy to follow, include lots of photos to illustrate each step, and allow for improvisation for ingredients that are sometimes hard to find. I recommend Quick and Easy Japanese Cuisine highly for those looking to start (or continue) a cullinary adventure!"
4,A good book to quick start yourself into Java programming,This book has a good mix of both in-depth information and handy references that call out specific points of interest. This allows one to skim easily and then focus in on areas of interest.
5,VERY VERY good,"This is such a beautiful little story. My lil'one has made me read this book so many times, and now, knows it by heart, and tells the story with expressions and emotions. After reading the book my lil'one insisted on getting a hat for the birthday. A beautiful book and strongly recommend for any kid 15 months and over. Don't forget to check out the youtube video with the same title."
4,One thing that went wrong,"(on behalf of my 6 year old son). I like this book because nothing went wrong except one thing, and it was when bear said, ""Hello"" but it echoed. I recommend this book because it is a pretty good beginner book."
3,Cute story but...,Very cute story (mom's opinion) but only asked to read one time. Child four year old boy.
2,Please don't make me read it again!,"I have a two year old son who is obsessed with the moon, so I figured this book would be right up his alley. I was right. He loves this book and wants it read over and over. The problem is that the book is horrible from an adult perspective. It's the story of a bear who thinks he's talking to the moon, but actually it's just his own voice echoing back to him. It's the same lines being repeated over and over and over again. I'm glad my son loves the book, but anyone who reads this book to him ends up making up their own story-maybe that's why he likes it so much? Cute book, but as a parent it's a very annoying book to read every night."
5,Great book,"Great gift for a 5 year old. My niece loves this book, she just laughs and laughs when she reads it. It made a great b-day gift. Shipped and packaged perfectly by Amazon."
5,Best Christmas Gift,"I got this for my 18 yr old sister. She hadn't seen a copy of the book since she was 10, and it was her favorite book growing up. She cried when she opened it. I think she liked it! I recommend this book for any child, of any age. It's a cute classic."
5,Happy Birthday Moon,"This is a classic yet simple tale of a sweet little chocolate colored bear who cannot understand that his echo is not really the moon speaking back to him. A cute book I think children aged 5 and under will enjoy for its simplicity and big, boldly colored illustrations."
5,clear audio inside and outside,"Fisher monitor works like a charm, clear audio anywhere inside and while I work outside the house doing chores."
2,Battery Hog and Doesn't always turn off,"Overall, this monitor works, has good distance, etc. But it has a couple of real annoying issues. First it consumes batteries (3 AAA) as fast as my daughter consumes bottles. Generally about every 2-3 days it needs new batteries - and that's with having it plugged in most of the time. And because the battery cover is a screw, it's not easy to change. Secondly, the low battery monitor continues to go off even when the unit is turned off. So the only way to get it to stop is to remove the batteries.I would look at another product instead."
4,Long distance baby monitor,I live in a NYC apartment and have two kids under the age of 2. I have tried the Sony and the Graco monitors. This Fisher Price long distance has been great - however my only complaint is that you need to turn the volume down a bit as it does give off background noise or a hum. But when my son cries I can hear him loud and clear. Other than that it works much much better than the Graco. My daughter is just in the next room and the Graco still starts beeping in the middle of the night for no reason! The Song is not a bad monitor either.
5,Great motivator,Jim Rohn is an excellent motivator. I was waiting intensely for every word. This was referred to me by one of my team members and she was right.
5,WOW...WOW..WOW...!!,"Mr. Jim Rohn is an AWESOME speaker in terms of building your network marketing business. I say this CD will work for anyone who will take these principles he has shared and ACTUALLY apply them to your efforts of building your business. Whether part-time like myself or full-time like others in the industry, this CD will work if you just listen and apply along with your belief system. I have found the key to building your network marketing business is simply the way you think!!!"
3,Not in denial as much as before...,"I give the brotha credit for at least putting a label on himself. In the introduction, he says ""I am a bisexual man."" That's pretty much would've saved Oprah about half an hour of dialog from his appearance on the show. I mean the man went on and on about how he's living the straight life, but has sex with men and didn't consider himself gay or bisexual. For some DL brothas, ""It was the liquor."" Personally, I don't think there's enough alcohol on this planet to make me even consider...I can't even type it out.Anyway, back to this book - I think it's a decent follow-up, but not worth purchasing. There was an, er, interesting story on how he was on a date dancing with a beautiful sister and this, er, well, in his words, ""fine brother,"" walked in and how they were both checking him out and laughing about it. See? Honest Love. Check it out at the local library, if you're interested in his life after the down low."
1,phoney,This book continues to give dl men excuses to be selfish and think of themselves only king encourages honesty but still tells men its ok to lie to thier families and spouses not a good read
5,A Book To Keep,Six Questions is a MUST READ for every one who wants to live a happy life. Dr. Nowinski's approach in finding one's life vision is very practical and effective.The 6 questions are simple but most revealing if we care to take the time to answer them properly. The real life stories in the book clearly demonstrate how the process have helped some people in finding their truest life.The 6 questions have certainly challenged me to revisit many of my current thinking. I would highly recommend the book to people searching for a meaningful life. It is also a book that we should revisit when things are not happening the way we expect them to be.It is truely a book to have and to hold.
2,Doesn't follow through with what it states,"I bought this book, but returned it. The excerpt says that this book will help you plan your life forward. This book is like a myriad of books that have you look back in your life to find clues to move forward. I think most people are already aware of what they enjoyed as a child. This approach may work for some, but I think most will find no new insights. If you do what you always have done in the past, you will lead yourself to where you are now. No new visions here just a new angle of hype!"
3,Smaller than expected,Quantity: The amount of food in this meal was very small. It was not worth the price I paid in money to buy it nor the amount of energy spent hauling it to the mountain top for breakfast.Quality: Over powering blueberry taste.
4,Mmmmm....blueberry,Great for backpacking. A little complicated to prepare - especially in the dark next to the camp fire. Taste great. Nice treat while out in the sticks.
3,Decent player with limitations,"I made several VCD's from my camcorder and when played on this JVC unit, it starts off well, then about 2 minutes into the video, it goes into a slow motion and becomes unwatchable. The exact same thing has happened on ALL my VCD productions. I have an older Pioneer player and it plays my VCDs perfectly. The only reason I'm still keeping it is because it's slim design fits perfectly in my A/V rack."
4,4+ actually,"This is one great DVD player. But it is more than a DVD player. As its promotional literature notes, it plays audio CDs, VCDs, MP3 encoded audio disks, CD-Rs, and CD-RWs. But, contrary to what the manual states, it also plays DVD-Rs recording on Apple's iDVD software. (Gotta get a new iMac if you really are interested in making your own DVDs.) The picture is splendid, you get easy, full access to all the hot CD features, plus of bunch of other digital goodies. Indeed, the picture quality is superior to Toshiba, Sony, Panasonic, and Pioneer. I purchased mine for just under $200, and consider an amazing bargain."
2,Pocket Dividers,The delivery time was good and they were in good condition but they didn't last very long. They ripped out of my son's binder not even 3 months into school.
2,Not so helpful,"The examples are too simple and basic. It tries to cover all kinds of positions, so there is no focus. You can get the ideas from any resume books from the city libraries. This book might be useful for instructors."
2,MIS-Represented- BEWARE- Read closely,"AMAZON is doing a poor service to their loyal computer parts buyers on this item. One is by showing a SINGLE ram stick Pictured, when it is actually 2, and the other is by NOT putting anywhere in the item description that this is NOT a Single 2gb stick of ram(1 stick shown as item picture), but actually 2 pcs of 1gb each in package. The only tiny clue in the item description that most average buyers would not catch is the word ""KIT"" in part number description, which commonly refers to DUAL CHANNEL KIT, but nowhere is this stated. I bought this item expecting a single 2gb stick, and would not recommend or buy again."
1,"Broken upon arrival, no replacement available","This item had a broken LCD date viewer, which made it impossible to perform the initial setup. Amazon was great about handling the return, but had no other matches to replace it with. I got my money back at least."
3,"Decent watch, but the technology is still immature","This watch is a little large, but it is light and attractive. The automatic time setting works, but the watch has to be sitting next to a window. The process takes a few minutes, and you can't move the watch during that time. It can be done automatically at night, or manually whenever you want. I can get a good signal by our bedroom window.Seeing the hands move automatically to another time is a nifty gimmick, but apart from that, it is a very minimalistic watch. The manual is tiny and thick, but you can download it from the Casio web site and print on normal sized pages.I paid $55, which I think is a fair price, but if I had to do it again, I'd probably buy a small cheap digital watch. The automatic timesetting just isn't there yet."
4,Casio Wavereceptor Atomic,Great price and quality. Not a dress watch but an excellent watch for outdoor activities
4,"Casio, a name you can trust...","I was looking for a casual inexpensive watch and this one is an excellent choice. The only downside is that sometimes the waveceptor signals can not reach the atomic clock in order update the time(due to cloudy weather). The watch automatically updates the time 5 times through the night when signals are the strongest. If you want a simple, casual, and very accurate watch choose this one. Comes in brown also."
2,CHEAP!,"This thing is very cheaply made, It won't fit forest river campers. Wish I never bought it, threw it out with installing. Its that bad.-James"
2,You pay for what you get.,"Did not fit and the pre-drilled holes were all in the wrong place. I installed it on a temporary basis, till I can order something else. It's not worth much more than the $10.00."
2,No power cord received,"Did I miss something here? There was no mention that you had to buy a powercord and wire it into the unit yourself. Came with a couple small batteries, not sure what for. Returned for refund."
4,Interesting blend of faerie history and fantasy,"Imagine blending the most interesting elements of ""Poltergeist"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Exorcist"", and ""Wizard of Oz"" into a book, and you got Feist's 'Faerie Tale'. I've been a fan of fantasy for a long time, but this book is quite unique, and psycholgically sharp. It's also quite haunting at times, giving you the creeps if you're reading alone at home at night. Too bad there is no really memorable character, human or supernatural."
5,So very good,"I have read this book multiple times and it scares and thrills me every single time! It isn't easy to find books that will always do that. If you are looking for a fairy tale for grownups, you need look no further. You have found it!"
2,One of two Feists that I cannot recommend,"Merchant Prince was un-fun, but this one is just unpleasant. I have a great deal of difficulty with evil preying on innocence, especially when the innocents are children. Ugh!"
1,One of the worst I've ever read!!!!!!!!!,"I have read almost all of raymonds books, and I have enjoyed reading all of them. however, this book is another story. The plot and the story was ok, but it was extremly slow. I could usually stay up all night reading a good book, but I had trouble reading for more than 30 minuts at a time."
5,Fantastic book haven't found another like it,"I read this book quit some time ago and have tried to find another with a simular story line and have not. I wish Fiest would write another like it,but a may be hard to duplicate this book, it was great."
4,Great but superficially flawed story,"I thouroughly enjoyed this title, and the author's attention to detail is wonderful. However, I felt some of the nearly pornographic sequences could have been toned down. I know it's a matter of taste, but eroticism doesn't have to be so blunt. A more subtle approach would seem a more appropriate for ethereal creatures such as fairies. As well, there are times when the writing makes no sense, and I was forced to read over particular segments many times before understanding their content. Complaints aside however, it is a very interesting tale, and I thoroughly recommend it."
2,I was very disappointed; Mr. Feist can and has done better.,"I'm a fan of Mr. Feist's Riftworld saga, so I started reading this book with high expectations. I couldn't even finish it. The violence, etc., was just too graphic. If you're a fan of horror or *really* dark fantasy (which I'm not) you might enjoy this. However, if you're reading this because you're a fan of Riftworld and expecting more of the same-- Don't."
5,A masterfully written spiritual guide.,"Written in a very simple, easy to follow, down-to-earth style, Dr. Prieskorn has given us an easy to follow guide to finding one's purpose in life. He masterfully shares with his readers his own spiritual quest and search for self. During that process Dr. Prieskorn takes us by the hand and leads us through the maze we call life using simple self-discovery exercises that anyone can follow.I highly recommend Healing Journey: Seven Steps to Inner Healing Power."
3,Beginning the excavation,"3 1/2It would still take Evan's a few more albums to master the monstrous melodics he became immortalized for, but this popular sophomore release already displayed a masterful grip around melancholic balladry."
5,"Hate the Title, love the album","Always hated the title of this album, but it really is the gold standard for piano jazz in that period. Just relistened to it, and marvelled all over again. Perhaps ""Some Other Time"" is the best cut. The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans sessions complement this album perfectly."
5,Raw Nerve!,"Ok im giving this movie 5 Stars because it had an Awesome Truck Crash torwards the End of the movie were a Chevy Pickup Truck goes over a Parking Garage and Slams down on the Ground and It is Awesome.As for the Movie itself it is alright its about a Serial Killer Killing People and its got Some Action in it to But overall it is Good only because of the Truck Crash Scene if you like Crashes You,ll like this Movie."
2,credit this review to Josh Pasnak of Canada,"Jimmy Clayton is a race car driver who has visions of the murders that have been happening locally. The police do not believe him and he is not aware of what is happening to him. When he has a vision of his sister Gina being murdered, he needs to make an investigation of his own. With the help of local reporter Gloria Freedman, Jimmy tries to determine who the murderer is and analyse his visions.I add that the two compelling reasons for any interest in this flick is that it is one of the last screen appearances of the LEGENDARY Glenn Ford, and secondly, contains one hot Traci Lords."
4,Great addition to night running safety,"If you're going to run at night in an area with automotive traffic, this vest can help to keep you safe. The difference between running with and without this vest is night and day. The flashing LEDs and the reflective strips alert cars to your presence and they treat you with a bit more respect. The vest fits a wide variety of sizes. Build quality isn't great; the on/off button can be hard to use and a few LEDs might not work. But overall a good product for runners, bicyclists, walkers, or anyone else who needs to be seen at night."
1,"Seemed perfect, came broken","This seemed like just the product I needed in order to feel safer during my bike rides at night in the streets of Sao Paulo. However, the quality leaves a lot to be desired and it came without the on-off switch. Needless to say I sent it back and did not risk buying a new one."
1,didn't work and torn,"I purchased 2 vest and both had problems from the start. Couldn't even use them at the time I needed to. One had a hole in the pocket so the battery pack broke away from the vest. The other just never lit, so I checked the wiring and there was a break just after the first led.Now they sit doing nothing. Waisted money!"
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this vest for a night relay - hoping it would fulfill requirements for safety lights front and back, with the ease of a vest. This vest is HUGE, but more important, it did not work. We tried everything, but could not get the lights to come on. Would not recommend this vest."
4,Works Great,I had one of these and they lasted almost a year before the lights didn't work. I bought this new one about 2 months ago. Despite the claim the red lights only flash which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I use this when I walk the dogs at night. The red flashing lights definitely get the attention of the drivers in the neighborhood.
1,Crappy quality,"I used this for one winter season for running, within 6 months the reflective bits started cracking and flaking off. Also the pouch that held the battery pack tore off from the vest during one run.The quality is just laughable."
1,cheep not worth it.,"The saying goes you get what you pay for. This vest just a basic vest, LED's are basic not bright enough to make any difference at a distance. I found a real safety vest at safetyyousee.com with real bright LED's but the cost isnt for the basic cheep vest."
2,"Don't judge a ""book"" by it's cover!","Looks good, but not great quality. Vest is very visible during daytime (used for bicycling). Would be especially visible at night, if LED lights worked properly (ordered 2, both malfunctioned). Lightweight and mesh (so not warm). Only size is XL. Very adjustable at waist (3 places to adjust velcro), but unless you have large shoulders/upper body, very loose upper body fit with no adjustment available (so fits larger persons, but not smaller or kids)."
4,"Great, but needs better velcro","This is an excellent vest. I'm sure if I were a construction worker, it would be even better. As a cyclist, however, I find that the velcro on the front of the vest constantly falls loose. I sewed on some better velcro, and it works like a charm!"
3,pity about the LED lights,"The product was very effective at first, making me feel safe when running in the early morning darkness. Unfortunately, the LED lights stopped working this morning. Has anyone else had this problem?"
2,wiring is faulty,The LEDs don't work most of the time because the wiring is faulty. Might as well get one without the LEDs.
1,Only one flash setting - detail description completely wrong,"Despite its description, the vest either flashes or is off. Flashing lights are illegal for non-emergency use. This vest is completely useless to me as a motorcycle rider, and I will be sending it back."
2,Don't waste your money,"The lights on the vest only worked 3 or 4 times before they started working only occasionally and now not at all. As noted by other reviewers, the wiring and battery case are cheaply made and don't hold up. I was using the vest while bike commuting to work. Not worth the money or the time."
4,great watch for the price,"Very nice watch. If the band is leather, it would be much better. I'm willing to pay more to get the same one with leather band."
3,Well worth the price!!!,"I own a dozen watches and I really like this Casio for swiming and sports, it's a bit dim in the dark but it feels very light on the wrist and it tells the exact time always so if you like to swim this is the watch to get."
5,an excellent collection of a communities favorite recipes,"Since life (in rural Vermont anyway) seems to revolve around seasonal events, this cookbook was perfectly arranged for me. The recipes are grouped by month with each month represented by a type of food. For instance July is berries, August is the garden harvest, November is apples and pumpkins. This makes finding an appropriate recipe easy. A must try recipe is the Applesauce Raisin Cake. It is truly delicious! From the lovely cover, the interesting photographs of Ashfield MA, the weather statistics, the tidbits of information about the town, to the terrific down-home recipes, this book is a wonderful addition to my cookbook collection."
4,Boxed Set bought as a gift,I bought this for a gift. I did not actually open or view the DVDS but I thought that the boxed set was reasonably priced for the number of shows purchased and it was nice to purchase all of them at once instead of buying each season individually.
4,Thanks amazon,"I ordered this product for Christmas. All 11 seasons were shrink wrapped together and each individual season was shrink wrapped except season 1. It was obvious season 1 was a used dvd and disc 4 was missing. Thanks amazon for sending me a used product with a disc missing when I purchased a new item. In requesting a return of this product, I e-mailed amazon asking if I was to send back just season 1 or the entire purchase. That was a week ago and as of yet I have not heard from amazon."
2,cheers,There's no subtitle information regarding DVD products. And many TVs sold outside US are without closed caption function. That makes the DVD I purchased kind of useless.
1,Terrible Piece of Junk,"I had this player for a week and had to return it. The picture would fade from real bright to real dark every 3 seconds or so. Same result on different DVD's. When I returned it, the clerk said that a bunch had been returned, and, ""It's really not a very good brand."" I highly advise you to try another brand."
2,My Oritron had problems!,"Got this through Target.com. One side of the box had a dent in it, so I assume it got dropped, which may account for the weird video...it keeps flickering in and out, getting darker and redder, and then coming in light and bright at regular intervals. Totally unwatchable. It didn't with an old DVD called Slipstream, but it has with the Gladiator, the Fugitive, Romeo Must Die, etc. According to one reviewer, his didn't work hooked up through a VCR, so I will try to just hook it up to the TV before I try to return it. Will trade it in and see if the new one works before taking it home! I tried it hooked up to 2 different tv's."
3,Nice inexpensive DVD player,"My first experience with this player was very positive. That is until I inserted the second DVD, which happened to be Disney's Dinosaur which I purchased at the same time as the player. For some reason this completely locks up the player. It is quite a trick to figure out to even eject the CD, which requires unplugging the unit, re-powering, and hitting the eject before it locks up again! All of my other DVDs work fine in it, but I think it will have to go back to the store to be exchanged for one that can play Dinosaur. The Dinosaur DVD works fine in the Toshiba DVD in my PC."
4,A good player with 1 bug...,"I received the DVD600 player for Christmas and have no problems. It has a crystal clear picture and good sound. It has played every DVD we bought or rented. My only complaint is the inability of this player to convert anamorphic widescreen to my 31"" TV. Other than that, this player will work nicely until we upgrade to a higher quality player in a few years. I recommend this player to someone buying one for the first time or to someone who does not have the money for a big brand name player."
2,Problem with Disney DVD's,"Our oritron will not play Disney Dinosaur DVD. We haven't tried any other Disney DVD's, however we've played other DVD's with no problem. We noticed another review indicating the same problem with the same DVD. We purchased two new Dinosaur DVD's and the response is the same. Does anyone have a solution? Please respond to HalBaker@aol.com Thanks"
1,Not the best unit in the world,"This is by far one of the worst DVD players I've had the misfortune to own. Although it is a 5-disc player, it does not have continuous play - therefore one must press play to move on to the next CD. The player responds very slowly to each command - for example it takes approximately 30-45 secs after pressing the open/close button for the unit to open, or after pressing the menu button for you to be able to select a menu option. The only good thing I'd say is that the sound - once the unit plays (and it is temperamental, is quite good. Frankly, the only reason I haven't returned this player is because I can't find the receipt!"
1,Horrible DVD Quality / Riddled with problems,"I have had this dvd player for approximately 2 years and have had nothing but trouble. First of all, it doesn't effectively play mp3 cd's. Secondly, a few months ago, my sound quit working right through my receiver, you couldn't hear any voices (although you could hear the background music way too well). Then, my video wasn't working and all I got was black and white video, but then the sound worked fine. Now, neither sound nor video work. Ok, so I got this wonderful idea to call Tech Support. All the guy there did was repeat the same 5-step routine with me for 20 minutes. By the way, tech support is really located in Hong Kong (Oritron is not a US brand). Overall, I would not recommend this dvd player to anyone."
2,It's good for some bad for others,This DVD player is a good one for people that want no extras. Just put the disk in and play for a normal exceptional movie experience. But if you want the high quality great DVD watching this is not for you. Personally my system has the sound feed faster than the video feed. I don't know if it's just the system or my surround system. Personally this DVD is not worth more than about [money]. With today's market for DVD players it's just not worth [money]. You can get a good JVC or Toshiba for around [money].
1,Not so great first DVD player,"I bought this DVD player for my parents. We set it up in about 5 minutes, through their VCR, and it worked great. My folks had no trouble using the remote or navigating through the menus. The picture and sound were fine, and we played several movies with no problems. It's not a fancy model, but it does the basic job of showing movies-which is what I bought it for. I would recommend it as a first DVD player.Update: One year later- this DVD player had broken and they replaced it with a more expensive brand name. I would not recommend this DVD player anymore."
1,JUST SAY NO,This unit is missing even some of the most basic functions for a DVD. For $100.00 more I was able to get a DVD with Dolby digital.My unit only played 6 hours before it started flinging the disk inside. It was shipped by Amazon with no packing around it--I'm sure that contributed to the poor condition of this machine.
1,remote stinks,I have owned my dvd for 1 year.And in that time I have only used it a few times.It is not worth the aggravation.The remote does not work the player.I put in fresh batteries and it will work a couple of times.but if you want to see deleted scenes or bonus material forget it.It will only work for part of the time and then you have to do it at the unit.But all the buttons needed to work it are not on the player.So you my friends are sol.
1,don't buy a dvd 600 from curry's,we bought a oritron 600 12/00..went wrong .sound jumps..skips chapters...sound out of sync with mouth movement.....returned product to curry's who upgraded software..guess what still does it and oritron and curry's no help at alldon't do it
1,Don't buy this!,"I would like to save you from the embarrassment of giving this DVD player to anyone and then finding out that it broke only 6 months later. The act that caused the break down was moving the player from one room to another. Before it broke all together, it skipped, froze, wouldn't eject, didn't respond to remote comands, or did so very slowly. Get a name brand you have heard of; the difference in customer support is worth every penny extra you may pay for it. I have purchased a JVC, a Samsung and a Panasonic DVD player, each for under $150, all of which satisfactorily reached their first anniversary of purchase with ease. This Oritron player is a waste of money."
3,Problems reading Disney DVD's,"Does anyone else experience a problem reading Disney DVD's with this unit? I've run over 40 DVD's without problem, but when I tried a rented ""Dinosaur"" DVD, it failed to load, and locked up the whole unit. I tried another copy, but the same thing happened. The DVD's were rented from Blockbuster, who puts a transparent cover over the label with their name on it. Could this cause a problem? Please email me Chivalrous@mail.com if you have a comment.Other than this, the player works great, but be sure to unplug it when not in use as it tends to run hot."
4,gets the job done.,I bought this dvd player around a year ago. I have only one problem I have encountered if you are a wrestling fan you know that the dvds have extras.On one of my dvds it would not play the last two extras forsome reason other than that I believe its a good dvd player. Ive never had any problem with disc getting stuck or anything like that.Basically the two extras I just watched on my ps2.
1,This is the worst DVD player I have EVER seen!,"I watched two movies with this thing, and after that it simply refused to work. My Charlie's Angels DVD got stuck in the player and I had to get a screwdriver and pry it open. Horrible quality. Movies would play half-way through and then the picture would break up, and it would say ""disc error"". I would then play the same part perfectly on another player. There is no front display, either! Don't buy this play. If you want a good player, try the RCA RC5215P. I've had it for two months with no problems."
1,Bzzzzt!,"My first oritron died in about 4 weeks. It's replacement(via the warrenty) died in about 3 months. The firmwarealways seemed buggy even when it did work. Even though ithad some nice features, I'd prefer not to have them if Icould be assured that the product would last more than ahandful of plays!!!"
1,worst dvd player,"i have the 650, not the 600 (...)...but its the worst! the color fades in and out from normal to dark...terrible purchase - don't get it! i'm looking into other brands..."
1,Unfortunately you get what you pay for...,This is a cheap unit and it behaves that way. I've had trouble with the audio when trying to output DTS. The audio was cutting in and out frequently. The menu system is also clunky on this model. I upgraded to a Pioneer DVD-434. What a difference. It's much easier to navigate the menus and I've had no trouble with the Dolby Digital and DTS output. Spending the money for a nicer player is my suggestion to you.
1,If I could I would rate this thing.......,"Negative stars. I was able to watch MAYBE 4 movies. Now the DVD is stuck in the player. Unplug it, plug it back in, unplug it, etc. Nothing. Ordering my new one right now and gonna spend the extra hundred bucks to get a decent machine. I let my desire to have a DVD player get the best of me on this one. I normally spend the extra for a name brand. Don't make my mistake. ..."
1,Biggest piece of doo doo I ever bought,This piece of junk cost me about $[money]...It never really played well. DVD's would get stuck. You could see digital junk on the screen. I guess you get what you pay for. I highly UN-recommend it. This thing is a paper weight at the moment.
2,not so hot,"I am a diesel mechanic by trade and I work in new york and as you can assume it gets cold. I bought this heater and the fan thinking that it would do something along the lines of at least blowing hot air at me while I am sitting at my tool box working on the computer. At 2 feet away you can not tell the differance, its just cold air so I would suggest looking at getting something different."
5,One Love for reallll,This is the best movie that I have seen so far out of Jamaica. There are other Jamaican movies that I have watch and would not take a second look. With ths movie I found my self keep watching over and over again. The passion and chemistry between Kymani and Cherine was wonderful. I would love for them to do a part 2 of this movie in the future but not too far in the future.
5,Great product!!!,I love this movie! This is probably the best movie produced in Jamaica. The soundtrack is awesome and gets you into that feel good mood. ONE LOVE is the best!
2,Swashbuckling in the Rain,"MGM's strange version of the Alexandre Dumas classic remains the most miscast swashbuckler in movie history. Gene Kelly plays D'Artagnan as though he were in a musical, which isn't surprising since George Sidney directs ""The Three Musketeers"" as though it were ""Anchors Aweigh."" At least Kelly doesn't sing. This 1948 production finds plenty of actors stuck in the wrong genre: Lana Turner, Van Heflin, June Allyson, Vincent Price, Gig Young, Frank Morgan and Keenan Wynn! Only Angela Lansbury and Reginald Owen emerge unscathed. Sidney approaches the Dumas adventure with an uneasy, uncertain tone - not helped by the cheerfully garish Technicolor. Happily, the filmmaking stylist showed a remarkable resurgence in his 1952 remake of ""Scaramouche."""
3,"Enjoyable Romp, Nothing More","First, let me say, Gene Kelly cannot act. He can sing, he can dance, and even sword-fight with the best of them, but the man cannot act. That being said, there's enough sword-fighting here to almost forget that fact. That, and he shares the screen with a few enjoyable characters. The Technicolor has not held up so well and looks simultaneously overexposed and drab. I will spare you the plot overview and simply say that the whole movie is like a bite of cotton candy: it's sweet, but it's mostly air. I much prefer the wholly wonderful Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn."
3,ANOTHER MGM SCHIZOID PRODUCTION,"Previous reviews have gone on at length about the plot, and made comparisons to other productions, so I'm just adding a few thoughts.1) Yes, Gene Kelly is jaw-droppingly brilliant in his swashbuckling scenes. I don't think I've ever seen anyone top him, including Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. Unfortunately, he does have a tendency to smirk at the worst possible times, including June Bug's death scene.2) As some others have suggested, Lana Turner and Angela Lansbury shouldhave traded parts, altho Lana's fake remorse scene, done with no make-upand a modified fright wig, is better than I would have expected from TheSweater Girl.3) Did Miss Allyson have it in her contract that she would only wear costumes which included a Peter Pan collar? Her outfits are nearly asfunny as the Musketeers, almost all of which were in various shades ofpink, purple and puce. I've seen drag queens on Halloween who were lessflamboyant!4) Was Robert Coote ever THAT YOUNG??"
5,Bringing back memories,Watching this movie was very delightful. I saw this movie as a teenager in Germany (obviously in German).It was amazing to watch the energy level the actors had. Real craftsmen ship.Highly recommendable.
4,The Three Musketeers,"Great example of the ""swashbuckling"" genre...All the players are great, especially Gene Kelly...and Lana Turner is the perfect mix of beauty and poison...overall, a very good movie..."
4,Superb film,Although the film is somewhat outdated what the action scenes concern as compared to special effects used nowadays it is a superb movie. The acting is very good. The elegance and acrobacy of Gene Kelly is outstanding. A film that can stand next to recent remakes.
4,Worth watching--good clean fun,"Fun swordplay, elaborate costumes, great romance. In spite of some awkward moments, it's an enjoyable movie, and special fun for Kelly fans. Much better than some recent efforts. The recent Man in the Iron Mask, for example, can't touch it for action, especially swordplay. Kelly's D'Artagnan and Constance ""meet cute"" and he also manages some sexy moments with Lana Turner. However, I can't help picturing how great Angela Lansbury would have been as Milady de Winter. Anyone who's ever seen her as the scheming maid in Gaslight, or against Katherine Hepburn as the other woman in State of the Union, knows that she was wasted as the virtuous queen. And if Turner had played Constance, what a battle of the divas it would have been!(Picture the scenes when Buckingham makes Constance her guard.) If only the casting could have been changed... But it's a fun movie for all of that."
2,Pretty frame but not photo-friendly,I liked this frame for it's 2-photos in one feature. I want to use it on a counter. I worked with putting the photos in for an hour last night and still it's not quite right. Very hard to get them in place just right and get fasteners tight enough to hold them. They come with rubber inserts between the glass. No instructions so not sure if the inserts are to be kept or not. Would not want another one.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This charger is flimsy and broke the first time out of the box. The ""clamps"" - really more like hair clips - are light weight and sprung apart immediately - springs and pins flying everywhere. Much cheaper and easier to take the battery to Advance Auto. Don't waste your money!"
2,got the wrong item,"I thought I bought this item to charge my batteries in the car.It didn't mention that I have to physically take the batteries out to charge it.How am i going to do that? considering that I got this item to begin with so that this product claims, I can do it myself, when i don't know anything about cars."
2,Too small for large batteries,I purchased the VEC1086BBD to charge deep cycle marine batteries. Unfortunately it too small for such use and no matter how long I kept it running it never seemed to top off the batteries. I ended up exchanging it for the larger VEC1087CBD which works much better and provides more feedback.
1,Garbage,"Worked perfectly for a year or so, then died.My old (Old Fashion) battery charger, which wasn't a Black & Decker, lasted for 23 years!! Yep, it wasn't one of these new digital advanced jobs like the one above. It just charged a battery...period! Unfortunately that company is out of bussiness. Probably run out of bussiness by these new CHEAP things that just don't last.After finding out what it would cost to mail this Black & Decker back, wait, etc. It was cheaper to just buy another one.What ever one I choose, it won't be Black & Decker."
2,Updated review - doesn't work now...,"Initially, I thought this battery charger was a good value except it doesn't work after using it intermittently over several winter seasons.----------------------------------------Original review when purchased in 2007:If you're looking for an inexpensive 12V lead-acid battery charger this one works great.I use it to keep several sizes of 12V batteries charged during the off season (2 scooters & JD lawn tractor).Note: Once in a while, I get a ""fault"" reading which can be easily cleared by reconnecting the charger or by selecting the next higer amperage rating for the battery. The charger automatically drops the amperage to the lower level in a short time.Overall, it works great."
5,a really good value,"a very high tech charger includes a cooling fan to keep the electronics stable and long lasting ,well thought out and accurate charge and float rate .I am inpressed the price is worth every dollar."
5,Black and Decker Battery Charger,"This product works great, and is well worth the price. My only concern is the plastic case, will it hold up over time?"
2,Get the Battery Tender instead.,"I saw the price and decided to go with the Black and Decker instead of a Battery Tender and what a mistake. One problem is that it will not charge a completely dead battery. I had to take my lawn tractor battery out and bring it over and add some juice from my car battery before the charger would charge it. When you turn it on it sounds like it is working by the fan noise but you need to make an amperage selection manually and I am not always sure which one to select without getting the manual out. I recently used it to charge my dead car battery and it keeps giving me fault warning and not sure why. The Battery Tender is truly the best charger you can get for your vehicle because it works everytime I have used it and and is truly ""plug and Play""."
2,Light use only!,"This charger only works on very light jobs. People having success with this easy to use product tend to have batteries not needing much help to recharge their batteries. The problem comes if a battery charge is too low. This product is a great example of being too safe to actually work effectively. Go for an old school charger that will work no matter what. Use this one for light jobs only, since that is all it will work on anyways."
1,Bad out of the box.,"Purchased the vec1086 bbd charger, put it on the shelf for later use. When I needed it, plugged it in and got the ""fault"" light.It's been over a year so I now own a paperweight."
3,Usage warning,"This type of charger works just fine, but don't charge the battery in the garage if it's cold outside (unless your garage is heated.) If you attempt to charge the battery in under 40 degrees F, both the battery AND charger will fry. You'll discover the light is out on the charger, and nothing is happening, and there's no recovery at this point.Also important: Do NOT attempt to charge a ""bad"" battery. You'll know the battery is bad if while attempting to use the drill, the battery supplies NO power, you push the ""battery check"" button on the drill and NO light appears. If the battery has simply run down, at least 1 light should appear. If you DO attempt to charge a bad battery, it - too, will fry the charger. This happened to me and the only recovery was to buy a new drill, with 2 batteries & charger, which ultimately cost far less than replacing batteries and replacing the charger - and I got an 18V drill to boot."
2,Does not do as advertised.,"I bought a new battery for my lawn mower. Also bought this charger to replace a 20 year old one. Followed the instructions for charging a small lawn mower battery at the low rate setting for over 24 hours. The charger indicated that the battery was charged after that period and apparently had stopped its action. However, the battery failed to have sufficient charge level to start the mower. I had to resort to a booster to start the mower. I would use the mid level charging rate in the future."
2,could have bought this here in town for a lot less than I paid here,I could have bought this here in town for a lot less than I paid here as it was on sale. I was mad but oh well. I will look harder elsewhere.
1,poor reliability,"This is the first of two B&D; battery chargers that I have had that ceased working within two uses. While it seems decent enough at first, the single push button control doesn't provide much info when you can't get off the ""fault"" light. I have followed all of the instructions, tested the power sources, and even attempted to charge different batteries. It's just not working anymore and I couldn't have babied it more than I did.If you are looking for a product that will do what it says (and presumably that's why you bought it) every time you use it then this isn't for you. Sure, it's cute and friendly looking, but when you need a battery charged, you want it charged. This unit didn't do it for me. With the money I've invested going into my third charger/starter I could have bought a commercial unit instead that would have delivered on its promise. (sigh)"
5,As important as it is different,"Originally given as a series of invited lectures, the chapters that comprise Is There Only One True Religion or Are There Many? constitute a distinctively different and important alternative to the question of Christianity and its relationship to other religions. Rooted not at all in Ogden's metaphysics but entirely in his retrieval of, and improvement upon, the scriptural approach of Bultmann and Marxsen relative to thinking about Jesus (""christology""), Ogden's point is that revelation by a mediator is ""re-presentational"" not ""constitutive"": revelation re-presents the divine reality that cannot fail to be present, but it does not constitute a divine reality not otherwise present. For comparative religions this approach means that a given mediator can re-present the divine reality but whether it does or not cannot be predetermined."
3,"Too much gimmick, too little plot.","Sometimes one plus one does't add up to two. When twins write a mystery about twin sleuths and twin killers, it doesn't really compute. My problem with the book is that it alternates from one twin's life and thoughts to the other. It is not confusing, but seems to rely too much on this gimmick and not enough good story telling."
4,Not exactly what I wanted but did the trick,the touch switch on my favorite lamp failed. The only way I could figure to turn it on and off was to add a cord with a switch. This item is actually a plug with a switch. But it turns off my lamp!
4,Overall a pretty good book,"Overall I feel this is a very good book. I disagree with the many negative reviews I read. I especially love the introduction as well as the beginning of the first chapter, which gives an overview of the type of visualization needed to achieve your goals while spell casting. Also, she has included appendixes in the back of the book that give more detailed information on moon phases, planets, and color correspondences, so you know the best time to perform various spells. And Silver RavenWolf does make it quite clear that the wiccan rede is against manipulating the free will of others, contrary to what some other reviews may have you believe. This book is written for both beginners and avid practioners of the craft. I would definatley reccomend this book."
4,OK,It's ok. Not everything but a good book anyway. More fir enjoyment than good knowledge. I liked it just fine.
1,Just when you thought it couldn't possibly get any worse!,"I had the unfortunate horror of being subjugated to yet another trite work of drivel from the ""author"" Silver Ravenwolf.The ""spells"" had such an appearance of being ""whipped up on the spot"", or things $ilver felt didn't make the cut in her other books, that I couldn't help but laugh hysterically at her spells... and anyone who could take this travesty of a book seriously.If they offered zero stars, I would have given it. One star is really too kind. Save the money for books outside the Ravenwolf cash machine."
4,Cute for Beginners,This book is a cute little spell book for beginners or a travel book for itermediate . Its a great little book check it out .
1,Excuse me while I lose my lunch...,"If you have any sense of ethics, please don't buy this book.$RW keeps whipping them out-- nevemind about ethics, accountability, responsibility....Most Wiccans do NOT give out love spells... Most of us don't give out spells at all, or at least we can be sure that the recipient has a solid grasp of what they are getting into.This book disgusts me, as do all of her cute little ""spell books"""
3,Kinda thin sounding,"This is the perfect speaker if you are looking for warm vintage sounding with TONS of mid range. DO NOT expect too much bass freq from this one nor spiky highs. This did not convince me for my Fender 70s Princeton amp but will probably use it if i need to record something sort of old, vintage and slightly colored in that way."
2,Beautifully written but couldn't get into it,There is beautifully written by an author that obviously has a love of language. I did however struggle to get into the book and ended up abandoning it half way through.
3,Interesting..,"An interesting prodding of Achilles'character. His character, personality etc. Recommended for anyone who likes this ancient character. Forgot to mention name in above post-sorry!"
4,Lots 'O Sprouts,"This is a good value for the money. I was falsely under the impression that the seeds came in a jar rather than a sealed plastic bag. It wasn't a problem as I had a plastic jar I was able to transfer them to.The seeds sprout quickly, especially if kept either covered or in a dark space for the first 2-3 days. There is a bit of unsprouted seeds in each ""batch"" but I imagine that happens with all seeds, no matter the product. I am quite pleased with the sprouts that I have been able to produce, and my technique has been perfected.I would recommend this seller and the Handy Pantry Brand of seeds to anyone wishing to grow their own."
5,Excellent Sprouts!,"I've ordered one of these and I'm ordering another. These seeds sprout well and I'm quite happy with the taste, as well. The company got them to me in a somewhat timely fashion. I'm very satisfied with this crisp, flavorless treat. I'm sure you will like it too."
5,Busy Boats = Awesome book!,"Everything about these books is great. This was the second one was bought (we now have 3) and even my husband likes reading them to our kids! The rhymes are smart, informative, easy, and the kids love the pictures. There are also things you can pick out in the pictures which help you drag out the 'story' and give more info. Love love this series."
1,Bad shipping time,Today is january's 29 th. I ordered book one month ago. I never receive yet. Time estimate was 15 - 17 th january. What happens ?tksAZ
3,No-Drip?,It took a little while for my rabbit to learn how to use this. He has to use more of a biting action than licking. The usual water release is a ball that the animal has to lick to release water but this bottle ends with a thin metal rod that my rabbit had to bite.The great thing about this is that the bottle is really easy to clean and stores a lot of water but after about 6 months it suddenly started dripping and I couldn't get it to stop. Now I'm searching for a new bottle. Maybe the key is to just buy a new one when the old fails. It sure was easy to clean though.
4,Seems fine to me,My dachshund wasn't quite bright enough to figure out how to use this thing. We tried for a few weeks and never had a problem with leaks or anything. Unfortunately we ended up having to buy a hanging bowl instead for his crate. I would say though that it doesn't seem like much water comes out per lick when we were playing around with it.
4,guinea pigs,"Most guinea pigs will likely be use to bottles than bowls, especially the ones with a ball. It'll take a bit of toying for the animal to find out how to drink from it. These leak very little if at all. They're a good size for guinea pigs since the bottles should be frequently cleaned and filled with fresh water. Having a couple of these is better than one larger sized because there will be a bottle available for drinking when one is in use. They don't drink a ton in a day anyway."
5,Excellent book!,"I have re-read this book several times, and I enjoy it more every time!.. I only wish Ms. Fitzgerald had written another book, as I have only found this one by her!.. For those who have enjoyed this book, I also recommend 'Tradewinds' by M.M.Kaye"
5,I love this DVD set,"I have been searching and searching to find a Qi Gong system that resonates and I have finally found it here. These DVDs are a first class production all the way through.Pedram guides you without complicating, the result is a smooth enjoyable practice. I can feel my body tingling with vitality after I finish my session. I highly recommend this DVD set for anyone who is sick and tired of being sick and tired, I also recommend them for the healthy folks who want to take there energetic signature to the next level."
3,mini orchard,my granddaughter is 4 years old- she plays the game with 2 adults. She likes to build the game board & put the fruit on the trees.She only plays the game once. I think it is not challenging enough or just not holding her attention.
2,AVAST ME LUBBERS FOR SOME BLOOD AND WINE,This weird and wacky combination of THE SHINING meets DAS BOOT featuresa rusted old Nazi torture vessel that goes around sinking luxury liners and then picking up the survivors to kill them and live off their life force.Has some rotting corpses on deck and blood but few kills and a cast better suited for Love Boat then Death Ship...Still not awful and much better thenGhost Ship 1 and half stars.~~~BLOOD~~~BOTH EXCITING AND NEW~~~~COME ABOARD~~~THEY WILL BE HACKING YOU~~~~~~~~~~THE DEEEEAAATH SHIIP~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1,It was better when I was 12,Time hasn't been kind to this sad sack tale of shipwreck survivors finding a boat floating near them. The boat is the title vessel and the Nazis used it as a torcher ship. Silly plot and poor execution rob what little spark it might have had. Really poor all around
5,A Great CD!,Very beautiful music! You won't be disappointed. I was lucky I found this CD here on Amazon at a great price.
1,don't buy!!!!,"I know this just a whisk broom, but what a piece of crap. It is nothing like the picture. Very poor quality, the handle is roughly cut off without the nice chrome hanging cap. The corn is also thin and poor quality. I wouldn't waste your money on this product!"
3,Whisk,"Quality not first class. Would pay more for better product- more, tighter bristles. Don't feel this will last too long."
2,Here is my personal experience,I bought this air purifiier and started using it in the basement. Two days later the basement had a very musty smell. The basement normally has very little odor. I had the purifiier set on medium. It is a good looking machine and with wheels is easy to move around.I cannot recommend it as my basement smelled a lot worse two days later. This may have been becuase it helped to moisten the place. I also bougth the model for chemically sensitive people which has potasium iodide so I do not know if that contributed. I know that consumersearch.com and us consumer reports are the best places to get info. This product is not rated high by either. I recommend the whilpool model which is quieter and very highly recommended. Good luck!
4,Great knob for the job,"I had to look quite a while to find this particular knob. I had changed my master bath to have all brushed nickel fixtures and hardware. The new vanity has 5 small faced drawers. Everything I was able to find in my local hardware stores were larger and out of scale for the vanity. Very pleased with the ""right sizing"" and quality of this knob."
4,A Never-to-Be-Reconciled Fact of Life,"This is an unusual book because its faults are not that of the author, but that of American culture. A very detailed and informative history of death care in our society is laid out here, but the reading becomes repetitive and boring due to the fact that, as mortal beings, we cannot come to resolve issues about death. Topics such as embalming, the moral character of funeral directors, the viewing of the body, and the role of religion seem to be things that throughout the decades we are always circling around but never really confronting. Therefore, the same debates keep coming up on the same subjects. The most important point I take from this book is that we will never come to terms with death, but will always be psychologically held prisoners by the thought of it."
4,"Ol√©, Boll√©","As a nationally ranked tennis player living in Florida and playing in the senior divisions, I only wear these glasses. I use the charcoal tinted lenses when the sun is really bad and the green tinted lenses for overcast or low-light conditions. The nose and brow ridge protectors keep the sweat off the lenses, but these protectors eventually disintegrate from the perspiration in about 6 months. I still use the glasses, which are extremely tough, but I have to wipe off sweat and fogging periodically depending on the conditions. The disintegration phenomenon is universal."
4,As advertised,"Arrived in good shape, Good value I buy all my Coax Extension Cables from amazon, Wilson Electronics makes great products, never had a lemon.Read the descriptions! And you will get what you order."
4,Beautiful shoe!,"I had read that this shoe runs small in other reviews, so I originally ordered a half size larger than I normally wear. But I found they were too big, so I ordered my normal shoe size and they fit beautifully! These are the highest heels I have worn (normally I wear 2.5 to 3.5-inch heel). They take a bit of getting used to and I wouldn't want to walk a long distance in them, but they look fabulous and sexy!"
2,[bad] attempt at Southern Gothic Horror,"I think this was the last of the ""has-been actress"" horror filmsOr maybe that honor goes to ""What's The Matter With Helen"".Warning:SpoilersI remember watching this movie on TV when I was a kid. Then a couple of years ago I rented the video and couldn't believe how gory it was. Even though this movie came out in 1972, it's just as gory as any ""Friday the 13th"" film. A man's hand is chopped off, a guy is shot point blank in the eye with blood and brains oozing out of the socket, and a woman in a wheelchair has her head lopped off with blood spurting from the neck. It's a lousy movie and not scary at all, but the gore shocked me. Too bad this was the late, great Agnes Moorehead's last film."
3,kids guitar book,also still getting into this book so cannot say exactly how it will be. when the girls get into learning more will know more about the book
4,Kids Guitar Course Book 1,"Kid's Guitar Course Book 1, It would have been 5 stars if it were a DVD so the kids could follow along on screen"
5,Easy To understand,Bought my son a guitar for Christmas. Looked and researched books to help him learn to play. After searching for a while I chose this one and am glad I did. It is easy to understand. My son is 10 years old and I don't think it is too young for him. I recommend it...
3,"Decent, not great","I don't think this book is quite as great as some other reviews have made it out to be, but it has been better for my couple of younger students than the Mel Bay book. The smaller, easier 3 string chord forms are good for young kids that don't have hands big or strong enough to play full 5 and 6 string chords. Towards the end there is a good mixture of single notes and chords which is nice. The variety of songs do a decent job of teaching about different rhythms and rests. However, I'm not crazy about the lyrical element, they have not helped at all, especially since the written melody for guitar doesn't usually match up with the traditional melody that would go with the lyrics used from well known kids songs. Still glad I chose to get a couple copies of this."
5,"Easy, Fun, Hassle Free","My son, age 11, used this as his first introduction to playing guitar and it has been wonderful! The book, cd, dvd combo is priceless. The lessons are very short and easy to understand. We watched each one on the dvd and proceeded to use the book for hours of practice. The dvd is wonderful when it comes to explaining concepts but also to be able to rewind and hear over and over. A huge plus was being able to play along with the dvd to help keep time. He breezed through this in a short 7 weeks and enjoyed every minute. This course made learning guitar a joy for our family."
4,Great for raw beginners.,"The Alfred's Kid's Guitar Course 1 is fantastically illustrated and provides very clear descriptions of how to hold a guitar, a plectrum, how to strum and how to tune. It uses colorful cartoon characters on each page, making the usually dry information about notation and tab reading very entertaining. I disagree with the habit that a lot of these basic level books have of reducing the chords to one finger versions. I will use these to get students initially enthused about playing but i call them ""cheat C"" and so on. In my experience kids can learn the simple smaller chords like D, A and E and be quickly playing songs. The book is well written overall and combines chord playing and note picking in a fun, engaging manner."
2,Fine If You Have Nothing Else,"I'm a guitar teacher and I used this book in the past because there wasn't much out there for teaching kids. I found it to be a very disappointing method. The first song introduces a mini version of a C major chord. I never had a student that could sound the three notes cleanly in their first several lessons. After using the method for several years I realized that it was probably too difficult for young children (4-7). I decided to make my own method, which I have had great success with. It's called ""Kasey's Guitar Jams for Kids"" and you can find it right here on Amazon. I think that your child or student will have great success with the guitar using it because it makes learning easy and fun, and those are two things that kids like."
4,"Good course, but very easy for those who've had music",My daughter launched into this course on the day she received her guitar. She enjoyed the book and went through the whole thing in one day-- It's very simple. She is 10 yrs old and has taken piano and violin.
3,"Ok, but have found better","I have taught guitar for 12 years and was looking for a simpler book for the youngest beginners. This book has a decent concept in that it gets small kids playing 3 string chords right away, however it really suffers in that it does not include a sing along cd. The cd is instrumental only. Also, it prints words for singing the first songs in the text without notes for the teacher, so unless you have a kid who will practice every time with the cd, and can listen to the melody instrument to know what to sing, these songs just arent going to get into the kids heads enough to really learn to play. The end gets much better and introduces single note reading pretty well. I definately prefer the Hal Leonard guitar for kids book which is just as simple, less visually distracting, has better songs with vocals added to the recording which just seems to get kids more into the music. I am going to use this book as supplemental material if I need it in addition to the other book."
3,it's okay,"My husband and children wanted to try guitar. They took this course together. It moves through the lesson too fast and wasn't useful to my children. They were just confused. My husband got the gist but didn't much care for the way it was thrown together. If you don't mind hitting the pause button frequently, you could do very well. We found some great online lessons instead and they're doing much better now."
1,A ripoff,"This incredibly thin book, complete with mis-spellings and errors, is not going to teach anyone anything about guitars, or how to play the guitar. I would not recommend it to anyone, regardless of age."
3,Probably great for very young kids,"I decided to purchase this book along with the Hal Leanard Guitar method books based on reviews which seemed to indicate this would be best for kids under 10. My son is 7 1/2 and this book is really too young for him. He had been taking lessons for only 1 month when I purchased it and it is more basic then what he started with. He is very intelligent and reads very well for his age so, might work ok for other kids around this age. Hoping to be able to use for my 5 1/2 year old daughter should she decide on lessons next fall, I think it will work well for her."
3,by a beginner,"I bought this book for my 3rd grader who wanted to learn guitar. I bought it for the DVD. The DVD is only sound, no video, and hard to follow. He goes right into the next lesson. DD was completely lost and still on page one when he was half way through the book. Dissapointed....we'll have to find her someone who can give her some lessons to get started with it."
3,KYLEE REVIEW,GOOD STARTER LESSONEASY TO READ AND VERY FUN FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES SURE KEEPS THEM INTERESTED AND WANTING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE GUITAR
2,Not the greatest...,"Basically what you have is a cheap Chinese made digital camera with a pretty decent underwater housing. The battery life is so short you need a spare or you better be ready to recharge when you can. The lens isn't very good although the macro capability is surprisingly good. Shooting underwater isn't easy under any conditions but the lag on this camera is bad enough that you simply end up ""spraying and praying"" for your shots. If you want to do serious underwater photography this camera would be good for learning but you really need to go with pro gear."
5,Loved It!,"We loved this video. We are very selective about what our kids (2 and 3 1/2 year) watch and their viewing time is also very limited. This is one program I recommend. They love seeing Baby Elmo and Big Bird and then imitating the games they play (these games are worth imitating unlike some shows). Regular Sesame Street looses their interest, but they are drawn into the songs and games on this show."
2,not such a fan,"I have several of these videos. My 3 month old loves ""making music together."" Of course ""making music together"" is better for small babies because they like music and you should always sing to them. ""Moving together"" is for babies that can already move a lot more, walk, etc...so maybe that's part of the reason I didn't like it. I found the songs a lot less catchy and the situations a lot less cute in general. I don't really like the presence of Sarah Jessica Parker, maybe because I associate her with ""Sex and the City"" and she just seems out of place on a video for babies. The child with her is also not hers, so that makes her seem a bit poser-ish."
3,cute,"This is cute, but we liked the others from the series even more. We ordered this because we like ""Sara Jessica Parker."" She was good in it. The others seemed to have cuter songs and seemed more active and exciting to our son, but we plan to try this some more. I have noticed that with babies and children, sometimes they do not take to something right away, but they end up loving it after trying again."
2,Not very impressed with this,"This movie might be okay for children under age one, but don't waste your money buying it for toddlers. My two year old daughter loves Sesame Street, but she has absolutely no interest in this movie. I think it was kind of boring to her. It would be better if they showed more of the Sesame Street characters, but instead they show children playing with their parents, either crawling around or running. Just not that much of an attention grabber."
3,description,"Have you ever wondered how a life is constructed? Is it destiny or is it chance? Whether you know it or not, each of us has created our life by the choices made. Michelle Whitedove delves into Creating Your Reality. She teaches that we make our future. No matter what situation we were born into; race, religion or economic background our soul is strong enough overcome any difficulty. Learn the steps of conscious choices that give you the opportunity to create the life that you deserve!"
2,typical bar,"I love the Oh Yeah products and have tried multiple items however, this item is your typical bar dry and taste like saw dust. Will not buy this paticular bar again."
1,JUNK,It does indeed have cast threads that barely work; I have to rap the chuck while tightening to get it to hold a bit firmly and later need channel locks to loosen it. The palm grip spins on the shaft without even touching the bearings at its end. Not worth sending back and I got two good used ones with bits on an auction site for much less than the $100 or more for a quality european made brace.
1,Chuck broke first day of use - returned for credit,"The 2-jaw chuck on this brace did not grip the auger's hex-shaped bit well; in addition, one of the chuck's jaws snapped in half the first day I used it. Do not purchase this if you are going to subject the brace to any high stress. I guess you get what you pay for. I returned this for credit and purchased the Robert Larson brace with 3-jaw chuck. The Robert Larson brace was more than twice the price of the Fuller model, but the Larson is better built and did the job I needed of it well. For me, I would rather buy a more expensive, more robust tool and know that it was going to last. In the end, a cheap tool is just another thing to worry about."
3,FUNGUS KILLER,"This is the third bottle that I have purchased, but the latest bottle, which was purchased, was not a full bottle."
