4,Good debut album,"I really liked this album on the first listen to it. CANDYASS starts off with two solid tracks ""Social Nemesis"" and ""Stitches"". It is worth getting CANDYASS just to hear these two songs especially ""Stitches"". The rest of Orgy's debut album is a mixed bag of electronic hard rock, but I must admit, I liked their cover of New Order's ""Blue Monday"" after the fact. They played this to death on the radio and MTV, but ""Blue Monday"" is probobly the strongest track on the album.I recommend getting VAPOR TRANSMISSION first and then CANDYASS. This is a good buy used and there a plenty of merchants at Amazon.com selling CANDYASS... This is a worthy addition to any music collection."
2,Hard rock for candyasses,"Wow, gotta love their cover of New Order's Blue Monday, with its pulsing super-distorted guitars joining the synthesizer lines. Unfortunately, the songs that the band wrote for themselves don't fare as well. The album doesn't start off too shabbily, with Social Enemies and Stitches being quite listenable. It also finishes off well with the sparsely written but undeniably catchy Dizzy. The majority of the tracks in the middle, however, are so boring and uninteresting that you find yourself just staring into space and not even listening. I can't listen all the way through about half of these songs. The ones I can aren't terribly special anyway. Best songs - Blue Monday, Platinum, Stitches, Dizzy. Worst Songs - Dissention, Revival, the 10th one (so forgettable I don't even know the name), I'm too lazt to write the others."
2,cluttered and harsh,"Be warned if you are a first time buyer of Orgy's music that aside from the few songs like Stitches that many will recognize from radio and mtv, most of this album is cluttered-sounding and harsh. For a band with so much emphasis on synths and electronics, the vast majority of Candyass is not danceable or catchy; instead it seems as though they've tried to carve out a niche for themselves by attempting to create ""artsy"" synth-rock instead of an accessible product. As a result, most of this album is discordant and jarring. I give it two stars for being pretty unique and having a number of good ideas; but overall, this cd rarely receives any play time from me. Try Zeromancer or Celldweller for shining examples of the best of this genre."
3,Great industrial / futuristic rock,"This CD, kudos, you can listen to the entire thing without getting bored and also you keep your body moving to the groove of the futuristic beats. Also, get this CD instead of Vapor Transmission, because it is far better and even has one more hit than the other CD."
3,Not exactly an Orgy ....,"I held out on buying this cd for a long time mainly because I kept seeing them on TRL on MTV, and decided that they were nothing more than a corporate rock creation. But after hearing ""Stitches"" I decided that maybe there was more to this band than I first thought. I was right. While not all the songs are gems, ""Revival"", ""All The Same"" and the above mentioned ""Stitches"" are worth the cd. The Synth-pop-goth-rock lite hybrid actually works pretty well for the most part. I'll be buying their next cd. It wouldn't hurt to check them out."
2,Didn't Meet My Expectations......,"Wow......I was really dissappointed once I got this album. I had been waiting to get it for a while and once I get it I get let down horribly. These guys aren't industrial, they aren't hard-core.......I really don't know what they are and I found that most of the CD sounded the same. If you really want some good stuff check out Nine Inch Nails, Stabbing Westward, Ministry, Gravity Kilss......and about any other CD from this genre, just have a look around. If you are thinking about buying this CD make sure that you can listen to it before hand, because it may alter your decision."
3,"Some songs are killer, but others are just terrible.","Techno is great! and ever since Rob Zombie popularized the rock/techno music, bands have been taking a stab at making a good techno/rock album. Orgy has done pretty good at this, and their hit songs are great, but a lot on the album need a lot of work. Their lyrics sometimes are a tad childish, but hey... :) It's a nice album."
5,Cool band even for techno listeners,"I've been listening to techno for almost all my life, but that music makes me change to ORGY! The best kind of music i've ever hearded!!! The beat is just great!"
4,"Good, if you like the style of music.","I bought Orgy's CD because I liked their songs ""Blue Monday"" and ""Stitches."" At first I wasn't sure if I really liked the other songs, but then they grew on me. Techno style of music that I don't hear to often. Job well done. Be warned, do not buy this CD unless you like hard rock/techno garage music that sometimes gives you a headache if you listen to it too much."
5,the best C.D. ever,"When i frist saw the Blue Monday video on MTV I thought that they were totally weird,but the more I listened to it the more i loved it. So, i went out & bought the C.D. i have only had the C.D. for a week & i've woorped it completely. I think this is the best C.D. I also think that if they release Platinum to radio it will go to #1! I hope that all of you buy this awsome C.D."
5,Something good is happening in music again.,"Not since the 1993 release of Duran Duran's self titled album have I been so inspired by a CD. Candy Ass is a combination of everything good in rock mixed with all the best of the latest ""alternative"" styles. The guys really took a chance creating this album and it deserves to be heard. The blend of synthesizing guitars, drum and bass beats and vocal melodies create an experience that has been lacking from the music charts for years. Buy Candy Ass...You won't be sorry."
4,industrial...umm no,"Alright lets get one thing straight, Orgy is not in any way shape or form industrial. I find there sound to be of pure originality and class. Orgy has got to have the best g-synth player in the music industry and pretty nifty drummer. The cd is is pretty good. Revival, Stiched, Freaks, and platinum are all quality songs. But if you guys realy wanna taste of industrial check out Front242, skinny puppy, or front line assembly."
5,The best (& ONLY) cd I've gotten this year so far....,"As I sit around waiting for some band to just take me away from this pop-dominated music scene, Orgy has done me a favor. I'm really surprised that Korn fans would like this cd, but I guess that's good. Yes, NEW ORDER's remake of ""Blue Monday"" (you DID know that, didn't you????)was an eye catcher (& NO I don't think it was a rip-off) on MTV back in December, but there are other good tunes on the cd as well, like ""Gender"" & ""All the Same"". I'm not a diehard industrial music fan cuz most industrial music gets repetitive after a while when there's no singing or melody going on, but Orgy does just the opposite. Ok, the lead singer doesn't have the best voice in the world, but really, what rock singers really do?? He looks good & the lyrics sound like they actually might mean something. I think Orgy has some potential to be more than just a 1 hit wonder, & I can't wait to hear what they'll do next."
4,A very satisfying album,"Don't listen to the Korn and Limp Bizkit fans, Orgy doesn't deserve to be lumped up in the same catagory merely because they were on the same tour. This is good synth rock music that should bring industrial-type music into the limelight. They've got tunes, they've got style and they seem to be really cool guys. And don't worry, Blue Monday isn't the only good song on this disc. Check out Fiend, Stitches and Dizzy. I encourage you to buy it..."
4,"Overall, a pretty good cd but......","This CD is a great one. I recommend it to industrial music fans. There is only one problem with some of the songs. The lead singer is not as talented as he could be, he needs to practice a little before he starts to sing professionally again. The best song on the CD is probably Blue Monday, but many others are good as well."
3,Another hybrid band,"Nine Inch Nails+KoRn=Orgy. If all you have to go on is their cover of Blue Monday, you might be a bit bummed. Candyass is a solid album musicly, but lacks any meaningful lyrics(yelling the F-word 20 times does not qualify a lyrics to me). If your a fan of the Family Values(tour), you will like this. If not, back away or find someone who has it. I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. Late"
4,Candyass or VT,"I can't decide which is better but they're both ok. In Candyass, half the songs are either outstanding or too rough and meaningless but really this is a good album on average."
2,Disappointing....,"With huge expectations, I purchased this CD and was dissapointed to find it bland and sorry. The only winner on the entire album is ""Stitches"", a soulful, strangely sexy and seductive number. The rest of the CD is too metalic, venturing into ""cheese goth"". Don't get me wrong, I respect Orgy and believe their hearts are in the right place, but comparing them to Depeche Mode or Nine Inch Nails? I'm sorry...maybe their next album will have the sexy venom of ""Stitches"""
4,it can only get better,"Even though ORGY comes off of KoRn's ELEMENTRY label they sound very different from their parent band. I bought this cd because I heard their cover of BLUE MONDAY and STICHES. I must confess that I was a little disappointed. There are a lot of good tracks on this album(i.e. STICHES, PLATINUM, FETISHA, BLUE MONDAY, PANTAMIME, and REVIVAL but also there are a lot of songs that sound alike. I do have faith though, that as they progress and put out more stuff, that they will improve. Don't listen to some people because with ORGY comming off of Korn's lable they were probably expecting more of the same."
5,ORGY (NEW MUSIC FOR THE MILENIUM),"I would recommend this CD to anybody to who likes a variety of different guitar styles. Orgy combines elecronica,pop and alternative all together to make an excellent CD. Each track is always something new to me. The tunes and guitar tabs are so catchy. You will love this CD if you enjoy any music with a lot of differnet variety and dark atomosphere, but certainly not depressing I would definetely reccomend you check this CD out!"
5,this album is knu wave music that everyone will love,"this album is kutting edge metal/electronica that all fans will absolutly adore. from full feeling balads such as Stitches...to upbeat dance classics like Blue monday, and deep, thoughtful lyrics as in Revival, theese guys have it all covered. buy the cd and check it out for yourself. youll soon find out that you love them just as much as we do!"
3,"Dissappointment beyond ""Blue Monday""","The slamming cover of ""Blue Monday"" got me to rush out and buy the album the next day. But the rest of the album doesn't quite stand up. Granted the rest of the original material doesn't have the hooks of New Order, but I was expecting a bit more from one of Korn's favorite bands. They spin industrial, heavy metal, funk and techo together, but never quite hit the right blend. Most of the songs come off a bit unfinished. However, I see promise in this band and hope they can mature into a second album."
5,Awwwesome,"I have had this cd since it came out. And ive been their fan ever since, but this album si what truely got me into the hardrock/metal genre, i cannot wait for Punk Statik Paranoia to be out on the 24th of febuary!"
4,Takes a couple of listenings to appreciate.,"I first came across Orgy when I heard Jay Gordon singing Slept So Long for the Queen of the Damned Soundtrack. His voice intrigued me. It's beautiful and sexy, as well as arrogant at certain times.Anyhow, their first album didn't disappoint me at all. Almost all of their songs have some merit to them. Contrary to most, I don't really care for Blue Monday. It's a great cover, but I just don't like 80s music that much...Don't discard this album after the first listen if you find you're not drawn to it. If I did that with most of the albums I bought, I'd be missing out on a lot of great music!"
4,Candyass rocks!,"Candyass is a damn fine cd of a damn fine band. I first heard of Orgy back in 1998 with their Blue Monday which was featured on the I still know what you did last summer soundtrack. Although the cd might be a bit out-dated, the music that's on it is still very good and many tracks instantly stick in your head and the cd is guaranteed to stay in your cd player for quite a long time. Although (in my opinion) Blue Monday is the best track on the cd, tracks such as Stitches, Dissention, Fiend, Gender and Revival are instant favorites and the rest is also very enjoyable. I really like Orgy's Death Pop style on this cd and I think it's a shame that Orgy don't get the respect and credit that they deserve. They are a great band and both their cd's (Candyass + Vapor Transmission) are must-haves in my opinion. I think that you can't go wrong buying this cd and giving Orgy a well-deserved try. Orgy rules and that's the bottom line!"
4,"Great Album, but Vapor Transmission dominates it!",I heard the Blue Monday and Stitches tracks on MTV when this album first came out and I could have took them or left them. It wasn't until I heard the Vapor Transmission tracks on Modern Rock Live did I take a second look at Orgy. I bought Vapor Transmission the very next day after hearing the tracks. I really enjoyed it so I picked up Candyass. I now wish I would have given Orgy that second look much sooner! Tracks like Revival are what really made this album. The synth style is very original and just goes to add to the album.
1,Just Plain Bad.,"I heard Orgy's cover of ""Blue Monday"" a long time ago, but at the time, I was about 7 or 8 and I didn't really like music. A few months ago, about 4 years later than that time, I bought this CD because I remembered the song from my youth and it was only $0.50 used, so I thought, ""what the hell!"" I wasted 50 cents. I could've bought 2 gumballs instead! ""Blue Monday"" is not near as great as I remembered it to be, and the rest of the songs are just awful. Their singer has no talent, and you get so sick of hearing his awful voice. The guitars are pretty bad, too. They sound like fricking keyboards!!! The only good musicians in this band are the drummer and the bassist. And another complaint:the lyrics. Their awful, and they make no sense, and they just sound STUPID!! Just listen to ""Gender""'s choruses' lyrics! What they should do is kick out Jay Gordon, or just make him a keyboardist (because he does play keyboards) and get their guitarists to buy some different sounding guitars! GOD!"
1,No fun at this Orgy!,"While never being a fan of their cover of Blue Monday, I was skeptical concerning the quality of their own songs. After listening to this CD I know why they released Blue Monday as the first single. Social Enemies = crap; Stitches = crap, Dissention = crap, etc. Stay far away from Candyass!"
1,uggggh!,"i went to the korn concert in houston a few months ago, and orgy sounded pretty cool(they opened for korn) so i bought the cd, and it sucked. the guitars are all airy, instead of sounding just good and solid, and all the songs sound the same. the worst bucks ive ever spent. Korn should kick em off their label coz they are s**t!"
1,This CD is extremely overrated.,"This cd has one good song on it. Blue Monday. That's all. The rest of the cd (including stitches) sounds like noise. In fact, it reminds me of a bunch of 6 year-olds hammering on their big brother's musical instruments. Unless you're in to ear wrenching noise, don't purchase this cd."
5,Orgy Kicks @$$,"Orgy is the best band around. The excellent mix of rock and techno and death sound (low tone, deathly subjects) is a great mix. I like how they have their own type of style which is make-up, cool designed clothes, and freaky hair do's. Trust me, listen to them when you get a chance to, especially the song ""Dissention"""
4,"Orgy is great, but...","Orgy is a great band with a new twist on ind. rock. The only problem I have with this CD is, Jonthon Davis. I've heard people complain that tis is not like korn, and that's a bad thing? I'm glad they don't sound like korn.So, all in all it's a great CD, but u might want to skip #11 (Revival)"
4,"Too much from too many, but good.","All in all, Candyass is an great album. BUT, they might be trying to put too many different styles of music together. Blue Monday sounds sooooo good because the song was already there, they just covered it. The rest of the album is nowhere near what its reputaion puts it. It's a lot of what they tried for, they managed the 80's sound, but they missed the bill for most of todays music fans. It's good, but don't buy it if you've only herd Blue Monday, get a single."
3,techno?,"I hate techno, untill i came across this cd. It's ok. The only good song is Blue Monday. Don't waste your money on this. Just go out and buy the cd single."
4,KICKASS,"This album is awesome! Everyone complains about the lyrics and the sound being too different, but that is exactly why I love it! But who am I to judge I've listened to everyone from Madonna & Prince to Metalica & Megadeth! But this new sound gets to me like NO OTHER! I have to crank it! I bought the album, of course, after I heard Blue Monday and I love Stitches and find it quite ironic that I thought that should be their next release, AND IT IS! The other songs are still growing on me but I just love those two songs for their individual sound and they just grabbed me! We all need something a little bit different and - out there - So I think you should try it! It'll probably get into your veins so that you can't get enough of it- I always push repeat so it's hard to listen to the hole CD all the time!"
5,Orgy is the greatest! (now this guy could sing),"I could listen to this album straight through w/out changing a single song! my favorite song is Platinum, the part when he says:""turn down the voluptious"" is bad ***! i like every word on it, this is definately my favorite cd right now, i bought the cd a while back and im still not even tired of it, i listen to it everyday just to get stoked! You can listen to this cd when you're upset off, happy, or even sad it doesnt matter its still awesome! Good luck on next album guys! Peace!"
3,cant beleive they had the audacity to cover blue monday,"This is not the worst music out there. But its not great either, just another decent modern rock band. And the only radio friendly song was a cover. Listeners would be much better off if they go rediscover new order (who wrote Blue Monday) and joy division (the precursor to New Order and ""the most influential band of the last 20 years"" rolling stones) Overall if i went to the store, with fifteen bucks and this was the only album i could find i would buy it and be adequately satisfied, but i wouldnt be leaping for joy. A decent choice"
4,"half and half, pretty good","This Candyass cd has 6 good songs and 6 terrible songs. i wish the whole cd was good so i wouldn't have to keep frowarding to a better song every time one i don't like comes on. About the lyrics, they are OK compared to some rap i have heard this cd has plenty of content, But, For those who realy listen for a meaning in the lyrics, you won't find one. I personally like the sound. 2 7 8 10 11 are cool. 9 is ok. the rest suck"
1,Not very kool at all!,Orgy has really missed the bullseye on this release of theirs. All of the songs sound about the same and even the lyrics are indiscernable. The songs just kind of drift and wander and don't really go anywhere. Its almost unbearable.
5,candyass reveiw,"many people seem to be uncomprehensive, because they don't understand the meanings of the songs.candyass is badass...and orgy is only looking towards many greater albums."
1,its sickening,this album is boring to say the least. the compostions are stale and void of any original thought. these guys won't last very long if you ask me.
3,"Diamond in the rough, if you wanna dig","okay, i was a little disapointed. I had heard ""Blue monday"" a lot and I loved it, but this CD is kinda dull. It has a couple cool tracks, but the rest just sound the same and are very monotone and dull. if you want ""Blue Monday"", buy the single. Only metal and KoRn fans should come here otherwise."
2,Orgy,"This band has a really nice style. I love 'Blue Monday' (of course) and 'Stitches'. I also like 'Fiction (Dreams In Digital)' on their newer CD. However, this band just isn't all that good, it's mostly like a spoken-word, Stream-of-Consciousness record, with some instrumentals. The singles are very different from what you get on the CD, and I can't embrace what's given. J. Davis is featured on a track. They could/should be much better and I hope to see them become better at what they do."
3,Not too great but not too shabby,"As far as being the future of rock Nine Inch Nails have been doing music better-and more futuristic-for years. Even rip off bands do it better like Filter who are actually starting to branch off into their own style. Fear Factory is better but much,much harder and people consider them 'Machine Metal'(they're also doing things that have never been done before). This is just watered down Industrial for the masses(and MTV-ugh). That's not to say this su**s though, 'cause it doesn't, it's just that if you listen to those bands I mentioned you'll realize it's 'borrowed' music is commercial. Once again though, I do like it. The singles are the best, ""Stitches"" being my favorite 'cause it has a killer guitar riff on it. ""Platinum"" is great and I think the drummer is really talented. The rest fairs. I think their second album will be better. But not ""The Fragile"" though."
4,It was good but it could have been better.,"Orgy is a very talented group. I was kinda upset about the album because al the songs kinda sound the same. The best tracks are ""Stiches"" and ""Blue Monday."" Also they use the ""F"" word a little to much. Other then that the CD was awesome!!!!"
1,"Grungy, in-your-face, garbage","Yeah, after listening to this album I came to the conclusion that it needs dire help. After hearing the overplayed, thinly veiled ""Blue Monday"" I'm coming to realize that these untalented bands off the street are ripping off classic songs from classic bands. This deranged, infantile assortment of generic, copycat, absurdity has got to stop in the music world. Now I'm no pschological philosopher or anything related to that field but I know that it would behoove the ""musician"" or ""musicians"" to make up their own music."
5,Very well understood,"I love this cd because of it almost Rock type of beat with such deep lyrics. The lyrics mean a lot to a song and these songs are great! Probably the most well known song on here is Blue Monday. ""How do you feel"" is probably one of the catchiest song lines in Music today."
2,A metalhead's view,"If you're not into heavy music and you listen to light stuff like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Incubus, don't bother reading any further. I'm personally into heavier music and don't see much special about this album. To me the only tracks that really stand out are ""Revival"", ""Blue Monday"", and ""Dissention"" - other than that the rest of the album pretty much sounds the same, with a singer who interestingly enough sounds a lot like Marilyn Manson. Don't get me wrong, I listen to a few of the songs from time to time, but I think there many other albums which are more worth your money. Not bad for a debut though."
3,time warp with a twist,"despite what the top people say manson has nothing to do with this band. honestly, i cant even imagine how they came up with that. this is a band that sounds like the 80's but sings about the in a 90's sense. come on, they did a new order cover for crying out loud. so if you like the 80's sound and love the expressive style we have here in the 90's then get it and enjoy."
5,Orgy is a great new band that I can't stop listening to.,"Even though they sound similar to Marilyn Manson, they could beat his ass with a bat! This band is truly amazing and I love their style of music. I give a lot of thanks to my favorite band, KoRn, for bringing Orgy into the music scene. They are my favorite new band and I hope that you will pick up Candyass."
5,Fabulous pan,"I recently bought this pan. I wanted to buy the Le Creuset because I knew that it would be the best choice for my new black glass cooktop. I had looked at the square one in the stores but found that the oval was priced 40% less. I'm so glad I have the oval shape as I think it holds more.These are amazing pans, I'm finding that I use it everyday. Chicken has never tasted as good or cooked so easily and vegtables are fabulous.Cleaning the pan is more time consumming than I would like but I think it's worth the effort given the ease and quality of the cooking."
2,Impossibly small postcards.,"What you get here is a mosaic on every page with innumerable photos (that might or might not be postcards) so small that they are postage stamp sized - on a large monitor. Kindle apps don't zoom so you're simply out of luck.I'm guessing that at one per page these would be quite interesting. But who knows, it's impossible to make them out as published. Unaccountable."
2,not what i expected,"this music reminded me of club dance music. like rave music. i just expected more gentle, peaceful sounds."
2,Are you tired of being a guinea pig?,"Ms. Duke has tried to write a fun way to teach math. Instead what she has created is a tired and disinteresting short picture book.I gave this book the ""babysitter test"" I took my favorite five year old with me to the local bookseller and tried reading this to her. She asked me to get another book before page 8. This is not lack of attention. She is known to be enthralled by Sendak or DePaulo.I would recommend you view this book before purchasing..if you do."
3,logos,"as you would expect, most of the designs are very good, but other than a quick self-congratulatory introduction there is no text in this book, just 206 redundant pages of the instantly recognizable logos of very common US corporations which one can see on billboards, buildings and tv screens everywhere anytime. i would have liked at least a brief description of the thought processes of their creation."
2,double cane clip,"Good idea, but it did not fit. Clips were too loose making cane fall and drag on ground."
3,"Bulky, but it does work.",It does the job. Kinda bulky. Doesn't fit in tight spots. Must have plenty of room on the walker or chair.
2,Needs improvement,It doesn't clamp on tightly enough to the walker or to the cane. So gravity makes everything slip down until it hits a place on the walker where something stops it. The clamping mechanism is not adjustable to make it tighter and this improvement should be made to the product. Putting some tape around the tubing of the cane or walker could help the problem.
3,Does it Job,Not the best system for getting a camera on and off a tripod. I like the SLIK system better.
3,Noise rock / sludge rock,"Remarkable how much this stuff sounds like Flipper, hearing it many years later. You get that slow plodding kind of rhythm, feedback galore and shouted vocals... but there the comparison pretty much ends. Red Bliss had trouble finding hooks for their songs, so the album is a little spotty.The fact that the singer can't sing much at all, really, was part and parcel for bands of this genre. Fans of Killdozer might have dug this, but Red Bliss were sorta lost in the noise in 1990 because so many releases sounded like this one."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"I suffered with this machine for 30 days before returning it to the store. When you read the package it sounds like a great machine with many useful features. And it would be, if the features worked. The whole machine was unreliable - messages got cut off, sound quality was mixed, I had difficulty reading the display, and the controls were a bit too difficult to use.I switched to a Casio and am much happier. That's after having owned AT&T answering machines for over 10 years. Please, learn from my mistake."
2,Buggy as all get out,"I bought this answering machine thinking this would be a low-cost, high-quality alternative to voice mail. You get what you pay for with this turkey. Be careful how you scroll through your call history, for you might find your voice messages inaccessible as a result. See an item in your call history in the first scroll through, then...poof...gone without a trace."
3,Ok at best,"Set-up is very easy. The machine does not offer what the editorial review says it does in terms of number of messages and length of total messages. Sound is clear enough. In two months, it appears to be working well enough for just receiving calls and deleting them. ( )"
3,"Nice machine, strange problems for me","Setup and installation was very easy. Voice quality was fair; I had expected better. The real problems happened when I had the machine connected to my phone line. The clock would reset to midnight every 8-10 minutes and record an incoming call (the Call ID list, not a message). AT&T tech support suggested a conflict with the local phone company, and that I should take it up with them. I chose not to get involved in this dispute and returned the unit. (Amazon was great about taking it back)."
4,Other reviews are misleading,"I was scared to order this answering machine because of the other reviews. After using the machine for a couple of weeks, I understand the problems, but do not find them to be of much concern. This machine is not as intuitive as some AT&T products I've used before, but unless you do something wrong, it is very dependable. I would echo the complaint that the LCD is not backlit, and as I said it is less than intuitive, but overall, it's a great deal."
1,ATT/Lucent Digital machines are not dependable,"I have purchased a model 1725 machine that did not last 2 weeks. I returned it for repair/exchange and ordered another for a spare, then another for a second line. Less than 3 months later none of these machines are usable. I have lost valuable messages and will not return these for repair -- the service I received leads me to shop for another brand. I have also sold telephones and found that of all the brands that I sold, ATT was the one that was returned the most. Buy another brand!"
2,You only get one block...,"Although the title and description seemed to indicate otherwise, a quantity of 1 means 1 yoga block. I was quite disappointed to discover that for myself, after I paid what seemed reasonable for a pair, but ended up with only one."
1,Don't Buy This Game,"Do not waste your money on this title. StrikerPro 2000 is a terrible game. The graphics and sound are horrible. But the real problem with this game is the gameplay. The players have NO tricks in ball handling. And stealing the ball is just a matter of running towards the player with it. Passing is a joke, the goals are too big and the computers AI is terrible. If you are looking for an axtual fun soccer title, go to the FIFA series. If you own a FIFA title and were looking for something more, keep looking."
1,"The worst soccer game ever, please stay away from this one","hey just simply dont buy this soccer game, well it just cant be called soccer game because, i think the creators of this abomination, dont know nothing about soccer. The graphics are bad, the gamplay is just horrible and the comentary is just clumsy. The other thing you just cant score goals, you got super goalies. I mean i just play this thing twice to realize that this is just the worst soccer game ever. If you want a soccer game for the Dreamcast go for Virtua Striker2 is quite much better than this game. This is just a waste of money."
3,OK,"overall the album is ok...not all the songs live up to how wonderful ""Underwater Love"" is. It's not a bad album, but I wish there were more tracks! Underwater Love is the track that made me want to get the album. There are only 10 tracks and it is expensive because it's an import cd. I really do like the singer's voice though =) ""Devil Mood"" and ""Numbers"" have more Jungle elements intertwined with them while ""Dark Walk"" is an instrumental track that is more Trip-Hop. ""Giulietta"" is just a boring track and definetly a ""filler"" ""Jamie Pan"" is also a weak track...the album has a total of 10 tracks of which 3 range from 3 mins and 11 secs to 3 mins and 48 secs. The best track is unltimately ""Underwater Love"" which is a great 6 mins a 46 secs. Songs to download: ""With You"" and ""Aguas de Marco"" Also I think the group Supreme Beings of Leisure offers much better albums but they only sing in English."
4,Trip-hop French Bossa Nova Bliss,"I fell in love with the song ""Underwater Love"" on the Ultimate Chillout CD Collection, but had not heard anything else by Smoke City until I recently purchased this CD. I am so glad that I finally screwed up the courage to pick this up. While I am not as completely blown away by this as some of the other reviewers here are, I am still quite impressed.The entire album is incredible and all of the songs are just as fabulous as ""Underwater Love"", some even better I dare say. Sexy, smoky, sophisticated, and completely lounge-worthy. The vocals are incredible, and are delivered in a multiple of languages.So go ahead, don't be afraid to take a chance on this. I would be hard-pressed to imagine any fan of trip-hop, bossa nova, or downtempo lounge disliking this unique little number, which is a perfect marriage of all three genres."
1,Don't bother,"We very much enjoyed the first four Leap Frog DVDs, but this one is terrible. I'd say invest in the first two, Letter Factory and Math Factory. They are much better done."
5,great hands-off review for tots!!,"Like the other Leap videos, this one has catchy music and plenty of action to keep toddlers occupied! Reviews Days of week; months and seasons of the year; counting 1-20; more than and less than; letters and sounds. Excellent!"
1,Hugely disappointed,"I am hugely disappointed with the educational value of this DVD. My 2-year-old might as well be watching cartoons. We watched it once and it's going back in it's box and will not be watched again. I also agree with all of the other reviewers in terms of the lack of consistency with prior videos featuring Tad and Lily. I, too, have recommended Letter Factory and Word Factory to other parents, but I am disappointed with this one."
4,Let's go to school,It was a great DVD it went over the Letters of the Alphabet explaining the sight and sound of each letter and made it fun. I would recomend it to all parents trying to teach there kids to learn their letters.
2,Awful singing!,"Tad and Lily are completely different in this compared to the older DVDs. Apparently they are now twins. In addition to the unnecessary change in the birth order, the singing in this video is absolutely horrible - Off key, hard to hear, and just plain bad. The content is decent with numbers and days of the week presented but it is difficult for anyone to hear and difficult for an adult to watch, unlike the Sony produced videos which were enjoyable for adults as well as children. I could have sung better than these characters . . . which is not saying much. Additionally, all the characters sound like their noses are clogged. The whole sound track is unpleasant. I am giving it two stars only because the content is decent and my daughter did not walk out of the room while the video was playing."
4,not the same as the other dvds :(,this dvd is not the same as the others. Tad and Lilly are not the same they look and sound different. It is also a different format. It is more on the speed of Sesame Street meaning it has small segments. But with the said our son has loved all the Leap Frog phonics dvds and he loved this one as well.
1,How Sad,"How sad - the other entries in this series are absolutely fantastic, they made my daughter excited about learning. This one diverges from the rest with poor writing and poor computer animation (the facial expressions are frozen in place). They repeat over and over that everyone is nervous on their first day of school - good luck NOT being nervous after hearing that over and over! Overall, this one is complete crap."
1,Don't bother,"We bought this for our daughter because she is about to enter kindergarten, and because the other leap frog videos we have purchased were awesome. This one however, is just ridiculous. The content and the animation have really gone down hill. There is no character continuity between this video and the rest. The First 5 have Tad learning his alphabet and numbers with Lilly and Leap (his older siblings) helping him. Then in this one he magically forgot everything he's learned at the Letter Factory. Plus Lily is no longer his older sister, but is now his twin. This one just seems really dumbed down compared to the others."
1,BORing and my tot didn't even watch it,Do not buy if your little guy is distracted all the timeThis will deft not catch his Attention it's boring even I think it is as aParent !
2,Why not focus on things not learned in the other DVDs,"I am a fan of the Leap Frog series. We have the others and my kids love them.When I bought this one I was excited as my oldest was getting ready to go to preschool.After watching this with them I am disappointed to see that time was spent on already covered topics (letters) and topics that add a minor value when just starting school (animal groupings).They could have spent more time on time/calender, math.If they were going to do a section on letters then it would be appropriate to talk about how to write them and not going through sounds again with different symbols compared to the earlier DVD. I liked the counting with the small section on numbers larger/smaller in comparison with the building blocks. The math topics do not need to be advanced to be valuable.Also, Leap and Lilly were different ages in previous videos and now they are the same age.If you create a series of videos, please stay consistent."
2,Not the Best Praise on the Market,"I bought this CD on the basis of the favorable reviews it had received here. Was very disappointed to find it was not Vineyard-style praise music. Or maybe the music was, but there was a lot of yelling involved rather than the worshipful singing I'd looked forward to. I'm just glad that it arrived too late for me to give it to my secret sister at work (the original intended recipient). I love the Lord, and I love enthusiastic worship. But this is ""off,"" somehow. Listen to a track before you buy it. Do as I say, not as I did."
3,it was okay,"this album was okay for me,but it did not move me. i thought some of the songs could have been cut short. But like i said, this is only my opinion. Someone gave it to me because she did not like the album and i tried to give it back but she does not want it."
2,Shekinah Glory CD (s),"The CD contents is very inspirational, however should there be 2 CD's? After all, the songs that I was looking for are all on CD 2.I believe although I did not get what I expected, I still can enjoy the one CD that I recieved."
1,Not exactly what I expected...,"I was expecting more music and less talking. I had heard a portion of one of the songs on a answering machine and this prompted me to purchase the CD. After a fruitless search for some salvageable music tracts, I gave the CD to someone in more of a need of a sermon."
3,A lot of junk on this CD,"I am truly disappointed with this CD....I am trying to figure out how to get the unnecessary junk away from the music....It's a live taping....with way too much holy roller screamin'....Some of the music is good, some very repetitious. I heard the ""Praise is what I do"" song on a PBS special and loved it, so I bought the CD......and the speakin' in tongues....YUCK.....oh well..."
5,Praise music,This is such a blessing. The praise and worship tracks are truly an awesome thing!!!!!!! If u really want to get into worship I highly recommend this cd.
5,God's Throne Room,"This CD is sooooo annoninted. One of our members brought it to prayer last week and it took us to a new level. We were just ushered into the presence of God. Almost everyone that was there wanted to buy this CD. Hence, that is why I am here now. We must pray for this ministry because with an annoninting like this the enemy will not let them just continue without opposition. May the protection of the God, the unity of God, the provision of God, and the LOVE of God be present with them always."
5,Shekinah Glory in Valley Kingdom,"Hallelujah! The highest praise for the majestic display of His excellent works on this cd. Like David, you will become undignified."
5,It can't get no better than this,"This is a powerful, worshipful, and God - glorifying package. It is such innocent worship, and allows the listener to eavesdrop and enter in. Without a doubt, you will experience an amazing visitation of the Lord's Presence. This not entertainment, but rather true worship obviously aimed at the heart of God. Hence, it leaves you with a sense of being privileged to experience such a genuine worship atmosphere. I recommend it to anyone."
5,Highly Annointed,"God slipped this one up on me just when I needed it most. One cannot speak about this CD and not use the word ""Annointed"" because that's just what this recording is....especially CD #2.Lots of prayer, fasting, and waiting on the Lord went into the making of this CD! Just listen and you'll agree!"
2,Did not enjoy this cd at all,"I bought it b/c I like the song Praise is what I do and all I get is this one person/lady screaming, she turns me off truly hearing her coming thru my car stereo. I rarely listen to this cd. Too much talking and not enough singing. I could have done well with a single."
5,Join true worshippers&praise teams in God's Kingdom!,"Heard the title cut aired on Emmett Powell's gospel program, and always had to stop whatever I was doing to take part in the worship experience with The Almighty. I was led to get this CD and see what else was waiting. It exceeded any expectation. Have shared with family the awesomeness of the God's anointing on this project from start to end. This release guides you into an orderly ordained and protected place in time with God. Nearly impossible to play one cut. I loaned this CD to my child, and it was never returned. Not a word from her yet if it will be! I was compelled to consider it a gift and bought another copy. That is how fruitful their ministry has become. Get your own and plan to buy two! Seriously! May you have great time with God, too."
5,A Religious Experience Over And Over,"I first heard Shekinah Glory Ministry froma friend and i had to have this cd. It is one of my all time favorites and stays in my cd player. Every time i listen to it, whether at work, in my car, or at home, i relive the experience of being close to God! It is the right mix of praise and worship and ministry. I thank God for this!!Dr. C.J. Christopher Williams"
3,Wow!,"Didn't care for the praise disc, but the worship....oh my goodness! This cd was truly a blessing to me! And it's my husband's favorite as well!"
4,pretty good,"This is a fun game to play, and I have played it though several times. very interesting and fun....would recommend it to anyone who likes the search form of gaming."
2,Doesn't seem to be as exciting as Ravenhearst,"I bought this along with Ravenhearst, and I've heard all about playing Ravenhearst, but nothing about playing ""Prime Suspects."" I don't get into either of those games, but if you're picking one or the other, go with Ravenhearst."
4,Mystery Case Files Prime Suspects,"If you like Mystery Case Files games, then this is yet another that will keep you thrilled and amused for many hours. Really compelling game play and terrific graphics!"
1,boring,did not enjoy this movie at all. the storyline was boring it ddint test mind in anyway. finding the objects was pretty easy to me
4,Colin Firth's Big Television Break,"Colin Firth's first memorable TV role - and doesn't he look young! This series links the beginning of the decline of the British Empire with beginning of the decline of the British Music Hall - the former with the First World war and the latter with the advent of cinema. The script is superb and Colin Firth and John Castle's performances are excellant. There is a cameo role in the first episode from Sir Laurence Olivier but it is obvious that his skill is in decline.The main story is Colin's (Richard Herncastle's) coming of age - as he certainly learns about life in the music halls before he is shipped out to the horrors of the War. He loses his love but miraculously regains it in the trenches when fate decrees that she turns up to entertain the troops, Colin gets wounded and she saves him.It is a wonderful story to get lost in on a cold winter's night and I greatly recommend it."
3,The Lost Empires,"I'm a Colin Firth fan and so I particularly enjoyed this 3 volume boxed set of The Lost Empires. It was an interesting glimpse behind the scenes and into the world of live variety shows! The characters were colorful and interesting. I thought there should have been more insight to the Uncle Nick character, but this was an account of a brief span in time and the life of Richard Herncastle as was told thru his eyes.Colin Firth was awesome as the naive and handsome young Richard Hernacastle and I was very entertained watching him fuddle his way thru love, trials and heartbreak as he made his way into manhood."
2,Lost Entertainment,"This is an expensively made, poorly written, and well-acted soap opera. It's the basic poor boy goes on tour with the vaudeville plot. And all the thrills of show business from the inside...the heartaches, the bad breaks, the freaks, the mean comedians, the tart girls, etc. etc. And it seems never to end: three discs worth of pathos. Olivier, by the way, was inserted into the film briefly in order for him to play a one-dimensionsal drunken old comic and get his name on the marquee.It is all so breathtakingly superficial and uninteresting."
4,Produced by a Tobacco company?...,"It must have been... Characters are CONSTANTLY smoking SOMETHING. Cigars, cigarettes, even a hookah at one point. It seems at times there's barely a moment when there isn't someone smoking in the scene.However, that's my only complaint-- I thought the plot was unique, it was pretty well executed, and most of the acting is pretty good. I saw the whole thing in two days, 1/2 at a time and was quite engrossed. All in all quite good, but I felt I had to say something about the incessant and unnecessary infusion of tobacco in just about every scene..."
1,you have got to be kidding!!!!!,"this is a very good series, however i would not pay over $25 for it. this is not rare or even hard to find! go order it from your local video store it cost $30 from them. but profitering on an item that is not even the least bit difficult to obtain you have got to be kidding!!!!!"
1,If you want John Williams don't buy this MIDI compilation,"This cd set was sent to me in error...when I was told that I was being sent the correct merchandise..they told me to keep this cd set. Thinking I got a good deal, I listend to it.....I thought it must be a joke it was so bad. It sounds as if it was made with a computer MIDI player...poorly. The CD case looks as if it is John Williams and an actual orchestra but after reading closer, it is just a man and a computer. If you want fine John Williams Orchestral music...don't buy this. You are warned"
5,Great study guide,Took the test a while back using solely this book and the mail-in study guide that comes with registration for the exam. Ended up with a 97 on the test. Definetly worth the money.
1,Not Worth It!!!,"I just recently took the Suffolk County Exam last Saturday on the 9th of June, and this book was not at all helpful. The images are not clear among other things. FYI, the Suffolk County PD sends you test prep information prior to the exam (about 1 month ahead). Trust me this is all the help you will need. This book was a waste of my money!"
4,OK book,"Not my favorite Joni Hilton book, but it was OK. Good storyline and not boring, just not as interesting as some of her other books."
3,Not quite real enough,"This seems to be a marshmallow version of ""Angry Housewives Eating Bon-bons"" by Lorna Landvik, with even the same main characters, almost. The older woman of the bunch who loves her deceased husband and passes on advice; the fiery red-head who even has almost the same nickname (Ships/Slip); the say-it-straight-out, curvy, divorced one; the blonde, sweet natured devoted wife & mother; and the main character whose thoughts we get to know. I'm in the middle of it but debating on whether I want to finish it... the characters are a little too ""happy-valley"" for me, as is the writing, which is surprising, because I have really enjoyed all of Joni Hilton's other books. Maybe because I read those a long time ago when I was a little more bright-eyed and idealistic, lol!"
5,Collection Game for AoE,"This is by far one of the best pc game collection you could ever ask for! This is a dream come true for anyone who is a fan of these type games, and not just because it's cheap and that you can a great deal for. Highly recommended for anyone really though, so don't be hesitant in buying it!"
4,Age of Empires,"I truly enjoy playing this game. I really enjoy having the chance to play 3 different versions of the game, and can switch whenever I want. The game can be both easy or very challenging, and no two games will play out the same. Very good product."
4,"Great game, misleading photo","I love this game. I remember watching my dad playing it when I was a kid, and bought it for a decent price for everything you get, and I am very happy with it.My only complaint, and some may see it as petty, but I was very disappointed in the packaging. The photo shows a nice big box with stylish design, looking very epic. What I got was a very flimsy CD case containing the 3 discs, all of which fall out because some of the little clips that hold the discs in place had broken off.It was a bit of a let-down, but the games play great, so I can't complain too much."
4,I finally have then all :-),I do agree with the lot of you who say that the AOEI and Rome expansion are quite slow. I just didnt know how slow. It was has been difficult to play knowing how much faster it is to navigate AOEII and AOEIII.great game play and keeps you interested. Like I said now I'm on AOEIII War Chiefs and looking forward to AOEIII Asian Dynasties.
1,Does Not Work Well With Windows 7,I bought this at a Best Buy some time ago. It worked on my old XP computer. I recently upgraded to a Windows 7. This game does not work with Windows 7. It had problems ranging from mouse commands to colors.
1,Doesn't work,This game doesn't even load on your computer. This game is a rip off. You are better off buying Age of empires out right. I am sorry. This upset me and I love Age of empires! I have played them all.
4,Great game - Some multiplayer issues,"Overall the game is great to play in your pc, but if can play by internet it has some issues connecting to ESO (multiplayer server). Neverthless its a good game."
4,Age of Empires collectors edition (jewel case),I highly recommend these games if you are a stradegy nut. Althought the graphics and music are on the old side. The game holds up in the area of fun and addictive. It also ran very well on my computer for all the complaints I read before buying. I bought it after I playing Age of empires 3 and had to have the whole collection. Well worth the $10
3,"Good game, but not for windows vista.","This game is really good, but make sure you have a windows xp computer. Only one out of the three games works on windows vista."
4,A fun classic,"This game is so simple compared to games made today, but it will never stop being fun. It's fun, informative, and easy to play. I loved it when it first came out and just bought it again because I lost my copy."
4,AOE I & II Collections are Great,This is a great deal for the Age of Empires I and II collections. I bought this for a friend and the disks worked fine on his Windows XP SP2 system and the installation was flawless. I was already a fan of the games and believe that they are among the most fun to play (with AOE II The Conqueror's Expansion ranking the best on my list). The only downside is that this package is barebones and does not include the manual and other documentation that would normally accompany these games if you were to purchase them individually.
5,"Great game, cheap packaging","If you like Age of Empires 3 and never owned the original games, this is a great way to get them. All version (base game plus expansions) of AOE 1 and 2 come in the package, and you get it all for under $10.The only downsides are that you don't get any manuals or foldout tech tree documents that would have come with the original release of the games. The packaging is also a cheap single CD case with a swinging leaf inside to allow it to hold 2 CDs on the leaf and one behind it. The fingers holding the CDs broke shortly after openning the package, so I just put the CDs into a Music CD case instead.All in all, unless you are real picky about getting perfect packaging, this is a great deal."
4,top-of-the-line classic game,this game was my favorite growing up (the first one) and i still like it now. it's very dated but it still has fun factors when you just wanna get back to the basics.i would recommend this game for the great price it's at (i grabbed it for [...]).
1,Beware! My Discs Were Bad.,"I think I am an exception here, but my disc refused to load. I tried in three different CD/DVD drives on two different computers and this disc would spin up and...nothing. Dunno if it demagnetized due to old age or what. Disc looked 100% fine and was scratch-free, but I had to return it. Bought a similar Age Of Kings disc set here on Amazon and it worked 100% fine."
3,Doesn't work on windows 7,"For all that I've heard this is an excellent game, I can't say for myself because it won't work.Microsoft says it is compatible with 7 but I messed around and searched the web for fixes and I still haven't gotten it going. Some people said that if you change something in your registery it will work but as of yet no luck for me.If I get it working I'll update with the steps needed to do so."
4,"Great game, print your own manual","Here's a helpful note on the packaging: This set doesn't include the manual or technology tree fold-out. That's probaably why it costs less than the AoE 2 Gold Edition. If you like to have the tech tree (building and unit upgrades reference sheet) next to you when you play, you'll need to print your own. Just search online for ""Age of Empires II manual"" without the quotes and you'll find the PDF to download from Microsoft or you can look for a one-sheet PDF tech tree by someone named Nethog. Or you can fork out double the amount for the Gold edition, which has less software but printed manuals included.Other reviewers have said everything that needs to be said about the game itself. It's a pleasantly addictive sequel to Age of Empires."
4,Awesome,"The game is exactly as I expected. I was scared at first to buy it because I have Vista on my computer but it turned out it was compatable. Nothing funky to do with it, just put it in and there you go."
4,Two good games,"These games are good fun. The price is great for what you get, but the games show their age. They can't compare to modern games in their category, but are great to play especialy if you have a older computer."
3,"Well, at least the Age of Kings game works...","You all should know about the game play of these games from other reviews. I'll focus just on this package.I bought this for the Age of Kings and the AOK expansion pack -- I already have the Age of Empires: Gold Edition. So, it shouldn't matter that the version of AOE doesn't load on my computer (it freezes just as the load is about finished). I mean, I did get an AOK: Gold for a good price. But, I'm kind of sorry all the games included don't work."
3,Meh.,"Not much to say. Couldn't really get into it. Nowhere near as good as, say, Medieval Total War, when it comes to overall strategy and actual battles. Nowhere near as good as, say, StarCraft when it comes to real-time strategy. Nowhere near as good as any of the Civilization games when it comes to developing a civilization. It's basically so-so on all fronts. I can't handle newer games on my ancient PC, so I can't compare it to things like WarCraft."
1,bad disk wont install,Came seald but 2nd install disk age of empires 11 age of kings had a bad spot about the size of a dime and wont install. The 3rd disk had same spot but not as deep but dont do any good whith out the 2nd disk.
1,was fun years ago,games to old to be fun any more ... loved them when they first came out but now just too out of date
4,Good Buy,"Its a great deal for 3 games. The only one that I play is Conquerors, but you need age of kings II to play it. Its a great deal!"
3,"Old classics, but they are quite dated.","This game is an old favorite of mine and seemed ground breaking to me when they it was new, but by today's standards, the AI and unit tracking is horrible. Still very fun and addicting however. This boxed set is a great value."
2,Ever Heard Of Online Play?,"This game, as AoE is, is one of the best Strategy titles ever made for PC. I HATE this box set due to one reason:This CANNOT be used for Online play. It comes literally on 1 disk, and the disk doesn't count as any of the games alone. If you try to connect with a friend, it keeps asking for the disk to be inserted when it already is.As long as you have no friends to play this game with, go for it. Good deal for just playing I guess, but I admit that playing online is the main feature people should love (Seeing as how the computers literally suicide on missions without warning sometimes, and the difficulty only goes so high)."
2,Great deal for 4 games,"I've always loved AOE and for good reason!! This game is fun!And for those of you who are wondering if this works on Vista, yes it does. I didn't have any compatibility issues at all on my machine."
3,Pleasantly time consuming.,"Bought this game for a friend and played about 30 minutes, time consuming and helps to pass the day when there is nothing better to do. Cheat codes help with resources, makes winning a lot easier."
3,Good but does get a little monotonous!,"This is a very educational game and it does encourage critical thinking. The only problem I have with it is that despite the many scenarios, they all evolve around similar strategies. This makes it get a bit monotonous after a few conquest. The initial excitement soon fades, making it a bit difficult to see all scenarios through."
5,Age II FTW,"For anyone who doesnt know what this game is. It is possibly one of the most fun fts made to date. This game is quite old , but I still play it with many friends. For the price this is going for its an absolute steal pick it up and you wont regret it."
4,Age of Empires: The Granddaddy,"The Age of Empires series is in many ways the founding farther of RTS games. If you have never played the game before and are thinking of buying, don't expect command and conquer sort of graphics, because this game is now fairly old. If you have an appreciation for RTS and want to play where it all started, then give this game a go. The game play is addictive and fun and the scenario editor is really easy to use and top notch. The game is super easy to pick up and play and there are many different fun factions to play as. Well worth the money."
1,"Xp and Above, it will not work!","This product will not, I repeat, will not work on windows xp or above, waste of money unlessyou have an old 95 computer"
1,Age of Empires game,I have a windows 7 computer that is one year old and the game I got wouldn't work because it was too old. I tried everything to make it install on my computer. It never said on the description that it was not a windows 7 and instead it was windows 98. Very very frustrating.
2,where are the directions?,"No matter how hard we tried, when we were FINALLY able to get it to downloaded, we were not able to figure it out! And without any directions it is impossible! We are very disappointed because we were looking forward to learning the empires while we were playing this game!"
5,Great Buy. Works on Windows 7,"Overall it was pretty good buy. Worked on my Windows 7, if you're wondering. I didn't think it would but it did. This is a great buy for those that love the Age of Empire set. Brought back some good memories."
5,Peyton Manning Reebok Play Action Indianapolis Colts T-Shirt,Hubby was very happy with this gift our bedroom is loaded with colts everything and he has tons of clothes too
4,rough rider,"I am just at the beginning, but am enjoying the sections that I am reading..the material is giving me thought of how to enjoy my vacation"
5,A great lens at a great price,"I got this lens for a little over 200$, and it is definitely worth more. The images are crisp and clear, it focuses correctly and accurately, and seemingly at a shorter distance than what is published."
3,fits good,"the pic wasn't what i got. they need to update pic. fits good, looks good! did not come with the words"
1,Court Martialed,"I looked up Rockie Blunt because I saw his name on the History Channel's fabulous program World War II in HD. I recognized Mr. Blunt's name but couldn't put my finger on it.Of course! He was our local reporter and a jazz musician. Then I remembered this book and all the complaints.Well, I googled Roscoe Cosby Blunt and found that President Clinton pardoned him. Apparently, he was court martialed in 1945 for fraternization. I can't believe that after all these years of his reporting, writing books and now being featured on the History Channel that this has never been discovered. And yes, it is the same Roscoe Crosby Blunt from Shrewsbury, Mass.I haven't seen the episodes that he is in, but I am just stunned. I hope this doesn't ruin my viewing of this documentary event."
3,Well it is well written,"First let me say the book is rather well written and interesting. The author certainly saw his share of combat and deserves his due. Having said that though I must echo many of the sentiments of others expressed here that the author does not seem to realize that his thrill of looting, wandering off on his own, and perhaps outright goldbricking is not something of which to be proud. Perhaps those of us not there should not comment but I have read countless personal tales of soldiers in WW2 and this is the first one that left me less than impressed with the author. Perhaps Mr Blunt is just that, blunt and tells it like it was. I'll give him credit for that."
1,"""Rocky"" Blunt writes fiction","Reading ""Foot Soldier"" would be a laughing matter if it did not insult the guys who really fought WW11. His feats would have earned him decorations by the yard--yet he did not have any. Combat veterans fought for their buddies--yet Blunt doesn't mention but one. He personaly shot down a Messerschmit 109 and ""killed"" a King Tiger tank! What was ""Rockie smoking when he penned this book?"
1,"I have come back to clarrify, i wrote yesterday he was a gad","I thought overnight here i have been walking on numb feet for almost 60 years and have read his pipe smoking dreams, and in deference i left off my name well blunt i will be blunt, why did you write this junk around your travalogue? you shame the 84th.former gun cpl peter a. dattilo 3rd battalion 335th, do you really remember marche and rochfort? or some cellar"
5,Outstanding,This book was great. I could hardly put the thing down. Mr. Blunts explanation of his experiences were magnificent. Its hard to think of what these brave men dealt with. You can only imagine. With this book the only thing your missing is being there yourself.
1,Absoulty Aweful,"It was amazing when i read this, how self centered and morally wrong this man was. It makes me sick to my stumach to read it. This was nothing more then glorifing his looting and murdering in cold blood. If you have a chance skip this one and read somthing like ""Company Commander"" or ""Band of Brothers"" somthing worth while."
5,Great Book,"This was one of the best books that I have ever read. I would say that this book, in my opinion, was much better than ""Band of Brothers (I also gave that title five stars)."" The descriptions of life on the front line is truly amazing to read about. Blunt had an extremly interesting habit that was quite interesting to read about. The entire book was a narraitve. This is a great story about one man."
3,Ignore this and get the Season 1 dvd instead,"This dvd isn't so bad; but it's just the first 3 episodes of Season 1. The 'never seen before episode' is the 11th episode (the one with the Scottsman on the bridge), which is also on the Season 1 dvd. It's disappointing that they don't tell you that on the description anywhere, so for any of you who planned on getting both this and the Season 1 set - just get the Season 1 set by itself.Otherwise, this is a fine intro to Samurai Jack and is worth watching. I would rate the disc 4.5 out of 5 on its own."
1,Avoid if you buy season one as well,"Yes this DVD is nice, but all material also is included in Season one. So don't make the same mistake I did and avoid it if you are getting the first season. The movie is basically the first 3 episodes of season 1.As a standalone product I have no complaints if you have no interest in purchasing the series. Very stylized and entertaining. I just hate companies that rip you off by issuing the same thing as different titles."
3,Intro to the Story,"This is the story of the beginings of Samurai Jack (also on the 1st season DVD). I like the episodes of young Jack, however I think the best intro to the cartoon would be a later episode. These early episodes have an early timing, animation and story telling style that is not yet up to the level of the other episodes of the 1st season. You can really tell this when Jack first goes to the future and fights the robotic bugs. More importantly though I didn't see these episodes untill after I was a fan from later ones. I found that discovering the Samurai's past after I knew the character was presumably more exciting than the other way around. The DVD has some Cartoon Network online extras if that interests you. I have both this DVD and the 1st season, but there really isn't a need for this DVD unless you don't want the entire 1st season or if you just want this for the completeness of your collection."
4,Samurai Jack is great.,"I enjoy this cartoon, and this is a decent DVD, but apparently these episodes are included in season 1. I would recommend just getting that one instead of this."
5,Love Samurai Jack!,"Buy this and Season 1 of Samurai Jack. They aren't showing it on tv in the US anymore, so I plan to buy the series so we can see them all. There are some on the S1 DVD that we've not seen yet. And we only saw the Premiere movie once. So we look forward to seeing this again."
4,Bonus Episode Seen Before,"Just a warning that the DVD doesn't contain much ""never before seen"" material. The Bonus Episode is number XI, the first appearance of the Scotsman. (The box doesn't claim this is ""Never before seen""; that seems to be Amazon's mistake.)I think the documentary is the same one which ran after the Movie on Cartoon Network. The PowerPuff Girls Movie sneak peek is the same as on the ""Meet the Beat Alls"" DVD. It seems the only new material is an archive of line drawings. I can't try the DVD-ROM because I don't have a Windows machine.I'm still happy with my purchase because it was a great movie, but I'm disappointed that there wasn't much that was new."
1,wow!,"No cartoon is as hardcore as Samurai Jack; it's a two thumbs-up masterpiece from the genious of Owen Lewis, and the other guy. Buy now!!!"
1,Same as season 1,"Was not properly advertised, therefore I bought Season 1 twice. The movie is also Season 1."
3,Good Origin,Samurai Jack - The Premiere Movie focuses mainly on the origin of our favorite Samurai and while it was enjoyable it did feel just a little slow. Overall if you just want to see if you might like Samurai Jack pick it up. I'm sure it will hook you.
4,great animation,"stumbled onto samurai jack one night on TV and have been hooked since. unique storytelling, bizarre plots and some of the coolest animation around...very much looking forward to this release..check out the cartoon network to catch this showyoull get hooked too"
3,ok!,it's an ok toy... my lovebirds don't go feverishly there to shred it like other toys they have in a cage... it's a good toy to have it in... sometimes they are hanging on it :)
5,Bag,Thank you so much. I Love the bag. Going to order one for my husband and my two daughters.Melissa
4,Good Buy!,The bag is constructed well and has held up with steady usage. We are pleased with its multiple pockets for storage and organization. Nice bag!
2,Jump Start Preschool is much better.,"I purchased this hoping that it was just as good as Jumpstart Preschool. My daughter did not care for this one. The music is not that great and the games are not as fun. The graphics are not even as good as the Jumpstart Preschool. I guess we will keep it but she does not play with it much. She asks for Jumpstart Preschool, ""check out the school that's real cool."""
4,Worth the money,"I only had a few minutes to evaluate this product before giving it as a gift, so take this with a grain of salt. Pros: cute characters, bright colors, cute songs, seemed to be a good variety of activities for learning numbers, letters, colors, etc., and basic dexterity skills. I was pleasantly surprised. Cons: the only thing I noticed was that there were no ""menus"" per se - it wasn't easy to figure out how to exit a section or skip to another one, or skip over the opening song and get right to the game. I did figure it out, eventually. This product is certainly worth the under-$10 price tag. Seems like quality went into it."
2,"Not as good as I""d hoped","We had this CD for my 9yr old when he was little. Ended up throwing it away because it kept getting stuck in the middle of play. We liked some of the games in it, so I purchased this again for my 2yr old in the newer updated version thinking it would be better. The reviews I read stated that even if your little one cant use a mouse, just the keyboard will make things work. Well, dont know about anyone elses 2yr old, but mine is punch happy on the keyboard and kept locking things up and exiting the game if he hit any other key besides an alphabet letter. So once again, disappointed in this software. Also purchased the Reader Rabbit and am very happy with that one. My little one likes it better too as it has more activities."
3,Jump start toddlers,"I wished that it would allow more hands on than have the animated characters do most of the work, for instance recognizing shapes."
3,"basic, out of date","This is not bad software, but it is old and out of date which is reflected in the quality of the graphics, sound, and animation. It's still a viable set of activities for toddlers, but there are better ones. For example, the fisher-price.com website has a free ""ABC Zoo"" with better graphics and sound than the one on this CD. The same is true for the musical instrument activity. Besides that, it is short on activities overall compared to the latest Reader Rabbit Toddler. Adventure Workshop Toddler, which includes Reader Rabbit and 3 other CD's has several dozen more activities, all with superior sound and graphics. For the value offered, Jump Start would be a good deal at $3."
5,Jumpstart in the Classroom,This software is used in a self contained classroom with Autistic students. They all love this software and I need another copy of it.
2,really simplistic,this was really simplistic and my toddler did not enjoy it. the program does most of the work so its not teaching as much as I would like. I would recommend for someone just starting to let their kids use the computer but it will not hold their attention for long. reader rabbit for baby and toddler is a much better investment.
4,Good,"I like it, feed rate is good.. but a little bit too much heavy lol.Whatever you are not a pussy, are you!?"
3,Could've been alot better,"First off my son and I love Kong. We've collected all the new toys, played the Xbox game to death, Kong's death that is, and watched the movies and new cartoons to the point that my wife is ready for the loony bin. That said I feel this DVD was a lost opportunity. The shows themselves are wonderful and Tom of T.H.U.M.B. while not that funny is an amusing little show to watch between episodes of Kong. The problem is there appears to be no order. The pilot show is the last one on the disk and the editing is horrible. I just wish more time and effort would be put into DVDs such as these even if it means spending a little more money."
4,Gillette is sorely needed in today's music world,"Where is she?!Anyway, Sex Tonight is a great song: Good beats, nice sound, and funny/sexy lyrics. Although, I prefer Gillette's raunchier music, this one is still sufficient.My one caveat would be the minimal lyrics sung during the song. There is seemingly a minute of random beats played over and over until Gillette says a few words--repeat and do it all over again. But, this isn't anything new as she's done it with all her other songs.5/5 stars"
5,MY GIRLFRIEND AND I LOVE IT!!!,This is a song that you can move to all night long. It's the ultimate club song. Listening to the rhythm puts you in a trance.
5,Gershwin comes to life,"Joshua Bell really swings in this rendition of Gershwin's work. He makes the violin cry during version of Porgy and Bess, bringing out the emotion of the work. John Williams takes a turn on this CD as both the conductor and pianist and seems to have fun with both roles. Old piano rolls made by George Gershwin are even used to have George accompany Joshua and the London SO."
4,Bell & Gershwin,"Two of my faves, George Gershwin and Joshual Bell -Can't beat that!Also, ""Porgy"" is a fave opera... so three out of three isn't bad!"
1,Totally dissatisfied with the product,Lost my Color Merridian overboard and had to replace the GPS. When I recieved the new GPS I called Magellan to get a new unlock code so I could load the charts on my replacement GPS. I was informed I would have to purchase a new bluenav CD since they only issue one unlock code with no exceptions. Well my exception is I will never buy another Magellan product Hardware / Software. As for the replacement Color Merridian it is being returned today. In the future I will purchase Garmin.
1,Awkward and out of date,The map is old and there is no way to update the information annually with published changes. Obtaining an unlock code is an involved process with a long wait for technical support by phone.
1,Abysmal Customer Service,"An ungodly painful process made obtaining maps from this software a nightmare. If you have an older product, which can mean something as ancient as two years most of the techs are clueless. This may be true only for marine products, but I have definitely sworn off all Magellan and Thales products as a result."
1,blasphemous,"this cd is pure trash, just look at the name, and shes practically naked on the cover. It disgusts me that the tramp she is would actually go after something like x-mas, i mean come on she just made this cd to get people mad at her again. This is dirty ol' man music."
5,pretty good!=0),"This is a great album! Christina's voice is even better than on her debut album! Probably the most memorable songs are tracks 1, 2, 3 and 6. I love the part in O, Holy Night where she recites the Lord's Prayer! It just sounds so beautiful! These are the special times is a great remake of Celine Dion's original. The only songs that get on my last nerve are Merry Christmas baby, and especially Xtina's Xmas! I really don't understand the point of xtina's Xmas at all! Honestly, I think Silent Night should have taken the place of this filler track."
3,"Good, but problems","I went to buy this CD the first day it came out. I didn't know about duets with Billy Preston or Dr. John...They weren't on my CD. My CD has the original Chestnuts Song, The Holiday Mix of that, then the Xtina's Xmas, O Holy Night, These are Special Times, etc. No performing live for the President, no Silent Night in Spanglish, no Thunderpuss Remix. I would've liked it on my CD. If you want to know where I got mine from, I got it from Target. It does come with an enhanced CD feature, not sure what it is yet, though."
2,strictly for teenyboppers,"This is a typical Christina CD...same beat as her other records just Christmas lyrics. Should be a wonderful seller for the 13-14 year olds, but not worth listening to if you truly want some traditional Christmas musc. Christina has an amazing vocal range as evidenced by her blues rendition of an Etta James song in her concert. One of these years she will grow up and use the full potential of her voice. This was NOT it."
2,Her kind of Christmas is not my kind,"Christina's Christmas CD was quite a disapointment to me.I got it expecting a great CD for Christmas and what I got was over-produced R+B pop.Christina did not put the effort she ususally puts into her music.The classic Christmas songs were good,but the rest was pure crap.Some I don't think should be considered Christmas songs.Christina needs some lesons from Mariah on how to make an excelent Christmas CD,then hers would have been way better."
5,"Great Voice, Great Music, Great Christmas Gift!",Christina Aguilera has a fabulous voice and really puts you in the holiday spirit with this Christmas album. She sings some of the classics but also has a few of her own. I strongly recommend this album!
3,"Lovely voice, but...","I am a big Christina Aguilera fan. As much as I love her though, I must say that this Christmas CD is way overdone. This is not what Christmas music is supposed to be, with all the shouting and melisma. Christmas music should be calming and soothing. This is not."
2,Get This Girl A Songwriter Fer Gods' Sakes,"I bought this in a haze of holiday optimism, having heard Ms. Aguilera knock my socks off dueting with Tony Bennett on a television tribute show. There is no denying that the girl can sing. Unfortunately, what she sings here is banal at best, and downright irritating at worst--lots of gratuitous squealing. It's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity. I reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age. Maybe I just don't get it. Then again, maybe it's just not there for me to get."
2,Not for everyone.,"I purchased this CD from Amazon[.com] as soon as it came out. Having it around for 3 Christmases now, I forgot how bad I thought it was until I popped it in one evening just before Christmas (this year) and listened all the way through.Some reviewers are praising this CD, and if their ears are pleased by it I respect that. I found it very hard to listen to. In other reviews, you will hear words like ""overdone"" and ""excessive trilling"" and these are understatements. Most of the songs are butchered almost beyond recognition, and this is disappointing because I find this artist talented and with much potential (though her image has been compromised recently).For the layman...say there were a few bars with 10 notes written. Christina will instead sing 40 notes from squeaky high to tenor range. If you like this sort of thing, buy it. If you like things more traditional or just a little creativity, you won't like it. There is too much ""creativity"" here."
2,Noooo!,"This is a terrible album! Do not buy it. I LOVE Christina, I have all her CDs. But this is a mess. I was so mad the first time I heard this, she butchers every song on it. If you want to hear the classics done right, don't buy this CD. It may be her kind of Christmas, but It's definitely not mine!"
1,Why can't I Give this CD zero stars?,"Sorry to say this but this CD stinks badly. even though I do not have ityet I listened to previews on some of her songs on her xmas CD and there bad bad, real bad.And just to think that Christina is a good singer , Idon't think that anymore after I find that Christina sings Celine Dion's these are the special times song and o holy night song!!Please do not buy this CD it's a waste of money!Christina can't sing!P.S.If you want a xmas CD go out and buy Celine Dion's xmas CD, it's much better."
1,Terrible!,"Yuck! Every song in this album sounds like she's more concerned with the notes she's singing rather than what she is singing about. There is no feeling anywhere in here. I looked. It's all about her voice which, albeit good, ruins every song by making it oh so terribly heavy. Go get Jewel's Christmas CD...that's how it should be done."
2,Eh - I'll pass next time,"I'm a huge Christina fan. There's no arguing this girl's got talent. So I was sadly disappointed when her Christmas album was just filled with ""bee bops"" and ""skee dos"" - completely over the top, unwarranted. She doesn't sing any of the songs, but rather ""ooohs"" and ""ahhhs"" through them all. By the time I got to the third track (I tried to sit through each song, really I did! I WANTED TO LOVE this album), I just couldn't stand it anymore. I had to take it out of my CD player. Disappointment."
1,No Christmas in this one at all......,"but sounding more like ""I can do better (worse) than Mariah Carey"". Like no old classic Christmas song (that I enjoy thouroughly) goes to extremes like this. On the bright side however, my hometown's Christmas station, I would somtimes hear ""This Christmas"" which sounds like the most decent sounding one (cause there is no harsh screeching).The best covers on ""Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire""1. Nat King Cole - A timeless classic, play it every Christmas!2. Al Jarreau3. Gloria Estefan4. Luther Vandross...Dead Last. Christina Aguilera - what's up with the screeching!I wish these now-a-day pop stars who sing Christmas songs sing it with their heart, as opposed to just doing it for just the money. Christmas is a time for giving and celebrating Jesus's birth, not showing off."
1,Oh Holy Night says it all,"I know that I used to have a great respect for Christina. Hey, the girl can sing. But this Christmas CD is the most self-glorifying, insincere and irreverend one I have ever heard. You'd think that, ya know, the girl can sing, she'll hit the high note in Oh Holy Night and it will be all pretty. I reccommend downloading the MP3 first, ladies and gents. It's convoluted, strange and painful to listen to. It starts off with the ""ooooo oh yeah""s. It takes a million years for her to sing the first verse because of all the oo-ing. She hits the high note and all is happy. Then comes the strangest rendition of The Lords Prayer. It sounds so insincere and awful with her oo-ing and ah-ing in the background. After that, it's a huge ballad. Then this strange Gospel/Jazz piano comes in and Christina starts to scream. It sounds like it should be played in Las Vegas or something. She's basically saying ""Look at me! I can sing! Oh yeah, Christmas is...good. But I can sing!"" DON'T BUY IT"
2,"Good, but not Christmassy...","Though Christina has once again proved her superior vocal style and talent, she has not pleased me in the Christmas department. Her vocals are absolutely amazing, but honestly, think...could you picture listening to her wail at the top of her lungs on ""This Year"", or ""Christmas Time"", or how she literally butchers such classics as ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" and ""O Holy Night"" on Christmas morning during gift exchange? Sorry, but I can't. The best song in my opinion on this CD is ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas."" It's more simple than the other tracks on this album, though she does modernize it a bit with her wide voice range and wonderfully frilly slurs and trills. Bottom Line: Good for the pop genre, not Christmas."
2,BORING,I am a christmas album collector and i must say Christina has a great voice but she doesn't know how to use it. She wails when the song is supposed to be soft and is soft when she should be louder. She goes from high to low voices to often. Plus the arrangements of the songs are so boring. I think the producer was depending a little to much on christina's voice to carry the album and decided to blow off the background music. If you want a great christmas CD check out JEWEL's Joy: a Holiday Colection. It is my favorite of all time. Not only is Jewel's voice beautiful but the arrangements by producer Arif Marden are amazing as well. Sorry to all the Cristina fans but she needs to stick to regular pop albums.
1,Horrible,After reading alot of the reviews on this board I am convinced that most of the people writing reviews are Christina's die hard fans. I personally have never bought any of her other cds and after having heard this will never buy another cd of hers again. It is the least sincere christmas album I have ever heard. I have heard Christina say many times how she wants everybody to know that she has true talent and can sing.First of all I think one of the things she has forgotten is that songwriters have written these songs. The songs have lyrics.
4,This Is Definitely My Kind Of Christmas,"This was a great cd. Christina's voice is absolutely beautiful on all of the ballads. The more upbeat songs are very catchy and definitely help put you in the holiday spirit. And the classics she remade like ""This Christmas"" are very well done, the originators would be proud of her. I love it and definitely think it should be in everyone's holdiay collection."
1,Wouldn'tbuythiscrapevenifitwasfreeandshewasnakedonthecover,"Get a clue. We need to stop this whoremusic genre. I admit that I liked the ""Beautiful"" single but only because it wasn't forced. I was in a Walgreens and someone triggered the singing Santa in order to drown out her craperversion of The Christmas Song.I have heard better singing/moaning in porno movies. The only thing worse would be if Nelson, NKOTB, Menudo, and the Great-Great Grandchildren of the Osmonds got together for a day long Christmas benefit in my basement while dwarfs forced broken glass shards into my hindquarters."
5,"A great, catchy, pop Christmas album","This CD is what Mariah Carey's Christmas CD tried to be...and failed. Christina's powerful voice and soulful interpretations will stir you, and her faster tracks will have you bopping all over the room. I have this in my car and I listen to it year round. My very favorite song is a slow, soulful, bluesy rendition of ""Merry Christmas Baby"" that really showcases her vocal ability. I also love her version of ""O Holy Night"" -- a difficult song to sing well, which starts out as a traditional carol, goes thru a spoken prayer (that prayer is my LEAST favorite part of the album), and ends when she brings in the choir. You want to get up and sing Hallelujah with this song!"
4,Better Than I Expected,"I must admit that don't really like Christina Aguilera, but some of my friends do and they were talking about how great this CD was, so I figured I would buy it and see if it was all they had hyped it up to be, and it was better than I expected. Just don't waste your time listening to X-tina's X-mas. I had to take a star off just because of that song!"
5,Beautiful Christmas music with a gospel touch,Christina's voice is great and she puts a lot of soul into these songs. I enjoy listening to this CD even when it's not Christmas time! Her backup singers and musicians are very good too. I highly recommend it.
2,Wasting Talent,It's too bad that Christina Aguilera is wasting her considerable talent on mediocre arrangements and superfluous vocal histrionics such as are displayed on this album. The sense of the songs are lost and musical line is sacrificed for vocal fireworks that are not in keeping with the style or mood. It's frustrating to hear such a good voice not being used to its maximum potential. I was very disappointed.
2,Come on Christina...,"First, let me just start off by saying that Christina Aguilera possesses a beautiful voice. Whether she knows how to use it is another matter. Some of the songs on this album are startlingly beautiful. Those being the simpler tunes. The ones she goes insane on, riffing her voice for all it's worth, are the ones that drag it down. Her voice would be SO much better suited to a simpler style. Playing tricks with your voice does not make you a good singer. Apparently no one has taught her this. So all in all...a poor album, with massive potential. Come on Christina we all know you can do better."
3,okay,"""Christmas Time"" is really catchy, and you could almost call it a radio hit-it gets a lot of airplay during the holidays over here. But the rest of this is kind of your typical Christmas stuff. Christina's voice is beautiful, but I'll stick with her addictive original creations, thanks."
3,Nice Christmas Album,This is an okay Christmas album. I love the 2 new songs that Christina did. I cannot say that for the rest of the album. It could have been better if she didn't over do it. Her oversinging takes away and distracts from the songs. It gets rather annoying after a track or 2.
3,Christmas Fav,"This CD is okay, but nothing to write home about. I do not know what I was expecting, but this was not it."
1,Not My Kind of Christmas,"If it was possible to give this CD no stars, I would have. I am not a fan of Ms Aguilera. I don't like her voice and the way she uses it nor do I care for her image. She ruined the Diane Warren song, ""These Are The Special Times"". Celine's version is much better. Christina is a white singer trying to sound black with all of those endless and needless emblishments and constant trilling. Nothing is more annoying. Can't she sing any song normally? I wouldn't describe her voice as beautiful...all she does is scream. She is a teeny bopper pop tart just like Britney Spears, whom I equally despise. If you want to hear a good Christmas album, buy Celine's ""These Special Times"", Mariah's ""Merry Christmas"" or Jewel's holiday CD."
5,Christimas with Christina,Christina's voice just keeps getting better and better and she goes all out with this CD. Christina has the voice of an angel. I can't wait for her follow-up to her debut album. You go girl!.
1,She can have her Christmas.....,This cd is nothing more than more product of a singer who wants to have more exposure than Britney and fails! I'm ashamed that my generation buys crap like this and thinks that wearing less clothes is what it takes to be a good singer.It's not!! Grow up!!
1,Making more money,"Another Christmas CD.. I like CA, but why this stupid thing? Next time she'll gonna sing in german or french... We'll, she's blond- that's maybe the game. Blondes have more fun- but maybe not more brain???"
1,What I Never Want for Christmas!,"Thank you Miss Aguilera for creating the worst Christmas album ever. Apparently you can play this one during the Halloween season as well, because it is the most sacriligious piece of [singing] I've ever heard. The irony of hearing [her] sing ""Oh, Holy Night"" does have it's momentary guilty pleasure, but after that it's all down hill. Yes, we do know you can sing Christina, so stop trilling every note. Perhaps you were never taught that it's those that sing the most purely and with simplicity that truly take away our breath. ..."
2,She can do better. YOU can do better (in buying another album),"I'm going to echo one of the popular complaints about this album. As fantastic as her voice is (and she really was ""the best"" of that group that came up from the Mickey Mouse Club), Christina seems to always be trying to prove that she can sing. On her original albums, it's not AS big of a problem for me (do you, Christina), but on a Christmas album, it's just unnecessary. The over-the-top runs kill most of the songs that should be pleasant to listen to. O Holy Night is my absolute favorite Christmas carol and I couldn't sit through her version. I had high expectations of it. She is a BIG voice, but she doesn't seem to reign it in for these songs. Same for The Christmas Song. I can deal with changing the arrangements, those can be nice changes sometimes. But I can't take the oversinging. The only song that is ""reasonable"" for me is Hark the Herald Angels Sing. Everything else is really forgettable."
2,Not really a Christmas Feel,"I would like to start off saying I am truly an admirer of Christina. There has never been a singer who has WOW'd me with the depth of their voice, nor the beauty of their face as much as Christina has done over the years. She is truly a powerhouse. Unfortunately, because of the power of her voice, it just doesn't seem like a Christmas Album(or rather the Christmas I am use to anyways). Her version of ""This Christmas"" is the reason I purchased this album and I have to say I love that track but the majority of the other songs are really over the top and just leave me feeling as though I am listening to the R&B radio station, not a Christmas Album. A great singer, a great beauty but she really needs to tone it down in the proper places. I believe this girl could become the next Barbara Steisand of this generation. If you like traditional Christmas music, this album is not for you."
1,Like nails on a chalkboard,"This album is over-the-top Christina Aguilera. If you're looking for beautifully sung holiday classics, look elsewhere. Her vocal gymnastics come across as WAY too much, and at times even un-melodic and screechy. The Mel Torme classic The Christmas Song is just butchered with long unnecessary runs that are all over the place and hard to listen to. If you enjoy the sound of cats fighting you may enjoy this album. My advice: save your money on this one."
1,I can review this album with 2 words:,"Self-Indulgent. Okay, Simon Cowell is someone who uses that phrase a lot, but I always agree with him when he does. This time I'm using it because I simply hate to see the waste of a set of pipes like Christina's but the girl needs to be taken down a few notches. I saw her sing a duet with Brian McKnight where she completely showboated the entire song and the poor guy had to grab her hand to get her to calm the freak down. Nope. I'm done with her for at least a decade. Maybe some maturity with bring her down to earth."
3,Good.. but not Great,"Christina's christmas album is enjoyable..but not all that great. The first song is a catchy song and was played on the radio during the holidays. Christina does have a good voice, but most of the time she over sings her songs which just kills it. If you hear it on a CD player your ears will start to hurt if you have it on too loud. If Britney put out a Christmas record, I'm sure that it would be much better than this. I prefer Britney's voice to Christina's any day because she has a good voice and doesn't over sing. My Kind Of Christmas will bring satisfaction to mostly Christina fans."
3,yucky,"i'm normally a huge fan of christmas cds but this one just wasnt that good. christina has a BEAUTIFUL voice and she shows it well on this cd but the songs werent that great. the only ones i really did like were have yourself a merry merry christmas, this christmas, and angels we have heard on high. other then that the cd kind of .... i dont recommend this one at all not unless you're a big christina fan!"
1,COMPLETLY FALSE,"Christina Aguilera is a very false girl. She does not have her own sound, particulary on this album. Christina TRIES to over sing every one in the industry. She obviously thinks she on a scale with Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, ETC. The girl should steer clear from the extremly high octaves (sounds awful), and hit high notes occasionally (when her troat is not strained.) I for one, think she should stick to her pop (white) roots and, leave the classic christmas songs where they belong."
2,Dissapointing,"Since Christina has an excellent voice, I was expecting a mature Christmas album from her. However, although her voice still sounds excellent, every song has a fast pop or hip hop background to it. There is pretty much nothing on the album that has a real Christmas feel, and you would think everything is just average pop music unless you listened to the lyrics and realized they were about Christmas. I still respect Christina's vocals, but I was expecting something more grown up."
2,indescribable.,"First, if you would like to hear the equivalent of Christina Aguilera's Christmas collection, I suggest you listen to the last 20 minutes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Pure SCREAMING. Second, if you purchase this for your kid for Xmas, I suggest you pick up a nice pair of new eardrums to go along with it."
1,Thank God I Didn't Buy This Crap,"I'm so happy I didn't buy this album. I was over my friends house, and he purchase this cd. He was telling me how AWFUL this album was. I just couldnt believe it, so I told him let me listen to it. I played ""My Kind Of Christmas"" and to sum it up in one word. It's TERRIBLE, total waste of money. There is no reason to buy this christmas cd. I wouldnt recommend it its CRAP!"
1,A Stretch That Fails,"What on earth is this collection!?! Aguilera's ""My Kind of Christmas"" fails horribly with a voice and arrangements that are neither pleasant to listen to nor successful in their attempts to instill the spirit of the season. It's a complete rip-off. You'd be better off listening to a cat in heat."
2,"We know you can sing Christina,but Sometimes Less is More","Like Barbra Streisand says about singing,sometimes Less Is More,and Christina puts too much on everyone of these Christmas Classic's.""Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas""and ""The Christmas song"" is ruined by so many cord changes on every line.Just sing the song Christina the way it was written.Even the album cover.This looks like a cover Madonna used in the early 90's in her wild days.I could just picture Christina singing ""O Holy Night,"" in church wearing this outfit."
1,Not my kind of Christmas,"I've been very impressed with Ms. Aguilera's vocal talents since I first heard them on The Mickey Mouse Club years ago, however this CD is ridiculously overdone. While I am all for artists making song their own, this just seems a way for her and her producers to show off vocal talents while butchering classic Christmas songs. After listening to the first five tracks in complete disapointment I had hoped Oh Holy Night would be of some quality. The beginning was lovely. Using her wondrous voice to accent this songs wonderful writing. Then ruining this beautifully haunting piece with what seems to be becomming her trademark 5 million unneccesary vocal slides. Hopefully she will grow out of this need as Mariah Carey has seemed to do since her first three Albums or so. Bottom line is I would return this CD if the store would let me."
2,Disappointing,"When I first saw this album in the store, I was very excited to hear what Christina could do with these Christmas works. I am a classical singer, and Christina is one of the few pop singers I can stand because I think her talent and musicicality are very impressive. Upon finally listening to the album, I became very frustrated. She has a beautiful voice and I found myself shouting at the speakers, ""stop that!"" She would never hold a note out past a beat and a half in the beautiful ""Oh Holy Night."" Instead she had to improvise runs for every single note. She never paid any attention to line or the beauty of the actual written music. She just tore through it without really singing the songs. For me, this was very disappointing and frustrating from a singer, who I feel, is better. If you're looking for a Christmas album of beauty and enjoyment of holiday music, I suggest Barbra Streisand's classic one and Jewel's collection. Very artistic, moving and beautiful."
1,Tired of the vocal gymnastics,"Christmas music should be many things: happy, simple, somber, reflective, beautiful, and above all, singable. Every song has its own character. But I found her renditions of the songs on this CD nothing short of a root canal without anesthesia. The music was so irritating to me that I turned it off and gave the CD to my niece. Christina Aguilera definitely has a great vocal talent, but it increasingly seems that artists like this are constantly trying to see who can hit more notes in a three-second sequence than they are interested in trying to put their heart into the music they're singing. I call it ""vocal gymnastics."" Another reviewer mentions ""less is more"" and in this case, I wholeheartedly agree."
1,"Caught up in celebrity, instead of music.","I will be the first to say that Christina Aguilera has a gift. Her voice is quite powerful and very versatile. However, this album is a blatant example of how she can take a standard song and transform it into something that leaves me unable to comprehend the words. I have always thought that the biggest reason that Christina sings, is to hear herself. This album does not invite nor invoke any spirit of Christmas or the frame of mind that is associated with it. It is basically a 'look what I can do that you can't' album that fails in every aspect. Whitney Houston is known to do the same kind of thing during her performances, but her albums tone that down enough for the listener to enjoy and revel in her mastery. This album makes no attempt to do that. It is an album that Christina made for Christina, and not one that is meant to be 'shared' as Christmas albums with standards should."
2,"4.1, 3.3, 3.9, 3.9, 3.7","This album is a big disappointment, as if somebody set the switch on ""Whitney"" and just left it there, results be damned.It's one thing when vocal flourishes add to the emotion of a song; it's another when they're just there. There are so many vocal gymnastics on this record that I'd guess Christina had to visit a chiropractor when the recording sessions were finished.That said, there are three songs on this album that turned out reasonably well. ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" has some of the gymnastics, but it does have the benefit of Dr. John, so it is an entertaining reading of the song. ""This Christmas"" is given a relatively straightforward reading, though Alexander O'Neal's 1988 version (from his ""My Gift To You"" album) is still the best. ""The Christmas Song"" appears in two versions - a straight rendering of the song, and a remix featuring a pleasing 70's-style disco groove.The rest of the album is superfluous; it really would have made a better EP."
1,She loves her voice,This CD is a total bomb. CA begins each song with a roller coaster of ooo-ing and ah-ing of her voice and it takes an average of 28.2 seconds from the point she starts singing until she actually utters a word. Very unimaginative. I have about 150 Christmas music CDs and this one will fit in bottom 20 %.
2,What a disappointment!,"I was so excited when I heard Christina Aguilera was releasing a Christmas CD! I own her debut album, and I was impressed with her singing abilities, so I decided to try her Christmas CD. I looked at the track listing on this site, where I purchased the CD, and it looked quite promising, so I purchased it.The disapointment began when I realized the tracks posted do not match up to those on the actual CD (for example, I was expecting ""Silent Night,"" because it was listed on the website, but somehow is not on the CD itself.)I decided to listen to it anyway, and was shocked to hear how much pop was incorperated into the traditional Christmas carols! As a teenager, I do like pop in certain contexts, but Christmas carols such as ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" are not not, in my opinion, an appropriate context. I believe this could have been a much better CD, given Ms. Aguilera's obvious talent, and it was a sore disappointment to me.My advice: save your money. It's not worth it."
5,One of the best Christmas albums around; a must have album!,"Christina Aguilera has proved herself to be strong and ready to do anything with her new Christmas Album 'My Kind Of Christmas'. With many best loved and traditonal christmas songs such as 'The Christmas Song', 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' with other songs such as 'Oh Holy Night' in a jazzed up version. But she has proved her musical talent by putting some of her own songs on their such as 'This Christmas' and 'Christmas Time'. The album contains a mix of jazz and soul, it will definitely put you in the festive mood or if you want something a little faster or something to dance too you can always listen to 'The Christmas Song' (Holiday Remix)."
1,Great Artist - Wrong Type of Music,"I love to listen to Christina Aguilera, most of the time. I'm glad that I listened to her Christmas album before I purchased, which I did not. Could hardly recognize the songs as Christmas songs. Too much roller coaster of her voice. The music was definitely wrong. Sorry Christina, stick to your kind of music."
1,Wretched,"I listened to 5 of her songs on Pandora radio from this album - its truly awful. Completely overdone and super-saturated with impossible notes and rifts. I think Christmas songs should be able to be sung along with...forget it with this album...its not about the Christmas Season, but about Christina. Completely over indulgent, I couldn't event hum along to these melodies. I hope she matures out of the ""give-em-all-I-got"" stage soon - I love her smooth tones and clear voice, but its not present on this album. She screeches, rifts, and gravelly moans her way through the ruination of every Christmas song I love - Just a bad album!"
2,Bad...,"Let me just say that this is a very un-original and boring Christmas album. There are just two songs on here that I really enjoy, but the rest are over-produced and sound horrible. A much better choice for a holiday album would be Mariah Carey's beautiful and stunning ""Merry Christmas."" Don't waste your money on ""My Kind of Christmas."""
4,Xtina gives us a Merry Chritmas,"Christina shows off her undeniably awesome vocals on her Christmas Album. The album is defintiely a contemporary one, so if you're looking for traditional, skip over this one. Other than that, the new songs, varying arrangements, and powerful vocals leaves you Christina fans completely satisfied. Christina incorporates some of her RnB flavors into many of her songs, and her rendition of ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" with Dr. John proves she's got soul as well. Of course, even as a hard-core Christina fan, I sometimes find her vocal soarings sometimes out of place and a little too much. I would love to hear a song where she's not belting every note."
4,GREAT VOICE!,"There's no doubting the fact that Christina Aguilera has one of the most amazing voices anyone has ever heard. HOWEVER she does show off a little too much on this album. There are many unnecessary trills she adds in every now and then...well more like very often, and sometimes it just doesn't fit. Don't get me wrong, she sounds AMAZING, but showing off too much isn't a good thing. Overall, though, the CD is great. My favorite track is ""The Christmas Song"". All the trills in there are amazing! I only wish she had put more original songs in there instead of doing so many classics, but that's just my opinion. If you're thinking of buying this album, do it! She has a great voice and the songs sound great. Even the classics are slightly different in the way she sings them. This CD is a must-have for any Christina fan!! Enjoy!"
5,The Best of the Best1,"Christina has an amazing voice, and this CD is proof. On ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"", she belts out an excellent ballad. These are the type of songs I love to hear by Christina. Also, ""Christmas Time"" is an excellent track as well. It has a good RnB flavor to it. It definetly has single potential. All of the tracks on this cd are great in my opinion. There is something here for everyone. No matter how old or young you are."
3,Christina Lacks the SPIRIT,"well I don't know about you guys, and how you define a Christmas album. But Christina's Christmas album just lacks the spirit of christmas,I mean a christmas album should put you in the mood for christmas right??? but this CD is just like a normal POP ALBUM...but there are some good songs in this album like, These Are The Special Times...and I didn't really like her version of O Holy Night, dunno why but Mariah Carey and Barry White's versions are the best ones that I've ever heard...And Christina just screams...i mean wats up with that?? well all i can say is if u want a really classic christmas album, that puts u in the christmas spirit...get Celine Dion's and Mariah Carey's christmas album....well christina ur x-mas album is not that bad,but its still not good!!!"
4,Antony - Haunting,"Saw him perform on the I am Your Man Leonard Cohen Bio-Pic and was intrigued by voice and style. Artist has great, haunting falsiccato voice and his songs evoke a great sense of pain and confusion in his life. A must listen (intently) to."
4,Bird soars,This album has had the same emotional impact on me that Otis Redding's track Sitting by the Dock of the Bay had on me 40 years ago. The allusions by other reviewers to Nina Simone and Nick Cave are accurate. I would ask the author of the August 4th one star review to give this CD another listen. I am very glad I bought this recording. At the right time and in the right atmosphere it is a sublime musical experience.
1,You've got to be kidding!,"This guy's vocals make Tiny Tim sound like Dean Martin in comparison. Please hand me a bucket to throw up in! If this guy can get a recording contract with this mess, then it gives me new hope for myself..........or not."
1,outrageous reviews,"If I was deaf, and I read Antony's lyrics, I would assume that this cd was a joke.""And still you're coaxing meTo come on out and liveWell I'm a crippled dogI've got nothing to give""I would also assume that antony was a tormented pre-teen.Now if I was miraculously cured of my hearing-impairment, and I heard Antony's music, the subsequent fit of laughter would probably kill me."
2,"Flavour of the Month, like DFA: 1979","""Yes, this album isn't for those used to top 40""Just because someone finds the overly syrupy, oh-so-tired coy shy meek morrissey trip a little more than past its due date, doesn't necessarily mean they listen to Black Eyed Peas.Furthermore, I've listened to this album in passing (I skimmed through it) and there was nothing engaging about it for me.. that's usually a bad sign in my books, as I always give most albums a few shots (ie: Fiery Furnaces - Blueberry Boat) and let them grow on me. Well, I've tried and tried... if it ain't love at first sight, just move on.Hey, personally call it a phase but I'd much rather put on some music where it sounds like the band members have grown a pair, Boris? Deerhoof? Boredoms? hell, even Xiu Xiu manages to prove engaging AND emotionally genuine."
2,Bryan Ferry did it before and much better,"I was taken aback hearing this for the first time. Judging from the voice, I thought he was black - it is a soulful croon. The album has its moments, but the vibrato gets old after awhile and most of the cuts sound alike. Boy George sounds awful - a far, far shadow of his former self. He sounds like he fell out of bed after a binge of drugs and booze. This ""sensitive"" singer should have thanked Bryan Ferry in the credits b'cos that's who he's bloody ripping off."
2,Anthony and the Johnsons,"I guess what really kept me from ever truly enjoying this albums was the lead singer's positively bizarre voice. I really couldn't take the lyrics seriously either. Maybe it's one of those love it or hate it type of things, but in all honesty I couldn't move past the vocals or cheesy, bland lyrics."
1,What the ............??,"Last night, Anthony and the Johnsons were on the Letterman show, and he sang You Are My Sister. Anthony looks weird, his voice is, to say the best, unusual, but the song was unique and interesting. So today, I haul myself to MediaPlay, and buy the CD, slip it into the car's CD player, and my first reaction is ""What the ........ did I just waste $14 on??!!"" Given the other reviews, I am hoping with more plays, it will ""grow on me"", but I doubt it. I am not sure I can survive another listening. I gave it another listen (and another), and this is the worst CD I HAVE EVER bought. Think of a cartoon where two cats are fighting in an alley; the cats sound better."
1,Baaaaaa,"If you think you'd enjoy the sound of a voice reminiscient of a cross between a sheep and a deeper-voiced Cher, than this album is for you."
5,Heartbreaking and staggering,"this has to be one of the most beautiful and searing albums i've ever heard. I'm a fan of 'unusual' voices and artists, and Antony's vibratto, though yes a bit suspect at first, won me over within seconds. The vocal comparison to Nina Simone is fitting. Not very many artists get compared to one of the world's greats. The lyrics are dark yet inspiring at once, and you can feel the weight of Antony's words in his voice and delivery. Fantastic from start to finish, but be warned...this album is not for the faint of heart, or emotionally unstable. It may send you over the edge. It had me shedding tears within minutes. I Am a Bird Now is truly a stupendous work of resonating genius."
5,Anthony renews my faith in the human race...,"Just to listen to his voice and to hear his lyrics and melodies I want to meet him. Gentle kindness, the beauty is his art, the sadness and beauty of our existence comes through in his work! Anthony, email me for tea!"
1,Save your money,"After cruising many of the respected top of 2005 lists I came across this record and a few others of a similar style. My conclusion, this is by far one of the worst albums that I have ever heard, ever. I listened to all the tracks on this CD and thought it was some kind of cruel joke.What in the world are people thinking when they rank all of these weak, weak records as top picks? Antony and the Johnsons, Sufjan Stevens, Devendra Banhart? What is this stuff? Have people gone totally insane that they now think rehashed hippie folk sounds like the most awesomest thing in the world?Apparently all you need to win critical acclaim these days is play an acoustic guitar, sing in some weird falsetto, and whine about how horrible your existence is."
1,This guy won a Mercury?,"I literally spent half of the time it took listening to this album, working out whether or not it was a practical joke or not.After deeming my conundrum to the trash can, I listened a little longer.Still no luck.Although, it did give me flashbacks to the RSA where my Auntie Joan sang karaoke after smoking three packs and downing the biggest bottle of sherry they could give her.So, I think I'll take a simple approach to properly reviewing this album.This album - hurts, and not in a good way. Bad noise. BAD."
1,dire in the extreme,"I had always thought i had an understanding of a wide spectrum of music, but this left me totally bewildered, this has to be the worst collection of material i have ever had the misfortune to listen to,and those so called experts who awarded the mercury prize to this grossly undertalented individual should find a new career path. dire,dire,dire"
4,Moody and evocative,"Got a bit of Nina Simone going on here and if you are into Nina you're likely going to enjoy this. It's torch music that's a shade or three sadder.I bought this on hearing 'You are my sister' on Letterman. Loved that tune, but a whole album of basically the same thing may be a turn off for some folks - it can be a bit tedious.It's a love it or hate it sort of thing. Not for everyone, but that might be why it's so special."
4,"Moving voice of ""woman"" hits the soul","After having seen a beautiful appearance at the Jools Holland (BBC UK) show of this special artist, I became really curious to listen to his latest album, I Am a Bird Now. Most of the songs hit you right in the heart, the beautiful voice moves your senses and the easy sound of the piano makes it all very pleasant listening to. The only song I do not like is the song together with Lou Reed, because I personally think Antony's voice is not a rock voice."
5,"Amazing, breathtaking, emotional","I just got this last week after hearing a glowing review of it on National Public Radio, of all places. I was not disappointed. The music on the CD is amazing, breathtaking, and emotionally penetrating. I was drawn in and carried off by it. Sorry I never heard of Antony and the Johnsons before. Now, I'm buying their earlier work, too. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5,Seamus - Not a recording engineer or a producer,"I bought this album after seeing Antony at the Point Theatre in Dublin performing in ""Come so far for Beauty"", a Leonard Cohen tribute. Antony literally stunned the audience that night and outshone all the bigger stars. I'm not a ""Recording Engineer/Producer"" but I was a piano teacher a long time ago. I love this album, I love Antonys unconventional use of vibrato (natural not trained or whatever who cares) and his lyrics are a reflection of his own honest view of himself. I own 600-700 CD's (from Puccini to the Sex pistols) and I rank this in my top 30."
3,very unique,"i think the reason that most are giving this 1 star (which it certainly does NOT deserve) is b/c of the obvious GBLT references / support; open up the CD flap, listen to the lyrics of select songs, and its obvious; top it off with a very high pitched man's voice as the primary vocals and those he-men types will go running.shame they're so insecure. there's about 5 terrific songs on this record: ""i am a buoy"" is a terrific song, as is ""spiralling"" and ""my lady story"".granted, if you don't like the genre, you probably won't like it at all. but this album / artist is not as bad, or as terrific, as the reviews would lead you to belive. however, its unique format makes it worth checking out."
4,great golf,THIS IS WONDERFUL GOLF GAME. ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER PLAYED. IT IS NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS THE ARCADE VERSION BUT IT IS PREETY CLOSE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LIKES VIDEO GOLF
1,36 mafia ain't chit anymore,"man back in the 90's 36 was hardcore and never failed to delivered this group kept my faith up but ever since key members like boo, koopsta, and project pat lweft 36 kept going but then they won that freaking oscar and then crunchy left and 36 decided to go soft hanging around famous people and going white girl crazy on adventures in hollyhood then hate to say it 36 sucks now this cd is garbage man no limit, cash money, deathrow all fell off hard damn how 36 fell off please go back to worshipping satan or something do drugs, bring bacvk the homicidal raps about cutting nercks off."
2,Easily the worst Mafia record to date.,"This is but one person's opinion, so if your a fan you will have to listen for yourself. For those who just discovered them via their Mtv reality show, or their self hyping of the Oscar they won like three years ago, this is not the album to buy.By far the laziest delivery from the Mafia to date. From production to rhymes, it's horrible!"
1,rinky dink,This just in Three 6 Mafia just sighned to rinky dink records any true fans will know what i mean
2,WARNING: This is not the real Three 6 Mafia!,"Paul & Juice shouldn't have released ""Last 2 Walk"" as Three 6 Mafia, as the current lineup is basically ""Da Supa Producers"" or whatever silly nonsense they nicknamed themselves. This album is a slap in the face to all the fans (myself included) who have supported Triple Six since their Prophet days. Three 6 Mafia is Lord Infamous, Crunchy Black, Koopsta Knicca, and Gangsta Boo--not just Paul & J. The album itself is filled with one boring track after another, and it lacks any type of originality. The skits and Outro are no longer funny, as both of the two remaining members of Three 6 Mafia seem tired and bored. The lead singles ""I'd Rather"" and ""Lolli Lolli"" are nothing special, with the former being an inferior rehash of ""Slob On My Knob."" I thought Most Known Unknowns was whack, but this album is even worse than that. The 24 tracks don't feature even one memorable song. Last 2 Walk does however feature a whole lot of boringness."
2,Last 2 Conform,"I'm not really sure why this album was pushed back so far, I suspect these guys just tried a little too hard on the beats. They layered them well but didn't use tempo shifts nearly as effectively as previous albums. I wouldn't say that Three 6 has ""sold out"" but I could see how some say they've fallen off. This album was clearly not their best effort and sounds like it should've been released in 2005. Their recent success has caused them to lose focus from producing the transcendent southern grime that put Memphis on the map, and they have become another example in a sea of nameless radio mercenaries."
2,doo doo,"for production alone these guys got 2 stars...but thats it, as far as lyrical content and delivery and those awful hooks they get negative five from me....those beats though, they knocked hella hard. what a waste of beats, its kind of sad."
3,Wack,"I'll start off by saying I like almost all of Three 6, including Most Known Unknowns which I think was their best because they were able to take their signature style and bring it to the mainstream without compromising any of their originality. This CD on the other hand, looks like they tried way too hard to be mainstream and it turned out to be garbage. Lolli Lolli is the only song I can even listen to off this album, and even that one is pretty watered down.I know they still have it in them because What Chu Starin at and Project Pat's last album were dope. I hope they go back to that instead of making more of this garbage."
2,Not what I expected from the Mafia,Straight up GARBAGE! Maybe if they spent less time in Hollyhood and more time in the studio Last 2 Walk would have been ALOT better.
2,Not Your Normal Three 6 Mafia,"I've Been down with three 6 since the white tapes with the typed up letters, triple 6 at the time, but this cd, man i've been waiting on this for all this time and this is what I get, I'm disappointed in this cd becuz the beats, choruses, rap ain't right. What needs to happen is they need to get paul brother lord imfamous, boo, koopsta, crunchy don't really matter. Bottom line this shid ain't gone get it. Stop looking at that oscar and get to work. I miss the mytic styles they group brought and the mytic beats."
3,three 6 still rock!,This isnt their best album but they are still rocking! Any Three 6 fan would be excited to hear the latest work by this awesome duo now!
5,Suffering Can Lead to Greater Faith,"R.C. Sproul helps us understand suffering/death in the light of God's Word. When R.C. was a teenager and a non-believer, he had to care for his dying father. Years later, R.C. could say that his father showed him how to die with faith. There are other stories in the book to help us understand the impact of suffering on leading us to faith. Very important. None of us will escape suffering. Moreover, this little book is filled with scripture to build one's faith! The more we know our God, the more we can love Him and prepare to obey Him and to one day meet Him face-to-face."
5,An Excellent CD,This is one of the best albums that i've purchased. A Must Have for any country fan.
2,Shows promise,The title track and '26 cents' are catchy tunes. The songs that Amanda Wilkinson sings lead on are so much better than the others. She shows a lot of promise.
1,Pure TRASH!,"Amanda is sure no shania twain, instead of buying this cd buy something else you'll thank me for it."
2,Hmmm?,"Very contrived album. Not a lot of emotion or daring. I honestly think that Amanda shows a lot of promise and at her earliest opportunity, she will leave ""The Wilkinsons"" to pursue a solo career. If she does, she could be fairly successful. The other family members are only holding her back in my opinion."
1,WHAT KIND OF MUSIC IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?,"The Wilkinsons are ""NOTHING BUT TRASH""!!! What kind of album is this? Rock? R&B? SOUL? Well, it sure ain't country!!!!"
1,26 cents is about all this cds worth,"I thought is was kind of strange to see this recently released cd at a used cd store. I figured I'd give it a shot, what a mistake that was. 26 cents is the only good song on it, the rest is nothing but pure annoying garbage."
2,"Well documented, though not unbiased","Smith's book is well documented and well written. However, it falls down as it continually condemns Zionist and later Israeli actions with little mention of Arab activities. A major case in point is the frequent use of the term ""Palestinian rage"" in reaction to Israeli incursions in and occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Nothing is mentioned about any ""Israeli rage"" after such actions as the murder of the olympic athletes in Munich in 1972. Arab rage is apparently fomented every time Israel beats them in a war (perhaps they should stop trying to fight Israel?), but the result of an Israeli loss would be the total destruction of the nation (as well as a likely repeat holocaust for the jews there). Smith does not acknowledge this state of affairs.Unfortunately, I have not found a truly balanced book on this subject. Always one side decrying the other. If you know of one, please post..."
2,Read with care and caution,"Like some other reviewers, I too bought this book for a college course and I too find it overly biased toward the Arab point of view. The author has the right to draw his own conclusions, but like any non-fiction book, readers must use their own judgement to evaluate those conclusions carefully. I don't know if there is an author without bias on this topic due to its sensitivity.It is also horribly dry in my opinion. I know it's supposed to be, but certain sections just drag on and on, it seems, uneccessarily.Read critically, not literally. If you have a choice (i.e. don't have to buy this particular book for a course or something) choose a more balanced author, if you can find one."
1,Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict,I bought this book with some other on the subject. I found it to be a total misrepresentation of facts. It is removed from being balanced and I found more then ones that it is not giving the right picture.It is what it says - A history. It gives the Arab propoganda a tool to use.As a reader you would be better informed with :1. From Time Immemorial / Joan Peters2. A complete Idiots guide to the Conflict on the Middle East/Mitchell Bard3. Myth&Fact/ Mitchell Bard4. Israel- The Historical Atlas.All this books I bought from Amazon with this one.As a reader I was more impresses with them and the information within them.
5,"Excellent, objective introductory text","Much ink and paper has been wasted on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict by propagandists claiming to be historians, so it is a rare pleasure to actually come across a solid, objective and even-handed introductory text such as this that anyone can use to gain an insight into the root causes of this conflict. Unlike the author of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Middle East Conflict"", the author of this book has no personal involvement with either side, and he does not try to spin-doctor, excuse or justify the atrocities committed by either said in this long historical conflict."
3,"More heat than light, but good source documents and footnoting.","This title is an informative and well-referenced history of the conflict in Palestine/Israel, and the author is to be commended for his excellent footnoting and inclusion of primary source documents. My only quibble is the tone with which he presents the conflict. While I share his political sympathies, I fear (as is seen in the lower star reviews of this book) that the language the author uses only leads some (Israeli sympathizers) to ignore the books factual claims and others (Palestinian sympathizers) to have an view of the other side as homogeneously malintentioned, which from my experience it certainly is not. Let us hope that that both sides can cease to think in groups so that a solution, one or two states, may be reached and allow all current occupants to have meaningful safe lives."
5,"Excellent, unbiased and well-documented overview","This book was on the syllabus of Professor Zachary Lockman's course on Israel and Palestine at Harvard, where I first learned of it. It is extremely well-documented, unbiased and comprehensive, and is also a very easy read. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is its documentation of early Zionists' use of terrorist tactics which Palestinians have more recently begun to use. Although some readers criticize the book as unbiased, it is difficult to make that claim since the book is meticulously documented and relies heavily on Israeli and historical documents and newspaper archives."
5,Beautiful and fascinating book about love tokens,"This is the perfect little book to get for valentines day. It is beautifully designed and illustrated and the topic is fascinating. You can tell that Roberta Etter really did her research for this book and many of the love tokens photographed in the book are from her own collection. Perfect to give to your sweetheart gentlemen for valentines day or to give you ideas on some love tokens you could give her, and ladies the same goes for you. You can make Valentines day special with the practice of exchanging tokens of love with eachother."
5,Cute and engaging toy,"This toy came with a lamaze clip, and not the clip on one shown on the image. However it slips easily around the baby car seat handle, or any handle or bar. My son especially loves the crinkly sound the wings of the yellow bee makes and loves to simply hold on to the toy."
2,Didn't do anything for me,"I bought this on recommendation from a friend. I didn't notice anything different while taking it, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,excelent music for the road,"Paul brown, George Duke and Gabriela Anders produced this CD. Rick Braun helps with a great touch. Very romantic tunes. You shoould buy it like I did."
5,Wonderful discovery!,"Gabriela Anders is not only a gifted singer, but also an extraordinary composer. The songs found in ""Wanting"" are original and well chosen, with the right mixture of feelings and rhythms. I strongly recommend this artist to everyone who loves music, and hope we can enjoy a second album soon."
5,The new jazz icon for the new millennium. Smooth!,Once I heard her voice I knew she would be the new SADE of the millennium. Simply fantastic!
4,"Smooth, Sultry, Warm; a star in the making","Blindly stumbling across this CD at a music store, I decided to give it a shot and ended up listening to six of the twelve tracks. Miss Anders' music effortlessly wraps around you. My reaction to hearing this young lady's CD was comparable to my reaction when I first heard young blues singer Susan Tedeschi back in 1995: This lady is on the way up. Don't miss this early-career work which, I hope, will be only the first of many in a very long lifetime."
4,A Sensational Debut !!!!!!,"I first heard the title song on a recent trip to my hometown of Chicago and was very impressed with the seductive quality of Ms.Anders voice. I heard Wanting again a couple of weeks ago & i decided immediately to purchase the CD. For the price this CD has to be considered a STEAL. All songs were acceptable,and the title song & the duet with Eric Benet was some of his best work. This CD also benefits from having George Duke & Paul Brown as producers.This is smooth jazz at it's mellow best, as well as a sensational debut. I plan to purchase Last Tango In Rio soon."
5,Superb,"I finally made it to reviewing this knock-out CD I've had for years now.Well, this wonderful pianist from Argentina who responds to the name: Gabriela Anders is a mature piano player and a very well-crafted singer with a beautiful and sultry vocal hue. And if that wasn't enough, she sings almost perfectly in English and Potuguese besides her native tongue Spanish.And into the CD, I'd like to express that my favorite cut is ""The Girl from Ipanema"", and it's soooo good that I consider it the best version (and I own several hundred versions of that gem from Antonio Carlos Jobim); but don't take my word for it; Check it out for yourself; Gabriela will enchant you."
3,Jazz standards revisited,Gabriela Anders offers a refreshing take on some favorite jazz standards. Quite an enjoyable CD to sit back and relax to.
5,"SMOOTH, ROMANTIC, RELAXING, EROTIC","Those are the words that come to mind when I listen to this gem of a CD. Perfect to just wind down, or for those romantic occasions with your special companion. I have as yet to find as relaxing and sensous jazz as that contained in this CD. If you truly enjoy listening to smooth jazz, you have to get this CD."
4,outstanding after work music,"I was first introduced and mesmerized with this wonderful artist on a day that I thought would continue to be disasterous. I turned on my local smooth jazz station WJCD 105.3. Low and behold they (radio station) sensed my mood and played her title cut ""Wanting"". I knew that this artist had the right stuff to transcend me into an after work relaxing mode/mood. This artist definitely knows her voice and knows how to manipulate the words and sounds to soothe the listener into a state of pure bliss. She read my mind when she recorded this CD. Kudos to Gabriela Anders."
5,Must-read for any baseball fan,I've been a Nationals fan since the team moved to Washington and followed them closely during the first season. This book gives an insightful perspective from someone who was close to the action and knew the entire cast of characters personally. There are lots of great stories and anecdotes throughout the book. It's a fun read!
5,Legendary Singers,"The discs partly satisfied my needs in my preparation to present my latest book entitled SHOWCASE OF OUR LEGENDARY SINGERS at a book signing event; partially, because some of the song selections could have been better by featuring the vocalists' ""signature"" songs. Nevertheless, the discs were well done and served my purpose.AUBREY J. SHER on purchasing the discs through Amazon"
2,Not much instruction.,"Larry Scholl is an experienced cartoonist. He did his best to teach three important, ""hidden"", cartoon drawing techniques which when used, will make your cartoon drawings more interesting and dynamic. However, I found the DVD to be short on instruction, and long in vintage cartoon movies. The toons selected were Felix The Cat:""Bold King Cole"", Popeye:""Greek Mirthology"", and Superman: ""The Mechanical Monsters"". I'd rather he used the classic cartoon movie time for more instruction. I was somewhat disapointed with the DVD, thus the two star review. There are better cartoon drawing DVDs out there, e.g. Bruce Blitz, Bob Ostrom, and Nils Osmar."
3,Some entertaining moments,"In general, it had too many details ,that had nothing to do with the story and it dragged sometimes.I agree about the beautiful prose,but I often wondered what point the author was trying to make.I found the ending to be a letdown."
2,Disappointed in Hula,"I bought this on the recommendation from a couple of writers. I read the editorial reviews before purchasing and decided to buy in it. I ended in being very disappointed. I didn't feel that the characters were well developed, nor was there much to ""hang onto."" My thought is that the book was heavy on ""hell,"" but light on ""transcendence."" My belief is for a work to succeed, it must have both. I was very happy to finish the novel, not because my experience was richer for having read it, but, because by page 20, I'd had enough darkness. Question is: where is the light?"
2,"Shea, Lisa","Well Even Though This Book Was Easy To Read And Hard To Let Go I Thought It Was Very Hard To Understand, It Was Very Fragmented And Needed More Clearifaction."
4,haunting,"I read Hula a few years ago and it has haunted me so much that every so often I have searched it out on my bookshelf and re-read it from beginning to end. It has a mesmerizing lyrical minimalism that yet packs emotional insight into the twilight limbo of puberty. Like a punch to the gut, you don't always see it coming. This is an amazing little novel."
3,great for the aspiring actor,"although not an actor's traditional monologue book, this little gem does give you nice, entertaining material to choose from. i'm not sure as to its literary merit, but the point is that they entertain the listener. i performed one of the pieces at a theatre conference and got a great reception. the key is that they're not expecting this. as i said before, i am not aware that this is on a lower eschelon of french writing--i simply thought it was blackly humorous. give it a try."
1,All Gall: Malicious Monologues & Ruthless Recitations,"I am an admirer of Mr.Shapiro's translations, both of his serious and of his witty works. Thus, it came as a great surprise to find this small volume of Gallic Garbage as selected and translated by my favorite interpreter. The review quoted on the back cover of the book told me:""this collection will provide classic French wit and wickedness"", so I could hardly wait to open it and read it. Alas, the selections must have been from the bottom of the barrel [garbage, that is]and those famous names, Apollinaire, Feydeau,Tristan Bernard and others could hardly write more witless pieces than these in the selection. French humor is not like this! I surely hope, that this is not the ""shape of things to come"" from such an excellent translator of Baudlaire, Verlain and the Fabolous French."
1,NOT SO WONDERFUL:(,"Reading the rave reviews on this little machine makes you want one now! So, I got me one at Gaiam at a great price.However I was very dissapointed with the performance of it.It comes with batteries included (2 AA), disc for on/off and volume, and a tiny toggle button. Its speaker is small.This little ""radio"" has 9 different music loops ranging from 5 to 40 seconds each, which are supposed to play randomly.The problem is you have a five second loop playing over and over and over... until you hit the toggle button. And for a unit made to create an ambiance of relaxation, that's a huge flaw. You cannot relax and enjoy if you have to think about going to ""change the channel"" continually, unless you want to hear the same five second sound 120 times in a ten minute period.If you are really interested in the machine, go to fm3 website and download the loops, listen and decide if you want to have one of those loops playing over and over. If you like what you hear, then it's good for you."
4,Need supplement,"In depth study of individual CQB skills. Good info and training on firearms, but not detailed enough on CQB movements and searching skills .Best to be read with another STTU books in hand."
1,a waist of money,this book is a waist of your money. there is little of use to be learned here. the book leaves the reader wondering how some one can fill so many pages and say so little
5,cqb,This book is excellent for beginners and has a lot of relevant information in it. I does not go in depth into different stacks and entries for different types of rooms.
3,Good all around phone,"This Vtech model is ergonomical to use. It has simple controls. The voice commands are helpful in programming its many features. Also the battery life of the unit is good, as is the recharging speed. The only problem I had was with the answering machine. When I listened to the outgoing message, its sounded a little garbled, but it was understandable."
2,it was good untill the stick intena broke,"ok i got this phone after i saw my brothers, i thought wow that phone is the coolest soo i got it for my birthday ,but the one i got had a stick for a intena, what happened was oveer time the intenna started to bend and on day simply snapped off!! no i have a phone with no intena and can now only go tto the other room. on monday i plann to buy the panasonic 2.4gig for my birthday hpefully this will be a sucses and the intenaa wont be a stick"
2,Lots of Features will not make it dependable!,"I purchased this model V tech VT-1970ci Cordless phone for my work desk a while back, and I was very disapointed by it. I bought it because of its wonderful feature set, which is vast, and makes it a very easy phone to use and operate.Here is the bad news though folks. This phone is just unreliable. Sometimes my calls will fade in and out, and it seems like there is a great distance between me and the person on the other line. If you do adjust the volume the voice just becomes fuzzy and gargled. I suggest you avoid this V Tech phone, spend about ... more and get a digital 900 Mghz phone from Sony. My Sony I have had at home for two years now has been nothing but fantastic."
3,Fourth time lucky,"I had to exchange this model four times (my ninth cordless this year) and settle for the newest flimsy antenna, but the unit I have now is great. The sound quality is the best, the spare battery is very, very convenient. Placing the base unit in as high a spot as you can and still use the answering machine improves sound quality. The headset capability was the biggest selling point. Now that I have one that works, my biggest gripe is that the Caller I.D. only dials seven digits while I live in a 10-digit city."
2,"good phone, but the signal does cut in and out","dont get me wrong, i like this phone a lot. has a nice look, lots of features, good range, and is sturdy. but, like a few other customer reviews, i have to agree that during your phone calls, the call will cut in and out. not too much, but the fact that it happens is quite annoying for the price youre paying. another complaint is that the answering machine is very garbled- not clear sounding at all. some messages i cannot understand the name, number or message."
2,Keypad is a problem,"My V-Tech phone has some good points: great range, excellent clarity, great call waiting (picks up every call quickly), convenient features. However, 3 months after purchase, certain buttons on the keypad would not work. It was hardly the same button twice, and the problem is intermittant, but annoying and inconvenient nonetheless. My friend also has the same phone -- her first, the same keypad problems. Her 2nd V-Tech's keypad was fine, but the call waiting would not register calls consistently. Despite the price and clarity, I would not purchase a V-Tech phone again."
2,"Good, but flawed","The handset is nice. It is easy to read and the buttons work fine. The sound is acceptable. The major flaw with the phone is that it tends to cut your caller in and out. Very disconcerting. Worse, the message we recorded for the answering machine does the same thing. If you don't mind intermittently missing part of the conversation, this is a good value."
4,The Imperial is Superial!,"The Flipmode Squad pull out a stunning debut record. Led by lyrically acclaimed Busta Rhymes the Flimode Squad show you that they are not to be messed with. Although Busta is not at his peak, others shine through like Lord Have Mercy, Spliff Star, and Rah Digga. This album is well balanced with songs like "" run for cover "" which come at ya, and songs like "" money talks "" that have a catchy melody to them. The best song on this album is probably "" cha cha cha "" which makes you wanna jump, but "" everybody on the line outside "" is solid as well. This is deffenitly a must buy rap album. With funky beats and Busta's Rhymes you can't go wrong with this one."
4,RHYMES GALORE,"Busta Rhymes, in my opinion, is the best rapper/performer ever. His rhymes galore blow away the competition. When Disaster Strikes is the coolest CD ever. I love every song on the CD. I know all the words to Put Your Hands, Dangerous, Rhymes Galore, So Hardcore, and Woo-Hah. The new Flipmode CD (The Imperial) was somewhat of a dissapointment because it wasn't just Busta. I like when Busta goes solo. Flipmode iz da squad (which is what my necklace that i made says), but Busta got madd rhymes. He can't be touched. He relies on his own philosophy which is ""There is no time to be takin' time for granted."" Words to live by. You can't beat the lyrical player pros! FLIPMODE IZ DA SQUAD!!!"
4,An Excellent Album,This Album is one of the best that Busta Buss Ever did. I bought it today and I listened to Cha Cha Cha like 90 times...Go pick it up or get it at Amazon...
1,No need for this one...,"The 2-disc set called ""The Best of Gil Scott-Heron Live"" contains the full length cuts that this one edits. It also includes the incredible 23 minute version of ""Angel Dust."" This disc is superfluous."
5,Love it!,"This product is great moisture for your hair. Both my husband and I use it and love it. It used to be available in the stores, but we can't seem to find it anymore. We've been using it for years. Good to see it available online!"
5,Best quick connects ever made!,"I have some of these that are over 20 years old and still work like new! Recently purchased a few more to replace ones that had gone missing, and quality is the same as it was when they were first made. It's a shame Nelson discontinued these in favor of the plastic models! Luckily they can still be found here on Amazon!"
5,The Best Quick Disconnect,Wonderful product; NOTE: The quick disconnect that are packaged with the hand held sprinkler nozzles are not the same size...the learning curve.
2,was new in box,"The toy was new in the box, but there was an opening made so you could try the toy in the front. The toy was dirty so I'm assuming whatever was on it got on it through that opening. It look very dated. And the picture on the front was coming off."
4,"Great promise, which isn't fulfilled","Stephen Herek wanted to create a romantic comedy with a twist - ask a serious question: what would you do if you knew you only had a week to live? Unfortunately, the answers the movie gives are so obvious and predictable the 'twist' actually hurts the movie.Angelina Jolie is great, and so is the supporting cast. Edward Burns does an OK job as the 'I don't like to shower' looking camera man Pete.The only special feature on this DVD is a director's comentary. Unfortunately, it was put in the 'Sound Options' menu, where it can be easily missed by peope."
1,"you would have to pay me to buy ""life or something like it""",this movie was horrible. the movie had a ridiculous plot and both edward burns and angelina jolie's characters were annoying. someone would have to pay me to buy this dvd.
1,"If Joilie is in it, then it is stupid....","This is another rupulisve movie. Everyone in this movie looks like they were ready to play in a porn flick, and it comes off as porn, even though they still keep their clothes on. Jolie shows of her looks, her lack of acting ability clearly evident, and shows that this is a stupid production."
4,Is this a drama or comedy?,"The trailer for ""Life..."" kinda got me puzzled. Angelina Jolie who is noooo Michelle Pfeiffer who did ""Up Close And Personal"" plays a Seattle News Reporter Personality is given disturbing news about what is going to happen to her in the future. Jolie takes a look at her and makes a few changes If it is going to happen...Hey! she'll do it with a BANG! The look and vibe of the movie looks appealing and despite its odd twist I will definitely check this one out."
3,Movie Review,"Refreshing and powerful film that reminds you of the importance of living each day like it's your last. Overall, good performances and great angles."
4,An OK Romantic Comedy Impacted By 9/11,"It's not Angelina's best work but the movie is watchable with all the supporting characters portrayed by Tony Shalhoub, Edward Burns, Stockard Channing and even President Charles Logan(aka Gregory Itzin).The reason this movie originally got negative ratings and poor box office was because it was filmed in the summer of 2001 and was probably seen as a movie with a ""September 10th"" attitude.After 9/11, the country was in a surly and cynical mood about anything that reminded people of superficiality that existed before the attacks. At that time the movie came out, people were more in a mood for ""killing all the bad guys"" and ""turning countries into glass parking lots"" than romantic comedy.This movie would have been a box office success if 9/11 hadn't happened but the late Osama Bin Laden had other plans and altered everyone's lives."
4,Angelina reinvents herself.,"Angelina has made a carreer out of playing physically tough women. In ""Life or something like it"", she plays an emotionally strong women. Angelina plays Lanie Kerrigan, a tv journalist who has a path set out for her life as well as her carreer. Then, a homeless man with E.S.P. tells her that she is going to die in a week and a half. Lanie must figure out what is important in life before it is too late. Is it her job, her boyfriend, or the simpler things in life, like the laughter of children and taking the day off to go to a baseball game. Whatever it is, will Lanie figure it out before its too late? Angelina gives a heart string pulling perofrmance in this romantic comedy co-starring Ed Burns as the camera man with an attitude, and Stockard Channing as a Barbara Wlaters-esque journalist that Lanie aspires to be.This is a wonderful movie. Go see it, but bring your tissue box."
4,Enjoy life while you can,"The plot of the movie was good. But it seemed to be lacking in something.Good actors,good plot but did need just a little more."
5,"Good at first, and it grows on you","The ""professional"" reviews of this CD I've read are just plain wrong. I don't care about Miss Lewis' credentials or lineage, I care about whether I enjoy a CD or not. I've gotten much more than my money's worth listening to these tunes, and I believe most people would. There are some songs you like immediately (January's Child), and some which get better as you listen to them (Loaded), but as you listen your enjoyment will evolve into an appreciation for this budding artist's writing and voice that transcends the poppy hooks and clean production values. I hope her next album is low budget and a bit harder edged, but I plan to buy it nonetheless."
3,Strong but not unique.,"Lewis' record ""Little Leviathan"" is a fair effort, but it seems a tad pedestrian considering some of the other singer/ songwriters out there. There is very little to recommend it over, say, the last Shawn Colvin record. (Coincidentally, Colvin compatriot John Leventhal produces ""Homesick"" on the disc). I don't understand the Alanis Morrisette comparisons. (Not being an admirer of Ms. Morisette in the least, I think it's an insult to Lewis' vision as an artist).Still ""Nowhere and Everywhere"" should have been a top ten single and ""Homesick"" has teeth enough to be convincing. The touching ""Poor Dead William"" and narrative ""Outside"" (is that in 6/8 time?-nice!) are standouts along with the two previously mentioned tracks.If Lewis steps out of the shadow of her influences and producers I could see her creating a serious album of beauty and depth. (I mean for this to be a three 1/2 stars record, but Amazon doesn't allow for finer distinctions than one star)."
4,Great Book - StoryLine a Little Rambling,"I love the story and the characters. They aren't pretty but they aren't that cruel either. Just sorta normal with a little good and bad in all of them. I do think, however, that I would have liked the reader's digest version of this book better."
2,Many corrections needed,"I would have rated this product higher if there weren't so many errors in it, particularly in the answer key. When the whole point of the workbook is to teach children how to do fraction problems correctly, to have so many errors is inexcusable. If I hadn't been going over the work with my daughter, she would have ended up learning wrong, or at least have been very confused."
1,No issue with seller. Just the content.,"Horrible writing. Many paragraphs require rereads just to get it. I don't know if it is the way the words are phrased or it's missing commas.If it hadn't been my course required read, I would have thrown it into the garbage bin the net day."
5,Excellent CD !!!!!!,This CD is a must have for anyone who is into breaks or electronica style music. Just another album of pure genious music creation. I love it !!!!
5,Wow the first...,Be prepared.The best thing I can recomend is to run down the street with your hair on fire.Okay so not really but this disk is kind of like that only with more dancing.Buy this now or forver have your soul cast into the depths of crappy music and mediocore times.Enjoy.
2,Bland beats,Slightly lamer than the older Icey stuff but it still sounds like him. It's not all bad but there is alot of room for improvement. Just callin 'em how i hear 'em!
3,Buy the 58531 kit instead,"The problem with this tool, is that it will only replace the smaller diameterSchrader valve cores, used on American vehicles, and half the vehicles out thereare not American.The 58531 kit goes for another $20.00 but will R&R; the larger JRA high flow Valves.I gave this tool three stars because unless you go to the Mastercool web site for usage specs,you don't know what it actually does."
5,Stompy Jones - Fantastic,"This is a great high energy swing CD. It has a good mix of fast and slow danceable (lindy-hop, blues) tracks. It's refreshing to see some excellent quality swing music that isn't in the Neo-Swing category. If only the Swing Session and Stompy Jones had more than 3 CD's. The recording quality is also very good."
5,all cat and art lovers must have this book!,"Andrey Edney has presented a beautiful selection of art related to cats, wild and domestic! buy it while it is still available!"
2,"Dragons, like pizza, are awesome. So even lame ones are a little cool.","These dragons look pretty cool (not as cool as one of McFarlanes STATUES, eh, but still...). They each come with 2 helmets. Each helmet activates one of the two LEDs hidden in it's chest so they light up with one of two colors depending on which helmet they use. The reason these dragons get only 2 stars is that they are not very poseable at all and I am all about poseability. The bottom jaws moves up and down a bit. The head pivots on one axis where it connects to the body. The hind legs have two axes of movement where they meet the body (like the shoulders of a 3.75"" G.I.Joe). The front legs are the same with an added one axis of movement reverse (bends forward) knee. The wings are on ball joints where they attach to the body, but the shape of the wings and the body prevent you from being able to move them much at all. The tail is completely static. For a construction kit toy, these things should have A LOT more joints."
5,Out of the Bag,"Everyone likes The Secret Cat! Who gets the cat? Starting with an excellent and telling cover, the story develops important themes. You may think you have guessed at the ending but then may be pleasantly surprised?"
4,Three excellent films,"... I agree that both CRUSH and CONFESSION are wonderful films. However, THE MOUNTAIN KING, ..., is their equal in every respect. It's the slyest, sexiest, most suggestive and sophisticated film in the collection. I enjoyed it, and related to it, thoroughly. This is not to detract from CRUSH or CONFESSION, each of which sparkle in their own ways. These three films together make BOYS TO MEN the strongest collection of gay shorts I've ever seen."
5,"""Crush"" makes this anthology worth a look","Although all of the short films included in this anthology have merit, Phillip Bartell's ""Crush"" stands out as a witty, charming coming of age film with enough laughs and insight for a film three times its length. Bartell's deft handling of young actors is reminiscent of early Truffaut, and he evokes both the insecurities and the joys of a first crush with style and humor. Maida Sussman's evocative cinematography sets just the right tone (at times there's a nice undercurrent of unease to the sunny comedy that gives it nuance and visual complexity), and the movie is touching without being overly sentimental and funny without being overly broad. Like Scorsese's ""Life Lessons"" or Godard's ""All the Boys Are Named Patrick,"" this is a short that's every bit as satisfying as a great feature."
4,3 good (out of 4),"The problem with this kind of collection is that very often they are not coherent and the quality of each part varies a lot.This time we get only 4 short films and 3 of them are good. These are: ""Crush"" (first and the best, telling a story about a young gay boy), ""The mountain king"" (the second one where the main character is a man in his 20's) and the last one ""Confession"" (a couple of elder gays).The third one is a real flop.So, in general we receive here 3 stories from different age groups (from boys to men). Every character deals with problems typical for his age, fortunately without unnecessary drama.A pleasently watchable set."
2,a dvd that's not really complete,i don't know what better way to say but i feel a bit disappointed when i know that this dvd doesn't come with any english subtitles (that i have a deaf friend who really wants to know what the story is about).....
1,Waist of Money,"This DVD was trash, there was nothing to follow in done of the stories. It looks as if they got someone off the street to put it together. I would never recommend this film to anyone."
1,Monumental Coins - great book,"This book is fascinating. To see the buildings commemmorated up to 2000 years ago, on the coinage of that time - great illustrations and marvellous historical background... a real eye opener. We think we are so clever now, but what they could build all those years ago is a real eye-opener.S. Steverding"
3,"Good features, unclear reception","It sets up easily and and has good features, but its handheld reception is fuzzy with static in the same places where my simpler, cheaper one-line cordless works fine."
4,Pretty Good but...,"This phone is pretty good for the price. It has 2 lines and the ability to do conference calls, it also has a speaker phone on the base unit. But there are a few minor problems that I've notice. The range is not that great just slightly better than my regular cordless, and the farther you get the more static you pick up. The second thing is the mic seems to be too soft to pick up voices. People I talk to have a hard time hearing me, which might be a problem. Other than that it's a great phone for the price."
4,Nice and Comfy,"I live in florida and it isnt that cold down here. but I have a good A/C. I don't like the thick comforters because they are too warm, but this is just right."
2,Nice blanket; intolerable odor,I washed and hung the blanket in the sun but this wouldn't erradicate the odor. I could smell the blanket from the hallway while passing the room where it lay on the bed. A robe which had been laid on the blanket absorbed the odor and had to be washed!It's a very nice blanket if you have no sense of smell. I returned the item
3,Quaint !,"Definitely quaint, and sexy, though abominably old-fashionned, in the laboriously goofy plot, and loose character interactions. But all right, it's the sixties, and it's Bardot! My god, she's got something, this Bardot, to lift this little nothing movie out of the nothingness where it actually belongs. Who can forgive director Vadim for giving such small and dead-end parts to actors like Jean Tissier and Claude brasseur, for instance? But sure, he had Bardot, and the Bamba scene as well as the nude scenes remain (cute) classics....The DVD is decent in its viewing and extra features, too...I got my money worth..."
3,The most satisfying Bardot available.,"(Though it's only a matter of time before CONTEMPT is issued.) I don't know why it's so hard to get a sex goddess into a great movie. Billy Wilder managed it with Marilyn. Poor Brigitte spent her early years on film saddled with empty froth and scripts aimed more at third-rate philosophy than genuine drama. If not great, at least there's nothing in the way here of getting the full measure of this charming actress. It's amazing how far a few seconds of nudity and a surpisingly joyfull riverdance through La Bamba goes to make the whole deal worthwhile."
2,Naf et drle...,"Film à voir pour les fans de la belle blonde pulpeuse. C'est rafrachissant et léger à souhait, mais quelque peu décevant pour le cinéphile exigeant. Bon cinéma quand mme! Les blondes n'y sont pas à l'honneur encore une fois."
1,What the heck,"I put this disk in my computer and it said the disk was blank, and the disk is covered in scratches. I also bought it new."
4,It's pretty good.,"i thought this game was good, but it was slower than the PS2 version unless u have like a mac G5."
2,Deja Vu,"The authors of this game must have watched Groundhog's Day with Bill Murray when they created this game. Unlike earlier SW FPS games where you can save your progress and pick up where you left off, this game kicks you back to square one every time you're zapped. Graphics are equally as cool as other SW games, but it is disappointing otherwise."
3,Didn't cover the cutout,This works well but doesn't cover the cut out when the face plate is removed.I had to leave the outlet face plate on so that there wasn't an ugly hole in the wall showing.I rated this 3 stars but I like it; don't love it.It works well and I haven't had any functional problems; just aesthetic concerns.
4,"Solid, durable","This Coleman multiple outlet adapter is solidly constructed and seems likely to be more enduring than I am ever going to need.What I like best about it is that it has a screw in the center to attach to the existing electrical outlet face plate. This keep the Coleman adapter from pulling away from the wall when I unplug a power cord.What I wish it had was a better design. This adapter is a surge protector as well as multiplug outlet. That is a plus and makes it almost ideal for recharging devices. It would be nice if Coleman made a multiplug outlet designed to better accommodate the many cell phone, computer, and related devices which have adapter plugs that take up two or three times the normal plug width. There are lots of such adapters out there, and I own two. But the one's I own and that I've seen online don't have the screw to hold it to the existing face electrical outlet face plate, and/or they aren't surge protectors."
5,Great Bike,"I was looking for an inexpensive mountain bike to ride. Bought this for $200 and it is beyond my expectations. There is very little assembly. I recommend taking it into a bike shop or sporting goods store to get it ""tune up"" before you take out riding."
3,Okay,"I ordered this book because it was used, but rated well. The book itself is fine, a little bit of underlining, no big deal. The book did take a little longer than I expected, but was not a problem because I did not need it by a certain date. My only real problem is that the book REEKS like cigarette smoke. As a non-smoker in a non-smoking household, I had to leave the book out in a separate room to 'air out'. I don't think this was the company's fault, I would definitley order from them again."
5,The Cover Tells It All,"Cats you say? Take a look at the cover. Take a good look. Nobody does it like THE NEW YORKER. 101 cartons and 65 years later, the cats still have the last laugh. High level stuff and highly recommended!"
3,Good black metal...but too short,"Infernal are a great black metal band.....but they need to release a full length cd. I like their first mini-cd and this one is very good too but I crave to hear more of them. I recommend fans of Dark Funeral, Setherial and Marduk give this a listen. There are 2 original songs plus covers of songs from Morbid Angel, Von and Bathory."
2,DVD Review,This DVD is okay with very little instructional value. The program is done in interview form with very little teaching. A bad DVD for someone who is trying to get into jazz-funk playing but probably resourceful for those familiar with the genre.
2,Bootleg not actual video!,"I don't fault DM for this underwhelming DVD. As other reviewers noted, the song live is interspersed with other live clips. I associate certain images (fish & shark IYR, falling water/raindrop WFTNTF, diner scene ING, etc) from the Exciter tour with specific songs, so I was shocked to see those images used throughout the bootleg ""Freelove"" live video. Even the current tour uses specific images from tour and videos for specific songs. It can't be possible that Anton would have agreed with that thoughtless ""artistic"" decision! While this DVD is relatively inexpensive, I'd rather not have this in my collection. I was also disturbed the bootleg contained a shot of ""fans"" SITTING DOWN. Disrepectful! The one worthwhile piece of content was the clip of Dave. It captures his comic side and wonderful laugh. My advice is to put the money towards the One Night in Paris Exciter tour DVD instead."
5,This is just a single.!,"I dont see why so many people complain. This DVD costs 9$. I bought this along with a book so the shipping was basicaly free. When I go out and buy a DM single at a store like HMV I pay MORE then 9$Here for 9 dollars you get a nice big package, a videos plus two audio tracks. I understand the complaints if this video was 15 or 20$ but its 9.99. Tell me where else you can get anything like this for 9 dollars.Its defenetly worth the price, and it looks damn good on my shelf with my other DM DVDs."
5,So you know:,"Sole, Alias, & Dj Mayonnaise proudly bring to you... So Called Artists. The former Live Poets full length release 'Paint By Number Songs' features twelve tracks of biting emo-rap, alt-rock production and crisp turntablist work. The overall feel is dark, brooding, and aggressive, as Anticon emcees Sole and Alias tackle subjects ranging from the depression caused by signing their music away, to the perils of war. This electronic drums are no where to be found as the production is handled by Alias and Dj Mayonnaise in their trademark goth-hop style. 'Paint By Number Songs' has an edge unlike any other Mush release, and is one of the rare hiphop full lengths where all tracks are of equal caliber."
5,Extemely different for its time era!!,Nobody was making music like this in 2000 Buy this album its well worth it!
2,"emotionally disturbing for anyone under the age of ""11'","being that I was 11/12 during this ""made for TV"" flick. A drama but not a mellowdrama about a dog in the MH. Kid's don't like being subjegated to emotional baggage drama and violence in an otherwise lighthearted endevor about a dog. Me and my brother thought it was like ""Benji"" or ""Lassie"" boy were we wrong. I am reveiwing this by memory only, haven't seeen this POC in 30 odd years. But i think kids shows were(in the Fn '70s) a way for 20 something boomers to ""work out' thier own issues. my childhood, the X.I let bigons be bigons here as this is bigon and archane I MO and no wonder they don't sell it anyomor."
4,Great book until you get to the end.,The book was wonderful and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't wait to find out what happened in the end and was very disappointed that it left me hanging. I just found out there is a sequel and I hope that the end to it is alot better and will answer all the unanswered questions I have. Other than the ending it is a fantastic read!
4,Spellbinding and a wonderful read.,"She captures your imagination, you fears, and your sexual desires in one mesmerizing read. I just finished the book and I cannot wait to be drawn into the pages of Lasher.I do feel that the young and those who do not have a good handle on language would be disappointed in this book, for lack of understanding. This book is not for the naive or the faint of heart.This is my first book by Anne Rice and it will most surely not be my last. I am hooked."
1,Can you say BORING?,"I read about half of this sleeper and finally gave up on it. It may have been a good book if she would have made it a short story. I'll never know. I got so ticked off reading about boring family history and never reached the end. My first and last book by Ann Rice. Now if you want to read a good long book try Stephen Kings' ""The Stand"" or Robert McGammon's ""Swan Song""."
1,Sluggish and boring,"My expectations were high after reading all the positive reviews for this book, but I was disappointed. This was my first novel by Anne Rice and after 150 pages, I had to give it up. It was uninteresting and monotonous. I might try the Vampire Chronicles and see if they are any better."
5,The best Anne Rice book to date,"This has to be the best Anne Rice book I have read so far. It's sexy, suspenseful, scary, exciting.....the plotline is great! Dont get intimidated by the vast amount of pages (over 1000!). Because every single one of them hooks you in. The sex scenes are erotic without being trashy (or too Harlenquin-esque). All in all, its a very, very, excellent read. I recommend it."
4,Not Yet finished but dedicated to completing,"Bravo.. to the Reviewer Richard. I could not have put it any better than that. I started this book in April of 2002... I started a evening class which took my attention away now 10/02. But, I have all intentions of returning to the library and borrowing it again shortly after the semester's end. I had to record the page number which was about 850+... It does drag for quite sometime but the incredible imagery details I felt like I was in the story witnessing each plot. It can be a little scary to the point goosebumps appear but.. worth itTo sum up, richard said this:-Great depth and beautiful imagery-Excellent character development-Story tends to drag, but is filled with twists-Requires patience and time to completeIT'S WORTH IT.. Late charges and all!"
4,almost perfect,"I really love this book. If the author had not made it a sequel, concealing the fact until the last few pages, it would have been perfect. If you like history, you will like this book as well as I do."
4,Long but fascinating.,"This book was very absorbing throughout, a little too graphicbut the story is great and the others in the series are justas good. Highly recommended!"
4,Good Start,Either parts of the story seem to drag on or the story gets to be so page turning that I become impatient to reach the end. She writes a chilling story and brings you into each character. I can't wait to continue on in the tales.
5,A Work of Art,In this novel Anne Rice cast a spell over the reader. I can't help falling into love and hate with the facenating charectors. Beauty and love mixed with witch craft and sprits and Anne Rice's fetish with family make a novel that I just couldn't put down.
4,Takes your imagination places you never thought it could go!,"I love the way Anne Rice thinks, she knows how to bring her characters alive and keep you wanting more. The entire book was written exceptionaly well although I was a bit disappointed at the end. I expected something totally different. After I read Laser, that disappointment faded away. She is an exceptional writer!"
5,The Absolute Best Novel I Have Ever Read,"This is a novel I have reread numerous times. It is a wonderful time spanning work of art. Even though it spans 4 centuries, Rice keeps the flow moving so evenly that you never seem to get lost. The characters are so well written that they seem to live on long after you have finished the book.This book is very long but the closer I came to the end the more I wanted the story to continue. Fortunately Rice has written several more Mayfair witches chronicles. Although none of the sequels had the intensity that The Witching Hour possesed, they are each well worth reading."
4,Witchy Woman,"This book was very good. I really liked the history of the Mayfair witches. I wouldn't give this book a full 10 since there was so much nudity, as well as the characters rarely talking, but a good read."
5,"Rich, Beautifully Written and Ambitious","Anne Rice's Mayfair Family Chronicles are thrilling, and The Witching Hour is an amazing book.....not always easy to get through, and some will become impatient with all of the family history, but without that history, much of the book would be far less effective. Anne Rice has a rare luxury, she has a strong fan base that is willing to buy and read a book entirely of background for another book. The Witching Hour is not that, but the History of the family is intensive. It is a thrilling, wonderful book, rich in detail, lyricisim, sensuality and character"
5,Anne Rice's attention to detail is enthralling,"After reading the VAMPIRE CHRONICLES, I was hoping that Ms. Rice would live up to her attention to detail and her characters would be just as real and captivating. I was NOT disappointed. Keep up the Good Work"
2,Rice badly in need of an editor!,"<I>The Witching Hour</I> could have been cut into a novel of 300 or so pages and suffered no ill effects. There are pages and pages of repetitive description and dialogue. The ending is pathetic. To her credit, the book does have some interesting portions, particularly the early part of the ""book-within-a-book"" history section. If you read <I>The Witching Hour</I>, be prepared to skim large sections of it. All in all, and ignoring the weak ending, it would have been quite a good book if cut to a third of it's current length."
2,A slow start and a dissapointing ending.,"This book would have been great if Anne Rice had cut out 500 pages from this 1,000 page book. She tells the reader the same information over and over again. The Vampire Chronicles were great and I was looking for the same kind of action and romance. What I got was a fictional book that read like non-fiction. If you like that sort of thing you will love this book. Just don't read it with the attitude: I'm just trying to get to the good stuff. It will never come."
5,"If you only read one book by Anne Rice, read this one","This is Anne Rice's most mesmerising book. I had read the Vampire Chronicles before this, and I do love them, especially the first 2. But I found the Witching Hour more irresistable. Though over a thousand pages, I finished it in a few days. Just couldn't put it down. If you want to be taken away to another world, read this. When I was in New Orleans, I could imagine that the Mayfairs live in that city.All of Anne Rice's characters here are utterly compelling, Michael Curry, Julien Mayfair, Lasher, ...etc and esp. Rowan Mayfair, my favourite Anne Rice character (sorry Lestat).Make sure you get Lasher and Taltos, because when you finish this book, you will want more."
1,Absolutely Predictable,"from the start to the finish, I read, earnestly hoping that the book wouldn't turn out the way it seemed destined to. I was disappointed by the bland turns of plot blatantly spelled out chapters before any real action happened. The only thing I was surprised about was Mrs. Rice's lack of integrity in dealing with the character of Rowan Mayfair. Throughout the book, she kept it alive in spite of the bland world she was moving through, then at the end, betrayed everything it seemed she was and had been fighting for. Perhaps I just didn't get it, but it seems the whole series could have ended at book one quite plausibly. Dragging through another novel, simply to see if Mrs. Rice had enough sense to allow Rowan the completion she should have had in book one, is too masochistic for my tastes, I don't care if I'm missing out, count me out."
4,Good Book,"This is a compelling history of the Mayfair Witch clan. It is an intriguing look at how the Mayfair's made their fortune, and where their powers originate.Having read a number of Mrs. Rice's other books, Taltos, The Vampire Chronicles, etc, I found this book to be far less materialistic than some of her other books. She spends less time dealing with the description of aesthetics than in any of the stories of Lestat.Overall I found this book to be very good and would recommend it!"
2,A disappointment,"I have read a number of Rice's other works...I admire her grand and effortless mastery of the English language and her ability to conceive twisting, intriguing plots involving unique characters from both the past and present. I like most of her other novels that I've read, and I wanted to like this book...but I couldn't. The Witching Hour is massive and bloated. Overly long, it became a genuine effort to finish. I nearly put it down permanently until I realized I could flip through about 10 consecutive pages each time I encountered an extended description of New Orleans and not miss anything of the plot. Only for those with a great deal of patience..."
1,"Read This, Real Review","This book was toooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooong, and it told you nothing, way toooooo much detail, and history, and not enough story, no real ending and all she did was set up for a sequel(which is already out). i could have wrote both books in about 500 pages and made it good."
1,Twisted sick minds!,"OMG! What kind of sick mind? Incest and inbreeding!If you like reading about fathers, daughters, and 10 fold inbreeding, this book is for you. I need to go bleach my eyes now"
2,Humm...,I'm not crazy about her writing style. With all of those flowery descriptions she seems to be trying to hard and I catch myself rolling my eyes.I was expecting so much more.I think Anne Rice is off my read list.
1,A SICK TALE OF GARBARGE,Ann Rice must have a very sick and evil mind and it is sad that somewhere her real self got lost along the way and she delved into this garbage that ooozed from the bowels of hell. I used this book as firewood...
1,700 pages too long,"This book actually has an ok story, but Rice gets way too caught up with descriptions of every minor event in it. The history of the family was written like a real history, which may sound interesting, but in reality is just plain annoying. After wading through 250 agonizingly slow pages I did something I've never done before; I skipped to the end. And I'm a person who has read Stephen King's longest books in one sitting. If you like Anne Rice dont read this, it'll just upset you."
3,LONGEST DAMN BOOK I EVER READ!,"The cover and the title of the book enticed me. The actual size of the book itself annoyed me. Don't get me wrong, I love to read and a ""big"" (actually, monsterous) book doesn't scare me away, but this book was too long! Since I am not a quitter, I was forced to see this book through to the end. Once I start a book I can't stop until it's finished. Unfortunately, (or fortunately, for those of you who enjoyed The Witching Hour), there are sequels to this thing. I won't be rushing out to pick them up any time soon. This was a disappointment that took way to long to be over"
4,Powerful and Exciting. One of the few good gothic novels.,"Though I am normally not interested in gothic novels, Anne Rice seems to change my tastes with each novel. She recovers well from the sparse, boring, and unmoving world of ""The Mummy"" with this feast for the senses. Like ""The Tale of the Body Thief"" and ""Cry to Heaven,"" this ranks as one of her best novels ever. Do not judge this book by its length. There is nothing boring here, whether it is the entire history of the Mayfair clan, or Rowan Mayfair's mortal struggle with the daemon Lasher, this novel maintains a fast pace and deep insight throughout. Definitely one of my favorite modern-day novels"
3,Typical Anne Rice Format,"For those of us that have read other Anne Rice novels, you will notice a pattern forming. Rice builds up her novels with huge piles of information, but then the ending always feels rushed, and underdeveloped. However, she is a master storyteller, and no matter how slowly this book reads, it is difficult to put down. Rice's talent for completely engrossing the reader is still evident. The Mayfair history is an engaging one, but those that have trouble handling constant incest should stay far from this book.Personally, I prefer the Vampire Chronicles over this new series. The characters are more engaging to the reader, and tend not to move so slowly. But if you love tales of lore and myth, The Witching Hour will be a good choice."
4,"Dark, Morbid... Rice","A long read, but worth it in the end, somewhere along the middle Rice over does the details and slows down the story's pace to a snail's crawl, but she picks the pace up after a bit and takes a hold of your will to sleep, it's really difficult to put down this book before reading it whole and even then the only real problem I see with ""The Witching Hour"" is that once you're trough with it you just crave for the next book of the series... remember the feeling? If you recall the ending on book two of Rice's Vampire Chronicles you'll sure know what I'm talking about."
4,"Flawed . . . Yet, I Couldn't Put It Down","I finally got around to reading this book that I've had on my shelf since it came out! It was absorbing and mesmerizing and quite a good read for a snowy weekend. But, I was disappointed by the ending and by the fact that many issues were simply . . . abandoned, I would say.Still, her prose is beautiful and makes you wish this book were absolutely perfect. Her many characters were well drawn and individual--suprising, given the number of female witches there are in this book. It seems a daunting task, but I think Ms. Rice caught every character's ""essence"" and made them stand out.Overall, a good read."
4,Amazing,This is an amazing epic tale. I adored the section on the Talamasca file. The only reason it didn't recieve five stars from me is because the ending was a little to sci-fi for me. Absolutly worth the time taken to read.
4,Do you believe in witches?,"I ran across this book while searching for a new author to read, as I waited for Stephen King to write a new one. I am so glad I gave it a chance. It turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read. And Anne Rice turned out to be my 2nd favorite author. I would have to agree that it was a little slow at the beginning, but very soon you are unable to set it down. It will have you believing in witches too! I encourage everyone to get a copy."
1,Why Bother?,"This book makes me question why I read books in the first place. Do I want to be bored as I read wordy descriptions of pointless characters, who's every life detail is laid before me - or do I read books to be lost in a good story, care about well-written characters, and flip page after page of fine prose?THIS BOOK OBVIOUSLY NEVER SAW AN EDITOR. And if it were 10 pages long, it still might be kind of boring.If you want cheap porn, excessive descriptions and a pile of pages to make you feel smart, take it out, by all means. If you want a good story, stick to Rice's vampire works, or just find a half-decent author elsewhere."
2,I hated it,"I'm sorry, but I hated it. After all the fascination of The Vampire Chronicles I found The Witching Hour to be a horrible disappointment. It's not that the book was wholly bad. The descriptions of New Orleans were darkly beautiful and fascinating. The descent into the Mayfair Witch family was chilling. The problem was the ending. At the end of the novel I could be no less than disgusted. I was left dissatisfied and quite frankly almost angry with the characters in the book. While the prose in the novel is as seductive as The Vampire Chronicles there is just something in Witching Hour that left this reader dissatisfied and slightly nauseated by the book. Then I made the mistake of thinking the book Lasher could make up for the horrible ending of Witching Hour -- it didn't. If anything, the sequel to Witching Hour made the characters even more unpalatable. For myself, Rice veered off course near the end of this novel and that mistake was enough to ruin an otherwise interesting book."
1,Pick a Plot,"I enjoyed the first hundred pages of the book. I especially enjoyed the character development. But then without warning the main character acts in a way that seems to contradict the developement of the first several hunderd pages. To make matters worse the book ends without explaining this enough. I never read the next book, if that was Anne Rice's intent to catch my interest she should have done it with less of a time investment. I have better things to read."
4,Like Harry Potter but for adults,"This book, and the others in the series are fabulous. With the exception of the 400 page history of the Mayfair family, which i personally found boring, the rest of this book is a spell-binding page turner that you can't resist. The protagonistis are so easy to like, the villains are so easy to hate. As this series progresses there is more and more detail which has revealed to me what an accomplished novelist Anne Rice is. Her historial scope of actions between generations (and between chapters) is masterful. if you like books about witches, ghosts, the supernatural and even a book that makes you think about life a little, this is for you. Try out the witching hour and if you like it, pick up Lasher, the second book. I dont think you'll be disappointed. Seriously, its like Harry Potter, but with adult prose and plenty of sex scenes!"
3,intriguing,i don't know why i liked this book but i did. the history of the mayfair withces was long and drawn out it turned out to be more interesting than the actual story. all the incest really turned me off until about halfway through you get used to it. but in the end it intrigued me to read the second in the trilogy. it's a good read. i'm just not sure why. intriguing i guess is the key word.
2,"Mediocre, little better than dirt","Hundreds of pages filled with dry prose makes this book no better than any of the timeless classics nobody wants to read. I picked this book up at the airport in August of 2002 and I still haven't finished reading it. I wish I could say Rice could have cut out a few hundred pages, but sadly, they are all necessary, as she has successfully created an over-elaborate mess of history that noone really cares about. If you like books that drag on and on, by all means, get this in both hardcover and paperback."
2,Serious call for editing,"I thought that the history of the family was interesting, but that it became too cumbersome to keep the story moving. There was far too much repition of information we the reader had already received. Rice tries to keep the reader interested with incest and detailed settings, but overall there just wasn't enough action to hold my own interest. If you are looking for a detailed biography of a family of witches, this book is for you."
4,a truly extravagant book!!,"being a witch myself, i found this book truly hipnotizing. though the she does not portray witches as they really are it is a good fantasy book. it has a exotic, sensual story. i did not find it to have much truth in it and it reminds me of a good faery tale."
2,A good way to kill time,"Anne rice tells a good story. It takes about 300+ pages of family history to get to it but once you get past the constant repeating of the families incentious familly tree it is basiclly a story of good and evil. You really become attach to the main characters, Rowan Mayfair and Michael Curry the ending is preety much a cliff hanger to get youto read the next book Lasher which is not recomened"
3,Fairly disappointing,"What amazes me is the number of thumbs-up this book has received. I purchased it while on my holiday in Italy, lured mostly by cleverly designed cover (paperback edition with a hole) and ""her sexiest??? work yet"" accolades. BTW who writes such stuff, anyhow? Well, rest assured -- there's definitely no sex here! Just a rather boring variety of accounts detailing author's peculiar taste for trans...(help me here, something human and something not human) incest. After watching ""The Interview"" it's kind of ""not unfamiliar"", if you know what I mean. And it definitely is not ""Foucault's Pendulum"" although you might wanna stay clear of the similar inevitable anti-climax once you decide to finish the damn thing (that's what you get when a book you're reading has references of the Templars). The ""good"" thing is the book is REALLY long."
5,Engrosing Read,"This is typical Rice storytelling. Her discriptions from the five senses make the settings in this story become real. Her charactors are well developed, and thier story is tantilizing. For readers of Anne's Vampire series this story is a must read, along with Lasher and Taltos, especialy if you are going to read her latest works Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle. All of wich are interconnected."
3,You Get what it Promises,"The very title of this book is The Witching Hour: The lives of the Mayfair wiches, and that is exactly what you get. If you are looking for something with a continuous, intriguing plot, this is not for you. This book reads like a documentary more than anything else. What starts out as a first person story quickly becomes a reading of long historical records of an incestuous, tragedy ridden family.This book is meant, in my opinion, to prepare us with details for the next two books in it's trilogy. We are introduced to the characters, but should no expect any kind of conclusion or closure here."
5,Must read,great book! great trilogy! this is my second time reading it and i will be reading again in the future.
5,Excellent book!,"This is one of the longest books I have ever read. It starts a little crazy, doing multiple stories at once of the different people involved, but when it finally comes together, it's impossible to put down."
4,A nice twist,"It took me a very long time to actually get through this novel. It is extremely long, in my opinion. But once I was able to stick with it and read past the first 100 pages or so, I was hooked. This book is intertwined with Ms Rice's Vampire Chronicles nicely. I just love Anne Rice's discriptive writing style and totally gobble them up."
5,Dark and beautiful,"I remember not getting 50 pages into this before I gave up the first time. The second time, a few years later, I was determined to finish it. I am so glad I did. It is a very heavy (not literally), dense, somewhat complicated mega novel. There are MANY characters to keep track of, but the way Anne writes about her characters and the history of the time period, it is just too perfect for words. This novel has it all; Its gothic, beautiful, witty, seductive and above all, highly entertaining. It still took me a little while to finish it, but I am glad I stuck with it. The payoff was worth it. I do plan to re-read this sometime in the near future.If you are an Anne Rice fan, please read this, you will not be dissapointed. I have read every single Anne Rice novel, and this is up there with some of the best written ones."
1,"Oh, for the love of <deleted>","Reading this book was an act of faith on my part. That faith was very poorly placed. First, you get maybe 300 pages of actual plot and current-day character development. Then (@!*%#), you are subjected to another 300+ pages of a historical narrative that *never seems to end.* When the story resumes, you are dragged along as characters act in a ""most unseemly"" way. Finally, the ending is the worst I have ever seen in a book this long. After having read (and suffered) so long, to make the ending essentially a ""stay-tuned-for-our-next-book"" finish is like pouring acid in the already festering reading wounds of those who somehow managed to make it that far to the end of the book. Ann Rice? Never again."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"I am a fan of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles. But I found this book to be incredibly long (I usually love long books), drawn out, boring, ect... I felt like I was reading a history book in school. It was hard to remember who was whose mom and dad. And what uncle slept with what neice or father with daughter. I found myself very tempted several times to just put it down. After about 500 pages it starts to get mildly interesting. But it still seemed like it went on forever. Even during the climax and at the very end I found myself skipping entire paragraphs at a time just to finish it.I DO NOT recommend anyone buy this book unless they are just really bored and have nothing else to read. Read her vampire chronicles instead, especially Memnoch the Devil and Queen of the Damned."
1,I'll never waste my time on an Anne Rice book again.,"Anne Rice manipulates her readers as much as Lasher manipulates the Mayfair witches. In a book of 600 pages, one would think she could have come to a proper ending, instead of a cliff-hanger (in order to sell the next book?) And maybe she would have, if she hadn't spent so much space in repetitious description of New Orleans, San Franciso and the family history of the Mayfair witches - descriptions that told us very little that was new and different than the previous iteration. But her worst sin was not being true to her characters. For 560 pages her main characters are depicted as brave, morally strong and intelligent to point of genius...then they roll over.... Much more satisfying, but requiring no sequels."
4,Deliciously frightening,"As someone who was less than impressed with the Vampire Chronicles, I picked up ""The Witching Hour"" with more than a little skepticism. I was immediately drawn into a world so frightening, so compelling, it made my skin crawl and kept me glued to the pages. This is one of the few books that I have ever read into the deep dark hours of the night. I was torn between the terror of reading on in the story, and the terror of not knowing what would happen next. It is definitely Anne Rice's best book. I gave it an 8 instead of a 10, however, because of a large section in the middle discussing Rowan's ancestry. Fairly long and tedious, and not entirely necessary. The mood was cast with Dierdre. Pieter's plight very nearly broke the spell."
3,THIS BOOK REQUIRES PATIENCE,(sigh) what can i say. this book was waaaaaaay to long. i can't say i finished. got to page 780 and pretty much quit. while the story line is fascinating Anne Rice over did the descriptions.in some parts she went on for 20-30 pages with nothing but descriptions. i read her vampire chronicles and they contained dialogue (lots) i love dialogue and expected this book to have it....but there was hardly any. it's the type of book that u read for an hour and then wonder what the heck u just read. if u can get into the story from the start u may finish it...but if u don't u r pretty much wasting your time. RECOMMENDED ONLY IF U HAVE PATIENCE.
3,"good, except for the end","I thought this book was very interesting and I read it in about a week. The reason that I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because the ending made me really mad. Now I have to read Lasher to find out what happened, and I don't really want to. If it has the same type of ending as The Witching Hour, I think I will burn these books at the stake. The Vampire Chronicles are much better."
5,The Very Best Anne Rice I have read.,"I loved this book from the very beginning. I could not put it down. Dare to open this book and be drawn into the Mayfair family.This is not only the best Anne Rice book I have ever read but also one of the the ""Best"" books I have ever read. I was truly sad when the book ended. I wanted more.At the time I bought this book I had never heard of Anne Rice. I was going on a family trip and wanted a book for the road. I read in the car, in the motel and every chance I could. ""Caution""... I do not recommend this book if you are planning to do anything other than read. If you are like me you will not be able to put it down. I would love to see a movie made of ""The Witching Hour"".... Five stars to Anne Rice for this amazing book."
5,reread,"Haven't read this in so many years its like a brand new story,reminded me of why Rice has sold so many books over the years. So glad she is back writing the kind of story that captivating from beginning to end."
5,fantastic book,One of her best books! I read this book 20 years ago and it is still one of my favorites.
2,zzzzzzz.........,"I have read other Anne Rice books and knew to expect some ""slow"" sections in this book. Unfortunately, the gripping, suspenseful and exciting moments in this book were buried between so much sedative Mayfair history that I feel like the first person who's read an entire book in their sleep. I could have skipped entire chapters of this book and would not have missed anything vital to the story. Some parts of the story were very captivating, but were few and far between. Recommended for insomniacs!"
1,WHAT A CHORE!!!,"Dry,boring, and long-winded describe this horrible book. Maybe if I actually made it to the end I would have realized the point of the story, but I could only suffer through half of it. I quit during the reading of the ""book within a book"" in the middle of this sleep inducing creation. Absolutely painful."
2,Last Anne Rice book I ever read,"Sometimes the values your parents instill in you backfire. Like always seeing a task through to the end. I wish I had given up on this book after the first hundred pages. The story could be told in approximately that many if Ms. Rice could have eliminated half of the lurid sex scenes and the self-indulgent, tiresome descriptions of her home."
5,the witching hour,"This book arrived in 5 days.It arrived in excellent condition with no signs of wear.It is a good book to read,one of Anne Rice's best"
4,Book was excellent but way too long,The story is very interesting because it is partly fiction but goes through numerous parts of history describing a family's life story. Anne Rice is very thorough in her descriptions without overbearing the reader with useless details.That being said the only flaw with this is book is the length which prevented me from giving it 5 stars because I found myself losing interest on two occasions.
3,Not for everyone !,"Overall I have to admit that I was greatly dissapointed by this Novel. While not a bad read, it's not exactly my cup of tea either.Anne Rice's decription of her characters and her vivid details, as always, are as descriptive as ever. Probably even more so in this 1000+ page epic. Which IMO is not always a good thing. The story is broken up into past, present, and hints of the future. But not exactly in that order.The entire middle of the story is the almost exclusively devoted to the HISTORY of the witches. Which could have been givin' a book of it's own.After about 500 pages I just couldn't get into it anymore. I no longer cared, but somehow I still managed to finish the story. And was treated to a mediocre yet unexpected ending.If you have read other works by Anne Rice and enjoyed those, then give this book a try. Otherwise stay away."
1,Meaningless fluff at its finest,"This was my second try at reading a book by Anne Rice (the first being ""An interview with a vampire""). I'm sure there was a plot buried somewhere in her meaningless fluff and run on sentences, but I couldn't find it. I read about 100 pages and decided I should stop wasting my time and do something worthwhile. Good luck if you decide to try and read this book."
1,Yawn...,"She could have cut the volume in half and still said everything she wanted to, which was apparently very little. After being enthralled with the Vampires, ""Witching"" was a bitter disappointment. I've read Fluid Mechanics textbooks that were more interesting."
3,Too much description it just didnt keep my interest,"I have enjoyed other anne rice novels but i could through about half of this one and just couldnt go on any longer. I was younger when my mother read this book, she said it was great but that i had to wait until i was a bit older to read it. The story was too hard to keep track of. I was highly disappointed."
1,overindulgent mishmash,I feel compeled to say that this book is truly awful in every sense of the word
3,"Question, questions...","The plot line of this book is something of a mystery for more than half, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I found the plot itself to be intriguing and that is the only reason I have decided to finish it. My complaints are mostly from Rice's wishful thinking. Most importantly being the incestuous Mayfair family. Rice described one incident of incest after another (and not that quasi-incestuous counsin stuff. Real father to daughter and brother to sister stuff), and yet almost every one of them is described as devistatingly beautiful. that would be one hell of a miracle of genetics."
1,"Excellent, until the end...","This book was written wonderfully, full of detail and charactor development, until the end where I was totally disheartened, with the feeling of this being it? For me, the reader, to have become so familiar with the charactors, including Rowan, Michael and Aaron, and then the ending left me w/nothing. Again, the book was one that I could not put down throughout the entire reading (even with the slow-reading chronicles), but the ending was just so quick and incomplete. I've began reading Lasher, and hope that this will tie up the many loose ends and questions that I have. I rate this book with a '1' because although well written 'til the end, I fear that I invested much time in 1038 pages only to be letdown with an incomplete end."
1,The withching hour is right.,"If you like witchcraft, this is the book for you. It isn't 'magical"" it's just...witchy. I actually gave this away as fast as I could."
5,My favorite book,"If you love a good, long read, with a lot of history, romance, and a touch of fantasy, this book is for you. I read it as a young woman many years ago, and recently re-read. Would not recommend this book for anyone younger than college-aged, and while it is not erotica, it is very erotic (and descriptive) in some places. Anne Rice's best work, in my humble opinion. I do not really care for her vampire tales or erotica...."
3,Too wordy,"The story line was good, but it was too wordy, tended to lose my attention. I think the same story could be told with a little less fluff."
2,Are you kidding me?,"The book is well written except that certain parts go on and on with superflous detail. But the climax is so ridiculous, I stopped reading to say ""Are you kidding me?!"" What a disappointment after wadding through all the history and detail, I felt cheated out of a couple days of reading."
3,good.....but kind of dissipointing in the end,"This was excellent.....until the incest. I understand it was part of the storyline, but did she have to have such vivid depictions of it...geez. She is a great writer and kept me reading till the end. I really wanted to know what Lasher was all about. Worth reading the beginning and the middle. The origins of the Mayfair witches and Lasher are very interesting. Disappointed in the end though. Rowan and Michael are ridiculous. There was a lot of cheeeeezzz."
3,a decent read,"This particular book took a little of my ""slogging"" to get through it. When I sat down to read I would be interested for some period of time and then had to put it down and rad something else. All told, is was a good read but it took some effort on my part to get through it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,The Witching Hour,I received my book very quickly and in the condition specified. I would gladly order from this seller again and would recommend them to others.
1,The Witching Hour,"I'd be the first to say Anne Rice is capable of interesting, creative work, but this one I wish I'd left on the shelf. Among the turn-offs, frequent regression into an earlier prose style... ...Art, truly. It's no shame, her starting out as a romance novelist, but by 1990 she really was well beyond this sort of silliness. You'll also be treated to page upon tedious page of somniferous family history, most of it inconsequential. This is an unimaginative 500 pager distended to an almost unendurable 1000. The topper is a clumsy, dissatisfying non-ending calculated to sell the next book. My advice, give this one a pass."
2,Too much like a history book,"I am a big fantasy lover, so I thought I'd give this book a try. The story seemed promising and started off as a great book. But then it went downhill. It felt like I was back in history class. I know some stories need some back ground, but come on. Way too wordy, I just could not finish it. I've been told that Anne Rice is an aquired taste, and I guess I just don't have that kind of taste. Nice plot line but just couldn't finish it."
2,Good Frisbee,"This was one of those books I absolutely had to throw across the room when I came to the end. It's incredibly, unnecessarily long to begin with, taking forever to get started, but once it does, I admit, it has lots of interesting places. (The reason I gave it two stars instead of one). However, after spending a VAST amount of time reading it, IT DOESN'T END. There is no resolution to the story w/o reading her next book. That made me so angry that despite the fact that I read all of Anne Rice's vampire chronicles up to Armand, I refused to read the next novel. Not only did I refuse to read the next novel, but after some thought, I refused to read ANY of her next novels. Waste your time if you like, but I like stories that end."
5,Favorite Book of All Times,This is my favorite book. A must read. And then go onto the Vampire series. I love Anne Rice.
4,truly bewitching,"beautifully written, anne makes you feel like your there. buy the set you won't regret it. i had the set in paperback but bought a hardcover set too, it's that good."
2,this is too long!,"It would be ok if something new and interesting happened frequently, but I only got halfway into the book before i stopped, because I was sick of reading all those files on the Mayfair Witches! I wanted to know what was happening THEN. I didn't care what happened a long time ago. It would have been more interesting if everything was a mystery instead of a sequence of events, because then it wasn't so surprising since the family had a long history of ""accidents""."
5,Completely engrossing,All of the witches are so fascinating. Getting to know about the history/spirits and events that shaped the lives of everyone in this family was amazing. I loved the amount of detail in her stories and this is one of my Anne Rice favorites.
1,It just keeps dragging on!!!,"I can't believe all the great reviews on this book! That is the main reason I bought the book! The story just drags on and on!! The same old information is repeated and repeated. With all the incest and other gross things happening in the story it makes me thing that the author is a little strange and I don't mean it in a good way. I don't know if I will finish the story because I see very little of any kind of witch craft stuff at all. And I've really grown to hate the characters, and to be honest with you, don't care what happens to them!!. It has taken me 6 weeks to get through 3/4 of the book because I literally have to talk myself into reading a little more hoping something will finally happen it this long, long, boring story. Wish me luck! If I get to the end and by some miracle actually start liking this book, I'll leave another review, but right now I don't want anyone else to waste their money. Believe me, she is no Steven King like one reviewer wrote!!!!"
5,FANTASTIC A MUST READ!!!,I just finished it and jumped on the net to find the name of the next book!!!!! It's a series HELLO!?? Great book!!! Exactly what I expected. Definitely lives up to her reputation.
4,"Good book, one warning for the kindle edition",I enjoyed the book and found the writing to be engrossing.... that is until words beginning with TH were appearing with an M instead. THE became ME. THERE became MERE. ETC. I eventually got past it because it became so frequent but it pulled me from the story nearly every time it happened. I give it four stars but honestly would have to give the Kindle translators work a two.
1,Misleading Name - This ain't micro usb form factor,buyer beware...the title of this product is really misleading. I bought it in a hurry from my tablet and didn't notice that micro connector is the name of the company. The adapter IS NOT micro usb form factor. Really stupid of me and of the mfg not to be more clear in their name and description
5,Ernie Haase & Signature Sound,"This is a fantastic gospel group and the DVD is two hours of sheer pleasure.I had seen this group on the Gaither Homecoming series, and just had to have the DVD. It is worth every penny and more.Guaranteed, you won't fall asleep during this show."
5,great group,"I love Ernie and the boys. Their music is wonderful. They are so full of energy and personality. This kept my family and me laughing and singing along. It also went GOLD recently. Congratulations, Signature Sound!! Thanks for lots of good family fun."
2,I planned to like it,"This probably isn't a fair review since i didn't finish the book. It just didn't resonate with me. I found the main characters a bit silly and light weight, the dialogue stilted, and the premise too far fetched even for fiction. Sorry, since I really wanted to like it."
2,Not to my taste,"I usually love historical romances but this one is not going to make my list of good books. This book moves slowly and is filled with slang that makes the dialogue very difficult to understand. I like sharp, witty repartee rather than long, involved passages that just drag on and on.If you understand the slang and don't mind dialogue that just drags out seemingly forever, then you may enjoy this book.I prefer a book that moves and this one, for lack of a better term, languishes."
4,Audio review of Friday's Child,"This audio version is very competently narrated by Eve Matheson. I especially like her male voices for Sherry and his various male friends and cousin. I did not like the voice for Hero because it came off whiny and simpering. This story is well written and has some humorous parts. I admire the way Georgette Heyer wrote compelling romances without all the physical love scenes. Great story, but there are a lot of characters and sometimes it was hard to remember who was who."
2,Audio Recording review,"I loved this BOOK and would give it 5 stars.The audio book, though, is very disappointing. The reader uses voices for the characters that are silly. The voice she uses for Hero Wantage, the woman protagonist, is high and squeaky, and the voice she uses for the male protagonist, Lord Sherringham, is loud and affected. Also, the narration bits are rather low volume, where the conversational bits are very loud. It's hard to get the volume set right to get both parts without getting a headache.Too bad the Audio Edition is so poor, since it's a wonderful book."
3,Not my favorite Heyer,"I am sorry to say that I was a little disappointed with this one. The first 2/3 of the novel was entertaining, but the last third was drawn out and rather boring. I would recommend ""The Reluctant Widow"" or ""Cotillion"" if you are a fan of Heyer or this type of writing."
2,Can't Understand the Praise,"I can't understand why so many people love this book. While I like Georgette Heyer, this book was too long, contrived, and boring. The hero both hits and slaps his wife, which is disgusting, and the heroine is not just inexperienced, she's willfully stupid. I found myself skimming the last third of this book, because it was so boring and plodding. I will definitely not be keeping it."
3,If you like these period pieces,"I found the speech interesting, some phrases I found hard to believe, but a prolific writer, I am sure she researched."
4,Good but not Great,I really wanted this book to be in my Top 3 since it seems to be a favorite among many Heyer fans but sometimes I was just annoyed with Sherry. I didn't like to find him so aggressive with Hero.That said the cast is hilarious and entertaining. I found myself laughing at the things Sherry's friends said and did. I am eager to read more of her books.
5,Amazing stuff (Edit: 4 stars),"If you're in the market for some nice short post rock/electronic pop music, this is a great EP to get. The best song is easily 'Glisten', which kinda floats by, and every second of it is like being injected with the best ethereal bliss. The end of 'Off White Room' has a cover of 'Computer Love' by Kraftwerk, which is cool.The only problems with this EP are that 'Project Loop', although a good song, gets easily repetitive because it's basically the same 5 second loop (as the name implies) througout the song; the other problem is that 18 minutes of outdoor noises on the last track is a bit much. Overall, a great EP to satisfy your needs for relaxing post rock."
5,Must have for Celtic Rock fans,A significant collection of works from a Celtic Rock genre leader. Spans the years from early in the genre to the bands peak.
4,A Great Resource for those Interested in NGOs,"If you are interested in NGO-Government partnerships and the history/dynamics there of, BUY THIS BOOK. This is a subject that is not extensively written on and Ian Smillie hits the nail on the head with this compilation.It is important to note, however, that this text does NOT deal with NGOs in the Global South."
2,Failed experiment,"This book had its moments, but they were few and far between. The writing was poor and the characters were not sympathetic. No romance at all, it was like a visit to a doctor with bad bedside manners. If you are looking for a good book by this author, try Constantino's Pregnant Bride or the Brabanti Baby..."
4,An explosive passion!,"Dr. Grant Madison's return might be causing a stir amongst the single women of Springdale, but he's back for one reason only - to rebuild his parriage.When he and Olivia first got married, they had one thing in common - the naive belief that blazing passion was all they needed. A series of hard lessons later, both are wiser, but apart. Now Grant has another proposal: to put passion on the back burner until they've established a foundation of friendship and trust on which to try again.A simple, sensible experiment - that's if they can resist each other long enough."
1,Disappointment,I was side struck. I thought the Beatles was singing and was highly disappointed when I listened to it. The advertisement fooled me. Don't buy if you want to listen to the Beatles.
1,The Greatest Hits of the Beatles Classical Style,"This CD is a con job. Amazon advertised this as a Beatles product, but when you listen to it you find out that as close as you get to the Beatles is the title-it's all instrumentals.I think Amazon should make this clear to the public in it's advertisement. I think from now on I'll do my music buying from half.com."
1,"A book ruined by silly names: General Jinnah, Orissa, Gamelan the Wizard","This book has a ""general Jinnah"" and a wizard called ""Gamelan"" in a town called ""Orissa"", so if you know anything at all about the world, you will probably not be able to appreaciate it or even get through it.It's like reading about ""President George Bush"" and the wizard ""Trumpet"" battling it out in the town of ""Scotland"". It reads like a bad joke. Regardless of what happens on the page, it's impossible to take it seriously with all these silly names drawn from real life. I suspect the book is better than these three names - in fact it pretty much has to be - so it's too bad that no editor stepped in to fix this MAJOR FLAW; sadly, I couldn't keep reading it."
5,Great Book for Fans of High Fantasy,Length:: 3:59 MinsA video review of a really enjoyable fantasy adventure.
3,A romping adventure tale.,"This is one of those average fantasy books that one picks up to get away from the heavy prose, thick character development, and ongoing sagas of authors such as Martin, Goodkind, and Jordan. It's a pretty straightforward story with light character development. The world is vividly imaginative and interesting. This will never be on a MUST READ list, but it's an enjoyable read."
1,Wrong size sent,"Although not Amazon's fault, the costume delivered was not the correct size. The package indicated that it was what I ordered, but once removed, it was a size smaller. The packaging said it was a child's small, but the costume tag said toddler. It was absolutely too small for my child and needs to be returned. I had to order and pay for another one because of this."
4,Works very well,"The product worked very well right from the start. It was easy to connect and use. But make sure you get the male and female set. I actually ended up buying a couple more. It works well with fixtures that are bent or straight as opposed to FAIP PowerWasher Universal Pressure Washer Brass Garden Hose Quick-Connect Kit. However, the Power Washer Quick-connect will prevent water from flowing until you connect male piece. That is a great feature but again it does not work well with all curved or bent fixtures."
4,Very suspenseful and well acted.,"James Earl Jones starts things off as a truly loathesome person. But the surprise comes with Don Murray, Mr. Nice Guy himself. Wait till you see what HE does! This movie is well worth watching. And you may never look at a cello the same way again."
1,"please read Jung first....ok, Don and Mario?","well..attacking Jung seems to be money rewarding, but what about reading and understanding him first? Don and Mario ( could it be the Mario Bros?) just seems to have skipped through, so why bother reading this book at all. As for the reviews they are simply apalling, one calling him Yung, the other Jong. Whats wrong with Don and Mario would be the big question. First: learn to write . Second: Learn to research Third: oh..well..leave it at that.."
1,the icecream has melted,"since my original review has been removed after being posted for a few days, I return to the same arguments, but in a more cavalier manner, hoping it will not now be considered offensive anymore.I was stunned that most reviews here were in the three-four lines spectrum, and altough praising Don and Mario, revealed little or any personal commentary on Jungs work, which indicated an audience that dislikes Jung even without having readanything by him. I insinuated that it did no bode well neither for the author nor for his audience, which could then be construed to be badly positioned on the highbrow-lowbrow spectrum. Sorry, but there is no nicer way to put it."
2,Author missed the point,"McGowan misses the point of Jung's work. Too bad, as he's a rather entertaining author and might otherwise have added something of value to the literature on Jung's life and outlook. Ah, well, Jung's writing is not for everyone. Those looking for simple answers would do best to look for someone other than Jung to read. McGowan's book has little value for the serious inquirer. The pertinent question is this: ""What is wrong with McGowan?"""
4,Just try to put it down!,"McGowan's work is deeper that to be expected from this author. Thinking I was going to be venturing into a sea of psycho-babble and double-talk, I actually found this critique of Jung (or ""Yung"" as his close friends referred to him after those late nights at the bar) to be well thought out and fair. And as a previous commentator insightfully noted, McGowan's sense of humour takes this form of writing to a new and loftier level. My only criticism is that the author failed to write a sequel to answer many of the questions he raised. Cheers to McGowan and jeers to those who stand in the way of the freedom to say whatcha please!"
5,Absolute essential for the well-rounded music collection,"This is a GREAT album. I was first introduced to the Gurus while studying in Australia, and I have been a fan since. In some ways they are like Bare Naked Ladies in terms of having a sense of humour in their music. They also make me think of Sister Hazel in terms of high energy. They are a bit of rock, a bit of alternative, and always a ton of fun. The lead singer has a great, funky, '80's almost alternative sounding voice. Songs like ""What's my Scene?"" make you want to drive real fast, or do a bit of a dance, ""Thousand Miles Away"" is a definite blaster, and on and on. These guys put on such a good show as well. At least listen to a sample!!"
3,Sony ...Soso!,"I bought the STRDE825 Sony receiver in 2000 and still haven't figured out all of the unecessarily complicated scenarios! The unit sounds OK but lacks bass punch. If you like your music in flat response, this unit will suffice. Even with full bass and treble attenuation, EQ and bass boost, it still sound flat. The remote is even more of an operational headache than the receiver. When you press certain features, the remote and receiver exchange data and you may wind up with a deleted feature. The myriad of sound fields are useless to the average listener and could be replaced by simple treb, mid, and bass controls."
5,Rings very true,"Unfortunately, I knew exactly who Dr.Weitzman was describing when she described the 'upscale' couple hiding a terrible secret.This book is important to women who have escaped from an abusive relationship or are considering an escape. From practical advice to checklists of traits of an abusive man (denial in these situations is very, very strong - seeing the evidence before your eyes brings you closer to the truth), to the case histories, the book brings home the reality of an abusive relationship.I want to make a copy of the 'traits of an abuser' and pass it out to my sisters, my cousins, my friends - and pray none of them recognize their mate."
5,nice,a bit pricey but works great. Comes with a funnel to avoid spills. Nice large container provided with it and easy install
5,Works great & looks great! And yes it does work with granite!,"Just got this soap dispenser at the same time I upgraded my countertops to granite. I was a little worried about it since one reviewer said it does not work with granite countertops, but it works just great so I have no idea what they were talking about! My faucet is a Kohler and I considered a Kohler soap dispenser but after reading reviews it sounded like this one would work better and actually I think the style looks better with my faucet than the Kohler model too. I had also checked out the more generic versions at Home Depot. Sure this one was more money but I think it's still a very fair price and with the added bonus of being able to read the reviews to hear how well it works, you just can't go wrong buying this soap dispenser!"
4,Nicely made and handy,"Very useful and convenient item. I got it on a whim because I had an extra sink hole to fill, but it's been useful as heck and does not feel likely to break down soon. It even economizes on detergent by dispensing saner amounts than I usually squeeze by accident from a regular bottle. This small attached bottle holds enough for a surprisingly long time.It's an expensive way to plug an unused sink hole, but I am glad I did it ."
2,Do not buy if you have 3cm or thicker countertops,"The threaded neck of this dispenser is not long enough to accomodate 3cm countertops, taking into account the thickness of the top of your cabinets too. Other brands have longer necks."
3,"One works well, the other not so much","We bought two of these dispensers last year: one for dish detergent, the other for hand soap (on the same sink). The one for dish detergent works very well. I'm able to gently squeeze out as much or as little soap as I want. The one holding hand soap, however, is rather troublesome. Generally, we have to give it a real forceful push to get anything out, but this makes it SPLAT out a huge dollop of soap, and often it sends the soap spraying around the sink, up my wrist, etc. It also makes a sick scraping noise. All of this tells me that we got one dispenser that works properly, and one lemon. This is a simple design, and I'm puzzled that there could be such a disparity between the two. So: 5 stars for one of them, one star for the other. Three stars on average."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"Replaced a leaky Kitchen faucet but it left an opening, could of put a cap on it, but this is a great way to cover the hole and get the soap bottle off the top of the sink. I LOVE IT! Easy to fill, and use."
1,Waste of Money,"After the easy installation the bottle lasted only one month before it broke and leaked all of the soap under the sink. The bottle is in a very protected area which negates any bumping of items against it and the only ""pressure"" on it is the 10 ounces of soap in it. It is a waste of money unless you enjoy the clean up under your sink."
3,Hope the replacement lasts longer than the original!,"Although I'm very glad to have found this exact replacement for a detergent dispenser that broke after several years of gentle use, and the new one does fit properly into my Corian counter's existing hole, I am concerned lest it too may fail prematurely (inasmuch as it seems to be constructed exactly like its predecessor).Here's hoping!Update (May 7, 2012) So far it's going strong so the early demise of the original one may have been a fluke."
5,Soap dispenser,Excellent product my client loved the color as it matched the rest if her kitchen fixtures. My local vendors do not carry this color locally so it was nice to be able to get this product very quickly. We installed the same day it arrived and had no problems.
3,A little expensive for something with internal plastic construction,"This dispenser is attractive and works great.However, should you ever need replacement parts, they are ridiculously expensive and you can only get them through Delta at their MFSR price + shipping and handling. Because of the exorbitant price of the parts I opted to purchase the entire assembly rather than just the two parts I needed. The reservior bottle is constructed of soft plastic, the stanchion it screws into is made of a thin and very brittle plastic. The bottle got stripped and the stanchion cracked...apparently the bottle does not need to be firmly screwed in--which is not mentioned in the instructions.A more solid interior construction would be ideal especially for the purchase price...and Amazon's price was far better than everyone elses. 3 stars because the weak construction and outrageous price, otherwise it is a great product."
4,Delta soap dispenser,"The delivery was much sooner than I expected, and the quality was excellent. Being a 'Delta' product, who would expect less?"
1,glassner mesopotamia chronicles,"poor, weak, redundant and confusing at the least, not an interesting book at all. will not recommend it, or read it anew, mostly jiberish, repeat of half tales. of little interest."
4,Inexpensive and fun,"This is a surprisingly fun toy for the price. The chest lights up depending upon which armor you put on it - blue or green. And you can make it light up without the armor. It does assemble so some care would need to be used when playing or pieces might fall off. But for the price, it's been a worthwhile purchase."
4,Neat light up feature,"This was a great purchase at about four dollars. Some of the pieces fall off easily, which I have found to be pretty typical for these dragon toys. The light-up belly is my children's favorite part. It's a good addition to our collection."
3,A complete book for improving your game,"Unlike the other book on ultimate (by Studarus), this one assumes from the outset that you are already pretty familiar with the game and the terminology. This book concentrates on techniques, skills, and drills to improve both individual skills and team play. The writing is good and the diagrams are nice.I have only two criticisms of the book. The first is that the ""entry bar"" is pretty high: for example, if you don't know what an inside-out break-mark throw is at the outset, you'll need to spend a bit of time paging through the glossary, and if you don't know how to throw a hammer, this book won't help you. The second is that the writing occasionally gets long-winded, and you may discover you've just read four whole pages of prose that seem to just boil down to pithy advice like ""when marking, keep your weight above your feet and stay balanced"".Despite these criticisms, the book is good, and there is a lot of material here I haven't seen elsewhere in print."
2,Not a Good History Book,"This is a long boring tome on Malaysian history filled with a plethora of incomprehensible names of people and places. The minute details, instead of enlightening, cause one to find it hard not to fall asleep - much less make any sense out of what the authors are trying to relate. The 344 pages of text could have been easily reduced by 50%, thus making the book much easier to read & understand. The authors swamp the reader with so many useless insignificant details that it is almost impossible to glean any useful information from this tediously long book. Given the fact that this gobbledygook is a 2nd edition, the first having been written 20 years ago, it is hard to believe that there could have been much demand for a revised look at Malaysia's history. I had hoped to use this book in one of my university history courses on Southeast Asia. There is no way I would inflict such esoteric pedagogic claptrap on my students."
3,Contingent...,"Alot of information that you may not care for if you really want to know about the people of Malaysia per say. I do recommend it however, if you are interested in why another part of the world withdraws from Western culture, or why Western influence is so prominent in Malaysia."
4,Extremely important book but rather dated.A must read though,"This is an excellent historical introduction to Malaysia's past. It is a must read for anyone interested on Malaysia. However, if you are looking for an history of history writing and historical interpretation in Malaysia in this book then you would be disappointed. We usually wish a lot more from such a good book. Nonetheless, the book badly needs a revised edition, after it appeared nearly 16 years ago. A solid contribution."
1,THE Survival Guide: Home Remodeling by Diane Plesset,"Before buying the book I've read reviews, which now I guess are the fake; I wished to buy the best one, so it was the most expensive. It must be the best. Unfortunately, it is probably the worst....... AUTHOR DOES NOT KNOW THE SUBJECT! She just dances around, but never seriously touches it. To fill out the space,she'll show some cartoons with herself on each page(10%), make you complete some surveys(15%), put some irrelevent drowings(10%), give some quotations from outstanding personalities, tell hearsays, and fables (the rest 65%). I received it an hour ago, and immediately returning it. Joseph Zacharow, May 19th, 2006.("
3,Dunkirk with a Twist,"Hitler can't decide whether to put Britain away or make a separate peace but to make the most of his choices, on his own terms, takes advantage of British/French chaos as the 1940 blitz throws them back against the Atlantic seawall to launch a surprise raid aimed at quelling Britain's air defenses. Donaldson writes literately and he knows how to tell a story. The book is well paced, tense, interesting. It's main drawback is the lack of any identfiable protagonist. The action mainly follows what the Germans are up to, and though tough and resourceful, there's no way you pull for any of them. That's what separates this book -- and it is a good read -- from Jack Higgins' superior effort, WHERE EAGLES LAND, which is distinguished by more solid and interesting characterization."
5,A Local take,"I may be writing this because I'm a life long Vernon resident, or that I am very interested in history, but I highly recommend this book for everyone. It shows the slow transition of Anytown, USA: from small farming village, to large farming township, to the coming of the railroad, which brought on a massive mining buisness, and then the introduction of the automobile, which brought tourism: two ski resorts (Well, more like one and a half nowadays) and even a water park. This is a must read for North Jersey residents, and it makes and excellent coffee table book for the locals. This is the book for history buffs who prefer looking to reading."
5,Brilliant dialogue between Thomas Aquinas and Husserl,"Knowledge and Faith contains both the Catholic and secular (edited for publication) versions of Stein's comparison and combination of philosophers Edmund Husserl and Thomas Aquinas. While these two are quite different on the surface (as the progenitors of phenomenology and Thomism, respectively), Stein manages to place them in immediate confrontation and display an amazingly keen understanding of both. This is, in some ways, not surprising since she was both a student of Husserl (who deserves the credit for actually saving much of his work) and a follower of the Catholic Church of which Thomas Aquinas is a ""doctor"".There is also an essay on Pseudo-Dionysius included, but I recommend this book primarily as a must-read for those who wish to understand the intersection of Thomism and phenomenology)."
3,I was expecting more!,"The size is good but I was expecting it to be a little bigger than it was. More room for 2 people to lay on.I thought the spot in the middle was open to the pool, but it was netting and although water could come through,it would have been nice if you could have put your legs down into the pool in the middle. It's difficult to geton and off. I guess I was expecting it to be different than it was. It seems durable enough and I do like the factthat it has a place for you to put a drink. Other than that it was just ok, I wasn't blown away by this product. Iprobably would prefer a regular air mattress for floating in the pool. This was a little too bulky for me."
2,Very dated & boring,"It moved rather slow & did not have much to say. If you are interested in pre-wwII portugal, you may like it."
4,GERD sufferers unite!,This book has good information and decent menu ideas. Not too much that I didn't already know.Recommended to GERD sufferers.
4,Good information,I was looking for good information about acid reflux and recipes and got both. Very helpful and easy to follow recipes.
2,Didn't find this very useful,"I don't think I will use this cookbook, the recipes seem to be complex and not something I would normally cook. Wish I hadn't wasted my $$"
4,You don't have to have acid reflux to enjoy this book,"There is a lot of good advice on reducing acid reflux and leading a healthier life style in general(although nothing will make me quit smoking) in this book. There are whole sections devoted to treatments, including alternatives to surgical procedures. Even more important, for a foodie like me, are many mouth-watering recipes that are low-fat in addition to low-acid: everything from soup to nuts (literally). I would serve these to guests that do not have acid reflux. Without giving anything away, I hope, ""Green beans with Pecans and Warm Honeyed Apple Dressing"" and ""Sesame Chicken Satays with Peanut Sauce"" are among the 100 recipes included in this book."
4,Looking over his shoulder,"A woman was recently found dead in her home after publishing tell-all accounts of life inside the mob. One might wonder if Fopiano has been running for cover himself.This book would make an interesting and complementary addition to a collection including such books as Black Mass by O'Neill and Lehr. It discusses New England organized crime in particular and even touches on inside knowledge of the JFK assassination.It is an o.k. but more valuable for its local historical flavor, even though some of the organized crime tapestry is not entirely accurate."

1,ZERO STARS!!!!!!,"The item sent was terrible! Should not be called a briefcase. Very poor quality and not at all functional. Did not come close to the picture. No outside or inside pockets, not sturdy. Looked like something I could find at the dollar store. Do not purchase."
1,Broken,"That item came broken and dont look same than picture dont convince me , look very simple , so i did return ."
4,very cheap briefcase,"I was looking for a good cheap briefcase. I like the color and so far it has held up well. The price was very good at only $16.00. I was very impressed with that. It seems to be made of polyester and plastic, so I hope it holds up well."
5,Excellent Nylon Briefcase,"Excellent nylon briefcase. It's a perfect size and nice and light. It's almost exactly like my old one which lasted for many years. There are numerous pockets to hold things like business cards, cell phone, pens and a clip to hold your keys. I also like the feature where you can unzip a flap at the bottom of the main section which will open up the bag making it 2 inches wider to hold more stuff. My only complaint is it doesn't stand up on its own; it just flops over on its side. But that not a big deal. Its a great bag for the price"
1,Think Twice before buying LaCie,"I purchased a LaCie NAS drive from [...] approximately 18 months ago. The product had several shortcomings including the inability to back-up files that did not meet its highly restrictive file name rules. This turned out to be nearly half of my files. The documentation with the product was terrible. Now, 18 months later, the drive ceases to function and LaCie refuses to repair it because:""Unfortunately, LaCie does not handle out-of-warranty repairs. It isusually not cost effective to repair electronics since the price for newdrives has come down and the capacity has increased"".I can understand a response like this on a $99 product but not a $600 NAS. My advice: Don't buy LaCie!"
2,fabric oh no,These panties are very beautiful but very cheap made! I wore mine once & within an hour of having them on the fabric was tearing away from the seam at the top so beware!
5,A Fantasy Come True,"These crotchless panties are perfect for creating one of your favorite fantasies. They are comfortable, look good, the perfect price, and really are one size fits all. They come in several colors and the sequins really sparkle when the light hits them just right. They look as good in daylight as they do in candlelight. They must be handwashed because they are too delicate to be put in the washing machine."
4,Theyre cute,"Im 120 lbs and 5""2. I usually wear womens petite size small and these fit me just right. I like them . Im gonna order some more."
4,Perfect!,"These crotchless panties are perfect, just for a little spice to the everday routine. It cover nicely on top and the beads and sequins give the butterfly the right sparkle."
3,Good Read.,Paradigm by Robert Taylor is a good read if you have an interest in the markets. Some parts are a little rambliing and descriptions are a little excessive. gem
2,What a Disappointment,"Are these reviewers reading the same book that I'm reading? This seems like a way to sell the author's website info, and try to make a million in the stock market. The read is not that good. If you are reading it for the ""Taylor Effect"" information, that's one thing. If you want a good mystery read, I certainly would not recommend it. There are too many coincidences in the book, and the supposed brilliant characters can't put them together. In addition, I have never seen so many misspellings, incomplete sentences and generally bad grammar in a published work. The only reason I give this two stars is the book's descriptions of the geographical locations and attractions."
5,Riveting!,"I only read this book on the suggestion of my husband who was fascinated by the ""Taylor Effect"" on the World Market and Economy. Once I started the novel, I could not put it down. One mystery reveals five more! I was so caught up in the lives of the characters that I actually wanted to warn them when another twist was coming in the plot! The technical data and explanations given at the back of the book need some economical and mathematical knowledge for complete understanding, but the novel itself is good, fast-paced,interesting reading. In fact, you will not be able to stop reading until the surprising last paragraph hits you with full force!"
2,Unfortunate Last Ride of the Dalton Gang,"There were many accurate accounts but I did not enjoy the way they portrayed Grat, nor the way they made light of may situations, also the supporting music was corny (comic)."
1,RIP OFF,RIP OFF. I thought it would be 6 pky. of worms. Instead I got one pkg. of 6. You can buy these retail for 3.99 a pky. VERY MISLEADING.
4,tight but it fits......,"The tags and information all say its for 14 inch laptops....I looked at size of the computer pouch inside and it seemed like it would fit...it being a 15.4 inch thinkpad T61. It does fit tightly, I mean snug. I like pockets/organizers and the ability to switch the dominate sholder. The brown & tan colors beat the black computer bags that most people seem to have. I have LowePro Camera bags and LoweAlpine backpack that have never let me down so i'm sure this computer messenger bag will join them."
1,Garbage,"Never wanted to send a movie back to Amazon but this one should go back and in the trash.. slow moving, boring, didn't keep my attention... throwing in a few african americans actors that we know is not going to make the movie... What is this suppose to be the men's version of Waiting to Exhale? NOT! Terrence you and Glenn aren't ready to be producers yet...keep your day jobs of acting..."
1,Was this film for real?,"As a viewer from the U.K. it can be quite difficult acquiring African-American films. I really do enjoy watching this type of film, but I can honestly say that watching this could have put me off for life.All of the men in the film were in serious need of medical attention and all of the women were acting no better than women employed in the oldest profession (only they weren't getting paid for it). The men were suffering from so much fustration, anger and agression that you could not understand what they were saying half of the time.You had to watch the film about 3 times just to understand it (and that's if you could stay awake for long enough).It was lucky to even get one star in the rating and I think that I did you all a favour by watching it and reviewing it so you wouldn't have to.To summarise,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. getting this one."
4,A Funny Review of Fantastic Four 2,"Length:: 3:55 MinsThe following is a review of the film, NOT the DVD (so I do not cover extras and whatnot). It is also a SKETCH COMEDY MOVIE REVIEW! The comedy was improv.Also note: The comics clearly served as inspiration for this movie, but it is no way an adaptation of said comics. Thus, I judge the movie based on what it was trying to do, not what kind of FF film fans had hoped to see. Thx!"
3,im waiting,i have the power golactic version on reg dvd hoping for the widescreen blu ray version golactic
3,A step up and a fun kids film.,"""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" is large step up from it's goofy predecessor. It has higher production values (better special effects, cleaner editing, bigger action scenes, less cheesy moments) and most importantly a cohesive and efficient plot. With a better script the actors have better material to work with, therefore don't seem so out of place. You believe the dynamic of the team much more in this picture. Again, this series is aimed at kids and teens and I still stand by that as a good idea. While it takes away from adults enjoyment of the series, it's good harmless fun for the kids"
2,They got the Surfer right...but thats about it,"Fans of the Fantastic Four fall into two catagories. The first being those who grew up with the comics and the second, the younger generation of movie goers that Hollywood is desperate to grab.For some reason, Stan Lee of Marvel comics fame, seems to want to re-engineer all the old classic comic stories to gain a young audience, while at the same time just throwing tid-bits to the older generation.So, you have a Reed Richards that becomes the stereotypical ""nerdy scientist"", an endlessy and tiring cocky Human Torch and a Victor VonDoom who is so miscast that none of the fans like him.That being said, I am grateful they got the Silver Surfer somewhat on par as to what he was in the original comic.If you know nothing about this movie and dont mind a comic book story made somewhat silly, then you might enjoy it.If your an older fan of the comic...you will be shaking your head in disappointment"
1,atrocious,"I'm guessing the actors couldn't have gotten that much worse, so I guess it was the writing; the plot was weak, trying to be character-driven and epic at the same time, but failing entirely with the characters. I'm pretty sure the special effects were worse (Johnny seemed to look hokier with all his up-close flame-ons). The most redeeming quality of the first movie, its humor, was also sorely lacking--or just not hitting the right notes."
3,"A good, fun film","I enjoyed watching Rise of the Silver Surfer. I first watched it onboard a JetBlue aircraft and it was very entertaining. I am an avid fan of superheroes, so my bias is obvious. However, the Fantastic Four are not my favorite heroes and I do think this movie was similarly campy as the first installment. The appearance of Silver Surfer was a nice addition, but he did not raise the level of this film to that of Batman Begins or Spider-Man. Ultimately, this film was fun to watch and it's almost always good to see the comic book heroes in live-action. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer delivered those heroes in a fun and entertaining way. It is worth your time to see."
3,Isn't a wedding stressful enough?,"It's the fourth time Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) are going to tie the knot. This time, Reed's not going to let a petty little thing like an alien invasion get in the way. Sue won't let him.So he sneaks around to develop the system to track the alien--unfortunately, the call interrupts the wedding...again.Turns out, space tyrant Galactus is back and he's sent his minion Silver Surfer (voice by Laurence Fishburne) as his precursor. He's out to destroy the Earth and a newly resurrected Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) is going to help.Reed and Sue, who are about to break up the Four for a normal life and children, realize they cannot save the world on their own.The film was interesting, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the first ""Fantastic Four."" The teamwork and the use of powers in this film was better; however, Von Doom just made me think of a poorly executed homage to Emperor Palpatine from ""Star Wars."""
5,Fantastic Movie for all fans of Science Fiction and Cimics.,"I viewed the movie when it was first released in theaters, and I was pleasently surprised. The costumes and special effects are first class. In fact, most of the people in the theater were in awe in the initial appearance of the Silver Surfer. The story line is not perfect, but it is entertaining and fast moving. There is considerable more action in this movie than in the first one. I highly recommend this movie to all that wish to be entertained by a solid theatrical presentation."
2,Complete Sell-out,"First you take a good idea for a movie, then you add two good actors and a bunch of mediocre actors, then you stuff as many product placements in to the movie as humanly possible, then add 1000% more product placement. Next, because your from hollywood, you depict the US government as evil torture-happy war mongers who can and do send troops to any country in the world including Russia and there you are. You have Fantastic Four II.Im surprised in the movie poster Jessica Alba isnt holding a Pepsi while the Silver Surfer is wearing Reeboks. The Fantasic Car has a Dodge emblem on it for crying out loud This could have been a good movie, but it isnt. Not by a long shot."
4,Excellent movie and Blu Ray Disc,I saw this movie at the theatre and thought it was really good. I then was psyched when I saw that it was being released on Blu Ray. The video and sound are even better than what I would have expected. This is a must own for any fan of comic book movies or if you want to show off your blu ray player.
1,Deserves Less,I would give this a negative review if possible. This flick is not worth any comic book fans time. Might be watchable for the average viewer.
2,Piss poor cast..,"With the exception of Michael Chiklis, this cast just plain sucks. They bring nothing to the table as far as individual character. The story line is lackluster as well. I don't know why they would even bother to make another."
4,Wow! All these super powers are sooo cool!!!,"This movie's plot is well constructed. I would rather watch this exciting 1.5-hour movie than a flabby two-hour movie. The Silver Surfer is an intrigueing character and audiences will have great fun watching him and the rest of the characters play with their powers. This is not a very deep movie, just great fun. Besides, does a movie really need to be deep to be worth watching?"
5,The Maginfacant Four Are Back!!!,My mom rented this movie from Netflix and wanted me to see the 2nd Sequel that she & my dad so it in Theatres.The 2nd Sequel was pretty good better than the first one.The Silver Surfer comes down to earth do his job to destory the world.He tells Sue that he isn't the one detorying their that he's working for another planet to help destory their world.And the evil Dr.Victor Von Doom comes back to get his revenge on the Fantastic Four to try to take over the world or destory it.My favorite part of the movie when Reed & Sue get married at the end of the movie.I always liked Johnny in the Fantasic Four he cracks me up that he is such a clown.I like to get The Rise of the Silver Surfer on DVD it's like worth the money.
2,The Thing is not Jar Jar Binks,"The fan base of the FF cannot show up in numbers to support the special effects budget so again the Hollywood formula is applied. The gratuitous product placement is an inside joke as Johnny is behind it. Here are our new uniforms sponsored by the Keebler Elves!!!This movie has no idea who or what it is trying to appeal to. Part action, part slapstick, part grossout (burp jokes etc) even a wedding for the girls...Dr Dumb is no better in this one, only the surfer is well done. I thought Galactus would show up with a Taco Bell sign for a hat, but he is not shown.The Dodge logo on the Fantasticar was pretty much the low point of the film, that the 'Stretchdance' and bad actress Alba catching fire and burning off her clothes.Thanks for renting this for only 99c Amazon."
4,Silver Surfer rules,This movie is freakin awesome great CG effects. Watching Silver Surfer on the big screen is worth the purchase alone he looks great. If you enjoyed the first movie like I did then you'll like this one.
4,Terriffic Story line,"I like the way the story line went from start to finish. The dialogue was excellent. If you did not know the real deal, the story could have been about life itself."
5,very good,this dvd movie arrive a little late but it was in excellent condition and it played well in my dvd player.
1,The Surfer,"I don't like the surfer here. His design is overdone (a wildly, monsterlike screaming surfer?) and he lost his noble and deep-thinking attitude. I always thought that this character was so far ahead of all other superheroes, because of his selfreflecting, balanced being, intellect, heart, (plus, of course: his superpowers). I prefer the older stuff you can get on utube to this one."
3,fantastic four-rise of the silver surfer,Grandsons enjoyed this last viewing of the fantastic four.They are looking forward to the next one.
1,Fantastic Four: Rise of the Super Nerds,"After watching the first film, I dared to hope that the second would be more impressive. Alas, I hoped in vain. Apparently the filmmakers' goal was to produce a film that just wasn't spectacular, as almost every action sequence fell just short of WOW!. Also, I didn't care about the relationship between Mr. Fantastic and Susan Storm, and frankly, the age difference between them is more than a little creepy. What really ruined this film for me was the LAUGHABLE special effects. I can't recall the last time I saw a film with such poor special effects. The most interesting character in the story was the Silver Surfer. The whole plot line of the Von Doom was ridiculously predictable. I think this film would be most enjoyable to its obvious target audience of 12-14 year olds."
1,If I could unwatch it I would,"They should really decide whether they want to produce dramatic sitcoms or faithful action comic movies. Stop trying to split the difference to please the lowest common denominator of society. I can't believe anyone would be so shallow as to be pleased by this movie. Please make it into a half hour action special and cut out all the shallow ""Bridzilla"" Sue and ""Jersey Shore"" Johnny drama."
1,A GENEROUS ONE STAR,"No Plot, terrible dialogue, awful characters... Might appeal to a 3-4 year old child, just because of the bright colors and loud noises. This was even worse than the first Fantastic Four."
3,"Good, but not great","This movie continues the Fantastic Four series, but adds very little to it. There are some great special effects, a cameo of Stan Lee, and a lot of typical ""military officers are torturing, arrogant, men with big egos"" garbage. The idea of taking a prisoner to Sibera to be tortured while being watched by US military people is amazingly stupid for so many reasons I almost shut it off right there.There are some good moments and this movie is worth watching, but I regret buying it and it is on my ""trade"" shelf waiting for a chance to step up to something else."
5,IT'S FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!,I really enjoyed the movie and the silver surfer was nice creation the enemy part. Also this movie more exciting than first one. I like comic movie series. Hopely they have more story going on.
3,Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.,Aaron A. Little 1-29-2008.Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.I thought it was as good as it could possible be. There were things about it I liked and things I didn't like. What I like was the F/X and the Silver Surfer himself the dancing scene with Mr. Fantastic was very funny and the chase scene with the Human Touch was good. The main problem with this whole sires is Doctor Doom and the Invisible Woman.Over all I wood give this a 7/10 or three stars '''.
1,Just boring,I confess that as a kid I liked the Fantastic Four but this series is just boring.The story made little sense. Some incredible cosmic surfer is going around the Earth destroying. Then a villain so easily gets into the good books of the US military. They accept him and with the fantastic four quickly overpower the surfer. Then this villain becomes the surfer and so on till finally the beautiful sweet Jessica Alba convinces the surfer to change sides and save the Earth. Maybe a kid would make sense of it. I did not.None of the characters were interesting. None acted well.Quite surprising for a big budget US movie the actual special effects were nothing special.
1,I paid $0.99 for it and couldn't watch more than 15 minutes,"OMG, this is one of those movies that I rented because I was curious to see if it was as bad as I thought it would be. Well the answer is I downloaded it to watch on Amtrak, and in the end I found watching traffic on I-55 more interesting than this movie."
2,Skip It,This movie starts out with the FF flying coach and goes downhill from there. Horrible writing. Horrible. All the good action scenes were in the trailer. Watch the trailer on youtube and skip this one.
4,Light entertainment,"This is a fun effects movie. If you are looking for drama, or you want to be intellectually challenged, or if you are outraged by departure from the source material in movies, this is not for you.If you are looking for a couple of hours of entertainment, you may like it as much as I did.The main characters play better this time around. As the actors have now known each other for years, they play off each other with the familiarity the characters would have. This is a significant interpersonal improvement in the acting."
2,Missed Opportunity,"I have in a box in my garage all the Fantastic Four comics that have the Silver Surfer in them and issues 1-15 of the Surfer comics themselves. I was really ready for this movie.What a disappointment! 90% of the movie is banal, uninteresting dialogue. The acting is weak. The sequences with the Surfer are stunning and the movie begs for more interaction with his character and more action between the FF and him.The end is simply a colossal disappointment. I can only guess they ran out of special effects funding before the movie was over and had to end quickly and without a grand battle. As you see the Surfer floating is space, you can almost imagine him saying ""I can't believe I let them blow this movie like this.""Two stars for the Surfer sequences, nothing for the rest. Save your money. Move along. Nothing to see here!"
3,"So Many Super Heroes, So Little Time...","I would have felt cheated if I had paid to see this in the cinema. Thanks to Netflix, I saved ten bucks. Many of the reviews here seem to be longer than the screenplay. This is a film with delightful visuals but without a good plot, what is the point? We need super heroes to save us from pirates masquerading as film producers."
3,Meh to A-OK,"This movie has its high and low points. The extras provided in the two-disc Power Cosmic edition are OK, but nothing really spectacular. If you're a casual fan of the comics, this movie does some things really well but as a comic book film it doesn't stand up well in comparison to films like The Dark Knight or The Avengers. It doesn't help that the filmmakers copped out a bit on the Galactus villain. However, the Silver Surfer stuff is pretty well done and once the movie ramps up, it is a fun ride."
3,What Happened on audio?,"I did not enjoy this as much as the first one. I seen it on DVD for the 1st time after watching the original again,back to back night. I also did not like how this was not recorded in DTS like the first movie had a option of DTS 5.1....after getting a new surround system last month I find the DTS movies sound better than the basic DD5.1...I am repurchasing the Jurassic Park 1+2 movies in DTS now,although it took me a while to find some left over in DTS."
2,Really Awful,Terrible movie. Not a good comic book movie or adventure movie by any standards (even the lowest standards). It's painful to watch. The acting is horrible and there is really no action. It's just dumb bickering and stupid jokes. The Thing costume looks absolutely horrible. Jessica Alba's hair looks faker than Pam Anderson's headlights. Avoid at all costs.The Stan Lee & Jack Kirby comics that the movies are based on are much more entertaining and considered part of the classic codex of comics history. Why not read those? Are we that illiterate as a society that comic books are too hard to read and we have to watch awful movies?
3,Good Special Effect. Worth renting.,It has good special effect. It's neither better nor worse than the previous installments. It's worth renting.
4,The Silver Surfer steals the show!,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer brings to the screen the continuing adventures of four of the most well known, and most well loved, superheroes out of the pages of Marvel comics.Just as the Fantastic Four are settling into their role as the world's guardians a new arrival of cosmic proportions will shake them up...Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.The acting is good, the special effects are excellent, and the plot is quite interesting.In a nutshell, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!"
2,Blue (Da Ba Dee),I was very dissappointed with this movie. I really didn't care for the first one either. Silver Surfer is pretty good though. What's up with Galactus? That wasn't the Galctus i grew up reading about. I also believe they could have found a part for Linda Cardellini. Maybe the third one will be better.
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge Marvel fan, enjoy Fantastic Four although they are not my favorite, but this movie is just terrible. And it is a shame, because Silver Surfer is a fascinating character. That is the only reasons it gets two stars and not one."
3,Fantastic Four- Rise of the Silver Surfer,"Got this movie for my son and found myself enjoying it as well. Cast was great, lots of action. Fun movie!"
5,The Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer,"While I am a fan of Marvel Comics, this was one of the finest Marvel products brought to the big screen. This is far better than the first FF movie from 1994. Marvel continues to improve the movies they produce and this was one of the better ones. My only problem with the movie was that Galactus was ""in the movie"" it would have gone over much better to actually see or hear him. While i do realize the enormous cost the production company would have to endure to add him to the movie as well as increasing the length of the movie to really tell the story of the herald and his master it would have been well worth it. All in all a great comic book brought to life. Make mine Marvel!"
2,Fantstic 4 not that fantastic.,"Though Marvel has hit recent home runs with Iron Man and Incredible Hulk, their Fantastic 4 movies have a lot to be desired for. The Silver Surfer just looks to CGI and there just doesn't seem to be anything worth while going on in the movie. There doesn't seem to be any chemistry between Sue Storm and Mr. Fantastic, mostly due to no real characterization in this or the first movie. They intend to get married through out the film,which just doesn't work for a this second film. Maybe if there would be a third movie, do it there, but with no chemistry between the actors and actresses, no great action sequences, the film seems to fall flat."
3,"Better than the first...but then again, that wasn't a hard task","This movie was better than the first movie. But going from really bad to average isn't hard in regards to a sequel. FF4 brings back the original cast with the addition of the silver surfer. I have been reading comics since a little boy all the way until the present day so when I see the characters brought to life it amazes me (especially Silver surfer). Silver surfer made the movie for me. From the way he looked, fought, and using laurence fishburne to provide a great voice for the CG character. The story was ok, had a decent amount of action, as well as a decent amount of comedy. Overall the movie isn't bad and is worth seeing."
4,Light...Fluffy...Fun,"Much better than the first film, which I found somewhat amusing. Jessica Alba is always a treat to look at, not to mention the whole cast just has better chemistry this time around. The CGI is good for the most part, as is the humor. It's nice to see a comic book movie not take itself too seriously for a change.FF4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a fun way to spend 90 minutes.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars"
3,Surfer crashed and burned,"Okay did you ever sit through a movie and think afterwards, did I miss something? Well in this latest installment of Fantastic Four, you miss any real story or character development. You don't feel much in the way of emotions, and although the effects are decent there certainly isn't anything to text home about. Overall watchable, just not what you hoped for from these comic book characters. I personally was not thrilled with the idea of wrapping the main story of Silver Surfer with the wedding of Richards and Storm. I'd be lying if I said I liked it better than the last Spiderman. I would hope there will be a third movie and they will work harder to develop the story and characters. I sure didn't feel much about the Silver Surfer one way or another."
4,Very enjoyable!,"It wasn't what I expected. I decided to give it a try finally, even if I heard a lot of negative reviews. I think I can understand the hate if you're a hardcore F4 fan that wants everything to be exactly how it is in the comic. If Stan Lee approves I'm alright with it. If you step back and just try to enjoy a fun movie then it's all good."
4,Fantastic shipping,Good quality item. I did not rate it as excellent because some parts in the movie seems to skip and lose image quality. But for the price is a good buy.
4,Silver Surfer Fantastic,"I enjoyed the Rise of the Silver Surfer-Fanstastic 4 Two more than the first series mainly because of the Silver Surfer character. As my youngest child stated, ""Silver Surfer is awesome"", I have to agree. I never knew too much about the Silver Surfer character or story before I watched this movie but the story of his origin(although far-fetched even as superhero goes) is very interesting to say the least. I have to think he would have to rank as 1 of the more powerful superhero after seeing what he is capable of in this movie adaptation, well at least as long he's attached to his surfboard which is his power source. Anyways, I enjoyed this movie & I got it at an unbelievable price brand new which made it doubly more fun to watch."
3,Unusually weak for a blockbuster movie.,"The truth is I don't expect much from comic book movies: flashy special effects, over-the-top plot lines, sympathetic if simplistic characters, and a decent adrenaline rush. ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" fails to provide even that much.It's not so much a problem of writing or characterization--which are both poor compared to something like Spider-Man 2; the problem is that somehow, the movie lacks dramatic weight. It just didn't make me care about the events or the characters...or even the action. While the various cartoons don't really have any more dramatic weight, they have more humor, and only had to sustain the plot for 30 or 60 minutes.For the record, I've always found the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer to have some of the weaker plot lines among the Marvel characters; I've long found the X-Men stories to be the most satisfying. Still, this version of the Fantastic Four leaves much to be desired."
1,Not so Fantastic,"What a terrible movie. Aside from the poor acting, even basic editing was lacking in this comic movie. Even if the story was acceptable and not a rip off of old Superman movie themes, the directors couldn't even get basic editing accurate. For instance, when the four star general first makes his appearance, aside from the fact that they couldn't get his shoulder straps to lay down, we expect that he and his staff will perform their roles with some basic respect for the military. So when the general shows up later with a measley two stars on his beret flash, it is apparent no one cares about detail in this comical farce. Waste...."
2,"Cute, but I kept looking at my watch","I think I knew what I was getting into with this one having seen the original, but wow was it ""lite."" Really, nothing fantastic about it."
3,Just So-So Film,"The special effects, cinematography, and the ""Silver Surfer"" stole the show in this movie. Otherwise not much else even worth writing home about in my opinion.The acting was alright and so was the storyline was VERY predictable and very boring TOO BOOT!! Flimsy dialogue between the characters themselves was also awful.I found the whole getting married thing between Reed Richards & Sue Storm to be completely annoying and distracting.... This is an action/sci-fi film, not a romance film, so who even cares if they even get married anyway."
1,Product Placement Masquerading As A Motion Picture,"What more can be said? Yeah the Surfer looks cool, but he has to hang out with the lame, lame, lame Fantastic (?) Four from the first movie. Poor writing coupled with lazy direction through the prism of Fox executives who only cared about making another cash grab equals a heartless, stupid movie.I do love the unintentional laughs created anytime Jessica Alba attempts to emote during her heart-to-hearts with the Surfer. This bimbo clearly has no idea she can't act."
3,Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"I enjoyed the first movie, I thought it was a lot of fun. This one was just alright, it had better actoin but wasn't as fun. I liked the first movie slightly better."
2,"blu-ray or not, it's a stupid movie","My family enjoyed the first Fantastic Four. As I was flying home from Las Vegas, this was the inflight movie and I was so disappointed. All comic-based movies are a bit ""different"", but this crossed that line from being comic-y to just plain stupid. MAKE THIS A RENTAL! I'm sure it looks awesome in blu-ray but you couldn't pay me to watch this more than once."
4,nicely dumb CGI'd Surfer,"Fans of the comic book series will debate this one, but for my money, it is a great, overloaded-with-CGI piece of shallow, mindless junk that is just fun, fun, fun. Marvel's weakness is that the cinematic feel of their old Kirby/Stan Lee comics were mighty stuff for twelve cents in 1964, but are superficial in 2007 on a big screen. BUT it works here for a dumb, childish faux-epic that owes more to some geek doing computer graphics than complimentary scriptwriting.Dr Doom is back, but Galactus is some shapeless whatever: BIG disappointment. Jessica Alba looks like a 13 year old in her mommy's makeup; a really awkward choice. Introduces the FF flying fortress: nice work for a classic bit of comic history. Captures the feel of the 60's comic book very well: have some popcorn and go brainless for two hours."
3,More Fun Than I Expected,"I like a superhero movie that can have a little fun with the archetypes, and with what happens when super-powered people try to live ""normal"" lives and have ""normal"" events like weddings. I still think Jessica Alba is miscast, but not as miscast as Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane."
4,Decent flick,"Pretty good movie. I really enjoyed the Silver Surfer, the effects were well done and did not detract from the movie. They are doing a great job of bringing the comic book characters to life!"
3,Distracting entertainment,"I have been criticized for liking the first Fantastic Four movie, and while I acknowledge it's flaws, and wishing it was truly more like the John Byrne ear of the comic book, I was entertained, which was enough. Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer both surpasses, and falters from the original. While the characters are more refined, Susan Storm's turning into the cliche girl who wants the boy to stay out of harm was boring, and in contradiction with the first. However, the silver surfer was amazing, both visually and as a character, practically stealing the movie. And to all of you complaining about galactus, I think there was someone behind that cloud. But I digress. It's an entertaining movie, and well worth the price of admission. Give it a try."
5,Rise of the Silver Surfer,"It starts with great fast paced action and carries through to the very end. Amazing special effects and a good storyline. It is great family entertainment, a must have for any fan of comic books. The Power Cosmic edition has many features that were fun to watch such as how they filmed the silver surfer and then turned him into a completely cg character. Over all a great buy."
4,Rise of the Silver Surfer,Climatically Great to watch in the HD version. Growing Up and reading the comic book it is cool to see it as a movie.
4,cool,I've alway's loved super heroes but the fantastic four are one of the coolest super hero teams I've ever seen
3,Story is a little weak but good special effects,I found the surfer to be a little 2 dimensional but the effects were great and there were some funny moments in the movie. No where near as good as the more recent Avengers but still not a bad super hero flick and I picked it up at a cheap lightening deal price.
2,"Buy Later, Buy used, Save your money","Sadly, a Hollywood action/adventure formula-driven reanimation of a comic book classic. That I would actually use the phrase ""Comic Book Classic"" is sad in & of it's own. But, that coupled with the boring-to-death parroting of Hollywood's idea of what makes an action/adventure marketable, and I'm practically weeping openly for the demise of the Fantastic Four."
2,Only for Little Kids,Little kids might like it but for anyone over 12 it is pretty boring and predictable. The dialogue is ridiculous as others have stated.
2,Comic book or soap opera?,"Very weak movie. It's slow to get started and, when it does, the story is lame. I found myself getting confused as to whether this was supposed to be based on a comic book or a soap opera; the attempts to make the characters deep and conflicted fail badly. They should have stuck with making this an action movie.Very disappointing (not that the first FF movie was all that great to begin with).Not recommended."
3,Not so fantastic!,Please try the Kirby/Lee comics brfore you see this movie...then you'll know how good it COULD have been!
4,Fantastic 4-Rise of the Silver Surfer,"The first movie is well done, but I thought the Rise of the Silver Surfer is better yet, which is surprising considering second episodes usually aren't as better as the first. The powers of the 4 is the same, but there is a twist in this second, which is surprising, and I am one of those guys who likes surprises, especally in second movies. The Silver Surfer character has amazing powers and he uses them to the hilt at the end when he relearns compassion after worlds of mindless obedience. Great plot. Great story. Nice special effects. It was worth the wait to purchase on dvd."
1,"Misleading, Unhelpful, Not worth the money","I have not taken the test yet, but the questions in this book do not even resemble the question style of the study published by ACT (the company that publishes the official study guide and publishes the test). I have been leaving messages with someone at ARCO and no one has returned my calls. Like one of the other reviewers, I would like my money back."
1,Complete Waste of Money (not even worth 1 star!),"I bought this book in order to prepare for the Foreign Services Test, but I ended up ignoring it all together. The background information contained within this book was almost verbatium off of the ...website from the Foreign Services section.The only reason to purchase this book would be for the practice questions. However, I found at least 2 questions in the knowledge section were wrong, and another couple that contained typos that caused me to select the wrong answer. Thus, I questioned the whole legitimacy of the examine book. The English section is NOT reflective of the English section contained within the actual Foreign Services Examn, which was a complete SHOCK during exam day!...completely, useless book."
1,Almost worthless!!!!,"I am very disappointed in this book. As I remmeber, The first section is devoted to how to get into the Civil Service which is pretty worthless for someone looking into the Foreign Service.What was unpardonable is that I actually found one of there questions that has a wrong answer in the answer section. If you can not trust the answers they are giving you, then what is this book worth????I would like Arco to give me my money back. Or better yet - they should not be lazy and send someone to write a really good, up-to-date prep book. It seems to me they did a lot of cut and paste from the Department of State website, and gave no real time or efort to its preparation"
1,Useless,The people writing positive reviews must be from the publisher and have never taken the test. This was a real waste of money. The state department web site provides all the information that you really need to know and it's free.
2,Full of typos,"I take the exam tomorrow, so I don't know how relevant the questions are yet, but I am shocked by the number of typos that the book has. The book is full of misspellings, answers that don't match questions, and some very strangely worded questions. It's a shame that the only study guide for this test is so poorly edited."
1,No one can learn java from this book,A person trying to learn java from this book will be frustrated and lost by chapter 3 if not earlier. Components and structures are only mentioned and not explained as if just providing examples of java programs were sufficient. This is another one of those how-to book that is only understandable to a person who already knows the subject. Those who give this book high marks must either be friends of the author or already know java or both.
2,Just not good enough for a beginner,"The first couple of chapters are quite good, but then the author looses the plot in chapter three(Classes and Objects) where he seems to forget that he is supposed to be helping beginners to learn. The examples are vague and the explanations sketchy in an area that is key to this particular language. This chapter deserved much more in the way of elaboration on each of its sections, and concludes by expecting the hapless beginner to be able to jump from small code segments to a complete calculator application, using only a code outline for guidance. At this point, I just skimmed the remainder of the book, taking a couple of pointers here and there, but in the main this book is not focused enough for the experienced programmer, and jumps too quickly into heavy code for the beginner."
5,This is perfect,"This is a perfect product. I have been using them for a couple of years now and have not had a single problem. I must own over a dozen or so. It is a very high quality and stands up to the outdoor environment very well. I have left them outside over the NY winter without any problems. They don't leak and operate flawlessly.Of note, if this matters to you, they create a swivel joint that can be a pro or a con depending on the use. For my garden sprinkler, it is a pro because it prevents kinks in the hose. For my sprayer nozzle it is a con, because you need to screw the nozzle to open or close it - I need to be sure to hold the nozzle in the right place to operate it.Overall, I absolutely love this product and keep buying more for every new hose accessory I buy.Amazon sells a male/female set or a set of two males. The female end is for the spigot or end of the hose. The male end fits into your sprinkler, nozzle, or sprayer."
2,Disappointed,Seem to be OK but not as good as I expected. Looks like they have some problems with quality control. I had to file one of the male ends some before I could get it to go into the female connector. They are made in China now so what can you expect. Also I consider them to be overpriced for a Chinese import.
2,overpriced at 8plus,2pcs for pver 8...harbor freight has a 6pc set for a few cents more. i wish i'd of bght theirs. gotta be careful of amazon pricing.
1,CK Prostretch Boxer Brief Review,"Would not buy again. I have other CK underwear and have liked their products but this pair is very disappointing. They ""ride"" up in the worst kind of way. Not comfortable to wear."
4,Balanced Kit.,"This kit contains a little of everything, making it a very versatile addition to any toolbox. The tough case has room for another layer of extra bits you might have laying around. For the complainers ""Made in China"", sorry fellas but these are are made in the same place(s) and are the same quality as DeWalt, Makita, Bosch etc, ""drill bits are cheap"" then you don't know what you're doing and hex shank bits have an inherent weak point where the bit is attached to the shank. I've had these for a while and they've fared no better or worse than the other brands. They are, however, better than Harbor Freight, or Black & Decker bits. Funny how the complainers all say ""Chinese crap"" or ""drill bit broke"" but make no mention of the high quality Quik-Lok extension, the solid chuck adapter, convenient screw guide or the great case the bits come in. If one wants ultra-high quality bits look to Wera, made from high grade steel & manufactured in Germany, all for a premium price."
3,"nice bit set, but...",This is a nice bit set all except the quick lock for the impact driver only worked well for about a week and now it is sticking and not locking the bits in even after lubricating it.
3,Good selection of bits for my drill/driver,"I needed the sockets to drive some self tapping bolts, this kit does include the two most popular sizes which simplify the setup. I did notice the magnets in these bits was rather weak, so if I was slightly off-center when driving, the bolt would fall out. I liked the extensions, they came in handy, but the drill bits were brittle, easily broken, however I did not purchase this kit for the drill bits."
3,Quik-Lok is what you're buying,"Bought this set awhile back and all the thinner drill bits are broken, and you can't use regular drill bits. The drivers are basic stuff with several duplicates. Works to augment other sets, so what you're really buying it for is the quik-lok feature, which really only works with the longer bits pictured."
5,"I give it a ZERO for where it's made, but its a good set","If you can find a set not made in China, go for it, but this had the most for the buck. I'd prefer everyone boycott Chinese products. Bits are holding up to stresses well."
1,Probably the poorest quality product on the market today,"The only good part of the Milwaukee Quik-lok 38 piece drilling and bit set appears to be the plastic case holding the drill bits and driving bits.Unfortunately, the drill bits break within a few seconds of their first use and the driving bits also quickly break during either the first or subsequent use.Even at the price of $19.95, this kit is a waste of good money due to completely useless customer service."
5,Drilling and Driving Set,Great little kit that has many attachments and works with many other quick lock tools.
2,"One Bad Part, Poor Customer Service","I hadn't really tried to use this set of drills and drivers, but I found that one of the drill bits (1/4 inch) would not fit into the Milwaukee Compact Driver. I called Milwaukee Customer Service to ask for a replacement part, and was told that it was under a 30 day warranty and I needed to send it back to the vendor (Amazon).I complained that it seemed unreasonable to send the whole set back because of one part, but they said that was my only option to get the part replaced.The power tool is excellent but I will be getting driver bits and drill bits from other sources."
2,"Worth every penny, that is, if I paid 5 pennies for the kit","I bought this to complement my Milwaukee M12 cordless screwdriver. The drill bits suck big time. I only drill into wood with those bits and boy are they terrible!These are not to be used with an impact driver. The impact driver would destroy every piece in this kit! Since it is made in China/Taiwan, quality is not there. The only plus of this kit is how easy it is to remove and replace the individual bits. I have a Dewalt impact-ready drill bit kit and the bits in those are difficult to reinstall when done."
1,milwaukee cordless screwdriver bits.,Bought it a while back and any item with more than two moving parts fell apart.Surprised how any item with that logo could be so bad.Avoid.
5,Milwaukee 38-Piece Quik-Lok Hex Drill & Drive Bit Set,"Typical Milwaukee quality. Flawless execution in ever respect. Have never, ever been disappointed with a Milwaukee product."
1,The Drill bits are not straight.,"I bought this in July 2012. I used a 1/4"" drill bit yesterday, February 23,2013 for the first time. It was not straight, not even close. I got another bit from a different set (Dewalt) and finished my job. Today February 24, I checked the rest of the bits out. Not one was straight. I am waiting to hear from Milwaukee about what they will do.I was drilling soft wood, but if I had been drilling metal it could have been VERY dangerous. CHECK ALL BITS BEFORE USING!!! I am going back to Dewalt.2-26-2013: Milwaukee is sending me a new set. I will check them out as soon as I get them and make a new posting as to their straightness."
4,Very Usefull,"It is a perfect compliment to my milwaukee M12 combo drills. Comes with almost everything I need for around the house types of jobs. Only thing it is missing is a few larger diameter drill bits, but I just purchased a drill bit set to go with it."
4,"Pretty good, so far","I don't use my drill bits a lot, but when I do, I usually beat on them mercilessly. I have historically bought makita bits, since it's just what my drill and impact drivers are, but I've gone through so many bits I decided to switch it up this time.So far, we've gotten through an entire house refurbishing on this set, breaking only one bit. Granted I haven't pounded them hard yet, but they have taken some abuse, and taken it well. I'm impressed. I'd recommend giving these a shot if you're completely sick of breaking bits as I am."
4,Over all good book,"A good book. I was though hoping for something a little more indepth, but overall a well written and good book. Was an easy read. Just wished it was a more of it."
4,"weird mix of tunes, but it works!","Found this CD in the bargain bin of a local shop and thought I'd live dangerously and buy it, having only heard a few of the songs previously, such as Bonnie Raitt's great version of ""Lover's Will"", ""Tijuana Lady"" by Gomez and the tracks by Moby and Cracker. Perhaps my favorite song on this soundtrack, though is the opening the cut, the addictively cool ""Drinking in L.A."" by Bran Van 3000 ... whoever they are. I also really dig the tracks by Ben Lee and Charlie Haden. This is a weird mix of styles, walking the tightrope of various ""alternative"" branches, along with electronic, mainstream pop, jazz, and the obligitory instrumental film score. Never saw the film, but I'm impressed by the selection of songs on here."
4,Excellent,I left a copy of this book in an airport. I had to buy another copy in order to finish it. Loved the book.
2,S L O W-paced and rambling...,"I can't disagree with the other reveiwers who say that the author did a fine job researching the time period and setting. His descriptions were also beautifully detailed and you could actually feel yourself down by the ocean, breathing in the sea air. However, as for plot and character development, it was so hard to tell because the book moved so darn slow. I kept picking it up and putting the book down over and over. To be honest, you get so frustrated after a while that you really stop caring. But nonetheless, I did finish the book, but it would be hard to recommend."
3,"Amagansette, the book",If you grew up on Long Island you will enjoy this book. There is alot of history in it about the East End of Long Island along with a good mystery.
4,Moody Mystery,"Mark Mills' Amagansett features coastal long island as the setting in the post World War II era with a mixture of rich and poor characters that clash after a dead woman is pulled up in a fishing net. Conrad, the lead of the story, is a brooding veteran who serves as a powerful protagonist. The writing is fantastic, the mystery interesting, and this book is worth your time and money."
3,Atmospheric Novel,"In 1947 a young, rich woman is found in a fisherman's net. Her death is first considered accidental however, Tom Hollis a dective investigates further. Dectective Hollis and the fisherman Conrad who found the body are the maine charcters in the novel. The story is able convey what the eastern part of Long Island was like over 50 years ageo. Conrad is a sympathtic character and the story moves unfolds most of the time with a good pace. I liked it .B+ for crime genre."
4,Interesting,"I really enjoyed this book. It started a little slow for me and I had a little trouble keeping up with the characters, but then everything really started to click!The setting was not one that I'm familiar with-the New York area in the 40s and this made it even more interesting.The plot is not very complex in this story and most will figure out the guilty parties fairly quickly, but this did little to keep me from turning pages. Great story!"
4,A great read,The book gives you a sense of history about the people and way of life about this area while keeping you completely caught upin the mystery around the death of the young woman. Couldn't put it down and was sorry to see it end.
2,Definately try before you buy- Another dissenter,"I was really disappointed in this but I didn't realize why until I read the review that pointed out the music shift when they recut it for TV. I own the Music CD from the series (also available on Amazon), and when I compared the music on the movie- sure enough- that is definately the missing element. If you are interested in the CD, search ""popular music"" for the title: ""The Adventures of Superman: Original Television Soundtrack (1950s TV Series)""I strongly suggest anyone wanting this to first take a look at a copy from a video rental house.I much prefer Phyllis Coates as Lois. She was ok in this, a little snippy and bitchy, but my opinion is that the more classic scenes of her were in the tv episodes, not this movie."
1,"DON""T BUY IT!!!!!","This is NOT the i-Pod wire for the Alpine CDA-105. Do not buy it!!! Its the 440i you need. I wish I knew, but who reads reviews for a Wire!!! Amazon obviously does not read reviews, or I wouldn't be stuck like others."
1,ipod touch,It does not charge the ipod touch!!! It would've been nice if the description said charges ipods except ipod touch.very disappointing.
1,"If it isn't genuine Alpine, don't expect it to work like Alpine.",Ordered the Alpine cable that was advertised and got some crappy knockoff that doesn't work as expected. So no I am not happy and no this is not a ding against Alpine.
1,COUNTERFEIT!,"I purchased an Alpine 9886 Head unit, which already comes with a REAL Alpine KCE-422I cable, although I was led to believe by the good people at Amazon that it did not, so I followed their lead in the optional accessories line to this product, which unfortunatly I bought. I recieved the car stereo and Discount Jungle's cable the same day. I noticed the difference in the two cables immediatly. The Knock-offs connections are looser and the cable is stiff and unflexible. On the other hand, the REAL 422i has tight and smooth connections, with nice limber cable.Make no mistake.THIS IS NOT AN ALPINE PRODUCT! Nowhere is the word Alpine to be found on the shipping envelope, and since the cable is just wound up and thrown in the the bag without any store-type pakaging(like the one I saw at Best Buy,which is also a Real Alpine Cable) The only place that says this is an Alpine product is on Amazon's site. I will Never buy from Discunt Jungle again!"
1,Unpleaseant Surprise!,"Wow, I can't blv I'm saying this. I'm very dissapointed with Alpine. I dished out the money to buy this cable to use on my new Alpine 9887. I planned to hide my Ipod in my glove compartment and just use the remote and head-unit to operate it.However, I noticed that when I park my car my ipod remains powered on, which is very problematic, because it means the battery will end up being drained.I hope Alpine recalls these cables and released a new improved version. I'm going to keep my cable but next time I'll think twice before buying another alpine product and so should you."
1,Do NOT buy if your HU has USB out!,"I purchased this cable to use with my CDA-105 HU, as was recommended by Amazon. The plug on this cable was similar, but not compatible with the one on the HU. The CDA-105 has the Ai-Net plug, and a USB plug on the back. After I found that this cable would not plug into the connector on my HU I took both to a local stereo shop and was told to just use a USB cable like the one that comes with your iPod. I inquired if I could also use a USB extension so that I wouldn't have to buy another iPod USB cable, and was told that they had previously tried this in an installation and it would not work. I ended up buying another iPod USB cable from WalMart for $18.95. I wish I had known that I needed this beforehand so I could have ordered the cable from Amazon, since they have it for around $1.00 + shipping. Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/Dock-Connector-Cable-iPhone-White/dp/B0007RV3IE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1260762778&sr=8-1"
1,not happy with it,"This cord doesn't fit into the radio well, so sound only comes out of half the speakers and a clicking noise comes out of the other half."
4,As advertised!,"Was very easy to install. Plugged into the back of my existing head unit, routed under my center console & started listening to & controlling my iPhone jams through the stereo."
1,Fake Ad,This Item is a Fake Ad you will not get a Odyssey FZ19CDJW Flight Zone Dj Coffin With Wheels For A 19 Mixer And Two Large Format Cd Players for a $104.99 it will be something else. don't wast your time
1,Blood Sausage,We received the Sausage it was warm and very displeased with the quality of meat. Over priced this is just my opinion.
3,bellezas latinas,las modelos son de muy buena categoria y muy bellas sobre todolas modelos morenas tambien las fotos son de muy buena calidadtodo el video esta bueno exepto donde salen con ropa por queeran las mejores tomas que se realizaban pero nose veian bien
2,This left me S-H-A-K-E-N,"I received this for Christmas this year. The presentation is super cute, but the fragrances is --- well--- lackluster. It didn't fizz too much and I didn't care of this pineish scent at all. I gave it two stars since I did like the the gift tin it arrived in and the overall design, but I'll stick to my favorite Haute Tub bath bombs on my next purchase."
4,Superb thriller!,I saw this movie on television in the beginning of the 80's. I thought it was great fun then and when I bought the video last year I found it to be even better. Warren Beatty does a great job and so does the other actors. Quincy Jones great score adds to the suspense. My favorite scene is the chase on the ice. A wonderful movie that deserves more attention and respect.
3,Early 70s Heist-Chase,"Dollars is a bank heist-car chase movie from the early 1970s. Shot with a low-ball urban shoe-string look and sensibility. It contains the motifs of this genre that keeps it's core audience satiated. Fast cars, daring heist, 'good guys' & bad guys with little or no morals, loose women, shady dealings, where no-body relevant to the story gives a f***. Quincy Jones (The Getaway) supplies the soundtrack, great fun, also available, somewhere. Goldie Hawn looks delicious, post-war Hamburg looks bleak, Warren Beatty is effective and not showing off in his role. The car-chase is really good, maybe the first on snow and ice & well done."
2,A bank robbery gone melodramtic,"Although a must for Goldie fans, this 1973 film does little to arouse the senses. Even this well-planned bank robbery is much too light-headed to offset the serious acting talent of Gert Frobe (of Goldfinger fame).More power to Goldie for the leg up this flick provided. Otherwise, there is little else to say, except that if not a Goldie fan, the film can be avoided."
3,Some Value,"A rare throw-away role for Beatty in this 70s caper that's never dull but is certainly too long. The methodical build-up to the bank heist seems to go on forever and you may lose patience by the time you get to some good action stuff towards the end. Good location settings and Warren's cool here, but it's hard to believe Goldie Hawn's shtick ever found favor with audiences. She's an idiot, childlike prostitute who's supossed to be adorable? The fact that the actress is a deft player makes it all the more depressing.And am I missing something? Entertainment Weekly dubbed this a box office dud, but I seem to remember it having been fairly popular when I was a kid -- it was certainly a big deal when it debuted on TV."
5,women from the Honer series,"These women are in the honor series, the last few books of the series. I don't know if anyone has picked up on this or not but I wanted to let every body know and to say that I think it ranks up there with al her other books that it was a great book."
5,Sweet wonderful romance,Just what I wanted - 2 excellent characters - very believeable and heart wrenching. Wonderful scenery around the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Excellent slice of life. Loved it! Very mature story line - if you are a grownup who likes a solid read and a good romance this is for you. I started by loving Adrienne and then cheering for Tanner.Look for the newest edition published by Bold Strokes Books October 2004.This is a Keeper !
5,Loved this Book,"From the moment I picked uo this book I could not put it down,another great book by Radclyffe!"
3,Good for Vegetable Seed Saving,"First published in 1975. Reprinted in 1978. A 46-page pamphlet written for UK gardeners wishing to save their own vegetable seeds. Nothing here about fruit or flower or grass seeds. Astonishing to read that many seed varieties were banned from sale by UK and EU governments, which was a strong motivation for the author writing this pamphlet. More modern and comprehensive seed saving books are available. This is a short and interesting read if you can find a good used copy for a low price. Not worth the outrageous prices being offered by some Amazon.Com vendors."
2,Not Worth Your Money - Buy CD's Instead!,"I saw this when I was shopping at Tower Records and it was 15 bucks so I am a fan of the offspring so i bought it. I am very dissapointed. I mostly bought it for the live concert video footage, but it seemed so fake. I think the video is real concert footage, but the music is studio! What a ripoff. Also, its stupid to buy it just for the music videos cuz you can find that online for free!"
3,"Five stars in presentation, but flawed.","First of all, I want to say the OffSpring is among my favorite bands. I have all of their disk, even the original self titled one before they cut the track they want forgotten.This disk is exactly what it said it was, all of their videos as of the time of the disk release.I have two problems with it.First - the Original Prankster video is slightly censored. I have seen the uncensored version before, knowing an uncensored version exist I felt disappointed having the DVD censored. -1 star.Second - this is the really big one - the disk is very heavily interlaced. The video playback looks great on my 36"" CRT, but anything else the interlacing is so bad it can't be ignored. -1 starIf they were to re-release this with those two items fixed it would easily be five star."
1,Didn't do a thing for me,"The DVD was fine, but it didn't do anything to help make exercise more ""fun."" A lot of the moves were ok when taken slowly but at regular pace.. it was dreadful."
2,Difficult unless you have years of experience and no hip hop music in it,"I bought this after I had my daughter, since I did not have time to go to the gym. I thought I could tone up and learn some fun dance moves. The first thing I will say is this is very fast paced, even the teaching section is fast paced. In my opinion many of the dance moves are very complex, at least for a person that only has one year of dance experience in hip hop and jazz. Another thing I did not like about this video is that the music is very bland and repetitive, like something you would hear in an old school 70's work out video, it is not modern and fun to dance too. If you are looking to a fun work out video, with music that makes you want to work out, and easy moves to learn, this is NOT the video for you and if you have no dance experience this also is NOT the video for you."
3,Difficult,"I have never before done a hip-hop work out video and I found it pretty difficult. I have done aerobics classes, Wii workouts, Wii dance, etc. It is very quick paced and when she puts all the moves together, its difficult to keep up and follow, never having done those moves before. There is a training session before the actual workout to show you how to do the moves, but I think it will just take doing the video many times to learn the moves. It is a good workout, you definately sweat. I gave it three stars for workout and fun factor! You wont get bored doing this routine."
4,Pretty hard dance steps,It's a pretty hard dance steps really need to catch the step guide. It's was pretty fun workout! Jennifer is a great instructor.
4,Another challenging but fun DVD from Jennifer,"I say this in all my reviews... I LOVE Jennifer Galardi. She delivers again with this fun but definitely challenging workout.I really like that DOTI includes a step guide, giving you a chance to get the more intricate moves down before you workout. This really allows you to focus on your cardio instead of your footwork. But of course, instruction from Jennifer is always fabulous, and she breaks down moves for you without ever sacrificing your cardio, which is why I love working out with her.Really fun routines, can't wait to try Jenn's other Dance of the Inches DVD."
2,A little disapointing,"the first 50 pages are good and explore interesting philosophical concepts, based upon Robert Ringer's life. The rest of the book is frankly mediocre. We do live in a different world indeed, and its seems that the ""turtoise"" has a hard time dealing with it."
1,The Antidote to Action,"This tome should inspire. Unfortunately, it serves as a sedative. It has been years since I last tossed a book only partially read. With ""Action,"" I concluded that time is better spent acting on something else, like a nap."
4,Motivation at its best,"I have been waiting for Robert Ringer's new book for a while. For years ""Million Dollar Habits"" has been my source of inspiration. I've reread it many times and it never fails to provide new insights.Ringer's wisdom shines through in this new book too. It is a call to action which many people need in this day and age. But it also contains a lot of gems of wisdom which really make you think. Ringer's style is straight to the point, but you got to have the Reality Habit and learn to face the truth.This book is a valuable guide to life."
5,"My view of Robert Ringer's book, ""Action""","""Robert Ringer is certainly a visionary.About 30 years ago, when I first read his""Looking Out For #1"". I started using it asmy North Star in running my life.He recently published ""Action! Nothing HappensUntil Something Moves.""Once I started reading, I could hardly put it down.I feel it to be a modern day masterpiece. It is abeautiful complement to ""Think and Grow Rich.""Packed with wisdom it is obviously the work of aspiritually awakened man.As lovely as a sunrise, as beautiful as a dewdrenched rose, it is a magnificent guide for livingduring these turbulent times. I recommend it toanyone desiring a more balanced and fulfilling future.""Burt Dubin, President, Personal Achievement Institutewww.speaking success.com_____________________________________________________"
5,Truthful concepts never die,"I've followed Robert Ringer's ""real life"" principles since 1978. Because I believe in and have applied his success strategies, I've survived bankruptcy and now own a successful financial planning business. Without his brutal honesty and a willingness to examine what was really taking place in my life, there is no doubt in my mind that I would not be where I am today. ""Action"" simply embodies the truths that he has espoused over the years and gives specific advice on how to implement them. I have purchased several copies and sent them as gifts to friends that need a jump start. Terrific book and life changing - if you have the guts![...]"
2,"Wrong mirror glass type, vibrates badly when driving.","This mirror would be perfect except for two things:1. The mirror glass vibrates so badly while driving that you cannot even see what is in the mirror2. The mirror glass is of the wrong type. The glass in this mirror is the kind that should be used on the passenger side (Object in mirror are close than they appear).The folding mechanism is superior to that of the Chrysler mirror, however this is out-shadowed by the issues noted above. Now I need to go spend $224 for the real deal.Paul"
1,I Think It Is A Difficult And Stupid Game...But...,"But my neighbors little one likes to play it. That is what is was purchased for. So, I guess I will keep it."
4,Walk like you've seen it before,"This whole DVD thing needs to stop. We understand that you have a creative side and you want to show what else you can other than spit hot fire on the mic, but sadly this is....sad. The DVD movie that intertwines with the cd is corny and wack and no one really needs to see it. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it contains the first cd, and it tight, and the bouns disc which has my boy Brother Ali (although amazon has shock G but whatever) is pretty sick too. So bottom line, if u got the 9th edition there is no need to cop this unless u want Murs to get some extra skrill."
3,Good,"This album /movie had a good storyline and some good songs; although i think it didnt hit the same mark as other murs albums, i still enjoyed it."
3,Biased Author,"Actually enjoyed the book but when the author delves into the main character's arrest of illegal activities which make up about 1/3 of the book, she looses all credibility. You have to read in between the lines to know that her husband was one of his lawyers. She cites her husband as a source and tries to leads the readers to believe that maybe this character was deceived. On a straightforward basis, the book is a good study of some unbelievable situations in the Deep South and the lack of character by both white and black political leaders."
4,A model of clarity,You don't need to be a Lutheran to benefit greatly from this book. Klemet Preus has a gift as a theological communicator. I found myself arguing with him at points but he exposed more than one weak spot in my thinking. I must have talked to my wife about it quite a bit as she kept pushing me to finish so she could read it! And she is glad she did. Highly recommended.
5,Lutheran doctrine,"This book is a good summary of Lutheran doctrine. It is very readable, easy to understand and can be enjoyed by pastors and/or layman alike. It especially addresses how some current contemporary worship and also church growth practices can directly affect the doctrine of a church."
1,Even a Hobbit Wouldn't Read This.,"This book shouldn't be called a novel, which implies some form of original story line that actually entertains the reader. Chudwin falls into predictable and overused plot lines that bore rather than excite or interest. Many of the reviews given on this page seem simple in themselves and must be the writer's high school friends to have been so kind as to call it magical. Don't waste the $20 bucks and shipping."
5,Only got 1 pack (of the 6 total) (Update),"Will update the review when I get the rest of my order. I have used hearos before and loved the blue ones since they are great at blocking out sound. However, getting a missing order is going to be a hassle since I need these asap.Contacted customer support and they got back to me within a minute..wow I am very impressed. Amazon has offered to send a replacement order at no extra charge within the next few days. Keep shopping amazon!"
2,Don't buy!!,"they are too squishy to stay in my ear, and within a minute they pop right back out! While they are in they don't really block out much noise."
5,Very Good product!,"I've been using those for a week now, and they are very good. I use them alongside some headphone and I can't even hear what's happening in the outside world! Great for productivity...until there's a zombie attack of course hehe."
4,Good CD for blugrass beginners,"This CD provides any new listener to bluegrass a good starting point. The songs are enjoyable and simple, especially Bela Fleck's contribution and the new version of ""Blackjack Davy."" I would have liked to seen more of the instrumentals of driving bluegrass, and this is the main item that kept it from getting 5 stars. If you are looking for a first jaunt into bluegrass, this is a safe bet."
3,Normal Bluegrass,Nothing special but still worth buying. This cd is just another bluegrass cd to add to your collection.
5,A Pleasant Surprise - A Woman's Book - To Be Sure !,"Beautiful and Enjoyable, a book that could uplift my spirit in the worst of times. Truly a woman's book all about heroin's from past, forward. Never boring, always a new story that fills the reader with inspiration. I picked up the book in a used store, and have not put it down since. Ms. Williams has created the most genuine character's and if you like the ""Jean Auel"" style, you will enjoy ""The Cave Dreamers"". She has a wonderfully comfortable writing style that is truly entertaining and not like studying a work book. Good reading. In the beginning it says that; ""it is for every woman that has loved a daughter or has needed a mother""...Beyond truth. Every woman that loves to read should read this fasinating book and ""Share the Secret""!Tired of the same old read? Find The Cave Dreamer's.... you will be hansomely rewarded."
1,wrong item,item recieved was not the picture on website.. item ordered was no available so the sent a comparable item without contacting me first. returned item
4,"Drugged Athletes,The Crisis in American Sports","The book entitled Drugged Athletes, the Crisis in American Sports, is an excelent read. It has many interesting, intreguing, and sometimes sad parts to it. First off, the drugs most athletes used. Most used Anabolic Steroids to up their strength. Some others used cocaine and marijuana to ease the pain of modern sports injuries, mostly life or carreer threatening injuries. The drugs do eventually ware off, but while they are in affect, they do cause many troubles in the sports they're in. They do cause more bad than good, in most cases. In a select few, nothing happens but the best, like the abuser becoming better at most all catagories for athletic play. They become faster, stronger, and sometimes, even smarter. This is an excellent book to read. I rate this 4 stars."
4,good quality,"good quality for the ""sale"" price. the claps is very sturdy. I added a ""safety chain"" and now i am sure to wear this bracelet for years to come."
4,Charm bracelet,This bracelet has a nice clasp; says the jeweler. It came faster than I anticipated and it is having 13 charms soldered on it right now. I can hardly wait to wear it.
2,bulky looking,"too big and bulky...made well, but the extra large links make it look cheap and are too big for most charms. the bracelet overpowers the charms because it's so big."
1,Looks like junk,"Let me give you a hint, I found this same one on the side walk, looking for the owner I looked it up, this thing has a broken clasp and the ""shiny silver"" people are talking about now looks like a vending machine bracelet. I was surprised to see this thing cost as much as it did because it looks like it came from the dollar store, so if you want a bracelet that you will end up loosing because the clasp breaks, and looks like trash, pick this one."
4,Convenience and ease of handling all in one.,The Xircom Electronics REXDS Rex Docking Station by Xircom Electronics enables efficient and ease of scheduling all possible in one easy action. The smooth sliding action into the docking station by Xircom enables every single featured event or item in your companion or PC to be updated or entered into each other in a matter of time (or in my case seconds). It is rapid and totally suits my demanding lifestyle. The Xircom Electronics REXDS Rex Docking Station by Xircom Electronics is a must for every Xircom Rex!
5,The life of man totally committed to the will of God,"This is my absolute favorite book of all time. In an age when I struggle to find like-minded people around me, Jim Elliot encourages and inspires my heart. In an introduction recently added to the book, Elisabeth Elliot says it all. She describes how HUNDREDS of young men over the years have come up to her at conferences or book signings and told her ""that book changed my life."" God answered Jim Elliot's prayer that he would be ""A testament to the value of knowing God."" It's so amazing to me to think how God could use this one man to reach so many people. Great book. If you are a young guy like me and wanting to live earnestly for Christ, you've got to read this book."
5,As Real as it Gets.,"Some books entertain, this book inspires change. The writing is intelligent, and thoughtful. The topic is incredible. This is the modern Christian life as real as it gets."
4,Shadow of the Almighty,"Again, this is another of Elisabeth's books. This one though is a biography of her husband, Jim Elliot and it portrays with love and honesty her husband's heart. Recommended reading for anyone interested in the life of a missionary."
5,This book was inspirational,"Ellisabeth Elliot does her husband honour, thy way it is written and what is written has encouraged me so much, to have a heart after God is the most important issue in our lives."
3,Deep!,It was hard for me to imagine someone who actually talked and wrote like that. It is made up mostly of his diary and letters. But he was definitely a selfless Christian.
3,"Knowledgeable, but...","""Battle of Monroe's Crossroads and the Civil War's Final Campaign"" is the work of an author who had done a great deal of indepth research. Unfortunately, he needs a new publisher. The book has a suprising number of typos and, in one place, has a whole paragraph that definitely seems out of place. The maps are detailed to the point that they are difficult to read. (We don't need to see every stream in a black/white map.) Overall, the book has a lot of good sections but seemed somewhat disjointed to me. However, I would still recommend it for info on a battle that is typically overlooked."
5,"Steamy,Latin, and Rockin'","I'd bet you've never heard salsa like this! Truly imaginative,unique, and passionate. Salsa, rock, maybe even surf rock influenced. Really hot, and very danceable. Picture a latin rave somewhere in LA and these guys would be the house band. If you have any interest in where salsa and the latest rock influences merge, you will love this CD!"
4,foxy lod womans guide to traveling alone,great little book I wanted my 20 y/o daughter to read...I've given her 4 of them!
4,Muscle Addiction,"Muscle is a book that explores the addiction to climb a ladder that is leaning against the wrong wall. The books takes many unexpected twist and turns, but is always well written and exciting. One man's experience that represents a growing nation looking for security by building ""Muscle""."
4,Thoughtful and provoking,"Kudos to Mr Fussel for sharing his tragic yet comical story. This book takes the reader into the seedier side of bodybuilding as well as the intellectual side of the culture that reads more than just the labels of protein powders and supplements. I'm a little suspicious of his ""the names of some individuals have been changed to protect the innocent"" and how outlandishly cartoonish some of the characters are I applaud his honesty and his ability to point the finger at himself.The ending could be a little more detailed and less rushed, but all in all this is a very good book for those in and outside of the world of bodybuilding."
4,Understand where the author is coming from,"This biography of Sam Fussell's experimentation (serious experimentation) with bodybuilding is a truly great read. I highly recommend it. However, you have to understand the perspective from which the book is written. Fussell writes this after having quit bodybuilding, as an effort to reestablish himself among the intelligentsia who fear/despise bodybuilding. Fussell's tone is thus appropriately apologetic and confessional, and he describes bodybuilding as ""the disease."" Remarkably, he has nothing good to say about the lifestyle that consumed him for several years. The child of literary parents, this is Fussell's literary mea culpa for straying from the fold. It is not, therefore, an even-handed description of bodybuilding. I think it does contain a lot of good material, and makes some great points, but its perspective should be understood up front."
4,Welcome to the real world....,"I give this book a 4 star rating simply because it takes a man of Mr. Fussell's stature in the ""World of Bodybuilding"" to make you realize how prevalent drug use is in the entertainment industry.If it wasn't for the ""no-holds-barred"" aspect of this book, it would be a contender for a lower rating for sure. I really dislike the fashion in which he tells his story. He gets to California, and though shown kindness by folks he just met, and though he starts using steroids within his first two days there.... He bags on 'em like he was somehow above it all."
4,One mans' insights on the lifestyles and training involved.,"I found this book to be both insightful and frustrating. Throughout the book, Mr. Fussell seems to be his best biographerand worst enemy - on the one hand, his insights on the training andphilosophy are keen, but he almost seems to miss the point of it in bemoaninghis new look and way of life. (I was always wondering, ""If it causes that much angst,WHY DO IT?!?"")."
3,Articulate look at competitive bodybuilding rings true!,"An articulate, often funny look at the fanatical world of competitive bodybuilding. This account rings true. Anyone who is familiar with the bodybuilding world will instantly recognize the fanatical, driven, bizarre cast of gym rats in this book. Mostly young men who devote every waking moment and thought to packing muscle onto their bodies. They are willing to do whatever it takes to win. Steroid abuse is the norm. There are many bodybuilders who work out for the health benefits, would never take steriods, and keep their workouts in perspective. They are not represented in this book. Disillusioned, Fussell stops working out at the end of the book and never deals with the sane, common sense approach to weight training. But common sense and sanity do not sell many books and the fact that these men are steroid-driven fanatics is a large part of what makes this account so interesting. This book offers an accurate look into that world."
3,Pulp Fiction,"The author writes in a juvenile but easy-reading style, and it all comes off as incredibly shallow, but still generally interesting. Like a made-for-TV movie you can't help but watch.I didn't believe any of it, though. All the characters felt like cartoon archetypes, and many of the stories told in the book seemed incredibly implausible. So much of the story came down to mean-spirited, shallow descriptions of people who never feel like anything more than walking cliches. There were several consecutive pages given to mocking the valley girl accent, and joke after joke of how flighty people in LA were. The repeated insults of homosexuals and people with hairlips (no, really - I think it was coded language for people of weak genetic stock) really grated.That said, the end of the book, detailing his final three contests and their preparations, was a fairly interesting look at something I was almost totally unfamiliar with."
5,A Personal Testimony,"Ordinary people can be transformed into bodybuilders, as the author of this book can personally attest. There's also a look at what goes on behind the scenes in the bodybuilding world."
2,"Nice idea, low quality.","It looks nice and works okay, but the quality is less than expected. The pen/stylus combo was obviously a pen/pencil in a previous life -- there's a pencil eraser under the top cap, and if you push the cap (in stylus mode) the stylus pokes way out and you have to push it back in. It's obvious that they just replaced the lead-advance mechanism with a stylus tip. Summary: Convenient and attractive, but disappointingly cheap."
3,Good idea but people make mistakes,Its a good idea and all but I have used the ballpoint pen instead of the stylus 1 too many times. Its just easier to buy a pen!
5,DoctorMoon is an Idiot,"DoctorMoon, the reason you can only get eight characters is probably because you are trying to use this with DOS or Windows 98 (Same Difference) or because you do not actually own one.If you use this on a Mac or Win 2000 (not tested XP), you can load it with as many characters as your OS and the application will allow.The Jump Drive is just about the coolest gadget you can get your high school or college child these days, except maybe an iPod, iPodMini, Archos AV320, or a PocketPC 2215."
3,Re: Filename length (Doctormoon),"Actually, I've experienced a similar problem with the Jumpdrive (see DoctorMoon's review). I use OS X, and I get an error message when trying to copy files with certain special characters in them. From what I can tell, the Jumpdrive specifically has problems with slashes ""/"" or ""\"" as used when naming files with dates, or in certain Microsoft Entourage script files. I solved the problem by changing all the slashes to periods, or just not including those particular files on the Jumpdrive.Besides which, it's not very nice of you all to go around calling someone an idiot when they have a legitimate problem!"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Before thinking about this product, please understand the following shortcoming: It does NOT allow file names longer than 8 characters (like DOS standard). If you attempt to store a file on it with a name longer than 8 characters, a popup window gives you the option to truncate the name or simply abort the task.I contacted Lexar customer service and they confirmed this design problem and said there is nothing I could do about it.For me, this makes the Lexar 1GB 2.0 USB Jumpdrive unusable. In contrast, my SanDisk 128MB allows all of my Windows lengthy file names without any trouble.Buyer beware!!!"
3,"Cute, not the best quality","Received these as a gift off my wish list...I do love the style of these earrings, but the quality is a little lacking, which is to be expected for this price. The backing on one of the earrings is a bit loose so it has me worried that I might lose one earring. Other than a slightly loose clasp, very cute earrings and overall I'm pleased."
1,disappointed,These earrings began to get a white haze on them shortly after I received them. I keep them in the same jewelry box as my other silver jewelry so it can't be because of storage.
1,Poor Quality,"Let me preface this by saying that I've had two pairs of silver hoop earrings that each lasted more than a decade before I lost them.This pair did not last more than two months before one of the posts broke off at the base of the hoop (poor solder joint.) I never slept with them on or wore them while running, exercising or dancing so it was not from any misuse or abnormal wear.Besides the weak link, I also did not like the look. I couldn't tell from the picture that the hoops are flat, not tubes. From the side they look great but from the front they are not very noticable because they are very, very thin."
1,disappointed,"Review of 22mm hoops - one earring broke the second time I wore them, very disappointing. The straight bar that goes through the ear simply snapped off from the hoop. The purchase was made via a gift card from my daughter for a Mother's Day gift.This makes the entire scene worse.Thanks for the opportunity to speak about this.I would appreciate a replacement, free of any and all charges."
5,Exactly as pictured!,"Just received these and they are exactly as pictured. They are solid but not too heavy to weigh down earlobe. Very shiny and classic looking. They do NOT look cheap as some of the reviewers claimed. These are perfect for work, not large and I don't have to worry about losing an earring with this style. I have multiple holes and with small diamond studs these look awesome!"
5,Great!!!!,These earrings are more than I expected. I love to wear them every chance I get. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a great pair of sterling silver hoops.
2,Looks cheap!,They look really nice on the computer but they super cheap. They are thin and look like they are from Claire's. I bought them as a Christmas gift. I apologized to my friend that they look & feel so cheap. Not bad for the price but I wouldn't recommend them as a gift unless it to a little girl.
3,Hoop earrings,"Good finish. After I received them i realized that they would probably look better in a smaller size, for my taste."
4,Great bag,I got this bag because my slumberjack cot was probably the best made cot Ive ever owned and because it was wider then a mummy bag. It looks and feels very solid and For the most part i was very warm considering it was about 20 deg outside and windy.The carrier bag is a bit to small and very hard to get the sleeping bag into. So i may buy a bigger carrier bag soon But over all i am very pleased with this bag and still stand by all slumberjack products.
5,Amazing Performance.....,"To begin with I am a devoted Beach Boys fan who did not like Pet Sounds when it first arrived back in '66. Maybe because I was only fourteen at the time and I missed their surf and car music. As I grew older this album became my all time favorite. I did see this tour back in 2000 and it was marvelous. I know Brians vocals are not what they use to be, but again his presence on stage is a miracle in itself. The Wondermints are amazing.This performance is awesome and a must for every Beach Boy fan."
3,great for hardcore fans,"This DVD is a live (patchwork) reproduction of Brian Wilson and his band performing the classic Pet Sounds album. Just the album tracks. It is not from his symphonic Pet Sounds tour. It does not contain any of the other songs from the shows it's been culled from (this DVD is about 1/2 a Brian Wilson concert). It does not contain the symphonic overture performed at many of the last Pet Sounds shows. This DVD would be great gift for any hard-core Brian Wilson fan, because they are probably not buying it for themselves due to the above shortcomings."
2,Laughable at best,"Call me over-critical, but this DVD and concert tour is possibly the worst career move i've seen Brian Wilson make for a long time. Shot in London's Royal Albert Hall, It features Brian Wilson accompanied by a large backing band playing a note for note rendition of Pet Sounds. To the band's credit, they faithfully transfer the impossible task of the album's harmonies and instrumental nuances to a live setting. I must say the Wondermints and crew do an amazing job vocally. The big problem lies with Wilson himself: HE CAN'T SING ANYMORE. Gone is his chilling falsetto of the 60s, replaced with some haggard elderly man trying to save face. Maybe a DVD with the full backing orchestra would have been more appropriate, as they could hide his own voice. The orchestra would also help in some of the band's more hollow moments, such as the opener ""Wouldnt It Be Nice"" and ""God Only Knows"" I can't see how the DVD would appeal to Wilson's hardcore fans, as this performance is just pitiful."
1,Horribly produced concert video,"This DVD is absolutely unwatchable because of the way it is edited. There are cuts from shot to shot just about every 3-5 seconds and it will make you dizzy to watch it. To me, the director/editing of this thing completely ruined Brian Wilson's performance. Any director/producer/editor of concert videos needs to study The Last Waltz to see how it's done. Fewer cuts, fewer close ups, etc. Too bad this performance is ruined by a bad video document such as this DVD."
4,Good Value,"Very good material, but a little too brief. This material deserves at LEAST 60-90 minutes of attention, not a mere 35 in this video. Lacked simulations and dynamic demonstrations -- i.e. reenactments. Overall good material and great value."
3,I was shopping for 3D DVD's when this came up in my browser,"I thought I ordered a DVD in 3D on the Galapagos Islands. It was a book, much to my chagrin. It's still an interesting concept for a book, and I will give it to my grandson when I see him."
5,Excellent,"Bought this book for an essay I had to write in school. For anyone who has read Zizek before - this book is classic Zizek. Love it or hate it, his style is provocative and incredibly insightful. As he admits in the first few pages, this book is not exactly about Iraq. Rather, it is about everything that happened around Iraq. Expect a lot of psychoanalysis, Hegelese, and and Zizek's jokes from the Soviet era."
2,Well meaning but not tasty,"There are very good things to say about these licorice bears: the ingredients are all organic, there are no animal ingredients like gelatin, and no wheat gluten. And each 3.5oz box contains four smaller pouches, making it easier to give kids small treats.Unfortunately, there's also a huge downside: they're not tasty. While there's no arguing over taste, I've tried lots and lots of licorice candies, and these rank way at the bottom. The main problem is actually the texture: they're very gritty. Unlike chewier licorice, these are like a gummy bear without the 'bounce', and with a granular texture added.I recommend trying Gustav's brand licorice instead. Drops if you like soft, and Cats or Coins if you like chewier."
4,"A bit of good, a bit of bad","I recommend this cd, but with several reservations. Scriabin's music is great and Ogden's skill as a pianist is evident. In addition, one gets two cds for the price of one, including all ten sonatas and a few other assorted pieces, intelligently placed between the sonatas based on chronological order. Now the bad news. The bass on the recording is not all that clear and the overall sound is just not that distictive. While Odgen effectively carries the music to the brink of collapse, then restores order, much of the time his playing really doesn't distinguish itself. You can't do better for the price, but you can probably find several better recorded, better performed sets of Scriabin's sonatas."
4,Ladybug bracelet,This is a very sturdy and affordable little bracelet. Wear it all the time next to my watch and it looks great. Have seen similar bracelets in 14K gold for hundreds of dollars. This is a GREAT choice for the value
5,A great favorite,The Jerusalem polymath and teacher of Torah Yaakov Fogelman considers this to be the finest piece of Jewish fiction he has ever read.
4,Small but effective,"This bag looks great. I wanted one that didn't look like a camera bag and this one does just that. The padded area is kind of small, just slightly larger than one like you might find at wal-mart. it does have extra storage in the top part which is helpful. If you are looking for one that you can carry a body and a couple of smaller lenses in this one is great. In the bottom most part (where the padding is) I have a body, a 17-40 super wide angle lens, a 70-300 telephoto, an 18-55, and a 50mm lens. In the top I keep all of my filters, a couple batteries, chargers, cables, atomizer, and flash unit, cleaning stuff, and few other little things. -that sounds like a lot, it's really pretty crammed..."
2,Has potential,"I've only played it once with 4 people, so maybe we didn't understand fully. Nonetheless it feels somewhat similar to Power Grid, without being half as fun. We found it rather annoying that the board wasn't translated, which made it much harder to learn the already complex game. I think the real problem with the game is that it's all about scoring points (as a consequence of building factories at the right time and in a few other ways), the only interaction you have with other players is through the auctioning system which I didn't really like at all."
3,Doesn't include Australia/NZ,"I use this adapter all the time for trips to Europe, and its been fine. I like how it cleverly snaps together and stores neatly.I was disappointed when I arrived in Australia today, took it apart and realized I didn't have a match. I am not sure why I didn't check ahead of time, I just figured it had everything. Luckily, I found a tourist supply shop that sold things like camera batteries. They had an adapter, but in the meantime I lost a few hours of work time."
3,Travel Adapter,Worked as advertised - the challenge is in countries like Italy where they use 2 different outlet designs - this adapter includes the 2 pin version and leaves out the 3 pin version. Had to get another adapter while in Italy to make things work.
5,"Compact, easy to use","This is an excellent, portable converter. I keep it in my travel bag. Lightweight, compact and functional this a go-to travel converter that has worked for me in Europe, China and Brazil."
5,"Great item, works as advertised.","Purchased for International travel. I've used it in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The product works as it should. I like the minimal size and lighter weight as wel."
4,Works well in Berlin!,I purchased three of these in August for my semester abroad in Berlin. I am very pleased with them. The only complaint that I have is that one of them does not like to keep my electronics plugged in. If I even move it slightly it will unplug whatever I have plugged in. The other two do not have this issue. I believe it has something to do with the stocket that I am using in my classroom. Other than that they work great for my laptop and my camera charger! I plan on using the UK plug adapter when I go to London for a weekend in November. Happy travels!
2,This adapter is NOT grounded,It looks fine for a non grounded adapter set. I only took it out of the packaging though and didn't actually use it. The lack of grounding is not shown on the page description or on the packaging.
1,Miserable Failure,Attempted using the EUR portion of this power adapter in Germany and the result was a failure that produced arcing / snapping / smoke and damage to the US power plug. Targus does not even acknowledge this item as one of their products. Try searching for APK01 or APK01US on the Targus web site www.targus.com and you will find no result. It was a relief to find that the hotel would provide a plug adapter that worked properly. This adapter fit into the plug properly but appears to have been so poorly constructed that it was not able to function electrically.Targus World Power Travel Adapters APK01US (Black)
1,Stupid Stupid Stupid,"So... bought this for a trip to Europe. Worked fine in Germany and Austria. On my flight connection through London I found out that this does not have the plug adapter for the UK. Seriously? Like nobody flying to Europe wants to use his/her laptop in Heathrow? Now have the Kensington adapter on my wish list for Christmas (used to own it -- left it on a client site when running to the airport -- going to own it again one way or another). Planning to abandon this self-limiting ""world (but not UK) travel adapter""."
4,rare hammer film,"crescendo was the bottom half of a double bill with hammers ""taste the blood of dracula"".its one of those friday night horror movies that passes the time quite well,although not so much a horror film,more a thriller but none the worse for that.the film is on a par with hammers ""scream of fear""although not quite as good,it does hold its own and certainly holds your attention,its certainly one for the hammer collection.the print used by warners is there usual high standard and is part of the warner archive collection."
2,mikasa volleyball,"I thought it will be a good beach volleyball ,but I was wrong.After about 1 month it was all ruined.And we played just a couple times a week. I don't think it's the best beach volleyball for the money.I would never buy it again. I am very disappointed."
3,Las mujeres hacen melditos mas que benditos,"Una excelente coleccion de canciones fue mi primera impresion, basado en eso lo compre.De las canciones la mayoria son para el olvido, cantadas sin pasion y sin lustre. Una lastima ya que las artistas son excelentes pero no siento que tuvieran un compromiso total con el discoHay que reconocer algunas que salvan el disco, con pasion y haciendo las canciones suyasNina Pastori cantando Contigo... OLE!!!Pasion Vega, con un piano precioso y una voz desgarradoraEl boulevard de los suenios rotos, Lua me sorprendio, excelente versionChabela Vargas grande como siempre en la noche de bodas"
5,High comfort level,"I would surely like to obtain a complete collection of all psalms by this choir. For years I have looked, searched, for this collection which I heard as a child played every sunday in South America. A great collection, ageless and timeless something have and play in the home for upliftment and inspiration even if you are not a religous person. Endless stars ****************************"
3,Oldie But a Goodie,"Had this music been recorded digitally, it would have been beyond sublime. Alas, it still has an analog sound to it, despite the remastering. Nonetheless, it is worth the purchase (though for a better recording of the 46th Psalm, check out the Choir of Christ's Hospital recording of it)."
4,Psalms of David,This was purchased as a gift. It is a beautiful rendition by English boys choir of certain Psalms in traditional Anglican Chant.
5,Awesome Speed,"If you are thinking of buying an ultimate desktop, this is it. I finally coughed up the money and made the purchase and it is well worth it. I put this baby to work every day (Final Cut, aperture, itunes, internet, video editing, entertainment center etc etc) only to tire myself out. I usually never shut the system down (just place it on the sleep mode) and it gets going with out the sluggishnes you will find on PC's. And the best part is, it is super quiet. One thing I will recommend is get as much as memory you can. other than that I agree with most of the other reviews."
5,Buy it from the Apple Store if you want more,"I got this from the online Apple store and it has been a great buy. It may seem a little too pricey for the average computer user but actually is worth every dime. It has great software and is very reliable. It has never froze on me or given me the black screen of death, which is good and which means i never lose any crucial data.I recommend buying this from the apple online store if you want to make it suit you better. You can upgrade it up to 3 terabytes of hard drive, 16 gigabytes of ram, Intel Quad instead of Xeon and other options. These top notch options aren't necessary but it would be a good idea to get at least 2 gigs of ram and a 500 gigabyte hard drive."
4,A quiet powerhouse,My previous Mac was a Dual 2.7. A very fine machine with occasional loud fan noise and occasional power supply chirping. With my new Macpro 2.6 quad I've never heard a fan come on and no chirping. Having four hard drive bays is a plus because I edit video which requires plenty of space. Overall for most of the applications I use I percieve no increase in speed of the Dual 2.7 duo but for video applications there is an improvement. I wish I could have afforded the 8 proc. model but for now I'm very happy with my purchase.
2,Greasy,"I have used a lot of skin care products. My doctors office recommended this product. I had ran out of my Obagi so I thougtht I would try something new. It is oily, thick on the skin, doesn't go well with make up and feels heavy. My pores even look bigger. I am going back to Obagi."
4,Another Wonderful Stark Offering,"This is another fun read from Richard Stark. Only Parker could figure out a way to rob a military base, lose most of his crew in the process, have the loot highjacked in the process, and still walk away with money in his pockets."
2,Kindle edition not proofread,"Around loc 806 and going forward, the book seems to have not been proofread. Lots of OCR misreadings of words, and wrong or missing punctuation."
4,The Green Eagle Score,"Great book from the Parker series. Parker is one of the most famous Noir characters, and his cold character is exciting to read about and enjoy. He is calm, cool, and calculating, and always finds a way to get his jobs done. The book is very exciting and suspenseful, though at times you can guess what will be the twist. Great read over all."
3,Parker,Parker novels are very different. There is no hero and we identify with the bad guy. All in all wthey are pure entetainment.
3,The Green Eagle Score: A Review,"This is another of the early books in Richard Stark's Parker series. Parker decides to take a break from a vacation in Puerto Rico to join a gang that intends to rob the payroll of an Air Force base in upstate New York. (The book was written in 1967. There's no such thing as direct deposit, so the Air Force trucks in $400,000 twice a month and pays everyone in cash.)Parker designs a clever plan to steal the money, but the weak link (and in these books there is almost always a weak link) is the mistress of one of the gang members who knows the plot and confides it to her analyst. The shady analyst develops a plan of his own to let Parker's gang do the heavy lifting and then steal the money from them. Parker would not like such a development and will deal with it in his own inimitable way."
3,A new start for Parker,"This book marks a resurgence of the series. Entries like ""The Handle"" really made it seem like Parker had run out of steam, and while ""The Green Eagle Score"" isn't anything special, there is definitely a hint or two that the series still has some life to it.J.Ja"
4,Makes you sleepless,"This product took away my ability to sleep. If you have to take this product, take it before lunch as later in the day (dinner time)rendered me sleepless. Once I evaluated what my daily changes were, I stopped taking this in the night and started taking it before noon. Started sleeping again after that."
3,Import could have been better !!,"For the price listed , the only single worth listening too is the classic - Caught up in one night love affairs"
4,Simple addition to Stephen King Collection,"Marvel did a nice job creating another interpretation of the work of Stephen King. Nice pictures with a quick storyline that gives the reader more of the story. Not necessary to have read the book before to enjoy the story but helpful for better understanding. Overall, a nice piece to enjoy the Dark Tower with."
4,STR-DE525 an overall good receiver,"I've had this receiver for almost a year and its not bad. 5.1 in can only be used with a dolby digital decoder, so dont think any dvd player will connect to this. The power is nice and so are the features, but now i would for $100 more get the Str-de835 receiver, a new one with dolby digital and DTS decoding built in and 27 dsp modes, which is worth the extra ben franklin."
4,Outstanding,"I just bought this unit to replace my SA-VA10 amplified system, Since My DVD player is already digital out ready I didn't need to spend the extra cash for the digital receiver. My advice: If you already have the decoder in your DVD... GET THIS RECEIVER! Sounds great and great controls, lots of options."
3,Decent product for your buck,"I wouldn't say that this receiver is versatile or high quality, but for the amount that you pay its a bargain. If you are just an average person wanted to see your movies with better sound than your TV, this receiver will give you that. I have to say that this product just met my expectation (which I didn't expect too much)."
2,PARADISE LOST,"Once upon a time 5 lovely girls went off to celebrate one's impending nuptials in Mexico when...oops been here done this.Of course they meet a couple of hunky guys, get drunk and four of them are kidnapped, robbed and left to die in the desert. But since we know from the beginning there's something evil in the nearby abandoned resort where else would the bimbos end up?THE LAST RESORT offers little in originality and is quite poorly done. The acting is awful and the ending completely contrived.I've seen a lot better but also a lot worse."
2,Wow,"Marissa Tait is my step daughter and her mother and I watched this movie together. They had a lot of fun making it and it shows on the screen. Not the finest horror movie ever, but we enjoyed watching Marissa on screen."
1,Don't let the hottie on the cover fool you...,"This movie is absolutely horrible...and that is saying a lot coming from me!!! But the acting was atrocious and the plot was weak at best. I understand that you are not looking for a great plot and top shelf acting in a horror movie, but the majority of horror movies have passable acting and at least a basically decent storyline. Not the case here...Bottom line...Do not rent, purchase or view this movie!!! Not if all the other movies were gone and this was the last option...This warning warrants repetition...Under no circumstances should you watch this movie...not even if it is...THE LAST RESORT!!!"
1,Not Even Worth a $1 Redbox Rental,"This is about as bad as it gets, folks.There is nothing in the line of horror, suspense, or plot that is offered up in this pile of trash...it is a complete waste of celluloid.The acting, if you could call it that, makes Paris Hilton's acting look worthy of an Oscar. The dialogue is full of absurd, banal one-liners that try to be hip and funny, but they are not funny and the phrases have not been hip since about 1996. The directors and screenwriters clearly attempted to remake ""Wolf Creek"" and combine it with ""Turistas."" Their attempts to add humor into the mix falls flat.....and after watching it, one wonders why there is even a picture of a woman in a bikini on a beach gracing the cover art when the entire film takes place in the middle of a desert in Mexico."
1,The Dregs,"It really is terrible--thin plot, ridiculous circumstances--the girls are foul-mouthed and not sympathic; the villians are even worse. I love horror, but this is just TRASH. Sure sounded good before I bought it."
4,Just buy the Orange Box,"I got this a real long time ago, but if you're in the market for Half Life 2 as of 2009 and later, just get the Orange Box. You get more for your money, I don't think you get Half-Life Source. But HL Source isn't that much better than HL 1 anyway, all the did was slightly enhance the graphics and add physics."
1,Do not buy a used copy!!!,"I played Half life 2 at a friend's and liked it so I decided to buy my own copy. I made the mistake of buying a used copy. If you don't already know, in order to play HL2 you need to create a ""steam"" account with which the game's CD key is verified online. My copy, being a used one, was still registered under the original owner's account; and as a result I can't even install it! There is a CD key reset option available through the steam support site but I have not received a reply from them after submitting everything necessary for a new key. It's a fun game when it works, but buy a new copy!!!!!!!!"
5,Great bundle!,"Well, I was a big fan of the original Half Life and the expansion packs that came after its success. However, I didn't bought Half Life 2 as soon as it came out, I did play it at a friend house, it was awesome...but somehow managed to foget about it for a couple of years.Now, when I saw this bundle (with the original Half Life with the source water and stuff) and the Episode 1 expansion...I didn't even it. I just bought it. And let me tell you, playing Half Life 2 (and now Episode 1) can only be described as ... incredible. The physics engine, the great looking graphics (by today standards as well) the story, characters (I love DOG) its...just...awesome.I truly recommend buying this bundle OR any Half Life 2 bundle for that matter. Its worth it."
4,GREAT,WAS NEEDED TO HAVE HEATERS WORK INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER. THIS WILL HOPEFULLY SAVE ON HEATING EXPENCE. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE.
4,Cadet # 08732 120 Volt Thermostat,Used in series with a digital thermostat as a safety backup in a room that is unattended for several months.
5,"Good, Sturdy & Stylish bars","I bought these bars to relplace my stock bars, These fit the ticket.I wanted to ride more upright and have room for my night light.These are just Great!!!"
5,More comfortable ride for seniors,"This high rise handlebar fits onto my sport comfort bike well. I needed a more upright cycling position due to problems with my neck (damaged c5 vertebra). This permits me to look straight ahead without strain on my neck, a much more comfortable riding position. In adapting the bike I did need to install longer cables for my brakes, just a minor hassle.If your neck hurts after riding your bike and/or if your thumb and index finger start to go numb, you may have a similar condition. A raised handlebar definitely helps."
4,Good for commuting,"The first step in converting my mountain bike into a heavy duty commuter bike was to get this handlebar to replace the original straight bar so I can sit upright. It has served its purpose well for 1000 miles. Right now the bike needs its due overhaul, and I am planning on taking advantage of that for getting something more comfy, but this is not meant as a minus for this particular handle bar.... it rather has to do with my 6'+ stature. (BTW, handle bar and stem are supposed to be replaced periodically as they carry heavy stress - even if they're made of steel)."
4,A taste of Dietrich at budget price,"Most of the songs here are older recordings with poor to decent sound quality (with the exception of 'Mein Blondes Baby,' which sounds great)--but let me tell you, it matters very little. The English version of 'Lili Marlene' on here is a better performance than the English version on 'The Cosmopolitan Marlene' CD, though not as good as the magnificent German version on the same CD. Some of the songs have only novelty value but the performances of 'Symphonie,' 'Illusions,''I've been in Love Before,''Black Market' and 'Mein Blondes Baby' aren't just classic, they're immortal (nothing else can even approximate their romantic atmosphere). All in all, quite a lot of value for the five dollars you pay."
3,It's a matter of personal taste.,"If Marlene Dietrich is your cup of tea then this is her best. If not,.......... Incidentally, one of the songs is mislabeled: it should be The Boys in the Back Room, not Background."
3,Buyer Beware!,"After just two days the Pedometer broke, the other two item areso far ok. This pedometer is Junk with a capital J."
3,stinky,bad for hunting they smell real bad. They work OK just bad smell so OK if your into that - word.
4,fog eliminator,I have tried other fog eliminators. This is the best so far. Amazon is the place to shop for most anything as this purchase testifies.
2,I did not have luck with this one.,"I purchaced all 3 of the Clarity products from Amazon. Great service from Amazon. The Fog Eliminator didn't work for me. I could easily breath fog onto my glasses and motorcycle lens after I applied it. I also got the Clarity Anti-fog wipes and the liquid concentrate. The concentrate and the wipes work very well. I tried to fog up my glasses and motorcycle helmet lens and could not do it. Amazing stuff. So far it seems to last a couple days. If I clean my lenses, I need to apply some of the anti-fog, either concentrate of wipes. They both work great. First product that I have found that works on my glasses and helmet lens. I highly recommend the Anti-Fog wipes and liquid concentrate."
5,Im Luke Skywalker jedi knight and awesome POTF2 figure.,This figure is very different to the one i have 1st he has a tan vest 2nd his cloak is blue.But still this figure is out of this world to a galaxy far far away...
4,Timex perpetual calander,Great watch for the price. Day date window is large and clear. Indiglo a bonus. Very happy customer
2,Loud Ticking,"I was impressed with the sleek look and feel of the watch even though the face seems somewhat thicker than most watches. However, it makes unusually loud ticks. I have to keep it in a drawer at night to prevent me from hearing it while trying to sleep. I can even hear the watch tick if I'm wearing it in a quiet room or library. Others have also commented to me that they can hear my watch tick. Maybe I am the only one that has this problem or I'm just overly sensitive to unusually loud watch ticks."
5,Nice Watch / Great Timex,"Really happy with mine. I did pay a bit less than it goes for now, but it is an outstanding Timex. Seemingly well built, and the perpetual calendar does work. Don't know about leap year(?). No, probably does. Keeps excellent time and supposedly comes with 7 year battery. Band and clasp very nice, and the overall style is cool and consistent."
3,Soft on the feet but...,"...it hurts the front of my toes because they were being pushed against that ""barrier"" in the front. The shoe would be PERFECT without that barrier. I guess maybe it looks better this way, but the ""peep toe"" is useless if my toes have no room to move anyway. Might as well be a closed toe shoe. The footbed is soft and comfortable though, so unfortunately for me, I must return it. The design is very much flawed and it makes the shoe defective for the feet."
5,Moeller fuel filter system,"I have a 1953 John Deere crawler bulldozer and could not find the original fuel filter for it so I started looking for a spin off filter system . A friend of mine told me about this company that sells through Amazon named Red`s Gear and that they would have what I needed ,and sure enough I checked them out and they had what I needed.I could not be leave how cheap the price was! anyway the filter system came in just a few days and am back up and running thanks to Amazon and Red`s Gear. I would definitely recommend them to you!! Charlie R"
2,Very poorly laid out,Text is poorly arranged in this version. Seems to be just a poorly scanned copy.five more words required to submit this review
4,Little bulky,"it does what it needs to, other than that it is a little bulky, sticking little to far out but it works."
4,A really good read,"Pernelle Richards wants to buy a cosy little cottage, but so does Hunter Trenaine. He gets the the house, but Pernelle tells him off for changing the sweet little cottage. When the attached but smaller cottage comes up on the market, Hunter allows Pernelle to buy the little cottage. Then Hunter starts to show his attraction for Pernelle, only Pernelle has another man who is interested in her, and she gets attacted by him. Hunter comes to the rescue.I also disagree with the choices given for writer like Jessica Steele, and there is no place to put this.Susan Fox, the late great Betty Neels, Rebecca Winters and Helen Brooks"
3,e(X)tremely (P)oor (D)ialogue,"The usual Deighton staples are here - intriguing and involved plot and deep, well developed characters. The plot centers on the so called 'Hitler Minutes'. Documents uncovered in California after the war which tell of a secret meeting between Hitler and Churchill in 1940. What was discussed, what was promised and what became of the meeting are the subject of the novel. British Intelligence, the Russians and the CIA are all involved and the intricacies of the plot are sufficient to keep us guessing up to the conclusion. The only problem with the book is the dialogue between the characters. It's a big problem though as it's simplicity and banality is distracting. 'Winter', a Deighton novel I recently re-read suffers a little from the same shallow conversations; so similar in fact that I looked to see if they were written at the same time. They're seven years apart. Even good mystery writers can have recurring dry spells I guess."
4,Excellent diverse selection of minimal techno,"This is a great release by a collective of techno producers from the wonderful network of production and DJing in Berlin. It features a wide variety of styles, from slightly gritty and metallic to smooth and reflective. The sounds are incredible -- warm and inviting of a crafeful listen. Influences can be heard from both the Cologne, Ger. camp of Mike Ink, Thomas Brinkmann, and The Mondernist and fellow Berliners of the Basic Channel/Chain Reaction crew. So if you like the German minimal style, pick this one up for a listen. I have the vinyl release of it and have been using a lot of the stuff as DJ material, but I have been so impressed that I am now hunting down the CD version. A special edition of the release comes with a free extra CD featuring a DJ mix set from one of the Sender Berlin DJs, so keep your eyes open..."
2,Bad Quality...constantly failing. Go with a Brand Name,"I bought this product thinking that I was getting a good deal for the price. Now I understand why the deep discount. It's JUNK. Don't buy it.It worked well for the first 2 trips, then it started freezing up. It starts out unable to read/load discs, and when it finally does read a disc, it simply freezes the screen every 15 minutes. NOT something you want to happen on long car rides with an infant.This item should be marked down to $20. It's WORTHLESS. Next time, I buy a Sony, or another brand name. Companies that build electronics that last for years, not days."
1,Unit Failed On The 2nd Day Of Ownership,"I had this unit for exactly 2 days when it started overheating, and freezing any DVD I put in it. I'm not sure if I got a faulty one, or if they are all junk, but I still wouldn't buy it again. Needless to say, I returned it back to Amazon.The build quality is middle grade at best. If you ever dropped it, a lot of pieces would probably break off, since it is totally made of plastic.At first I thought, at this price, you couldn't expect great build quality. I was wrong. After I returned this nightmare, I bought the COBY TF-DVD7050 (available on this site). It was 30 dollars cheaper, and was extremely well built. It has metal parts, and some of it is constructed of high grade rubber. I was totally shocked. I never thought COBY was capable of building such a great unit. The Coby even has a battery, which the Dual doesn't have.Anyway, here is bottom line. Don't waste your money on this unit. Save yourself 30 bucks, and get the far superior COBY TF-DVD7050."
4,Good And Bad,"Although I like the Fuzz Octave sound this pedal makes, when I set it to the sound I want it is also extremely noisy. Even when running off a battery, it is not, for instance, quiet enough for recording, unless you are willing to have a monster hiss in the background. Of course, I like it to have maximum sub-bass fuzz, so you might find it more acceptable at milder settings. Note: I use a Boss noise suppressor, and it doesn't help here."
3,Mediocrity,"Oh boy, twenty-three performances! That's a feature? That's twenty-three songs from how many hundreds that were performed? And there isn't one untouched live song with the crowd heard, no slow motion, all the words matching the singer's mouth, etc. Filming creativity is fine, but give me a few moments completely live. And since the producers were too cheap to give us a decent insert with a correct order of performances or song names, I took out the second dvd thinking ooh, maybe some better songs on this one. Wrong. No songs on this one. A performance schedule, some photos, and other useless - but mildly interesting- filler. People want to see live music. A legend like Neil Young plays at Bonnaroo, and a concert movie trailer is more important? Weak! On two dvds there should be hours of performances for this kind of money."
2,Not a good as 2002,"I found this years DVD to be a huge let down. Some of the best performances were left out. Missing are the Funky Meters (who put on a killer show), Neil Young (I will never understand this one, the guy was a headliner!!!), moe, sound tribe, Galactic, the Wailers, Partice and few others. Last years DVD made me want to go to Bonnaroo after this years I could care less. I also really enjoyed the interviews with fans and the shots of people camping and getting their perspective on the festival, there was very little of this in this years offering. I will say that what performances they do show are well filmed and the sound is excellent. Hopefully they get a new director for next years film."
2,Dissapointing display of marketing prowess,"After the long anticipation of its release, myself and the five people I went to the festival with, all agree that 270 Miles From Graceland is a misrepresentation of the spirit and energy of the festival. Everyone I know what was there feels that the performances on the DVD do not convey the upbeat groove that dominated the performances at the festival. They also failed to represent the ammount of collaboration and experimentation between the acts and artists in attendance. It seems that the main purpose of the DVD is to target people who were interested, but did not attend, and give them a popish, hollywood style 2 hour commercial about why they should buy tickets next year. I would rather watch any of the 6 hours of video that I shot there while I was wasted out of my mind."
3,This DVD does not measure up to last years DVD!,I attended Bonnaroo this year and I believe that this DVD can not relate to what went on at this years festival! Where is Neil Young? After all he was the headliner. Where are the guest appearances such as Robert Randloph and Warren Hayes with Panic? I was so such looking forward to viewing this DVD and it has turned out to be a dud. The director does not even compare to the one last year. Hope next years DVD is better see you next year in TN.
3,Not as good as 2002,Can't quite place it... there's great music's and performances all over... but something's missing... certainly not as electrifying as the Bonnaroo 2002 DVD.I thought the sound was a little low-fi too on this DVD as compared to Bonnaroo 2002 DVD.
2,270 miles from 2004 Bonnaroo,"The setlist was not very well chosen, they should re-do the video with different picks from the show. The second reviewer who stated that the director must not have been there was spot on."
4,good stuff,"If you went to Bonnaroo or want to get an idea of the experience then you will appreciate this DVD. I was kinda disappionted that there was no Sound Tribe, Wailers, Neil Young...but overall they capture some good performances. I wish they would have had more footage of the people at Bonnaroo...for me that is what made the experience so amazing. Bonus footage is great...I loved the Jack Johnson and Mississippi All-stars jams...Also good interviews with The Dead and James Brown. This is a must buy if you went to Bonnaroo 2003."
3,Where is Keller Williams?,"How could you all leave Keller Williams out of both of your DVD's, the man is one of the most entertaining on the scene. I would have bought this if he had been on there. Hopefully you'll get it right next year....."
2,Not very impressed,"This a a VERY basic program, and I do not recommend it unless you have never played poker before. It does have the tules for many games so I have learned a couple new games, but nothing intermediate or advanced about it. Plus the box said their should be 2 cds but there was only one."
3,Its all right,The Table does look pretty with the roses and the off-white paint. but the assebly is pretty flaky. We tried to assemble it but the semicircle board at the bottom just would not fit with all the 4 legs.
3,Accent Table,"This table arrived and had to be assembled. This was not stated in the description. But assembly was fairly easy, because I didn't attempt it myself. Handed it off to the man of the house, that's one of the reasons I have him.Sturdy table and looks good."
5,Great for a baby named Maggie,The book was a little damaged when I received it which was upsetting as it was a gift. However the new mom was so excited that I found a book with her baby's name in the title it did not matter much. The book itself was short and not too interseting but I am sure baby Maggie will love hearing her name when her parents read her this book!
2,Typo...,There's a typographical error in this book. -- dissappointed as I planned to use this book as an educational piece for young children.
5,Great music- a little jazzier than some swing,"great to dance to. Fast, wonderful vocals and insturmentals. A little jazzy, but it grows on you fast. I love it"
2,The RCR fall short on this one............,"What the heck happened? The band that was once the top dog in the current swing revival falls flat on it's face on ""The Contender"" A band that at one time saw no rivals now finds itself struggling for relevance. Maybe the band can rebound on it's next album. In the meantime, your money would be better spent on getting your vintage spectators re-soled and heading to the next Big Bad Voodoo Daddy show for some real swing, baby."
5,"Even better than ""Mugzy's Move""!","Wow! Not only do Royal Crown Revue swing, they ROCK. They are back in fine form, in fact better than ever. The brass section is tight, intricate, and energetic. The drummer, an undeniable virtuoso of the skins, brings the house down on all the songs. The singing is flawless, as usual. The energy of the band will radiate through your stereo speakers, pick you up off your feet, and make you dance--you'll truly have no choice. Every song is enjoyable, but the true knockouts are the title track, ""Big Boss Lee,"" and the better-than-the-original ""Salt Peanuts."" HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. So can anyone tell me why they haven't become as popular as the equally talented Cherry Poppin' Daddies???"
2,NOt Danceable,The CD is not as good as their first one simply because most of the tunes aren't danceable. If you are just getting into swing avoid this one and look for some others. I hope they rebound on their next album.
4,smooth. Very smooth,"Listening to The Contender conjures images of smoky boxing gyms and humid nights, some where in the tropics. A smooth album, but with tracks that have that distinctive RCR sound (and speed). Its a bit slower than the live album 'caught in the act' however it will not dissapoint. Grab a cold beer, perhaps even a good red wine, sit outside on a summers night and enjoy."
4,Great Stories!!,"I really enjoyed ""Weird hikes"" and would like to see Bernstein write additional books in the same style. The stories were all entertaining and I was continually looking forward to picking up the book and reading about his next strange adventure! The book also re-ignited the hiking bug in me!!"
1,"Big dissappointment, title and description misleading","This book looked interesting according to the cover and back cover, but if you're into listening someone rave about their college drinking and other personal anecdotes ""not related to hiking!!!!"" then I would highly advise not getting this book. I'm sorry I spent the money on it. Next time I'll read more reviews before making a book purchase. It should have been under a different title in the fiction section."
4,Different and worth buying,"I liked this CD but found it harder to concentrate on the mysteries of the rosary as I was listening more to the meditations of Therese. It's different and lovely in content and I am enjoying it but still have another rosary on tape that I use often.I would recommend this as an addition to the ""standard ""rosary."
5,love it!,If you're looking for a rosary CD to listen to while you're driving to and from work this is definitely it! I've been listening to it every morning since I received it!
5,11 years...of Cheers,"Not many shows stand the test of time, but I enjoy the old episodes of this series as much, maybe even more, than when I saw them the first time. Thankfully Amazon has them available."
4,Cheers for the Final Season,One of the best final seasons I have ever watched. I now have the complete show. Must buy for CHEERS fans.
4,Good Entertainment,Fun entertainment at a fair price. Cheers! fans will love this final season to add to their collection.
5,Excellent,This completed my set of Cheers seasons and I could not be happier. I am looking forward to watching it.
4,Cheers has missing episodes,"One particular episode I remember was pertaining to the ongoing fued between Gary's Old Town tavern and Cheers. I believe this was in, or near, the final season when aired. In this episode Sam recalls when everyone in Cheers was involved in the gag that convinced Sam that Gary had actually died. He got even with his own gang in this episode by having a bus dump off some of the gang in the middle of nowhere with only only a phone near by. The gang calls Cheers where Sam answers and basically says ""Remember......... GOTCHA !"". That was a great episode that I haven't seen on the DVDs and I own all 11 seasons. There is another episode too pertaining to the time frame when lillith ran off with Dr Pascel that seems to be missing as well."
1,Incomprehensible,"Incomprehensible. Gobblygook logic. Great leaps to conclusions with scant evidence. Don't bother. Read Europe Between the Oceans: 9000 BC to AD 1000 by Barry Cunliffe, instead."
5,Gripping Tale of London's Poor Laced With Violence,"Without question, Paul Theroux has been among our most astute observers of human nature writing in the English language. In ""The Family Arsenal"", a terse, compelling look at crime in London's slums, Paul Theroux takes an unflinching, often brutal, look at the interplay between adverse poverty and crime. Furthermore he adds to this compelling mixture an intriguing look at IRA terrorism being waged on the streets of London. All of this is told through vivid, well-crafted prose. Fans of Paul Theroux's work will not be disappointed with his latest fictional excursion into an abyss of contemporary Western society."
5,Best Prospecting Book Ever Written!!,"I have made a living at the 50-100k level every year since I read this book (1986.) If you are a professional salesman, this book will tell you what the marketing department doesn't want you to know. (How to make a living without them!)Bill has stayed away from the ""firm handshake, good attitude"" school of thought. He understands how to take a statistical and sociological understanding of the US economy and turn it into M-O-N-E-Y. If you read and follow Bill's ideas, you will no longer have to try to answer the question ""If you are so smart how come you aren't rich?""If you sell for a living and you have not read this book, you probably are wasting 90% of your time.I will be greatful to Bill until the day I die. He has given me what I want out of life. FREEDOM"
5,Must have addition to any sales library -- not a rehash,"Although this book is tilted more toward the financial services industry, I got tons of tips and good information. The idea about ""thankyouverymuch"" changed my whole way of thinking about cold calls -- and instantly raised the number of calls I was able to make. I actually look forward to making these followup calls after having gone through Bill's book. Thankfully this book doesn't go over any of the tired old tips that others may discuss such as how to be pushy on the phone or how to get past gatekeepers. Bill's whole philosophy is that if someone doesn't want to talk to you then you should hit the flash button and be on to the next prospect as soon as possible."
2,not for everyone,"I'm sure this book has a purpose to someone, but , I did not find it useful at all. If you are planning to be a successful phone solicitor, and who does that anymore, this might be the book for you. I think it is outdated and not for this century."
4,pretty good case,"Used it once and think this is a great case for one-night trips. It is not for heavy duty use though, so don't put another heavy bag on top of it, it might bent the collapsiable handle a bit too much.The laptop case inside is perfect, and the front section has useful pockets for misc items.Recommended."
5,jaberwockies and space aliens,this band rules. aram looks like a turtle and jim is husky but handsome. buy this record or be a retard.
5,Great quotations book. Oxford seal of quality in every page.,"There is one single reason why I've bought this book: I was looking for the best quotation dictionary available, at a low price. Every now and then I want to use a quotation in a text I write concerning to my work as a lawyer, but I never found such a book in local bookshops. My search ended when I got to this book. Have yourself a copy as soon as you can. You won't regret. I assure you that."
5,Quintessential Industrial Rock,"This has to be one of the finest Industrial records I have heard in many a year. Its hardcore, its disco, its fun.It hits basslines that would excite even the frostiest women!!And it donesn't fall foul of what often occurs with Al's creations, repetitiveness.Revco Incarnate!!"
4,Now this is the cock I love!,"Listening to Cocked and Loaded was odd for me, because it was by no means bad, but it sure wasn't the Revco of old, back in the Beers Steers and Queers, Linger Ficken, big sexy days. This was a new beast entirely.I picked up Cocktail Mixxx because when Virgin Records was closing out, I found this in a bin for like four bucks or so, and I figured it couldn't hurt, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it's better than the original. For example, Pole Grinder isn't quite oldschool Revco, but it's certainly closer."
4,Good Ole Fun,"Good ole RC with a fun beat. If you like Techno, Industrial, and rock, you'll like this."
3,A fan but disappointed,"While I would consider myself a true fan of the National Team and Women's sports in particular this was disappointing. The manner in which the story was told--interweaving political, philosophical and societal ideology within the the context of one game was hard to withstand. I only finished the book trying to look past Longman's insights to the find the real point of the story--the team.When Longman focused on the team and their team dynamics I was in heaven."
3,The Authorized Version,"Some sports events catapult themselves onto the world stage--those who saw the 1980 Olympics hockey finals, for instance, will never forget them--and others are pushed onto that stage by a combination of media and corporate interests. The author writes his story as if it was the first snd yet who doubts it was the second?That doesn't take anything away from the atheletes or the event but I finished this book with a sense that there was a much more interesting story about money and marketing which was left untold. The book's title, lastly, is typical American arrogance: few people outside of the US paid the same attention to the women's world cup (in the rest of the world soccer is the masculine sport)."
3,Pedestrian Account Of A Great Team and Victory,"This is a competent account of the U.S. national women's soccer team and its victory in the 1999 Women's World Cup. Jere Longman structured the book around the final match with China. I suppose the idea was to build tension while flashing back to early matches and describing the players and the team in depth. I found the structure to be a major annoyance, however. A straight chronology and/or a chapter on each player probably would have been more effective. The lack of an index is annoying. The information and quotes are strong, but there are few new insights (Tiffeny Milbrett's comments on the older players being the most prominent). The pictures are a disappointment, centering on Michelle Akers' travails in the final with a few others. And as another review points out, there are plenty of typos. But the team is so inspiring that it carries this book."
1,Boycott Jere Longman,Please consider boycotting Jere Longman for his unprofessional attack piece on Olympic athlete Lolo Jones in teh New York Times.
4,1999 Womens Soccer,"Players go through alot not just on the field though, fighting for things that they believe in. People don't realize what hard work it takes. In being a women people dont give you as much recognision as they do male ball players. They dont get paid as much even though they work just as hard as male players do. In 1999 the U.S. womens soccer team showed the world that woman can do it.The Girls of Summer by Jere Longman shows and tells the woman's U.S. soccer teams struggles throughout there period of dominance in the 1999 Womans Wolrd Cup tournament. Jere Longman really told you about how people didn't think the Woman's World Cup would get recognision. The U.S. womans's team proved them wrong with there domination throughout the World Cup and there win againts China to win it all. The author really got into this and almost showed you what it is like to be a player."
4,Great read,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading about these fine atheletes, from the beginnings of the national team, through to that searingly hot day in July. The writer takes the reader inside the inner workings of the team as a whole, the players as individuals, as well as behind the scenes with the coaches, and the game. I particularly enjoyed the way the author brings us onto the field with the players during the final game. Relive the penalties, and actually feel it as the players did. As a female soccer player and a fan of the game, it is certainly one of the best ""soccer books"" I've read. My one complaint is that the text is littered with typos, ike it had been edited in a hurry."
5,nothing like hot water,"Finally the shower water doesn’t turn to an icy dribble when someone downstairs flushes a toilet. Perhaps a little noisy, and the motor cover was a little banged up on delivery, but easy to install and works perfectly. Wish I had it thirty years earlier."
4,pentair 3/4 hp water booster pump,"I purchased this pump too replace one I've had for 5 or 6 years. The pump I replaced was the same brand, it just spun a bearing. I use this booster pump for my yard irrigation only. Hook up was almost the same as the last pump. I don't know what the life span is on these pumps, I just hope this one lasts a year or 2 longer. I would recommend this pump. Dean T. in Minnesota"
3,Reference - NOT how to...,Not bad if all you want is a large book of definitions with little how to.
4,Great overview/basic reference,"This book is a must for anyone involved with databases. I first purchased this book for a college class, but now still use it as a basic reference for my daily work. This is a great overview book for someone with little or now programming experience. However, if you have been in the business for more than 1 year, I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,"Huge Reference, But of Very Little Value","This book is huge, at 1344 pages it is huge. But not at all useful. Information is too darn difficult to find, and more often that not it is simply not there. I could not find anything on Dynamic SQL, and very little on SQL Load - something a supposedly 'Complete Reference' of Oracle8 should cover. Also, the absolutely paucity of examples makes it difficult to figure out correct syntactical usage without at least some trial and error. Use one if available at your company or library or if you can borrow a copy - just don't waste money buying one - new or used."
4,Good reference on Oracle 8,"I found the book to be helpful in learning ORACLE 8 PL-SQL but each topic was poorly organized. For example the information pertaining to DECODE and join syntax was scattered in too many chapters within the book. While its information might be erroneous, I found SQL Unleashed to be organized better."
2,"Badly organized, No in-depth knowledge","I have a feeling that most of the oracle books from Oracle Press sucks. They try to cover everything, but unfortunately not in details, and only for beginners. Although I like Kevin Loney, I love his Oracle DBA 7.3, I don't like this. I hope Oracle Press can have more real books for professionals. Ones that can be referenced in the real world."
2,Disappointed...,"I would not consider this a complete reference by any stretch of the imagination. As I am currently serving as chief architect of a major internet portal, I purchased this book blindly in hopes of learning about Oracle. I was interested in advanced topics such as Oracle Parellel Server and Advanced Replication for which this book did not have. It is a rehash of existing manuals.Do not waste your money on this book."
4,A good 1-book reference,"You'll never find everything you want in one volume, but it's mighty handy to have a reference that covers most of the topics you need. This is not a tutorial. However, if you know some SQL and database concepts, this book will get you going on Oracle. There is a very good chapter on DECODE, and functions are covered well. I found the information on system catalogs useful, and I use the alphabetical reference all the time."
4,Complete but not for all...,"It's a good book for all people who want to have a panoramic idea of ""what is Oracle"", but it's not complete for database administration. For many people who was already a DBA with a good Knowledge of SQL language , the book is more dispersive, and it's not focused on the basics information that a DBA want to know like users administration, backups and so on Finally it is a good book, for all novice people of oracle."
3,I was dissapointed,"Sorry to disagree with all the other reviewers but I have some major misgivings about this book. Firstly, the author seems convinced that Relational Databases are so-called because of the way the different tables are related. If you've ready any serious books about databases (e.g. Date) you will know this simply is not so.And what about all the different versions of Oracle: Standard Edition, Enterprise Edition, Personal Oracle, Oracle Lite, the Oracle 8i appliance? There's no mention of these which is a pretty poor show for a book calling itself 'The Complete Reference'.I suppose if your boss suddenly says to you, ""By the way, we're switching to Oracle next week."" this could be a useful book, but if you're an application programmer charged with choosing a database platform this book is not much help at all."
4,Good book for quick reference,Extensively covered the SQLPLUS environment and good exapmles for generating reports at SQLPLUS prompt. Needs more coverage on PL/SQL programming and should be a handy tool for application developers also.
2,Should be better,"As with most other books from Oracle Press, this reference is incomplete and poorly organized. There's quite a bit of useful stuff in here, but most of the topics discussed are never delved into great detail--so it's very good for an overview, but if you actually want to get things working, you'll need to go elsewhere. I find the organization to be very strange."
3,The book is Good for the reference,We have purchased this book two months back. We are utilizing that book right from Technical Support to Faculty Utilization.
3,Beware the inaccuracies!,"There is probably a lot to recommend this book, but it gets obscured by careless blunders. For example, the loader utility is incorrectly named, and syntax for some statements is wrong. It's a big work to try to get right, but it's a ""complete reference"" that requires other reference works to complement it. It's better than Oracle documentation, though."
3,Quality reference,I was learning SQL and my manager recommended this book. I did not use most of the book as a beginner who was learning basic data retrieval. I was able to learn everything I needed to use SQL for my job. The layout is not ideal for learning but it was meant as a reference.
2,It's just too big to lift,"If you're doing Oracle programming, you probably need a complete reference. The question is: do you need this one?This book would be a lot more usable if if were broken down into a couple of paperback volumes, which you might be inclined to open and peruse from time to time. In this massive hardcover version, you'll only take it off the shelf when you get desperate."
4,Not as good!!!,I used to love Santa's White Christmas but it is not as good as it use to be not sure if they changed or me!!!
1,"Love the band, hate this calendar.","I am a huge U2 fan, buy their calendar every year. This years model is full of bad photos made worse by annoying notations intended to be informative, but are just annoying. This one may not even get displayed. I suggest you choose another calendar."
5,This is the best TV show I have ever watched!,"This show has something for everyone. Characters you will fall in love with by the end of the pilot, gunfights, swordfights, fistfights, shipfights, guys scarier than anything in latex, and the best fast-paced dialouge on this end of the 'verse. One of the cleverest TV shows out there (eat your heart out, LOST)."
1,Hope Mine works! And No Adapter!,Words can't express the shock I had that there was no AC adapter included with this $40 piece of hardware! My box also appeared to have been opened (there is a seal on it). I hope I didn't get one that you returned. I'll have to bring my adapter home from the office and check it out. I guess the low price on the Nino itself is offset by these pricey accessories.
4,Foundation of Western New Thought,"First, this is not an easy book to read, but it's importance in the study of metaphysics makes it well worth the effort. I am a practicing metaphysican and have been a student of metaphysics, theosphy and comparative religions for over 20 years and am just beginning to realize the truth contained in this and others of H.P.Blavatsky's books.This book is on my recommended list the serious student of metaphysics and esoteric knowledge. It has been an integral part of the foundation of the Western new age/new thought movements."
2,Abridged Version - Beware!,"As other reviewer wrote, this is an abridged version. It leaves out important sections of Blavatsky commentaries.If you are looking for the complete version of The Secret Doctrine, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK YOU NEED.I have found that these versions are complete, prepared specifically for the eReader, with an index of the original page order for those that want to use a reference for the printed version:The Secret Doctrine - Volume I, CosmogenesisThe Secret Doctrine - Volume II, Anthropogenesis"
2,The Secret Doctrine,I didn't realize this was a synopsis of the verses contained in the original work. I was very disappointed.
1,I dont care for this eddition,It is much better to buy the 2 full volumes. I feel hustled that I bought this. It gives madme Blavatsky's great work little justice. The two orginal volumes are much better.
5,Know thy enemy,"Very good book, learn what our leaders and those abroad believe and practice. Also recommend Two Babylons, Hope of the wicked and The thirteenth tribe."
3,keep looking,"My sons got this toy for their 1st birthday since their physical therapist recommended getting a push/ride on toy with a wide base for learning to walk. While they enjoy the buttons and sounds and like being pushed around on it, I do not find it helpful for development. The handle pushes forward and comes off very easily, it is not heavy enough for them to pull up on without tipping over onto them, and the seat is very wide and square so their legs will have to grow considerably before they would be able to ride it. Also some of the stickers are starting to peel off and we've only had it a month. For an older child it would probably make a decent ride on toy, but if you are wanting a push toy to help with early walking, keep looking."
3,Poorly made,"I bought this on clearance at Wal M--t today for less than $[...]. However, when I took it out of the box at home, 2 of the buttons were collapsed, stickers peeling off and the handle was loose. I thought it was just my luck from getting a clearance one, but I guess this is typical. I pried one of the buttons off with a flat head screwdriver and put a pencil eraser tip on the underside of it and wrapped a little piece of foil around the eraser tip. I pounded it back on with a rubber mallet and it works fine now. Obviously, maybe not the smartest way to fix it, but it works for the time being. If you find this super-cheap, it's worth it for the fun, my son is in love with it -- he doesn't care about the blemishes or defects. But I would never pay retail for the item."
3,"great, save for the fact it fell apart within days","My one year old is a unvarnished Thomas train junkie. His world up and starts with the DVD/film, TV series and his Scootin' train. However, with regards to the latter, after a week's worth of infrequent use the back handle by which you push your child around has come loose. Now it won't insert snugly again. This production flaw is a huge drawback making it nearly impossible to push my son around safely. Not much value here."
3,Missing piece,"My son does love his Thomas the Train. However, when I received this it was missing a screw that is used to hold the handle in place. This is the only thing needed to put it together, so I don't know why they couldn't have just put the screw in already. Now, I have to try and find a screw that will fit so the handle will stay on. The back piece is also very loose and comes out all the time.I do like the fact that it has two volume levels."
4,Handle not a big deal,"I bought this for my 1 year old. He sits on it, and my 3 year old pushes him around. The different music and sounds are great. It is one of the best parts of this toy. My 3 year old pushes it around singing ""Thomas, Thomas"". The handle does remove easily, but if pushed down, it doesn't move while being pushed around. It won't fall off if it is pushed down properly. Plus, it is nice that it folds, so it takes up less room in the closet!"
3,Not great quality but the kid loves it anyway,"My son received this from his grandparents. Within one week of getting it, one of the buttons that plays music stopped working. (not that we were terribly upset about that - this thing is loud) Within a month, two of the four buttons were out of commission. My son was less than a year old at the time and was not at all rough with it. The handle comes out way too easily. We gave up and stopped using it now that he's walking anyway. Even with all this - my son adores his train. He loves to scoot around on it."
2,Disappointing!,"My son received this as a gift for his first birthday from his grandparents. He was delighted for all the obvious reasons - it's a fun, rideable gigantic Thomas that plays all the fun songs. He ignored all other gifts for this one.However, I agree with everyone else's review...the black handle is absolutely ineffective. My husband even tried glueing it to make it work...it now lies on the floor in a corner of our dining room. The red handle is also very poor quality...turns in it's hole and comes out entirely. My son likes this, but I know it's not supposed to work that way. Lastly, the fun buttons that played the cute music have stopped working one by one. I haven't totally minded this, but it's been disappointing.If you're looking for a push toy, go elsewhere! I had no idea this toy was so expensive, and sincerely hope my mother in law paid less for such a poor quality item."
4,"Nice train sounds, nice big size. Handle has problem","I bought this after I heard the reviews said about the handle problem because I love this ride on so much when I actually saw it in store. But I finally decided to return it. It's big and roomy (even fit a very small size adult!) The sounds are nice and make you think about the old days in the train station. Not as annoying as the other ride on you see in market in my opinion. However, the back black handle (as other reviewers has mentioned) can easily be pull off when you push it in a certain position. The handle is absolutely not sturdy due to its design. I'm afraid my son would get hurt if he pushs it because it WILL fall off. I thought of removing the handle but then it will not look as nice and there will be a hole with rought plastic around it that it is not very good either. If that's not a problem for you, I recommend it. Otherwise, stay away from this toy."
2,Poor Quality,"Like others have said, the black handle/back comes off too easily and it winds up sitting in a corner somewhere. My 2 year-old who has never broken a toy or ripped a page in a book managed to break the button that plays the song - in just one month after receiving this toy. If a gentle child can easily break this toy, then I'd hate to see how long it (doesn't) last with a rough and tumble toddler."
3,"Fun, but the rear handle is really annoying","My son is 21 months old now, but I got him this Thomas toy quite some time ago.Overall, it is fun. He can only just now sit on the seat (it is wide and square, which requires a wide spread and frankly looks pretty uncomfortable). The main problem is that annoying black handle on the back. If you push forward more than down, it will pop out. Early on, my son fell a couple times due to it. Eventually he would just bring me the handle to put back on.No problems with buttons or stickers. The red handle has a little bit of play, but it hasn't had any problems.Overall, I like it, but that rear handle is crap. To the reviewer who said it is fine if used properly, tell that to a < 2 year old boy :)"
2,Cute but Poor Quality,"The train is very cute, but the design and quality is sub-standard. The Red Handle bar became loose after two days of gentle use by my 1 yr old son, and the black handle bar on the back keeps coming out when my son push the train, which causes him to fall. I would not recommend it until it is improved."
1,Mickey Gilley-Country,I am surprised that you sent this for a review. I called Amazon back in Febuary about this DVD.I guess that did not mean much so here it is again.The DVD was a pure piece of crap.In case you forgot what this review is about it is about Mickey Gilly-country.As for ordering again my feelings are SO/SO.
4,"Fun, funny family movie","Snowball Express harkens back to the days when Disney made live action family movies. This movie contains all Disney's standard jokes, pratfalls, and gags, which you'd think would make it boring. Surprisingly, it's not. The Rocky Mountains setting and snow covered landscape really add to the comedy and fun. Of note: The scene where Dean Jones attempts to ski for the first time is predictable, but still hilarious. This is a safe choice for families with pre-teen children that want to have a fun movie night at home."
5,Gone but not forgotten,"My mom and I saw this movie at the theater in 1972 and every so often she would say ""do you remember the Snowball Express?"" Well after searching on-line at Amazon, I bought it for her for Christmas. She was ecstatic. She and my three kids watched it and ""howled"" with laughter. She had to tell her sister about the big ""find"" and they re-watched again. It was by far the best Christmas present."
3,Like,I remember watching this movie as a kid and I still enjoyed watching it now. I like collecting movies that I remember seeing when I was younger so that my kids experience some of what I was exposed to as a child.
5,snowball express,love this movie! A classic... great fun for the family! Great story line with lots of family values. photography and acting was great
5,Snowball Express,"This movie has a special meaning to us, We were at the drive-in theater and had just seen The World's Greatest Athlete and the Snowball Express was the next feature. Just as this movie was beginning, our unborn child decided to come."
5,Snowball express,Oh my gosh! We used to watch this every Christmas when I was kid!I am so glad to have my own copy.
4,Good Family Movie,This is one of those movies you remember as a kid. Very old time movie and it is fun for all ages.
4,great entertainment,I remember this from the days of Harry Morgan and Dean Jones great cast and it reminds us that Murphy's Law is alive and well at Disney.
5,Family Fun at its Finest!,"I have such fond memories of watching this movie with my parents and my sister. We watched this movie every time we went on a skiing vacation or whenever we needed a good laugh. I am disappointed that the film is not released at this time. I hope that Disney will release it again soon so that I can share this film with my family again and, eventually, with my own children!"
4,"Hilarious, typical Disney 1970s fluff.","Released by Disney in the 1970s, it is typical Disney 70's style. This time Dean Jones plays an accountant fleeing the rat race of city life,via the inheritance of a delapadated ski resort. Complete with Keenan Wynn, once again, playing the villian (remember, The Absent Minded Professor and Herbie Rides Again)."
4,Great family film!,This is a great family movie that my family and I watch every chance we get on the Disney channel. Dean Jones and his brood move from the city to the snowy slopes of Colorado to run a ski resort in dire need of repair. Do they get the repairs done? Do they raise enough money to keep the resort going? Do they have a lot of fun? (Hint: it's a Disney movie - what kind of ending can there be?) Plenty of humor also.
3,Family fun in Colorado mountains,Dean Jones moves family from the city to Colorado mountains when he inherits a hotel -- only his hotel needs a little work!
2,not as family friendly as I would have liked,"After reading all the other reviews I bought this for my family to watch. I was a little disappointed. There were many uncalled for references to sexual things. It was still better than most movies, but the one part that really annoyed me was that the main character told a female co-worker how her hot legs got him through all his years of employment with a company. HE IS MARRIED!!!!!! I am trying to teach my children that sex is a beautiful thing between a husband and a wife. Lustful thoughts about someone other than your spouse is not right. Yet, I gave them this dvd as a form of entertainment that goes against my teachings."
4,Snow Ball Express,This is a great movie for the family. Everone will enjoy it Dean Jones is timelss as are all the others players. Just good clean family fun. I don't even remember hearing a bad word in the whole movie.
4,Snowball Express - Simply terrific,"I saw this movie years ago, when I was just a kid and could'nt even remember it when I saw it on DVD. However, its just another great family film from Disney who never fail to deliver quality entertainment.The story concerns a family who've inherited the grand Imperial Hotel and Dean Jones character decides to move the family to Silver Hills Colorado. However, all is not easy from the start and the whole family encounter one trouble after another.Action sequences aplenty, and a lot of snow, naturally.I wont say anymore except, add this one to your collection, if your family appreciates good old family entertainment. Sure as hell beats a lot of rubbish on televison these days."
5,Simply a Classic,"When I was young and HBO first came on the air, I'd watch this movie evrytime I knew it was going to be on. I never got tired of it. Now it's over twenty years later and I want the DVD. It belongs in every Family Films collection."
4,"5 star movie, one star dvd","I bought this DVD without having seen the movie before... I just knew that I generally liked Dean Jones, and the simple style of movies he did for Disney in the late 60's/early 70's. We we sat down to watch this, we were very pleased with it. Our kid is probably too small to get it and sit through it now, but I can see it being a lot of fun for him when he gets older. It really has all the markings of a fun family movie. I just would have liked to have seen a better effort by Disney on the DVD itself."
3,A Fun Disney Film,"John Baxter, an accountant from New York, inherits a Colorado hotel from a great Uncle. Tired of the rat race, John packs up his family and moves to Colorado, imainging a new life as the owner of a prosperous hotel. Unfortunately, all is not as he had hoped: the hotel is way, way, way out of town and is in desparate need of repair. Baxter tries to get a loan from local banker, Martin Ridgeway, who has his own ideas about sneaking the hotel away from Baxter.This is a great movie for anyone between the ages of 5 and 13, who will probalby like all the slapstick humor and silly situations in which Baxter finds himself as he tries to get the money to keep his hotel from foreclosure. ( I remember really enjoying this movie as a kid. Now, the film seems a bit out-dated, the humor somewhat forced.) The acting is good, with many well-known stars: Harry Morgan, Dean Jones, Keenen Wynne, and Mary Wickes.The DVD has no extras. It's a fun Disney film that kids are sure to enjoy."
3,Not exactly as advertised,"These fit my Palm V well but they are not the same model as the stylus that came with the Palm. They're made of plastic instead of metal and they don't have the built-in reset pin. I guess this is all we can get as a simple replacement though. If you know where find a metal one with the reset pin, I'm all ears."
3,If you lose the orginal stylus,"Palm comes with a stylus. If you lose it then buy this, otherwise it's a waste. And by the way, if you have long fingernails you can use that to input into your Palm when you're too lazy to take the stylus out"
3,Wierd,"Although the replacement pack seems quite reasonable i did find that they dont fit into the silo as easy as the original one. Im not sure why this is the case but for some strange reason it doesnt fit comfortably. But even if it did, i dont recommend getting it. If your serious about being a PDA user, i recommend getting a multipen with a stylus tip. Those work much much better"
5,Great quality product!,The stylus fits perfectly in my antiquated palm pilot and I really like the weight of the stylus. My pda might be old but it works for me. Thank you very much!
4,Seller with integrity worth more than the item,"After being given an old Palm Pilot (with no stylus), I purchased a set of 3 from my seller. It arrived more quickly than I had expected, but the envelope was torn and one of the styluses was lost. When I notified the seller (merely to suggest that he change his choice of mailing envelope- I was fine with the 2 I received), he credited me for the full amount (including the shipping).It's always so nice to be pleasantly surprised, and I was!"
5,Fast,"It got here fast, and it works wonderfully. I would recommend it as it is fairly cheap, and works beautifully."
3,works good for awhile,"this works good, but after a year or 2 it would get dissconncted from the ps3 or tv and not work untill i adjusted it, this happenbs once or twice a month. also even though my ps3 is set to use the hdmi sometimes it dosent rememebr and recognize that it is connected so i have to then adjust the ps3 video output. this get annoying, i dont know if that problem is the hdmi or the ps3. but to sum it all up, it works very good, sometimes it gets disconected."
5,ps3 hdmi cable,"I had to cancel this order in the last minute, and the service which I receive was great."
1,"Poor cable, would not support 1080P","I would not recommend this cable at all. I purchased this cable in order to hook up a PS3 to a Samsung 40"" LCD TV. The highest setting I could get though was 1080I. I subsequently purchased another cheaper HDMI cable from Amazon and had no issues at all getting set up at 1080P.Here is the cable I bought that worked:Inspire HDMI (2 meter) 6 foot cable HQ 1080P 1.3bSold by: BrilliantStore"
1,Cable does not work!,This cable did not work with any of my equipment. I ordered it with my PS3 to connect directly to my TV. I had no signal at all. Also tried from my HD cable box to the TV and had no better luck.I tried my PS3 with another HDMI cable and had no problems.Don't buy this cable.
1,Verify before you buy....,"Although this seems to be a fairly well constructed cable for the price, it does not appear to be 1.3 compliant. Avoid the hype that it says it's for PS3. If your TV requires an HDMI 1.3 compliant cable, you will not get better than 1080i, or in my case, garbled video. Nowhere on the packaging could I find the spec, even on the MFR's web site."
2,Not good enough,"I bought my PS3 and all the bits to get my GT5 Prologue working on my 1080p tv and was disappointed...The PS3 was fine playing a Blu-Ray movie, but even the opening credits on Gran Turismo we just breaking up all the time. I did a lot of reading and the whole debate about how a $10 cable will do the same as a $70 on etc... well I ditched this cable for a Monster 1000hdmi and guess what.. now I have flawless audio and display in 1080p with not even a hint of a problem.If you are having a similar problem, you will have to make up your own mind. I don't think the build quality of this cable is that good and given the movies work and game didn't, I am more like to believe that it just wasn't capable bandwidth wise to do the job."
2,Could not transfer 1080p for me,"I used this cable to connect PS3 to 50"" plasma, and when I tried to set the resolution to 1080p the screen went blank. The most it could handle was 1080i. I got another HDMI cable from Walmart (for much the same price) and it worked. My guess is this cable does not conform to 1.3a standards."
2,Overpriced HDMI cables,Although these are nice hdmi cables its overpriced. Usually what makes a good cable is cables that are well shielded with good connection points. Since HDMI cables are pure digital cable just get much cheaper version. You won't be able to tell the difference. Also just because its PS3 hdmi cable don't mean its designed specially for it. Any decent quality hdmi cable will do that job.
2,not so good,"i have some problems with this cable. it wont work with 1080P, works with 1080i. i have 46"" samsung lcd and i can be in 1080p almost 2 weeks after this time i must low to 1080i cause the cable didnt support 1080p"
4,"HDMI Quality, Super Price","I'm having problems with my eyes currently, but if I wasn't i know this would be awesome looking. I use it for my PS3 which i only really play uncharted on. The price was phenomenal especially with what the other people where charging. Overall good."
1,Waste of money,"I have used this cable on multiple HD Tv's & anyone who says they can see a difference is a LIAR! On paper this is better, but I have compared side by side w/ the PS3 standard cables & cannot tell a difference/ I have also done this on multiple different HD TV's"
1,Poor cable choice,"This is not a good choice of cable for anything - I could not get about 720p resolution from connecting it to a PS3 and then when I swaped it for the HDMI I had connected to my DVR, all I got was mostly static - this item was returned! Do not waste your time in buying this."
1,Why is this labelled a PS3 Cable??????,"I purchased this cable and hooked it up to find out that I could only transmit 1080i through it, instead of the full 1080p that the PS3 can output. Of course it took me a while to realize it was the cable because this one is hyped up to be the ""PS3"" cable. I tried a $20 cable from Sams, and a free HDMI cable I got from my cable company and they both worked great at 1080p even though they had no indication of being a PS3 cable. Be sure to pick up a HDMI cable which supports HDMI version 1.3."
2,Overpriced Garbage,"This HDMI cable is not very good value for money. You can get much better cables at whatever length you want for much less at certain online vendors. Not sure why they market this cable specifically for the PS3, maybe the color scheme?All in all just get a different cable."
1,Horrible quality cable!!,"I've bought this cable about a year ago and the first cable i got in the mail didn't work(it didn't go past 480p no matter how hard i tried and if it by chance did display at 720p it would be staticy). I sent it back got a new one of the same cable. Both cables for some odd reason is permanently bent from the way it's package. Though this one did work and actually displayed at 1080p. Now nearly a year from purchase it doesn't work. All i did was disconnect it so i could reorganize my tv/360/ps3 setup and it won't work. My other HDMI cable which is of way better quality works not to mention i bought this better cable for 5 cents($3 including shipping) compared to the 20 bucks i spent on this piece of junk.Stay away, this product is overpriced, packaged horribly, doesn't work after regular movements, and there are just better overall cables out there."
1,Do NOT buy!,"I purchased a new HD 1080 TV and a playstation 3 a couple of months ago. I was using a Belkin HDMI cable I purchased for both cable tv and the PS3, switching back and forth whenever I wanted to use the other device. I decided to purchase this cable since the price was so low (compared to the 45 dollars for the Belkin) and since it had good reviews. I received the cable and plugged it in right away. To be as nice as I can, the quality was terrible. It was grainy and had a lot of static in the picture. I switched between the Belkin and this cable to make sure it wasn't a poor port or something else but everything I tried led back to this cable. DO not buy this. It is not worth the price and you will end up with an inferior product and a terrible picture. Luckily amazon let me return the cable however I am now without a HDMI cable for even longer!"
2,Be Careful with this Product.,"I hooked this up and sometimes the picture would go out. So I switched cables, from my cable box to the PS3 and it hasn't given me any problems since. I'm not sure what the specific problem is, so buyers beware."
2,Drugstore quality,"I read all the reviews on this product so decided to try it as a leave-in. I am convinced the people that write these reviews see what they want to see instead of evaluating honestly.This product did nothing more than under quality drugstore brands. In fact, my hair was softer and combed out better BEFORE I put this product on.When I went to dry my hair it snagged and was not any noticeably softer. My plan is to eliminate this step next wash.This product is a waste of money and don't believe the hype."
5,My only must-have hair product,"I swear by this conditioner. I've never had much luck with other Bumble & Bumble products, but I cannot live without the leave in. I use it in addition to my regular shampoo and conditioner, and it leaves my wavy hair smooth and silky."
4,Great if your a fan,"As a Steeler fan, it is nice to play Madden with my Team's Gear. However, the right and left sticks are real smooth not giving as much comfort as the original controller. I have only seen these in the corded version. A wireless version with better stick surfaces would be a huge upgrade. Overall, nice controller."
4,"Great pan, way too expensive",Love the pan. It's a good weight and sturdy. But the price is very high. Obviously I bought it anyway but only because Norpro didn't sell this size for way less and just as high quality.
5,complete and thorough,I have found the book to be a great help in understanding the early part of Isaiah. It arrived in a timely manner. Good packaging.
3,Not what I expected,To be honest this isnt what I expected for the price I paid. It's is rather flimsy and made of plastic (which I did not know). It looks cheaply made but it works fine and it does set the arrows like I wanted.I just think the price is a bit too high for what you actually receive.
4,Gets the job done...,"This card gets the job done. For may of us who don't have the latest high-end systems, this card is for you. I recommend getting 2 and connect together via SLI to get 1024x768 resolution."
2,Bad with DirectX,"This card came with my computer 3 years ago. We've never been able to use it becuase of its incapatability with DirectX 8. The company that manufactures it, 3dfx, went out of business a while ago and is no longer making new drivers for the card. I would avoid all the trouble and get a different card."
2,It's Cheap.. Just Like What You Get For Your Money!,This is a terrible piece of graphic card. It was good back in '99 but it is not good now. Most games now require 16MB. This only has a shockingly bad 12MB! The only thing you can play with this is StarCraft. Go get a GeForce3 or Voodoo5. Don't waste your time on this 2 year old card.
5,Great information in an easy-to-use format,"My husband and I got our Jack Russell sort of by accident, and thus didn't really know what we were getting ourselves into. While we don't regret getting our dog for one second, we DID have quite a learning curve as neither of us had ever owned such a quirky, smart (but stubborn!) dog before. We have purchased several books on the topic, but the Dummies guide is by far the best resource we've found for answering questions about feeding, training, behavior, et al. The format really helps -- the information is easy to find and doesn't require super-sleuthing methods in order to unbury it as we found other books did. I highly recommend it."
5,Has Jacks down!,"This book really gets to the core of the Jack Russell Terrier. It was great to read that the quirky habits mine have are totally normal! (Well, for Jacks!) A well put together book that is a huge help for any JRT owner or anyone wanting to know more about the amazing and fun breed."
2,Book for Dummies not JRT's,This book was a waste. It does not specify and detail information about this particular breed which in the case of a JRT needs to be VERY specific. It is written for Dummies that never had any dog but not for someone needing urgent help to deal with a JRT.
5,Jack Russel Terriers for Dummies,This is a very good book. A lifeline in a troubled sea of dog woes.
3,Bad advice about laser tag,"This book offers a lot of great information about JRT's however they are TOTALLY wrong about using laser light to play with your dog. This is a devastating technique. We adopted a young JRT who was trained with this and it has been a nightmare to get him away from following light. He will obsessively stand in one spot when there is light and he can see his shadow. I have worked hard to break him of this habit and after two years he is coming along. If you cannot exercise or play with your Jack, do not get him. Terriers need and want tons of attention and action."
2,Sorry I didn't get much out of it,"I know that the book is for dummies. I kept saying ""Duh, teach me something new and effective."" The book was heavy on the traits. I now know about the breed but I need solutions"
3,Elementary,"Guess it does say ""for dummies"" but I still thought this book as a little too elementary. Also, tired of hearing what bad qualities JRTs have -- a little too heavy on the negative side, I felt. Frankly, I didn't get a lot out of this book that was useful to me, a first-time JRT owner."
3,True,The book basically tells what everyone already thinks they know about JRT's but nothing does these dogs more justice than having one.
2,Buy only if you already know statistics,"I had hoped this book would explain the statistical techniques themselves before jumping into how to use Excel, which is all it really does. If you already know statistics (which I did not) and don't know Excel (which I did) this will help. If the reverse is true, keep looking."
4,Stats,It would be perfect if I was running the year it was targeded for. Overall it aided in my class.
4,One Of The Best Christmas CDs I own,"Great Christmas album! I could listen to songs like 'Bethlehem', and Chaka Khan's solo songs all day long! 'Away In The Manger' and 'Silent Night' are worthy renditions. However, I thought that some of the songs such as 'O Come All Ye. . ' and the Angels Medley were a bit too jazzy and big band for me. I prefer true cool souflful music rather than those versions. The Christmas Medley is excellent in spite of the catroonish sound of 'Jingle Bells'. All in all, in spite of some of the fast tunes which don't do much for it, get this CD!"
1,Watch out if you have a Nikon D1H or D1X!,"Yeah, the card was great--until it crashed. Of 3 serial numbers, 2 are incompatible with Nikon's D1X and D1H. The only one that works ends in OE1B, and it affects the 512 and 256 40x, and the 1G 32x cards. Now I have to send out both my camera and my card to get updated, although I think my card's completely corrupt--my reader won't even acknowledge it. :("
1,COMPACT FLASH PRO 40X 512MB,"Took over a month to get and arrived defective. Tried contacting Lexar ""Live 24 hr Support"" no one answered... there are other choices that will work with much less hassle, suggest you pick something else."
5,Very Excellant,>Sings with a contemporary flare but with out trying to redefine Salsa. The ritmo is there and his voice helps to bring out the passion that is Salsa.
1,USA Buyer indeed be beware!!,"Yes, this DVD must be PAL formatted - indeed it is a Region 0 DVD but you get a horribly ""scrambled"" picture on a (my) stand alone DVD Player. I can't even get it to play on my computer's DVD player!!!Anyway, the UPC barcode on my unplayable copy is 8 72967 00639 1. Maybe some bozo at the factory put the PAL format in the wrong (NTSC) case? I do know a PAL version exists."
2,"Same issue, wouldn't play.","I actually did not buy this from Amazon, but bought it in a local record store. While it looked amazingly awesome from the tracklist, it would not play in my regular (pretty new) Sony DVD player, because of a region error.What is important to note is that, while Amazon has ""corrected"" their listing to show it is a PAL format, the ACTUAL DVD BOX SAYS NTSC. I have a number of ""imported"" DVD's from metal bands, which have the Region 0 or all Region Code, and are NTSC, and work fine. In fact, that's the way their recent live DVD/CD release is, and it plays wonderfully.But this one seems to have inherent problems in the region formatting for US folk, no matter where you buy it from. Too bad, but good to be aware!"
3,maybe?....maybe not !,my box says region 0 on it...plays o.k. in my old dell dimension 8200 (w/power dvd software)did freeze up in 1 spot about half-way through...plays fine in my xbox360...won't play at all in my jvc hr-xvc20u dvd player(only one of the few dvd's i ever bought that this won't play)...so kind of a mixed bag.if you are a grave digger fan and can put up with the few problems (and can buy it cheap) i would say go for it.great playlist of digger tunes.if you only have one device for dvd playback and no other options i might think twice about buying this one.
4,Pretty good drive,"The drive works just as I expected. As with other reviewers, it's missing 1 star because of the cap on the USB plug. It comes off pretty easily. In spite of that, I'd still recommend it."
2,Slow mo,"It works as advertised, but loading mp3's onto it can take a very long time for some reason. I was using a SD card in it. I suppose perhaps my usb port is a slow one.JL"
1,Only works 2 month,On decembre 2003 I did buy this and now I doesnt work anymore.In Lexar web site there is nothing about how to return it.
4,it works,"I use this device with memory stick from my Sony digital camera. It works as advertised -- no hassels, nothing. I didn't give it 5-star for two reasons:1) the plastic casing is cheap and fragile2) the size of the casing make it difficult to plug into some USB ports if there is another port (USB, mouse, keyboard, whatever) near by."
5,"Rare medium, well done","These are 1930's recordings, so don't expect super audio fidelity. But Wolf's songs are presented here by a collection of fine singers, with two booklets included to provide complete texts and considerable background regarding the performers and the society. I've played 3 of the 5 volumes so far - this is not something to rush - and have been delighted with the quality of the recordings, given their age, and of the performances."
3,interesting,"I've noticed that the reviews seem to be good or bad, depending on if the reviewer agrees or disagrees with the filmmaker's perspective. I'm fairly new to the wine hobby, so the subject matter was also pretty new to me. It was certainly interesting to see perspectives from a variety of people in the industry. It is also interesting to see the behind-the-scenes politics of wine. The filmmaker has an opinion, but I don't think it was overly stressed as all subjects spoke for themselves; i.e., he edited the film, but didn't put words into anyone's mouth.As some have mentioned, the camera work is terrible, but the film is much more about what's being said than about what's being filmed. Happily, the subtitles are stationary, so the shoddy filming didn't bother me much. I'd recommend it for someone who, like myself, has a passion (or developing passion) for wine. For someone not particularly interested in wine, it's probably not worth watching."
4,The inside story of the wine industry,An excellent (but long) documentary on the wine industry. Some funny lines about Mondavi Family wines. Beautiful landscapes of wineries in Europe and in California. You'll never look at a glass of wine the same way again.
1,nauseating...,"As much as this is an interesting subject with some historical merit, this is by far the most annoying documentary i have ever seen. the camera work is truly neurotic and extremely distracting. The filmmaker either had too much to drink during the shoot or he was too cheap to hire someone who knew how to handle a camera. Seriously folks, save your money and buy yourself a nice bottle of Bordeaux."
1,Frustration,The disc sent is restricted to Area 1 and my machine is unable to play it. What do you suggest?
2,Rants between naps,"Okay documentary. Another world could be created in the time it takes to watch it, but inspiring -- I suppose. It was a great idea gone wrong and just too many damned dogs."
1,No Subtitles,"I got this DVD as a present. I don't understand spoken French, Spanish or Italian and there are no subtitles with this disc. I tried it on two different DVD players as well as my computer. Basically worthless unless you can understand all the foreign languages and don't need subtitles."
2,I didn't realize what I was buying,"When I bought this film, I suppose I created my own problem by purchasing it as a spur of the moment thing when I also ordered Bottle Shock. I think there was an extra link when I ordered the other movie and I just picked this up too because it was ""a wine documentary"".I didn't realize it was really more of a propaganda thing with someone pushing their own point of view. I'm not going to say his point of view was wrnog, but the film is so over the top biased that it gets a little insulting. I did find parts of it interesting but as I said, it sort of loses any credibility along the way when you can see the bias in pretty much every scene. I ended up not finishing the movie because I was tired and will probably get around to watching the rest of it one day, but if I had the purchase to do over again, I would skip this one."
4,For wine lovers only,I personally enjoyed this documentary. It gives some insight into the wine industry and the politics associated with it. It is however truly a 'documentary' with no 'story line' and would probably be of minimal interest except to those of us who already love wine.
1,No subtitles,"You have to be a polyglot to understand this one. The version I got had no subtitles. Languages vary from Portuguese to French to Spanish to Italian ... No subtitles, no other languages.Unacceptable."
4,Mondovino,"This is a fascinating movie for those with strong interest in the politics and economics of the wordwide wine industry.For the more casual viewer the length of the film and reliance on subtitles may have a slumber effect!The filmmakeer clearly has a strong point of view in this documentary style work of 3 hours plus.The messsage appears to be only the winemakers in the old world( Notably France)deserve to be recognized. New World success stories notably the Mondavi family,are purveyors of fast food (drink) Old World""collaberators"" ( Frescobaldis , Mouton Rothschild) with the New World are the equivalent of McDonald's franchisees on the Champs Elyssee!"
4,Stiga Table Tennis Balls,This product was used in a Firehouse were Table Tennis is a popular sport and the competition is fierce. For whatever reason we have used Halex balls alot and i think this is the first time for using Stiga brand balls. We were satisfied at the durablity of the balls. Each ball gave us alot of mileage before cracking and even then it was probably aided by one of the guys hitting it hard off of our cement floor. It would be nice to be able to get this ball in Yellow instead of white. These balls had a nice bounce and weight to them...control of spins and ball flight were very precise
2,Not very engaging.,This movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from Russian captivity. The film covers the experiences of a veteran German officer assigned as an advisor to a Rumanian Army Corps on the eve of the Stalingrad encirclement. The film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of Stalingrad. One must think that it even disappointed it's original German viewers of the 1950's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of Stalingrad and the Nazi era.As an anti-war film this film is a failure; as a shoot 'em up action war film it is droll. All in all this is less satisfying than a made for TV movie of the same period.
5,Neo Traditionalist Supreme,"When Randy Travis blew into town, Country Music finally got off of it's knees and took it's place back at the front of the line. Thank God for Randy, Dwight, Patty, Marty, and George Strait. This album covers those Travis numbers that topped the charts, and when you listen to this CD, you'll soon realize why they reached number 1. Included here are ""1982"", ""Look Heart"", and ""Diggin up Bones""...all great traditional country hits. But my personal Randy Travis favorite is his cover of Sonny James' ""It's Just a Matter of Time"". Many compared Randy to George Jones, and he did in fact carry forward some of Jones' syle; but there was no doubt that Randy was more influenced by Lefty Frizzel. This is a great album, well worth your money."
1,Fanciful but fallacious ideas,"Professor Condit has written an inventive book, but it does not do justice to modern literary criticism. Its creativity is not faithful to Chaucer or to what we have learned about his life and his world in recent decades. Professor Condit often seems to have let his imagination get the better of him, at the expense of accurate and thorough historical and literary exposition."
2,Ordered 10.5 received 10.5 fit my son's size 13 feet,The shoes are very nice. My son loves them. Unfortunetly they were for me. The sizing is way wrong.
5,Helps your muscles after exercise!,I take 1 capsule after exercising (running for 1 hr + weights) and ii has helped my muscles recover faster
2,Didn't notice a difference,I didn't really notice any change while taking this product. My recovery time seemed the same. Other products on the market seem to be better at decreasing soreness and recovery time. Check out ON's recovery drink. Worked wonders for me.
2,Confused!!!,Not sure why but I did not see any results from taking this supplement. Plan to not purchase again and gave away the rest of my pills to my sister; hopefully it works for her...
3,Helps a little.,Not a big difference in relieving joint pain but any little bit is better than nothing. Price is fair on this one.
4,Great for over wroked muscles.,"I tend to over work my muscles with Volleyball, lifting weights, and cardio. I was getting a lot of leg cramps. After I started taking this, the cramps stopped. I knew that I was staying hydrated so it had to be something else. The trainer at the gym recommended this. It help me from the first day."
4,"It ain't sexy, but it works","I couple my use of glutamine with other, more ""sexy"" supplements. I've read on the benefits of glutamine supplementation and have added it to my mix, though I admit a user's not going to come away going ""Wow, I feel incredible after using this product"". At any rate, I've attained some goals during my workouts that I'm sure have something to do with my recent addition of glutamine. This particular product is a good size that allows you to discover whether glutamine is right for you without breaking the bank. The pills aren't incredibly huge and they're easy to digest with your favorite beverage."
2,battery died,it was nice while it was working but I believe the battery stopped working after a month or two of using the remote keyless entry
4,NO ONE READS MY REVIEWS,"Lot's of beautiful painting reproductions, church prayers, dictionary, study pages and a few other things. It's written in two column text. It's printed on thin magazine paper. Words of Christ are not red lettered. This is standard with RSV versions. It also lacks a silk ribbon marker. The great number of paintings is definitely a big attraction to this Bible, but I wish they were spread out a little more instead of lumping them together in only a few sections. The biggest saving grace is A Harmony Of The Gospels section. This gives chapters and verses, putting all four Gospels in chronological order."
1,not worth it,although the graphics were good had problems with pc shutdown. as a result i will never buy voodoo again. don't make the mistake i did.
2,Choose another one...,"I bought this card when it was first released for a prety high price at the time..! If you want to upgrade your computer I would say, GO for the voodoo 4 or 5, or any other brand of your preference... This card was really good at first, but I can say that although it still handles heavy games with pretty good frame rates in my DURON 700MHZ system, it lacks some new technology, like the 32BIT color support..! If you really want your frame rates to get high, go for another brand, or the voodoo 4 or 5!"
4,Still Have It,"I've had the Voodoo3 2000 on my pc for the past 2 years and still can't seem to have the need to change it to something else.I'm a heavy on-line gamer and am very happy with this video card. Just have to work the jagged edges on some games though. Other than that, I have no regrets owning one."
4,Great Card for a Great Price!,"I got the card for one reason... hard core games! So far I have loved the upgrade. The only problem that I had was that HP and Voodoo don't get along too well, but with a little a little help from a friend (my hammer)I got it working withouth a hitch. No for real, it took a bit to make it work right, being that HP has onboard video. After putting the card in I downloaded 3DMark 2000 and found out that the card does better than my computer does when it comes to 3D. For the price, you can't beat it, but if you got the little bit extra got for the 3000, I think it'll be worth the extra $$."
2,This card is good at first................,"This card is widely available for all games. It has good graphics. It is almost the best card ever, or is it. The only problem with this card is that after a few years of maybe, 2 or 3, the card will overheat and if your computer is not vented well enough, you have to take off the shell. If you want a card for a little while I highly recommend it. If you want it to last, your looking at the wrong card."
2,Too Hot to Handle,"I recently upgrade my comp. to celeron 433 and graphic card to Voodoo3 2000 AGP and hope to get a decent picture quality for the movie. Well, the quality of picture is good, but, my computer crashed daily (blue screen) because of the excessive heat of the VDO card. Driver that came with the package was not work, neither did the updated driver on the net. This happend even when I use 2 fans to help air circulation (one right on the heat sink, one one the PCI slot). I have 4 fans in my comp., does not do any good. I have to open the computer cover to releif the situation."
4,great card bad tech support,i like the card as i have no agp slot this was the best i couldget after buying it and disabling my intergrated graphics the cardworked great.
3,This voodoo3 2000 PCI was kind of bad for me..,"I thought this card was really good. I had a 8mb 3dcard and i was really hope to buy this card. But i dont had a AGP slot. So i could only get PCI.You know PCI is slower than AGP but i thought this card will be good enough for me. But it wasn't. I was playing action game which is Tribes. And i couldn't see the smooth screens.And i could see the jaggies from the charactors and buildings and 16mb is enough for games but.... its NOT enough memorys to make computer faster, i couldnt feel any faster speed from the computer. I hope you guys better get other 32mb or 64mb 3dcard but good thing was voodoo card supports many games."
2,Hmmmm.....,"...I finally got the card, and installed it with ease! Unfortunately nothing worked. It caused windows to crash regularilyand wouldn't work with any of my games!After some tweaking of refreash rates and my ""win.sys"", I finally got the card to work! But what about people that are new to computers! Not something I recommend for new comers looking to upgrade an existing machine!"
1,Worthless,"I was thoroughly disappointed in the performance and ease of installation of this video card. If you're looking to by an upgrade and your computer has an integrated video card, don't bother with this item. I spent thirty minutes on the phone (after being on hold for forty!) with the 3dfx support people and they still couldn't tell me what to do. I won't even begin to try and tell all the things wrong with the installation. Suffice to say that the instructions do not match what you see when you do it yourself. Do yourself a favor and buy a TNT2 card, you'll thank me later for it."
1,Lack luster board,"3dfx started off great at first. I purchased this board with the expectations of it delivering like it predecessors, but I was wrong. This board, in my opinion, was a rush job to match the tnt2 and other high performance video cards, hoping the the loyal supporters of the voodoo cards would again jump on the band wagon. The installation is easy, but getting it to work with your system is a major under taking with few ever becoming successful. It was a major disappointment to me. I could never get it to work, but I'm not alone. Check out the hundreds of other complaints to 3dfx on their own message. Many people are very disappointed. I am one of many."
5,I actually quite enjoyed this one.,"I'm a fan of short form science fiction, and this is one of the most under-appreciated collections I can recall. The enchantment lies in the unexplained premise behind most of the stories, situations that are taken for granted, as if they're perfectly normal. Such as the endless drive down an infinite highway mentioned in the Kirkus review. The writing is excellent and overall the collection is very entertaining."
4,"Literate SF, a rare bird","If, as the Kirkus Review notes, you merely want a book as entertainment, you'll be bored by Kessel's stories. His work is intelligent, literate, and is intended to challenge readers. A cut above the mindless formula of most science fiction."
3,Based on the episode with the same name.,"Ash and his friends come to Grandfather Canyon, where people from all over the World of Nintendo have come to dig up fossils. Ash says it's a good idea, because the idiot who came up with this experience invited everyone's least favorite %@!$@, Gary.But while digging, Ash runs into those mangy friends of Gary's, Jessie and James, who are plotting to blow up the canyon. The three of them and their Pokemon end up inside a cavern full of extinct Pokemon, including a giant Aerodactyl! Can Ash escape the jaws of death? Can Jigglypuff save the day? And... will someone drop Gary in that hole with the Rockets?!?The episode itself wasn't good, as it had Gary (who needs his @$$ kicked), and Ash's disobedient Charizard. (I think Gary stole Ash's Charmeleon-ball and replaced it with his own.) Still, I got a big laugh when Gary found a fossil of Pokemon poo-poo!"
4,Attack of the Prehistoric Pokemon Review,"This story is about where Ash,Misty,Brock and of course,the very cute pikachu encountered prehistoric pokemon.They fell in a cave that Team Rocket dug.Sometimes Ash gets a pokemon,sometimes not, but he does in this one!You know the charmander that evolved,well it evolved again into charizard!I think it's great!"
3,Songs Are Mis-labeled!,"As the customer above has already said, the songs listed on the cover are not the songs on the DVD! Because my mom is a fan of this group, I brought it for her, but she was not at all happy knowing, that there were different songs on this DVD! Not good, not good at all!"
4,"Surprisingly Poor DVD Release, Vol. 2","In an obviously crass attempt to force King Kong fans to buy both disks, the pilot, which was later split into two episodes, is divided between the two volumes, with only the second half on this disk and the first half onKing Kong, Vol. 1 (Animated TV Series). Worse, episode 5 is missing both its Coming Attractions and its End Credits, and Episode 7 is missing its Coming Attractions.All in all a rather shabby presentation of a long, long, LONG awaited DVD release."
5,Great movie,I loved this movie. Great quality picture. Recommend for those who enjoy musicals. Can be a bit graphic for younger children.
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Whatever power the musical might have had on stage is not in evidence in this filmed version of the play; instead of watching this nuetered version you'd be better served to watch the theatrical one with Depp and Bonham-Carter--it's not perfect, but it's better than watching a filmed stage play."
1,Don't Bother,"Landsbury and Hearn tripping over each other to hog the stage. Long vibratos as if it were a competition of who had the loudest and most obnoxious one. You couldn't even hear the pitch they were trying to ""sing"". Their vibratos weren't in sync, which just made it offensive to anyone with any taste whatsoever.Skip this one, and get the Burton rendition, you'll enjoy the simply told story that can stand on its own much, much more."
