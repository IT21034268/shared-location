3,Get a megapixel instead,"This model is definitely the most easy to use camera available, but it's the digital equivilant of a Polaroid... quick and easy shots, low quality pictures."
2,This camera is OVERPRICED!,The quality of the pictures (fair to average) are on par with cameras in the $100-$200 range. If you look at the resolution of other cameras listed in the $400 price range you will find others have mucher higher resolution. Im not sure who Sony is trying to fool but certainly not me.
4,"Use of 3.5"" floppies is the best!","My first digital camera looks like something out of a Cracker Jack box compared to this one! The lower of the Mavica line, it does not do video and may have a lower number of pixels, but I feel it is a really great camera for the price!Being able to store photos directly on disk is the greatest invention, and the menu/indexing screens allow you to view photos right away to decide if you want to continue or delete an image without having to wiat until they're on the computer screen.The battery has a long life, and recharging is quick and easy. Bought the package with the carrying case, which has room for camera, charger, and plenty of disks.Very happy with this camera overall!"
4,Limited,"Simple, and easy to use for what it does, this is starting to look a bit overpriced nowadays. On the good side, you can use common floppy discs to save your pictures, the batteries last for ages and it's extremely easy to use, but on the other hand the resolution (640x480 in hi-res) isn't good enough for anything more than simple holiday snaps. If you're prepared to do lots of re-touching you can use it as a useful image aquisition tool, and the lack of resolution can be a creative spur intself, but for anything more than simple web-site images and casual snaps you'd be better off with a proper megapixel camera with some kind of smart-card memory storage."
5,Killer first Digital Camera!,"I just recently purchased this camera, and I have to say that it has made taking pictures fun. The greatest part is that I don't have to wait forever to get my pictures back, being that the pictures are saved to a floppy disk. I simply snap the shot, look at the finished product to see if I want to keep it, and print it out within a matter of a minute of two. For those of you with new baby's(like my 9 month old), this is awesome. The zoom function is so good that I am taking the camera to a Laker game tonight to use as binoculars. I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking to get into digital imagery."
2,did not like,The images always seemed out of focus. I read the manual word for word and nothing helped. For every image I took there was a ghost image sitting beside it that had to be deleted to get it out of the way. I tried different kind of disks to no avail. I tried the disk in different computers with the same results. I would not recommend this camera.
3,If you like hard copies...this camera isn't for you,"Given camera as a gift, and as a novice is incredibly easy to use. However...I quickly discovered (after spending nearly $100 on prints) that obtaining quality 4x6 prints is not an option. In order to get decent resolution I am limited to wallet sized pictures. Bottom line??? If you prefer to thumb through a photo album years later, strongly consider a different camera with higher mega pixels."
3,"Good Camera, but you can get a better buy","This Sony MVC-FD73 is a really great camera. It has outstanding zoom abilities that will put you at center stage from as far as 150 ft from the stage, and while holding the camera above the crowds heads. The only draw back is, as with most digitals, recording time is slow. Be prepared to miss several shots due to slow recording time, but the upside is, you do not have to down load your pics, just change the disk and keep going. As far as the price, you can find a better deal at national retail stores and get availible warranties without the cost or bother of unpredictable shipping."
4,Very Nice Camera-Sony!,"I purchased the Sony MavicaMVC-FD73 on the 4th of July. Wonderful gift! I cannot find enough pictures to take. The zoom is awesome. the pictures print up good enough for framing. The battery life is a plus, the floppy disk is a plus. I only wish the camera were alittle smaller. I am very pleased with this camera."
5,A Recorder of Life,"This is simply a great product that never forgets what it can do best. No, it is not the best, most fully-featured digital camera on the market. But it must surely be the simplest to use, with a price-to-quality ratio that's off the scale. I had become increasingly concerned that life's everyday events were passing me by unrecorded--you know the kind of events that one might like to look back on, but that are simply not worth the hassle and expense of traditional film processing. This camera is a Recorder of Life. Light, simple, and good quality pictures. The rechargable battery lives long, and floppy discs make archiving so easy. A must-have!"
3,Purchase with care,"Do not purchase this book if you are planning on using current battery and motor technology in your aircraft.I have yet to find any battery information concerning LiPo batteries in this book. All the discussions in the book on motors are about brush type motors. Surveying local hobby shops none of them deal in brushed motors or NiCd power sources for aircraft.Other than this the book is a wealth of detail, just dated on teh technology."
2,Good in its day,"This book was a good introduction to electric r/c model airplanes when it was written. Things have changed so much so fast in electric model airplanes that the book is virtually obsolete. There are a few good ideas that still have value. Like all of Harry Higley's books it's an easy read with clear explanations. However I can only recommend it as a nostalgic view of the good old days, even if they were only 10 or 20 years ago."
2,"Thorough, but boring","Too much like reading a police report, actually a thousand police reports. See Killing Pablo if you want a good feel for how interesting this story COULD be if it was told well..."
3,Good book but full of spelling and grammatical errors,"It was refreshing to read a book on the Cali Cartel. Most books written regarding the drug cartels in Colombia focus on Medellin and/or Pablo Escobar. The only problem I found with this book was the fact that there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors. I am not sure if this was an issue the editor should have corrected, the printer, or the author himself but I found myself reading sentences that would end abruptly and several cities and persons that were misspelled. This is very unprofessional. In any case, even though the writing style is a bit ""dry"", I found myself enjoying the book simply because of its focus on the ""other"" cartel of Colombia."
2,Too many details,"This book drowns in too many details and facts, and because of that the main characters remain a bit 'without character' so to speak. If you liked Mark Bowden's 'The Hunt for Pablo', do not think that this book is from the same order. It is not. It's far, far below."
1,no title,i started reading it and it just didnt keep me interested in the story line. i got as far as the second chapter and just could not read more. i bought two other books on the same topic and i just could not put tyhem down but this one just didnt wake up interest in wanting to know whats next.
5,it might become very expensive,"Don't buy this CD, everybody coming to visit you will ask for one and you are going to spend a lot of money.Don't go to her concert you will become addicted.Now you are aware...She is outstanding"
5,bfg teflon pads,added them to both my kids mice. viper and diamondback and they tell me they fly. also mice are used on the razer aluminun exactmats. pads are suppose to prolong mouse life.
5,Carisa is an awesome teacher,"This DVD is great. I have been into sideshows and performance arts since I was a kid. I am now teaching myself *(its a no-no to teach yourself I know)* these skills. Because of this awesome DVD I was able to actually eat fire in three days. In two weeks I felt comfortable enough to perform for my friends, who were totally floored."
3,Dog Food storage,"I was desperate for a container to store dog food.I love the skinniness of this bin, but1- the scoop is too small (love that it stores in the lid)2- not quite the quality I expect from Rubbermaid3- it does not hold a whole 30 lb. bag of dog food.But it works.You can't have everything you want. or at least I can't."
2,Flimsy piece of junk,"I bought this and I gave it a 2 for ingenious design with the scooper inside the lid. However, i returned it because it is very flimsy and the plastic is real cheap. Its not typical Rubbermaid quality."
2,Sounds like you're in a cave,"I have had this phone for one month and at first it didn't bother me, but now I am tired of everyone I talk to telling me I sound like I'm very distant or in a cave. My previous experience with Panasonic cordless phones was excellent, but this one does not have the same quality as my old analog cordless phone which it replaced.Update: Just received the phone back from the ELGIN service center and it is basically the same as before. It cuts out parts of conversations intermittently. It randomly sounds good then sounds poor. Changing the channel sometimes corrects this. People on the other end of the line report clicks and hissing which I do not hear. Most conversations have to be switched to a corded phone. I think I will start over with a different phone."
4,Follow the directions on the unit (not like me),"Good user interface, very sturdy, well built. Voice quality is as good as cordless phones get, though they still are not as good as an average land line phone. The three line LCD displays complete Caller ID info without scrolling.Be Fair Warned !!We made the mistake of returning the remote unit to the base after every call, which they tell you with a big sticker, not to do until the recharge light comes on. We are now down to 10 to 15 minutes of total talk time before recharging. Don't do what we did, follow the directions and fight the urge to return the remote unit to its base after a call is completed."
3,Battery won't hold a charge,"One the unit I bought, the battery, after 1 year of light use, will not hold a charge of more than 15 minutes (supposed to be many hours)"
3,Generic anime style,"This book is a good reference for cutting edge CG methods. It has some basic drawing tips, tutorials on coloring in different programs such as Photoshop and Corel Painter (if you use any other programs than these dont bother with this book), and covers cell style shading, airbrush style, and ""digi paint"" style. The latter, airbrush and digipaint, is very vaguely covered. Most of this book is about cell style shading very generic anime style characters. And I do mean anime style, not manga style, as I think this book is mistakenly titled. It doesn't contain any information about using the computer to color in black and white manga style.If you're completely new to this type of stuff, don't get this book, it'll just overwhelm you. This is an alright book to have on the shelf for reference but it doesn't contain anything you can't get by searching on the internet for a CG tutorial in your program of preference."
3,Not for Photoshop Element Users,"I was looking for a book that would help me learn digital art with Photoshop Element 6 (the program was given to me as a gift) and thought I would give this book a try since I am serious about this particular hobby (down with Microsoft Paint!). One of the most important tools they mention (Freeform pen, which is what you use for shadowing) is not an included tool in the updated Element version! I've tried web searching to see if there was a pen tool, or how to shadow manga artwork with a different tool offered in Photoshop Element... so far I have found nothing! What a huge let down!There was nothing wrong with the book itself, but I didn't have the old Photoshop version to utilize this manual... so I wrote this review as a warning to those who have the same program as I do and are thinking about buying this book. It would be helpful if there was a manga digital art book out there that was updated and showed users how to use photoshop element program."
2,Youll need more than this book,"Its a decent book it covers basics but in a few areas it leaves out information, leaving you sort of guessing and having to experiment in order to find out how things work. Fortunately I have a Photoshop 7 book to help me out to show me how to use tools and another book to fill in the blanks. Like a lot of books now you have to buy additional material to fill in the blanks."
4,The Review of the Gods,"Phantasy Star Collection was pretty darn good, I mean, holly moly, jumpin jolleys, three games for the price of one!!! Man o man, what a bang, what a buck, what a deal!!!! I would strongly recomend buying this game. My reasons for this decisive decion are as follows: 1.good graphics (for the time it was made in)2.The learning curve is steap, but effective, meaning that once you get past the first hour, and level up a bit, no, alot, you will begin to enjoy the game.3. The game is sweet!"
5,This game is great.,"This game is a great game for fantasy and sci-fi lovers. It putsgaming to the test. It has good graphics, handling, and character design. Just play the game, you'll see!"
1,Terrible,"1 star is too much for this drivel. This is a self published book in desperate need of editing. Actually, that's an understatement. Almost every sentence is poorly written and incoherent. This author clearly has her own agenda; she wants to show she was important to Eva Gabor and promote her ideas about ""electomagnetic harrassment."" Do not purchase this title!"
1,Unscrupulous is Unreadable,"I was expecting an inside look at the life of Eva Gabor and instead what I paid for was the paranoid rantings of someone who believes she is under the influence of microwaves being beamed into herself and her pets. The publishers should be ashamed that they printed a book like this that not only is badly written and full of misspellings, but obviously not fact based or interesting. Warning!! The author intends to write two more volumes of this non edited ramblings. Not worth your money or your time."
1,Horrible!,"Eva Gabor is one of my favorite actresses. But the women who was her ""best friend"" and author of this book is CRAZY!! The book is hard to understand at times because the author has a thick mexican accent and writes just how she talks. she is trying to show that she was ""friends"" with all the celebrities. The book is supposed to be about eva gabor not ""the voices"" and the ""immortals"" that talk to the author."
1,Not up to par,This was not very interesting and not really kinky.... would not refer to anyone else. Gave it away....SNORE
5,"PLAP ( for short ) ABSOLUTELY BRASIL , a pleasure....","Pedro luis é A Parede ( PLAP ) , a composer writer singer and guitar player from the streets of Rio , with a ""can`t beleive it - percussion section"" , he has recorded 3 CD'S ,from this CD try : Miseria no Japao, ( misery in Japan ? ) , Rap , Rock absolutely from Brasil , no doubt.These guys are very creative with percussion sources , they play objects , electrodomestics whatever they feel will make the tune stronger and richer and also will take the listener by surprise.If you like creativity and innovation buy this CD , try to get the other CD'S , PLAP its new and refreshing food for your heart , mind , body ( grat for dancing too ) and soul"
4,Keeps on tickin'...,"I purchased this timepiece about three years ago, because of prior experience with another (inexpensive) solar-powered watch. Casio makes good products, and when I saw this, I decided to 'give it a go', as the Brits say!I am happy to say that it continues to keep excellent time EXCEPT when I keep it in a drawer too long (away from light). Amazingly, it knows what the correct time is, and upon charging, will adjust itself accordingly. Apparently, it has a memory which tracks the duration of crystal vibration, and applies same when there is enough energy to move the hands and to display the LEDs.It is also a sturdy watch, and can be worn at work or at play.It is an excellent value, and does a great job of keeping accurate time."
3,Carrier Airconditioning System Design Handbook,"This book is packed with materials. The only draw-back is it is in Imeprial units and old refrigerants. I like to have a newer edition than my 1965 edition, in MKS units."
3,A funny show.but....,"Good Times was a very funny show,but it's portrayal of white people was extremely racist. White people were portrayed in two ways on this show-either incompetent or corrupt. In it's entire run,there is not one episode where a white person is shown in a positive light. If anyone disagrees with this comment,then I invite them to name one episode. It's ironic that a show about the struggles of black people would turn out to have such a hypocritical attitude. What a pity that it couldn't have been more fair and balanced as it is a funny show and did have some good themes(like discouraging kids from joining gangs). Another ironic point about the show is that the two seinor leads(John Amos and Esther Rolle)both quit in a dispute over ""Mr Dynomite"" getting too big a starring role over them."
4,Good While It Lasted,"I had this player for about 2.5 years and used it exclusively in my car. I was impressed with the performance and the sound was was very good/better than most portable cd players I have used in my car. However, one day the power kept turning on and off and realized that the DC Jack in the back that connects to the lighter input was busted. Not sure how this happened! However, it still works fine as a stand-alone portable.I would reccomend this product if you have the bucks to spend and will not use it solely for car use. *sigh* I think I will just spring for an in-dash"
5,Yummy Goodness,My girlfriend had this cookbook and the pictures alone are worth the purchase. Drooling on them is optional. The recipes are exceptional!
5,Child of the 80's,"He-Man was one of my favorite cartoons growing up. And yes it's corny, yes it's predictable, but it's the same cartoon I loved when I was growing up. I remember just waiting and waiting for He-Man (Prince Adam) to hold his sword up and turn into this guy the was unstoppable. All in all, this was a purchase of the heart. I knew exactly what I was getting and it was worth it."
5,I have the Power!!!!,"Hey, what can I say? This is no better deal on this set, all of season 2, and you must have season 1 already so you know its a great show..Kids need shows like this, Good VS Evil. Conflict doesn't have to end with blood all over the place, especially not for children.This is a wonderful example of 80's toons where each episode is entertaining as well as full of moral teachings & life lessons.On a personal note, its time Adam came out of the closet. ""Pink V-Neck with purple pants"" Really??Lets get this boy some new clothes, lol..Seriously though, I give this show 5 Stars, its great family entertainment. (By the power of Greyskull!!)"
5,He-Man,Not much to sayI bought the complete collection and now I have the PowerFor true Fans onlyGet the Funko Wacky bubble Heads too
5,love it,"I use to run home from school just to watch this, by the time I got home it was over.do you have season three??"
2,Trying to be cute,A collection of stories by different authors. The central theme is 'Alternate History of Merlin'. With Merlin already a mythical latter-day addition to the already mythological Arthurian saga this one is pretty far out. What with each author trying to find a 'cute' angle it is up to the personal taste of the reader if there is something worth reading here. I am afraid that five minutes after having finished this book I do not remember anything that was in here.
5,It does the job VERY well.,"This is not only a good product for cat odors, it's also a good cleaner, so you can use it without worrying about your cat getting poisoned by an ammonia based cleaner."
2,A disappointing product - I expected better sound quality.,"Aside from being a bit uncomfortable to wear, the big disappointment is the speakers. Not much bass response. When 'Super Bass' is selected it overdrives the speakers & distorts the music at even low volumes."
2,Decent...,"While this game is definitely better than the other Motocross games from Acclaim, it still leaves a lot to be desired. The control really feels like it needs more work and I have lost a lot of races because it makes you jump automatically when you go over a little bump. It does have some fun aspects to it, but I liked the Ricky Carmichael game better."
3,Best for light workout days,"I have never done any workouts by Patricia Moreno before this one. I think the title is misleading. I was expecting a high energy calorie-burning workout. You do get a burn, but it is from the slow, precise execution of the moves, not because you get a good cardio workout. I'm an intermediate exerciser. I would recommend this for beginners who are just learning how to kickbox. The moves are done slow and really teach you good form. However, I'm only giving three stars. I'm removing one star because I think the name is misleading, and another star because there is no warm up or cool down. Now the person who designed this workout could argue that the moves are slow enough that they are the warm up and cool down, but I think it is a bad habit to get people into thinking they don't need to stretch. If I had previewed this video, I probably would not have bought it. To make use of it I'll probably do the video occasionally on light days or in combination with harder workouts."
2,"No cardio, no burn, knee pain","I had studied martial arts for many years but unfortunately let myself go physically for the last 3 years. Recently I decided to get back in shape, so I tried this DVD. Believe me I am really out of shape, but this workout did nothing for me except causing knee pain. No cardio, no burn. I'll stick to Tae Bo for now."
2,Not for beginners,"This is not for someone who is brand-new to kickboxing. She shows a move once then adds on moves and speeds it up and it is too hard to keep up. Also the camera is focused on the exercisers' faces too often and not enough on their feet so it is hard to know how the foot work is supposed to go. I must not have done it right because even though she kept saying ""you should feel it in your abs"" I didn't feel a thing. That is the area I need to work on the most. Also be warned the express workout has no warm-up. I don't know about a cool down since I didn't get that far. You should do your own warm up and stretching before and after. I didn't, and the next day I had a lot of pain and soreness in my hips, legs and knees (my left knee still hurts). Be careful."
4,A good starter video,"I actually own the ""Kickbox Yoga Fusion"" version of this DVD. I was a total newbie to kickboxing, and I've found this DVD to be really helpful in getting to know some kickboxing moves. Patricia Moreno is an encouraging teacher, and she makes the routine easy to follow. The emphasis is really on form though, so I think anyone who's very familiar with kickboxing isn't likely to benefit much from the DVD. I definitely work up a sweat doing it, but I'd have to get myself a heart rate monitor to see if it's really a high-calorie burn.One warning - do not do the ""express workout"" without warming up beforehand and stretching afterwards. You'll definitely end up sore! The longer workout has the yoga stretching moves built into it, and I've never had a problem after doing that one."
4,I speak Chinese,"I grew up watching this series, it's sequel, and prequel, and was very pleased to have found it on Amazon. It was everything I remembered as a show. I like that it has both Madarin and Cantonese dialogue. I deducted one star because of the English subtitles. I'm currently watching the series with my husband, who does not speak Chinese, and the subtitles are flashing by too fast for either him or me to read. This is an inconvenience, and as we are both speed readers, an annoyance to have to rewind several times for him to catch significant dialogue. That, and sometimes it loses something in translation, so I am hipping him up to some of the more arcane idioms. Otherwise, couldn't be happier with my purchase! :-)"
4,"Cute, nice deisgn","I just received this in the mail, and got my 4.5 year old girl to try it on. It fits her perfectly now, not sure if the size will hold until Halloween this year, but it's actually for her brother's pirate theme birthday party in a few weeks time.The material is a bit thin, and may need to be handled carefully. It looks great on her, and she loves it. She couldn't take her eyes off the mirror.Overall I think it's a good buy at a good price."
4,Lots of fun,"My twin boys, age 15 months love this toy. The music is loud but gets their attention. They love the balls bouncing around with the music. The benefit of this toy is that many other balls like nerf or ping pong type work well on it, so losing the balls is never a concern."
4,Busy toy for small toddlers,"Toy keeps small todlers busy for quite some time. Nothing to break, a little noisy is all. Great fun for kids!"
1,"Stupid, dumb , idiotic and vulgar!",This is the all-time WORST movie I've ever seen! I can'tbelieve how stupid it was! How some people think this is greatfilm is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY beyond me! It's a total snore-fest!Plus it had way too much sexual humor!Don't waste your time on this awful movie!!
1,"1/2 star, complete garbage","This film was on TV the other day and the only reason I watched it was because I was bored. My god, afterwards I felt like Id truly wasted the day and just like the film it seemed 200 years had passed. The script was flat and boring, full of misplaced jokes and inappropriate sexual innuendoes (only one joke brought a chuckle) the acting mediocre in no way moving,. As for the story itself, it was like being spoon fed a lesson in human morality and re-gurgitated SCI-Fi babble with no real depth or intellect at all.I dont know why I continued to watch the film, maybe just to see how worse it could possibly get but when it finally did (and what a predictably rubbish ending too) the only satisfaction I had was knowing I hadnt made the mistake of paying for the DVD..... even I-Robot is better than this heap"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever had to watch. It isn't even bad in a way that you can laugh at. It seems like it takes a bicentennial to watch. It is slow, boring and seems to have absolutely no point. Each stop along the way in this movie, Williams is trying to become real, and in the process finds out how to be real boring. This movie should have been 30 minutes maybe, but they decided to take that material and streatch it out for what seemed like 5 hours! I am still not sure that this movie, which takes place over 200 years was not filmed in real time, like the show '24'. Do not see this movie under any circumstances."
5,"Deeper than I expected, much better too!","I rented this DVD with the expectation that it would be the ""typical"" Robin Williams movie. I knew that the movie had been panned by some critics and did poorly at the box office, so I wasn't expecting much. Half way through the movie I actually paused it and turned to my wife and asked her: ""were the critics watching the same movie?"" This ended up being an incredibly thoughtful film, deep on many levels. In my opinion this was a film that suffered from poor marketing. The TV trailers implied a comedy, when in fact it is a thought provoking film. Transfer is excellent."
3,"Read the book, check out the movie when it's on TV","I first read ""Bicentential Man"" in college years ago and was moved by the powerful themes on what truly makes a person. The movie skirts the surface of these thoughts but doesn't get into any of the characters enough nor is the theme sufficiently developed for any emotional attachment to be drawn to it by the end of the film. Better acting than you'll find in most sci-fi movies today, however my less than positive review is definitely skewed downward because I read the book first.It's worth a look if your a fan of science fantasy."
3,"Good movie, but I expected more out of the DVD","Personally I like my DVD's to have a bit more bonus features than this one had, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I saw it when it was first released in the theaters, however, and I could have sworn that the cut of the film that I saw there was longer. I don't know if I've been ripped off or if I am imagining things, but if you watch the supplemental featurette on this DVD it appears that it has a couple of brief scenes that are not in the actual film itself. If anyone else noticed this or has any info, feel free to drop me a line at glonth@aol.com."
3,Good Night Little Miss,"Movie Summary: The Martins buy a robot and name him Andrew. Andrew turns out to be very special. He strives over the course of 200 years to find out who he is. What he finds is that more than anything, he wants to be human.My Opinion: This was a really nice story. The problem I had was that it was a lot more fun when Andrew looked like a robot. Once he turned into Robin Williams, I couldn't buy him as a Robot anymore. He didn't walk, talk, or act like a robot anymore. Now maybe that was the point, but it didn't work for me.DVD Quality: Great picture and sound. Extras include trailer and making of documentary. It's anamorphic which is near and dear to the hearts of all 16:9 TV or monitor owners out there.What You Should Do: Rent it. I really can't see this one appealing to either SciFi fans or Robin Williams fans enough for them to buy it without seeing it first. It is a nice family movie. Nothing too offensive or vulgar."
5,Bicentennial Man review,"I saw this movie so many years ago. My husband hasn't seen the movie so we decided to buy a copy of it. We drove around town to different video stores but couldn't find it. I went online and purchased it on Amazon.com; dvd plus shipping only cost me over $8. My husband played the movie one night, and to my surprise he liked it very much! He didn't expect that this movie would entertain him. I couldn't believe when he said that this is so far the most entertaining movie we've watched together- next to Planet of the Apes! I recommend this movie. It is very wholesome and it touches your heart...it was worth more than $8!"
5,Robin Williams is wonderful in this role.,"Robin Williams was absolutely wonderful in this role. He was both sensitive and charming as the robot Andrew. His portrayal makes you believe that if one truly wanted to become the best human that you can possibly be, then one should be able to accomplish this. This portrayal is one of Issac Asimov's best of the robot short stories. Highly recommended."
4,Not just a children's movie.,"Bicentennial Man"" was advertised as a childrens' movie when it first came out in the theaters, but it is so much more than that. The movie tells about a robot, played by Robin Williams, and his quest (which takes over 200 years) to become human.I knew the movie would be more than giggles and special effects. The movie was, in my opinion, quite well done. What looks like a comedy at first ends up being a layered look at the human race. Robin Williams is surprisingly sedate and his romance between him and the daughter of his first love is touchingly sweet.""Bicentennial Man"" is at both times uplifting and saddening. It is a great family movie, although some of the deeper meanings in the movie might be over the heads of younger children, they will still be entertained by the movie (and the token ""booger"" jokes thrown in for that purpose). And if you really want to enjoy the movie with your family, watch it and then read the novella and compare!"
4,"Good film, a little depressing","Did not do well at box office, probably because movie tended to be depressing. They were jumping so many yrs, was hard to tell women apart at times. Film was a hybrid comedy/drama -but the science part(one man in a lab doing all that)- when they made him human was absurd, considering their apparent lack of progress in expanding human life span. Plus they suggested these droids had been phased out, w.o. mentioning probable similar, yet more advanced droids that would have been produced by other companies.Williams did a good job, and probably a difficult task for the screenwriters to even make this film as good as it was.Movie does present many interesting thought provoking topics, no question."
5,Robin William's most poingant film,"This film is fun and quirky while it addresses the basic human desires of knowing oneself, making one's life into something worthwhile, prejudice and freedom. This film captures imagination and adresses old thoughts in a new and fresh way. Thoroughly enjoyable."
5,I just discovered this lovely film!,"In gathering information to update my science fiction book list, I found that this movie was based on Isaac Asimov's novella by the same name (which became a full novel called The Positronic Man). Having read more than 20 SF books by Asimov, I couldn't believe I missed this.I was enthralled from beginning to end: marvelous production, tremendously talented cast, and such a beautiful score by James Horner (which rivals -- to my mind -- his soundtracks for Aliens, Titanic, and Avatar). Needless to say, I now have the soundtrack CD as a companion to the DVD. Chris Columbus directed with a gentle, yet powerful touch and drew me along emotionally at every turn.I strongly recommend this glorious, heart-warming film; and you don't need to be a Science Fiction fan to appreciate it!"
4,"Touching, Entertaining Movie","I thought Bicentennial Man was a very touching story. At times it was a bit lame, but overall it was a good movie. Some of the visuals were just great, particularly the ones of the distant future. I thought a lot of the talent in the movie was miss used. Robin Williams doesn't really seem like a robot to me, I think someone would have been better off playing that role. Also, on the DVD there really werent any note worthy extras, just a trailer and a five minute promotional snipet. Common, this is dvd, we want more."
5,Outstandng movie - A must see for all ages,"Bicentennial Man is the exploration of the the human spirit. The drive to survive and to be accepted. This movie touches on love, romance, comedy, prejudices and equality for all. Robin Williams and Elsbeth Davidtz were exceptional. The sounds track by Jmes Horner was haunting and enchanting. The Theme so by Celine Dion is breathtaking. A movie I can gladly say is the best that I have every seen. The movie does not focus on futuristic gadets and what not. The focus of the movie is change evelution and love. Something that everyone can relate to."
3,It could have been better,"Bicentennial Man was one of the most lasckluster robot tales Isaac Azimov ever wrote and it's no wonder it ended up as another unimaginative Hollywood BLAH; nothing on par with his overall robot series. The movie starts nice and has some few great moments, as when the robot starts his pilgrimage to find others of his kind (and in Frisco he meets that smart-mouther female version; I laughed out loud at the way she danced... the last pleasant surprise the film had in store for me). After that, it just spirales downward and the movie becomes a general letdown."
5,Glad to have it!,"Haven't had opportunity to actually view this DVD yet (still working on the others I bought at the same time!), but this one came still wrapped, and the disc was virgin-new when I opened the box. Was delivered quickly, and I am loking forward to enjoying this most excellent movie soon!"
4,Bicentennial Man,"At what point in time does man become his own creator. Interesting movie. The concept of the movie isn't so far into the future that we, as a society, shouldn't start considering artificial intelegence won't happen. It will, then how would it be delt with."
1,It seemed like 200 years...,"Typical of Robin Williams' ""New Age"" drivel that he's been making lately. Where is the actor of ""Dead Poet's Society,"" ""Good Will Hunting,"" and ""Good Morning, Vietnam""? This film is TERRIBLE! Not is it only overlong (it seemed like 200 years), but the character development is nearly nonexistent and the themes overstated and underdeveloped. A clunker. Some nice set design, though."
1,Stinks!,"The story stars Robin Williams as a robot trying to learn to become human. We've come a long a way since 'Mork & Mindy'. The more things change....Anyway, the acting is terrible, and Williams, true to form stuffs more schmaltzy feel-good warm fuzzies down our throat than you can believe. Totally predictable, totally puerile. Even Sam Neil can't save this one."
1,Should Be A Zero,"I spent the beginning of this movie waiting outside the theater for the flea, and boy am I glad that I did. Afterward I was really glad to have missed any of this tedious, endless mess. Easily the worst movie I've seen this year, it made BATS seem witty by comparison. Trite, trifling and dull, this movie is simply syrupy sentimentality at it's worst. OH! To be human! Even Star Trek The Next Generation did this shtick better. Could these really be based on Asimov? tMoby fell asleep, I only wish I could've. Sheer torture, by the end you'll be praying for Robin Williams's death, or maybe for your own."
1,I don't recommend this movie,"I thought this was going to be a good movie when I first saw coming attractions, but it was not good. This movie is NOT a comedy it's a family comedy for maybe the first 45 minutes, if that. For the rest it is a very very very utterly very sad drama.Bicentennial means 200 Years. He literally lives for 200 years. He's staying alive while he sees everyone he knows and loves die. It's horrible. It's the kind of movie that ruins your day in my opinion. Don't watch it if your in a good mood. But I guess if your sad while your watching it, it'll make you feel worse.The one good thing in the movie is the adorable Hallie Eisenberg (Paulie, Pepsi) who plays the younger ""Little Miss"".Well, for some reason other people who have written reviews seem to like it, I guess it's a matter of interpretation. Maybe watch it and see for yourself."
1,Distrubing!,"I have always hated the concept of machine taking over man. In this movie Machine tries to marry human? I thought that they would have created a female robot for William? I had nightmares about the concept of robot marrying human afterwards. When they finally grant him ""Human Citizenship"" I was a little freaked out."
2,Touching and warm family drama,"Another of those films that is too long at 2-1/2 hours but which is warm and touching. It's a variation on the PINOCCHIO story with a futuristic robot yearning to become human and who succeeds in that endeavor only to see those he loves die from generation to generation. It's a treatise on what it is to be human and how love actually works and is rather a lovely little film. If it could have been edited down to even a two hour running time it might have worked better. The Academy Oscar nommed it for Make-up but it also deserved nods for Costume Design, Sound Effects and Score - all quite exceptional. A nice movie for the whole family."
1,BOO HISS! WILL NOT KEEP YOUR KIDS INTERESTED!!!,"This movie was a TOTAL drag! It will not keep your kids interested at all! The story line was much to involved, and even I had a hard time staying awake for the whole movie. It is very depressing. If you have kids that are under 13, don't buy this movie, and expect them to hang around the popcorn. Eventhough there is a ""moral"" to the story, kids will not wait around for the whole movie to ""get it"". Do not recommend this movie for anyone under 20, and even us oldtimers thought it was too heavy. I walked away from seeing this with a ""wasted my money"" feeling."
1,Hmmm...,"I saw this with such high hopes that Robin williams would do a good job. He tries to rescue this film from utter suckiness, but it just isn't enough. The first half hour is good, as Robin Williams is a robot who was just bought by a family to do various house hold projects. It's funny, and he has some questions about life that make you think. It goes DOWN from there. Time keeps passing so quickly, you don't know what's going on. Half way through the movie, there is a girl robot who is mind numbingly annoying. Everyone in the theatre was moaning with the stupid things she said, trying to be funny. People were laughing because it was so bad. An ancestor of the family who bought the robot ends up having sex with him, and then it just gets stupid. I won't say anymore, except that I don't know anyone who likes this movie."
4,"Good movie, but DVD has few amenities","The movie is very good, and I enjoy it very much. Unfortunately, when they put this DVD together they didn't include any deleted scenes. The movie's theatrical trailer and a short featurette are included. If you watch the movie first, then watch the trailer you will be able to see which scenes got left on the cutting room floor. Obviously, the movie could have been much longer, and I understand the need to make it work within a ""reasonable"" time, but it is to Chris Columbus' detriment that we don't get to see what those scenes may have been..."
3,Good Movie But disappointing DVD,Bicentennial Man is a good movie but where are the extras fot the DVD? Not even a trailer? This Robin Williams movie deserves better and DVD buyers deserve more for their money.
4,Bicentennial Man,I don't normally like science fiction but I liked this because it makes you think about what it is to be fully human and what a gift freedom is.
5,Fun for family,My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's a good movie for all ages. My Grandchildren and I have watched it time and time again. Spectacular performance by Robin Williams and cast. Lots of laughts.
5,Bicentennial Man,This movie is fantastic and under rated.You have to be pretty open minded about this movie as it discusses everything from existentialism to the definition of being human.Definitely one of my favorites.
5,Review by Bernie P. Nelson,"Would you enjoy taking a sensual, magical journey through the color spectrum?The story is about the Crystal Goddess opening new vibrational levels of consciousness for Karina. Guided by her pagan mother, Karina learns of a new reality within each color. She dreams and her awareness is stretched and circled as she seeks the prize at journey's end within the rainbow.It is an exciting work, integrating enlightened poetry, and much more than fantasy fiction. Rainbow Goddess dives into the dangerous but rewarding worlds of soul and physical interaction. The book provies deep insight into the true reality of Self. And the reader can learn about and experience a metaphysical and physical facet for each color-even black and white."
4,Movie / Play,Very interesting movie that has a theater play like features. It is done with a slow pace. No real violence and only one quick nude shot (which was done very nicely). Has a good main lesson in life.
2,a waste of time,"I do not care for Nick Notle, and this movie is not recommended. John Goodman appears as an opertive for a government agency. His performance is fair."
5,Better with each watching.,"The first time I watched this film I liked it. The second time I loved it. The third time I worshipped it. The characters grow on me more each time - I could spend two hours just watching Alan Arkin and Nick Nolte talking about nothing over a bottle of wine.I'm a Vonneut fan, and this is the only film to capture not just his wit and plot but the wonderful, wonderful characters he creates."
5,"A Terrific Movie, very close to the book","I first saw this movie while browsing through the movie channels. It is now one of my favorites. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee, John Goodman, and Alan Arkin all put in terrific performances. This movie, like most based on Vonnegut novels, is filled with drama, dark humor, suspense, and mystery. I highly recommend this film. It has terrific acting, an excellent plot, and its just a darn good film. I also recommend the book of the same name by Vonnegut. The film's plot stays very close to the book so if you like the movie you'll like the book or vice versa."
4,Very underrated,"The original Castlevania 64 was under par, not just because of the twitchy camera or the graphics but because of the short length of the game. The ""Legacy of Darkness"" expansion brought two new characters including the one I thought was strongest and most well-rounded, Carrie. I enjoy her stages the most.The graphics look extremely dated and they weren't the best even when the game came out, but I don't think they take much from the gaming experience. My biggest gripe was the difficult controls, which made jumps difficult, and the camera wasn't the best, but most games have a camera problem.There isn't all that much of a story to speak of, it's mostly straight adventuring, which is what I want out of a game. It's colorful and has a lot of action, and in general it's engaging fun, although not that deep. I'd recommend it."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"By far Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness is a better game than Castlevania 64, however, it is not as good as others say. As a long time fan of the Castlevania series, I purchased this game thinking of how kewl it would be to play as a werewolf, boy was i mistaken. Turning into a werewolf saps the amount of jewels you've collected and once you turn into a werewolf you can't change back until all your jewels are gone. Not only that but there really isn't a difference between turning into a werewolf and staying human. I beat Dracula without even transforming! i would suggest getting this game if you haven't purchased Castlevania 64, which is a horrid addition to the Castlevania series and if you already own an N64. However, if you don't own an N64, don't buy one to play this game, it isn't worth it. Get Game boy advanced and get castlevania circle of the moon or harmony of dissidence"
4,The way last year's Castlevania release should have been...,"Castlevania Legacy of Darkness goes back to its roots and borrows the best from earlier games on the original Nintendo platform. True Castlevania fans can draw on their experiences from the previous games such as Castlevania III on the original Nintendo system. The camera angles have been corrected from the Castlevania release from last year - a much needed improvement. The player can choose different characters after defeating Dracula. Although many of the areas appear the same, many differences and enhancements give the game a better feel. Overall, this is the way the game should have been last year! It's great!"
3,OK,This game was o.k. but still not the best compared to the rest. The graphics were better but no one had any cool costumes and you had to waste time getting all the stuff you needed (which took forever) to get to the next level i'd give this game 3 stars.
4,This game is a must for ALL adventure/platform gamers,"This game is one of the toughest, coolest games on the market! Cornell is a real hero, like the Belmonts of the previous CastleVania games. The addition of Henry, Carrie Fernandez, and Reinhardt Scnider made this game almost perfect. The targeting needs some work, and Cornell's wolf form needs the ability to transform back into human form, but otherwise, this game was awesome!"
4,Compassionate analysis,"Although this book was evidently written by whites for whites, as an African-American woman I was compelled to buy the book because I too want an understanding of the how and the why of the often inability of whites to fully grasp the presence and effect of ingrained white supremacy in our country. I love my White brothers and sisters and this book seems to be a helpful bridge to understanding the still deep woundednes many Blacks feel over not only past but current socialized behaviors suffered at the hands of often unknowing Whites. It also gives me more compassion and understanding of the issues Whites must deal with in dealing with and understanding their fellow African-Americans. Let this book be a source of healing for us all. God Bless."
5,An education in itself,"I have a fairly minimal background in graphic design, except for a two week class I took when I was 12 (I'm 24 now). Other than that, I'm just computer literate and I learn things quickly. This book gave me a wealth of knowledge in an easy to digest form- Running into terms in your Adobe help files that you don't recognize? Get out the lexicon. Talking to a printer and you don't want to sound like an idiot? Get out the lexicon. Everyone from beginners to pros should have this book. The definitions are simple but precise, with examples of the more difficult terms to make them easier to understand. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars."
4,Disco Inferno a Must for Disco fans,"Any fan of Disco must own this album, featuring the 11-minute version of ""Disco Inferno"". ""Body Contact Contract"" is also a great extended-play track that never really made it to the clubs. I highly recommend this album."
5,Stepping back in time,"This is a good album that captures the tune of the times. Of course, everyone knows Disco Inferno, yet there are other tunes here that will take you back in the day. This showcases the Tramps that their best."
4,Not too bad for the price and for being electric,"Keeping it short and simple:For a townhouse-sized lot, this electric mower will get the job done no problem. I see no difference in performance between this and a gas mower. Much quieter and you don't have to worry about gas and oil. Starts up quicker than a car. Kind of hard to get used to managing the cord, but if you have a small sized lot, it's worth the inconvenience."
3,Disapointed,It fit perfectly in my sink and it was very nice. It cleans good. Than I had pasta with red sauce and now it is all stained red. It will not come off.
2,Not a visible warning,"Yes, the mat is solid and the most discreet you can expect.Yet I wish the seller or Amazon had written somewhere that the product is made of a plastic banned in the state of California because it contains a substance that causes cancer... It's not because you order from elsewhere that the risk should not be mentioned. So you discover on the product that is potentially life threatening..."
3,Discolors with age,"This sink mat grows brittle and turns grey on edges with age. I've had it for 2-3 years and clean it often with dishsoap and sponge. I wish they sold it in colors, the greying might not be so noticeable. The good thing with clear is seeing through it to keep food debris washed away."
1,Insanity!,"I could not agree more that this is ""shrill, unconvincing screed."" I might also add that for a Professor who teaches psychoanalytic theory, Ms. Gallop doesn't seem to have a clue about the mechanisms of DENIAL, RATIONALIZATION and NEGATION. The unconscious is speaking very clearly through all this nonsense, if anyone cares to find it where it is, all on the surface. My condolences go out to her poor students, past and present, who have to put up with this psychotic pretentiousness."
1,nauseating,"For decades, many male professors have made the same excuses for sexual exploitation of their students--to the fury of feminists. To read a feminist using the same rationalizations is both nauseating and infuriating."
4,Works,"This was recommended to me by a friend who worked at a health food store for years. Apparently several customers reported that they had good luck with it. I tried it, along with upping my fitness regiment, and sure enough my cholesterol levels dropped significantly. It's got a lot of Niacin which causes flushing, especially on an empty stomach, but also has oat bran & fiber, grapefruit pectin, Psylium seed husk, Lecithin (w/ 24% phosphatidyl choline whatever that is), Alfalfa seed, beta-Sitosterol and L-Arginine (as L-arginine HCI), along with some other more well known supplements found in multi-vitamins. This along with exercise, is a good alternative to pharmaceutical drugs which may pose health hazards."
5,Centric Parts Clutch Slave Cylinder,This Central Parts 138.44407 Clutch Slave Cylinder was purchased thru Amazon.com. Was installed by a professional mechanic. After more than two years still works fine. Meets expectations.
5,Grape Fruit Snacks,"Grape Fruit Snacks are the best snack from Welch! I cannot find these, so where can I get these? Please send me where to buy. candybieber@ yahoo.com"
5,Sanity saver,"I tried every tuning trick in the book attempting to get the 16x16 bass that came with my Groove Percussion Travel Kit (ASIN B0006JKC3U) to sound right.Square bass drums (same diameter and depth) are notoriously difficult to tune, and no matter which tension setting I used, or what I stuffed inside to dampen the ring and overtones without choking the warmth I was seeking, I just cound not get there until I purchased this ingenious pad.Careful placement using the multiple gate design of 'pillows' brought about a magic transformation from a cantankerous bass drum that seemed to have its own ideas about sound, to a sweet, warm sounding bass that does what I want it to do."
2,UK number 1s... I guess,"A made in the UK music CD I could of easily lived without. Sound quality is average at best of songs I've heard way to many times with a few exception.There are two song from Petula Clark's catalog that didn't hit big in the USA (Sailor, This is my song). Anything by either Chris Farlowe or Long John Baldry is bad news for me. And I can barely understand a word spoken or sang by a Lonnie Donegan character.Current price for this low rent/budget collection is also way to high.For me this was/is a waste of time and resources."
3,Okay,"The top of the tape, the movable piece on the top, was broken off. Pretty shabby. However, the tape still worked fine even with it off"
3,not bad but not good either,this ppv could have used a lot of work the first match val venis vs. steve blackman was boring. dlo vs. mark henery was averagely okay. chyna vs. jeff jarret was ok. outlaws vs.edge and christian was a snooze. al snow vs. bossman was alright. x-pac and jericho was ok. and the 6 pac challenge was the best match on the card but save your money dont buy it just rent it.
1,WWF UNFORGIVEN,"This PPv is easily the worst PPV in WWF in 1999. All the matches were 1-star, apart from the 6-pack match which might JUST deserve a 2-star, and the Kennel from Hell match, which gets 0 stars, being the worst wrestling match I have EVER seen.DO NOT get this tape, instead buy a good PPv, like Royal Rumble 2000, or No way Out."
2,WWF did a bad job for this years unforgiven,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PAY PER VIEW'S I EVER SEEN IN A WHILE THE ONLY GOOD MATCHES THAT WERE GOOD WAS THE SIX PACK CHALLENGE AND X-pac VS Y2J LAST YEARS UNFORGIVEN WAS TIGHT I'M GOIN TO NO MERCY ON THE 17TH OF OCTOBER IN CLEVELAND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE A GOOD SHOW I HOPE
2,ghost of zorro,This tape version is poor;plot line rambles and with all the editing its hard to follow. i've tried watching it several times and have gotten disgusted with it each time. Clayton Moore is creditable in his role and it was nice to see him in something other than the Lone Ranger. If you really want to enjoy this story try to find a copy of the whole serial. You won't be disappointed there.
2,Bad Sound,"I remember this movie when it was a serial and it was pretty good. This cut down version has a lot to be desired, because of the hatchet editing. The biggest complaint I have is the HORRIBLE sound quality! Maybe it is just my copy, but the sound is like listening through an early Edison protoype!"
5,this was exally what i was looking for.,"i like this movie very much it was hard to find,is there anyway you can put this on dvd.and also can you find 1. the kid from broken gun 1952,it stars charles starrett and also 2. bandits of el dorado 1949,it also stars charles starrett,these movies are hard to find.,i would like them on dvd,if you have them."
3,Zorro in Missouri?,"Both the Ghost and the Son of Zorro come on with promising,dashing Spanish sword fight music, then reduce themsleves to standard Republic westerns filmed at the same old location near Ventura County. Zorro belongs in Mexico like the silver saddle on his horse, and should sound like a Spaniard speaking English. Village blacksmith makes a good bad guy and the sign over his shop is actually funny. This serial would have been better without trying to make hay with the name of Zorro."
2,Nice graphics but rubbish AI,"The graphics are nice on this game but the AI is awful. The poker games are really easy to beat. It doesn't have an online feature, so are stuck playing the rotten AI. The slots are OK for about 10 mins"
5,best ps2 card game available at this time,i got this and the championship poker for my b-day i wanted the texas holdem game on them this is beter than the championship the characters are more animated not as detailed as championship but much more enjoyable
5,Sweet game! Just what I've been looking for,"I just got this game yesterday and I love it! You can create your own character, walk around in a 3D casino, and work on becoming a ""High Roller"". Basically, the higher your bankroll is, the more stuff you begin to unlock (different casino games, clothing outfits, ect), and the higher priced games you have access to. The tournaments are fun and the AI is good. I admit I am no pro, but I have been getting spanked in a handful of the 7 card stud, 5 card stud, Texas Hold'em, ect poker games.One thing to take note. The character's personality is associated with what head you choose. Experiment with 20 or so different heads before you go full steam into building your char. You don't want to get stuck with a goofy looking head that ends up being a flaimer..."
4,"A great game for ""casino"" realism","Excellent game, realistically puts you on the floor of the casino. Popular card games, slots and table games. It may take some time to navigate, but fun to play, keeps you entertained for hours!! Shipped from CA and arrived in Ohio just two days later....appreciate that, the first seller claimed ""shipment"" and I'm still waiting for it a month later. Highly recommend ""Fast and Simple"" for purchase/quality expectations!!"
1,Didn't work,"This lint brush did not work on anything I tried it on. I tried it on a coat, my couch, and a blanket. I used regular lint rollers on the coat and they had worked great, but this thing just moves the lint and fur around on the service and didn't pick up even a little bit of it."
2,A Joke,I give this lint brush a 1 or a 2 because it does pull lint off of your clothing. The self-cleaning aspect of it is a joke though. You'd be better off going to Target and getting a regular lint brush.
1,piece of junk,This $11.99 lint brush is a junky piece of plastic. The handle broke in half after 3 uses. Would not recommend!!
2,Not durable,"I bought this unit and almost immediately the glued-on lint-removing fabric started to come unglued. I glued it back on, and it stayed reasonably adhered. Now the rotating mechanism has broken. This brush worked fine while it stayed in one piece. Unfortunately, that was not very long."
1,UGH!,"I found this video to be dry and therefore, I got very turned off. She is not talking when she is doing it and this does not make me feel enthusiastic. There is no technique. Her moves are fast but rather stiff. She has very bad form! She does not always do the same reps. The way that she does it, people can get hurt. Save your money!"
1,Shouldn't have wasted my money,"I realized within 10 minutes of watching just one of the tapes, that I would never do the workout and wished I could return it. It wasn't just the bad set and lighting and bad choice of outfitting. Mostly it was slow slow slow and not good for beginners slow, I mean you could do the workout while cooking or carrying on an involved conversation and still be bored..."
1,Really Bad,"I am not an advanced kickboxing expert, but I know enough to realize this person has little to no knowledge of kickboxing principles or techniques. She is very clumsy in her moves, and does not use proper technique. I noticed at the beginning of the video, she was speaking during the movements and became short of breath after just a couple of minutes. The video then changed to a recording of her voice while she performed the exercise. I wonder how conditioned she actually is for this type of workout or if she is even experienced at all in kickboxing. Just look at the back of the video package. She is posed in an uppercut with her fist turned in....a good way to break a wrist!The video package says she is a ""renowed kickboxing trainer with ten years experience in designing workouts"", but gives no proof or additional information of this. I would like some further information on her credentials."
3,A Well Rounded Workout,"First off I'd like to say that I really did enjoy the video. However, my only complaints on it would be that Stephanie isn't one of the most charismatic instructors out there. On the other hand, Stephanie is a good instructor and does the moves at a high level of expertise. I have gotten others tapes with instructors that really cant throw a good jab or do a good roundhouse kick correctly. I know lots of people like the hyped up energy that some instructors do and I do admit that it helps motivate you into doing the program. In short all I can really say is that she may not be the most motivating person, I can and do appreciate a good workout that this tape does provide. Furthermore, I did like the two tapes and I switch back and forth depending on my moods."
1,What a waste of money!,"These videos are awful! I have bought bad ones before, but this set stands out as the most boring I've ever seen. Really, I never even tried to do the workouts; I fell asleep while previewing the set after my purchase. I actually watched the first tape and most of the second one. Both were really bad. I only wish I could get my money back from the store where I bought them. I plan to donate my copy to the local charity thrift store. I hope they can make a few bucks from it, but I feel sorry for the hopeful soul who buys it."
1,Heinous.,"I bought this video years ago, to test the kickboxing waters, so to speak. I cannot believe this thing is still in print. Complete waste of money. Try any other kickboxing workout, please. There are so many out there now."
5,Concise and Lucid. A must for Bronica aficionados.,"Mr. Beard does an excellent job of presenting the entire line of Bronica Cameras, and chronicles the history of roll film cameras in general from past to present. Little known historical facts, such as the origin of the name ""Broncia"" are one of the many interesting facets of this technical, but easy to read book. He details the history and full specifications of the excellent Zenzanon lenses, including those for the ETRSi, SQ-Ai, and GS-1. Every accessory is reviewed and explained in great detail, with photographs, and tips for getting the most out of your equipment. If you own or plan to buy a Bronica Camera, this book is a bargain at it's cover price. I'd recommend buying it for students of photographic history as well."
4,good old Grand Funk,I love this record i have had this record in many years and love it.I was happy to find it in CD. It's like old memory's comes back again.Thanks AmazonKurt Nielsen
2,Mediocre album,"Title track is pretty good, the weak ballads are always on the radio. They really lost it after Locomotion. The bodybuilder on the right, under the sticker is Ah-nold the Governor of California."
4,I am happy ...,I am happy with what I am getting from the 35mm Slide Scans. The two types of software need to be updated. I want to let everyone know you may not be able to have your flatbed scanner or camera connected to the computer when you use this product. Trial and error and tech support .. Otherwise for the price I am getting wonderful 35mm Slide scans from this product.
4,Does not work properly with Vista as of 4-1-07,It actually performs very good scans but it does not work properly with Vista. It needs to constantly warmed up rather than warming up once during a session.
1,very bad experience,"I bought this pendrive and when it arrived to me, I realized that it didn't worked properlySome days later, I received an email explaining that some pendrives were failed, and they will change them. Unfortunately, I live in Argentina, someone else brought to me, so I couldn't travel to U.S just to change a pendrive."
4,Satisfied,I bought this USB flash drive and it came in the time agreed. I have used it and works fine. It gives more than what it costs. Cheap device. I regret not having bought more.
4,A unique work of beauty,"It would seem that a CD that covers such a broad range would feel disconnected, but that's not the case at all. Nash and his band go from modern compositions with a string quartet to straight-ahead jazz that moves to the outside. Perhaps Nash's best, and certainly worth listening to."
4,Great writing and great playing...,"I have admired Ted Nash for several years for his work with Lincoln Center Jazz. Here, he proves to be a composer of note. Strings and jazz band blend beautifully. Ted plays with beautiful tone throughout -- although I miss the alto playing. I look forward to more work from Mr. Nash. I give it four stars simply because five must be reserved for recordings such as Far East Suite, Kind of Blue, etc."
5,Crowley's adaptation of the Taoist classic,"For any student of Thelema, this is A. Crowley's adaptation of the Tao Te Ching. It is notable particularly in the Thelemic slant in the translation/interpretation. I found it particularly interesting when compared to more literal translations; this was especially illuminating with regards to understanding Thelema."
2,"Less info than Baby & Child Care (same author), same price","""Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care"" is the only Dr. Spock book you need. ""Baby Basics"" and ""First 2 years"" are excerpts of ""Baby and Child Care"" without any useful additional information. All three books are priced about the same. I recommend T. Berry Brazelton's ""Irreducible Needs of Children"" as a more direct ""how to"" guide for interacting with your child."
1,Imagine,"Imagine, if you will, a book about serial murders in an early Native American culture in the very remote past. About such a culture, our knowledge is necessarily limited so some speculation is in order. Now imagine that you're listening to a wise man of that culture dispensing the wisdom of his many years. O.k. so far. Now imagine that the wise man expresses opinions that might easily have come from the mouth of a dippy, unlicensed, untrained mid-1980's California therapist - the kind who succumbed to and foisted onto their patients an unwavering belief in every goofy fad from alien abductions to crystal therapy to satanic ritual abuse. If that sounds plausible to you, you might like this book. Give it a try. ;)"
3,"Interesting, but not their best work","I have read, and greatly enjoyed, 17 books coauthored by the Gears. This is the first one I've been disappointed in. In many ways the writing was amateurish and some of the descriptions of people's appearances were just plain weird. I like the Gears' method of jumping back and forth between the time periods, but the present day situation read like a bad romance novel. But what bothered me most of all, after sticking with it to the bitter end, was I didn't really understand the ending! Some other reviewers made comments about the ending leaving them hanging or confused, but I just don't get it. Maybe I got impatient during the last few chapters, read too quickly and missed an important clue, but I've gone back and looked and can't quite figure it out. ???"
2,Doesn't deliver,"I finished this book debating at times if I wanted to continue. Since I was on a trip thought New Mexico I continued. It was an interesting premise which didn't deliver. I was weary of hearing about the shape of the women's faces (triangular and oval) with large doe eyes, and the many paragraphs about what the archeologists were wearing, ""a white t-shirt with khaki shorts and hiking boots"" etc. Who cares? What else would they wear to dig in a ruin? Donna Karen! I find Hellerman's mysteries involving Chee and Leaphorn much more satisfactory."
1,Researched on Wikipedia,"I would question whether the authors actually know any Native Americans personally. The tone is so weird, the historical portions read like Star Trek fan-fiction, the modern portions are just a mess (ex. I would be surprised if the authors could find Crownpoint on a map, never mind that there has been a Bashas in Crownpoint for many years prior to this book.)I really doubt that the authors: visited Chaco Canyon more than once, could name more than two federally recognized tribes, have ever seen an active archeological site in New Mexico or visited a modern Pueblo.If there was an award for working ""turkey feather capes"" into piece of fiction, then this book would win, but overall it is garbage."
4,A diversion from the past,"The writing style of The Visitant is a diversion from previous books by the Gears, although a very pleasant diversion. Prior books have been introduced with a contemporary archeological find and then the story of that prehistory character is developed. In this first of three novels the reader has the opportunity to keep pace with the current day characters as they ""dig into"" the story behind their find. This enables the reader to feel more a part of that story. As with all books by the Gears, however, it would be helpful to have a list of the main characters names, and perhaps relationships, provided along with the site maps-just to help keep the players straight. This is an interesting twist on the solving of a murder mystery in times before modern forensics."
1,A Go Nowhere Anasazi Murder Mystery,"Never have I expected more, only to get much less than I expected. This book is supposed to be a murder mystery set in the Anasazi times of Chaco Canyon. Instead it becomes a burdening plot (if you can call it a plot), unbelieveable, and then leaves with no conclusion. They just want you to buy the next book so they can continue their boring story. Don't waste your money on this book like I did. If this book is really about the Anasazi, no wonder they disappeared, they were too embarrassed knowing this book would be written about them."
5,strong from start to finish,The heart and soul of these songs blend perfectly with the spirit of the movie! Vince's story is inspirational and this music was terrific.
4,INVINCIBLE CD..GRAET SONGS FROM THE 70'S,LOVE ALL THESE OLD SONGS !! REMINDS ME OF MY HIGH SCHOOL DAYS ! WOULD RECOMEND TO ANY ONE. THE MOVIE IS GREAT ALSO.
3,Invincible Sound track,I believe there are a few songs from the movie that are not on this cd. Would have liked to have them all but still a good variety.
3,Almost worth it for How Long,"How Long is a great song. 5 stars easy. The only legal way to download it is on this soundtrack. Almost worth it. I give 4 stars to the Jim Croce song and three to canned heat, dobie grey, elvin and rod stewart (One of his best). My wife likes this Lee Michaels song, I don't. The other 6 do nothing for me, there is no place for them on my iPod. I would pay for the whole soundtrack again to get How Long plus a good Jim Croce song and 4 decent songs."
1,Worthless,"This book is absolutely worthless for passing the exam, teaching, or learning networking in general. Amazon needs a -5 Star rating for this book. There are numerous typos, information that was not researched and very wrong, multiple concepts thrown out in the same paragraph that have nothing to do with each other, and topics and information that are beyond the scope of the test and most beginning students. Save your money and buy the New Riders book."
1,SKIP THIS BOOK,"This was a pitiful excuse for a textbook. So many typos in the first two chapters I seriously doubted the validity of anything in this book. Text obviously cut and pasted but never read. Chapters disagree with one another. Acronyms constantly misspelled, wrong photos for captions. Meaningless diagrams and third grade sketches plagerized from the cbt systems CD rom (included) and farsically photocopied in stunning shades of gray and darker gray. The CD rom (yawn) was suitable for my 9 year old. If you have a competitor who is taking the Networking Essentials test, give him this book, better yet, give him mine."
1,Very basic and not worth the money I paid for it.,Was disapointed with the basic structure of a book that was labled as intermediate to advanced level. would not recomend it to anyone with basic knowledge.
1,Wait for the next edition!!!,"This book had so many typos and grammatical errors I returned it and complained directly to the publisher. Some of the mistakes were so egregious, they actually affected the content. Clearly it was rushed into print, and it is doubtful it was either properly edited or proofread. I thought I was doing myself a favor by getting a shorter volume, but in fact there are much better study guides available that cover the material in more depth, and in a better sequence. If you are new or relatively inexperienced, go for something else, e.g. the Sybex series."
2,Sheen Gem does not shine,"Bishop Sheen was a thinking man's thinking man. I only wish more people today thought as he thought and would speak out as he spoke out. No greater gift could be given a teenager or adult than a compilation of the best (and often funniest) Sheen had to offer. Sadly, this is not the case here. Instead, the viewer is presented tantalizing snippets of Bishop Sheen's brilliance, but just as the viewer is drawn into his story, the scene is harshly cut to an unrelated episode. And so it continues endlessly throughout this video, jumping from one clip to another. In the end I found my myself worrying more about when the cut was coming, rather than enjoying the content of the scene. The best service the producers could perform would be to repackage this product as as boxed set and present each episode in its full and unedited form. It would be worth the added price."
2,Sheen Gems,"Fulton Sheen was a great Christian but the Gems cut off so much of the true meaning of his speeches by cutting them off partway. One cannot get the full picture unless hearing the entire speeches. The Gems did include one full length speech in two parts for the last speech he made. This is how the entire DVD should have been made. I was disappointed to only get 10 min. of a 30 min. session, then to go to the next 30 min. segment and get 10 min. again.... This made the DVD and his message disappointing...I would order his full lenghth features only, from now on....."
2,Bishop Sheen ROCKS! But this DVD? Not so much...,"Bishop Sheen is awesome, as always, but this DVD is about 40% Bishop Sheen and 60% cheezy panoramic shots of beaches, mountains and rivers that you have to watch every 5 minutes while listening to the Narrator try to poetically compare Bishop Sheen's performance to roses blooming next to a calm stream in the spring time.The strange montages of bad poetry and shots of people walking on the beach gave me that suffocating feeling I used to get in highschool when we were forced to watch an outdated human anatomy video from the 1970s!I'd usually say its the thought that counts but....not when it costs me $19.99!!!I highly recommend ALL of Bishop Sheen's programs in their full length, but not this DVD."
2,Save your money on THIS DVD.,"I agree with the others who rated this DVD poorly. Whoever did the editing of this DVD did a horrible job of frustrating the viewers by cutting off Bishop Sheen right when he was getting to the point of his topic, sometimes in the middle of a thought or sentence. I was very disappointed. I will search for another DVD of the great Bishop Sheen and I will do a better job of reading reviews in the future."
4,Nice little Slicer,"I've only used a couple of times so far, but this is why I bought it in the first place. Yes, I looked at the more expensive and fancy Mandolins. But, as many people wrote, they generally get used very infrequently and only gather dust in their cupboards.This device is simple, small, easy to use, and cheap. It may not do everything a mandolin can, but it will make the job of slicing potatoes, or carrots a much simpler job."
5,en verdad va directo al espiritu,Es tremenda produccion Cristiana. Es musica para mantenernos en sintonia Divina. Llevaba algun tiempo tratando de conseguirlo. Yo lo tengo se lo queeria regalar a mi nuera que lo perdio en un accidente de transito.Se lo recomiendo a todo Cristiano no importa la religion.
5,Fun and durable,"My in-laws bought this as a gift for my 19mos old son and he has loved it from the moment it was open. He is really into things with wheels right now and he loves to push the cars around. We also purchased two extra cars that go with the set and he learned quickly how to open the big car and put the little cars inside or on top. There are also indentations on each car where the big truck can ""tow"" them. These cars are somewhat squishy, which is nice, and they are very durable!"
1,Awful!,"As a sufferer of this very painful disorder, I am always looking for new information about PTSD. I was so angry that I spent so much money on this video. First of all, on the tape it said it was 50 minutes!! Not really!! It was only about 25 minutes. I learned nothing new about this illness. There were no interesting facts about the illness, or treatment options. I felt like I wasted my time, and money. I urge you NOT to purchase this video. You will thank me later!!"
2,Not the real Mexico,"While full of colorful, well-taken photos, this book does not even begin to represent living in the Real Mexico...very disappointing...the title of this book should be ""How a few wealthy foreigners live in Mexico"". It sadly lacks even the true authentic Mexican flavor that peppers viviendas of the wealthy, and reflects a sterile, overly modern style, that frankly, isn't very representative of what we know Mexico to be."
4,starbridge is still a good read,i started reading starbridge with the first novel. i read the first three and then lost track of the series until recently. this one is well worth the read.
4,The BADFINGER touch,"John Wilson was in a band called ""The DODGERS"" That featured ex-BadfingerTom Evans. John Wilson on this CD touches on many styles of Rock, Pop & blues. He's a great singer & I guess these days he's more of a song writer for others like Cliff Richard in the U.K.There is ''24 reasons"" a song that was written by the late Tom Evans & was added to by Wilson. So if you like Badfinger then buy this CD & enjoy the voice & guitar of John Wilson."
1,read this,william weeler uses his religion to sleep with all his students. they have 2. his youngest was 15. he is hated by british pagans. he is under police investigation because he infected comouter of a welsh girl. police have computer. dont bother buying this book or joinin this group cos this old pervert will soon b in jail. amercian pagans r joinin up to fight against him. world is fed up with him and his threat's

1,???,The author is an American who has hardly visited Wales in his life. His knowledge of Wales is abysmal. He has a handful of books concerning our country. The rest he makes up. If you ever get to reading the book this will be obvious to you.
1,"Lies, lies, lies","I am Welsh - Cymro glan wyr o Ynys Mon, parhaf yn Saesneg.The other reviews on this page have been written by the author of these books. None of them are Welsh and his views and cult are entirely rejected by all Welsh people. In fact this group has no members at all in Wales and does not represent and genuine tradition at all. The author, whose real name is Bill Wheeler, has never visited Wales in his life and the character Taliesin Einon Vawr is simply a figment of his imagination.His writings are such a drag - they do nothing but say how wonderful he is.Don't buy this book if you want to learn anything about Wales. The only thing you will learn here is that the author wants your money. If you are really interested in Wales join rhuddlwm@yahoogroups.com"
1,GAliza ceibe!!!,What a pity this author could not have stuck to witchcraft. He never expected the Welsh to read his book and expose all the deliberate lies. He is now so deeply involved that he cannot retract these lies without destroying the orgqnisation he created. The Welsh are angry with his abuse of there country qand reject him to a man.
1,sad,"i just found this book an insult to common sensenot to mention an insult to my countryllyfr gwarthus, yn llawn celwyddau noeth. prynwch rywbeth call os oes gynnoch chi ddiddordeb yng nghymru"
5,Wonderful Book!!! Best book on Welsh Traditional Magick and,"I attended Rhuddlwm Gawrs classes in the 70s and early 80s. I found him to be a very honorable person as can beproved by the Website that contains some of his teachings. I traveled to Wales and met some of his Dynion Mwynteachers. Later my spiritual path diverged and I ended up going more toward druidism. BUT I can say this abouthis books with no reservation. He is honest, considerate and (too) trusting of a teacher. He may not care whatothers say about him, but I say that all those who attack him and do not want you to read his books are falseprophets only concerned that people will call them liars if you read his books.This book tells a wonderful story of initiation. It will change your life as it did mine. Yes I am a Fan. His books changed my life for the better. Thank you Rhuddlwm for your wonderful integrity and conscience."
1,rubbish,"Total rubbish. Written by someone who hasn't even visited Wales. A pervert who makes initiates sleep with him. A dangerous and evil cult leader who is overcome by hate. Cannot even see through his own lies. An inveterate liar and manipulator. The book is naive trash - made up by Bill Wheeler. His ex-members, like myself, are fed up with his deceit and lies. Dishonest and immoral. This book has little of no relation to the truth."
1,what really goes on,"Check this out if you really want to know what goes on in YTT. William Wheeler, the charismatic leader, is unaware that he is under police supervision and that his website has been monitored for some months.http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004330605,00.html'Devil' pair facing jailFULL NEWS INDEXA COUPLE were found guilty of abusing two teenage virgins in Satanic rituals 20 years ago. Ex-Army chef David Stalford and wife Bette, 55, were warned they both face ""lengthy"" jail sentences. The pair, of Hollesley, Suffolk, performed depraved sex acts on the girls during ""quasi-religious"" candle-lit ceremonies. They were remanded in custody for sentencing at Ipswich Crown Court after being convicted of a total of 11 indecency charges."
1,Mostly Garbage,It's pretty obvious that the author is making this up himself. Each chapter's bibliography points back to his own notes in some other book. I am sorry for the trees who gave up their lives so that this book could be printed. I am sending my copy to the recycling plant.
1,Waste,I Spent a lot oF mONEY On these Books When I Moved To WalesI Wasted Good Money on Books Which aRe Not True
1,what a load of shit,Yr wyf yn Gymro Cymraeg o Gymru. Nid oes ond llwyth o gachu yn y llyfrau hyn. Nid oes neb yng Nghymru yn ddigon twp i gredu'r rwts hyn. Americanwr tew a diddeall sydd yn eu hysgrifennu - un o'r enw William Wheeler.I am a Welshman. There is nothing but absolute rubbish in these books. Nobody in Wales is stupid enough to believe this. It is an intellectually stunted American called William Wheeler who writes them. He has been in Wales twice and is the poorest historian I have ever seen in my life. He is a dangerous fantasist who does not live in the real world. Enter at your peril.A group is exposing his lies:Join the growing crowd of voices who are fighting agains his tyrranny.
1,TAKE IT EASY YOU GUYS,"HI - I'M COLIN, 28 YRS OLD, FROM DEVON. WORKING FOR WELSH WATER / DWR CYMRU. LIVE IN ABERHONDDU / BRECON.

THIS AINT WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WALES.JUST THOUGHT I'D SAY MY BIT - LISTENED TO THAT RADIO PROGRAMME ON RADIO WALES AND IT KIND OF MADE ME THINK THAT I SHOULD CONTRIBUTE."
3,amusing and wrongheaded,"Fred Kaplan is a determined Freudian. His greatest joy appears to be linking James's novels, stories, and plays to his quasi-sexual relationships with his family. This is not entirely implausible, given the sexual oddness of most of the James clan. However, Kaplan could have written a much shorter and more engaging book had he refrained from prurient speculation that rarely adds anything to the elegance of James's work. He ought to have played to his strengths -- a devoted scholar of James's correspondence, he's pulled many amusing and enlightening bits from the great volume of letters James left behind. Particularly good fun are James's judgments on fellow writers like George Eliot and Flaubert. Who knew the creator of such beauties as Isabel Archer was so good at describing ugliness? For celebrity snark, circa 1910, check out ""The Imagination of Genius."" But for a decent biography, stick with ""Henry James: A Life"" by Leon Edel."
3,Amazing pictures but inaccurate information,"I am using this book for an anatomy course and while visually it's one of the best ""picture"" books out there for understanding the soft tissues of the body, our instructor points out mistakes with the labellings or descriptions of the origins, insertions etc. Even some of the pictures are inaccurate. (Teres Major for example). Probably best not to rely on this book for all your information.[...]"
5,A Great Film,"I agree with the reviewer below that The Night Stalker is one of the best films about newspapermen ever made, but I would put one film above The Night Stalker:All The President's MenFor realism and excitment."
4,"McGavin, Wild Stories Made This A Fun Film & TV Series","For those who remember this television show, re-visiting it on VHS or DVD is a nostalgic experience. Darren McGavin was a likable, funny guy as ""Carl Kolchak,"" a reporter for an independent news service who chases after vampires and assorted weirdos.In this pilot show, ""Kolchak"" goes after a vampire in Las Vegas. Ah, a good place for any bloodsucker. Since this was on television back in the early-to-mid '70s, you see a thriller with no gore and no profanity and you also get to see the beautiful Carol Lynley's face again.Darrin McGavin was an underrated actor, a guy who always seemed to make whatever character he was playing an interesting guy. He was great in this short (2 years, I think) television series.The only annoying part of the this film and the TV series is all the hostility toward Kolchak, particularly by his loud and obnoxious employer, ""Tony Vincenzo,"" played by Simon Oakland."
5,A fun tale,"I got this as one of many books for our granddaughter's Christmas package. I know she enjoys books, and William Steig is always a good choice."
5,FABULOUS,"As a mother of several small children and an author and illustrator myself, I can honestly say that this book is simply GORGEOUS. It's one of the most lovely and poignant stories about friendship that I've ever seen. M. Adilman"
1,Pretentious and tedious -- kids immediately smell it as false,"The tedious, self-serving prose in this book reads as though the author loves the sound of his own narative voice WAY too much. His endless, conjunction-addled sentences leave smart kids looking -- aching -- for the POINT. Steig sets up a sweet and caring friendship between a mouse and a whale -- certainly an unlikely pair -- but instead of playing with the natural contrasts there, he overburdens the story with his heavy-handed voice. There is so much focus on despair and helplessness that the story bogs down...and sinks under the weight of Steig's ego."
5,True Friendship,"This is a heart-warming tale of friendship between two unlikely animal characters. The use of animals in a story is classic Steig who delves into a fantasy world and leaves the human world behind. This is a great read aloud book for young children when studying the themes of friendship or survival.The use of elaborate vocabulary also makes this a great story for independent older readers as well. Being written in the third person, the reader is able to experience the emotions of Amos. Steig illustrates this book beautifully with ink sketches and watercolor washes. Truely a terrific book!!!"
2,Good batteries - absolutely lousy packaging,"I always pack AA and AAA batteries. Frankly, it is often easier to just use alkalines and incur the expense rather than be faced with need to recharge.The Energizer batteries are fine. They're just as good as any other major brand.But the packaging on these is absolutely horrible.I wound up using kitchen utensils to force open what should have been a pre-scored flap. Then I had to force open the plastic container that actually held the batteries.I have no idea of why they design the package this way, but it is ridiculous. Fortunately, I was at home and had a kitchen drawer and a tool box to resort to. Had I been on the road, this should be simple task ould have turned into a major irritant.Like I said, the batteries are fine, but I'll be avoiding this brand until they change the packaging.Jerry"
1,Work boots,"Although Amazon.com lived up to its reputation for good service, I was disappointed that my first pair of work boots had steel toes when I had ordered plain toes. Wearing steel toed boots is like putting a soup can on your foot! I contacted Amazon and was immediately emailed a UPS return label. The second pair arrived a few days later and also had steel toes! Amazon reacted by issuing a UPS pickup label and also by giving me credit, assuming that if another pair would be shipped, they too, would have steel toes. I really can't say anything about Western Chief boots, because I never was able to try them; however, Amazon handled the situation very well."
4,How 2 move 55gal of H2O,"In a couple of the construction work camps on the Alaskan pipeline we stored water in 55 gal drums. Okey so you prepared by filling your 55 gal drums of water, so now how are you going to get it out? We set them on their sides with a spigot screwed into one of the caps in the top. You don't have to do that or wrestle the drums with this SIPHON Pump. Ease of use and preparation is in the details. Make it easy on yourself and get this pump to do just that."
5,Works well,"Simple pump, works well. This is the same as you would get when ordering a 55 gallon water barrel, I wanted a backup so ordered this."
1,"Well, it was delivered quickly","I'm afraid that's about all I can say for it. The best I've ever gotten is a dribble, and for all of about six seconds. More pumping, another dribble. It took me about five frustrating minutes to get about four cups of water out of my 55-gallon drum, pumping the whole time. I didn't see anything clogging the pump, or any splitting or damage, although this is a *very* insubstantial-feeling, lightweight plastic. I expected that for the price; I just also expected that it would work, which it certainly doesn't for me. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,it does the job,"not great, not bad, just OK, but you get what you pay for. this was used only for my 50 gallon drum that holds my emergency water supply, and upon first test, it does the job, but don't expect to pump like gallons per minute with this siphon. i would say maybe a gallon per minute. i think if the hose was longer (plastic hose where liquid comes out from) would be better, or you can elevate your container that holds the liquid for a quicker flow."
2,Good Book- Poorly Written,"Having read most of the books available on WWII PT Boats, I find this work full of factual and biographical material, but alas, very poorly written. I would wonder how the publisher let this text material reach the publication stage without some severe editing and/or rewriting."
3,Disappointing,"I was quite excited about the conclusion to the series. Feist is a favorite author and the two earlier books in the trilogy was quite good. I was therefore sorely disappointed when I read Mistress to the Empire and found it to be in a whole other class than the previous two.I am now only half-way into the story since I can't keep my mind on it. The story never grabs me the way the other two did. It's heavy, unengaging and repetitive. There are long sections where nothing happens at all or one is following uninteresting happenings with extra characters. The writing seemed forced and the text never flowed effortlessly.I really want to finish the story but I find myself picking up other books instead since I so often laid it down while reading it. I'm not used to having to tell myself: You have to read it! with Feist in my hands so this was very unexpected.I will finish it someday. But it has to be said: This book was a huge let-down."
4,The end of an outstanding Trilogy,"Mistress of the Empire, full of mysticism, action, adventure and a touch of romance. A fantasy work, well written and perfectly descriptive. The Choja city made me very envious. However, having said this and read Daughter and Servant of the Empire, I felt this should have been a book unto itself. The fact that this was the final in the Empire trilogy, left me somewhat disappointed. Though the story was good, it did not have the impact and energy of the first two, having not ended the series with the vivacity it deserved.Overall, Raymond Feist and Janny Wurts have created together an outstanding series that is well worth the read and I highly recommend these for your bookshelf."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Once again a target.Mara, now a woman of power and influence again finds herself under attack once more. Her family, in the form of her more vulnerable children are targets.This involves a lot of work for her spymaster, and provokes a greater conflict within Tsurani society, with Mara on one side and the magic wielding Great Ones and the Emperor and more conservative elements on one side, in a battle for control.2.5 out of 5"
4,excellent but for the ending...,"I thought this was a beautifully written book. The fate of the cho-ja magicians vs the cho-ja hives and the development of Arakasi's character alone make this book worth the read. Brilliant until the end, when Kevin's re-entry seems a little facile and the happy-joy hugging at the end is a little puerile... the end with Hokanu is truly heartbreaking though. All in all, a must-read."
5,Comfortable& Affordable!,I have found Eastland shoes to be a very good deal for the price. Great comfort and quality!
4,AUSOME!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS WALKIE TALKIE IS A GREAT FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY YOUNG AND OLD. THIS CAN REACH A REASONABLE DISTANCE AND IS VERY AFFODABLE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD WALKIE TALKIE TIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU.
4,Amazon made it possible,"I had for years this measuring cup, it broke but I found a new good measuring cupand are happy"
3,Wasn't what I wanted,"I didn't like the short square body, it wasn't what I had before I broke mine I didn't like the one I got from you I went out and bought one at Wal Mart, different brand."
5,I stand by the Pyrex brand.,"This is a durable piece and is well-worth the investment, over the plastic measuring cups. It will withstand heat, fire, water, dishwasher, thirsty cats, or whatever else you throw at it. Pyrex has won me over!"
5,Great measuring cup,"I've always loved glass Pyrex measuring cups, and this one is no exception. Nice and heavy so it can't get knocked around easily, and best of all, it can go in the microwave without having to worry about chemicals leaching into your food."
5,I love pyrex,"I love the look, the feel, the weight, and the ease of viewing the measurements on this cup. Easy to wash, either by hand or in the dishwasher."
1,"Cheap soda-lime, not borosilicate","I had a 500ml Pyrex measuring cup that I put on the stove (on low heat) to dissolve some malt extract for brewing. I've done this many times with a borosilicate erlenmeyer flask, but figured this was more convenient. Well, while I was gently stirring, the thing exploded into many tiny fragments, some of them thrown several feet away, some of them even getting stuck to my clothing. Thankfully I didn't get anything in my eyes, but I spent the next hour cleaning the stove and everything around it.After some research it appears lab glass Pyrex and kitchen Pyrex are two completely different products. Some time ago the company switched to soda-lime glass (the same stuff used for common bottles) to cut production costs. The Pyrex website claims it's because soda-lime is more durable when dropped, but I thought people bought this stuff for its supposed heat resistance."
3,Made for Leftys,"OK I'll make this short. I don't know about you but normally when I pour anything I grasp the glass with my left hand and pour with my right. If you're like me and you do this, then this is not the right measuring cup for you. The handle is positioned so that if you hold the handle by your left hand you get metric measurements instead of English. This is kinda of annoying when most recipes are in Cups and ounces. I do however recommend the OXO ones with the slotted insert. These are AWESOME! You can read them from the top so you don't have to bring the thing to eye level. They also have more increments than this. Oh and don't get me wrong, I love pyrex, most of my kitchen glassware is pyrex."
1,useless in no time,How come the Pyrex and Kimax labware I have will keep the graduate marks on them through hideous chemicals and severe dishwashing and the Pyrex measuring cup for my kitchen lost ALL of its markers after 2 trips through a HOME dishwasher?I bought this because the 55 year old one from my mother had lost all of its markings. Now this new one is just as useless.
2,Doesn't pour well,"I got this to replace a similar Anchor Hocking 1-quart measuring cup, because that one pours so poorly. Unfortunately this one is no better. Call me picky, but I'd say measuring a liquid is only half the task. The other half is pouring it successfully into a bowl or pan or coffeemaker or whatever.Also: I don't fault Pyrex for this, but the 1-quart line is barely below the level of the spout. If you want a cup with a little more headroom -- so you can stir some powder into the four cups of liquid, for example -- you're better off with the Anchor-Hocking."
5,Glass Pyrex 2 Cup Measuring Cup,"This Pyrex Glass 2 Cup measuring cup Is great to use while baking, mixing, or If you just need the measurement for something else. The numbers are easy to read as they are in red. Highly recommend this Item. The best part of this Item is It Is MADE IN U.S.A.."
1,Quality Issues,Burrs in glass and poor workmanship. I've been buying Pyrex measuring cups for many years and have never seen this. Hopefully an isolated case.
1,Total crap,I bought this measuring cup less than 2 years ago to replace one I'd had for 20 years that chipped after I dropped it. I'll admit I wasn't too keen on purchasing pyrex since there are known quality issues with the glass. I never thought the writing would be first to fail though. I posted pictures to show how it's just coming right off. Every time I wash it more comes off. You can even scrape it off with your fingernail. It's now useless. Maybe I can scour the Goodwill for a proper measuring cup made before World Kitchen LLC started manufacturing.
2,Measurements wear off - can't read them anymore,"The last two Pyrex measuring cups I have purchased lost the painted measuring marks in less than a year. After this problem and reading that Pyrex is no longer the same glass, I'm switching to Anchor Hocking which has the letters embossed in the glass. And every time I see a vintage Pyrex measuring cup at the flea market I'm buying it!"
2,Remember when PYREX had product quality standards?,"Not to worry, no one else does either. The red measurement markings started peeling and fading after a dozen hand washings. That effect required twenty years of dishwasher abuse for my mother's measuring cups. I just keeping hoping it doesn't explode every time I fill it with hot liquids."
4,"Heafty & sold, a little larger than it needs to be","does what it is suppose to, and is durable; my only complaint is that the design of the handle makes it take more space than it really needs to."
3,"Great size, does not pour well","I love the size and durability of this cup, and I'd buy it again, but I am very disappointed in the design of the spout. No matter what you do, you cannot get liquid like water to pour out of the cup smoothly. It is an impossibility, and quite unnecessary. I have a 2-cup Pyrex that is a number of years old. The spout on that cup is crisper and never creates spills. Not sure why they changed the design, but it fails."
5,Cook in it!,I really like this measuring cup. I use it to reheat soup and coffee. Its 4 cup size is never too small for anything I want to put in it.
5,Excellent measuring cup,I lost mine in a move and needed to replace my liquid measuring cup. I looked at other brands like OXO but kept coming back to this classic. The measurements are easy to read. It's easy to clean. And I can put it in the microwave or put very hot liquids in it without a fear of warping or melting (like with plastic or metal competitors). Highly recommend!
5,Finally!,"I had been looking all over the place for this particular style of Pyrex 2-cup measuring cup. Sure I could have saved a buck and purchased an Anchor one from Walmart or Target, but I really wanted the matching set."
2,Made in China Pyrex: only the name remains the same,"Alas, Corning sold pyrex to some chintzy China company and that is what you get now. Much lower quality."
3,Takes careful handling,"Like other reviewers, I'm not too pleased that this is an oversized one-cup. It could have easily been marked for at least another half cup. I did get a decent price for it through an Amazon vendor, $3.99 plus free shipping from, of all places, J&R Music and Computer World, which is about all I would pay for this. My last one, exactly like this one, chipped on the edge with less than two years' use. This could have happened in one of two ways. I was either careless in stacking it in the dishwasher, or stacking it inside the two-cup measure, which also chipped in less than two years. I have used Pyrex for years and never had this problem. In any case, my advice is not to stack this cup and to watch how you place it in the dishwasher."
4,Pyrex 1-cup measuring cup,"I have an older Pyrex measuring cup and I ordered another one so I could have one for both wet and dry ingredients while making dishes. The new one looks a little different than the older one. What I like about the changes are the measurements are spaced well, easy to read and there is a solid line all the way across instead of the dotted line. What I don't like about the changes is the handle, it is shorter and doesn't feel as natural in my hand as my older one does. And the pour spout has been changed slightly too, it's opening is wider. What I'm neutral on is the glass has a slight blue tint to it and is a little heavier. The distance from the 1 cup mark to the top is the same on both of them and I tested the measurements and they are the same too, nothing was off on the new one. Overall, I'm pleased with the cup. I think they should go back to the old handle and pour spout though."
3,OK cup,"It's an Ok cup, i was surprised how heavy it is, i guess i assumed it's mostly plastic not full glass. I find markings a bit hard to read, because they are very tightly together, i think the cup would've benefited from a taller design. Otherwise it's ok."
5,Great product,"This has always been a great product,unfortunately its not available in india,that when amazon comes to the rescue. Only if the postage and import duty was a bit more competitive."
5,Pyrex makes the best measuring cups,"I've had this measuring cup for 4 years now and it still works great. There's not much more to say, I haven't had any problems with it and it still measures whatever I put in it. It it pretty hardy, I haven't broken it yet."
5,I love it,It is a measuring cup for 1qt and is well marked. It is Pyrex and of heavy grade material should las a long time when measuring up to a cup. I recommend this.
3,Awkward,"I didn't see a traditional tall quart cup on Amazon.com and thought that either (a)there might be some advantages to the this squat style or (b)the photo was distorted and this was the traditional tall. No dimensions were given in the description.Wrong on both accounts.1. The cup is heavy and the broad squat style extends the center of gravity far away from the wrist.2. The handle is too short for a firm grip.Result: Considerable more stress on the hand and wrist than necessary, even when empty.Am not sure why Amazon.com or the manufacturer would want the extra liability.On top of that, it is much easier to get more accurate measurements with the traditional tall style.Nevertheless, there are some pros: This has quality materials, with heavy duty glass and easy to read permanent printing. The weight and width make this a great water dish for cats and small to medium sized dogs! It doesn' tip as easily as the tall form :-)"
2,Why the change in style?,"Why the change in style? Why is it so big and fat? I was replacing my 30-year-old model because the paint has worn off. The new one is almost twice the size of the old style. What's the point of a giant 1 cup measuring cup? If I needed something bigger than 1 cup I would use my 2 cup size. I do like the pour spout, unlike my ancor hocking version. I will be keeping this item as I do need to replace my old one and after all it did last 30 years. Just so you know Pyrex, bigger is not always better."
5,Great product,They are the best for measing never breat and can quickly. I bought this for my sister whosekids moving out have taken her measureing cups.
4,Every kitchen needs it!,"Let's face it, if you don't know what Pyrex is you don't belong in the kitchen cooking. They do take a good amount of abuse. Yes, they will break after years of use, but it is just one of those plain old good products that has been around a long time."
4,"Sturdy, but not real Pyrex!!!","This is great for measuring, but it's not real borosilicate glass. This will shatter if you attempt to use this in a lab settings over a bunsen burner.The consumer ""Pyrex"" brand is useless these days."
1,Markings wash off in the dishwasher,"The painted markings that let you know how much you are measuring begin to disappear after a couple washings in the dishwasher. After a few more washings, the cup becomes useless for measuring. I own cheaper plastic measuring cups that have held the markings better and I will be going back to buying those in the future."
1,"Pyrex in name only, not materials","Just had one of these 'modern' 'Pyrex' measuring cups shatter with little to no temp change. It is dangerous for them to call this soda lime glass Pyrex it is not borosilicate like pyrex was originally... this means it is NOT temp shock proof. WARNING this is not pyrex in materials, only in name."
2,"Great Measure, Awful spout!",This is a big measuring cup - just what I wanted. But the spout is so poorly made that it defeats the accuracy of measuring because you can't get the measured liquid out without spilling it all over. Really surprised at Pyrex making such a mistake in design.
1,"Dangerous, Exploded","This this the second one I have had explode when hot liquid was pored inside !! I thought is was a fluke the first time but then read in consumer affairs that after corning sold the rights to the pyrex brand they stopped tempering the glass. The result is people being burned, scarred, and even blinded. Do a google search for ""exploding pyrex"" and you will see all the complaints. Okay, have to clean broken glass off the kitchen floor now !"
1,Pyrex is not what it used to be,I had a pyrex measuring cup for probably 30 years and decided to replace it because the glass was scuffed up. Now I've been through 3 in about 3 years. The markings keep wearing off--not much use that way.
2,Wouldn't buy again,"Pyrex Prepware 2-Cup Measuring Cup, Clear with Red MeasurementsI bought one of these based on manufacturer's name and reputation. I wouldn't do it again. The pouring lip is too narrow and too shallow. You have to pour very slowly to prevent spilling liquids. Anchor Hocking makes one that has better markings, is easier to read, and has a wider and deeper pouring spout. It is also less expensive. My Pyrex measuring cup is now an extra."
1,New design is a messy mess,"I have been using pyrex brand for years. The new measuring cups are a bad design. They measure fine until you need to empty the contents out. The new and improved spout spills all down the front and all over the counter, stove, or floor no matter how fast or slow you pour it.I have a 1 cup, 2 cup, 4 cup, 6 cup, and 8 cup, they are all messy to use. I have lost or broken my old ones and noticed the new design and did not know it would be such a pain. I contacted Pyrex and they told me that they test them out and have not had any complaints. I love their other products but I am trying out other brands of measuring cups. I just hate making an unnecessary mess on top of my mess."
5,great quality,"After 30 years of using the same Pyrex measuring cup, the markings were starting to wear and we had scratched the interior, so we decided to replace it with another Pyrex measuring cup.The local stores did not carry Pyrex, only imitations, so we were glad to find it at Amazon.com.The design of the cup has changed little in 30 years. If anything, it is a little heavier. We are very pleased with it.By the way, since the old cup had no chips or other damage, we donated it to the local soup kitchen. It may last another 30 years!"
5,does its job,"excellent quality of a measuring cup, very useful for mixing 2 cup quantities. item is a bit heavy though"
5,Very Satisfied!,I received free shipping with my order and got it within 1 week! This was very reasonably priced! I had a really old glass measuring cup. I could barely see the measurements anymore! This one is very nice!
3,"Great, sturdy, but dribbles.","This product is great. Sturdy and well made. It only has one flaw. If you don't pour quickly, the liquid will dribble down the side and you will have a mess. If they made the pour spout more pronounced instead of rounded, it would be a 5 star product!"
5,old faithful,looking for this item for quite some time and finally found it and not sure how good it is as it is a gift.
3,Pyrex Cup,I bought this Pyrex cup because from time to time you need something a little bigger than a one cup measure. It would also place my order in the $25 category so I could get free shipping. I am happy with the cup but what I had to go through to get the cup is crazy. I had to walk two miles to my nearest post office because I was not at home when the item was delivered. I have had more expensive items delivered and left at my front door. This is rediculous.
4,"Not essential, but useful","The Pyrex 1 quart measuring cup is not an essential kitchen item like thePyrex Prepware 2-Cup Measuring Cup, Clear with Red Measurements, but certainly has a role for some people.Pyrex makes first rate kitchen glassware. It can handle heat or cold safely, and stands up to normal uses for decades.The two main uses for the one quart measuring 'cup': for cooking for larger groups, and microwaving larger amounts of liquid stuff. When cooking for more than four or so, it is convenient to measure larger quantities at a time. You're doubling a recipe that calls for one and a half cups of something? No worries, pour once and on to the next thing. For microwaving, Pyrex works like a champ. The one quart size makes a large batch of hot liquid easy with the microwave, and you can watch the progress (if needed) through the sides.I don't use it daily, but I'm sure many people do.E. M. Van Court"
3,Not as good as it used to be,"In the past, I've preferred Pyrex measuring cups because of the individual ounce markings, the wide lip and the extra space at the top so I can a another ingredient or two when I'm cooking. However, this replacement does not have the lines for each ounce like the older one did. That's a real inconvenience and I'm very disappointed."
4,"Good, Sturdy Measuring Cup","This measuring cup has a lot of heft to it, which is good for something shatter-resistant.The only downside to this cup is that the measurements are in thirds and not quarters."
4,Durability is an issue,"This item is decently priced at $10, with supersaver shipping, and the 4 for 3 promotion. However, Amazon obviously made a mistake on the suggested retail being $42. In any case, I use this cup almost every day and recently had to replace it. Why? My last one, exactly like this one, also from Amazon, chipped on the edge with less than two years' use. This could have happened in one of two ways. I must have been careless, either in stacking it in the dishwasher, or stacking it to save space with the one-cup Pyrex measure, which also chipped in less than two years. However, I have used Pyrex for years (over 30) and never had this problem before. Actually, there is a third way this could have happened; my husband could have done it and will be advised about proper handling. In any case, my advice is not to stack this cup and to watch how you place it in the dishwasher."
4,"Good product, do the job as expected.","Bought the 2-cup one. Sturdy and easy to use. This glass Pyrex measuring cup is safe from chemical worries like plastics and odor, though not stain resistant."
5,"Sturdy, easy to read","The measurements on this cup are easy to read, and are sturdy. Use it every day to microwave milk for coffee, and my mom has been using hers for years with no complaints!"
3,Beware of variations in finish.,"This is great as a measuring cup. My issue with it is the handle. The two edges on the handle are fairly sharp when I grab it. Still usable and I imagine it's just a fluke in manufacturing since my larger pyrex measuring cup is nice and rounded out, but if you are going to be using this a lot (which I don't), then you might want to consider getting it locally if you can just to be able to feel the handle and buy the one most comfortable to you."
2,Inaccurate and clumsy,"I'm surprised at all the great reviews for this product. While it looks nice and has a nice weight to it, the spout is horrible. It's nearly impossible for pour from it without it dripping down outside of the cup. Also, the one I received is inaccurate. The markings are between 1/8"" and 1/4"" too high so I can't use it for my baking needs because it adds to much liquid to the recipe. The only use I have for it at this point is for scrambling eggs for an omelet."
1,Poor design,"I have always used pyrex glass measuring cups, so when my old one-cup cup broke I wanted to replace it. I'm very disappointed with the design of the new cup. The cup itself will probably hold two cups of liquid. It only has markings for up to one cup. The cup is very short and wide. This makes the markings so close together they are hard to read and hard to pour the precise of liquid I need. I bought another one that I like. I can't imagine why Pyrex made this cup like this. I would have never believed I would review a measuring cup, but this one was so bad I decided to."
2,One Pesky Problem In Otherwise Perfect Pyrex,"I have an ""older model"" of the 1-Quart Pyrex Measuring Cup, so I have a direct comparison. My original is tall and slender, with thick glass. The new version is short, wide and the glass is thinner. I don't know if this makes a difference, but my problem is thus: When pouring liquid, my new Measuring Cup DRIPS. The spout allows liquid to escape down the outside of the container, often outside my bowl. This is not what I'm looking for when attempting to achieve an exact amount of any ingredient needed in a recipe. However, Pyrex is Pyrex. Great for SO many things, and this is a perfect size container for a million different applications ... thus it's impossible for me to give it less than 2 stars. Just keep in mind that you may experience the same issues as I'm having around accurate pouring."
1,Great measuring cup,"I did not buy my Pyrex one cup measuring cup through Amazon.com; I bought my new Pyrex one cup measuring cup at a brick and mortar, national chain retail store for half what the Amazon price is. Pyrex measuring cups are the best brand available, AND they are made in the USA. Heavy duty glass makes these perfect for almost every kitchen."
4,Pyrex 1-quart measuring cup,"Pyrex Prepware 1-Quart Measuring Cup, Clear with Red MeasurementsThe Pyrex 1-quart measuring cup at @4.99 is good value for the money. It is the old fashion type that is made of glass, which makes it heavier and sturdier but more prone to breakage. However, you will not have to worry about the lettering fading over time. Since it is made of glass and larger than most measuring cups at 1-quart size, you can heat up many of your recipe liquids in this measuring cup without making another dish dirty. There are two downsides. First is its large size that takes up more room than other measuring cups. However, I keep it stacked in other bowls to take up less room so this hasn't been that big a problem. Second, it is made of glass. This is both a postive and a negative. I like that it is made of glass so I can cook items in the microwave using this measuring cup. However, it is much easier to break. All in all, I am glad I made this purchase."
5,The only one to use,"I ordered this because a review on America's Test Kitchen said Pyrex was changing the design, which would make it harder to read the measurements. I bought the 1-cup, the 2-cup, and the 1-quart cup also. The 1-cup measure is also tall enough so you can add some other ingredients without spilling. They are nice and heavy, which will mean they should be around for a long time. The handle is a great design for versatility and larger hands because it is open at the bottom. Easy-to-read measurements. They stack well together. And they are made in the USA!"
3,Disappointing quality,"Like many of the other reviewers here I was tricked by the pyrex name, expecting a durable, well-made product that would last for years. The measuring cup I received was poorly constructed, with about half of the glass being bumpy/wavy rather than smooth and straight (see the Customer photos - I uploaded a picture of the wavy glass). I would return it, but it's a fairly heavy piece of fragile glass, so it would be a pain to pack up and ship back. Giving it 3 stars because it does in fact hold liquids, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this to others."
1,buyer beware,"After I received this 1 QT pyrex measuring cup, I foolishly did not use it right away.Months later, when I finally did use it, I discovered there was something wrong with the pouring-spout-part. It is extra small and does not allow for pouring!Imagine my surprise when I tried to fill up another container with the contents of the Pyrex measuring cup. Instead of being able to pour into the other jar, it ended up all over the counter.Literally.Since Amazon will not allow for returns, I will contact Pyrex directly.But really? How did they screw up such a simple thing?Compared to my older measuring cups, this was a waste of time and money."
3,Pros vs Cons,Pros:Easy to holdResistant to being droppedCons:measurement labels wears after about a year and a half of using 3times a week(avoided by hand washing only)-label wears from bottom upPour spout causes drips if poured slowly.
1,"Don't bother buying, not the same PYREX!","I bought this measuring cup as PYREX was a name synonymous with quality, durability and price. My mum always swore by PYREX. In fact I had just finished watching a TV show called ""How it is made"" and the cup was featured; we watched how the product was made from start to finish. The measuring cup I purchased looked nothing like the on the show! It had a red bottom about 1/2 inch up the glass and had clear red markings.My red marking wore off after 2 trips in the wash.........what happened PYREX?"
5,Measuring Cup,"The pyrex measuring cup is the best, but I have quite a biased point of view on anything Corning. My mother worked at a Corning plant for many years and still has a set of dishes she bought there over 30 years ago. The dishes have survived moves and 4 children and look as good as ever."
5,8oz is 8oz...,"Not much to say about a measuring cup...it measures liquids accurately. Sometimes I will microwave in it, and it is fine for that as well. These Pyrex glass cups are pretty much a requirement for anyone who cooks or bakes."
5,Every kitchen should have a couple of these,"I'm a bachelor, and this is the ultimate thing for your kitchen. It's indestructable, you can microwave it, you can put it in the oven, and you can actually even cook it on your stove like a pot.So, if you're in a pinch, this can replace the following: Pots, pans, water boiler, casserole dish, cups, mugs, bowls, plastic measuring cups.I always use this to make Jell-O, because I make the fast Jell-O where right after I boil it, I cool it rapidly with ice.It's about half as tall as the usual version. I'm pretty sure that's so it can stack with the ones that are only 2 cups. And 1 Quart = 4 cups, if you don't want to zoom in on the picture."
5,Great gift for the cook,"This was a gift for someone learning to cook and she loved the size and shape, which she said were perfect. She felt they were very stable around young children because of the shape, and easy to read for accurate measuring. Although I've read a bit about lower-quality in this product of late (as in Pyrex not being what it used to be) these seemed to be a nice quality."
1,wrong items,"I ordered the items on 10/6/2006. It is not K8NGM2-FID, instead, it is K8NGM2-NBP. Amazon has tried to send me the item once more, but it is again the wrong items. I am pretty frustrated that Amazon would only refund the money, instead of offering the lower-line model K8NGM2-NBP at a reasonable price minus all the hassle it has costed. It is such a shame that after 6 years of shopping with Amazon, that is all it can offered."
3,"Good product, but not practical","The product is made of good quality. Upon testing the mic picks up the friction noises easily, but cuts the conversation in the middle sometimes. It might be a combined problem of the voice activation setting of the walkie-talkie and the mic unit. The mic is also highly directional, which is not a good feature for this unit. I get this mic because I try to use it while biking, and the unit will not interfere with a bike helmet. If you don't have to wear a helmet, try the mic that comes with the head piece."
5,Learning to Pray,This is a very small book but lays out the many facets that can be included in a structured prayer as well as suggestions for including individual supplications.
3,A coherent collection of writings,"This book is a collection of excerpts from various scientific writings over 1500-1800. It provides the reader with all the ""basics,"" actually starting before the time period covered, with some writings from Aristotle, Plato, and Lucretius. Most important scientific figures of the time are included here (Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Bacon, etc), as well as many of their lesser-known contemporaries, and excerpts are thoughtfully abridged to include only the necessary parts.If you're looking for a concise collection of primary sources of this nature, this is a good book to check out."
4,"Pop, Soul, and Pseudo Hippies...","Certainly dated yet by no means dead, Naturally provides the listener with a small fragment of this group's enormous talent --- despite the second-rate lyrics. Driven by the incredible vocals of Hutton, Negron, and Wells, the album was a welcome change from their earlier works in both style and studio engineering. The bittersweet slash of Argent's ""Liar"", masterfully translated by the mournful, twisting riffs of Michael Allsup's guitar, arguably stands alone as the album's finest moment. Forget the overrated ""Joy to the World""; if the listener can stomach low-level soul, occasional flubbed lyrics, and the pseudo-hippie mysticism of ""Heavy Church"", the album is a brief gateway to a less taxing time, and, regrettably, too brief a statement by such a phenomenally talented group."
4,Natually A Good Album,"This was the first Three Dog Night album I bought back in 1970. I liked ""Joy To The World""(45rpm mono mix) and bought the single which was slighty different from the album version as well as Liar on a single and to my surprise, it too was longer then the mono mixed single. The actual song that caused me to buy the album was ""One Man Band"". Funny too because the single was in stereo and was the same mix as the album. Other then that, I still have the vinyl copy, bought the CD version some time ago and still like the album alot even though I still believe they were a better singles band then a album band. So if your looking to try out some Three Dog Night albums. Make your way to this one, not their best but a fine album to listen to around the house or on a long drive. By the way, got sick of hearing ""Joy To The World"" when it was a hit and skipped it ;-).Check out my site ""Judemac forever"" and say ""Hi"" google it."
4,Great influencial band and cd....this is where the Uriah Heep sound came from !,"I revisited this cd and one of their many ""Greatest Hits"" compilations. Then i noticed the similarity between Uriah Heep and this band. Now i know where their sound came. ""One Man Band"" is pure Heep and some other tracks do sound similar as well.The Tree Dog Night s' 3 vocals are very similar to Uriah Heep s' 3 vocal arrangement.This is a great album, full of good songs by good sonwriters mainly RUSS BALLAR (Argent) who penned LIAR, originally recorded by ARGENT.ONE MAN BAND should be recorded by URIAH HEEP !The instrumental track is awesome and JOY TO THE WORLD is a classic number one single !"
5,"So many great late 60's, early 70's bands","Just because you don't make the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, does not mean you are not a timeless classic flower power, love your brother, rock n' roll band. You get the still fresh ""Joy to the ""World"", the underrated ""I'll be creeping"", and the rich ""Heavy Church"", along with the classic ""Liar"". Worth the price, especially if you don't have any bands that harmonize well and often. The musicians are highly underrated. Hope they restock the double album CD, get that if they do."
5,great pen,these are the best pens for that personal touch the grace of the style and weight allow for comfort while composing a letter or just signing a check
4,A Sesquepedalian's best friend,"If you knew what the title to this review meant, or just wish you did, this is the kind of book you can buy and actually just read for fun; it's quite interesting. At least, if you're as big a dork as I am.However, if I happen to have spelled that wrong and you neither noticed nor cared, then you're probably going to be pretty bored. And, quite frankly, that's pretty respectable in it's own right."
1,Pure crud.,"I bought my home-schooled child all of these books and they didn't teach him a gosh-durned thing! Jerome Shostak needs to learn how to read before he writes a book on telling other people how to read. This was crud! Pure and simple! Read ""Lizard Music"" by Daniel Manus Pinkwater if you want a book that will teach you new words, and help you understand life and give you all the secrets to the world!"
1,What's the point?,The price to value ratio is poor. The content of this tiny booklet is available on the internet for free while the layout and press quality are amateurish at best.
3,The FMEA Pocket Handbook,"Purchased to carry with me to whatever site. Good, concise, and handy. I also use as a ready reference when teaching FMEA."
5,Little book does big things,I brought this pocket guide needing something concise about Failure Mode & Effects Analysis FMEA. This is it. It gives just enough to be useful as a memory jog but not too much to become too much information TMI. Well worth the cost.
3,"Decent book, but I've seen better","Very, very disappointed. That's how I felt after falling for the hype...and buying this book, and its companion, ""Type in Use"". I already own a copy of Robin William's ""Non-Designer's Type Book"", and that book covers the exact same material in much better detail. ""Type Rules!"" has a few decent examples, but not enough to justify buying yet another book that covers the exact same topic.If you're looking for a good book on the foundations of typography, check out Robin Williams ""The Non-Designers Type Book"", instead. Except for Robin's annoying attitude (easily remedied with a black felt-tipped pen), that book is easier to read, far more helpful, and includes lots more relevant information for the desktop publisher...If you're a designer, and looking for a good book on typography, swallow your pride and buy Robin's book. You won't be disappointed (keep the felt pen handy)."
4,"Fun, cute bath toys","These adorable toys are my 7-month old daughter's favorite. They are the perfect size for her little hands and she loves catching them as they float around in the tub. Also, they squirt out water, which is fun."
2,Disappointed,If you are looking for a book to help you with sandplay therapy symbolism for children this is not it. It is a nice book and well organized but it does not include anything practical for working with children.
5,"Not only fascinating, valuable!","This book is not only fascinating, but highly valuable! I am a director, acting coach and teacher. Research is required. When exploring dramatic texts, this book is one of the best references I have come across. Beyond its practical use, however, it is also a pleasure to pick up and scan for interesting information. It brings depth of understanding to the world we live in. It is a gem!"
1,Blowhard fluff,"I have been looking for another symbols dictionary and thought I had found it when I ordered this one. I was sorely disappointed. It isn't very comprehensive, and the author is rather pedantic, taking a long sentence to say a little thing. It really isn't very helpful for understanding most symbols in literature, though it might help with a select few."
5,Best Country Music CD in the Last Decade,"This is the best courntry music cd released in the last 10 years. The new single ""It Must Have Been Somethin' I Said,"" which is track 2, should be song of the year!"
4,Good in itself.,this movie is well controlled and not aimed for a simple fun.the storyline is interresting and satirizes a moralism in certain circumstances. this movie can be excellent if you possiblely don't have any preconception or image about the famous actors.
1,"A very weak script, and poor performance, done in poor taste","This movie belies the star performers in it. The story line is weak, the performance by Jack Lemmon amounts to a walk-on, cameo appearance and Lily Tomlin and Dan Aykroyd are NOT funny. The movie is in poor taste and I am sure the performers are embarrassed after having participated. The performance of all the actors, especially Lily Tomlin and Jack Lemmon is very weak and way below their capabilities. A VERY bad picture not worth your time."
4,Grossly underated,"I am not a professional review of music, however I know what is good and quality. This is one underated album. The playing and song content are great. This is one of my favorites and has aways been. If you are a fan or at least familiar with GFR do yourself a favor and give this a listen-and crank it!All the Girls in the World Beware"
4,Ok on second thought.,"I've listened to it a few times now, it's not a bad album. If you're a new GFR fan, it may not be the CD of them you'll want to buy. The title track after listening to it is Mark Farner's tribute to his cousin who died in a motorcycle accident. ""Dues"" and ""I fell for you love"", are a few tracks i liked as well. ""Geneieve"" is an instrumental which includes a live a bonus take as well. ""Talk to the people"" is a jazzy tune, but very likeable. Too fun songs are the bonus track ""bare naked lady"" and ""good things"". I like the cd much more that i listened to it a few times. Not one of GFR""s hardest rockers though."
2,Let Down,"Another disappointing outing for a great band in decline. Iwould not recommend this one to anybody,unless they needed it tocomplete their ""Trunk Of Funk"". {That's why I bought it}. Thereare two songs that do stand out however. ""Born To Die"" and""Dues"". Maybe they can be found on singles,or downloaded. Butdon't give up on this band yet. There is some good singing andgood playing in their future.Thanks"
1,snore....,This is why we old GFR fans stopped buying their stuff...it just dosn't rock. Snore. Get the old stuff (first 4 LPs)
5,Happy,"completely satisfied, and good to know i dont have to change this filter as often. Has made the acceleration a tad more perky but im hoping for better mileage but havent taken any long trips , and the local mileage has held steady, same as new paper filters as far as i can tell"
3,Not bad,I thought the performance will be better but I didn't feel anything great about this filter except it's re-usable! Actually the gas mileage has gone down since. Not sure if it's due winter or if it's due to the air filter.
4,Seems good to me,"I have a K&N in my car so I decided to add this to the girlfriends. She has a 2006 Toyota Matrix. It fits snug, but that means there's a good seal. Her stock filter was horribly dirty after just one year, so it'll be interesting how this holds up. It's impossible to tell if there is any improvement in performance. I don't drive it daily so I'm not sure about the gas mileage either. Buy this for its reusability, not its performance. My only complaint is the little ""Do Not Discard"" sticker isn't sticky enough to attach to the air box."
5,WINDCHILL SUMMER Takes You Back in Time,"There has been so much revisionist history about the 1960s -- and especially the anti-war movement -- that it's refreshing to read a book that feels right. Mailer nails the tumult and joy and confusion and fear that marked the era.She also has a wonderful sense of place and character. After reading this book, I know what it feels like to be tall, thin and Southern, even though I'm not."
2,this book is definetly overrated,"i really didnt like this book. i found the characters to be dull, unengaging and cliched and the plot to be standard.the whole thing reminded me of one of those preteen point horror books i used to read when i was younger; shallow, unoriginal and patronising.suffice to say i will not be buying any more of this author's books."
5,Leaking the truth,"As a non-reviewer of this non-existant item with no picture, no reviews, no information about the content of the book, no publisher's data or review, I can only hope I don't piss people off by offering a review. Inasmuch as only the title is available, and the book no longer exists, I will review the title. It certainly offers valid, empirically verifiable preferences. It is highly recommended advice!"
5,These 'Skinned Alive' are copies bootlegs ...,"FYI-The copies being sold on amazon are bootleg copies from vas entertainment.They have no legal rights with the film/filmmaker. That is why they are being soldfor near nothing. Unfortunately, they've been trying to liquidate these copies here.Legit copies are being sold from ""Skater Made"".Take note of film poachers."
1,"Typical formula billed as ""light jazz""","This is a typical example of the generic, formula-driven music that has taken over jazz radio, disguising and trying to legitimize itself by using the term ""light jazz"". There is nothing passionate about this album. There is no soul or feeling - nothing that reaches into your heart and makes you - beyond explanation - yearn for more. There are no stirring melodies, only some ""doodling"" on the guitar. Nothing on this record is unique; everything has been done before. This album is neither joyous nor sorrowful, neither melancholic nor exhilarating, neither discouraging nor inspiring. It's like eating a raw oyster - there's no flavor, no consistency, no substance. It is ""safe"" music - no envelopes are pushed, no boundaries are stretched, no rules are broken. This is just next in a genre that has gotten more and more stagnant with each passing record."
5,So solid I'm shopping for a second,"The Evans BD Pillow has worked well for me over the past 8 years or so. It was a door prize at a MI PAS convention. I managed not to lose it so I am shopping for a second for my second BD. I use it in a 26"" with Aquarian Super Kick heads and it BOOMS. I use it on the batter with a small hand towel on the resonant in my smaller 18"" BD too. Quality material has kept it in one piece and the nylon seam makes it fold nicely to control the amount of contact."
1,Very dissapointed,"Cheap junk. The bottom of the pad attaches to the drum shell with velcro, which is fine if you don't mind glueing something to your instrument. Then you move the pad up against, or away from the drum head. It doesn't matter how you adjust it, the ""hinged damper pad"" weighs maybe an ounce or two, and does nothing to dampen the drum, no matter how you adjust it. If your looking for a dull ""thud"", you'd do better with an old blanket your dog is tired of. At least it was only twenty bucks. Absolutely the first time I've been dissapointed in anything shipped by Amazon."
5,Evans bass drum pillow,"You couldn't ask for a better product. Easly to install, easy to make adjustments if you have a kickport or port hole snapped in your resonant head. Easily works on both batter or resonant heads. Get one!"
3,reps,"the reps keep it pure and simple on their debut. there is no question about there street credentials as they spit fire over underground beats that hit as hard as tyson. this is one of the best boot camp clik albums to come out in a while. my favorite song is ""the rich"" which features tek from cocoa brovaz. this album includes no wack r&b hooks and no commercial rhymin with them. the reps keep it gutta and with good results. the only problem i have this disc right here is they dont really break any new ground and it gets kinda repetitive. other than that its bangin. one"
3,A mess of a mass,"Schubert's last mass, shortly before his death at 31, is as lyrical as they come. The ""Credo,"" with which composers have the most trouble, is incredibly lyrical and poetic. The music is a masterpiece, but unfortunately, Vienna orchestras have raised the ""a"" to 442. It doesn't sound like much, but it becomes screechy. Add to that, the tempo is too fast. The whole thing sounds like a race against accuracy and good taste."
3,Acceptable,"Actually, I wanted to buy the Messe G-Dur and I bought this one by accident and it is ok but i definitely prefer the other one."
5,Classical,"I give this Album 5 stars because Of the Best Lyrics ever seen on any album. Now the Beats are not as good today as back then, but for back then the beats were pretty good, but put it like this, the beats are good and The lyrics are classical, Nas rips the tracks up in this album, If you want to get a classical album to show off your hip hop collection, pick it up right now, get out your seat and get it."
5,Simply Classic,"It's simple, this is one of the best hip-hop records of all time. Nas comes armed with double and triple metaphors, tight and intricate narrations, and rhyme style that takes Rakim to the next level. Every song is well executed and the Nas' youth shimmers in his abrasive, sometimes contradictory, and often hyperbolic, pronouncements. This is one of the few records that I would say is absolutely essential for understanding how to listen to rap."
5,What is a classic?,"Illmatic without question is a classic album. This is the album that made Nas the artist that he is today. Even though this album has only 10 tracks (9 if you don't include the intro) it's still a magnificent piece of work. All 40 minutes, will keep you listening. You notice that Nas rhymes with intelligence, and has a flow that is different from everyone else. One of the best albums I ever heard, Nas is truely the king of NY."
5,i must give this 5 stars,"i must give this 5 stars... i don't want to, but i can't help myself... my hand has taken over, it can't deny the pure street poetry and lyrical genius that this album has... never has one so effortlessly catalouged the exact details of the projects or any hood or ghetto without revelling in endless violance and mocking of women/...I must also give this 5 stars to prevent it from being dragged down to the DREADED ""3 and half STAR"" RATING, that pathetic cliche inbreds like Nelly and his ilk possess with kids going ""greatest rapper ever""... HA... the fact that they call them rappers obviously means they have no clue about hip hop...lyricists and thug poets 4eva...peace..."
1,"Pac Never Liked You, Get The Picture","This album lacked good beats which is a pattern for Nas along with beat-stealing. This guy, like Jay-Z make me sick. They both steal from 2pac even though Pac clearly never liked either one of them. Nas and Jay-Z sample far too many beats and lack creativity. Neither one are worth a damn and bring down the value of the east coast rap scene. That's why the westcoast is number 1, they can't hold a flame to Dre, Xzibit, Ice Cube, Too Short, or even Daz, Kurupt, Shaq, or Warren G. I'm sure if I guy that didn't like me spit on the mic about my cred or lack thereof, I wouldn't steal his beats in order to get the spotlight. Nas will never be as good as 2pac and more people need to realize that Nas is foul. His bad songs definitely outweigh the good which in undisputable. Ooooooooh, I'm a loser named Nas and I need to steal the beat from Cream's ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" in order to release my first single for my album."
5,The perfect hiphop album,"What can be said about Illmatic that hasn't already been said? Well, to make it short its one of the best hiphop albums ever made. Every track on it is fantastic. It has some of the best producers in hiphop working on it, and has Nas at his artistic peak. His lyrics are art and sometimes go by you so fast you have to go back and listen to the track again to truly appreciate his expertise at rapping. His verbal weaponry and delivery come off fast and smooth and you can't help but be stunned with the talent this man has. If you like rap or hiphop and haven't heard this, you need to get it now! These days the music industry is saturated with phoneys and talentless hacks and mainstream hiphop is 95% garbage. This album is a 90s staple and captures hiphop in my opinion during it's peak of creativity (1988-1995 or so). What are you waiting for, get Illmatic already!"
5,MASS HYSTERIA IN YOUR AREA!,"This is Nas at his prime. Nas has that sick rhyming flow and that sick production backing him up making this album flawless. Nas is never the same again after Illmatic but still delivers it hard unlike most rappers (don't worry I'm not looking at you 50 Cent)...50 Cent is a guilty pleasure of mine but he will never be as great as Nas. Nas made NY known once again and had the crown but soon stolen by Notorious BIG. When he died it came back to Nas and HELL NO! it's Jay-Z. Nas, forever my favorite rapper! Recommended to any true hip hop fan and I swear you won't regret this."
5,BEST EVER,nas debut album illmatic is by far his best cd ever and in my choice one in the top 3 best hip hop albums of all time along with 2 pacs me against the world and big puns capital punishment. the lyrics are so creative and amazing compared to the bs coming out nowadays. but there is no need to write a 3 page review for the this album as you can see on most of the other reviews illmatic is one of the best ever. so cop it chea 1
5,Classic,"The production on here is immaculate. At the time you didnt need alot of money to get Dj Premier, Larger P, Pete Rock, Q-Tip to produce your alubm, you need skills. On one side Nas' Illmatic is a blueprint on how to make an album, On the other it is a lyrical masterpiece. Every Line, every drum, ever sample is on point. Illmatic wasnt a commercial hit, and thats part of its charm. Illmatic has no room for flaws."
5,It's Illmatic,"This is a classic. What else can describe this album? The beats and lyrics are flat-out amazing. Illmatic conveys Nas' emotions on to record as he talks about the pain of the streets and the violence and chaos that surrounds him. From the sad ""One Love"", to the upbeat ""Memory Lane"", to the freestyle-anthem ""It Aint' Hard To Tell"", Illmatic is classic material from start to finish. Illmatic has some of the best production in hip-hop from the likes of Large Professor, Q-Tip, DJ Premier, Pete Rock, and L.E.S. Nas has never released an album that can compare to this. If you don't have this, pick it up."
5,Classic,This cd is the best. If you are a rap fan you should get this cd right away. This cd is a must have!
5,Classic,"Illamatic is the best album in rap history. No doubt in my mind, along with Common's Resurection it is also the most underrated album. He brought a new fresh ryhme scheme almost five years ago and his lyrics are still untouched. I can go 1 through 10 with never being dissapointed in any of the songs. It defines classic."
5,"""It's mine, it's mine, its mine.....Who's world is this?!!!""","I love this album! I just bought it again (for the third time) because as soon as someone finds out that I own it...""I'm Jacked"" for it. Disregard all his other albums. This is Nas when he was Nasty Nas. This is classic material. My Favorites: ""The World is yours"", ""One Love"", ""It Ain't hard to Tell"", and ""Half Time"""
4,2nd CD,"The Remixes are hott, but aint ALL DAT. On the real and star wars are hott.PeaceD.R. , BK , REP!"
5,Nas tha only rappa,"dis cd is tha hardest cd ive evr herd in my life. Nas wuz so hard bak then but i feel dat he still is becuz no rappa has got NE thing compared 2 him. he has 2 b tha hardst rappa alive... Nas owns tha rap game, n its not hip hop either... illmatic is definitely tha kind of stuff u wont hear on tha radio. he is tha rula. there is no way ull evr hear NE songz like dis on ur radio. dis has 2 b his best cd ever. theres just wun problem about it tho, he duzent put down jigga like Stillmatic. the song ether in stillmatic just makes me laff each time."
4,Good customer service.,"I ordered a CD, got the CD in the mail it had a skip. Contacted customer service asking for a replacement. Sent the CD I received back, got the replacement which had another skip. This time I asked for a refund and was given one right away."
4,Great old school hip hop,"Not too many tracks on this c.d., but nearly every one of them shines. It's too bad Nas didn't stick with being illmatic, this is definitely when he was at his peak."
5,classic,"i've had this CD for a while, and it easily crushes almost any other rap album recorded. only legendary records like Paid In Full are better. NY State of Mind is one of the flyest tracks i've heard. def a top 10 album"
2,overrated,There were 4 good songs on this album. Don't believe the hype. It's not a hip hop classic.
1,Overrated,there are about 50 better new york rap albums. This is sadly overrated by the media and magazines. The beats are very boring and I only enjoy one song(Memory Lane)
2,NO WAY,No way in hell is the CD the best ever made. I am so upset I finally bought this album and it disappointed me so bad. I love premo but this whole cd sounds like it is biting off 36 chambers sound and they didn't even do that well. Everyone was talking about the lyrics. They weren't that great. If you want a classic cd get GZA's liquid swords. GZA smokes NAZ on lyrical ability. I don't even want to mention my man Pharaohe Monch. Don't by the CD it is way to hyped up. Save your Money.
1,"Most over rated, under rated cd ever!","What was the source thinking calling this the most under rated cd ever? Its under rated because of the trashy lyrics over the supreme beats of Gangstarr's Premier. This joint belongs nowhere in the same category as Mobb Deep's Infamous or Raekwons Built Strictly for Cuban Links. Buyer Beware! Nas' flow is choppy and raw. With It Was Written producing two decent cuts that were both radio, Nas on his first album talks about all that back to Africa fake hard core rap. This album is just about as bad as his acting in Belly."
1,Overated,"Illmatic is probably one of the best lyrical hip hop cds out there. The beats are not as impressing as I thought that it would be. With people ranting and raving about the best hip hop album of all time with only 10 songs? The beats are not impressing, all that is good is rymes. If u want a good classic rap cd, I suggest Death Row's Greatest hit. THat is a good cd"
3,Don't mess with perfection,"Don't get me wrong; the original version of Illmatic is a MUST have. This version, however, I can do with out; and it's all thanks to the second disk. The ""updated"" remixes drone out the original quality of the first one; a couple of those were already inlcuded on his Illmatic To Stillmatic remix album. That's what makes the re-release of Notorious B.I.G's Ready to Die great; because it includes rare tracks that are hard to find, and doesn't bring down the quality of the original recording. Just get the original version."
3,Grossly Overrated,"this cd is better than an average rap album but nothing special. It only has 10 songs and half of them are good and half are fillers. Nas might have the most boring voice out of all the mainstream rappers, if you want to fall to sleep listen to this album and listen to the crappy beats from the so called amazing producers. The only reason this gets 3 stars is cuz nas does have awesome lyrics but that is all he does have in this forgettable cd."
2,Not worth the hype,I can't belive people think that this is the best album of all time. I love premo but this whole CD is biting Wu-Tang's enter the 36 chambers sound. I kept hearing that the lyrics were so ill. They were ok. I am just very disappointed with the cd because I read the hype and it really let me down. This cd is nothing compared to GZA's liquid swords. GZA smokes NAZ. I feel even Biggie is better than NAZ. Pharaohe Monch would eat NAZ for lunch. Save your money and download this cd.
4,"Only 39 minutes long, but all 39 minutes is great as h**l","I gave it 4 stars, even though the song are worthy a 5 star rating I felt like I couldn't give a 5 mics since the album is so short, it should have been named an EP instead since there are only 9 songs (one is only a intro).I can't deny it, I think that 39 minutes for a rap-album is really cheap. The average hiphop-album is 60 minutes but on the other hand the average hiphop-album aren't as well done as this is.Nas does his best rhymes ever on this cd, and the best songs are ""Represent"" ,""1 time 4 your mind"", ""N.Y. State of Mind"" ""Memory Lane""... Sh*t there ain't any bad songs on this album...Buy it if your cool with paying fullprice for a half-length album."
5,the record straight,"there is to much beef in hip hop these days, but i just gotta set it straight for quannum from cali. First i must admit i'm westcoast, and i generally really like or love all that stuff you cited in your review (quannum, heiro, etc.) but seriously-is there any artist on any of those labels that would ever dare to say any of their sh*t is better than this? no way...there is a raw, braggadocio, bottled lightning -tyle, confident, thematic, genius to this album that is unparalled under the circumstances. Don't you ever feel that b-licious flow is a little nasal and artificial at times? this was made in 1994. I will conclude by submitting, that, were it not for the excellence of the beautiful and sublime illmatic, half, minimum, of those groups you love would not have been relevant. thats my word."
5,THIS IS CLASSIC HIP HOP RITE HERE,"If you dont like this album then start listening to Rock&Roll or sumpthin. This is pure hip hop. It has no flaws at all. The lyrics are amazing the beats are incredible this is what rap is all about. And nas only has one guest rapper showing that he can rap a whole album with no help. And even AZ's guest rap is good on the jazz influenced ""Life's A Bitch"" NOt too many people like It was Written but they have to understand Nas was experimenting. Now with ""I am"" he produced yet another classic album. There is no stopping Nasir Jones"
3,Is this necessary?,"Illmatic was designed to be heard on a CD. Moreover, the recording technology for CDs was pretty good in 1994. Not surprisingly, Illmatic as a recording sounds good. Very good. Is it necessary to remaster the original tapes? Probably not. This strikes me as a way for the record company to make a quick buck. As others have already indicated, there are a lot of great remixes already out there, and none are included on this collection.Don't waste your money. If you have the original that should be good enough, and if you don't, get it immediately."
3,BETTER THAN MOST MODERN HIP HOP.,I have some respect for this rapper because he has a very distinct rap style and his music has some substance to it.He doesnt just rap about being ghetto or how wealthy he is but raps about empowering his people and real life issues.The music in this album was pretty good and I would recommend this album because I dont really like rap but I enjoyed this one.
3,ok,"don't get me wrong but beats were ok, he could've done better and made this the best cd of all time lyrics are better than the beats. nothing really special like ""Nas is Like"" etc. Lyrics are nice but i can't cop this, i must get Nas' later work, i can't bump this bass is too weak don't get me wrong lyrics are ok also but beats need to be tighter."
3,"Classic to some, not to me.","I like all of Nas' material, so I bought this because the Source magazine and others said this CD was a classic. Sorry, as much as I like hip hop, no, as much as I LOVE HIP HOP I just wasn't feeling this. Maybe it was just that day.Lyrically, Nas is always deep and for an MC at that time his content was thoughtful and provoking. I guess it was just the beats I couldn't get into.I may purchase it again to give a more detailed listen."
4,"Nas' best album, this is real hip hop in its purest formm","I cant believe this album has been overlooked so much. This is one of the best ever! Nas was at his lyrical best, his flow was on point and laid back and he can tell it like the best of them. Just listen to songs like, ""The World Is yours"", ""Half Time"", ""One Love"" and ""Aint Hard To Tell"" and you see Nas is a lyrical genius."
2,Wow Come on,"When you advertise illmatic, the original cd you should be selling the the original cd. Not the 10 year anniversary of the cd. Not cool man. Besides the fact that the extra tracks are dope you did me dirty yo.... not cool"
5,"An album that anyone who listens to rap,Must Hear","Although only 40 some minutes long,This album is the best (If you are looking for lyrical diamonds in the rough).All I can say is if you get this album,you will not be dissapointed,track 2,5,7,and 9 really stand out.But the whole album is the best (lyrically out of QBC)---If you are looking for ""gangsta"" from QBC (see Mobb Deep--The Infamous)"
5,Quite possibly the greatest rap album of all time.,"Nas' debut album, ""Illmatic"", is undoubtedly a contender for the greatest rap album of all time. This Queens prodigy's superior lyrical flow is clearly evident from the head bopping ""NY State of Mind"" to the smooth, laid back ""It Ain't Hard to Tell"". ""Illmatic"" is one of those unique albums that you can listen straight through and not have to hit the fast forward button once, a rarity in this day and age of suspect rap albums from even more suspect MCs. Definitely a hip-hop masterpiece, definitely ILLMATIC. JD"
4,From One Nas Fan to Another!,"If your a Nas fan, you need to get the CD that started it all! Favorite tracks: life's a bitch and ain't hard to tell but then again, the whole cd is what it is and should be! A REALLY GOOD ALBUM!"
5,Classic!!!!,"Illmatic is Nas' debut album, and I have to say that I never seen a debut album as good as this. He make a classic ith only 9 tracks (excluding the intro). Nas will remain the King of NY, and the most influencial lyricist alvie.Favorite Tracks: The World Is Yours, Represent, One Love, It Ain't Hard 2 Tell, and NY State of Mind"
5,WHAT CAN I SAY,"THIS IS A FIRE STAR CLASSIC AND IS EVERYTHING THAT A RAPPER SHOULD BE POETIC, REALISTIC, LYRICAL NOT MUCH THAT CAN COMPARE TO THIS OFFERING THIS IS LIKE GIVING CONFESSIONS TO THE PRIEST NOTHING COMES CLOSE TO TRUTH AND HONESTY. NAS' ILLMATIC IS UP THERE WITH PE'S BUM RUSH THE SHOW & KRS ONE'S CRIMINAL MINDED, ETC. AND WHAT RAPPER DO YOU KNOW WITH NOT ONE BUT TWO FIVE MIC LPS IN THE SO-CALLED HIP HOP BIBLE, THE SOURCE. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSISTENT RAPPER (IN MY OPINION)THAT I'VE EVER HEARDNOT EVEN GONNA BLESS U WIT MY FAV TRACKS EVERY ONE ISPEACETECHWON"
5,Possibly the GREATEST album EVER,"1994 was a HOT year in hip hop and this album shows why. My favorite MC of all time, Nas, set the hip hop world on fire with his debut album Illmatic. This album has ALWAYS been a favorite of mine and it will continue to be as long as I live. Here's the review:Album Highlights: The entire album. There is NO fast forward material on this album.Production: Thumbs UpLyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs UpOriginality: Thumbs UpThe Last Word: THIS album is a landmark in hip hop history, a true masterpiece. If albums like this were released today, hip hop would be SO much better. Overall, this album IS EXCELLENT, and I strongly recommend that you have this in your collection."
5,amazing,"this album is so good, i have only listened to the first four tracks...over and over and over. maybe one day i'll get tired of them and move on to track 5, but i doubt it."
5,Greatest Rap Album,"Nas's debut album is lyrical genius. This is the greatest rap album ever. The way Nas deliver's his messages and stories told on this album are epic. The beat, the flow, the words, nothing is considered inferior on this album. Tracks to look out for are NY State of Mind, Life's a B****, Halftime. If you are into rap, and you don't own this album, then you are no fan of rap."
5,Classic,"If your a fan of hip hop then you already own this album or atleast heard it before. This is Nas at his best, nothing but classic beats and classic rhymes ! No song on here is worth skipping, its a must listen. Az is the only artist featured on here and he kills it on ""Life's A B"", even though I love the whole cd my personal fav track is ""Memory Lane"" with the dope sample and the way Nas just goes in is ridiculous. With production from Preemo, Pete Rock, L.E.S & Large Pro what more could you ask more? Its a must have, Classic 5/5"
5,Beyond ill,"This is the best hip hop album of all time IMHO. Flawless from beginning to end. The only problem I have had with it in my dozens of listens is that I have started to take Nas' verses for granted, when just about each and every one is some of the sickest rapping that's ever been put on wax.This is an album where I can totally feel any song as somebody's favorite, but for me it's either Life's a ***** or One Love.Buy this album or your collection won't be complete, even if you're not into hip hop at all."
3,why all the hype ?,"ok ok I know most people think this album is a classic but I gotta disagree....Nas has never put out a classic and never will. ""God's Son"" is clearly his best album but cannot be considered on the same level as ""Chronic 2001"", ""Eminem Show"", ""Reasonable Doubt"", ""The Blueprint"" or the best album of all time ""All Eyez On Me"" Nas has ordinary beats with decent lyrics but is totally overrated as an artist....don't get me wrong I like his style on certain tracks but he is not capable of putting a completely solid disc together the whole way through."
3,Nas-The Ghetto Imposter,"this probably would have been a classic if it was longer,this album is entirely too short,but overall a good album,especially knowin that nas was so young when he made this album.tha only problem is nas wasnt living none of tha stuff he was and still is talking about,he was watchin it on tv.nas is a phony,but this is a good album,not classic"
4,n-a-s,nas is real east coast rap next to mobb deep his the best . well i think this album has nice rymez and the beats are kind of boring if your just starting to lisin to rap you shuld start by lisining to the artists older cd's first to see what his all about.dont just go out and buy a rapers newest cd if you never herd his first cd's .
5,Hip hop how it's meant to de done!,"Nas raised the bar so high on Illmatic that he himself couldn't jump over it with his later albums. This captured everything right about hip hop;far from what its detractors said about its glorifying of violence and drugs; the story of a young man and his quest for something better in life than what was handed to him. If you love good music, get this album."
5,IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER!,"I figured since everybody else reviewed one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all-time that I should add my two cents as well even if it's 2008....this is a timeless work of art before you....it will never get old....compare it to the mona lisa...from the intro ""The Genesis"" right on through Nas's vivid NYC narrative will hold you captured...With Production By Pete Rock,Large Professor,Q-Tip and Premier....you have some of the greatest beat makers to ever do hip-hop along with one of it's greatest lyricists...how could this FAIL...As Nas himself says ""I Excel then Prevail"".....nuff said....if you don't have this in your collection then you don't have a complete hip-hop catalog...."
3,Rattenbury,This is a well researched and written history about a man who was instrumental in the development of modern Victoria. He was a visionary but also a con man. It is unfortunate that his life ended the way it did. It is one of those stories that makes fact stranger then fiction.
1,So Dissappointed,"We ordered this tool set with the bronze finish. It arrived looking beautiful and well made. After only 2 weeks of use, I went to wipe the dust off of the shovel only to find that the bronze finish had come off and it had started to rust. The hook tool was also missing finish and was starting to rust. I would not recommend this product."
3,3 way coupler,This would work good if your dogs already walk on a leash correctly. I put 3 big dogs on and they had it tied into knots in no time. Train your dogs to walk beside you first before trying them on a 3 way coupler!
5,"insightuful, thought-provoking, life changing","I WAS IN THE UNIVERISTY WHEN I FIRST HAD TO READ NGUGI'S DECOLONSING THE MIND. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THIS WAS THE BOOK THAT DEFINED THE DIRECTION OF MY COLLEGE CAREER. THROUGH PERSONAL EXAMPLES AND GENERAL OVERVIEWS OF THE CORRUPTION OF THE NEO-COLONIAL AFRICAN STATE, NGUGI HAS WRITTEN A MUST-READ FOR ANY AFRICAN WHO HAS COME INTO CONTACT WITH WESTERN CULTURE, MAY THAT BE THROUGH LANGUAGE, SCHOOLING, OR ONE'S PLACE OF RESIDENCE. UNTIL I READ THIS BOOK, I DID NOT REALIZE HOW PROFOUNDLY THE RACIST NOTIONS OF THE WESTERN WORLD AFFECTED MY THOUGHT PROCESS AND THE WAY THAT I VIEWED THE WORLD AROUND ME; ESPECIALLY THE WAY THAT I VIEWED MYSELF. THIS BOOK WILL BECOME INDISPENSABLE TO ANY PERSON THROUGHOUT THE AFRICAN DIASPORA WHO HAS EXPERIENCED ANY OF THE FEELINGS OF DISPLACEMENT, SELF-HATRED, AND ANXIETY THAT NGUGI SO ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBES. A MUST HAVE."
3,Jake not up to par,I really missed Jake's marvelous finger work and usual enthusiastic arrangements. This album was rather dissapointing. I loved his first two!
1,Jake,I wanted to hear Ukealele music but just got a lot of women screaching. Threw it away it was that bad..
1,Lousy Phone from a lousy company,"Panasonic products seem to be engineered to start failing exactly after the 1 year warranty. First, this phone started losing battery power after about 30 minutes of talking. Changing batteries didn't help. A couple of months later, the charging has completely stopped.Incidentally, my Panasonic DVD player failed exactly 1 year 3 months after I bought it."
3,RV Trip Review,"I really enjoyed the second half of the book more, when the trip actually got started. However, for non-experienced RVers the first part of the book would be very helpful."
3,Why an RV van camper,"I thought this was a well written book. Two people could easily make the same type trip using an ordinary van or even an SUV. The authors spent so little time actually camping. Why spend so much money on a camper van if you are not going to use it for camping? A front wheel drive van or an SUV would have cost about half what a van camper costs and would get much better mileage as well as handle better. The authors spent most of their nights in motels or hotels. A regular van could easily accommodate a mattress, porti-potty and a plug in ice chest. This would have reduced the cost of a year's travel by 10 to 20%."
4,help is helpful,"this book is very well organized and written for easy reading. although it is about an extended trip, my interest is in shorter adventures but more of them. the thoughts expressed in the book are helpful for planning either type of travel with interpretation to fit your personal situation. because carol and phil covered so much territory, you gain an even greater appreciation for how much there is to see and do in our magnificient country."
5,listen to the voices of first-hand experience,"Phil and Carol White amply demonstrate that anyone can live ""a road trip dream"" as they thoughtfully share their proven insider tips for enjoyable RV travels. Interesting to discover, according to the authors, that a big mistake first-timers make is overplanning. Read this book and ""just do it!"""
1,It's just a diary,"I would not recommend this book, it is nothing but a diary put in book form. No insights worth the price. The budget and travel forms are most helpful, but not worth the price of this book."
4,Get inspired to travel!,"Carol and Phil White were retirees with a dream: to travel around the country on their own, for a year, without running out of money or energy. They planned, they budgetted, they kissed their children and grandchildren farewell, and they headed out.This newly revised manual and travelogue tells how they did it, both in practical and human terms. They provide budget plans, recommendations on transportation choices, insights into travel decisions, and suggestions for websites (including their own) which provide more information and tools. The first half of the book provides the planning tools and suggestions; the second is the diary from their own travels.Anyone interested in long travel, RV use, or travelogues should consider this readable, useful volume."
5,The book is awesome,The book is a awe inspiring piece of literature. I enjoyed every single word. The words are perfect. I enjoyed every sentence. There should be more books like this. Cost effective advice
3,Too General and Dated,"While reading about Phil and Carol's adventure was entertaining, I found the practical information somewhat limited in scope. It dealt with budgeting in a pretty general way, and did not really address financing such a trip at all, other than selling or renting out your house. Workamping and working from your RV was not dealt with.Also, as their trip was c.2000, the material is quite dated on anything dealing with technology.This book is written from the perspective of retired seniors taking a one year road trip of a lifetime, not full time RVing.*edit: I was made aware that I have the original printing of this book. There is a newer edition which, if you order the book new from Amazon, you will get, and it deals with the information Carol mentions in the comment response to this review."
1,Road Trip???,"These two authors basically drive around the country and pour out verbal diahrea on boring facts about their trip that no one in their right mind should care about. They are actually proud of the fact that they only???? spent 80k in one year of travelling. They must have lived like anaimals! Also, Carol seems to use the exclamation point way too excessively in her writing! If you are not retired and are somewhat of a young age please avoid this book. I did give it one star because if you have a good sense of humour you might enjoy her little stories!"
5,fun,I got this bought for my parents who just retired. It directs people on how to live on the road and sight see without spending your life savings doing it.
1,"DISAPPOINTING - Cost $77,000 for their year long trip...","The title of this book is misleading - it says you can live on the road for the same price as staying at home - however, the authors spent about $77,000 (not including any house or mortgage payments while they were gone) - that comes out to about over $3,000 per person, per month. What a ridiculous budget - if I had that much money to spend, travelling in an rv would be a piece of cake - the rest of the book is fluff and gives no practical advice.Well, obviously, it gives no practical advice about saving money because the authors splurged. I feel cheated by the title of this book."
4,Excellent primer for an extended roadtrip,"This is an excellent primer for a very extended road trip, but it's not about being an rv full timer. The authors decribe intending to be ""full timers"" for a year with only incidental trips home for holidays and emergencies. They describe the evaluation in purchasing an rv and provide plans for living at camp grounds. But they stayed in hotels 4 to 5 nights a week and ate at restaurants even more often.So it's really about their road trip to see the contiguous states in a year, how they planned & prepared, where they went, what they saw, and how they dealt with personal and family emergencies.There's a good routing plan to see the lower 48 and many sites are described in detail, including many ""do""s, ""don't""s, and ""watch-out-for""s.The most valuable sections describe their analysis for dealing with the day-to-day responsibilities they left behind when they're on the road, far away."
4,Helped Us Understand and Plan Responsibly,"I read 3 books about the RV Lifestyle before we left on an adventure of our own. Carol & Phil's book was head and shoulders above the rest with regard to offering helpful advice, and inspiring the excitement of living on the road.Carol and Phil traveled for a year in their Class B RV, ""The Rolling White House."" They played a lot of golf, visited a ton of National Parks, enjoyed several Happy Hours, wrote a very good book that you'll find invaluable in planning a similar trip....... and, mostly, stayed in hotels. Carol's take on their transportation selection is very sound, and she has included many tips about planning and executing a trip (in any kind of RV) that may not cross your mind until it's too late, and she does it all with a personal touch."
3,Good,"""Live your road trip dream: travel for a year for the cost of staying at home"" seems to be an okay read."
1,Problems with my Yardman,"When I bought my Yardman there were only good reviews. I see that has changed. First the seat is designed for someone with really short legs, all the way back and your knees are stiil in your chest. To empty the bagger you have to tip the seat ahead. Since I mow when the grass is wet(Live in WA), the tube plugs up often. But it is not designed to disconnect from the mower easly.The blades are made from to soft of steel and bend too easily. So if you hit any gravel or other obstuction, you end up with a bent blade and an uneven cut. They don't offer a heavy duty blade. I wouldn't recommend using on anything but smooth level ground."
1,Yardman Opinion - Piece of Junk,"I bought a 17.5 hp 42"" Yardman 2-1/2 yrs ago. After 1 year(39 hours)I had to replace BOTH spindle assemblies (shaft that holds blades). You can't get just the shaft, even though it does come apart - you must buy the whole thing/bearing and housing. Cost of repair about $200. Today I took it in again because there was a problem with the thing going forward. I now have 79 hours on it and the transmission is shot. I wouldn't have another Yardman if someone gave it to me. The shop thinks the company might pay for the repair due to low hours and as soon as I get it running again, I'm going to get rid of it ASAP. Hope all of you new owners have better luck."
3,SO FAR NOT SO GOOD!!!!,"I finally got my mower today that I had ordered back on July 6th. I was told the mower would ship within 24hrs, boy was I surprised when it took them a week to ship. The mower did come packaged well with no marks or scratches. 2 of the tires were flat and the battery was dead as a door nail, I had to jump it with my truck.I hope when I cut my grass tomorrow everything goes smooth.I forgot to mention when I purchased this thing it was 1299 and a week later it went down to 1199. Just my luck!!!"
5,Awesome!,"The show is a fantastic mix of visual metaphors, special effects and beautiful music. A must have!"
5,Great!!,Some people are disappointed with the way the series ended but either way I think it's a good ending. A must-have for DC fans!!
1,D/J,"I have read many reviews here, but there is one thing everyone is leaving out. Kevin Williamson explains that he wanted Andie in the entire finale not just one 90 second scene with Pacey. He explains that the show was writtin to have Pacey & Andie end up together, and Dawson & Joey end up together. It would not have worked to have Pacey & Andie, who haven't talked in 7 years (going back to season 4) sit down for one scene, and have them end up together. Andie was working on another movie at the time and could only stay for one day.So the re-writing that Williamson did, not just for the second hour, but for most of the finale didn't have much to do with letting the story take him where it should. He was left with no other choice. A Pacey/Andie ending would have been far better than a Pacey/Joey ending anyway.After all I think Pacey & Joey are on world war1000 by now. And we can't forget how Pacey feels when he is around Joey. ""When I'm With You I Feel Like I'm Nothing""Now that's chemistry!"
1,An unfortunate misstep.,"A show that was to define an entire new genre in its first season goes out on in the exact fashion it sought to lampoon, punctuated by an ending that invalidates the premise that was at the very heart of the show. This transparent attempt to generate revenue from an extended treatment of it's ""shocking"" ending is neither surprising nor warranted. Best to turn the spigot off here and redirect those hard earned funds toward something that kept its integrity and stayed true to its heart, such as Shout Factory's ""My So Called Life"" or the pre-Star Trek J.J. Abrams signature, ""Felicity""."
5,Good show weird ending,I thought they could have done better with the ending of this series but all in all the entire series was good. At least there was an ending nowadays your lucky if they even let you know the show is canceled.
1,Retired Fan,"I am still shaking my head in disbelief over the way this show ended so I am warning any real old school fans of the show to just skip this episode entirely. Nothing about it made any sense. Dawson and Joey, who were in love from the pilot episode until the second to last episode, didn't end up together. It was a complete travesty. Seriously the most unsatisfying conclusion to a television show I have ever witnessed. What kind of crackerjack staff doesn't have the main couple end up together? Are they trying to turn us all into hardened cynics? Again, I ask you to heed my warning and skip this DVD. It is a terrible end to a show that once had a lot of potential."
2,Meh,"Two stars for not causing any damage but not doing anything useful, either. My main impression of this stuff is residual stickiness and I noticed no change in my skin."
5,More than 3hrs of Shakespeare,"If you like long movies, beautiful language and Shakespearean plays, this will do. What's more, the cast is exceptional (Kenneth Branagh, Kate Winslett, Bill Crystal, et al.)."
5,THE READINESS IS ALL.......AND I'M READY FOR THE DVD!!!!!,"At last, after waiting for a long time, Kenneth Branagh's four-hour version of ""Hamlet"" comes to DVD next spring! The extras (unconfirmed):""To Be On Camera: A History With Hamlet"" Featurette""The Readiness is All"" FeaturetteCast and Crew InterviewsDirector-Screenwriter-Actor Kenneth Branagh Commentary*I cannot wait! This is gonna be AWESOME! Grade: A+*Totally unconfirmed"
5,Branagh is the best Hamlet I've seen.,"Though this film attempts to take on some aspect of ""big hoolywood movie"" having famous actors and the like (i.e. Robin Williams, Billy Crystal etc.), this may be its only downfall (Robin Williams, though his part is small, is noticably not for Shakespeare). Kenneth Branagh is so exceptional at portraying Hamlet that any shortcommings of the movie fade. He is by far the best Hamlet I've seen (and I've seen many performances). He does not overact, as many do when reading Shakespeare. He makes Hamlet a human, a man despite the words he speaks, which are not typically expressed in general conversation. If only to see his performance should you see this movie. This is not the only draw though; the visuals and interpretation of the text make this my favorite version of Hamlet's performance yet."
4,Methinks Kenneth doth overact too much,"Im a huge fan of KB. He made shakespeare real, brought meaning to the dialog in a way that no other actor has or perhaps will. Henry V is the finest on screen portrayal of a any shakespearean play. I adored Hamlet, but I felt it was slightly OTT, vaudevillian and camp. However, I hate to be critical of a piece that reaches for perfection. Mel Gibson's Hamlet was in my opinion much better in terms of the complete piece (although KB's own portrayal is on a different level) and more compelling a movie."
2,I've Seen Better,"Hamlet is one of Shakespeare's best plays, but this movie really doesn't to it justice at all. The production was huge and lavish and the cast was studded with big-name stars, but I dound the movie itself to be boring. I found trouble having anyy sort of empathy for the prince as Branaugh portrayed him. The previous Hollywood version starring Mel Gibson as the prince of Denmark was superior in every way. This movie was flashy without being moving. It was just ""blah"". It just goes to show that spending a fortune on production and on famous stars does not necessarily make for a good movie."
5,wonderful,"I must admit with many, Branagh was hard to take at the start as Hamlet. Although fantastic as a Shakespearean actor, he wasn't my favorite Hamlet. With that aside, this is a wonderful production. Although Helena Bonham Carter is my favorite Ophelia, Kate Winslet was fantastic. This full version was a welcome interpretation of this timeless tale. I couldn't review this film extensively (for reasons stated below) but I can say this is the most memorable Hamlet yet! And Alas! there is finally a widescreen VHS version! I was lucky to have seen this film in it's full version (4 hours and in 70mm) in the theater. I really haven't seen it since. Why? Because it was in 70mm, a ""pan-and-scan"" version would be horrible! The sets were breathtaking! Some people may not know this: but not only was this film in limited theater release but the 70mm true version was even more in limited release."
4,Hamlet by Branagh,"Well, we had to wait almost a decade but it's finally here: Kenneth Branagh's monumental production of Hamlet, on DVD for the first time. I'd been using a VHS/video version for years quite successfully but all good things come to an end. The tape had started to wear out and the colour didn't seem as fresh as it could have been.Happily, Warner's did the right thing and digitally transferred it onto DVD for all of us Shakespeare afficionadoes! In short, it's magnificent. No problems with regional codes or additional technologies.William Shakespeare's Hamlet (Two-Disc Special Edition)"
5,Best Hamlet yet.,"Of all the film versions of this Prince of Plays, and I've seen them all (the talkies anyway), this has to be the best.Although full length, I think uniquely, this is at no time apparent. Even the star cameos are done well. Faultless."
5,Amazing Theaterical experience!!!,"I still remember taking that 10 minute break while they changed reels back in the day when I saw it. I still haven't the foggiest clue what those english people are saying, but what'a ride!"
4,"No booklet in ""Special Edition"" DVD","I was disappointed that there is no booklet included in the 2-Disc special edition DVD. I was hoping, given that this production uses the complete dialog of the play, for a reference that would link acts and scenes to discs and chapter numbers. But nothing... not even the half-sheet ""poster"" insert that many budget titles include.Is that really worth a ""star?"" Of course not. The production is surely worth the 5 stars that most people are giving it. I have not had time to sit down and watch it in its entirety yet, but a few quick peeks suggest that a good job was done with the DVD transfer as well (viewed upconverted to 1080i)."
3,The Complete Hamlet,"This is a very fast-pased movie. It uses the acts and scenes and even the ""additional scenes"" from the entire play. I think the movie is a bit too overdone. However, there are many great and enduring scenes.Dhevan G."
5,A superior movie!!!,This is the best movie version of Hamlet so far. Kenneth Branagh does an excellent job as Hamlet and Kate Winslet does a good job as Ophelia.
2,Unbelievable ham-fest!!!,"I found this movie almost impossible to watch. To be sure, there are some incredible performances here, turned in by some legendary actors. But Branaugh manages to ruin the film with his obnoxious over-the-top ham acting."
3,this movie could have been marvelous...,"okay...I don't want to offend anyone. I know much more about modern literature than I do Shakespeare, but as a critic and a fan of Shakespeare's work, I must say I was disappointed with this film. The actors range from brilliant to annoying; the worst being Kenneth Branagh and Kate Winslet: both are lifeless stage actors who are too insecure to be on film. They don't know when to be quiet and when not to yell. Also, Shakespeare's beautiful language is either spoken too fast or too slow. Also, Hamlet was written in the Renaissance, therefore there were no palaces of Enlightened Despots, and certainly no guns. I think that the cinematography and lighting was brilliant though, and that's probably why I gave this pitiful movie 3 stars at best. I wish Kenneth Branagh wasn't so horribly arrogant and misdirected - oh wait, he directed himself...well, anyway...don't get this movie. Sorry that I had to be so negative...go buy Othello or Macbeth."
1,Worst Hamlet,"I recently watched this, along with the Laurence Olivier and Mel Gibson films. I thought this was by far the worst. Most of the actors sounded like they were reading Hamlet, rather than being the characters. The worst by far was Jack Lemmon. How in the world could a great comedic actor be allowed to embarrass himself with such a ridiculous performance. Not only was he too old for the role, but he sounded like an old American reading Hamlet for the first time. It was painful to watch. Robin Williams looked like Robin Williams doing stand-up.I also did not like the memory flashbacks. The audience is capable of imagining what 'poor Yorick' looked like as he bore Hamlet on his back. We didn't need for the film makers to act out the memory."
3,Bardolotry,"Hamlet cries out for cutting, for complete removal of the martial frame & merciless editing of LONG asides on the theater wars & the art of acting that STOP the play. Branagh is NOT a bad Hamlet, especially when he quiets himself (a particularly nice graveyard scene performance), but Jacobi might have been better employed as Polonius, Winslet is an unconvincing Ophelia, Christie is neither here nor there as Gertrude, the Altmanesque cameo casting is distracting (though some of the celebs perform capably), the opening & closing scenes are grossly extravagant (Hamlet is NOT Henry V?), the straight jacket & modern fencing gear are silly notions, the whole thing rings stiff/false/inflated. The 1990 Zeffirelli/Gibson is truer to the spirit by being less obviously obsessed with the letter?"
2,Bad costuming choice.,This is an Elizabethan play with Elizabethan language. But the costuming in this movie is not of that period. That spoiled it for me. Changing the time the play is supposed to be in doesn't add anything to it.
3,"Oh dear, oh dear","I know that as a character Hamlet is not supposed to be all warm and fuzzy but it is well if there is something about the actor playing him that makes one content to spend a little over four hours in his company. I'm afraid that Kenneth Branagh doesn't have it. If he did, he's lost it and I hope he gets it back before we are subjected to another huge chunk of Branagh chewed blank verse.This Hamlet was like being in the wintry presence of the most humorless of vice-principals for an entire ice age. The only warmth were the real sparks generated by Derek Jacobi and Julie Christie as Claudius and Gertrude. Oh, how I wish they had been left alone by their querrulous bad tempered overaged boy."
1,Give me a break,"I love Shakespeare and I was really looking forward to this movie but when I saw it I was so dissappointed. I nearly left at the end when Branagh (playing Hamlet) is portrayed in a Christ-like crusifiction pose. Give me a break! Literary criticism aside Hamlet is no Christ and neither is Branagh! What was he thinking! The whole thing seemed like a mess to me, as if he couldn't make up his mind what time period it was set in. If you want to see Hamlet, don't watch this movie - go see it on stage!"
2,Where Are The Grace Notes?,"I know I'm going to catch hell for this review, but I've tried to watch Branagh's Hamlet twice and quit half way through both times. This is not meant pejoratively, but Branagh's Hamlet is an assault on the senses. He brays and he mews and he mugs for the camera. Where are the grace notes? How can the Dane be such an unsympathetic character? Winslet's Ophelia is a raving hysteric, Polonius a caricature of a hypocrite, Lemmon woefully miscast, his line readings leaden. The soundtrack, always intrusive, at time overwhelms the dialogue. Bigger is not necessarily better. Give me Olivier, even Gibson, any day."
5,I've been waiting on the DVD,"I fell in love with this movie at age 12. It was one of my first introductions to Shakespeare, apart from my mother's 'Macbeth' bed-time stories. This movie truly captures all the emotion of the play, and is, in my opinion, the best cinematic interpretation of 'Hamlet' ever made. I have been waiting for this DVD for too long, and cannot recommend it enough to anyone desiring a fulfilling, emotional movie experience. I laugh, I am moved to tears, and that is what a good movie should do. Branagh is superb, as it to be expected, and the score by Patrick Doyle is excellent as well."
4,"""For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.""","I gave four stars for the film alone and minus one star because of all the problems I have been having with the download. The file itself is somewhat choppy and I can only play it in my Windows Media Player, any other way and my computer freezes. If you are a lover of Hamlet and are too anxious to wait for the DVD (since we have been waiting forever now) than I would go ahead and purchase it. But be ready for a long download, I went to bed and it finished right when I was getting up and I have DSL!"
5,Beautiful.,"This is the most stunning Shakespeare film I have ever seen. It is an epic development of one of Shakespeare's most enigmatic plays, and Kenneth Branagh fills out the character brilliantly while maintaining Hamlet's mystery.Buy this movie!"
3,Captioning?,"Well done, brings the words to life and bestows new interpretations and possible meanings on the plot. But I found I enjoyed it better when I was looking half the time at the text. Captioning it (I watched on Amazon Instant) would have made it for me. Nevertheless, another stellar performance by Branaugh and other fine actors who are intelligent enough to interpret Elizabethan English."
2,Did not look brand new as advertised.,"Online it said it was brand new. However, when I received it the case looked totally used and somewhat mangled."
3,Know when to step aside.,"Yes, this is one of Kenneth Branagh's productions of Shakespeare; and he typically saves the most interresting role for himself. He is a good actor, but in my opinion, the multi-emotional role of Hamlet is beyond his ability. When Hamlet is instructing the actors he hires for the play within the play, he begins to act, but then stops himself in deference to the troupe of real actors, headed by none other than Charlton Heston. Branagh should have taken a cue from Hamlet."
5,"This is the second set I ordered, I love it so much","I bought this second set to have it with me to watch with my granddaughter, 7 years old. She loved it. We have to fast forward over some scenes. But this blew me away: our four-year-old granddaughter loves it just as much.It truly is incredible."
3,"Notable effort, less accessible than other efforts. Mixed casting.","I have liked Kenneth Branagh's other Shakespeare films. I appreciate that he doesn't reduce the plays to sing-songy recitals. Having said that, he seems to have a weakness for some inappropriate casting. Let's start with Jack Lemmon. I like Jack Lemmon. He is a gifted comedic and dramatic actor, but he had no business whatsoever playing a guard in Shakespeare's Hamlet. Now, I know Ophelia's supposed to be mad, but Kate WInslett's Ophelia is simply incoherent most of the time. I'd have preferred Helena Bonham Carter, but with her you have to take Mel Gibson as Hamlet.The choice of Julie Christie as Gertrude, on the other hand, is inspired. Her performance makes sense of a woman who would sleep with her murderous former brother-in-law.All of the plot points are made clearly for once, but except for Hamlet's ambiguity about the status of humanity in the cosmos, most of the subtle stuff gets short shrift."
2,"I love Branaugh, but I give his Hamlet a 2; hear me out, OK?","I try to watch all Branaugh's films. In this one he created a surreal set with past, present, and future all mixed-up together. He brought so many different extras that it looked like a circus. I understand that this was supposed to heighten the sence of madness and chaos in Danish Kingdom, but he went too far... I mean, five hours of this circus, give me a break! He tried to pile too many ideas together and as a result the film turned out to be some sort of a thick, chewy stuff that never ends... I have seen three other Hamlets on screen and I am sorry to say this is not the best one."
5,The Best Hamlet for the Classroom,"Teachers: This is the best version to show in the classroom. It sticks to the play verbatim. Branagh is excellent and carries the play, although like all actors who play Hamlet, he is too old for the part. The presence of Billy Crystal and Robin Williams adds absolutely nothing to the play. Jack Lemmon and Charlton Heston add more than the other two clowns. Kate Winslet does a fine job. I highly recommend this."
5,A great rendition!,"I gave this rendition 5 stars because not only is it the entire play, but the scenery is beautiful and the actors are superb! it is also bereft of the strangeness you find in other versions of Hamlet when directors try to modernize or adapt the play for existing political conditions."
2,Not up to Branagh's usual standard.,Odd selections of supporting and cameo-type rolls (Jack Lemmon as a palace guard???). Glaring sets. Stilted portrayal of Hamlet. Just not what I had come to expect of Branagh. I'd choose Mel Gibson any day over this.
3,"Well lit, uneven performances,","Second time is not a charm for this modern remaking of Shakespeare's longest extant play. More cinematography, less integrity does not a perfected film make. What is lost in this interminable remaking is the sense of the Jacobean world in which is was created. The temporal shift does not improve our understanding of the topical nature of the events presented in this well coded theatre. Branagh is well prepared, but at least 10 years too old for the role. Ophelia is delightfully insane, but plays against a dumb wall of morbid incompetence in the other actors. The Bard would puke."
2,To watch or not to watch,"I've seen three versions of Hamelt, this version if I must give a rating is a 2 star at best, without a doubt the best version of Hamlet is the Mel Gibson version. Basically he made me understand Hamlet and the old world language with the way he pertrayed the broken hearted Dane Price, He injected passion into the role of Hamlet to the point where I could then say "" Oh ok I get it now """
1,this movie liked it in the balloon knot.,"This movie royally sucked. It's too effing long and I was bored of it and kenneth branagh is the worst actor I have evr seen in my life... this movie made me wanna kill myself and hamlet and shakespeare. Don't buy it, do me a favor and don't buy it. This movie is royal trash at it's best."
2,I wish i could have just died,"This book wasnt good 200 years ago and it certainly isnt any good now. We are confronted with a question here, that question being why would someone redo a movie over such a terrible book. The answer is quite simple, they need money and these actors if you want to call them need us to watch them so they get money. This simply cannot last and i emplore all of you ever humyn being to not see this movie or by it, please the fate of humynity rests on your shoulders."
5,Enjoyed!!,"Hamlet is always good. I've watched lots of versions of this movie, and I never get tired of it. Every time I watch, I find out something new about human nature. Hamlet is about the dark side of nature, but it's told in such a way that we can all see ourselves in this story."
5,FINALLY!!!,"I was introduced to this version of my favourite Shakespeare play in senior year of high school english class (2004) on double-VHS and have been waiting for a decent release on DVD ever since! This is by far the best version i have seen of Hamlet with superb acting, great sets and most of all - the complete play! This is probably one of the few DVDs i would be willing to pay full price for when it first comes out. Ironically, i was just telling someone a 3 days ago that i can't wait for this to come out on DVD because it's been so long waiting for no good reason. A must see!"
1,"Ken, Give it up","Kenneth Branagh has become so annoying in his one-man quest to do every Shakespeare lead-role that I want to warn others: If you have seen one of his films, you have seen them all. The only thing I remember from each of them is his patented, wimpy soliloquies. He does every one of them the same, ending each line with an unpleasant intonation, as if every line were a question. Maybe he was wondering what he was going to look like on screen when he recited the lines, rather than concentrating on becoming the part. Unless you are a glutton for punishment, don't watch any of his films."
1,Grave!!!,"GRAVE CASE OF OVER ACTING. Superficial!, apparently did not comprehend what essentially Hamlet (Shakespeare)was denouncing...."
1,Peeeeeyyyeeewwww! What a stench!,"Oh, dear Kenneth, puhh-leeeeease! A classic case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes""--- most people think if a hammy actor blusters his way through a recitation of archaic english, it MUST be brilliant. This picture looks like an easy paycheck stroll for a tired group of ham & cheese actors. Read the play."
1,I would rate it 0 if I could...,I've been forced to track this down for my thesis - not only was that near impossible the movie was rather large (at around 4 hours I think). I thought the 1990 version was slightly better and even that sucked. All I can say about this movie is that it is good to look at. I think it is an egotiscal piece at best however faithful to the text it is.
5,"All the passion of the stage, with the beauty of film","So much has been written, I'll be brief. This is a fabulous version of Hamlet. Beautifully shot, well-acted, and complete in its scope. While certain other film versions of this classic play are wonderful in their own right, this version of Hamlet captures the full-ness of the play, with all its subplots and variations. Everyone should see it."
4,Great job,"I loved Hamlet, very well done, every character matches the vision and pleasing to watch. I would recommend everyone to watch"
4,Great movie,Watched this for a paper I had to do for an English class and it helped quite a bit. Easier than just reading alone. The acting was great but it has Kenneth Branagh so you can't expect less.
5,Outstanding! Visually stunning,"Kenneth Branagh has proved beyond a doubt that he is not only the greatest Shakesperian actor of our time but also a brilliant director of the same's works. (See Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing). The sets are stunning and the music enhances the action probably beyond what the bard himself could have imagine.The casting of Branagh regulars, Derek Jacobi as Claudius (narrator in Henry V) Brian Blessed as the ghost of Hamlet (Duke of Exeter in Henry V) is amazing. To top that off he adds Billy Crystol as the grave digger, Robin Williams as the fop Osric, Laetes second in the duel, and Depardeau as Polonius's servent are splendid.It's hard to believe that a 4 hour movie can so completely absorb you but this one does."
1,Poorly designed piece of junk,"I bought this charger at approximately 11:00am in the morning. Popped two batteries in it. By 6:30pm they still were not charged!! TWO batteries. I played with it a little and just decided to take it back. Come on, it should be able to charge two batteries in six or seven hours. I have a SONY charger that works far better. I also didn't like the design. The green light is on when it ISN'T charged?? Most charger lights start out red and then turn green when fully charged. This one starts out green and supposedly the light turns off when fully charged [although it never reached that point.] I don't like that. I want to know that power is going into the charger. You could plug this thing into a dead outlet to check your batteries and think the batteries were fully charged [because there was no indicator light on, which equals fully charged.] The whole thing seems flimsy. Anyway - it never worked for me."
4,Value for money,The product is in good shape. Got good value for money. The shipping was fast and services good. Good buy overall.
4,perfect choice,"Perfect, no need to worry about your camera's battery. Very easy to use, plus you can use at car or home"
1,I'll never buy another Energizer!,"Not only it took many hours to charge, the battery life diminished significantly after a few re-charge. To make things worst, the batteries would lose their power over time, even if you don't use it! I'm serious! I even bought 2 new sets (AA & AAA) of Energizer rechareable batteries, and they still have the same problem. Yes, you might think that I've gotten a ""lemon"" charger, but if you want to take the risk with this kind of ""quality control"" then go ahead."
4,read the name of product before buying!,Ok so i purchased this to charge all my batteries. As it says clearly - Energizer e2 Charger for AA & AAA Rechargeable Batteries with Car and Home Adapter & 4 AA Batteries.However it only charges AA not AAA be aware amazon has mis marked this product!
5,Great Product!,"I bought these batteries for my digital camera and they work great. High consumption digital devices can cost you a lot of money in batteries, and throwing batteries away is terrible for the environment. With these rechargable batteries not only can you save some money in the long run, but you'll also be doing your part for mother earth. Highly recommended."
3,Helpful,"The guidebook is helpful, but not among the best efforts from Lonely Planet. Good Patagonia information is hard to find, and so I was glad to have it anyway."
4,The Last House in the Woods.,"Basically a somewhat serious, psychological story of an insane family of murderer-cannibals and a number of their victims. Sometimes, ridiculously over-dramatic, but it has staying power. I'm upset!I hear the english dubbing isn't so great, but I watched it today in italian, (with subtitles), so I wouldn't know. The Ghosthouse Underground DVD gives you a choice.Not the most mature work in the world, but very sick and unusual. Also, considerably more depressing then most of the gaillos and 70's horror movies that the filmmakers say inspired it. Silly in a sense, but it really goes all out. Kind of a combination of a junk horror movie and what a particularly, emotional Tennessee Williams play might seem like on drugs.Not without merit. Also, not a good movie for little kids."
3,Cheap hommage to 80s Giallos,"Simple, straight story, very gory scenes, some bad acting, soso score: ""Efficient"" in every sense but not always effective hommage to 80s maestros. The torture movie Fulci would have made if he'd be still alive and had the budget. The english audio sounds very cheap, badly acted and makes it laughable at times. The subtitles should have been proofread. The well done gore effects make it worth watching for those of us who appreciate that. Everybody else: Stay outta woods."
4,Family Dinner...,"If you enjoy the gooshier works of Lucio Fulci (ZOMBIE, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE BEYOND, HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY), or any cannibal classics like CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE, then you should love THE LAST HOUSE IN THE WOODS! It's a true homage / throwback film loaded w/ blood, unraveling intestines, and a chaotic sense of insanity! Don't expect an art film! This is a squishy splatter extrava-gonzo! Recommended for entrail enthusiasts only..."
4,Goriest movies in awhile,"i love horror movies, and the gorier the better. only gave it 4 stars b/c the voiceover maybe and/or acting leaves something to be desired. worth the money and definately had some moments where your like no they wont....then they do."
2,"GORE, GORE AND MORE GORE-THAT'S ALL","An Italian Dario Argento knock-off but without Argentos' style and talent.The flimsy plot is just an excuse for amputations, dis-embowelments,throat cutting, shots to the head, knifings and a 8 year old cannibal. And a couple of Italian, deformed, redneck mongoloids(also cannibals).I rated this junk 2 stars because it succeeded in its intentions to be over the top gory and gross-but the movie is crap.Body count-12 viewer 0"
1,Stupid...just plain stupid!,"Im sorry to the seller I ordered this movie from. Yall did a great job in getting the movie to me immediately and as described and I hate to ruin future business with good people but the movie was total crap. I tend to think ""well might as well buy it for the price I can rent it"" well I wish I had never seen this movie on the list at all. Terrible scripting, Terrible acting, terrible camera, terrible storyline!!! Had a couple of gory scenes if you like a movie just for that, but I would definately recommend not buying/renting this movie. Out of everything I ordered at one time this is what I was mostly excited about seeing but all copies of this need to be buried somewhere way ""underground"" and far far away I think."
1,Last Movie On the Shelf,"I wouldn't watch this garbage again if it was the last movie on the shelf! I like independent horror movies, but this is just plain LOUSY! I don't know how in the world it garnered 5 stars.The production value is non-existent. It looks like it was filmed by some high school kids who had nothing better to do and sure didn't know what they were doing.The story is equally as bad. I got the impression they were writing this as they were filming.The acting? What acting.And the special effects, well, yes, there's a bunch of red stuff spilled and the chopped off limbs are gory, but they look like someone just went to one of those haunted houses you pay to go through at Halloween and filmed there. Shoddy, shoddy, shoddy.Needless to say, in my humble opinion, this movie sucks big time. What a total waste of money and time."
4,This is the edition to get,"The original vinyl version (and other CDs) was always a bit misleadingly named, since only the first two tracks on those were from the 1973 Roundhouse show as billed.This expanded CD release of the Roundhouse show is now clearly the one to get. The 1973 show is now presented in full over two discs, in proper sequence. (The studio tracks on the older editions are missing here but can now be found on the ""Unidentified Flying Abstract"" archival album.)"
1,Unhappy with the product/service,"I received my costume a couple of days before Halloween. The bag it was in indicated that it was size 2-4, but the actual product was size 24 months. I sent an email and called right away, and never heard back from the company. Because it was so close to Halloween and I didn't have time to exchange it we used the shell and had to buy something else to wear with it. I still have never heard from the company and won't buy from them again."
2,Pink SLVR Motorola Cell Phone,I shouldn't have bought a used cell phone. The seller said it was in very good condition. It was not.
1,Gene Watson DVD,I love Gene Watson but the mixing quality is very poor and the last three or four songs are by some woman I have never heard of and there is no mention of it in the product advertisement. A poor investment.
2,Not up to Gene Watson's standard,"This video smacks of someone having the rights to the video and putting it out on DVD to make a quick buck. Don't be fooled by the recent pictures on the cover of the DVD. The footage is very old; I would say the early 80's based upon the clothes styles. The editing of the video is very amateurish, often breaking in a few notes after the songs have started. I suspect the sound is in mono. The 4 songs by ""special guest"" Denice Price at the end appear tacked on just to add to the run time. Despite this, the quality of Gene's voice does come shining through. Gene Watson is arguably the best pure singer in country music. He deserves better than this DVD."
1,Ridiculous book,"If you want a book that shows you amateur pictures of t---'s, than this is the book. If not, then don't waste your money. A friend of mine, gave me this book and I should have choked her instead of thank her. The silly book is for readers with minds the size of peanuts, it talks about the different sizes and shapes of breasts, but with no sense or meaning. It's just a book about breasts, nothing informative and certainly nothing educational."
4,A true adventurer in every sense of the word,"One of the few books I started reading and could not put down, John Goddard is a true adventurer in the spirit of the word and his book ""The Survivor"" is a top notch recollection of many of his experiences. I remember being a young kid in school and looking forward to the days when John would speak in our auditorium, as his recital of the adventures he's been on would fuel the spark of travel in me which lives on today. You will not be disappointed in this book."
5,Excellent realism and creativity,"The artwork is amazing. The best part for most I'm sure is her step by step instructions to create this work. She gives you instruction on her techniques that you could use on not just the work in the book but for your own work, based on your own reference material. It is realism at its best.It is not for the beginner, you should be confident in your drawing skills, not just tracing or linework. You should know tonal value and be able to create the illusion of 3D...the better your drawings the better chance you have at succeeding with the techniques in the book."
5,"Impressive, Fascinating, Instructional","I bought this book because the front cover captured my attention, and because I have an interest in this type of mixed media process. Sueelen Ross gives detailed instructions and includes examples of her process for many of her paintings. She also reveals her choice of specific pencils, inks, colored pencils and watercolors, including brand names and precise color names. I enjoyed the amazing pictures as well as the information, and I am quite pleased to have purchased the book. It is obvious that Ross loves cats, but she also paints other subjects. I usually buy this type of book, flip through the pages and put it on the shelf to use sometime in the future. When I received this book, I read practically the entire book, studying and enjoying every page. Get the book for the pictures alone, but you will also enjoy and appreciate the author's personality and generosity. Her book is a gift of herself. Thank you Suellen Ross."
2,Misleading Title,"Although the artist, Sueellen Ross, is very talented, I was disapointed with the book. It's title should say ""Paint Radiant Realistic Animals"" or something similar because thats all you get. I was hoping for a variety of subjects, like scenery, buildings, still lifes etc, but it's all animals. An excellent book if you want to paint animals, especiialy cats and dogs. Definatley not what I wanted though. I'll be returning mine!"
5,Very good book,This is a very informative book excellent illustrations. Very complete instructions. Good for beginner or experienced alike. I would highly recomend.
5,"Great price, exactly what I needed",This book was offered at agreat price and was exactly what I needed. I will always check for more from Amazon.
5,Another Tierney triumph!,"How does Mr. Tierney do it? I have yet to be disappointed with ANY of the collections of paper dolls that he has illustrated, and this one is no different. He has captured the nobility of the doomed Tsar, and the regal beauty of his Tsarina. He has not neglected any detail in costume and brings these tragic figures to life again in this collection. A must for history buffs, fashion afficianadoes and those who love well done paper dolls."
5,Review by a 13-Year old Romanov buff,This was a beautifully drawn and colored book and had excellent colors and selections!It was fun to cut out to!!I recommend this book to any one who likes the Romanovs or OTMA!!
1,Would have been nice if i actually got the book.,These folks are really crooked. They tried to sell and charge me for a product they didn't have in stock.
2,Waste of money!!,"As with her first book, I was dissappointed. There is little quality in this book when it comes to GBP. While there is information in there about some struggles and what it was like for her, the ""meat"" of the book was about her posing in playboy, and being in love. The crude language remained, although it was not as bad as her first book, ""Gut Feelings."" I was going to sell these on eBay, but I think I will just give them away!"
4,If you are looking for a personal and inspirational story...,"Let me say this. I love Carnie Wilson . I am inspired by Carnie Wilson. ""I'm Still Hungry"" is an extremely personal account of Carnie's successful weight-loss surgery. She tells it like it is. You have a great sense of her effusive personality. She is definitely an entertainer. She provides valuable information about what to expect after. I am however, a little suprised that her co-author did not restrain her unvarnished praise of her husband (the most talented musician the world, cutest most amazing...you get it). Long before there was Rob, there was Carnie..a beautiful talented woman, at any size. The book reads almost like a journal and is a great change for those people who are exploring Weight Loss Surgery. With great detail, but in approachable language, Carnie Soars..."
2,so so,"I really enjoyed reading about Carnie's experience because I have also had WLS. She offers great ideas, although I caution you that one should always talk to his/her own Dr. and not just taking her advice. Anyway, my complaint with her book is that she is sooooo inlove and sooooo happy all the time. It seems as if this was a panacea. Yes, I am happy and I have had great results from WLS, but it isn't all peaches and cream. In fact, there are many days that I don't even want to face the world. She seems to glamorize the surgery too much and she talks about her wonderful, fantastic, amazing husband too much! Enough already- we get it you're happy!"
3,Carnie makes me laugh....,"Carnie Wilson always entertains. I enjoy her outlook on life and always am entertained when I see her, read her works, watch her reality shows or listen to her music. This book talks about her life after the WLS. It was years ago and we know she gains the weight back and has another surgery, but I enjoyed the read."
1,What a disappointment,"This was to be a replacement for my current Leighton umbrella which has performed well for over 12 years. I had to send this one back because the shaft did not collapse easily; it was nearly impossible to fold up the umbrella and tuck it into its protective sleeve; and the knob cut into my hand. Additionally, the fabric seemed a bit flimsy and the umbrella was wobbly when I held it. On a positive note, the umbrella is lightweight and the peacock print is cheery. However, I'm left to wonder if Leighton is cutting corners."
1,Bad Purchase,"I LOVED the pattern on this umbrella so I was very excited for it to arrive.Even for a mini umbrella it is cheaply made.The material is very thin so the only time this umbrella would be useful is in a very very light rain. If a gust of wind came suddenly, no more umbrella!The metal frame is extremely weak.Even an umbrella hat is made tougher!I am so sorry I wasted the money! I was going to send it back but calculating the price it just wouldn't be worth it! I would be spending as much to return it as I did to receive it which in total is equal to the amount of the darn umbrella!Go for a better brand!!"
2,My Ulu knife,"When the knife arrived it had two nicks in the cutting edge of the blade. It appeared to have been stressed somewhat.Alaskan Ulu, Legendary Knife of the Arctic"
4,The Ulu,I have only my left hand and it has become arthritic. I can still flex my wrist easily and that motion makes this knife shine. I can easily cut up meat and vegetable without excessive discomfort. It was very sharp upon arrival. I keep it sharp with an electric knife sharpener.
2,Only two things in this worth liking,"There are only two things I like about this movie. One is Donald Pleasence as Doctor Sam Looomis. He's become like Captain Ahab in that he's still wants to catch that elusive white whale. Or in this case, a white masked killer whom has consumed his life. The other thing are the two cops who act as a kinda comic relief. Pity they bite the dust. Other than that, this movie is hardly worth the effort. Especially the little plot hole of having a different house for the Michael's old home from the first two movies."
3,?What? Surely they could create something better than this?,"Halloween 5, in a couple words, could've been better, a lot better. This movie has its scary parts but nothing like I and II. Not a lot of gore either.Scariness - 8/10Sound - 7.5/10Acting - 8/10Gore - 7.8/10If you are just looking for a slasher, get Jason or something, but if you really like Halloween $18 isn't too much to ask."
3,halloween movies are the only decent horror sequels,"this is probabley the only halloween im not keen on but i give it 3 stars and i also think that this is better than any of the nightmare on elm streets friday 13ths or hellraisers.little jamie lloyd is now in a home and now has telapathic bonds with her uncle -michael myers!! so dr loomis -michaels phsychiatrist can track him down.1 year after the 4th instalment and michael is again back not as good this time if you want to se better of him watch 1,2 h20 or resurrection they are top this is not dissapointing its good horror its what ud expect of a horror and it does make you jump and is worth watching."
5,fantastic sequal,WELL I DO HAVE TO ADMIT THIS SEQUAL IS PROBEBLY ONLY GOING TO BE GOOD AND UNDERDTANDING IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE PREVIOS MOVIES.ANYWAY SET AFTER 4 {THIS IS MUCH BETTER BUY THE WAY} HIS NEICE JAMIE IS NOW SENSING HIM AND KNOWS WHEN HE ATTACTS.SOME MORE FANTASTIC DEATHS MAKE FOR A LOVE/HATE SEQUALDVD INCLUDES:THEATRICAL TRAILERINSIDE HALLOWEEN 5 DOCUMENTARYSCENE SELECTION
5,Michael's still alive and kill'in!,Well what can I say this movie is awsome.there are only 3 bad things 1st.Michael's mask is differint. The myers house is differint and That shadowy figure kicked the little dog.yeah.And I was mildly ammused when Jamie stopped Michael so easly and others (such as the good docter) can shoot him stab him what ever. well all in all I say this movie is great so go buy it or the boogieman will pitch fork ya.sweet dreams.
2,Not quite as good,"Set one year after ""Halloween 4"", Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is in a children's psychiatric hospital, and she seems to have a psychic connection to her uncle Michael Myers. On hand is Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), who wants Jamie to reveal where Michael is. But for some reason Jamie can't speak, and Loomis wants to use her as bait to trap Myers. That sets the tone for the rest of the film, which isn't saying much: Myer's mask looks too different, routine unimaginative murders, no real scares, and the introduction of a subplot involving a mysterious man dressed in black that goes nowhere. The Myers house here (as in ""Halloween 4"") is completely different than in the first two films. Points taken off for the death of plucky Rachel (Ellie Cornell) early in the film. The ending is unsatisfactory, and doesn't really take us anywhere. Thank God this series was rescued nine years later with ""Halloween H20""."
1,Ticked off completely,"This Halloween is kind of to like of 2 other Halloweens films 4 and 6 the Jamie trilogy 1,2,7,8 are the laurie quadrility halloween 3 (Did somebody yell flop) back to 5 I saw it once and I could tell Pleasense was in it for the money the teenagers were in it to lose there virginity Harris was actually the only one in the movie doing it for the movies sake the directer Dominoei,maforeignfaggot probably could,nt speak english thats why its so awful as for the story Z the shape comes back to kill people and whos the guy in the clickey cowboy shoes is he are gun slingin' cowboy hero no he lets micheal out of jail what the f*** is up with that two words for this halloweenies ooh scary i'm being sarcastic of course"
3,Not too bad sequel!,"A year after ""Halloween 4"", Jamie (Danielle Harris) is traumatized and is sent to a children's hospital for treatment but what they don't know is that she has a special telepathic link with her uncle Michael whom she thought was dead last time. Michael returns to Haddonfield for more murderous mayhem and to destroy her neice, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) returns as well to confront the hellish phantom.Some say it's one of the worst entries of the series with part 3, 6 and Resurrection but i don't think it really is. I thought this was a fun mindless sequel with some good splatter effects by KNB Efx (the company that did ""Hostel"" and ""Kill Bill"") and has a good storyline to it, it's not as good as the first, second, fourth and H2O but it's still an enjoyable entry in it's own right.This Divamax special edition DVD has excellent picture and sound quality with some nifty extras like audio commentary, an introduction, two featurettes and the theatrical trailer."
4,"Her uncle is the ""Boogeyman""!!!","I really enjoy all of the Halloween movies, even the sequals. This one brought in plenty of perky young teenagers and rookie cops to mutilate. Some of the death scenes are really quite scary, and the actress who plays Jamie, and the dependable Dr. Loomis really carry this moive. I still get chills when I what this in late autumn, alone in the house, jack'o'laterns lit."
4,Donald Pleasence is awsome,For me there is nothing better than watching Donald Pleasence as Loomis. He's after a mad man or evil force whatever you want to call it and he seems like hes on the brink of insanity himself. The poor kids probably freaked out more by him than she is Micheal. Although he doesn't have any great stabbing scences. Pitchforks add the excitment of 4 times the stabbing in this movie. GGGGOOOOOOOOODDDDD stuff
4,Good and Scary,"I rented this movie and I was a little spooked, its just the way he killed people in this one, and maybe his mask was a little bit scary.If u a Halloween fan get this one, this one is worth watching. But dont let your kids watch this one."
2,"""Don't waste your money...""","Halloween 5 is very ..., and the ending was extremely stupid. The little girl, Jamie, was overall annoying and there is no Jamie Lee Curtis. You don't see Michael's face either, and Donald Pleasence sounded like an old fart on his death bed. Michael killed hardly any people, he just snuck around in their houses and watched 'em, he barely did anything. Try H20 or the original Halloween, don't waste your money on this junk."
2,"Halloween 5 is An ""ehh"" kind of movie",This movie was a major dissapointment to me. The gore and stuff is fine it's just that the characters are soooooooo annoying! Rent this movie before you buy it!...
1,This is not the complete movie as seen in the theater,"I would have given this a higher rating...however I remember when this movie came out in the theaters. To avoid giving away any spoilers, let's just say if you've seen the movie in the theaters and then on video, you know exactly what is missing. And those missing elements, IMHO, gives the video version a much different tone than the theatrical version. I've never been a big fan of any video that has been cut down without informing the viewer as such (hence the rating, my own pet peeve mind you). I have no idea why this was released on video edited...if anyone can tell me, I'd be happy."
3,"""Halloween 5: the Revenge of Michael Myers"" (USA 1989)","""Halloween 5: the Revenge of Michael Myers"" is definately a 'popcorn-pulling' movie, filmed as a follow-up to Dwight H Little's ""Halloween 4"". ""5"" is not as good as its predecessor, and plays like a TV movie. Dominique Othenin-Girard tries to resurrect every possible way of keeping Michael alive for just a couple more million dollars and a couple more movies. Not bad, but ""1"", ""2"", ""4"", ""6"" and ""H:20"" beat it hands down."
2,H2O BETTER,"Besides H20, Halloween 5 is the only other Halooween movie I've seen. I like the idea of Mike having a niece, but it was just too low on gore. Those who are fans of the original I recommend that you set this title a side."
2,Worst of the lot,"This film was so wrong on many different levels! How did the Myers home become a gothic mansion? What happened to Michael's mask??? It looked absolutely ridiculous, not to mention it doesn't even match the one positioned on the box cover! The supporting characters are dreadful and you pray for their demise, in particular Tina. Oh & did I mention the doof cops named Freddy & Jason? Moan inducing, indeed!"
1,Dr. Loomis (and Moustapha Akkad) goes insane.,"Nothing beats the original Michael-kills-sister plot line, but 4 was plausable. We accepted that Laurie Strode had a daughter and then died. But what we cannot accept is this film. Dr. Loomis, the man who desperately wants to stop Michael, is conveyed as a lunatic himself in this film. Danielle Harris, who was remarkable in 4, is now reduced to a ""mute"" with no acting style what-so-ever. As for the rest of the cast, should I even mention the Barney Fife wannabe cops? I'm sure another reviewer will. Overall, the worst of the series."
4,HALLOWEEN 5- THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS,"I THINK THE MOVIE WANS OK. BUT NOT AS GOOD AS #4. THE ACTORS THAT SURVIED FROM 4 WERE VERY WEAK IN THIS FILM, WHICH MADE IT NOT AS GOOD. BUT HELL I STILL LIKE TO WATCH IT EVERY CANCE I CAN!"
2,PLEASE STOP COMING HOME!,"After a fairly good entry in the series, we come to 'Halloween 5 The Revenge Of Michael Myers'! This is probably the worst in the series right behind part 6. There are just too many plot holes and the whole thing feels really contrived(even for this type of film!). The sequels don't compare to the original and this one is really confusing and boring at times! It still delivers some shock value here and there, but nothing we haven't seen before. The film transfer is very good though and if your a fan of the series......."
1,Don't even attempt to see this one,"This movie is even worse than number four. Take my advice and stick with the true Halloween trilogy: 1, 2, and 7."
1,Awful,"There are three main characters in this movie:1) A little girl in a hospital bed who is constantly going into spasmodic seizures. Oh, the joy of watching this.2) Loomis, acting like a certified paranoid schizophrenic. Oh, the joy of watching this.3) Some teenage girl who obviously did so much coke before filming each scene that she's almost literally climbing up the walls. Oh, the joy...Other than that, some guy in a silly mask walks around doing an imitation of Data from Star Trek. Apparently this is supposed to be scary? I can't quite imagine how.Skip this one and get just about any other slasher ever made instead."
2,"Without Ellie Cornell, this movie sucks","The only realistic written, likable and well acted character in Halloween 4, 5, or 6 is that of Ellie Cornell's Rachel. She made Halloween 4 and gets killed a half hour into Halloween 5. What were these people thinking. Yeah, I'd really rather watch a mute pre-teen dressed as a cicus clown and an old man who overacts battle the bad guy. What market research did they pay for to come to that conclusion. Overall, the plot is slow and the movie tiresome. Check out 1,2,4, or H20 for anything worthwhile.With any luck, Ellie Cornell will be resurrected."
4,Entertaining sequel,"I liked this sequel. It was a little bit of an upgrade from Halloween 4 which was an excellent movie. Carpenter certainly knows how to write the storylines. If I had to say one thing about this film, it is what we see in HALLOWEEN H20 which shows it's faults. It seems when you watch the most recent Halloween movie that Hallween 3- 6 never even happened!"
3,Michael Myers Needs A Break,"I am not quite sure what the point of this movie was. I did not mind Halloween 4 at all but what is this? You will rarely ever hear me say something negative about Halloween, but Halloween 5 was not a good movie. First of all, they kill one of the main characters from Halloween 4 right off the bat. They continue by trying to add comedy into the movie by having two very retarded cops on the scene. The acting does not get any better when we have to put up with young Danielle Harris trying to act like she cannot even talk due to the trauma she has suffered from her Uncle Michael. Just wait for Halloween 6 Jamie Lloyd. Donald Pleasence, once again, seems to be the only one who truly knows what he is doing. Thank god Dr. Loomis can't die. By the way, why do they feel that they have to change Michael Myers' mask each time a new Halloween movie is released?"
1,THIS IS STRAIGHT UP GARBAGE!,"MICHAEL MYERS IS ABOUT TO STRIKE AGAIN AND MICHAEL'S NIECE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN STOP HIM. EVEN THOUGH DONALD PLEASANCE IS BACK ONCE AGAIN AS DR. LOOMIS, HE CAN DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SAVE THIS MOVIE FROM BEING A WASTE OF TIME. IT JUST SIMPLY HAS BORING MURDERS AND A VERY WEAK STORY. GOD, SAVE US ALL!"
2,The Revenge of making a good Halloween film.,"What happened? This film saga was good until this one came out. I admit it was decent, but thats no excuse for bad acting, bad storyline, and no jump or frightening scenes at all. The story is boring in a way. Michael returns after jaime when shes in a mental asylum. This film was poorly made and poorly written, and the characters are so bad you dont care if they die. This is by far the worst in the series. I only liked it because of some deaths were cool. But this is my own opinion and i still think its worth to rent."
2,Halloween 5 ... Good Film! Bad Afterwards!,"""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" is a fair film. It was good the first time I watched it, but it the other times I watched it, it was boring! That is the reason it gets 2 Stars is for a low re-watchability factor! The film itself is a great contiuation from ""Halloween 4: TRoMM"" where this film picks up one year later after ""Halloween 4"" where Michael (Donald L. Shanks) has been rehabilitated by a hermit in the woods and comes back to Haddonfield, once again after his little niece Jamie (Danielle Harris). Contains - Gory Violence, Language, and Adult Situations. DVD - 4/5 - Good DVD with the works! Good treatment DVD wise to a forgotten sequel. If only Anchor Bay could've done the same to ""Halloween 4""."
3,Halloween 5- Limited Edition Tin,"Halloween 5 had just been released in a Limited Edition Tin. The package is nice but the Picture is quite bad.It is not as clear as the one Anchor Bay Released for Halloween last year. Extras is not really much, the deleted scene is no good.I am quite surprise that they did not remaster the film and there is only one trailer included which is too little !!!!"
4,It is about time...Michael is DEAD!!!,"Michael Myers takes off his mask, and is burnt to a crisp with a bunch of police. But is it over??? No way. We've just began. This was one of my favorite Halloween movie. Michael never gives up. He is still chasing his neice. If he gets her, well I aint telling you. Buy it. Another bloodbath succedded, by Michael Myers. More deaths to come. But Save it For the Sequel."
1,A stinker,Well everyone the only revenge Michael gets is on his fans. I must say that as much of a fan that i am of the Halloween films (especially the first 2)-this one stinks. This one had neither creative characters or a decent script. By the way what did they do to the Myers house in this one!!!
2,"H5: Don't believe the hype, it's not that good.","Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers is a flick that has begun to exhaust the Michael Myers angle...While I felt that H4 was well done and an intelligent horror flick, H5 seemed boring at times and the storyline could've been a lot better...the apparent ""psychic link"" between Myers and his niece was cheesy; it brought down the entire Halloween series from a horror icon to a Friday the 13th-like slasher series...If you haven't seen any Halloween flicks, than I'd advise you to see the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and then not expect too much from the final 3, although H20 was better than it's two predecessors."
3,Some info on the LE and the normal version,"Just so you know the LE will come with the tin case and a booklet, other than that the 2 DVDs are the same thing. The LE contains the indentical disc the other version has in it. I personally ordered the normal version because they're hard to fit in with the rest of the set. I just wanted to let everyone know that they are the same disc so don't be fooled and order the LE for more money if you don't care about the tin case and booklet."
3,Just a sequel,"This is the continuation of the 4th Halloween movie. Thought it takes place one year after the events in that movie. This one has Michael still persuing his young neice in a effort to kill her. This act will complete the total slaughter of his entire family. Personally this series should have ended in 1981 with the 2nd movie. I do feel it warranted a 2nd, but not the rest that followed. Maybe the 7th. that was pretty good. 1,2,7...that is the order you should watch these movies...forget 3 (nothing to do with anything michael myers anyways) 4 & 5 are just sequels and 6 doesn't explain a damn thing...."
1,"If Michael was dumb before, I have no comments here.","If you read my review for Halloween 4 : The Return Of Michael Myers, you have a very good idea of what I think about this fifth part. If you didn't read it yet, go read it, because if I say something about this movie...well... One more thing, Michael WAS dumb in Halloween 4, here he is pathtetic !"
1,Disgustingly bad.,Deemed as the worst Halloween film ever! Here are some of it's faults: 1. Too violent. The Halloween films (1 and 4 at least) are supposed to be tame. 2. Not scary or suspenseful.
3,Pretty much on par with Halloween 4,"Picking up right after Halloween 4 left off, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers finds our favorite psycho once again after his young niece. Donald Pleasence is back (yet again) as Dr. Loomis and is his usually great self, but the rest of the cast is plain 'ol bland and boring, and in the end your rooting for Michael to hack and slash them all away. Halloween 4 was at least a bit memorable thanks to it's surprise ending, but this installment just like the previous, is notably missing any of creator John Carpenter's stylistic creativity. This installment also introduces us to the ""mysterious"" man in black whose identity would be revealed in the next (and undoubtadly one of the worst in the series) Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. All in all, Halloween 5 is hardly the worst in the long running slasher series, but your better off sticking with the original classic film."
3,"HALLOWEEN 5 IS 5 TIMES BETTER THAN PARTS 2,3,H2O.","The HALLOWEEN films are alright but some are tiresome like the worst series parts 2,3,and H2O.and the best series are parts 1,4,5,6,and RESURRECTION.this one opens with a plot but gets far from the plot when Michael kills teens and then goes after his neice who's in a clinic for the traumatized.the man in black thing is too silly and unneeded and Michael's mask was terrible and silly.the funniest parts come from when Michael kills the teens in a barn,throws Dr.Loomis off the stairail,and then punctures holes in the laundry shoute and tries to kill his neice and in the laundry shoute then looks up the laundry shoute in his mask is hilarious.more funny than scary.Rated R for graphic violence/gore,language,and some sexuality."
1,The worst movie in the series,"michael myers is still trying to kill his young neice,like in Halloween 4,but not as good as Halloween 4.This ones a stinker,stay away from this one.Boring!"
5,A Great movie!,"I don't see why people think that this is the worst movie with Michael Myers. I really liked it. People say that they hate it because of his mask. You don't really notice how bad the mask looks like throughout the film. The killings were great. And Donald Pleasence did a great job acting. I suggest you rent or buy this movie, but after you've seen the 4th one."
4,Good except for one thing,"This is a good movie. I like it about the same as part 4. But I don't care for Michael's mask. Like part 4, it doesn't measure up to the original. The only good thing is that the sideburns mysteriously disappeared."
2,Michael's back once again.,"Picking up right from Halloween 4, Halloween 5 was one of the last '80s slasher films and its got high standards of horror. Michael Myers' mask in here is really cool. It looks a little less cheaper than in 4. The mask is still not as good as in 1 and 2. The mask got better in Halloween 6 and Halloween H20. Still the mask is cool. The mysterious Man in Black shows up, and the film is very mysterious with a very mysterious ending. The John Carpenter feel is pretty much lost, but Michael gives us some gruesome deaths and some exciting moments. Still, not as atmospheric or entertaining as Friday the 13th films. Halloween 6 is a little more gruesome and entertaining, and I liked it better, it does bring a lot of things to friction, and Halloween H20 creates some great moments for Michael, but in an atmosphere that ignores 4-6."
1,Blah.,"I can't be bothered to write out a full review for this. I can't summarize the plot, because there really isn't much of one. Michael wakes up a year after the events of Halloween 4 and begins stalking his niece, Jamie, again. That's it.A mind-bogglingly pointless film, even Donald Pleasance (who doesn't look at all happy to be there) couldn't save this trash."
5,liz,wow what a great come back of micheal meyers. I love the fact that i was able to purchase my halloween collection at such a great price at Amozon.com.
1,terrible movie,I have to say that this movie wasnt even worth renting. Proably the worst horror movie Ive ever seen and I dont throw that around lightly. Cheesy as hell.
2,NOT GREAT,This is probably my least favorite Halloween movie (next to 3 of corse)but you should still see it if youre a big fan of the series. RATED R:FOR STRONG VIOLENCE AND LANGUGE AND FOR SOME SEXUALITY
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE. MICHAEL MYERS AINT JASON VORHEES, HE IS A KNIFE WIELDING FREAK THEY MAKE HIM USE HUGE AXES CMON HE USES KNIFES. AND WHO IS THAT GUY DRESSED IN BLACK ITS STUPID. THE ENDING WAS TERRIBLE, WHAT AM I SAYING THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE."
3,Worst Halloween entry,"Halloween is the best movie franchise but this movie is weak. The characters seemed to be rushed in from other movies from the time like Friday the 13th. I was watching Halloween 25 Years Later and they even admited this movie was rushed too quickly. Anther problem was Michaels mask. TUCK IT IN! It looks like the actor inside the suit didnt want to wear a mask, so he put it on loosely as possible. A few cool death scenes but other then that, this movie is probably the worst of the series."
2,"""Very boring, probably the worst in the series...""","Even though our masked anti-hero, Michael Myers, is in this one quite a lot, this was still boring on so many levels. For one, no Jamie Lee Curtis, two, you don't really see his face. I could go on forever. Donald Pleasence wasn't very good at Dr. Loomis this time, he sounded like he was losing his voice, so I'm guessing they made him play the part while he had a cold. And I got so sick of Michael's neice, Jamie, going nuts every time Michael is about to kill someone, and it...it was just so boring that I stopped it three times. Take my advice folks, don't see this one. Go for such films as Halloween:H20, Jason X, and the original A Nightmare on Elm Street."
3,Still a big mistake,Every time I see this movie there is a mistake. The mansion.Not to mention the set light that wasn't hidden.
3,Pretty cool and freaky movie,"This movie was very cool, but the only problem was it seemed like it took way to long to finish. I probably would'nt like it to much if Myers was'nt in it though"
3,he wont go away!,"michael myers is one of my favorite horror villains, but the character is getting boring. just as in 4, he is after his neice, killing off everyone in his path (what a suprise). there is gore galore and it is halloween, so i give it three stars. fans of the series will like it, others will not."
1,"Pure and simple, a sequel for nothing more than more money","The whole pawn of a cult plot is ludicrous and totally takes away the element of evil started and ENDED in parts 1 and 2. Michael's niece having a mind connection with him? Give me a break. They just needed to find some way to keep digging up ole Michael to milk more money from his image and name. Unfortunately, they made another one after this one."
3,Has Several Needs,"The Director of this Film required too much unnecessary blood and gore although there doesn't seem to be that much for this day in age.His strategy for the film was not the best one.The loose ends left at the end of this film would make it hard to create a good 6th film,which did seem quite impressive from its original version until most of it was reshot nd edited badly.All and All,the main problem of this film was it being rushed into production.They should've atleast waited two years bfore the 5th installment."
2,Z Grade Slasher Fare,"This is even more predictable than the fourth Halloween film, but unlike that one's straight stalk and slash fair, this is a further decline into Z grade mania. It reminded me of the third Howling film how they tried to breathe new life into the series, but instead it just seems tired and dated. As entertainment I would give it five stars as a work of art one and a half stars. Michael Meyers' mask was simply a Captain Kirk mask painted white. Only Halloween and other diehard horror fans would want to see this unless you were suckered when this was part of 80s pop culture. Halloween is the best horror series, because they were such predictable stalk and slash films with a lot of hokey suspense. It's so cheesy you can't help but like it. I wouldn't recommend though. If you have to see just one Haloween film I would recommend the sixth entry. So bad...it's Z grade!"
3,Came out to soon...!!,"Halloween producers got a little greedy to quick.Part 4 just came out on video and they released Part 5at the movies.It was kinda like the producers saying you like that,well good lets shove some more down your throat beforeyou can digest part 4.If they would have put more time into making part 5,and waited about a year it probably would have donebetter at the BOX OFFICE.I rate this DVD a 3 of 5 stars!!"
4,"""The second best sequel to the Halloween series""","""Halloween 5"" was the second best to the Halloween series. The best one was ""Halloween H20"". The part when they have sex in the barn was completely unessesary! I mean just blew the story off topic. I was so glad Michael Myers ruined their party! I mean Uh,uh,uh! I just can't stand hearing that!"
3,Halloween 4 refurbished,This is close to the same as the return except new plotline a descent film but this movie is on the bad side of michael myers still is a good slasher movie though.
4,MR. SANDMAN,"Me again. Can't stop writing these things. Anyway I agree that this is one of the best Halloween movies. I mean what the hell were they thinking when they completely went off topic about Michael. He's what started the whole flick!Plus I'm glad he's chasing someone other then Jamie. Don't get me wrong, she's the Queen of Scream Queens, but it's always fun to add other characters."
2,Worst of the series!,Simply put this is the worst Halloween ever. I gave it two stars because over the years it became slighty better. Halloween 3 is way better.
1,The worst of the Halloween Series,"As others have already said, this movie had no intentions but to make money. I mean, why was Michael killing all of these people that were not even in his way of getting to Jamie. Plus at one point, Michael was at the clinic that Jamie was at and decided to go chase Tina to a party. I didn't understand that. I'd reccommend this only so you can see what happens to Michael not because of its meaningless content."
4,great movie,"Much better than Halloween 4 ,scarier and more surprises,Iwould recommend this one 3rd best,a great movie.(grade B+)"
3,"Not Great, But Atleast Scary","Halloween five takes place a year after 4. This movie tells about why Jamie Stabbed Rachael at the end of the halloween 4. Ofcourse Michael Myers is still after her. Dr. Loomis once again returened. If it wasn't Loomis, this movie would be garbage. Anyway, In this movie Dr. Loomis has a love moment with Michael. Also the Myers house in this movie looks like a gothic mansion. the movie overall is not to great but it is one of the scariest of the series. This movie is great for diehard halloween fans. For non-horror i thinks it worth a shot!"
2,Horrific. Horrifying. Horrible,The halloween saga has reached it's lowest poiny ( not including Halloween 3). The movie just wasn't good. No suspense. Rated R for really bad movie.
4,Michael Myers Lives!,"Not the best although much more enjoyable than HALLOWEEN 2. This installment lacked the action of part 4, but it was still good. Michaels mask in this looked a bit pathetic and the way he killed people in this is like the style of Jason from FRIDAY THE 13TH movies. I liked the bit where he takes his mask off and sheds a tear, in a moment of thought. The ending is mysterious and there is also the appearence of a man dressed head to toe in black. Overall a good film which is better than part 2 & 6."
5,He's out for Revenge!,"Halloween 5 is the BEST Halloween film EVER!It was a little bit scary,little bit gore,and a little bit funny.This movie is BETTER than Halloween 4,6,and H20.It shows how he became evil but Halloween 6 tells how he became evil.And for ,probaly,the first time it shows Michael Myers unmasked!If your a Halloween fan GET this movie!It's TWO thumbs up!5 STARS!And it deserve to win a ACADEMY AWARD!Get it or he will get REVENGE on YOU!"
4,WHATS WITH THE SOUND WHEN THE COPS ARE WALKING OUT!,"WHEN DID THE MYERS HOUSE BECOME SOME MANSION?I LIKED THE MOVIE ALOT,BUT THERE WAS SOME DUMB PARTS I'LL SAY.IT JUST WAS'NT A GREAT HALLOWEEN MOVIE IT WAS A GOOD HALLOWEEN MOVIE,AND IM GLAD MIKEY GETS KILLED(SORRY IF I RUINED IT FOR YOU)!"
3,Still good- but nothing special,"Now, after the amazing comeback sequel Halloween 4 I was anticipating that this film would be just as good.Unfortunately I was wrong. I liked this film I must say but what really annoyed me was the plot. Myers is saved by a hermit after falling down the mineshift. He lives with him for a year until Halloween comes again. The Myers house is now a mansion, not a two storey. The plot is slow, Myers killing a lot of innocent teenagers when he could just go out for Jamie anyway. Good movie, so much killing was not needed though."
2,Still Not There Yet,Myers is after his niece yet again. But this time he stalks a bunch seriously annoying teenagers on the way. Really just Halloween 4 with a touch of graphic voilence. Michael seems to be going from a serial killing stalker to a hardcore homicidal maniac.
1,THIS FILM IS BEYOND THE POINT OF STUPIDITY!,Halloween 5 is downright awful. The only plus in the film is when the 2 comic relief cops are killed. This movie would not scare a child. I would pay NOT to see this film again.
3,HALLOWEEN 5 THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MEYERS,"I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time i see it i find a mistake. The sitcom music when the two dumb clumsy cops are introduced,the odd caption and missmatches with Wendy Chaplin. I would have to say like i tell everybody about this movie, it is not very good or original at all. However it is interesting. I find it a fun movie to watch. It (along with 6) is probably the wierdest movie ive ever seen in my life. The man in black really had me wondering. Dr. Loomis just finally i can see lost it. Donald Pleasence is always great though. I didnt like it when Ellie Cornwall was killed of. Then i think of it though. The survivors of 4 (which i liked by the way) the got very weak in 5. Thats why I was disapointed with the acting. thank you for taking the time to read this review."
4,Halloween Colelction,"Movie came fast, dvd quality and completed my Halloween collection. I definitely cannot complain. I love this series and always will!"
3,"Looks great, but missing old extras","Unfortunately, the anchor bay we knew and loved is no more. With their apparent lack of interest in release catalog titles, I'm surprised we even saw this movie (and the part 4 blu for that matter) get released from them. I was thrilled to get them, and believe me, the PQ is great, all things considered, but i hate that they left off extras from their previous divimax releases.Hopefully, one day in the future, we can ultimate editions, so I can retire my old DVDs for good!"
4,Blu brings Michael home.,"The quality of this Blu ray is rather skewed. Because the movie itself isn't the best Myers installment. But as a whole, this Blu ray is better than any DVD release of this title."
2,good ol predictable halloween movie.,"Basically part 5 is just like the previous halloweens, suspensful at times but ruined by a predictable ending that you know is coming but you just sit there and watch it anyways, maybe people just like to see people get stabbed and killed brutally. it's a year later from where part 4 left off, the girl is in some mental hospital, meyers kills about eight people and goes after the girl, the girl fends off meyers for awhile until good ol crusty doctor loomis comes in and shoots meyers with some darts. Meyers is then hauled away to a prison but of course he breaks out at the very end. okay so that was a spoiler but it was so obvious that you would have to be an idiot not to know what was going to happen. one burning question still remains, why dont people just gang up on michael and cut him into pieces, burn the pieces, put the ashes in a jar, and throw the jar into the bottem of a lake?"
3,Could've Been Better,"This movie would have gotten a better review from me if it was a little more realistic. I thought this movie was pretty scary, but what happened to the Myers House? All of a sudden, it's a huge mansion. Michael's mask is kinda funny looking too. ""Halloween"" fans should watch this, but will probably be slightly disappointed."
1,Worst sequel yet,"Halloween was scary, stylish and suspensful. Halloween 5 isn't scary nor suspensful. This is the worst Halloween movie yet besides Halloween 3 which was just stupid. Halloween movies were really scary but this one is just cheesy and annoying. The Halloween series which was once scary, now has to please a new generation who thinks gore is scary. Do not waste your money on buying this piece of crap."
3,Odd.,"This fifth movie in the Halloween series follows events featured in the fourth Hallowween movie. Watching this, one gets the feeling that the franchise is getting old and those at the helm are running out of ideas.Rental only."
3,Average viewing - Nothing special,"The movie itself consists of a down right pathetic and annoying storyline line where little Jamie (Harris) has a telepathic connection with (her uncle) Michael Myers. Poor set pieces also create a problem as they seen fake and completly spoil the atmosphere.The continuity in micheal's mask is terrible also, but there are a few good points such as Alan Howarth's mix of Carpentar's original score and few sub- plots dotted here and there.Overall a unscary and boring attempt at trying to make another ""Halloween"" movie."
2,Umm....lets see....no!,"This one was the worst Halloween for me. I know not many people are going to agree with me, but let me spell it out for you. It's been a while since I've seen this one, but this is the one where Michael and Jamie(the niece) have the almost psychic link, right? That just ruined the whole Halloween feel for me, since when has Michael had ""mind control"" and ""linking powers""? I just liked it better when he was just a crazy guy, seemingly killing for little to no reason(Halloween 1 and 2)"
5,Halloween 5,"This is my favorite Horror movie of all time it has evreything one has and more unlike it's predecessors, Halloween 5 has little Jamie who is able to feel what Michael Myers feels by virtue of being her niece, and strongly connected to her telapathicaly has many similarities to the first one, in the sense that Jamie wears a clown costume in the 5th one which Michael Myers also wears in the first one so the movie reminds me of the first one almost like an off shoot. The movie has thrills gore sex violence what else can you possibly want, you have to see it to believe it."
3,so-so installment of the Halloween franchise,"you can't really talk about H5 without talking about H4, since H5 is really the sequel to H4. I found H5 a bit of a letdown compared to H4; still, there's only one Michael Myers, and it's always good to see him kicking a--.What's missing is Jamie Lee Curtis, who was so good in H1 & H2....she would re-enter the series in H20, where, once again, she is brillant.Speaking of brillance, Donald Pleasence is the glue that holds all these Halloween films together."
4,Not bad at all...,"I know many people think that Halloween 5 is one of the worst entries in the Halloween franchise but I have to disagree. I would have to say that this film is actually one of my favorite Halloweens. Sure it has its problems (the random and pointless change in the Myers house, the overly goofy policemen, and the introduction of the man in black) but it also has plenty of good things (great acting from Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence, the awesome character of Tina - played by Wendy Kaplan, and some truly frightening sequences). I would suggest watching the previous Halloween films beforehand or else you'll be totally lost. If you don't know what happens in Halloween 6, you may feel a little lost and confused by the ending (like I said, this film ain't perfect). But if you're a horror/slasher fan, keep an open mind and just enjoy Halloween 5."
4,Jazz Guy Pick (www.voiceofvashon.org),"""Tethered Moon"" is the rather unfortunate name that bassist Dave Holland, drummer Paul Motian and pianist Masabumi Kikuchi have chosen for their trio. Entirely fortunate, however, is their choice of material. Many of Piaf's songs would appear to be somewhat resistant to the jazz treatment, but this is an absolutely gorgeous album and there are no real missteps here. The music easily rates all five stars, but, unhappily, Kikuchi has developed the habit, shared by Keith Jarrett and Oscar Peterson,among others, of inappropriately (or perhaps involuntarily) vocalising along with the music with a variety of grunts and whines and squeals, none of them pleasant, which are all, however, dutifully recorded and included on the soundtrack as if they were somehow an enhancement. They are not. Without these untoward vocal intrusions this would be an absolutely exquisite trio - dumb name and all."
4,Wiener Dog!,"This movie stars your classic ""nerd"" character. Dawn Wiener is so unpopular, even the teachers turn a blind eye to how mistreated she is. This film is a wonderful dark comedy."
5,just might be a modern-day classic,this is a masterful look at the terrible and wonderful landscape of middle school from a ground zero perspective.It completely drew me in. The director makes it look easy as he assembles and inspires a flawless cast. The flow of the film is exceptional; it is a smooth but continually surprising journey through a rich slice of life. See this film.
5,I love this movie!,"I'm going to keep this as short as possible and just say that this is such a wonderful movie. I've recommended it to friends before and they loved it except now they think I'm a little strange. This movie is sort of a ""dark"" comedy, but Heather Matarazzo and Brendan Sexton are wonderful together!! BUY THIS MOVIE!"
4,A great film,"Like the other Todd Solondz film I watched, 'Happiness', 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' is a film that does not leave you with a sense of happiness after watching it. It is not 'uplifting'. However, it is a film that I and hopefully others will be glad they watched.Like Happiness, this film contained one scene that I found particularly emotive, and serves in one way to illustrate certain 'harsh realities' that are just that; reality. In Welcome to the Dollhouse, this reality is the fact that people often take out their own anger or frustration on others - like the main character, Dawn, does to her best friend.Everyone should watch this film. I hope Solondz's later work will be just as good."
2,Great Film,"This film has a lot of truth, but also is way to far taken at times. Whenever I watch this I feel like the writer has no obvious overview of what it means to be a nerd. The filmed settings are also very dull. I don't recommend buying this film cause you won't enjoy it more than once. I only said the negatives, but there is also a lot of positives. This movies filming is impressive."
4,good movie,i'll keep this short. a definite must-see. subtleties of the film make me suspect that the director is some kind of genius. much better than happiness. drags a bit. great ending.
5,Excellent Commentary on Our Sad Culture,"The acting wasn't great, but it was certainly adequate. Iespecially enjoyed the performance of the older brother (and hisdreadful rock band). Especially sad, of course, is the life of Dawn, who did not choose her looks or background, but must pay emotionally every day for being born into these circumstances. What a couple of years before was a carefree, innocent little girl turns into a cynical and psychologically damaged young lady who will carry the scars of this experience for the rest of her life. This movie is compelling, occasionally humorous, touching and an excellent commentary on the dark side of human nature and our sad culture. Five stars for effort and truth."
3,different,"this movie like the movie happiness is good but not great. the films are engaging, unique and very stylish. but therein lies the problem. i think Solondz gives us style over substance and shock over reality. he is very good at evoking the darker side of human nature but the characters are flat and the problems and scenarios are poorly developed. nevertheless, he has a vision and a talent for portraying provocative ideas and i'm sure he will develop the insight to bring more subtlety, and depth to his ideas."
2,I'd prefer the dollhouse,"This film was touted as a fantastic dark comedy. I got the dark part. I'm still waiting on most of the comedy. It was very well acted and I'd even say finely directed... but something was missing. The plot just did not seem to go anywhere after such a strong setup and such stellar presentation of rich characters. I look forward to seeing where this ensemble goes from here, as everyone in it shone. I just wish the darkness could have shed some light on a plot."
4,quirky look at junior high,I caught this movie on BRAVO the other night. I'm not sure what reaction director Todd Solondz was gunning for; disgust? intrigue? The funniest part of the film was when Dawn runs off to NYC and her family doesn't even realize she's gone. (It seemed as if their sole concern was the youngest daughter). Brendan Sexton gives a good performance as Dawn's loser boyfriend.
5,excellent movie,"Excellent coming-of-age movie. Very realistic portrayal of a girl struggling with bullying, unloving parents, and the beginnings of feelings for the opposite sex."
4,Weird and funny,"I liked this movie. It was odd and strangely violent. The main character is doomed to go through middle school alone. There seems to be no hope in sight, and high school will probably be just as bad.That's the message I got out of it, which was rather depressing. I don't know; maybe I was hoping for something deeper? Or maybe this film just set out deliberately to be this way, to emphasize the emptiness that comes with suburban adolescence.The film came close to being scandalous to me, but not quite. I just wish its outlook wasn't so despondent.Great acting from the star. And yes, the main song is quite catchy."
1,Don't waste two hours of your life!,"""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" was hands down the worst movie I have ever seen! It was depressing (but not in a heart-felt way), unrealistic and just plain awful! I would not recommend that anyone spend money or time on this piece of garbage!"
1,You call this funny?,"A friend and I rented this, and then sat as our terriblefeelings of insecurity and childhood traumas were played out on the screen. It wasn't funny. I know what funny is. Seeing a girl in junior high, who has never even kissed a boy, offer to sleep with an olderguy in order to be popular is sad. The main character is portrayed as utterly pathetic and miserable."
1,Not Great......,"This movie was depressing but i mean if you are emotionally hurt by this movie you probably have many problems of your own and shouldnt be leaving your house. But on the other side of the arguement that this movie is great.... It is a pointless stringing together of little problems teens have as they are growing up. We were all teens right? These are things we have all lived through. We dont need to see things that we ourselves lived through just to say ""hey my mom did that"" or ""hey i remember that when i did that"" This movie is just showing us things we have ourselves lived through."
1,"Terrible movie, really bad values","First, I want to say I do like Heather Matarazzo as an actor. She's brave and certainly you can see that by her choice of roles. However, this is a terrible movie and I was saddened that her parents or gaurdians allowed her to be in it. The song is catchy and no doubt the bad values displayed in this film are, too, for some people. The absence of goodness and caring in this film is just depressing. I'm sure some people's lives are like this, but it's not the commonplace experience of adolescence, even for 'outsiders' or 'geeky' kids. It's tragic and traumatic and frightening. Not comedy and definitely not cool. Furthermore, anyone misguided enough to think that the would-be rapist kid 'loves' Matarazzo's character is just sick in the head. Do yourself a favor. Avoid nihilism and other branches of art advocating bad values. Garbage in, garbage out."
2,Pretty Weak!,"I have bi-polar disorder, and I will say that this is only a fair history of manic depression. For that alone I give it two stars. The actors in this half hour documentary seem to overdo the disorder. It would be funny were it not so tragic."
2,Blah,"It is not surprising that Showtime cancelled this show after three seasons. Tara somehow lost her way in Season 3. The only highlight of this season was Eddie Izzard's guest appearance as Tara's professor/therapist. The rest of the series...well, it just felt like the show was trying too hard. There was too much drama, too much craziness, too many altars, etc. ""United States of Tara"" ultimately became too over the top, even for a show about multiple personality disorder. That's saying a lot. RIP, Tara. :("
3,United states of blah.,I feel like United states of Tara is the same old thing as every other season.. Very repetitive story line and is getting very tedious. But as always great acting!! Worth a watch if you like the two other seasons!
2,Interest level has waned on this season,"I loved this show, but seriously it became less interesting with every season. Season 1 was most definitely the best, Season 2 was pretty good, but Season 3 was a total Snore Fest! If you're a fan of this series and have not seen this season then I would recommend seeing this season at someone's place that already owns this season!"
3,"great story, but frustrating to read!","Overall, I loved this book. Good storyline, it definitely keeps you interested (especially after the first few chapters)..but I found the book to get quite frustrating after a while. Crystal and Spencer have everything fighting against them it seems like and you begin to wonder if they'll ever be together. I also didn't care for the way she ended the book. I like what happended, but I didn't like how it was rushed into the last 10 pages of the book. It's like you finally get what you want and then you don't ever get to know the details of what happens. Also, I know what people mean when they say Crystal isn't really likable, only because she makes some pretty stupid decisions and it's kinda stupid how she turns down Spencer when she can finally HAVE him! I would recommend this book though, just be prepared to get a little anxious!"
2,Poor Characterizations,"This is one of Steel's better books (although that's not saying much) but the characterizations leave something to be desired. Is anyone in this world as perfect (charming, beautiful, good) as Crystal? Spencer is a spineless wimp. And didn't anyone else besides me like Elizabeth better than Crystal?"
1,Garbage,"This is total crap. Imagine a world in which everybody has ONE flaw...except for the primary character of the novel who, the author assures us AD NAUSEUM, is absolutely perfect, without flaw, completely incorruptible, God's gift to this green Earth. Little snot-nosed brat if you ask me. I was forced to read this book for an ""Intro to Fiction"" class, and gave up after the first chapter, resolved to fail before committing such hara kiri upon myself...only to find out that the instructor for the course also gave up after the first chapter and scrapped the assignment. Oh well, you've been warned."
3,Star by Danielle Steel,"This book arrived quickly, no complaints re: the shipping. The condition was just okay. I had hoped that it would be in somewhat better shape. It looked like it had been squished and it's hard to hold on to it while reading. I was afraid that the pages were going to start falling out but they mananged to stay intact until I had finished reading it."
4,"Like most Danielle Steel books, highly entertaining","I was thoroughly engrossed in this tale of a starlet slash whore and the douchebag she loved.Spanning several years, Whore and Douche are very much in love but are both too driven by fame to be together, and both stuck inside relationships of convenience."
1,"Danielle Steel's "" Star""","I found this book to be very disappointing. I loved the movie better than the book. The romance was not very well developed and well told. I mean, what is this feeling that they have that keeps forcing them together all the time? It certainly didn't sound like love. You just don't look at a person and say that you love him or her, you have to build a solid friendship with them first and then a relationship. Marrying the villain was not what I had in mind for the hero and the ending was quite well written however disappointing the whole story was. I don't recommend that you read this unless you are really a Danielle Steel crazed fan."
4,Great Book!,I have read 6 Danielle Steel books andStar was my very first! I still can sayit was my favorite.
3,Star struck!!!!,"This was a great book, I couldn't put it down. I only wanted the best for the main character."
5,THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!,"This is the best book in the whole entire world! I finished it in 3 days, and I could never put it down. I stayed up until 3 or 4 o' clock in the morning reading it. It's a real tearjerker! I would recommend this book to anyone! Also if anyone knows where I can buy the movie could you please e-mail me!!"
2,"Basic Novel with Mention of ""Camelot Era""","7/11/02 Danielle Steel's (ISBN 0440500729) novel ""STAR""(44 chapters,447 pages main three characters ElizabethBarclay(whom SpencerHill marries mainly to stay in the correct social settings and circles),CrystalWyatt(whom he met when she was 14;and who becomes a ""star' in films and Spencer(who becomes a ""star""as a lawyer & travels due to his profession and is 'privy' to become part of the Kennedy force in Washington attempts to keep the novel 'true to time"" by mentioning current events via Crystals ""thoughts""(e.g. Ingrid Bergman ,the scandal surrounding her and Bergman's movie ""Anastasia"")"
2,Disappointed,"This was my first Danielle Steel novel, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed by it. The plot was interesting enough that I stuck with it to the end, but the book was in serious need of a good editor. The author repeated herself repeatedly. I felt as though I were reading a first draft instead of a finished product. If you enjoy reading for the character development and beauty of the language as much as the plot, I do not recommend this book."
1,"Redundant, Redundant, Redundant....","I think this book had a great plot. And that's about it as far as greatness goes. I don't prefer her writing style. While reading through, it's hard to tell what character's feelings are being conveyed as she changes character thought in mid paragraph. I would rather hear one chapter from one character's point of view. I think that she tries too hard to get her point across by saying the same thing but in different ways. You can see it page after page. Crystal needed to get out of town. Crystal needed money first. Crystal needed to graduate, but she needed to get out of town. You get the point just by having it written once! Is there a word quota she was trying to achieve, hence the same sentences being thrown around?I think it was just plain over written."
4,Exactly the same story,"This book is exactly the same story as American Star written by Jackie Collins, that doesn't mean that this book is better or vice versa, the only thing is that if you already read American Star, don't waste your time with this one.This book is the typical love story, at first Crystal and Spencer meet, then the problems begin and keep going on until God says: from now on everything will be fine, and everything is fine. Nevertheless, the book will keep you reading page after page and willing to know what will happen in the next page.The story of Crystal in Hollywood is the typical one, the problem is that many people like that kind of life, sincerely I don't like it and I think that is a pity that men deal with women like personal things."
2,A Waste Of Time,"Though Danielle Steel is not known for her great literature, but for her gripping storytelling, this book could undergo a few changes. I recomend it to people that enjoy a never-ending story, repeat after repeat of the same scenario, and a wimpy, unrealistic, bordering on sleazy main character to relate to. This book is exhausting. Time after time Crystal and Spencer meet again after being apart for a few years, and every time they make up some dumb excuse not to stay with each other. We all know that these books ALWAYS have happy, romantic endings, so why not just get to the point and be done with it? The ending of ""Star"" is one of those that makes you say ""Thats it? All this reading for THAT?"" Seriously, though, do yourself a favor and skip this book. I recomend ""Accident""."
1,this book........oh where do I start?,"This book spawns some of the most annoying characters ever made. Poor Crystal, she grows up unloved in the boonies of Colorado. Of course she is unloved because she is stunningly beautiful. How many times has this already been done before? At age 14, Crystal meets Spencer, and it is love at first sight. This book continues by revolving around all their chance encounters, followed by brief interludes where Spencer begs his wife for a divorce like a spoiled little girl, and Crystal gets beat up regularly. Both of them avoid getting together because they are thinking of each others happiness. The matyr thing gets old after about the 3rd page"
2,The Worst Shlock DS Has Ever Written,"This was without a doubt the dullest of Danielle Steel's novels, and I'm a huge fan of her books. I couldn't finish this one, it was so boring! I read about a fourth of the way through and then I just read the last chapter. I absolutely don't recommend this book to anyone."
3,Too boring....,"In my opinion i thought this book was a little boring. No excitement at all. For example,all i heard in this book was how attractive and beautiful Crystal was. I think that was mentioned in every chapter. It took me over a week to finish this book because i didnt feel like reading it no more. It was the same thing over and over again. I would not recommend this book. Also had a boring ending."
3,bruce lee documentary,"this is a short (about 45 min) documentary of on the films of bruce lee. the production value is low and the content is merely ok. it's valuable only to the fan of bruce lee (it does give a good list of all his movies, not as many as you think). i bought it in a two pack with another Lee documentary, The Intercepting Fist, a documentary on the style of martial arts he created, and is a truly good documentary. If you can find the 2-pack, go for it, otherwise, i'd probably pass on this one."
5,Path of the dragon,"Excellent footage of the master, Bruce Lee and some footage I never seen before. So, for the bruce lee fan a must have..."
5,A perfect match of talent and character,"This book is insanely fun -- the old, original Plastic Man series by Jack Cole had its ups and downs, but at its best, the wacky visual and creative genius was absolutely unique. Kyle Baker, whose own style tends towards the exaggerated and elastic to begin with, is a perfect artist to take this character on, and this first set of stories is a real doozy. Each panel bursts with kooky ideas and great visual gags; the book is filled with sly pop culture references, and hilarious inside jokes about the comic book subculture. It's a lot of fun. Plus, that new FBI agent is a total babe. (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain books reviews)"
3,Enhanced CD,The enhanced CD contains Sonic Foundry's ACID software which allows the listener to remix the Beat Dominator's bass style techno anthems. Great fun!
5,Just right,"These floor mats fit just right into my Hyundai Santa Fe (2007, Limited)! I haven't noticed any rubber odor, which a few other reviewers mentioned. They were a bit difficult to unpack because they were all stapled together with huge metal staples, so I had my dad use pliers to get the staples out. They are a nice color and the carpeting is fairly thick, which seems to hide the dirt from my shoes very well. Overall, I am very pleased with these mats!"
3,Momma's riding now!!,"Fit my Saturn Vue with no problems. Passenger rug was the perfect size, but the driver's ran a little small on the width. Other than that, no complaints."
3,smells,Seems to be a fairly well made mat. Bought them because my gold car has gold interior with gold mats. Wanted a change. Hate to say it but I must agree with the talk about the smell coming from the mats.
4,"Wow, I'm glad I bought these!!!","I can't say enough good things about these floor mats. They are better quality than I have found at my local discount stores. The mats are thicker, have better nubs on the bottom, better quality carpet, and they're larger and heavier. I drive a large sedan and these were also large enough to fit.I would go out of my way to buy these exact mats again, at least the front ones. The rear ones are just average. But, for twenty bucks, the front ones are worth it."
3,Not as plush as I'd hoped,These mats do the job but they are not as thick as I thought they would be.The back mats are very small and barely cover the floor. The front fit wellin my SRX cadillac.
1,It stinks!,Months of airing out can not take away the hideous stench coming out of these made-in-china mats.Avoid at all costs.
4,Good buy,"This is a good quality product. I have a honda cr-v and it fits good on it. It did not have any odorous smells when it arrived, just the new plastic smell. The pieces are of good quality compared to others I saw on walmart. I am very satisfied and would purchase again."
1,Rubber Queen Rubber Bordered Floor Mats,Ordered the floor mats for my car on February 2011. All the carpet has fallen off the rubber matt. Rubber Queen used to be a good product. I think there was a five year warranty on the product. Not happy with product at all.
4,Rubber Queen 70513,The floor mats arrived very quickly. The quality was great but the fit was not that good for the automobile that I had requested.I would purchase again.
1,Violin sound quality sucks,"Playing may be great but the sound quality such as imaging and transparency and hall reverb and acoustics are very lacking but what really is the deal breaker here is the sound of the violin...the recording does not extend in sweetness nor does it give any type of life to the violin. The violin really is that bad and sounding the way it does would make you start to think how a recording can get it so wrong. It sounds like a dub of a dub of a dub, I mean something is really wrong with the sound of this violin. Does anyone want to buy my copy? Tom Sakurai"
5,Exactly what I needed,"I live a third or more of my life in a cube-farm, so being able to look over your shoulder without turning around is a God-send. These little babies fit the bill."
4,Hotspots convex mirror.,"Love the mirrors, although they are being used for Fengshui purposes. They work just fine and are built very well. My only difficulty was getting them to stick on surfaces with just the provided sticky pads affixed to them. I had to apoxy bar-style picture hangers to the back so that I could hang them. Otherwise, a good product at a good value."
4,No problem w/ transaction or merchant! Y$4FAST(s+h)F=+CO2...FsloAOK?...ask Amazon!,"A great Shower shaving mirror if you purchase new sticky for the back. For some reason the replacement double stick foam seems to hold to tile better than the original double stick foam that came with the mirror. I cleaned the surface before I used the foam tape both times. I would purchase again when I move if I need to do so. Works great! My real regret is the mirror back is not aluminum instead of plastic, considering today's concern with autism linkage to processing chemicals. Plastics seem to be a real culprit. I can only hope future studies prove this to be incorrect.ChangeItOrDrownItB 36 Ears"
1,Don't waste your money!,The lowest rating allowed is one star; for this item it's really ZERO! Adhesive will not hold to your vehicle mirror. Both the ones I purchased kept falling off and I kept putting them back on. Finally one broke into pieces when it fell off in my garage. Amazon paid for return shipping and issued refund.
1,don't waste your money,On my first use of this product the draw string came loose rendering the shorts useless. What a waste.
1,Poorly designed or manufactured product,This product has a rough white elastic band that is very irrating to my skin. It is not wearable and was returned to Amazon. This could even be a manufacturing error because I bought a similar pair at a store and the elastic was encased in the cotton material of the shorts.
5,gasping,"This recording blew my mind. As a private teacher of flute and public school band director for thirty years (and an ardent admirer of the clarinet) I have not heard anything even close to this virtousity on any reed instrument. The clarinet professor at my alma mater used to say that the clarinet was ""an accoustical nightmare that should never have been allowed to survive""... Well, survive it has and Robert Spring smashes all the beliefs about what the clarinet can and cannot do. I can hardly wait to watch my student's eyes pop out of their heads when they listen to this!"
4,"The 6th Koko Book - Well-Plotted, But...","This is the 6th book in ""The Cat Who (TCW)..."" Series. The 5th ""TCW Played Brahms"" was the biggest turning point, and this book is the important sequel.I don't think the TCW Series is very good as a whodunit, but this book is relatively well-plotted. Maybe best-plotted in the six TCW books I have ever read. But I don't give this book five stars, because I still don't like Moose County and I feel the development is rather boring.And I feel Koko's sleuth ability is too much in this book, such as Koko gets cold to Qwill who barks up the wrong tree. Still tolerable this time, since it can be interpreted as Qwill's overestimation. I'm afraid it might go too far in later books."
4,Another good read by this author,"If you've liked the other The Cat Who books, then you'll like this one as well. There are some interesting twists and turns. The ending took me by surprise."
4,Fun Read,I enjoy this series of stories. Found this author while browsing the library. Not all the books were available so I started purchasing them on my Kindle.
3,"An interesting man, but is it an interesting tale?","A biography of a fascinating man, one of the most determined and unorthodox military leaders of WWII, who to this day can inspire extreme love or loathing. While intersitng to read about, he would have been very annoying to work with.This book covers both his upbringing and the miliary campaigns he was involved in. (I especially found the influence of religion interesting - he was instrumental in the early ideas on the founding of Israel) Fascinating topic, not so fascinatingly written - could have done with much tighter editing and explanation of many miliary terms and acronymns.Still, i am pleased i read it to learn more about Wingate, and the interesting story about his reputation, and like T E Lawrence, how it was shaped before and after his death"

4,Lovely watch,"My daughter in law selected this for Christmas and she loves the watch. It is fashionable and practical at the same time and a good looking watch. I wish the packaging had been more attractive and ""giftable"" but otherwise a lovely watch."
1,BIG Disappointment!,"Like many others, I went with this blender on the recommendation from Cook's Illustrated. I have had it less than 9 months and it is now in the trash/recycling bin. It was nothing but a major mess from day one but I thought I could live with some of the issues like:1. It never mixed anything all the way through without me having to ""hand mix"" to get it started.2. I could never pour anything out of the pitcher without it getting everywhere. It is too wide at the top.3. The lid seals so tight that when I would pop it off, food would often spray out on me.Things I couldn't live with:1. Shards of metal coming out of the bottom and also in my smoothie. Also found ball bearings loose in the base.2. Some kind of black liquid (probably food) leaking and spraying all over the place when I would blend3. Not being able to remove the blender from the base. It would get stuck after blending.I just went to Target and bought a $15 blender. It mixes 100% better than this Kalorik."
1,Burnt up dead,"I bought this blender because of the cooks illustrated recommendation too. After a few months of use, it just stopped working. Still under warrantee, I mailed it to Kaloric ($15 shipping). 2 months later they mailed me a new one. Two months after the warrantee expired it stopped working again. I am disappointed to say the least!"
1,Sprays smoothie all over the kitchen,"Loved the blender at first, but I'm junking it after about three months. Liquids are seeping through the blade assembly; it drips little puddles of juice and grease. The biggest problem is that the jar works itself loose every time, no matter how tightly I crank it down. I have cleaned smoothie off my walls for last time. Into the garbage it goes."
2,Lasted less than a year,"We use our blender to make smoothies around once a week. After about 10 months, the plastic socket that receives the drive shaft disintegrated. Since it's not repairable I had to throw the blender away. I'm still giving it 2 stars because it worked pretty well up to that point. On the plus side it was relatively quiet for a blender. Smoothie consistency was good except for the minor annoyance (also reported by Cooks Illustrated) that it left the occasional large chunk of un-pulverized fruit. Since it broke I've done the research again and may just buy another one. The issue is price: you can get one of these (or the equivalent under another brand) for about $30. The well-rated KitchenAid KSB560 was my other choice at about $100 but it has too many reports of leaking jars. I figure I can get by with one or two of these Kaloriks for a couple of years and hope that by then a new moderately priced blender will emerge as a clear choice in the ratings."
1,"Base Unit, Great. Blades & Company are Rubbish","Have had this for just under a year and am about to be on my third set of blades. The first ones came loose and got so loud I thought the blender was going to explode anytime I used it. The second ones have also become insanely loud, and have the added fun of emitting a pervasive burning plastic smell. Awesome. I can only imagine the toxic stuff it's injected into my ""healthy"" smoothies.Replacement blades are expensive and shipping prices are exorbitant. When contacting the company to ask for a (third) set of blades on the house since I'm still within the warranty period, I was told that blades aren't covered.Who cares that the base and motor are still functioning....I'm throwing this one out and looking elsewhere."
1,"Worked for a month, customer service AWOL","Had this blender and it worked great for a month. After a month, was making a smoothie and everything was ok, but then the next time I plugged it in, nothing. Jiggle the cord, nothing. Contacted their customer service department via email. No response. Provided my serial number and purchase date, resubmitted request to their customer service department and nothing. This is the last Kalorik product I buy."
3,Good blender but...,"I liked this blender and at its price point is hard to beat. Mine just died, three months to the day after I ordered it. I used it to make smoothies using frozen fruit and i used it four to five times a week for that task. The motor has been slowing and today it stopped and smoke was coming from the base.Having said that, I think it is a good blender for less strenuous tasks. I made a tomato soup in it and it worked wonderfully. Also handled milkshakes a few times with no complaints.At the price point (under $40), I could buy four every year for a while until it added up to some of the smoothie maker price tags."
2,"Here today, gone tomorrow","This blender got raves in Cook's Illustrated, which is why I bought it. At first it was great (we make a lot of smoothies from frozen fruit). After a couple of months, I thought it seemed louder than before, but shrugged it off thinking that it must have always been that loud, as it was still working fine. Well it turns out the noise was based on the fact that the blender basically vibrated itself apart! Didn't last more than four months."
1,Bullets over Blender,So we liked the blender but then the other day we found it spewing ball bearings (like little BBs at a high rate of spped) and rust dust. Bounced off our kitchen backsplash and just missed shooting my wife. if I wanted this kind of excitement in a household appliance I would have bought a chainsaw.
2,Good product-LOUSY company,"While the product is a strong performer the company is not. The blender is distributed in the US by ""Team Marketing"", a 6 person operation in Miami. They do not answer their phones, their employee directory is non-existant and their website is non functional for ordering parts. This is the context in which I experienced them: I broke the glass jar and could not find a replacement anywhere. As of 6/25/09 their website was unavailable to order. I paid $50.00 for the blender on Amazon in 1/09, a replacement glass jar costs $20 plus shipping. I would recommend you find a product where replacement parts are readily available or purchase a stainless jar. But when you need to replace the blades... you get the idea. Beware!"
3,Two speeds...fast and furious,"I bought this blender based on a positive review in Cooks Illustrated magazine. I mostly make smoothies using frozen berries and soy milk. It does blend everying well but it does not have a low setting and sends liquid all over the inside of the lid if I have it more than 1/2 full. If I stop the blender to stir the contents and then restart blending, smoothie will fly all over the place. Additionally, the lid is difficult to get tight."
1,"""What? Can't hear you!...""","Good price.Nice styling.Loud as heck.Doesn't quite chew up ice completely (or other stuff), no mater how long you can bear the noise.Blade base rusts @ about 3 months of moderate use."
1,Terrible,"I've been using this blender for about six weeks to make a daily breakfast smoothie that involves yogurt, frozen blueberries, and a banana. Nothing extreme. The plastic base cracked within two weeks. The blade assembly has rust sprouting everywhere. It is extremely LOUD (worse now that the base is cracked) and unpleasant. The glass carafe seems well made but the rest of it is just junk."
2,not what I had in mind,"I purchased this blender based on the Cook's Illustrated recommendation. While it does a good enough job at tasks requiring high speed and lots of power, I really wish I'd purchased a blender with a wide range of speeds, especially slower speeds. While it might do a good job with ice or a smoothie, both of the two speeds available on this blender are faster that what I typically like to use with my food. This blender tends to obliterate things like chutneys and pesto rather than make a nice, smooth blend. And I just don't like the idea of processing soups, etc. with such force. There is also a strong ozone odor in the air since the motor is so powerful. And it is so loud that I have to cover my ears when I use it in my ceramic tiled kitchen.My old blender could be set at very slow speeds, allowing you to turn up the speed just to the lowest level needed to get the job done. I think I'll sell this blender and purchase one with more speed options instead."
1,Broken after 14 months,Plastic support for the blades crumbled into our smoothie today after just 14 months with only a moderate level of use.
1,Worst Blender *ever*,I have owned this blender for a year. The top is cheap rigid plastic that is difficult to get on and off. Replacement gaskets are expensive and they wear out (so the blender leaks) regularly. The jar is not totally stable on the base. And the top reason I hate it is the blade continually loosens and as it does not only does performance suffer (it doesn't blend smoothly) it becomes louder and louder to the point that it is unusable. And rusting. Honestly I can't believe that Cook's Illustrated recommended this unless I just got a total and complete lemon.
2,Disappointed,I bought this because of the high rating it received. I am very disappointed. It is very loud and doesn't enen crush the ice for my protein drink
1,Not a blender for frozen fruit,Bought this blender a year ago to make smoothies using frozen fruit. I thought it worked great...for awhile. Now the blades won't turn and the bottom of the unit is rusting of all things.
2,"Simple, adequate, LOUD!","Bought this blender based on Cooks Illustrated review. If you're hoping for a quiet blender, this isn't it. Blade design looks meaningful, but our old Krups blender is plenty effective and much, much quieter. BTW, the two (count them, two) speeds are rather similar. There have got to be better choices in blenders than this."
1,wish i'd bought this on amazon,"I also bought this on recommendation by CI. I don't know how many blenders they used to test this, but if it was more than 1 or 2, I cannot believe they had no problems with this thing. The noise should have been a tip off right away, especially after CI described it as ""ultra-quiet."" It may be time to consider some type of class-action suit against Kalorik based on their homicidal product. I was also assaulted by mega-hot flying ball bearings after only a few uses, and actually have little dents in my stainless steel fridg Perhaps Amazon needs to start their own ""test kitchen."" I'd LOVE that job!"
4,As Expected,"This is the ""best buy"" blender recommended by Cook's Illustrated. They marked it down for not making perfectly smooth smoothies, and for taking a long-ish time to work. So far I have only used this blender to make smoothies, and there are often a few little chunks. Just something to be aware of if you're very particular about your smoothies.As other reviewers noted, the gasket for the blade is a clear/whitish color and could easily be lost.The edges on this blender are a little harsh: I cut my finger with the bottom of the base while getting it off a shelf, and the lid's plastic ridges are a bit sharp too. Just be careful.If these problems don't bother you, this is really a great deal for a blender. I expect to get many smoothies out of it, and am pleased overall with this product."
2,5 Month very noisey wonder,"Bought the blender because of Cooks Illustrated review, It works just as they said it would. However after 5 months the blender motor was so loud you almost needed ear plugs. Kolorik replaced the blender under warranty (I paid postage to get it to them in Florida, which was not cheap). But then again after 5 months the loud screaming motor noise returned. In to the trash the Kalorik Blender went. I purchased a dependable Oster Reversing Motor Blender, and have been very happy since. My last Oster is still going strong after 16 years."
2,Short lived love affair,"Worked well for a few months, then a ring around the blade assembly busted. Bought a new blade assembly from Kalorik (plus a high shipping fee) but now the motor is smoking and smells bad. I don't predict much time left. Can't find any decent blenders to handle a daily smoothie... might spring for Vitamix next."
5,Awesome. Just awesome.,"Love the product. Works well, easy to clean, easy to use. Simplicity and aesthetic beauty at a great price."
1,recommendation of Cooks Ilustrated??,"The manual recommends not having it on continuously for more than a minute. After a minute there are still lumps of banana in my smoothy but that is not my complaint. My complaint is that it gives off a high frequency, shrill sound. I have to both plug my ears and walk away from it to the other room. Who would have thought?? I always check hair dryers when I buy them (I had a boyfriend complain) but it didn't even occur to me to check the decibels on my blender. This is bad enough that I am one smoothy away from buying a new one."
1,Choose something else,"Like others, I bought this blender off of the Cooks review of it, thinking it would be better than my old Oster at doing smoothies. It was better at smoothies, but I used it about 20 times and the gasket failed on the blade assembly."
2,"Too loud, broke in less than 2 years","Like many others here I bought this blender based on the Cooks Illustrated review. The first problem I had was the deafening sound - my ears would actually ring after making a smoothie. I started using earplugs after the first two times, which helped.Otherwise the blender worked great for the first year and a half, then one day I lost the ""pulse"" option. The dial will rotate, but won't actually engage the motor except on the full-speed blend. I'm really disappointed in this blender and I'm tired of the low quality. I'm finally going to save up and get a vitamix, I think."
1,Get out your ear protection!,"My husband bought this for me based on rave reviews in Cooks Illustrated, etc.. It barely works. If you try to blend something that is frozen, you have to self-start it by stirring and there are still un-blended chunks. Almost right away it made such an incredibly loud noise that now our entire family keeps a set of ear protection muffs (the same worn when operating a chainsaw or loud equipment) IN our kitchen to put on when we run the blender. After reading all reviews, I think our suspicions are confirmed: the loud noise is most likely trashed bearings. Time to throw it out and go try the Oster that others recommend. Hope the product testers do a better job next time!"
1,need ear protection when using this blender,"I bought this blender several years ago (at Target) after reading the CI review. I have used it sporadically over the past year and a half. The blender blends OK, but it is so loud I feel like I am damaging my hearing every time I use it. Will not use it anymore, after reading other reports that the loud noise is caused by the machine shredding (and shedding) metal fragments."
2,Not very satisfied customer.,"Kalorik BL-16909 500-Watt 2-Speed Countertop Blender with 48-Ounce Glass Jar, Brushed Stainless Steel...I was satisfied with the blender - which I purchased in November 2010 - until it began to leak...it seems that the blade mechanism has become loose or possibly the sealer is worn out. I am seeking assistance from the seller."
3,Great at crushing ice; spatters everywhere,"What I like about it:-It is absolutely fantastic about crushing ice making it excellent for making margaritas, smoothies, etc.What I don't like about it:-It splashes everywhere. No matter how full/empty, no matter how thick/thin, you can't even open the little mini-lid while it's running without losing half of whatever is in there. NOT good when you're trying to make sauces that require slowly adding ingredients in stages.-It doesn't pour well. I've had this for a year and have tried about everything I can think of and have finally given up & just pour it over the sink. Plan on spilling a good percentage of those smoothly-blended margaritas!"
4,Dig into the past,This time the tables are turned - Chief Collig needs the Hardy boys to help him evade the law!! Frank & Joe face issues of Loyalty vs Law....and do a good job of it. Lots of plot twists.
4,Police chief Collig - on the run!,"This is another great Hardy Boys Casefiles book where you find out a regular character might be a bad guy. This book is good for kids, with plenty of fast-paced action."
5,Webster at his best.,"This album is comprised of select cuts from Webster's Jazzhus (Jazzhaus) Vol 1 & 2 CDs. Though this version is missing some of the songs of the Jazzhus CDs (most noteably ""Misty""), the mastering job a a tich better and the liner notes are more informative. So what to do? If you love Webster get all three discs. They are all (for now) available used.Tim ButlerChicago"
5,Fresh Air,"If all classical philologists would produce such erudite and yet elegant works as Mr. Nikitinski has done with his commentary on Persius the discipline would not have the reputation of being dry and nerdy. Latin does not appear as as the language of the badly dressed, spectacle wearing and grey faced schoolmasters we all have been tortured by but of wordly men with exquisite taste and sensitivity."
5,"0ur fears, our dreams. our lives . .","Why are we in such a hurry to do and be so much? Ruth Senter gives an eye-opening review of women's lives today. I read this book as I faced mid-life and found myself in the pages. Looking to do and be more than my neighbor, more than my friends, more than my mother and becoming less contented, less centered, less happy, less grounded in my faith. Who we are in Christ and who we are to the world are examined in this book. I found it encouraging and refreshing. The pages of my books are filled with underlined passages. I recommend this book to women at all stages of life."
4,Make Someone Happy,"I read some of the reviews. The one where it says that there all male charecters is not right. There is Mavis,Lady,Daisy, and Caroline and probally more on the way but it's the story that counts. Any way this video is really good. Of course it's not my favorite but good. If your going to buy this tape you'll be enjoyed as well as your child or children, and quite funny."
2,engines without women,"positive first: alec Baldwin speaks very good and understandable for my 3 year old.negative:the thomas the tank engine dvds are very simple made. Especially the people have only one or two expressions.negative: on the whole dvd is no acting female engine and one acting lady, Mrs. kimbal. She really is a helpless lady in distress, who needs the support of all the male engines and sir topham hatt.I hope, not even ladys 100 years ago where as the reverent pictures them."
5,Great News!,"Ladies and Gentlemen,if your kids are curious about this video then i've got news for them.According to bigstar.com,the names of the stories on this video are 'Make Someone Happy','A Big Surprise For Percy','Happy Ever After','Thomas And The Rumours','James And The Trouble With Trees','Baa!',and a Music Video called 'It's Great To Be An Engine.It also includes an engine to play with attached to the cover!"
3,Nice Focus,"This book states in plain, easy to understand language what we all already know but often forget - to focus on what his right in making our decisions. It's a nice kick in the behind for those who tend to make decisions based on our wants or desires at the time."
1,Um. No.,"Okay, can you say BAD BOOK?! Really. Half the time, I got the impression that he thought he was better than everyone else and he knew more than everyone else. While the question was a good question, how can you go on for an entire book?? No. It just doesn't work that way. Don't waste your money on this book, if you want to know the question then read through the first paragraph in your local bookstore and that's pretty much what the rest of the book will be like."
1,Don't waste your money,"I imagined a book thicker than 1/4"" and something with substance. If you're over 25......forget about it."
2,This book reminded me why Christian authors have a negative perception,"The author does seem to be too self-righteous. Major turn off. I was excited to read this book after it was recommended to me by a friend. There were moments where I was embarrassed to know he's a fellow Christian by some of his comments. Seemed non-accepting of people who sin - so unlike Jesus. The best question ever is a good question, but always sometimes hard to figure out in a rough life moment. I felt kind of bad about myself instead of feeling inspired and grateful for Jesus. Not worth a purchase."
5,Reality Check NOT a blank Check on LIfe,"Andy Stanley takes his time building up to the best question ever and it is worth waiting for. The book is very easy to read and makes allot of common sense as applied to everyday things like money, morality and relationships. Every one of the items, Stanley references with passages in the bible but doesn't over do it. The context of writing would be equally appealing to a believer and also a nonbeliever. Religon or belief is NOT overbearing in the book; Stanley uses everyday activities as a metaphore of life and suggests that mistakes we made unknowingly can be avoided by knowlingly asking, ""The Best Question Ever"" as a preface in our everyday application of living."
5,Modern-Day Proverbs,"This title is the second I have read by Andy Stanley. My appreciation for the author and his writing style is growing. He is entertaining, edifying and enlightening. In this volume, Stanley poses the best question ever. He first explains the question, and then applies it to time, money and morality. He closes with an emphasis on the importance of the best question ever.This book is a good, quick read that will benefit any Christian. I recommend it highly. After reading it, the chances are much better that the reader will ask himself the best question ever on a regular basis!"
3,"Good, but stops short.","I've read the book and recently led a small group through the DVD and study guide. Overall, it was good. I am a fan of Stanley and will continue to check out his resources. However this one fell short for me and for our group somewhat. The Best Question Ever is a great question, but to whom is the question asked? I think it's a question we need to bring before the Lord, seeking His answer. He lands on this point somewhat by the end, but it just doesn't come across strong enough for me. Also, He's very good at identifying an issue that surfaces when it comes to this question, ""What is the wise thing for me to do?"" Often, the problem is not that we don't know what the wise thing is. It's that our desires don't line up with what's wise. He's good at identifying it, but not as helpful in addressing it as I'd hoped. Still worth checking out."
5,A good companion for some of the hardest choices in life...,"For those who are wrestling with difficult choices regarding the end of life care of a loved one, this should be required reading. I suspect that no other book is given out or recommended by hospices more than this one is. It is short, gentle and compassionate, but honest and straightforward. ..."
1,LISTING IS INCORRECT,"What in the world? This is titled ""Copier toner"" but the photo and the description are about a case for notebook computers.........hopefully, someone who can fix the listing will see this note............."
4,An excellent accent piece!,We are expecting on March 29th and do not know the sex of our child. Goodnight bears was the perfect theme and the lamp truly helped in the final decision. The light in the baby's room is a little bright and this lamp is perfect for just a little light so as not to disturb the baby's eyes.
4,"Certainly cute and decorative, but not very bright!","This lamp is a perfect addition to the nursery, and its perfect as a very low-lighting lamp. The shade blocks a LOT of the light so it certainly cannot help brighten a room by any means. It would be a good lamp to put your baby to bed to, but thats about it. Its a very cute piece and well worth the buy if you are looking for something decorative. But if you need light in your baby's room, I'd recommend getting a regular lamp!"
1,Cute but...potentially Dangerous!,"OK, this Goodnight Bears theme is so cute, I have the whole set but was dissatisfied with the lamp. The base is plastic which could break plus the base doesn't have a slit for the cord to go through so if you sit it on a flat table it leans alittle crooked which makes it easier to knock over. It would work great if you have a table with a hole in it! Also the light bulb socket, the metal, gets extremely hot and It shouldn't be used in a child's room when they could get burned like that even if you put the lamp out of reach, children get curious and find ways of getting to things!"
1,Yawn city,Not a very objective document. More effective material is available on the web or on vendor whitepapers. Much of the material contained seemed out of date even relative to the publishing date. A very data vendor centric view on the topic.Weak. Don't read. Wait for the free download at some point.
2,Okay for classroom use,"World War I -The War to End All is a step up from this company's horrible Civil War documentary. The narrator is not the greatest, would benefit from talking head interviews. I purchased this DVD for classroom use and find that portions of this DVD are okay for classroom use. This DVD would be handy for educators that do not have access to VCRs and hence better documentaries."
2,Too American,"Interesting dvd. Especially where it is about the old film material. The voice over is dull, but ok. There is too much emphasis on the American involvement. I would have liked more info on the gas attacks, and the development of it. There is too little background. Its a good thing though that this information is put on a dvd for future generations."
5,SURPRISE!!,"I was very surprised when I received this watch (my wife bought this for me for my birthday)....I had never heard of Croton before ... The quality was as good or better as watches costing much much more!...The Band is nice & thick soft rubber (much nicer then the band on my Aqua-land or my Seiko dive watches) the band was worth the price I paid for the whole watch!$43 here on Amazon (retail price $200 plus) ... one directional bezel ..screw down crown, that you don't have to wrestle with..This watch is large 54 mm with crown & Thick...I'm very happy with it! Also bought the Stainless steel Blue & red bezel version! CC-ya -=CC=-"
5,Three Of His Best,"If you want to know where the modern realist tradition began, then look no further, it all began with Dickens. He was by far one of the most excellent observers of the life around him. He was of his time, and yet he transcended his times. These three books represent some of his finest creations. A must read for any reader who wants to call themselves well read."
5,Love it!,"My three year old loves dinosaurs I looked everywhere for different dinosaurs and found some pretty cheap tacky ones. The Scheich dinosaurs are durable, realistic looking and super fun! I would recommend highly to any dino lovers out there. He especially loves his raptooooooor!"
1,Don't Buy,I bought it last year and used it five times and now it just reads High and unable to get the actual temperature of the food.Waste of money.
1,Broke during the second use,This broke while I was using it the second time! It got stuck on high and the chicken was nowhere close to being done and now it doesn't work. Also the magnets on the back are no good for holding it on the refrigerator.
1,Don't get it.,"I just used it a few minutes ago for my roasted chicken. It started beeping and read HI (over 295 deg) within 15 minutes of roasting. The chicken is still raw!!This is one of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made. If you're motivated to get this thermometer due to the value, don't bother. It's not worth it."
1,dont buy it,"Like everyone else i loved this thing the first couple times. Mine only worked twice tho before becoming stuck on reading ""Hi Temp"". Save your money and look elsewhere unless you think paying $30 for reading the temp of two steaks is a good bargain."
2,Stuck on HI,"The other people posting the stuck-on-HI problem are not exaggerating. It works well for just a bit, then dies with the temp stuck on HI. The probe seems to be the culprit."
5,Finally able to keep temps correct,Cooked easter lamb to perfection. Also finally able to fry chicken on stove top and keep the temperature close to 350 degrees.
2,Tru Temp Meat thermometer,This is my second try with the Tru Temp device and my luck was no better than with the first. The product is short lived. The cable connection to the probe is a weak spot and fails quickly. The replacement cost (cable and sensor only) is relatively low at about $5 but the hassle is annoying.
1,Poor Quality - Poor Customer Service,This product and Taylor customer service rate no stars. It stopped working in less than 6 months of minimal use. Customer service was deplorable. They gave vague instructions to return the product for replacement and then claimed they never received it. Would not replace a defective $15 product. I will never buy another Taylor product.
1,Tru Turd,"Worked fine for the first handful of uses. Then one day turned it on and it was reading ~220F at room temperature. Tried new batteries same problem. I took it apart and tried shorting it so it would reset possibly. If I touched the probe to the negative terminal of the battery it seemed to possibly reset to 100C, so I thought if I got the probe up to the boiling temp of water and touched it to the negative battery terminal it would reset the temperature correctly. Well, in putting it back together one of the little wires came off and I didn't have a soldering iron, so now it's in the trash. Also the magnets wouldn't hold it up and then they fell off the back of the unit. Total waste of money."
1,Didn't work correctly out of the box,"I had the same problem as some others. The digital display kept turning off every few minutes, causing me to have to constantly push a button to turn it back on throughout the cooking time so the alarm would sound. Something was apparently loose inside because I could hear it rattling around in there when I shook it, but my husband said it wasn't repairable so into the rubbish can it went after the first use."
1,"Horrible, Peice of ...","I first bought this thermometer and thought it would be great. I used it once. Then it stopped working. It would turn off on its own, I changed the batteries several times and it still did the same thing. I discovered that if I held the battery cover on it would work. Then that stopped working. I had it about 1 week before it was completly useless.I then purchased another Tru temp meat thermometer (the stick one that has the temp on the head) I opened the package and it did not turn on. It came with a second battery so I tried to change it. I took off the cover to find the wires were not attached to the circuit board.Tru Temp makes cheap crap, DO NOT PURCHASE."
1,"Probe Breaks, obvious design defect","I have owned two of these. They work great for about a year and then the wire leading to the probe breaks, right near the end of the probe. Exact same failure happened to both probes. And they don't sell just the probe. So my advice is to avoid this product unless you want to buy one every year or so."
2,Worthless!,"The unit shuts itself off after a short while making it completely worthless for an alarm letting you know when you reach a certain temperature. So unless you plan on simply monitoring it constantly.Update: I have had varied success with it. It seems that it might stay on when it gets closer to the target temperature? Still, I'm looking for something that I can rely on."
1,Alarm does not work -- useless,"The alarm on this thing does not work, which makes the whole thing useless.A couple of times I have set the alarm to a certain temperature and relied on this thermometer to alert me when the target temperature is reached. Unfortunately, a couple of times it did not do that, it just turned itself off (batteries are fine) and my wort / milk got way too hot.This makes the whole thermometer useless. If I need to stand in front of the stove anyway I can just get a simple clip-on thermometer."
1,"Auto-off kicks in too quickly, probe connector is loose","I've been using this thermometer for yogurt making, and while it's convenient to have a probe on a long constantly in the pot it is frustrating that the thermometer shuts itself off every 10 minutes or so. (Hence the alarm is of little use.)The probe connector also seems pretty loose.And, as others have noted, the magnets on the back aren't strong enough to clamp to anything."
3,Same Problem as Others,"Excellent thermometer, but after about 6-months, got stuck registering HIGH as the temp."
1,Lasted a few minutes!,"I wanted to buy the Thermoworks (new and improved) thermometer, but amazon offered it through an outside vendor which charged a shipping fee... and this Tru Temp one seemed to have gotten okay reviews, so i went with the cheaper option.i received it this past week and used it last night on our steaks. it started off okay -- i took it out of the packaging, removed the tab that the factory put in to keep the battery from being used, and proceeded to use it. i was able to set the correct temperature on the display and saw that the temperature reading was going down once the probe went from the counter to the meat. i thought it was going to be ""set it and forget it"" but when i looked over about 5 minutes later, the display was blank. i tried the power button but to no avail. i then thought it may be the battery, but even with a fresh one, the power wouldn't turn back on!so unless you need a disposable thermometer that lasts only for a few minutes, move onto another brand!"
2,Low quality,"After searching and reading reviews, this product seemed to be the best of what's available. But, after using it twice I'm disappointed to say that the quality is low.The battery compartment door does not close. If you take the battery out, the door will close. If you put the battery in, the door does not stay closed. Obviously, there is a design defect. Yes, I'm sure it is the correct size battery. Finally, I taped the battery door closed in order to keep the product together.In addition, the device turns itself off when cooking and does not easily turn back on. This happened repeatedly when I tried to cook with it. I've reread the instructions to be sure I'm using it correctly, but something does not seem right.No, I would not buy this again. If the vendor were close, I'd return it and ask for refund."
2,Taylor TruTemp,It keeps turninig itself off. You have to go up to it while your food is cooking and turn it back on.
1,Horrible product,"I have now owned 2 of these thermometers and both were complete junk. I received my original TruTemp as a gift, and it quickly stopped working. While I was cooking it would shut completely off (not just the display), and it wasn't until I went to see why my chicken was taking longer than anticipated that I noticed this. At that point it was too late and when I turned it back on it informed me that the internal temperature was way overcooked. Taylor customer service was great and let me send the unit back for a replacement. Here I am less than a year later and now the new thermometer reads high ""HHH"" as soon as I plug it in. I will never purchase one of these again and will think twice before buying any Taylor product."
5,Really useful,I find myself reaching for this all the time. So much better than a normal analog and also does so much more.
1,Junk,TruTemp indeed. This thermometer consistently reads 12-15 oF too high. Perfect for that person who insists on coking everything well done... otherwise completely useless.
2,Don't buy if you need the magnet,"Unbelievably the 2 magnets won't even hold-up the display's own weight, without the probe connected!You'd think they would have actually tried it once after designing it.I did give it 2 stars because it works and I like the beeper's sound. I haven't had it long enough to see the probe start to read high as others have said, but reading high is definitely a bad way for it to fail since you'll get undercooked food."
1,Terrible and is going straight back,"This thermometer can't be used when the oven temperature exceeds 392 degrees, so if you're going to be roasting at 400 or higher, you can't use this in the oven. The magnets on the back are so weak that the thermometer just slides down the oven door and it keeps turning off every 10 minutes, so I end up having to check it anyway. I replaced the battery thinking that it was losing steam, but a brand new battery didn't solve the problem of it turning off all the time. I just checked it against another thermometer that I have calibrated properly, and there's a 20 degree difference between the two. I had really high hopes for this thing, but it's junk."
2,"Great, but NOT so great!","I used this thermometer for 3 weeks, and fell completely in LOVE with it! It worked great on Chicken, pork loin, steak, everything.... But, like many other users it eventually starting reading HIGH for the temperature and completely farted out on me! I'm reluctant to buy a new one, since I hear this is a common problem with users of the TruTemp product. What to do??"
1,Probe goes bad!!!!!,Owned this product for a couple months and the probe stopped working. Contacted customer service and was told I should BUY another probe. :( The probe to buy would be the SAME as the original probe so if it would be the same quality and dont trust it would last any longer then the first one. Their product was bad and they would not make it right. After doing research I see this is a common problem but they will not admit it.
3,Good product with an Achilles heel,"This product worked very well for several years, but finally the insulation broke away where the wire enters the probe, and now it's difficult to get accurate readings. A braided metal sheath to protect the wire and extend its life would bring this product up to five stars."
1,Junk,This thermometer is wildly inaccurate. Compared it with another thermometer I have and the this one consistently measures WAY too high. Dangerous if you're using it to test whether meat is done or not.
1,Worthless,"It continually turns itself off after only a few minutes & does not turn itself back on for the alarm to go off. Even when I continue to turn it back on manually and the alarm goes off at the ""proper"" temp the food is not done so I suspect the device is not accurate. It was like this right out of the packaging. I'm very disappointed!"
2,"Good thermometer, if you don't need precise measurements","I tested the probe on another digital cooking model, and found that in both models, its about 10 degrees off. I can only guess I was sent a faulty probe. For example, I tested my body temp, and it says it was 110 deg farenheit. The ambient room temperature said 85, when clearly it was 75 in the house. I bought this product for homebrewing because I need to keep my brew in a specific temperature range. So I guess I'll just have to accept that my beer is 10 deg cooler than what the monitor says."
1,Bad Crimp; wires pull out easy,"This product works fine until you put any tension on the wire connecting the probe to the thermometer. The wires disconnect easily and then all you get for a temp reading is HHH. I also have a ""stick"" type thermometer from TruTemp. It has also failed. I won't buy another of their products."
2,Why did I buy this?,"I loved the movie and for some reason was left with the impression that it was filled with wonderful music. So I bought the CD and was suprised to find almost nothing on it worth listening to. Almost the whole CD is ambient, drone type background noise that was probably very effective in the film but not something I would listen to seperately.It DOES feature the beautiful ""Me Voy a Morir de Tanto Amor"" which is probably why I bought the CD in the first place but don't get fooled. 95% of the music is not in that style."
3,Lucia,The music on the movie makes the soundtrack seem worth waiting. The songs are slow and hard to hear. They must have been replayed at certain segements over and over. They CD is not worth the wait. I w liked the version played on the movie than on the CD.
4,Watch it for the photography - not for the plot,"I am not going to comment on the gorgeous scenery and the steamy sex scenes. Other reviewers have said plenty on the subject. I will comment on the plot and the script. The plot must have been written by a 13-year old aspiring mystery writer. Too many coincidences piled up on top of each other. I know, the director was going for magical realism, but too many elements of the plot were contrived. All the loose ends end up tying in one big awkward knot. The writer took the characters by the scruffs of their necks and brought them into the same place, just so the movie would end on a happy note."
2,No Drama,"I hate to give this book such a low rating but it was incredibly dull. This is coming from a relative of the subject! The title might lead you to believe the author will paint a tale of two persons and compare the sides, but in fact she tells you in the first few pages that she sees him as a visionary. There is nothing in the book that would suggest the subject was a villain at all. I have a great interest in Mr. Maxwell and I could not bring myself to finish this book - and this was my second attempt."
1,Stay Away from This,"The most unreliable product I have ever purchased. Different from how they market the product, does not do the job."
3,in the editor's own words,"This is a learner's dictionary of Kyrgyz. It took exactly two years to complete. Two missing features seriously detract from this book's usefulness, however. First, the reference grammar that is mentioned in the acknowledgements was ""lost"", after I departed from the organization that funded the project. Second, two capital letters of the Cyrillic fonts mysteriously vanished en masse, before the manuscript went to press. The caps occur in some of the headlines of news articles quoted in the book. Sadly, these gaps will be a headache for learners. Although the errors were caused after my departure, I must bear some shame because my name appears on the cover."
4,Excellent,"The product was great. More importantly, amazon.com is easy to use and they ship so quickly. Love this site!!"
1,Lousy Transcription,"The transcription from the original text is among the worst that I have seen. No separation of poems, loss of key punctation, and insertion of special characters where the program got confused abound. DO NOT BUY THS VERSION!"
4,Human Factor Review,"As an individual struggling to choose a career between the nonprofit and for-profit world, Professor Senyo Adjibolosoo's book helps put in perspective that no matter the business setting, it is truly individuals with principles who make the difference. I would highly recommend his book to anyone interested in diving deeper and looking at ethical business in a new light."
5,A New Understanding,"Dr. Senyo Adjibolosoo pierces the heart of leadership in the human culture with a refreshing truth on the importance of character and moral integrity. This book not only reveals the missing elements that are so often overlooked in the corporate world, but also exposes the essential factors that our world inadvertently lacks. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who desires to be a part of this next generation's leadership."
2,Better Options Are Available,"The beat and rythym are constant, with no variety, changes or anything throughout every song. The vocals are subpar to say the least; growling, while carrying a distinctive sound... should also be able to have some pitch.To sum it up... if you want constant and repeating sounds across one cd... then this is the cd for you. However, if you want a bit of variety within the tracks of a cd, ""better options are available.""i.e.Soul EmbracedThe Devil Wears PradaVirgin BlackSuicide SilenceJob For A Cowboyetc."
2,Impending Boring,"I was in Best Buy today picking up the new Down, Black Dahlia Murder, Between the Buried and me...and looking for something different.Since Job for Cowboy is the hottest new band this summer, I got excited when I saw a sticker on the Impending Doom album saying: ""For fans of Red Chord, Job for a Cowboy, Arcadia Strain""I acutally popped this cd in first of all the ones I bought...by song 4, I was ready for the disc to be over.While the production quality is top notch, the guitars leave the listener wanting more. The vocals are uninspiring, low volume, repetitive tone.I think a listener can really enjoy this album if they are looking for hypnotizing death metal atmosphere. Also, a drummer can really appreciate the tightness of the rhythm section, and students of production would have a field day with some of the techniques...but as a guitarist, I was left unfazed, and wondering what else I could have spent $12 on."
1,"Death metal is not ""bad"". This CD is simply boring.","A picture of guys with death metal t-shirts on the back cover, and OOOOH, one guy is even trying to put on that evil SNEER! OOOOH, SCARY! So the metal fan buys it and then is pummelled with a ""new message"". But it's a boring message, and the music doesn't back it up.MUSICALLY, this band cops some of the chops others have invented in this style of music, but really isn't very creative. They don't bring anything new to the genre, except ""different"" lyrics. So it ends up sounding trite and repetitive. And gosh, the lyrics aren't even interesting, but more of the samey stuff that's been sold in churches for centuries. Really, if they were good, they would get a good review. They're just formulaic. I thought I wasted my money."
3,Too thin!,I was expecting a thicker plastic. It's kind of flimsy comparred to the other one I had. It's just OK.
5,Unbelievable footage of a concentration camp,This is one of the best videos concerning the Holocaust. Great teaching tool. Will give anyone that watches it an unbelievable look at what really took place during the Holocaust.
1,Le Dud,"It is no wonder this performance has sunk like a stone in the ocean. I am a big fan of Pinnock's later Sturm und Drang recordings, which balance warmth with clarity. This CD was recorded some three years earlier, and Trev was manifestly infected by Hogwood-itis during the sessions - hence the bulges in the melodic line, the squeezed phrasing and the overall anaemia. The ensemble - surely a 4-4-2-1-1 line up string-wise, is unable to bring any sort of palette to bear on this fabulous music. Compare it with the Dorati alternative (Haydn: Morning, Noon & Evening Symphonies 6 7 & 8): does it strip away the centuries of anachronism to bring us closer to the Master of Esterhaza? Not at all. It's fraudulent in a way.In short, this is 'Historically Informed Practice' at its most exercrable. Do not reach for your wallet, unless you want that saying about fools and their money to apply."
1,Not For The Beginner,"The instrument shop where I work selected this book for apprentice instrument techs. It is a disaster! None of the techs understand calculus or differential equations. Most of the theory and terminology are way over their heads. The book is long on verbage but short on real meat for the beginners. Quite honestly, I don't see any use in having this book on my shelf. I recommend the 4th edition of the Instrumentation book by Franklyn Kirk. It also comes with a very good workbook for a few bucks extra."
1,Only for Managers,"This book only provides a slight overview on system process control, if you want a detailed how to design a PID then look else where.Just my 2 cents."
2,Short Life Span,"While the thermometer seemed to give out accurate readings, it only lasted us a few months. I was always careful to only wash the probe and not get the screen area get wet and after drying, put it back in it's sleeve. So, I do not believe it was user error in this case but it could possibly have been defective. I'm not wasting my money to find out!"
2,Too bizarre for us,"This version of the Nutcracker drove us nuts for the first part of it (about 20 min) with old folks dressed in horrid costumes reminiscing about the days when one of them was a prima ballerina. Then traditionally dressed dancers started coming on the stage, but it was very distracting and muddled. We gave up, turned it off, and donated it to the local library."
1,very very disappointing,"The picture & audio quality is very poor worse than a video tape,maybe a bootleg copy."
4,Outstanding,"This dvd was obviously transferred from an aging videotape master, so while the quality isn't perfect, it is certainly very good.On to the contents: this dvd captures Tanya Tucker performing in Florida in 1983 while promoting her then-current album ""Changes"" (her only lp for Arista, still unavailable on cd). She's in top form here, especially 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down', which may be the greatest version of this classic ever. Other than the rare opportunity to see Tucker doing a ""Changes"" track ('Baby I'm Yours'), the set list is standard for the artist, and she never lets us down. There's also the almost-forgotten Terri Gibbs doing a few songs, if you're interested. All in all, a great dvd, especially for the price."
5,Cheap and does the job,"I read all the reviews and prepared for the worse. I expected to have a few scratches so when it arrived in a thin Amazon cardboard packaging (like a thick envelop but in cardboard) I was excited. The mirror is stuck to a thin piece of cardboard so you'll need to peel off the plastic bubble which covers it and attaches itself to the packaging. Upon opening it, my mirror had a few small blemishes, like small white sprinkles but that didn't bother me. For a couple bucks and free shipping Amazon prime, this served my purpose of using it for a rear view mirror for my desk in the office."
1,Not a good product,I purchased this for my computer monitor. I stuck it on the corner of a big CRT monitor. It worked awesome for a few days... Then I found it on the floor. The sticky part on the back of the mirror does not hold up. I put it back on and every couple days it is on the floor again. Would not purchase again.
2,sticky no sticky,you'll have to replace the sticky tape on these before they'll actually stick to your mirrors. I bought two and neither would come close to sticking to my clean mirrors. Dunno why. Had to replace the tape with 3M product and then they stuck fine.
3,"well, it works","it's a mirror, you know? I put it up in my cubicle because I was tired of people walking past and scaring me, so now I got a bit of a visual clue before they are all up in my business. It adheres to the carpeted cubicle wall pretty good."
2,Not what I wanted,This is more less a big blind spot mirror and not what I wanted. I wanted a regular mirror for my desk at work. This is not it.
3,"Scratched, and cheaper elsewhere","As warned by several reviewers, mine is slightly scratched in the center. I don't particularly care, but it is lame after this many complaints. More annoying is that I saw the same basic product for half the price at a local rx."
2,OK mirror,"Mirror was just little scratchy. was not really new. felt like used mirror has be re-packed and shipped.ok mirror,"
2,Too small!,Was looking to put these on my Ford F150...and they are just too small. I should have read the size closer before ordering.
2,Came Scratched,"Just got home and opened the package. As others have written, the package it comes in sucks. It came scratched/scuffed up in the middle. I'm not too happy about it. It defeats the whole purpose of having a mirror. The item is not worth enough to go through the trouble of returning."
5,This is perfect!,"This mirror is perfect for what I wanted. People are always sneaking up behind me at work, and I don't see them. If I have my headphones on I can't hear them either. When they finally touch my shoulder to get my attention, they scare me to death. I have used the smaller round stick on mirrors you could get in the car section of the local big box store, but they don't even compare. I had to stick this one on the shelf instead of my computer terminal - it is much bigger, but SO WORTH IT!"
4,does it's job,"Bought it to see over my shoulder in my cubicle and works great for that.Surface is a little scuffed and has a small flaw close to the center, but I only use half of the mirror (which is clear), so not bothersome for me."
3,Arrived a little scuffed,"Almost nothing to it, mass wise, has an adhesive disc on the back approximately 1.5"" across, slightly off-center. The actual mirror part thought seems to be silvered plastic (no surprise), but arrived with what appears to be scuffing directly from the packaging itself. As long as there isn't a light source in the reflection, it's barely noticeable, but it's there."
2,Not worth for money,"Even though it's a packed one, seems to be old. It's more like a plastic toy. Better go for high quality products."
4,Works as advertised but could be cheaper,"I am using this at work for my computer since I sit with my back to the corridor. It works well but I feel like for a plastic mirror it could be cheaper than $5. Overall though if you are looking for a mirror to stick on something, this works as advertised."
1,"defects, pay a dollar or two more to get a better quality mirror","bought 2 of these for my car, i noticed small scratches on them, but probably wouldn't bother me looking at them from my driver's seat. When i put them on,i noticed a dent in the mirrors, i felt it, and it was round, so it was probably on the inside. i ripped them both off immediately and tossed them out. I get what i paid for.The time it will take for me to ship them back out for a refund isn't worth 4 dollars. Writing this review took me a minute, so hopefully it'll give you an idea not to take the chance on this product. I hope it helps someone."
5,Great,These bags work great. I use them to package cookies that I make and sell at a local restaurant. Easy to full up and seal.
3,Get what you pay for,"These are pretty cheap, but you can't expect much for the price. The buttons, including the D-Pad stick pretty bad. As NES turbo controllers, though, these aren't a bad deal. I would consider buying them again."
1,Not AT All What You'll Expect!,"One of the controlers didn't work. But, I waited too long to send it back. I didn't notice any ""Turbo"" enhancements at all when I played. If you're use to the original controllers, the control coordination will seem awkard on these. Overall, not satisfied."
5,"""Killer Dance Remix""","I love the club remix of the hit song ""Kiss me"" lots of energy, I'm a dj and this mix packs my floor everynight.Check out the dubs if you like house. The ""Take me there"" Dub is very Phat with a razor & guido feel."
4,A good pump at a great price,"I feel that this pump is as good as a new one, for a fraction of the price. The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that it was not an EXACT fit. The electrical connector was different, requiring slicing in the supplied replacement connector. The inlet filter was larger and had to be stuffed into the housing. An alternative would be to use the original. The back end of the pump was shaped differently, and the original rubber mount had to be stretched to fit. It seems OK, but I'm not completely happy about that. But I am very happy about saving over $200."
2,Poorly Engineered,"I purchased my SC-E120D16:9 electric drop-down screen 12/06, and after two years, the center has started to bow causing ripples in the screen. These really need to be supplied with a center support bracket."
4,Great Screen,"This is a very good screen. Only downside is the way the plug had the control box in the middle; making it hard to hide the cord in the wall. It also is slow to go up or down, but the motor works great. It came with a remote, even though I don't think it was advertised, which is a very nice touch."
4,well worth the price,"The screen moves up and down pretty smoothly, it can go all the way up and down automatically or you can stop it at any point. The screen surface is smooth when down. My only complaint is that the wiring for the control from the screen could be longer, it's only about 6' of cable from the screen housing to the control and about 10' from the control to the end of the power cord that plugs into a standard electrical receptacle. It dose come with a wireless remote as well that works from anywhere in the room about 35'x25', but it would be nice to have more flexibility in the mounting location of the hard wired control."
3,"good features, poor audio quality","This is a very good, full featured phone. However, ifyou haven't used a digital recorder before, you shouldlisten to one before buying. There's a lot of static and thesound sometimes breaks up if the caller isn't speakingvery loudly. This can make it hard to understandmessages."
1,Very poor phone,Made a mistake sticking with the usually reliable Panasonic brand.1) Handset broke within 1 year2) Dropped signal walking to the next room3) Awkward controls for answering machine
3,Suspect Battery Problems,"I bought this phone for use in another part of the house. I have two other 2 line Panasonic phones ( older versions of this one) and have never had a problem with them. This phone worked fine for one day. The handset died an I assume the battery may have been the problem. I exchanged it for another one.I don't use the answering machine portion of this phone, but I wanted the dual Caller ID screens, so I bought this one.I will let you know how this replacement phone works in a few weeks.Overall I have had good luck with Panasonic unitl now."
1,If you like being frustrated - this phone is for you!,"If you like to HAVE TO answer your phone using the speakerphone - this is your phone!If you like to CONSTANTLY UNPLUG your phone to try to get the handset to work with the base - this is your phone!If you like buttons that stick and double-punch - this phone is for you!If you like calling Panasonic to complain, only to be told that there is nothing they can do while they admit that they have troubles with their phones in general - place your order today!If you like pouring your money down the drain - now's your chance!If you have any sense at all - run away as fast as you can!"
4,Lots of features,"We bought one of these in December 2002, and it hasworked perfectly for us. It was a little cumbersome toset up (some settings are easier or only availableif you use the handset menu), but once we learned itsquirks, we have had no troubles. Just bought a secondone for vacation house."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"This movie first attracted me because it has two of my favorite actresses, Bridgett Fonda and Penelope Ann Miller, and one of my favorite actors, Keifer Sutherland.It's an intersting story with a lots of drama, plot twists and surprises.They are all faithful to the story.I caught just a part of it on cable once, accidentally. That was what made me want to buy the DVD.Finding out that Penelope Ann Miller had a sexy role in the movie was the clincher.Glad I bought it.I think that Miller and Fonda are two of the most attractive and underrated actresses of recent times."
3,This is great until lesson 9,"and then the bottom falls out. This book is fantastic as far as a beginner or review course for html and basic CSS. However . . . the chapter on CSS layouts and positioning (lesson 9) leaves ALOT to be desired. I became completely lost when I reached this chapter. I don't know which one of the authors handled this lesson but I'm hoping they'll fix it for future editions. They assume that the audience knows more than they should about class and IDs without ever providing adequate examples. The examples that are provided seem to skip steps. Still a good book but if you're new to CSS layouts and positioning like me, you're better off googling a CSS tutorial for beginners."
2,Very Explanatory - a bit too much,"If you want to spend hours reading about html, this is the book for you. To be fair, I used a free online tutorial ([...]) to teach myself html and CSS and it worked well for me because it teaches you everything you need to know and takes you through the lessons quickly with no extra fluff. I definitely won't say that this book isn't useful, but it isn't easy to read and it takes much longer to understand the concepts than it should. Plus it mixes in CSS near the beginning without explaining it.It does split everything into lessons, which makes for a more orderly learning experience. Overall, only buy this book if you need it for a class."
2,Very Big Pills,"I like the combination and amount of minerals in this. However, I choke on these HUGE pills. This is not a matter of a person having difficulty swallowing pills. I take what most consider to be large pills without a problem. But these are the largest and thickest pills I've ever taken. I don't plan on re-ordering this product."
4,Hitachi Ni Cad,So far the battery has performed as expected. I generally prefer a Lithium over Ni Cad when I have a choice. You don't have a recharge memory from not discharging it completely prior to charging. That in itself can shorten the battery life.
5,Brilliant and Original,"Michael Feinstein has produced a unique concert as a tribute to Sinatra and his contemporaries. He has selected an eclectic mixture of songs which he delivers with his customary verve and charm. Backed by a terrific orchestra Michael Feinstein is on top form; highly enjoyable and highly recommend, not just to fans of Mr Feinstein but anyone who loves good music."
2,Short concert but that's a good thing.,"This a short concert, maybe 60 minutes. It's supposed to be a tribute to Old blue eyes but most of the music is not Sinatra's legendary work. Just as the concert is picking up momentum with New York New York, that's the final song. The sound is fair. The good thing was because this concert was short I had enough time left in the evening to watch the Jackie Evancho blu ray concert ""Dream with Me"". Absolutely spectacular. I'll have to add my review to the other 5 stars for Evancho."
1,Greenfielf Tap,I ordered A Greenfield Tap but got some other mfg that was made maybe in China. I would not recomend using this site for anything since they show one mfg and ship a different mfg.
1,Incompetent,This DVD is so bad that when they talk about General Winfield Scott they have a picture of General Winfield Scott Hancock. It is so poor I dumped it in a recycle bin. Whoever did this DVD has little knowledge about the American Civil War. One star is more then it deserves.
2,Oh my...,"I can't believe I bought this game. It was cheap and I wanted to try some Xbox games online. Sorry to say that this one dissapointed me. Horrible graphics (for Xbox? c'mon!), it was just a port from the PC version. I could be wrong a bit because I don't know the differences between the two, other(obviously) than the menus and controls. If you're looking for a good military game, buy Socom 2 (or Socom 3 if it's out at the time of reading, Oct. 2005) for the Playstation 2, much better."
3,Fun.. Only On Xbox Live,"If you dont have Xbox Live, dont buy this game. You will be really dissappointed by the single player, its a waste of time. Just computer bots that you kill. Kinda wack. The xbox live is fun though."
3,Nice game for playing on line,"If you don't like to play on line, don't buy it. It is kind of boared playing it by your self"
4,Is Counter-Strike for real? You better Believe it!!!,"When I first rented the game, I had only heard about it. About it's years of success on the PC... being a major XBox fan, I had to rent it for XBox. When I slipped it into the disk drive, and selected a mode of play, (hostage rescue), I Immediatly fell in love with it!!! The game is SUPER addictive, (Therefore I was up all night playing.) Then I started playing xbox live... IT WAS SUH-WEET!!!For people who want a challenge (and hopefully have an xbox live connection, for it is only single-player without), this is THE game to get!!!"
2,very dissapointing,"this game is not much different than thecomputer version, it wasa verylarge dissapointment"
4,waste of money!!!!!!!,"I just bought this game about 20 minutes ago. I played it for 5 minutes and wanted to throw it away. The graphics are weak, game play is choppy and it is an all around boring game. I really wished I rented it first. I am going to trade this one away a.s.a.p."
2,A classic,This stuff is great and the most fun I had!!!I don't own it but a friend let me use it for some weeks and this is just plain fun.Yes the graphics aren't the good but if you are complaining about that I have a huge list that also could have better graphics starting with the game Quake 4.This may actually be a import from the PC to the Xbox but never played it on PC so can't say but for those that have an Xbox BUY THIS N0W! Probably take some days to get use to for those noob with FPS.This game might not appeal to you the first 2 weeks you got this game but this game is those rare games that you play when you are bored and even with games like Halo and Unreal this one is picked up.Verdict: 2.8 out of 5.0 This game might not be played much but still you will need it for those times that you are bored and need some gaming this one will entertain you for hours.
2,this title needs to be realy thought of,"Counter strike, very bad, game the single player missions suck, you can't move on unless you change maps yur self. The box is very unclear on its discription, the box says one thing but once you play the game its not the same. great for muilti player not for the those who get mad easy, there are no respawns when you die, you have to wait until the game is over, this game is not worth the 49.99 they ask for it"
2,not intertaining,This was given to my 12 & 13 year old grandchildren. They played for about 3-4 mins. They said it was boring!
1,A Review of the Single-Player Missions,"I don't doubt that playing Counter Strike online with several other people is fun, but the single-player missions are a complete waste of time. They're not really missions at all--they're ""scenarios"", no plot, no direction, just lots of mindless running and shooting. I was expecting CS to be like SOCOM, an online-enabled game that also happened to have a truly stunning single-player experience. But this ain't SOCOM. The graphics are horrible (even worse than Ghost Recon), the sounds are muffled and the voices are often unintelligible. The reviewers at IGN.com got it right: If you don't have Xbox-Live, then don't play Counter Strike.I rented it for five days, but I took it back after one night."
2,PC VS XBOX on couter-strike,"Ok, so heres the deal. If you own a pc, have a fast internet connection, and have a mouse, not a touchpad for your PC, go and buy counter-strike for PC, belive me it is way better. If you don't have a PC and still want to buy counter-stike, go and buy Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3, it is way better than counter-stike for Xbox. If your still not satisfied go get cstrike for Xbox. THIS GAME IS A DIFFERENT AND WORSE GAME ON XBOX. i love it on PC, hate it on Xbox. I bought it all happy that I had bought cstike on Xbox but then played it for 10 minutes, turned off my xbox, took out the game and I haven't played cstrike on Xbox for 3 months now, not a good game at all."
3,it's okay...,"i'll agree with the little to no lag, but that's b/c the environments are so bland (and the graphics look like they've been bleached).the whole part about CS being updated for the Xbox is a load. maybe a few little tweaks were added, but nothing impressive. the indoor environments look better than the outdoor scenes and the character models are sweet, but this is an ugly Xbox game otherwise. i'll take gameplay over looks, but when you can't see if someone at a distance is a friend or foe b/c the graphics are so muddy = the game is not so much fun.it's okay, but Rainbow Six 3 kicks CS's behind on the Xbox. sorry. only buy this game if you're a huge FPS fan and you absolutely must have every XBL game. rent it if you just want to take a look. i wish i had.(and i guarantee that the guy who gave the graphics a 9/10 never played this game.)"
2,CounterSUCK,"I think I waited too long to buy this game. A non-Halo playing fan of CounterStrike said I should play it. Man.....it ain't Halo. It was a lame time killer. I guess once you have played such as Halo 2 and 3, Gods of War, Crackdown you really can't expect to a game made that long ago to compare. Dissappointed but, at the time maybe this game was cutting edge."
2,Good if u have XBOX LIVE....probably,"I bought this game the after thanksgiving, getting it on sale. i am extremely disappointed. I have a few things: 1. I don't have XBOX live, which would probably make this a better game. 2. The graphics are like N64 or PS (NOTHIN LIKE HALO'S GRAPHICS) 3. The aiming recticle is like a dot, and i like it to be a little bigger. 4. To easy 2 die, terrorist shot one shot, and your dead, and you have to watch your teamates finish the game. 5. To hard to aim 6. You can't pick up dead players ammo, guns etc. 7. Don't buy this game when its still $50, wait for it to go down, or rent it, or get it used. Its not worth your money at $50, unless u have friends with it and XBOX live. 8. If your lookin for a game like this, try Rainbow Six 3, or if your new...Get HALO, every loves that game."
2,Are you serious?,"How dose this game have the good reviews? The games Singleplayer sucks, but thats because its meant to be a mulitplayer game. Well multiplayer sucks also. I play alot of Xbox live games and if your thinking about buything this game, don't. Get Rainbow Six instead or something. Because the gameplay makes this not fun. Also the graphics are very medicore. Don't waste your money on this game."
1,poor quality better on the pc,"this version the controls are akward and hard too use. worst graphics ever seen on xbox, they should have left this alone and on the pc only, nice attempt but falls short of the original."
2,Uh...kinda boring not as fun as Halo or Unreal,Hey if you don't have xbox live don't bother getting this game. The AI is just plain stupid and the controls kinda suck i mean the highest look sensitivity is about equal to 4 on halo c'mon thats some slow crap. The only good thing about this game is its different than the usual halo or unreal online. But other than that...yeah if it comes down to $10 buy it i guess cause that's probably how much its worth.
2,What was I thinking?,"I came home so excited that bought Counter Strike for Xbox but like other gammers said on previous reviews...after 10-15mins I was so dissapointed because of the difficulty of aiming at enemys with the little joystick stick and the stupid joystick control configuration, plus you can barely see the enemy from a distance, you need to be infront of them to shoot accurately, plus not fun unless you're a LAN party or Xbox live which it sux without the live kit which allows you to talk to other players, cause it is no fun being the mute player that everybody dislike. plus the cost of a membership just to play onlikne after you paid decent money to own an Xbox? in my opinion: it is a bigtime rip off from Microsoft"
1,PC is much better,"Ive been playin cs for the pc since the beta versions and i must say that the Xbox version is total crap. I would have given it a zero if i could. And btw for the guy that said this is on the half-life 2 engine, well, thats totally wrong."
1,It could have been nice...,"It could have been a great game, maybe it is. But I never received it therefore I have not played it."
5,Another great Ateco set,"Like I always say, I was always a Wilton gal until I tried an Ateco set. This is a great set of different tips that make cool designs. Highly recommended."
4,GOOD QUALITY,I received these tubes in good condition. They are fairly large and would be perfect for piping cupcakes. They are good quality and will not dent easily.
5,LOVE THESE PASTRY TIPS!,"GREAT SET OF TIPS FOR ICING CUPCAKES AND CAKES! OR FILLING PASTRY DESSERTS! LOVE THEM! GREAT QUALITY! FOR THE PRICE, YOU CANT GO WRONG!"
2,Poor indication,"I had no idea these were ""large"" pastry tips so I went ahead and ordered the standard sized couplers to use with them. I wish they would rename this product to ""Large Pastry Tips."" Tsk tsk."
3,3 Large and 3 Extra Large,"This set contains mostly large tips that will not fit on standard couplers. I thought this set would be like half of the extra large tip set that contains 12, however only 3 tips are extra large - basketweave, round, and star. The basketweave may be useful for crumb coating but a little on the small side. The round tip is really big, perfect for cupcakes. The french star tip is also good for cupcakes. The three smaller tips are okay for cupcakes but I'd say they're more for cake borders/decor - closed star, french star, and round."
3,"Nice metal car, but...",Good quality car with nice shiny paint job. Unfortunately it looks more like a collectors item than a childs toy. The paint can scratch easily and it's about twice the size of a normal matchbox/hotwheels car. This car can not be used with hotwheels/matchbox playsets due to it's larger size from what I've seen so far.
4,Rhyming has never been more fun,I heard this CD yesterday and I loved it. I work in a school with preschool age children and we listened to this cd. Totally adorable and everyone including me was dancing!
5,Three words: fabulous fabulous fabulous,"If you enjoy any of:- windham hill type music- piano of any kind- just seeing someone at excel at their craftBuy this DVD. Not only is it very good quality - video and sound, it is an excellent production. We get to see and hear George play, but also learn something about him and his music. Not to mention several other great artists.Truly wonderful."
3,"Great music, bad editing","I love Winston's music. Every song on here is great, and the performances are fantastic. So if those are your only criteria, stop reading and place your order.However, I wish the team that produced this video had done a better job editing it. Placing George's comments DURING the songs was a horrible idea, and I can see how the nature images (which I personally love) can interrupt one's enjoyment of the performance. The makers of the DVD should have give the viewer three choices: straight concert footage, concert footage with Winston's commentary, and concert audio with nature footage. That way, no matter what experience you wanted, you could get it."
5,Silver Hoop Earrings,"Good quality, good size earrings. Have worn them alot since receiving them and the price was fair."
4,the Faceless Man -,"The Faceless Man, also known as Anome or Durdane, is like a typical Vance novel in that it features a strapping young adventurer pitting wit and candor against opposing forces in exotic and debaucherous locales.Vance revels in describing the cultural customs and mores of the characters that people his work. The Faceless Man, the first in the Durdane trilogy, is no exception. While the central chacter Etzwane does not stick out among the protagonists of Vance's many novels, music is a central theme of the book and Vance, a musician, excels in his descriptions of alien musical interludes and compositions.I work in a library in Florida, and this book was very hard to find. We had to request it from a Library in Omaha Nebraska. Vance's work is elusive and unknown but highly suggested for those that enjoy Science Fiction with a more fantastic element."
1,Good Luck,"Good luck getting these out of the package. The educational value of this toy is in wire removal. The majority of the weight of the package is in the wire used to hold the animals on display in the package, the wire weighs more than the toy. Plan to spend a few days getting these critters out of the box, assuming you want the legs intact."
2,The Shoemaker's Daughter,When I read the review of this book it showed promise - but in fact it was extremely predictable and boring
1,Dissappointed!,My mother bought this for our seven month old daughter and when we used it Piglet would not float. Don't they test these things before they sell them. What a dissappointment to have a tub toy that can't be used in the tub. Pooh is cute and does not seem to have any problems.
3,"cute bath toy, BUT...","These bath buddies are so cute. I was a little conserned that pooh's shorts might be cloth and that they could be taken off (I have a 20 month old and I would get to put them on a hundred times), but they are part of pooh. Piglet is also cute and is floating in a tube that is also a water sqwirter; which my kids love, BUT piglet will NOT stay upright, he floats on his side. I am very disappointed in this. If I would have known that he wouldn't float correctly I would not have bought this toy because it makes my son very angery that piglet will not float upright."
2,not that amusing,"My daughter received this toy for her 1st birthday. She is now 14 months and she has yet to pay any attention to it in the tub. She doesn't even notice that it's there. It's cute, but just not that amusing for young ones. Plus, piglet does not float upright so that is a bummer also."
2,Cute but USELESS,"These toys are cute..BUT...THEY DO NOT float, except in the drowning poistion, Pooh FACE DOWN and piglet on his side.....If the would stay in the upright position, would be cute. My son does LOVE them, but definatly NOT worth what they are asking for them....More like $5-$6 range. Also, Pooh is VERY HARD, not advisible for throwers or those with smaller babies."
1,Not sure why this book was recommended.,"I was so excited when ordering books to help decorate my new home in the French Country style, but I was extremely disappointed when the book arrived. They should re-title this book REALLY DEPRESSING. Only recommend this book if you are interested in the depressing and dirty side of rural poverty."
4,A really good book,"This book is about a girl named Maxine and her brother Derrick who is missing. One morning her brother and mom were fighting on the way to school, and though he was supposed to go into school, he never showed up. They have cops looking for him, family, and friends, but they can't find him. So Maxine goes through his computer and room and tries to find clues about where he is or why he left? But does Maxine or her family ever find Derrick? And if they do, is he dead or alive?This book was really good. It kept me reading and I couldn't put it down because as I read on and on I kept finding clues. But I'm not telling where or if they found him. I think the things that happened in this book could really happen in life. And if some people could relate to the book or no people that can or were in that same situation they would want to read it. I think teens would really like this book because it will keep them hooked and make them want to read more."
4,"Raw emotion, anger and passion.","The pain and emotion that went into this album is incredible. Max is trully inspirational and emotional vocalist. The pain Max puts into writing his songs sets the standard for any angry poltical band. The guitaring and bass I find to be rather repetative and similar from song to song, but the vocals, lyrics and tribal percussion more than makes up for it. The greatness of Sepultura rubbed off onto this album, but is almost gone on Soulfly's latest album, ""Primitive"". If you like Sepultura then you will like tracks: 1,2,3,4,6,9 and 13,14."
3,not what I thought it would be,"This is a nice collection of Maya Angelou's works, however, it is far too cumbersome to read in bed. Very very thick."
5,Only half the story,This is an excellent book for improvising with little resources. It is tried and tested by the gov' so it is reliable. But you must have volume 1 to make it complete.
3,OK,If you don't mind the smell similar to baby formula this will be OK for you but that smell turns my stomach so was unable to use although my daughter didn't seem to mind the taste in her cereal. Gave to a friend and she had no problems with it and her son took it well in his cereal.
5,Will buy another one,"I love this Racket. It is light weight, powerful when I put the strings on the highest.I will buy another one."
2,SOMETHING IS WRONG,"DEVON GRAVES was once affiliated to one of the greatest prog metal bands of all time - that being PSYCHOTIC WALTZ. Dead Soul Tribe for some damn reason is just so lacking and very pale in comparison to his former band, it just doesn't even come that close.Why would someone call this a work of art and a strong dose of prog metal? This tells me that they are not very experienced or diverse in their music experience. This album, even his first two DST albums are just very bland and so uninteresting and does not really offer anything new or outstanding. DST is just very forgetable material and it just doesn't go anywhere.Why does DST exist? Beats the living F*** out of me."
4,"For Fun, not Collections","My kids like it. It's got excellent layout, clear crisp pics, but isn't comprehensive. Great to look through, and point to - look, I had that one when I was a kid..... (YOU were a KID?) I don't use it with my collection, but I am glad I bought it - it makes a pleasent just for fun."
4,Barbie Sticker Book,"When I ordered this I thought I was ordering the actual book, I had simply switched from hardcover to paperback, and I didn't realize that it was actually a completely different book until later when I read the word sticker. The book itself is great, it arrived in good condition and very quickly, and my girls love it. I'm not sure how well the stickers are going to be shared with four of them, but I guess we'll work it out. I did go back online later and order the book I had originally intended to get, and my grand total was still low enough that I am pleased.So, for the true review, I was thrilled with the quality of the product and the speed of delivery. I was not thrilled that when I clicked the paperback tab before ordering I ended up with a completely different book instead of a paperback version of the book I was looking at, but I don't think that's the fault of the seller, I think that is an Amazon.com glitch."
5,On our 3rd copy!,"My daughter loves this book, and we are on our 3rd copy because she has worn it out taking it on trips, in the car, etc. Her favorite part is the international dolls section, where she enjoys looking at national costumes from around the world. The layout and photos are very well-done, and it brings me back to my childhood as well!"
3,Proadnivity galore,"Teresa Nielsen Hayden (she wrote Making Book, which is very good and I have read it many times) is narcoleptic. I had not realized people who slept so much wrote so well. Of course I still think Teresa Nielsen Hayden may be the only one. This book displays so much proadnivity that I had to give it 3 stars. 2 were for that, the other one was for ridiculopathy. I'm fond of made up words."
4,B zone a novel of the gun,"Overall a fun read, good to read a story where the main actors are gun enthusiasts and not crazy. Imagine that! quick read, kind of light story line but then again I was not expecting a deep novel either. Just a good read that was accurate in nature and reflected a positive light on gun owners/users. recommended if not for anything else a good book to read on your day off or on a rainy day."
5,Love Netgear,Plugged it right in and no issues. I have never had issues with Netgear that why I keep coming back.
5,Great product,Bought to run additional computer off of incoming ethernet line. No loss of speed through Netgear 605. Great product in my opinion.
3,There's cheaper AND better,"I have owned three Netgear GS605NA's at home (two for audio setups and one for the home office) since January 2007, and I've found strange auto-negotiation problems (of which other users report here) and so all three have occassionally needed to be power cycled. While the Netgear GS1-5 is supposedly better, it's well documented serious heat problem worried me as heat is the primary reason for premature failures. So, I went with the newer and cheaperD-Link DGS-1005G 5-Port Gigabit Desktop Switchfor replacements. Then again, your Internet connection is likely the bottle neck at no more than 10-25Mb (for cable) or 7-15Mb (for DSL). So, why does anyone need more than 100Mb from their switch? You only need 3-4Mb for streaming video (1.5Mb with Silverlight). Perhaps, the newD-Link DES-1005E 5-Port 10/100 Desktop Switchfor just $15 is really the 5-star best buy."
2,Worked fine for a while then dropped to sub 10mb speeds,"This unit always ran hot, but performance seemed unaffected for 8-10 months or so. When my wireless transfer speeds took a nosedive, I initially assumed it was another neighbor stepping on my signal (happens every 6 months or so), but then I realized that everything running through the netgear switch was just as abysmally slow. I eventually power cycled everything on the network to no avail. Swapped out the netgear with aTP-Link TL-SG1008D 8-Port Unmanaged Gigabit Desktop Switch(which is older and has always been cool to the touch) that I had on a different subnet of my network and all speed issues vanished. Needless to say, I will not be replacing with another netgear."
5,NETGEAR GS605 5-port Gigabit Desktop Switch,"No set up, no drivers, just plug and play. It plays well with my LaCie network attached storage drive and my Airport extreme base station connecting wirelessly to my Laptop. I am having some connectivity problems but I think I have ruled out the switch."
2,Tends to overheat regularly,I bought this late last year before other reviews indicated the overheating problem. The unit works great but frequently runs hot and shuts down... often at the most inconvenient times. There are too many other options than to choose one that apparently has an inherent reliability issue.
2,Failed after 3 years,"I bought a pair of these three years ago and they both worked flawlessly until about three days ago. Once it was clear that one of the units was dying, I touched base with Netgear to see about a replacement.And they essentially told me to piss off since it's out of warranty.So now I have to spend at least $40 for a new unit to get my network back up and running. Obviously, I'll be spending the extra $10 and doing what I should have done in the first place - BUYING THE LINKSYS VERSION.Only buy this product if you don't mind your purchase having a built-in expiration date."
5,It works as described!,"I don't know exactly how switches work internally, but it ""IS"" a Gigabit switch I paid for. Unbelievable Value."
2,"Inexpensive, but not built to last / high failure rate","A few years ago I upgraded my extensive home network to gigabit ethernet. During that upgrade I purchased two of these 5 port switches and also a matching 8 port switch (Netgear GS608). The switches worked great until fairly recently, so I'm giving these a couple of stars. However, last year the two year old 8 port switch failed, and a week ago one of the 5 port switches failed too. That's a 67% failure rate within 3 years. It's probably a matter of time before the last one fails too.I've learned my lesson...AVOID Netgear's consumer-oriented switches. I've been replacing these junky Netgear switches with genuine Cisco brand switches (not the rebadged Cisco-Linksys stuff). Sure it's more expensive, but long term it's cheaper and less hassle than throwing out several switches and buying new ones."
1,worked for a while but no longer does 1Gb only 10/100,"worked for a while but no longer does 1Gb only 10/100. Seems to be a comon issue with this switch.A google search ""Netgear GS605 v2 fix"" yielded the answer. I am posting the link here to see if someone from Amazon will remove it.[...]I actually did not realize the issue till I tried to get 1Gb to work with it and found ""speedtest.net"" was choking.I'll need a new switch after less than a year."
1,5 dead switches in less than 2 years,My coworkers and I own 6 of those switches with the same model number but with different Rev numbers. They all completely died within 2 years. Before that they kept loosing Ethernet link.The Gigabit link always falls back to 100 Mbps even when connecting 2 of those switches together. They continuously lost links on all the ports or sometimes on just some. I tried about a dozen of new Cat6 cables still no improvement. They were running hot all the time. Real piece of junk. Netgear Customer support is also as bad as their switches. I went with 2 other brands ( Trendnet and DLink) and bought 5 of them. Trendnet switches are at least half the size of Netgear switches and they are running cold. Dlink are bigger than Netgear. After one month still not a single problem with any of them.
1,Less than pleased...,"My Netgear GS608/GS605 experience has been far less than stellar. Their support was low-quality at best, the hold time was nothing to brag about, though I have held for longer, and their ability to find the information requested (Wether this switch supports Jumbo Packets for gigabit) was limited at best. The answer was finally obtained (No, not supported by anything but their higher-end managed switches) after several hangups and false starts. I will be returning mine in favor of something else from another manufacturer."
2,Needs to be unplugged from time to time,"I found that this switch gets pretty hot, and turns it self off every couple days, after working fine for a couple months. If I unplug it, let it cool, and then plug it back in, it works for a couple more days. I have not tried netgear support yet to return it, or otherwise troubleshoot."
1,Good - when it works,"This switch worked perfectly for several months. Now it periodically stops recognizing one or all of the network drives it switches. (Cables have been checked, power quality is good.) When it works, speed is good. I will replace it with a reliable D-Link switch."
3,"Works well, but very hot","I expected better than this from Netgear.The switch runs at 1GB and speed switches from 100/1GB just fine, but it does run very hot and tends to shut itself down. That being said, it does not appear to be disruptive on the network. I've had my pc complain of a disconnected cable (which was really the switch shutting off) and a data transfer to the server never stopped. A power cycle fixed it, but I may return it still. It would probably be well suited to a network where it's not on all of the time. Don't expect to add it to the switch stack or bury it in the wiring closet unless you have a cooling fan on it."
5,I love this series.,"If you ever get the opportunity to watch Kimagure Orange Road, don't hesitate. Orange Road is about a boy, Kyosuke, who settles into a new town and eventually builds strong relationships with his classmate, Madoka, and a younger girl, Hikaru. The series is full of humor and suspense, and at times very emotional. Although, KOR seems a little cute at first, the strong development in characters and plot make this a story that everyone can relate to.KOR has many good qualities as an anime, including a great plot, engaging characters, excellent subtitling, and wonderful music. I highly recommend this video to anyone interested in anime, as you'll learn to love the blunders of Kyosuke, the antics of Hikaru, and the charm of Madoka. I hope this review has been helpful."
2,Holmes filter by Buyitnowamazon,"Please be advised that these are not genuine Holmes filters, and can tell by the manufactuing materials. This is not saying that they will not perform as well. However on the same note, if you think you are getting a genuine Holmes one, you are not, so is the price really a bargain?? Then the S&H is another fact. Each product cost $5.00 to send, and no discounts available for multiple ones in a shipment. The Shipping cost are tooo high, which increases the ""good"" price. If they came directly from Amazon, the S&H would be free for orders over $25."
4,Trigger Finger alowa you total control of your drums,"Unlike the first reviewer my experience with Trigger Finer has been a good one. At first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in Impulse (Ableton Live) once I realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze. I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless. The htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers."
1,Streamline Audio Trigger Finger,"If this is being sold by Streamline Audio, be aware that this in not the Trigger Finger at all! It is just the metal mounting bracket!!!"
2,Not worth the trouble,"I've had the trigger finger for about three weeks now. The first problem that I had was mapping controls. Even though the Trigger Finger comes with M-Audio's Enigma, the program sometimes works. For what ever reason Enigma will recognize Trigger Finger intermitly. I still have trouble using it in Reason and Fl Studio 8. The Trigger Finger has more of a headache than its worth. Unless you plan on using it with ableton or protools don't buy this."
2,Michigan Consumer,"Cool product! Very hard to figure out. Should have come with easier software. Should have pre-programmed beats and stuff. Overall, I like it but I am still not comfortable using it."
2,Workbook,"The actual The New Strong-Willed Child book is excellent and of great help in walking the razor-edge life of parenthood. The workbook is really too extensive and too time consuming. I got this book to help me be a better parent, not to ""show my teacher"" that I applied the principals. The book is absolutely great but this workbook is an unnecessary money-maker for the author."
4,"Not just scuba, also apnea diving is wonderful","When scuba diving is becoming just a modern trend all over the world, the apnea world is still more all less a virgin. There is not a lot of literature available about this theme, Freedive! is a good start from all aspects. You get a good overview of freedive world - history, techniques, equipment and some of the area where apnea diving is used. Maybe I missed a litle a background of apnea, but you can read that also in some other literature...A good source of information with nice photos."
2,Murder of a Mafia Daughter: Life and Tragic Death of Susan Berman,"I really was excited to get this book and begin to read. That was where my excitement ended. The author is all over the place in each paragraph, chapter, thought, etc. I have read some sentences many times and others that I thought would have more depth fell short. I would like to know about this woman's life and the case being built around her murder. However, I feel there are a lot of words in this book just to get it long enough to be a book. It probably could have been an article.I started to scan the pages for important facts and haven't been able to actually read full pages/chapters. I still want to get to the end, but the middle is painful."
4,Great Cookbook,"Really like this cookbook, I own a copy and purchased this as a gift for a friend who was much appreciative."
3,Just too big a sound,"The big orchestra sound is too big and muddled. For instance, in the finale of the Variations on a Theme by Joseph Hayden the Bach-like pasacaglia and the plucking of the strings get blended in with everything else. A much better set of the Symphonies and the Variations is the Sir Charles Mackerras conducted version (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000003D2C/). In the Mackerras version every instrument can be heard for itself; it is far more light, concise and beautiful. Buy the Mackerras version instead."
1,Poor chooce for Racing Game,"My kids absolutely loved the Hot Wheels World Race DVD. They also love racing games. So, we thought this would be the perfect gift. NOT. The graphics are horrible and it was an all around disappointment for the 6 year old, 10 year old and Daddy."
5,Very Interesting !!!,I picked this up because I was interested in calligraphy and was hooked on the story. I would really recommended it.
5,No problems,"These spark plug connectors fit perfectly and are a plug-in replacement for the old ones. They appear very well made and durable. In case you are wondering why there are only 2 in a set, the other 2 plugs are connected directly to, and are a part of, the ignition coils. Lancer is running fine, maybe even a little smoother with these wires."
4,A great primer on japanese baseball and its superstars,"Baseball fans with an interest in the new breed of Japanese baseball player making an impact in the U.S. Major Leagues will find Robert Whiting's book a welcome and timely introduction to the likes of Ichiro, the Matsuis, Nomo, etc. While the title may be somewhat misleading, as one would think the bulk of the book would be a biography of sorts on Ichiro, what readers are given instead is a highly readable, in-depth look at the origins of baseball in Japan and comparisons of the major differences between the US and Japanese game (practice, coaching, tactics, game philosophy, business models) that would ultimately lead to the production of players able to thrive under the brighter lights of the MLB. Ultimately though the most entertaining portions of the book are the beginning and ending chapters that serve as mini biographies and a study of remarkable contrasts on the Mariner's Ichiro Suzuki and the Yankee's Hideki Matsui."
1,Would not recommend buying,"I bought these speakers to be used in the landscaping around my pool. It worked well first time I installed them. These are outdoor speakers that are supposed to be water resistant. After a couple of months through a few rainy days, the speakers started to have a discoloring all around the grill. It looked like rust and really looked terrible. What was supposed to blend in with the landscape now became an eye sore. Then they stopped working. Apparently, they are not as water resistant as they claim and when I called the company to deal with they warranty, they were very uncooperative and said I should not leave them outside. This doesn't make sense as they are advertised as outdoor speakers. DO NOT BUY THEM!!"
5,A Nice Short Inspirational Mystery,"I was looking for a good mystery read, and found this book in my daughter's Heartsong collection. Once I opened the pages I couldn't put it down until I had finished reading it.The story is centered on volunteer firefighter, Buck Connelly who happens to be the fireman on the scene of a tragic automobile fatality. The victim just happens to be the husband of Buck's ex-flame, Alicia. Later in the story Buck is arrested and charged with causing the wreck, and deliberately letting the victim die so he and Alicia could resume their old relationship. Buck goes to trial and the mystery unfolds when the real culprit is revealed. Buck also has to face one of his greatest fears.A nice little short inspirational mystery."
2,Denon is not what it used to be,"If I could ""easily"" return this unit, I would - unfortunately I bought it via the web. The bottom line is that the unit just sounds OK, that's it. Yes it has lots of features, but the sound is just slightly better than a boom box. I hooked the same speakers, CD player, and monster cable interconnects up to another amp and it was much, much better - night and day. If you're OK with something that looks decent and has plenty of features, then maybe you'll like this unit. If you care about the quality of the sound and want ""high fidelity"", look else where. Denon has become a provider of mass market, made in China stuff these days - no where near the quality they delivered 10+ years ago."
1,Avoid,"Sound is only ok. FM tuning is not fantastic.But the big problem is that if there's a problem, a fuse (hidden inside the case, that the manual doesn't mention), blows. If you open the case and find it, you discover it's a 125V 6.3A mini fuse, which Radio Shack does not stock. (I can't tell if it's a slow blow or fast fuse, either. The manual should specify that; did I mention the manual does not mention the fuse exists at all?)This is just ridiculously poor design. Fuses should be in externally accessible holders, they should be mentioned in the manual, there should be a spare in the shipping box, and in home use products, a shorted speaker lead shouldn't blow a fuse in the first place - the receiver should display a message and turn off the audio.I don't know what they were thinking, but I'm thinking I'm sorry I bought this."
4,Solid unit for sure,"I picked this unit up from Fast Freddy's Pawn one year ago (July 2010) for $100.00. Freddy said ""It's a Denon, so it must be okay?!"" I agreed, but who cares? I was only dropping $100! He had the remote, the manual and now an extra $100 in his pocket.Over the past 12 months I've listened to my Dual CS515 turntable, Tascam MD350 minidisc player, Optimus CD-100 CD changer, Technics SL-PD807 5 disc CD changer, Sony TC-K615S 3 head tape deck and of course the built in receiver through this unit into my B&W; 201's. I have other amps (carver and an akai am2800) and gear in other parts of the house, but this is the main unit to be played when guests gather, or when I want sound throughout the whole house (i just CRANK it up and i can hear everywhere).The Denon is clean, sounds smooth, gets terrific compliments (even from my wacky audiophile friends) and hasn't let me down yet. If presented the opportunity, would I buy this unit again? YES!"
2,Caution bying Denon because of parts situation,"Let us say you go after a Denon. It may last forever,but what if any accessories, such as a lost remote had to be obtained from a contracted supplier in Florida with no close personal relationship to DNN Holdings, the Denon-Marantz outfit,from what I garner. My efforts to get a remote for a Denon deck,I bought just two years ago,ended in a one hour phone merry go round. Fortunately, there are third party learning remotes. Me, for a receiver, I would go with the big names, like Sony, Pioneer and JVC. They hold parts for many years. Regret a somewhat negative review for this essential aspect."
2,Read closely,"Be sure to read closely if you want this item. It is JUST a holder, basically. It does NOT come with an actual charger. You will still need a home charger to plug into this unit. Plus, if you have any sort of case or cover on your Razor phone, it will not fit into the docking station! I have a very thin, tight fitting cover on my Razor- which I feel I need because the phone is pretty delicate, compared to many other models- but if I want to use this docking station, I have to remove my phones ""protection."" I'm not sure it's worth it, frankly."
5,Beautiful Angelique,"I have been reading the Angelique series since I am 17, I am now 69 and am reading the series for the fifth time. I just cannot get enough of Angelique and am one of her millions of fans. I want you to hurry and translate the last three books I believe they are books 11, 12 and 13 into English. As soon as you do this pleae inform me so that I can purchase and continue with Angelique on her saga. The authors of this book Serge and Anne Golon are amazing."
5,"IF YOU PLAY BASKETBALL, THIS DEFINITLY HELPS","lets start off by saying a little about me...i am not the smallest guy out there, so i sweat a lot. since i play ball a lot, this was really useful and matched with my new tmacs. the sweat no longer went to my eyes and i didnt have to wipe my face every second with a towel. the wristband probably even greater. since i have a one handed shot, just like shaq, i need something to help keep it straight and protect it. not only do i also stand out on the court, in increases my preformances. big or small, this product is one of the most helpful out there."
4,Ranma 1/2 Rules!,"This is the video of the anime only ""Egg catcher man"" I like this episode because it focuses alot on Kasumi/Dr. Tofu relationship. THe second episode os like the manga, where Kuno wins the Wishbringer. The magical sword will grant its owner three wishes, so Ranma*Pigtailed Girl*goes on a date with THe ""Blue Thunder"" to get him to wish away a ""feminine problem"" TEE HEE! Both episodes are great! A great buy for any anime otaku or Ranma fan!"
2,Disappointed,"Very small wipes canister, not very wet, small wipes, hard to pull out of container. With that said, I like the ingredients and the idea, but keep working on the formulation and engineering of packaging."
5,REAL SOLUTIONS TO REAL PROBLEMS FACING SUPERVISORS OF PEOPLE,"Supervisors of one or more employees in the public or private sectors will welcome this practical tool for dealing effectively with discipline issues. The book offers useful checklists and numerous examples of written memoranda for each step of the disciplinary process. Authors write from successful experience with employee matters. Highly recommend!!! Douglas A. Brown, Ph.D., Executive Director, School Employers Association of California"
1,Save Your Money,"In the opinion of this writer, this book is merely an attempt to teach school districts, and other agencies, how to harass outstanding employees who stand up to their dishonest employers. The author is part of a law firm that recently represented a school district that retaliated against an exemplary employee who stood up for the civil rights of his/her students. The district was found to be in VIOLATION of federal law by a Federal Law Enforcement Agency and the employee prevailed."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY!!!,"I purchased this product and went directly to installing it. The product did not work and when I tried to contact the seller (aka John Murray [...] he not only was not helpfull, but he has not aided me in the return of the product. This is a perfect example of a poorly run company and my advice to any future buyers is to look somewhere else!! They are selling low quality parts and their customer service is inexistant. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING FROM THEM!!"
4,Suse Linux 9 versus Red Hat LInux 8,"New to Linux and running Red Hat 8, I found the Red Hat 8 Bible was the best of all the books I had on running Linux, particularly for getting direction on a specific problem. When I moved to Suse 9, I hoped that the Suse 9 Bible would be as good. Disappointment.The Suse 9 has less pages, though some of the difference may be that the fonts are somewhat smaller. It also seems to have more ""screen shot pages""--pages mostly filled with a screen shot with some text below that gives the obvious, e.g. ""To create a user, click...,"" when the book is being consulted because filling the screen with the obvious did not do what was desired.For a problem with Suse 9, I find I often end up sorting it out, by consulting the Red Hat 8 book. If you already have the Red Hat 8 Bible, getting the Suse 9 version is probably not going to add much. If you don't have either, then, for someone relatively new to Linux, I certainly recommend getting one of them."
3,Lacks Depth,"Initially, I was pleased with this book--it is helpful in getting started. But, now the issue for me is that it lacks some key topics, like how to kill a process. Searching the index turns up nothing for the following terms: kill, restart, named. There is nothing about day-to-day admin types of functions needed for process managment."
2,Some good Bond themes,"This is not a good CD for those of you who want the James Bond theme music incorporated a lot. There are some songs which it appears in, like Bond 77, but otherwise, it's just a lot of other 70s music. Too bad, John Barry incorporates good Bond music, but this is not one of the Best Bond soundtracks."
3,"Favorite Soundtrack, Disappointing ""Remaster""","After checking out the new editions of other James Bond soundtracks, I was anxiously awaiting the full ""Remastered Version"" of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.And found myself disappointed.Where the other soundtracks were not only remastered but filled out to include most of the music (doubling the tracks), SPY's new edition is simply the same exact tracks from the original 1977 album.I'm giving it three stars because it's one of my favorite 007 soundtracks...but I felt like giving it one since I'd wanted the full treatment similar to what ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE or FOR YOUR EYES ONLY got."
3,It's OK,"I paid $2.99 for this book. I will not read it again, but I am not disappoint that I read it. I enjoyed the family dynamics, three different family groups reacting in different ways, quite interesting. Great time filler."
5,perfect in every way!,"This book was very cute! I didn't find this book to be in moral, at all. Yes he thinks about women from the past at the beginning of the book, but realistically that was the way it was back then. There are not any nude seens or bad language! I love the heroine and her funny clumsy ways and I love that Miles is a great father!I think you'll miss a cute clean book if you don't read this."
4,Delightful Intentions,"This was a lovely little read. Not a lot of fiery passion, but the heroine (Harriet) is absolutely delightful and the trajectory of the romance makes sense. The hero (Miles) is, at first, portrayed as proper and somewhat fussy and it makes sense that he - as well as everyone else - would assume he would prefer the older, ladylike sister Charlotte. The younger sister, Harriet, is her complete opposite. She loves architecture, is prone to clumsiness and often speaks before she thinks. That the most proper Earl would come to love the younger sister, despite the chaos that surrounds her, comes to make sense as the story unfolds. I also liked that the hero had been very much in love with his first wife and is such a loving father. I thought that his ambivalence about loving again was very well-handled. Add to all this some interesting information on architecture and a secondary romance and this makes for a very pleasant and delightful love story."
4,Tender and Sweet Love Story,"Lady Winifred Tyndall sends a letter to her brother the Earl of Strickland inofrming him of her plans to visit with him with her children and her husband's two cousins. Miles Prescott's, Earl of Strickland, is in his early 30's widowed with two daughters and imediately senses his sisters plans to wed him off to one of them.The very proper Lady Charlotte Abingodon is a widow and is accompanied by her nineteen year old sister Miss Hannah Fairbanks. Miss Fairbanks is fun, bookish and interested in architecture and is very different from her stuffy and ladylike sister. The Earl must choose which of the sisters would be the best mother for his daughters and then realizes his own heart in the process.Came across her books as it was a recommendation on my kindle. Its a good regency story with clean romance(only passionate kisses)"
4,"Delightful read, classic story!","I just want to say what a delightful read this was! I have been on the hunt for new authors or better yet authors I was not familiar with but I enjoyed and have a nice back list, Ms Hern fit that criteria.You don't have to have read the other book in this series to thoroughly enjoy these characters. There are lovely twists of the unexpected here, the characters are well developed and fun to be with. Enjoy a romp with a lovely Regency writer. I won't even address the 1 star review, Ms Hern's writing does remind me of a modern Georgette Heyer. If I have one complaint it would be that the story ended too soon. I can't wait to read the larger stand alone book from Ms Hern.At this price point it is well worth the money to find a new author or better yet revisit an author you enjoyed. Happy reading now."
5,Well Worth It,"I couldn't wait to start reading this book. The Earl of Strickland made his first appearance in The Garden Foley and I was disappointed that he didn't get his women. Half-way through it, I wanted to choke him. I knew which sister he needed and he wasn't co-operating with my wishes at all.Lesson for you - a book is good, when you want to choke someone that is non-existent, even though you like him.Dont miss this one."
4,A Informative Descriptive Account of the Blitzkrieg,"Once again TimeLife gives an excellent account of a particular period of the Second World War. The detail is all there. The escalation with Norway, the conquest of the Netherlands, and of course, the brilliant Fallschirmjagers exploits againt Belgian positions.This book presents a closer picture of the Desert Fox, Rommel and his 'Ghost Division' , the 7th Panzer.The occupation of France is presented with good clarity , and lastly the Luftwaffe's efforts against Britain. Overall, an excellent source for the condensed study of Blitzkreig."
2,Ummm,I did not like this book. The characters and the story just made little sense. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more seeing it on stage than in book form.
5,Enthralling,"A must read!God Head takes you INSIDE the mind of a mentally ill person, ie: the narrator of the story. This is the first book I have read to do this, and it makes for one crazy thrill ride. As you read from first person perspective you get to jump around with the craziness of the main character's head. Every loop and twist he takes you take, and every time he rambles insanely off track you follow.Although it may sound strange, it isn't hard to get into at all. Honestly, I didn't put the book down from start to finish, it was excellent! It will have you totally absorbed and leave you with a refreshed and satisfied feeling of higher understanding.If you haven't already added this book to your shopping cart... do so now!"
2,boring,"The script is clever i admit, but when it becomes a movie, it makes me fall asleep. Jacob is wooden; i do like her but she can play limited roles, very limited. (Although, actually in this movie, this is not important completely.)"
1,Pebble high,"A so-clever-it's-confusing script sinks the good actors, locations, and direction. This is the type of film that would include a very naked (and very unerotic) porn scene and play it again and again. In fact, this movie does exactly that.There's no suspense. No intellectual content. And there's no chemistry at all -- especially between the two leads, boy-next-door Pullman and delicious Irène Jacob -- who successfully overlays her French accent with a Russian one. (At least, Irene's nudity is done tastefully...more or less...)This movie aimed high and hit itself in the pebbles."
2,Spy Games,"Although I rated the movie 2 stars, I give 5 stars to the soundtrack. The plot of the movie was extremely spastic. The scenarios jumped around so much, without much cohesion, that one feels like they are spending most of the movie trying to discern what is going on and where it is leading. I enjoy movies with complicated plots, but somewhere along the line they need to be tied together. In my opinion, this one did not. I only watch movies over again when I have really enjoyed them. When this movie was over, I felt like I needed to watch it again to figure out the whole purpose. HOWEVER, this movie is worth watching solely for the purpose of listening to the 5.1 soundtrack. It has one of the best audio musical formats I have heard in a movie. In fact, sometimes the music overpowered the dialog, which, in the case of this movie, was just as well."
4,A good introduction to hiking in all areas of Great Britain.,"A good resource for both single and multi-day hikes in all areas of Great Britain. Text is divided into regional sub-sections, making it easy to match your reading to the areas you plan to visit. A fair number of the most popular or readily accessible hikes in each region are thoroughly described. A biblography at the end of each regional section recommends sources of more detailed information about walking in a given area. Detailed listing of ""support services"": food, lodging, transportation for each listed walk.The book is small sized, and easily packable, yet the print is easily legible and the pages sturdy enough to withstand traveling and frequent referencing.A good starting place for hikers not familiar with the area."
4,Absolutely recommended for your walking trip in England!,"This book provides information on numerous walks, both long and short distance, in England, complete with maps, daily distance recommendations, accommodation. A great core guide to help plan your excursion and take with you."
5,My husband & I have given over 20 of these books as gifts.,"I read this book back in 2006 when my family was going through a rough time. Never in a million years would I have believed that my husband would pick up the book and enjoy it as much as I did. We began writing ""angel letters"" on a daily basis to help guide us and comfort us. It is now 3 years later and although we no longer write on daily basis, we talk with the angels on a daily basis and ask for their help and guidance. We started giving away the books to people that we felt would appreciate what it had to offer. One of the first was to our son, who after reading it, said it was the best gift he had ever received. A few people read the book and were wary of it. The majority loved it and included the angels in their everyday lives. There is no doubt in my mind that they are there waiting to help and guide....you just have to ask, believe, and trust that they are."
3,No different than Doreen Virtue Info,"I bought this book with hopes of connecting with my angels but it didn't happen, and that was 6 months ago. Believe me I followed the instructions but nothing seemed to work as they stated in the book. I even contacted Trudy in May and to date still have not received a response by email. I guess she's too busy making money and not particularily interested in those who have purchased the book and would really like help with the whole process.If you decide to purchase this product just beware you are on your own when it comes to the whole process. Good luck to those who buy this book now, cause you won't get any extra help."
1,Is this spirituality?,"The idea that there are really angels out there, and one is assigned to take care of us, is an extremely childish idea. All you have to do is look at the devastation around you, the pain and the needless suffering to convince you that it is not so.One can ask angels anything, we find out in this booklet, from a house to a car, a girlfriend or even a parking spot on a busy day.This is not materialism, the authors inform us, it is self-empowerment. With this nonsense, modern American spirituality has touched rock bottom. I just hope this is a fad that passes through quickly. Certainly the angel of the two authors has delivered big! With their terminal cheerfulness they have touched the life of many innocent American souls and vastly expanded their bank account."
5,Love it!,This book changed my life 10 years ago. Read it in Spanish and recently bought it in English for my husband. Love it. :)
5,"This book is inspirational, informative, and a joy to read.","This book has allowed me to come in full contact with my guardian angel. I have read this book at least five times becaue the book is so inspirational and beautiful to read. I would reccomend this to anyone, including someone who has no spiritual backround."
3,"Unbranded, this is a good phone","I have an unbranded N75 with the wireless Bluetooth feature not available on the AT&T version (as of Sept 2007). I love Nokia phones - the phone works well as a phone. The Symbian OS has some really useful applications available on line. I highly recommend purchasing them on your computer, and then installing them via Bluetooth or included cable so you don't loose them on a firmware update. Bluetooth Stereo MP3 is well integrated with the phone features, but on my phone the audio can be choppy (appears that either the phone or Bluetooth get's busy interrupting the music). If Nokia cleaned up the stereo choppiness I'd give this 5 stars."
1,Nokia N75,The Phone came in with some scratches. It was supposed to be a brand new phone but I received a refurbished product. I don't think it's Amazon's fault but they need to maybe use a different supplier when the product says new and they ship out a refurb. Also the Phone will not let me send out any picture messages and once I have more than one voice message it will not send me a notification that I have another message that comes in. The phone will also lock up and I have to take the battery out and restart it. I like the design of the phone I just don't like the way that it was not new.
1,Bad..Ok one more time; pay attention this time- BAAAAADDDD!!!!!!,"Worst make of Nokia...I guess N3310 was far better than this one...No battery life...No internal phone memory..and even if u add a memory card, u cant transfer anything from it to the phone memory as it is very less...no ringtone compatibility- the nokia tools sucks big time and doesnt know wat to encode into from a normal mp3...voicemail feature not proper...Camera is ok...Ringtone volume of those in there already is good..But overall, STAY AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY FROM THIS PHONE!!!!! LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE...GOD BLESS U!!"
1,Nokia N75 lasted 16 weeks,"The Nokia N75 lasted me only 16 weeks, still works but the open and closing Hinge broked and it's hanging in 2 pieces, I spent $199.99 with a 2 year contract but guess what NOKIA said the phone was dropped, but I was especting that, that's the way out for them, there is no signs of physical damage in the phone, but you can't win...Now I got myself a recent model of motorola phoneDO NOT BUY THIS ITEM..."
2,I lost my money,"This phone is a refurbished phone, the battery is not original and now no longer works, turns itself off with just a few minutes of use"
3,about the phone?,"This phone its excellent no doubt about it, the price the gadget, the size exactly the best..the only problem that i encounter is the volume. The volume its okey if you wanna use for Music its greats that true people make comment on this phone their right,sometime even what kind of product their always comment..my comment is the volume, is somebody call you up or call somebody else the volume is not compatible on your ears is to Low bearly you cannot understand about their talking, maybe especially in crowded area or alot people around..you dont any idea about this problem..this only my first time encounter about this problem..i put already on high Volume ,let see to more better but still the same problem?"
1,do not buy this phone from them,"this phone is refurbished, battery is not from original, always dead with no purposes, lose of signal. i try to contact them and ask for an exchange.i mail back the phone. two weeks later, i got my phone back, and its the exact same phone i mail to them, problem not solve. i hate it"
4,Decent product for the price,"The Nokia N75 for the price less than $100 is good. The features are good, the battery seems to be okay, screen is big, sound is great, signal transmission is good - no call drops. I did observe a bug though, the battery power icon on the inside screen is misleading at times. On the outer screen it shows 1 bar, but on inner screen its almost full and after sometime suddenly gives a low battery message.Overall its a nice mobile for the offered price."
2,this is not MIT...mostly,"I first read this book when I got accepted to MIT. I have to admit that I was enamoured by the difficulty and severity of it, but in reality only a very small percentage of MIT students could probably identify with White's character. His stories are interesting, but this is not an accurate representation of MIT or it's students in general(as some of the other reviewers think it may be)."
3,The 101th way to covert your grad degree to hard cash,"A good read. Infact i finished the book in 2 straight days! Pepper White has skillfully translated his experiences at MIT in hard cash by publishing his diary. It does seem that he afterall learned to THINK and MIT.The flow of the book is easy and though the book is heavily peppered (pun not intended)with mechanical/engineering jargon it is fairly engrossing.May not interest people other than grad students or aspiring grad students.Pepper, you have tempted me into publishing my diary and earn some cash too. Thanks."
4,Author Cliams MIT is Hell,"Pepper White, a Mechanical Engineering Grad student tells of his life at MIT. Anyone who is considering gradaute study in engineering has to read this book. Anyone who is curoius about what life might be like at MIT should read this book. In summary, Pepper works like a slave for a couple of years and loses a part of himself in the process. But there is no doubt that he emerges with an education that makes him incredibly better at thinking. But really, is it worth it? Anyone who is having the Be-All-You-Can-Be-At-The-Top-Notch-Tech-School OR Settle-For-Less-And-Have-A-Real-Life debate with themselves needs this book. This book will push you to ""having a real life."" MIT sounds scary."
3,German Sheppards,"I wanted to hear Sibelius/ Finlandia, which I know and other pieces by Grieg and Sibelius which I do not done by the master practitioner. Karajan and his Berliners do not fail to give a polished flawless performance.I find after a few plays you always know whats coming down the pike.I do not know why but I feel this is great craft but not great art."
2,I took it off after 3 tanks of gas,"I bought this hoping to reduce the number of bugs splattered on the windshield while driving at night. There seemed to be a small reduction in bugs on the bottom 1/3 of the windshield but there was no noticeable reduction in bugs on the top 2/3 of the windshield. The most noticeable difference was the loss of slightly over 2 MPG. I averaged 39.9mpg over 9,000 miles without the bug deflector and 37.8mpg over 3 tanks of fuel with the bug deflector.The best indication that this bug deflector is not effective at protecting the windshield is the rain still beads and blows straight up off my Aquapel treated windshield. When I used Rainx in the past on pickups, the water almost stopped blowing off when a bug deflector was installed.If you're looking for hood protection, this deflector fits fairly well and will probably do a good job...just don't expect windshield protection."
3,hmm,honestly ...its really sad when u watch it and like it so much and then suddenly it just ends with u haveing a question mark up ur head..i liked the weird story of 2 lifes..the onse in the past and the future..its so imaginary..but there is no ending..u have to read the book to know the ending..thats sad..
5,Incredible!,"Please Save My Earth is one of the most wonderful anime's I have ever seen (and I have seen very many). The art is extraordinary, its funny, romantic, sad, and the story it very good. There is something in there for everyone. This, Shojou Kakumei Utena, Vampire Princess Miyu, and Fushigi Yuugi are the best animes (in my opinion) that I have seen so far."
4,Please Save Your Anime Collection,"This is a great OVA series. Do yourself a favor and get this one, believe me, you will love it. The story goes like this: A group of seven kids discover that they are the reincarnations of seven alien beings who had watched the earth for many years. But two of the seven harbor a secret that makes them deadly rivals. It is a story filled with interesting plot twists and a nearly incomprehesible finale. Okay...it's not that bad, but when you see it, you'll know what I mean. The DVD has an unneeded FAQ section that explains many points that are revealed in the serise. I guess it's there for those who didn't pay attention. I suggest you use the subtitled version of the serise, for the dubbing isn't excellent. But those who perfer dubs, it's not that bad. As I said before, this anime is definately worth looking at."
5,Fly Me To the Moon,"AWOSME ! Get this DVD every body.The art work and story are incredibal . I forgot to mituen the back ground music .That is al so beautifel .I love the character depth and how emotional the guys are , and that they don't make they guys look like whimps when they cry . The dubing is very well done . I loved the voice for Issei and Alice .I would sugest watching it more then once . The reincarnates gets confusing the first time .However I am sure that you'll want to watch it over and over aging .Definetly not a waist of money .- Kristina"
3,"Good, but confusing","I was quite surprised at how much I liked this. It's a story of the reincarnation of a group of human/aliens who were stranded on the moon and are coming back as as teenagers in Japan. Quite an interesting concept and story. My biggest problem, however, and I hate to admit it, is keeping track of who's who. A lot of the Japanese names sounded similar and some of the characters look similar (and there are a lot of them), so it can get confusing about who is who. Not that in the long run it makes a big difference. I have to say that the ending is quite anti-climactic too, but overall the whole experience of this anime was pretty entertaining. Maybe on more viewings more will become clear."
5,Awesome first guitar!,"I bought this for my 8 year old son. He opened it up on his birthday was so tickled to have his own ""real"" guitar! This guitar has held up and it's very durable. Of course a few strings have broken, but I expected that and they are pretty easy to change.If you are wavering about this guitar, don't. It is well worth the price."
4,Goose Bumps,"The first time i heard Earth ah run red i got goose bumps. i listened to the song until the cd got scratched and i knew the words by heart. Soon after in Florida (bicentinial bay) i saw him in concert with many other greats (capelton, vybz cartel etc). The crowd went crazy as did i. He did his thing on the same stage as those greats. A few favs of mine are uptown girl, youth dem cold, take it easy, earth ah run red, folly living, marijuana, that ghetto girl. Dont sleep on his albums."
3,Spice In Your Life,"This is my first time buying this artist's work. After listening to some of his tracks on line, I was drawn to his style, made me think of Sizzla. Very fresh, a modern take on reggae yet still displays some of the traditional beats, good conscious lyrics, strong rasta man vibes. I will definitely buy his work again."
5,Great book.,"Awesome questions that every child wants to know about their father, and things their father thinks about the child. Perfect! So glad I ordered this."
1,Wrong Book Pictured?,"This is a great gift book. I have ordered what I thought was the book pictured, which is, ""A Father's Memories To His Child."" But ended up receiving a book titled ""Childhhod Memories."" This is the second time I ordered the same book and this happened. I e-mailed the person I purchased from and still have no response."
1,MISLEADING ADVERTISING,"I was VERY disapointed to see that this book was so religious. EVERY page related to some sort of religious conversation. While I am Christian, I did not buy this book looking to tell my child about my prayer or beliefs. It is very misleading and now I have to pay the return shipping costs for this, which I am not happy about. I also purchased the Mother's Memories book by the same author and was also VERY, VERY disapointed. DO NOT buy unless you are looking for a book to discuss your CHRISTIAN beliefs... if that IS what you are looking for, then this would be a good book."
2,Nina Soraya Pointed Toe Boot,I wasnt too fond of these boots as the heel seemed a bit too short for the curve of the arch. I ended up selling them in a yard sale for about 8 bucks
5,So Sharp!,"This boot is HOT! It is very nice leather, sturdy straps, true to size, nice heel. The heel is high but not too. I only walked around the house and they were comfortable. If you have wide calfs it may not fit, mine are medium and they did zip . They are very nice boots that look like they will be fun."
5,How do you Spell Magic?,"Strunz & Farah are truly magic in everysense of the word. I bought this CD to complete by catalog of S&F and I can't stop listening to it. It is very upbeat and I really got into the last track. I believe they may have won a Grammy for this one, I think. If so, it was well deserved. Buy this disc, or even better, buy their whole catalog. You won't be sorry."
3,Ok purchase,"I bought these shoes with the intention of wearing them every day around the house. They are overall comfortable, although it took me a week to get used to them. If you have a hight arch foot like mine, this might not be the best choice: the leather is pretty tight on top and it leaves marks on my feet."
5,Tha South is Hot!,"I really enjoyed this C.D. and I would recomend anyone who is down with the South or any other region for that matter, to get this album. You will not be disappointed. It features some of the South's hottest artist (Slimm Thugg, Mista Madd, D., Lil Flip and others; With top notch production by Crazy C. , Mike B. and others. Don't sleep! This is a must buy!"
4,"Cute, simple, and great for kids.","Athough I don't have kids, I am an avid Ghibli collector and had to buy this. The characters are lovable, the plot is basic and easy for children to understand, and it's about as G rated as it could get. The animation is understandably not of as high quality as of other Ghibli movies, hence the 4 stars. And, erm, i'm an adult but didn't want to do the extra paperwork."
4,Prototype of Both MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO and HEIJI series.,"Panda Go Panda one of the early fruits of Miyazaki-Takabata collaboration is fantastic and has long been the children's favorite in Japan. It was released in 1972 as a short film in Japan sort of anime complex with other major anime movies.It was said the panda family particularly Papa Panda is the very prototype of My Neighbor Totoro and Mimi who lost her parents the prototype of Heidi successful TV series in 1974 , which later become one of the most popular Japanese animation series in Europe. Mimi reminds me of Pipi the Longstocking. But on this movie outstanding power is conferred on Panda family not the girl.Overall it is sort of inconsequential shuffle comedy just as you have seen in Zazie Dans Le Metro. Still not as great as his later work but still enjoyable. But for parents it will have a lot of guidance required. If you can tolerate some of the characters' bad or rude manners you will enjoy the movie together with your children."
4,Cute is the word you are looking for,"I picked this up for my niece and nephew (ages 4 & 5), who are both devoted ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" fans. I was pretty excited that they loved Miyazaki, and wanted to keep them interested.Well, they loved ""Panda! Go Panda!"" just as much as the other films. I was told they watched it five times in a row. Yay for Uncle Zack!Of all of Miyazaki's films, this one is truly aimed at the younger crowd. There is very little of the multi-level storytelling that you will find in his later films. The pandas (who talk, by the way. I was pretty surprised by this, as Totoro does not talk.) are bundles of cuteness. The animation is decent, with lots of bright kid-friendly colors. The DVD is great, as it offers both an English and Japanese soundtrack. (It's a good film for people learning Japanese, because the vocab is limited.) This is very rare for imported kid's films.And, I liked ""Panda! Go Panda!"" too. It's fun, light fare."
3,Your little kids will love it!,"I have the original version in Japanese. The music is a little bit monotonous, but my son who is just 18 months seems to enjoy it. The film teach some good family values, but the tempo is extremely slow, but again, my son really enjoys all those cute character scenes!"
3,"18 items--some shrot stories, some essays","This book contains 18 short stories or essays. The first two stories are the title story and Rip Van Winkle, which I read in grade school and remembered well. But I had no book by Irving in my list of books read since I only put in that list books which I read cover-to-cover, and I read those two stories in a school reader. So I read all of this book so I would have something by Irving in my list. Most of the stories or essays are not too bad, and some are quite good. All are written very starchily, with no hint of dialect or the like. Rip Van Winkle is obviously the best of the bunch, but there is other good stuff in the book, including a thoughtful account of a buffalo hunt in which the hunter has remorse for killing the buffalo he shot--something which far too many buffalo hunters did not have the good sense to feel."
4,Not a Bad Attempt,"If you were so inclined to get a complete and accurate (as much as possible) telling of the last few weeks in the bunker with Hitler then I would suggest this book and &#65533;The Bunker&#65533;. Both tell the story but The Bunker came out about 25 years ago and this book is somewhat new. They, therefore, has some different takes on this information that was available at the time of the writing. For the true World War 2 die-hard this presents an interesting opportunity to read through the two books and find the differences.Overall the book is primarily a retelling of The Bunker with a few new items tossed in. The writing is not bad and the author has been able to spice it up with some suspense and action here and there. The book is dark as there is nor way to make this subject matter anything but, so do not expect the feel good hit of the year. This is an interesting book and if you are interested in the topic or want to know more this is not a bad buy."
3,Illusions bit,A movie of a turmoil decade of the pre-new-millennium is the documented still of the epoch also some details are inaccurate dealt with humiliating mere economic and technical levels of then USSR.
4,Embryo - 'Invisible Documents' (Disconforme) Spanish import,"Decently assembled 2-CD live performance of a previously unreleased 1974 Embryo concert. Just five tracks, spanning over a duration of 112 minutes. Best two cuts here are the twenty-minute title track ""Invisible Documents"" and the (almost) too lengthy 39-minute ""Singing"". Noticed that some of the solos through out this title went on just a bit too long. Nonetheless, it's a good find. Most fans would consider this live CD to be 'progressive jazz rock'. Line-up: Roman Bunka-guitar,sax&vocals, Christian Burchard (Embryo's only constant member)- drums,marimba&vocals, Edgar Hofmann-violin&sax and Norbert Domling-bass. Worth checking out."
5,Loser,I think that this was a great read for everyone! The author has great taste in story telling and i cant wait to read more of his books!!!?
4,A must read for all teachers!,"I would hope that all teachers would read this book, because it shows how devasting their remarks can be. The hero is a happy, cooperative young man who has been dubbed ""Loser"" because his handwriting is terrible, he works slowly in school, and he doesn't always get the jokes of others. Contrasted to his very supportive family are the elementary teachers who make destructive judgements about him. There is one great example of an empathetic teacher. The ""loser"" ultimately makes an attempt to be a hero, and readers will find out if he survives."
4,Loser,"""Loser"" is agreat book that shouldn't be missed by kids of all ages. It's about a kid named Donald Zinkoff, who loves life and school, but can't get anything right. He has atrocious handwriting, he's not to smart, and he's one of the nerdiest kids you'll ever come to meet. The book takes from his early years, to middle school. It's a nice, easy read for everyone who can, and will make you giggle many times. It's one of the most fun times I've had with a book."
4,a fantastic book for kids with a large imaginations! BLS,"This book is about a kind and helping boy who trys to fit in with the crowd. Throughout his school days he has never missed a day except for one and that day is field day. Field day is the day where the compete and race. He always seemed to ruin things for the other players so he got booed, he got stared at,and a bunch of kids even called him a loser. So when the next field day came he did not go to school.While ditching school he went to this old ladies house and had a peanut butter and pretend jelly sandwitch. while there he realizes that it probably takes him as much time to go to school as to got from one end of the kitchen to another for the old lady. As the day went on Zinkoff had already left the old ladies house and had seen all the kids race to there homes.so read this book you wont regret it."
4,Outstanding Book NT,"This was a great book for its heartwarming tale as Zinkoff the adventurer tries to be a winner. Because he loses at everything. Some people can relate to Zinkoff of how he has no friends in a time of his life. Also as he can not get anything right. This is a story about a boy who is lost in his own world and can't come back, metaphorically. His clumsiness is like a disease. No one likes him because he is weird and at times doesn't act normal. On the inside he is very nice, but no one seems to notice that."
4,"quite good, but confusing!","In the begining, the book's quite confusing. I don't knowif the ""children"" are dogs because Jerry Spinelli called the children ""pups"". But read on! It soon gets very interesting. Something bad about this book is that it doesn't end, the story doesn't get finished. I wish there was a LOSER II! Some parts are a bit confusing too, you may need to read a sentence a few times to understand its full meaning. Overall, Jerry has written a fantastic book!"
4,Loser,"You should recommend this book,because it is a middle school book. Another reason why you shall recommend this book is its a fiction book if you like reading fiction books. Also if your favorite storyteller is Jerry Spinelli. Another reason,is that its a interesting bookfor example,its one of those books if you start readind it you have to finish it,its that interesting."
4,LOSER,"The book Loser by Jerry Spinelli is a very good book. It's about a boy named Donald Zinkoff when he's starting kindergarten all the way to the fifth grade. He has many problems such as: clumsiness, bad flute playing, uncontrollable laughing, and he has an upside down valve in his stomach which makes him throw up all the time. During kindergarten through the fourth grade noone notices his problems.But when fifth grade approaches everyone, their big kid eyes have already grown in. Then everyone starts to notice how weird this Zinkoff kid is, and he has no friends. Then one very important day (Feild Day) kids had to split up into groups for races. Some of the races were just for fun, but the last race was the real one. Zinkoff's team was in the lead until he ran. They lost the big race. That's when everybody starts calling him... If you want to find out his new identity, if he ever makes friends, or ever wins a race you're just going to have to read this book."
1,Jerry Spinelli's Loser is definitely a loser. - NINA,"Loser is about a boy named Zinkoff. He is like any ordinary kid. He talks, laughs, and has fun. Different kids like to describle him as being a loser but he does not want to hear it. Loser is a hard book to follow,you should not waste your money on it!"
2,Loser Left Much To Be Desired,"Loser by Jerry Spinelli could have been an interesting and overall good book but, in my opinion it was not because it was rushed and undeveloped. The book chronicles the life of Donald Zinkoff from his first day of kindergarten to his last day of eighth grade in a mere two hundred pages. Thus no grade is well developed and neither is any character but the loveable loser and main character Donald Zinkoff. This book was attempting to give a good message about the life through school of a loser. Because it is hard to go through your time in school with out true friends or any real interests to speak of let alone to be unatheletic on top of it. But although the message was no doubt an outstanding one, it left much to be desired as a whole."
2,check this out,This book is fiction and it tells about this kid who is not really noticed and this kid has an annoying laugh. His name is Zinkoff and he is always happy. He can't do anything right but he knows that he tries his best all the time so if he loses a game or something he doesn't get mad. That's what makes it so funny so it's a very good!
2,"This book was really stupid, and at times, sad","This book was extremely boring. There is no one plot, it's just a kid growing up as a loser, and he finally realizes he's a loser and he sort of proves his worth in the end. Not too interesting. There were a few sad parts, but most of it was forgettable."
4,Loser is a great book.,"The story loser by Jerry Spinelli is a realistic fiction book. It tells about the life of Donald Zinkoff going from first through sixth grade. At first, Donald seems to be silly, clumsy and a bad speller, but then when he reaches fourth grade, his friends begin to see him as weird and strange. During Field Day in fourth grade he causes his team to lose a race because he is a slow runner. His friend Hobin tells him ""you're a loser. A stinkin loser"". After that all of his classmates starts calling him loser. At the end of the book he hears that his friend Claudia is lost in a blizzard, he has a big heart and goes looking for her. Will Donald find her and became a hero?I enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who has been teased in the past. Donald showed me that no one is a loser. He likes himself for who he is and doesn't try to change for other people. Finally, the book loser gave me a better understanding of the harm that bullying does to other kids."
5,Loser is not a loser by stephanie M,"Jerry Spinelli is an amazing athuor.The book loser is not a loser because everyone has been teased about something ther not good at.The story is about a boy named Zinkoff,Donald Zinkoff, who in the begining of the story is 6 years old and by the end of the story he 11 and in the 6 grade. In between that time he experinces alot of good and bad things and adventures.But why should I ruin the surpries of the book.If you want to know what happens to Donald Zinkoff you have to read the book (Loser) yourself."
4,Zinkoff the Loser,"""I'll be going to my best friend's house one of these days.""Have you ever noticed that strange kid who can't do anything right?Yet, he still keeps a smile and just shrugs it off. Donald Zinkoff is one of these kids.He laughs at crazy words like zipper-zooey, he keeps bubble-gum for luck and he has an upside down valve in his stomach.No one really notices him until fifth grade. His team loses a big race because of him and he is now known as loser. Even though this happens, when one of his friends disappears in the middle of a blizzard he jumps to the rescue.How can Donald get through life now? Can he save his friend, or will he need saving himself? Now don't take the easy way out and ask a friend. You'll have to just read the book.This funny and enjoyable book by Jerry Spenelli is one I would definitely recommend. I absolutely loved it! I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys reading about weird kids doing funny things."
1,Where's the ending?,"The whole way they wrote the book was well done, untill I got to the ending. I was waiting for the ending to come up, and maybe even a happy ending, but no. When our teacher read it to us in class, there was the abrupt, unhappy sentance that stated that he was a lonely loser or something, and she said it was the end, and I was shocked. There was no sense of resolution. Don't waste your money! It's not good as it looks, and it's just depressing."
1,"Horrible,two thumbs down!!","I think that the title of this book describes whats inside!I found the book horrible,and stupid!Nobody should pick this book up!!Especially if you don't hae time to waste!"
1,LOSER,"this book is about a little boy who is ablivious to the bullies in his school. while the pages turn and the chapters change so does he. he gets older and he starts to relize what people think of him. the little boys name is donald, zinkoff, or ""loser"". zincoff loves to go to school, he loves te waiting man, and the ""Hey mailman"" lady. after the book goes on zinkoff realizes he's not the fastes and he not the best. but Zinkoff finds out the hard way. this book brought me tear... it brought me laughs. this book might be sad but it's amazing."
2,Plotless,"SpoilersLoser seemed to be going somewhere at first, but nothing really seems to happen. There's not a conflict throughout the book. He's happy being who he is, although he doesn't have any friends. If the conflict was about how the other kids changed, why did the author only introduce the basketball kid at the end? If I had to draw a plot chart for it, it would be almost flat. I liked the characters, but nothing happens to them."
4,Loser,"It was a good book. The ending was a little confusing, though. Th author really described Zinkoff and told everything he knew about him."
1,Did Not Enjoy it,Every body thinks it's a great book and recommend it but i just didn't enjoy it so i didn't finish the book!
5,LOser Review,"Jerry Spinelli is a great author. One of his books is called Loser.Donald Zinkoff is a plain loser. He is kind of weird. He is the kid that takes everything seriously. He doesn't understand when people are being sarcastic. The book takes you through Zinkoff's elementary years.Have you ever heard of an upside-down valve? It is in your stomach and if it's a upside down you vomit a lot. That is what Zinkoff has. Thankfully, they get it fixed.I don't want to give away too much of this great book, so I am going to have to keep you in suspense about what happens in this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
3,Loser,"I enjoyed this book because the author did a good jobcreating the mood of a lonely kid. He made it clear that Donald was a wierd kid. Spinelli also did a exceptional job on using his imagination.The first few chaprers were horible. All it talked about was losing and the summer. The worst part was how he refered to the kids as pups.I think Spinelli did a good job creating the poor, country style setting. You could tell there were'nt many ""thugs"". He also did a good job on the conflict. You knew Zinkoff wasn't a popular kid and didn't have many friends."
3,Ok Book,This book reminded me of the movie Napolien Dynamite. It did not have a plot. It just talked about what was happening during his life. My favorite character was Claudia!
4,Loser,"This book was very interesting and had lots of twisted parts involved. The book also talked about real life conflicts, like when the main character Zinkoff lost some races, couldn't go to school, and was always throwing up. No one every really noticed him and he didn't fit in with most people at school, and around his neighborhood. I liked this book because it had a unique way writing. Some parts I disagreed with, like when kids at school would make fun of Zinkoff for something he couldn't change. I would recommend this book to a teacher so he/she could read it to their class and then all the kids could have their own opinions. To find out what happens at the end go and read the book for yourself."
1,THIS BOOK STINKS,"Why do people like this book? It's not realistic at all. I am personally a kid and I have not run away from home once. Oh, and the details are way too long. I mean whole chapters are just unimportant details without anything happening at all. Parents, if you are thinking about buying this book, it had better be for a coaster."
1,boring,"I felt sorry for my daughter this past Summer. She picked this book out of a list of 5 to read for school. The writing was all over the place, the plot went nowhere. Really boring.zzzzzzzzzzzzzz......."
1,Never Again!,"Never again will I read a Jerry Spinelli book. this guy is clueless!I hated this book, it should have been called the : the dumbest book ever! it should have had a warning on it: don't read me. I'm not only boring, but stupid and don't make sense.Everytime I see a spinelli book I put it back on the shelf at stores. Louis sachar is the true meaning of an authur.I'm more mad I waste my time reading this most likely to go in the trash book.the book is about a boy name zinkoff whose classmate says he's a looser , but with the Blah, blah blah. looser is the first and the last spinelli book I will read . Get a grip mr.spinelli.I know this book could have been better......if Louis sachar, ann m. martin, or norma fox mazer( even I could have been a better authur and I suck at being an arthur.) was the authur.as for spinelli never again will I read such a stupid book.I wish I could give it zero stars too."
2,"""Loser"" is a Loser","Jerry Spinelli didn't do to well on the book ""Loser."" This book talks about all the different things that Zinkoff, the main character in this book, does in school and at home. Basically, it talks about the life of a loser. I think that this book was not as great as the other books that Jerry Spinelli wrote. In his other books, he talkes about people that are different. In this book he does talk about that, but he doesn't tell us why this different person was important in the lives of the people around him. If you do like books about different people, and why you should treat them with respect, then I would recommend you read ""Stargirl"" or ""Maniac Magee."" Those are also great books that Jerry Spinelli wrote. I would not read ""Loser."""
4,Pretty cool,"Books alright not bad has some interesting points but some parts get a bit confusing, but again over all its a great book"
4,Loser,It was a really great deal sends it is a surprise to me in the beginning. So you should read this book.
3,A Book You Can't Put Down,"The book Loser is a very good book to read. At first i thought it would be very boring, but after we got past a couple chapters it turned out to be a good book. Donald Zinkoff played a very good role in this book. It was both funny and sad.-MM"
4,Stephanie at Richview Middle School,"The story is a about a boy named Donald Zinkoff, who never really fit in. By the third grade he realized what his true name was ""Loser"". Donald is not very athletic ,so naturally he hates Field Day. In the races in field day,he comes in the very last place. Later on a little girl named Claudia runs away . So Zinkoff goes and looks for her through sleet,snow ,and the bitter cold. He did this for seven hours.they eventually find her and him. When he's in sixth grade,there is a basketball game. Although basketall is his favorite sport he's not very good at it and everyone knows that. Yet Bonce a very athletic boy picks him to be on his team."
4,Pretty good book,I like action books the most but I liked this book because it ends pretty good and plus I did an author study so on to my next book but pretty good book any way
2,loser,at first i did not like the book but now that i learned more it is tight! IT is but i give it a 2
2,This Book is NOT Very Good,It's about a boy who started out in kindergarten. He found out that he would be in school a long time. He had a problem and through-up every were any given moment.The only thing i liked about this book is that it had a somewhat ok plot. And it it's about a boy and his life.The main thing i didn't like this book because it was pretty dull and boring. I fell asleep most of the time i started to read it. If you realy realy realy like books that you might think it's ok. It just was not like somthing in real life... but it was not a good fictional story also.This book was not very interesting. It was pretty much like if you HAVE to read a book for i'd say ok. But if you wanna read it for fun... i wouldn't if i was you.
4,One of the best books i've ever read!!,In this book there is a boy named Donald Zinkoff. He has just now started the first grade. He is not fitting in very well he does everything that he is told to do by the teacher and he is always getting picked on and teased so school was not his favorite part of the day. He has a big problem where he has no friends and is not fitting in he is being made fun of and teased very much. I think that his book is a good book and i recomend that you should read it.
2,Meagan's review,No I did not like this book because it's not about something I like. The only books I like are about horses and this book had nothing to do with horses. I choose to read this book because it's by one of my favorite authors and I have read a couple of Jerry Spinelli's books before.This book is about a boy called Donald Zinkoff . He is a loser at everything including relay races and playing the flute. He also laughs a lot and he also likes to run away from home. He's not actually running away he's actually going for a walk. In the winter he goes out looking for this little girl called Claudia. But Claudia gets found by 8:00 and Zinkoff doesn't know that. When Zinkoff isn't back by 8:00 his mother and father are worried. The snowplow guy has Zinkoff hop in his truck and he takes Zinkoff home in his truck.Any body that likes books by Jerry Spinelli books you might like this one.
3,Be Who You Want To Be,"I just finished the book Loser, and it gave me some ideas, like be who you want to be. In the book it is about a kid named Donald Zinkoff. He never got picked on `til [...], because he lost a race for field day. Ever since, he has been called a ""loser"".I feel sad for him, because he won a trophy for soccer and somebody stole it. In my head, I thought Zinkoff was going to die, because he was out in the cold looking for a little girl, and Zinkoff had a flashback. The main idea I got from this book is ""be who you want to be"". If people call you a loser, so what? I thought Loser was a good book."
5,*sniffle**sniffle**Heart Warming!!!,"As the critics said, Donald Zinkoff is one loser who win will plenty of hearts! This book has simple language structure and writing unlike many other of Jerry Spinelli's book but its no less superb! The story line features a boy named Donald Zinkoff who's like any other kid at his age but as he grows up he realizes that he's actually labeled a loser. But he doesnt seem to care! This book is about his heart warming life from 1st to 6th Grade. You read as he matures from a little, cute and adorable sounding kid to a 6th grader. Donald Zinkoff has a very kind heart and you'll learn that anyone can, one very cold and winter night, become a hero! DeFiNetELy ReCoMMenDeD!!!"
3,My review of loser,"This is a book about an average boy and his travels from first through sixth grade. He's a normal normal kid just like you and me- that is until fourth grade. In fourth grade Donald Zinkoff becomes a ""loser"". He just the same as he was before, same incessant laugh when he hears a funny sounding word, same goofy name, same everything. His classmates are just realizing how silly this kid is. Donald may be called a loser but he doesn't let that get him down.I would recommend this book to kids ages eight-thirteen. It is contemporary realistic fiction and is a good easy read. Read this book and find out more about this silly little boy and what he does to become a hero!Allie"
5,loser review,I think this book is enjoyable. I also think it makes readers pay attention better because it's easy to understand. I think it is a perfect book for kids.Rachael L
2,Don't wear in water,"I purchased these for my son to use when fishing. They fit fine and look fine. They are listed as waterproof, but they started leaking the second time he wore them."
3,Rubber Rain and Garden Boots,The one that was delivered to me is not the same as the one in the picture.I think it's a women garden boots. I shipped it abroad for a friend. And this was his feedback. Sorry.
1,Poor durability from the start,"My boots came with insoles that were so thin and flimsy they didn't stay in place when putting the boots on or taking them off, making for uncomfortable folds under my feet. Worse, I bought them in the spring, and by halfway through winter the seams on the backs had split at the ankle, letting water and cold air in.On my next pair of wellies, I'll spend more and hope for better results."
4,Rubberized boots,"These boots are effective for their price. I used them on a Boundary Waters Canoe trip and they were in and out of water/mud constantly for a week. They held up just fine. They have a thin lining, not really for warmth, just to aid in removing. These are heavy boots. This would be a poor choice for extended hiking as your feet will feel the weight. But they proved to be durable and absolutely no leakage. Many portages, and they stood up."
5,VERY COMFORTABLE,"I ordered these boots for some major pressure washing jobs based on the previous 5-STAR reviews. I totally agree with the ratings. These boots are excellent quality and are the most comfortable rubber boots I've ever owned. For all the vanity prone, including myself, they really look cool, too."
2,Large and not well-made,Was about 1 size too large. The rust color on the side runs into the black in one spot. They were expensive for such a cheaply made boot. They looked nicer in the picture than they do in reality. Buy a cheap work boot instead. I am keeping them just because they are too expensive to ship back. I will have to wear them with two pairs of socks. I should have ordered from Zappos with free retruns.
1,Junk...,"I wore these boots for about 6 weeks before the lower rust colored sole separated from the black upper and they began to leak. Western Chief gave me no support citing funky and rigid customer service policies. Fortunately, Amazon gave me my money back. If you like wet feet, these are for you."
1,"Not waterproof, but...","These boots are excellent for:- Bengals fans- Those looking to make a fashion statement at the promBut if you are looking for waterproof boots - look elsewhere. First time they were used, walking in 2 - 3 inches of water, they let water in through the soles and got my socks wet.Move along, nothing to see here..."
1,disappointed,"Very, very disappointed with the seller. The product arrived before the actual arrival date, however, the condition of the box was bad, it was old and broken!. The watch looks used but I paid for a new one.JT"
5,An absolute must read for all practicng physicians,Very little literature exists that explains in succinct and understandable terms the legal and financial aspects of joining or leaving a medical practice. Medical Pracice Divorce accomplishes this difficult task in a superbly written fashion. It should be read by all physicians who are nearing the completion of their residency or already in practice.
2,PCAT Success 2004,"I took this test earlier today (10/25/2003) and found this book to be useful for preparing in the Verbal, Quantitative and Chemistry sections. The Reading Comprehension was significantly more difficult than the passages/questions given in this book. Many questions on the actual exam were ""What did the author infer from ""...."" in the passage"". Also, on the actual exam, be very careful with your time management in the Quantitative section since there are 65 questions in about 30 minutes. The Biology was not all Anatomy and Physiology questions that the practice test in this book had. That section is not represented very well for the actual PCAT. Overall, this book is good but should be supplemented with other books for practicing test questions."
1,Obviously written by those unfamiliar with the PCAT.,This is a horrid book. The questions are nothing like those on the PCAT. I was very disapointed. Avoid this book at all costs.
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS,"ok, this book is not all that great compared to others, like barons'(yeah, that one's good).Some of the answers are wrong so it can confuse you-the studier.ok, some questions did help, but the ones with incorrect answers kept me frustrated, and this frustration clouded my mind and intervened with my thought process and studying.if you can, find another book to buy, unless you're loaded."
3,It's ok,"It is cheap and I would return it as it was a waste of my money.Although, my daughter loves it even if the arms fall off.It was her gift and she can keep it but I will not buy this product again."
2,The Bratz doll without arms,"I have never written a review before, but I wanted to save another parent the money. Yes, this doll is fun to look at, and easy to pose, if you like a doll without arms. With every movement, her arms kept falling off. Frustrated, my daughter finally named her Matty, and used another Bratz doll for the dress."
2,trendy and lame,"This album is all indie cred with no substance to back itup. The songwriting and production are weak and predictable, with nosense of dynamics. END"
2,Nope!,This Keating CD didn't get me too excited. He has done so much better than he did on this one.
3,PHOTO SMART 6220 DIGITAL CAMERA DOCK,THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT IT DIDN'T FIT ON TOP OF MY NEW HP m7690y DESKTOP COMPUTER.
5,Great read Great author,Wonderful summer read. This book grabs you on the first page. Mr. Conley provides characters who are true to the period.
4,Three,"To be honest, I only read the book because it was suggested by a close friend. And to my surprise, I loved it. The author has a deceptively simple style of writing. I was drawn in by the various plot twist and turns. I recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and good writing. I was also surprised to know how big a fan base he has and further how connected he is to them."
2,Not worth your time,"I picked this book up at a local library sale for a quarter, and I think I may have overpaid. I had never heard of the book, but the plot synopsis on the back was enough to get me to ante up 25 cents. As I began to read the book, I immediately disliked Dekker's writing style. As for the plot itself, it was just weird from the beginning, but not in a good-weird way. The exchanges between the protagonist and his childhood friend were strange and un-engaging. I can usually knock out a book in 3-4 days, but this one took me over a month, as I was never in the mood to pick it up. The plot device used at the end for the final twist was predictable and lame. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It's not horrible, but there's so many better books out there that you shouldn't waste time on this one."
5,twisted and good,"Ted Dekker knows how to write a so called ""page-turner"" book. This was the first book by Ted Dekker I have ever read.And it is also now my favorite book ever. Reading this fun,twisted,and exciting book has encouraged me to track down other books by Ted Dekker. This book is about a man named Kevin who gets a phone call from a guy named Slater. Slater tells him he has 3mins. to confess his sin,or his car will blow up. Kevin tries to do the right thing before something or some one gets hurt. If you don't like long books this book goes by in a quick flash. The ending is definitly worth the wait!"
3,Something Different,"After looking at about 25 other reviews, I had to weigh in with my own two cents worth. The book is very well written, and the story line does keep the reader in suspense. However, when the 1st hints at the ending started, I began to have my doubts. I thought, no way will that be how it ends, but boy was I wrong. To get to the ending by connecting all the earlier parts just did not work for me. Early descriptions of phone calls, etc. just made the ending too unbelievable. I can generally enjoy a book even if the ending is not what I expected and often the unexpected is what makes a book, but in this case, the ending totally destroyed the story. I actually wanted to throw the book as far away as I could the moment I saw for sure where the author was going with it. I'm sorry, people, and I love Mr Dekker's other books, but I would not recommend for anyone to read this one."
5,thr3e,This was very AWESOME book. It will have u on the edge of ur seat the whole time. This is a book u will never forget. This is must read. Just starting to read Showdown will have a reivew on it soon.
5,One of my all-time favorites,"This book has it all: good writing, suspense, drama, great characters, and intelligent, thoughtful theological arguments. If you like to read books that are: unpredictable and make you think, then read this book. You won't be able to put it down, and you won't be disappointed. This author is a treasure, can't wait for the next book, and when will they do a movie? It's that good!"
5,The best book I've read this year!,"I have to be honest here...this is the best book I've read this year, and I've read a ton of them. One thing: this one bears several similarities to a recent Hollywood thriller that came out a couple of months ago, so the ending was a little familiar. However, since I know it takes a long time to write a novel, I have no doubt that Mr. Dekker was working on this even before that movie came out. Still, this is a major thriller, and I have to say that it remains tense throughout. It's very easy to see this one as a possible movie someday, and you can tell Ted's really coming into his own with his voice as a thriller writer. I highly recommend it!"
4,Epic!!!!,"This book is absolutely awesome! Ted Dekker is such a great writer, and his books never ceacecto amaze me. If you're into suspense, and mystery, this book is definitely for you!"
3,Not his best,"I am a fan of Ted Decker. Once I start his book I can't put it down...full of thrills, action and mystery. I found this one had less impact then his others. I would still recommend it but read his others."
2,Not impressed,I honestly didnt even finish the book. I got a little bored and was able to determine who was what and where. I was told the book was great but I was slightly disappointed.
1,Huge disappointment,"I'm a Ted Dekker fan. ""Blink"" is a great read, and I enjoyed ""Heaven's Wager"" as well. I started reading ""Thr3e"" with high expectations -- and was utterly disappointed with this lame effort from Dekker. I felt compelled to write, if only to refute the puzzling rave reviews I've read here at Amazon.com about this book.Early on in the book, I guessed where the ending was headed. I hoped I was wrong, but unfortunately I was right. It's a plot ending so implausible, so disappointing, so darn stupid it's hard to put into words. I won't go into detail, but believe me -- it's an ending fit for a cheesy late night cable TV movie. My brother, mom and a good friend all read this book too -- we all had the exact same reaction to the ending.Read ""Blink"" if you want to read a great Dekker novel, with some interesting Christian theology tossed in for good measure. I can't stop you from reading ""Thr3e."" But please check it out of the library -- don't waste good money on this dreadful tale."
1,Ridiculous book,"Why is this popular??? I don't understand why people read it.The theme of good vs. evil played a part that would have been important, if it had been developed. Sadly, it wasn't.The ending is so far from reality that it's not something that anyone can identify with or will experience. We can't use it to mentor friends or even to grow as people ourselves. It's simply so ridiculous that it wasn't worth writing about.When it came to writing conversation (especially when the characters were looking back to their childhood), Dekker presented it in an awkward fashion. Maybe he hasn't spent time with ten- or eleven-year-olds lately, but they simply don't talk or think like that.The book dragged on and on, focusing on details that were not only unnecessary but also dragged out the tale needlessly. The only, only, ONLY reason that I finished the book was that I kept waiting for something to happen. I was disappointed. Now, I'm angry that I wasted my evening reading such drivel."
1,Disappointed reader,"This is the first book that I have read by this author. Yes the book is suspenseful and yes it holds your attention; however, I was sadly disappointed with the mind game. I won't go into that further so as not to spoil it for any potential reader."
5,For thinkers only,"There are exactly 100 reviews for this book before mine. Fewer than 5 are less than 4 stars and most, like me, agree that this book is exceptional. What does that say about the others? It's amazing to me that anyone would not like this book except for one reason, and that is they don't like the premise the author uses for theological reasons.I, on the other hand, think it's perfect for the story. Unconventional, yes, but that is even better. A must read for any thinker who is open minded. Would make the perfect movie!"
1,Disappointing,"I picked up Thr3e mainly because it was listed as a Christian suspense and the blurb on the book sounded interesting. It was interesting at first, but the ending was totally unbelievable. One week after the finale with Slater, he is basically all right and will just need a ""little"" therapy? Also, Jennifer, the FBI agent, who is falling in love with him is going to serve as his psychotherapist? That's professional :)This was the first book I've read by Ted Dekker; I don't know that I'll be reading any more."
1,Skip it,"Others have given away the preposterous plot gimmick the author employs.A good mystery gives the reader enough information (however subtly) to solve the mystery before the last pages. This stinker pulls a ridiculous rabbit out of the hat instead. Don't waste your time.Oh, yeah, a guy with multiple personality disorder blows up his own car, a city bus, and a university library. But he had a tough childhood, and no one got hurt, so the presumption at the end is he will be acquitted. Sure........More unbelievable coincidences than you can shake a stick at. I want people who can guess this well standing behind me next time I play blackjack."
3,I am so glad this book is,"over. The writer brings you through so many emotions just to give you an ending that makes you say ""what?"""
3,Gripping but with serious shortcomings,"I kept hoping Three would pull through and offer a satisfying surprise ending--or just satisfying would have been okay; however, Dekker did just what I feared and took the easy way out...wrapping everything up in a neat little magical package that left me thinking..""what a waste.""As others have reviewed, there are some exciting twists and intelligent writing in Three, but Dekker just doesn't come through with the big hit in this one. He gives things away and assumes readers will overlook several unrealistic and perhaps impossible suggestions.Three needed more investment in energy and time by the author to be really good. As it is, it is mediocre."
