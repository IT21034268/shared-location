3,Good Book,"Enjoyable read, probably one of the best in this series. The second and third books aren't bad either but from there this series just goes strait to hell! Read the first three and enjoy but after that please just give up. Trust me, it's for your own good. If you want long well written books to read I recomend Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series and Melanie Rawn's Exiles series."
2,"The same interaction, over and over.","An excellent series with one big flaw. I read through book 4, but had to give it up. Why? All of the elements were there, great alternative world, facinating creatures, arcane powers and a battle between hideous evil and flawed good.So, what was the matter? The characters always have the same interaction with one another. Always. Typical interaction involves a man, a woman and an older woman that the younger one can confide in. Woman [gets mad] at the way the man behaves, man is confused why woman is acting so [strange]. Woman gets in a huff and throws a hissy fit. Man is even more confused. Woman runs to older woman for advice. Older woman describes birds+bees and all is well again. Repeat for several thousand pages to complete series. Sometimes the genders are reversed, etc.This was all fine for part of the first novel, but eventually you want them to just move on. It's especially jarring when a older woman behaves like a teenager in this formula."
1,Don't Start. Save Yourself.,"For years now Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series has been unfolding. Actually, unfolding is too strong a word. It implies movement of some kind.Taken by itself, Eye of the World is not a terrible book. Nor is the next book, The Great Hunt. Why then does it merit one star? Because this series long ago descended into a quagmire of unresolving plot threads, unmoving story, static (but oh-so-detailed) characters and meaningless dream sequences. ....And the fact is, it's not that great a book to begin with. Here's the plot: A mysterious magic user tells a farm boy that it's his destiny to stop an arbitrarily evil force, a force which happens to reside an unreasonable distance away - on the other corner of the map in fact. If this plot does not scream ""Original"" I don't know what does.Taken by itself this book is a little padded with a rather vague climax, and not anything that special.Taken as a whole, the series is a lot padded, incredibly plodding, ..."
2,"Good for its time, a good laugh now","Reviewing a classic, it's good to remember how relevant the book was for its time. What seems a cliche now, could very well be a new/uncommon idea back in the days (1990, I believe?). With this in mind, Eye of the World undoubtedly is a good introductory book with some merit for younger readers.Reading it in 2008, however, will reward a more mature reader no more than a smile. Every character is overexaggerated and the dialogue will either make you vomit or tip over with laughter (thankfully, the second for me). The overall level of writing is below average. Even the contemporary ""gems"" like The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss will stand tall in comparison to Jordan's use of language.If you are a new reader looking for an idea of what to expect in this book/series, let me warn you - don't even start. As many had mentioned previously, the series collapse past book 4-5. Save your time and money, pick up GRRM instead."
3,Eye of the World--Lord of the Ring,"First I like this book a lot but i must point out something that bothers me. Am I the only one who noticed how close this book follows lord of the rings. Think it overI won't give the story away, but to those who read both books should know Lan is so clearly a perfect match for Aragorn that it is surprising I did not notice it the first time i read it.Thom is Gandalf without the magicMat is Pippin, think about the dagger with mat and the Palantir with PippinPadan Fain is GollumShadar Logoth is an above ground version of the Mines of MoriaLoial is an Ent, Don't be hasty as each would say He would be QuickbeamThe Green man is of course Treebeard Trolloc = OrcThe Dark one who should not be namedThose are just a few things I noticed. But I still like the book, I love the series. Please email me your thoughts on this"
1,Absolutely terrible,"This is the worst fantasy book I have ever read... derivative storyline, incredibly slow plotting (broken up by nonsensical action sequences), paper thin characters,... and my biggest complaint... a world that is not logically consistent.Only after coming to Amazon did I find out there are actually 10 of these pieces of trash out there. To people who actually read all these books, you are braver than I.My recommendations: Tokien, Glen Cook, Cherryh, George Martin."
2,Skip it if you're over 15,"I recently began a literary quest for some ""adult"" fantasy. Not pornographic, but something with meat. I guess I had high expectations for this series. A few reviewers compared Jordan to Tolkien; nothing could be farther from the truth. Jordan's ham-fisted foreshadowing takes all of the mystery out of the plot. The Orcish knockoff Trollics (how mundane is THAT name) were about as frightening as my family dog. I never felt for the characters, they never came across as real. Perhaps this is a good introduction to the genre for young readers. If you are looking for a mature fantasy series try George R.R. Martins A Song of Ice and Fire trilogy."
4,Even better the second time,First let me say that I strongly recomend this series. I have read several of the books twice.The first time I read this book I found it a little slow going. The second time I thought it was fantastic and did not understand why I found it a bit slow the frist time.The best part for me about this series apart from it being well written and exciting is that the characters are more 3 dimensional the good guys are not all good and the bad guys not all bad.I strongly recomend this series
4,The beginning saga,Very interesting story. It tends to became repetitive at times however the action flows and the endingwhets the interest. Book Two flows much better and increases the desire to continue to follow thegrowth of the protagonist Rand.
4,An excellent intro,"But be prepared to give up all other hobbies if you invest yourself in this series. It is long, sometimes pointless and often confusing.This first book was stellar. One can't help being sucked into Jordan's world and the struggles of his characters. The Lan and Nynaeve relationship is my favorite and has yet to be resolved in book eleven. Rand never goes or does what you would expect him to do and while you truely care about his plight in the eye of the world, it is a struggle to remember that several bible sized books later."
5,EXCELLENT!,"One of my fav books ever. I got my twin bro who HATES anything to do with fiction to read this book as part of a deal we made, and he went on to read the rest of the series!"
5,IT IS TERRIFIC!!!!!,"Iam am just about done this book now and am so excited! It is so cool!!! Everyone is saying the first starts out really interesting then gets kinda boring, Well at first I thought it would go on Forever, Then I really got into it and now am having a ball! I can't put it down! It is great!!!! I can't wait to read the rest!!!! YES!"
4,Nearly 5 Stars,"I started to read this book when i was in seventh grade, in 1998, and I HATED it. I couldn't force myself past the first 100 pages. I couldn't relate to the characters, or find any plot whatsoever. I recently picked it up again, and could not put it down. My only complaint would be the fact that sometimes it feels like events are overexplained, making them seem less believable. I also don't like the dreams- I know they are important, but sometimes I have to re-read them in order to understand what happened. I have yet to continue with the series (it took me forever to find a copy of *The Great Hunt*) but I hope it stays as interesting as it is."
5,The Best Series Ever-Regardless of bad Slanderous Remarks!!!,"Those who tend to belittle this great effort by Jordan, are all jack-asses. They do not appluad his efforts to create the most detailed fantasy world ever created. J.R.R. Tolkien is aslo one of my favorite authors, yet his worlds pale in comparison to both plot depth and complexity to the lovely tid-bit of good literature that Jordan offers this world. All that I can say is that if you are a true literary afficionado then I recomend reading this wonderful work. For those uneducated fools who wouldn't know a good piece of literature if it hit them in the face, then try something a little easier, such as a cat in the hat!!!!!!!!!! Get this series"
5,Butt-kicking fiction writing....,"Even if you detest fantasy, if you appreciate good writing you will adore this book. The plots are superbly crafted and the characters are chiseled to perfection. If you haven't started into the Wheel of Time, you're missing not only a remarkable literary achievement, but also a downright great story. Read it. I mean it. NOW!!"
2,I don't get it!,"I mean, I know this is suppose to be a classic of fantasy literature but I found it utterly boring. I've read Tolkien and Goodkind and found them to be much more satisfying reads. The characters in Eye Of The World were flat and I found myself not caring about any of them. This is one of those books that after you've read so long you are in the terrible situation of either giving up and deciding you've wasted your time or seeing it through to the bitter end. I wish I would've done the former because it was indeed a bitter end. Depressing. Maybe the other Wheel Of Time books are better but I'm not taking a chance with another 1000 page book by Robert Jordan."
5,A cheap chance to start a magical series,"The Eye of the World is the first in a Tolkien-like epicical series. In a world of heroes, trollocs, dragons and the like, a sheperd boy destined to be king slowly discovers his powers and his destiny. Sure, I have seen that before... But in Jordan's case the story line and the characters are so carefully crafted that you will find it difficult not to see them around you (I did in my dreams anyway). You must like stories that intertwine several story lines (but luckily there is a glossery of names at the end of each book). Good is not always good and bad has its better sides; safe to say there is much more nuance than in a lot of the fantasy I've read. There is a catch though: once starting with this first book of the series (wich has reached book 8 and is still going strong) you will be (sort of) forced to keep on wanting more... Don't say I didn't warn you!"
5,Deep into Jordan,"Welcome to the new godfather of fantasy. Jordan creates a world with so much depth and intrigue, so much color and life, that you will begin to wonder if he has not secretly traveled to a different realm and taken notes. Jordan starts his epic in the Eye of the World, and if anyone has searched for a fantasy series with a little more oomph than the normal run of the mill storylines, you will find it here. Most people might find that Jordan has copied some ideas from other authors, but the truth is that he is the pinoneer. With his completely revolutionary ideas in fantasy, from women as powerful and feared, to magic making men crazy, to sorts of powers that are imaginative and novel, this work does not disappoint in any sort of form. His writing is brillant, succint, and beautiful, his characters consistent, and his ideas so creative that you will only be itching to become part of the action. HAVE FUN!"
5,Caution,I caution any reader interested in reading the Eye of the World or any other books in The Wheel Of Time Sieres. They are Very hard to let go of once they have been picked up. So unless you have time to spare BE CAREFUL.
3,Not captivating,"Robert Jordan is obviously an excellent author. This is my first reading of his works, and his ability to describe people and events is very good. Perhaps too good for the sake of the book. While the book focuses on the development and changes in the characters in light of the events that take place, I was never able to become interested in the characters or events. Jordan describes things well, but he never grabbed me. This book came highly recommended, so I forced myself to finish it. I found myself reading until I got to a stopping point, and I never felt compelled to continue on. In a less involved book that would be livable, but in an epic of this size it is almost inexcusable. In light of the tremendous reception of this book, it is obvious many people enjoyed and will enjoy it. Don't let this blind you into thinking everyone will like it, however, because it is not, by any means, a masterpiece."
1,"O woe, woe to all that read this book","O Save us, save us from sterotypical fantasy. We've seen it all, honestly we have. A group of people eerily reminiscent of frodo and co go on a journey to destroy an evil magical being eerily reminiscent of sauron which they are haunted by the whole time. The group ends up getting split up for some reason but are magically reunited and work together to destroy the evil being almost magically. Tons of pointless filler is included in order to make the book longer until the author realizes he has a deadline to meet and does a insta-ending where by some strange form of magic the charachters travel farther than they did in the first 60 pages in the book and almost instantly destroy the evil being with as little conflict necessary in about 30 pages. All women that appear are magical beings because women are otherwise purposeless and the author doesn't want to get sued for racism if he doesn't make the females more powerful than the males. Yes, we've seen it all."
4,"Love Jordan's writing, dislike his females!","Yes, I am female, I am strong minded and hold my own. I've read more books than I can count over the past 30 years. And I hate the females in this series! I've read the first three books three times, and I can't make myself go any further. I *love* the way Jordan writes. I love to read, and his style is very engaging. But listening to females with the minds of 6-year-olds pouting and stomping about drives me completely insane. I've actually moaned out loud at the drivel that comes out of their mouths. Why can't he write something with NORMAL PEOPLE in it???"
2,dont bother starting the series,"I had heard a lot about how great the wheel of time series was, I noticed that most of the books sold very well, and saw that it was generally well reviewed, so I decided I would give it a shot. I must say that I honestly do not know what the fuss is all about. This book was average at best, with nothing that really set it apart from anything else out there in fantasy today. I just do not see any reason to invest the amount of time it will take to finish this series. Do not be fooled by the glorious reviews this book and the series in general has received. If you really want to read an original and worthwhile series then go start reading Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series."
5,One of the good ones,"Here you have the beginning of a god-awful long series that still has yet to see completion. the Eye of the World introduces the reader to Rand Althor, the hero and possibly the savior of the world. Or the doom of it. By the eleventh book you still aren't sure how it's going to go though you do hope it goes well.This book has plenty of action though it does take a bit to get going. I gave it a five star because when I originally read it, I couldn't put it down. The entire series may deserve a three star, but this one and the several following it are modern day classics of the genre.A very detailed world bursting with more intrigue and creatures than you can shake a stick at. All in all very well done."
5,May the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.,"I have read fantasy series by many authors, and Robert Jordan is the best. This is the first book in a series that has so far reached 7 books. The story is gripping, you will stay up all night reading this one. You know the characters well by the end of the first book. There are many loose strings dropped throughout, and not a word is placed accidentally. Many are tied up, but for some you must wait for the next book. An amazing story with a climactic ending thet will kep you on the edge of your seat"
5,"The most indepth, gripping, and perfect fantasy novel ever!","Robert Jordan is J.R.R. Tolkien in disguise. The characters in Eye of the World will grab you and hold you until you finish, and then they will not let go. The plot is so closely detailed to actual human experiences that you will walk away thinking about it for hours. You begin to hope and dream and fantisize along with the characters in the novel, and you begin to feel what they feel, all from the detail that Robert Jordan puts into it.The adventure is here, and alive, and it is ongoing. The plot is so involved, that you often find yourself returning to earlier chapters in an attempt to discover what will happen next. Robert Jordan truly is the next great fantasy epic writer of our century, and maybe even into the next!"
5,The Eye of the World,I absolutely love this series and I've been waiting a very long time for the last book to be released. Now that it has I will be re-reading this series for about the 6th time.
4,"Starts out a little slow, but worth the patience!","I thought the story started out a little slow, but it has a great story line and the characters are interesting. I am on book 2 now and have a hard time putting it down."
3,A Weak Beginning to an Incredible Series,"I first read this book as a sophomore in high school, and it provided exactly what I was looking for: escapism.In this re-read, it provided nostalgia and escapism. Aside from my opinion that ""Eye of the World"" is a poorly written facsimile of ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" and besides the fact that Jordan's gender stereotypes run rampant, Wheel of Time is a thrilling paragon of fantasy series. ""TEoftW"" is a tepid beginning, but as the series progresses, the world Jordan wove draws you into itself. This is a world you can believe and care for, filled with characters you admire, despise, grow with, and cheer for.I'm excited to be reading this series again, especially since the final installment is being released in a matter of days. I would suggest this book to anyone with soft spot for fantasy, epic tales, and plenty of time and tissues (I cry at least once per book) on their hands."
5,A first in the series of 7 that really gets your attention!!,"This is the first book of Robert Jordan's phenomenal series of fantasy that really catches ones attention. I could hardly waite to read the next one and the next. He follows the characters, you can pick up the next book and pick up right where you left off with the previous book. Mr. Jordan spurs your mind to see the characters, and feel the characters plight, and journeys. I found this book to be quite engrossing, and i could go back and read the book again, and again......"
2,After reading 260 pages I gave up.,"I started this book with great expectations. I have to admit I failed to read this book. I was waiting for catching up with the story line, but pages after pages it was still boring. It is completely narrative, the story is straightforward like a motorway, and the amount of excitement raising from this book can be compared to a phonebook. It is simply plain. Maybe I gave up to early (on the 260th page)."
5,Great Read,"It's a big riveting story and I enjoyed it immensely and continue to recommend it to fantasy reading friends. I think the first three books are the best, after that I think the story gets a little strained.Please stop COMPARING these books to Tolkien and Star Wars. All good fantasy writers use the same mythological, religious and sociological structures as a source, which is the ONLY similarity between Tolkien, 'Star Wars', Jordan and hundreds of other authors - which is why you see similarities between characters. Anyone who reads a lot of fantasy/science fiction will eventually figure this out!Relax and enjoy the books. I look forward to Jordan's next installment."
5,Excellently wrote. Robert Jordan is one of the best.,"The Eye of The World may be a long book, but it hooks you early, and doesn't let you go, even when the book is over. It made me go to my library and read the other seven books in the series including The great Hunt, The Dragon Reborn, The Shadow Rising, The Fires of Heaven, Lord of Chaos, A Crown of Swords, and the Path of Daggers, I can't wait for the ninth book. The charecters themselves are varied from those who you have to know what there next move is, to who want to, and will laugh at, to who you outright hate. I enjoyed The Eye of the World, I hope you do too."
3,A never ending story ?,When will it end up. I am now reading second book(in French) think it's excellent but fears will go on for ever.
3,Great fun while on an airplane,"Jordan spins an entertaining yarn. I like fantasy/sci-fi anyway. There was one thing about this book that bothered me: in the beginning of the book, the young hero's horse, Bela, is lost, presumably eaten by gobliny kinds of things, but turns up in the stables of the local inn without any explanation. I looked and looked; is this an editing goof, or did I completely miss something?"
5,Fantasy at its best!,"I've never really been a fan of fantasy. Sure, ""The Lord of the Rings"" was great, but I just can't seem to get excited about goblins and creatures from different worlds. After reading ""The Eye of the World"", however, I have discovered a whole new appreciation for the genre. The novel starts out a fast pace following the adventures of a boy named Rand and his two friends. He soon discovers that he is wanted by the ""Dark One"" the evil power who has been imprisoned for thousands of years. Rand doesn't know why, but he has to travel to the other side of his world to seek safety. What makes this book so great is the attention to detail. Jordan has really developed a complex history for his world. The reader feels as though is actually traveling through one of the many cities along the way. One of the best books I have ever read, I can't wait to start the next one!"
4,From a non fantasy reader,"I'm not a big fan of fantasy, well, I've never actually read fantasy before. I have attempted to read a couple and found that I couldn't get into it. But this book was very readable with a great pace. I didn't have to work at the book at all. For such a big book, it went by quite fast. I don't have major raves about it because it didn't hit any particular emotional or philosophical spot, but I did enjoy it. I'm now looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"Averge is a good way to sum up this book. Everything about it seemed very stock and basic, not to mention long-winded, with events that seem to take too long to unfold. The naivetee of the protagonist(s) I found to be frustrating, and the overall arcs of the characters took a frustratingly long time to develop. I really didn't feel like Jordan was offering anything really new here, and I will not read any of the other books. Check out Steven R. Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series for some really pithy, interesting and unique fantasy."
4,The Eye of the World. . . It just MIGHT be worth it. . .,"In the Eye of the World, Robert Jordan writes a very good story. I must admit, however, that the story is far better than the four stars that I have given it, yet in all honosty, compared to the second and third book, the only reason that I'd give to read it is so that you wont get hopelessly lost latter on. . . Still. . .it's a good read."
4,New Fantasy Fan,"Since listening to the Eye of The World, book 1, I have received all 11 in the published series. That alone should say how much I enjoyed listening to this book. The 2 readers, 1 male, 1 female, are pleasant and compelling to listen to, making the words of the story all the more intense. Having been a die hard Tolkien fan for 30 years, I was reluctant to delve into any other ""world,"" but Robert Jordan has made me a believer. Since this was recommended to me by my fellow Austenphile, I trusted the nod and have no regrets."
5,YOU WON'T GET ANY SLEEP,"I BOUGHT THE BOOK AFTER WORK WHEN BOTH MY MANAGER AND A.M. TOLD ME IT WAS GREAT. I ATE, THEN STARTED THE BOOK AT 9:00PM AND DID NOT PUT IT DOWN UNTIL I FINISHED AT 3:00AM. (MIND YOU, THIS BOOK IS ALMOST TWO INCHES THICK!) IT SUCKS YOU IN. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE STORY, THE BOOK IS SO VIVID. THE CHARACTERS ARE SO REAL. ANYONE WHO LIKES THIS GENRE (FANTASY-ADVENTURE) SHOULD READ THIS."
3,Typical fantasy fare,"The Eye of the World, the first book in Robert Jordan's far-too-long fantasy series, will present no surprises to long-time fantasy readers. The Dark Lord character is there, the innocent youths ar swept away from their village, the endless army of sub-human bad guys is there, the journey through distant lands, the prophesy, the youth gaining power, the learned elder, blah blah blah.Not too say this book is bad. Indeed, it's actually a pleasnt read, and ends up being *just right* for that fantasy fix - just ignore the fact that the series goes on. Unlike the rest of the books, this books actually wraps itself up at the end. Everything after book 2 ends up being a long, boring fashion show...really.Read this as an independant story, enjoy, and then run away (fast) when you see other Wheel of Time books."
5,"The king is dead, long live to the king","If you start reading this book, then you know why I entitled the review as I did. During the first 100 pages you take Robert as a mere shadow of the dead king Tolkien, but then he rises from the ashes and starts to burn with an undiminishable flame. You read this book and you know that the fantasy will never be the same to you anymore. Rand and his compannions are the most interesting and developing characters I have ever read. They start off as some kids from a village in the middle of nowhere and end up as...but that's already in the 8th book. Then comes the detail of the world, that can't be compared to any other. The intrigues of the High and the bloody wars fought by the low. And believe me, you can't stop reading the series, before you're in the end. God, give Him the strength to finish his work. You have to read it, to understand me!"
2,What's all the fuss about?,"The Wheel of Time is not badly written, just very unimaginative and a general rip-off of the whole fantasy genre. I myself hate when authors babble too much, which is clearly the case here, but even if you like that kind of thing, the book isn't _that_ good.It's a very ordinary fantasy tale with a party of heroes, all of them with Great Destinies, traipse around the countryside and try to evade evil shadow-wraiths (Tolkien), ghosts and some or other Lord of Evil. (He didn't show up in the first book, but I refuse to read another 2000 pages to meet him)They're simply not worth the number of pages you have to read."
4,Fun,"The beginning was a little slow, but as you get to know the characters, you learn to love most of them. There is wonderful use of forshadowing, in this book especially, and I only have one criticism. This is totally a male fantasy. This theme of hormones (yes hormones, not necessarily love on the guy's part) begins to run a lot deeper in the later books, and is somewhat annoying to us female readers, but overall it is a fun read. It goes by fast, adn you really get to know all of the characters. Don't be daunted by the size of the book it is a fast and enjoyable read!"
5,BEST BOOK EVER,One of my favorite books ever written. The Eye of the World introduces the reader to an incredible world of epic adventures. far better than anything Tolkien even dreamed about. I've read it FOUR times!!! A must read for any fantasy fan.
3,The first book was pretty good,"The first book was very entertaining, but extremely wordy. It is unfortunate that the rest of the serious was so bad."
2,Over Already?,"Although I enjoyed reading most of this book, it seemed to just spiral downhill towards the end. The beginning was slow, and although many parts had me holding my breath out of fear, or reading more to find the answers to intriguing questions of Rand's past, when there were only 100 pages left, I had to force myself to finish it, and by the end I was so shocked that Robert Jordan could ever call the end a conclusion, that I almost regretted picking up the book in the first place. All in all, there are equal amounts of good and bad parts in the book, so it's up to you whether you want to end the book confused and feeling unfinished to read through the good parts."
5,Addicted to the wheel,"I'm in the process of reading the whole series and have beome a dedicated 'Wheel' fan. The first book was a little difficult for me to get into at the beginning. The author goes into a lot of detail and the plot seemed to move slowly. As I continued, I realized that these details were necessary. You are taken to a different world and different time. Jordan introduces you to the characters, and each one has an individual personality that is unique in his or her own way. The three young men from Two Rivers are reluctant heros, the women strong minded.The plot weaves a story of good against evil but in a way that is different and complex. Each book creates more questions and problems that will carry you to the next volume. I look forward to the several hours a day I set aside to read Robert Jordan's series. I have discovered that his books are so popular that there is an official Wheel of Time website."
4,Wow!,"If you are in need of some serious reading material, and want to read a series of books for the next year or two, pick up this book, and start the series! You'll be glad you did!"
3,Tough but worth it,This book lost me in the beginning. The first couple hundred pages really had nothing on some of the greats. The characters and plot developed slowly and i honestly thought bout dropping it. That is something i struggle to never do. What a reader that drops it will not discover is how incredibly great the series is. The development of the characteers and plot is slow. yes but in the end it gives you a much better feeling for who the characters are. This book leads into all the others. It gives them meaning. Without it Robert might catch more readers like the one that earlier stated that he put it down three times after struggling through the first 200 pages but without it the other 8 books in the series would have no true appeal.
5,Great start for one of the best series ever,"Now, from what i've read, the only people who have read this can't see past their own nose. The intricacies of this novel go beyond anything some can see. One reviewer said all the female characters were the SAME!!!! I'm not sure if this person just skimmed the book or actually read it. I give this five stars for the perfect ending. I literally could not eat dinner until i finished it. The climax was mind-blowing, and the rising action leading to it just accentuated that point.For anyone wanting to get hooked on a series, read this. It is sure to destroy all social contact for a few days."
5,Great book!,"When I read this book about two years ago, it became my favorite. This is not a book to miss."
4,A very good read ... hope you have alot of time ...,"I sat on this book for a couple of years before reading it ... and now I wonder why. Some very strong LotR connections, but unique in it's own way. I look forward to reading more in the series (10 and counting I believe!)"
5,Look out Frodo!,"I picked up this book and just couldn't put it down. I am not a huge fanasy fan, but this book is definitly worth reading. As for the detail, I loved it! Compared to the Sword of Shanara series, this book has very little detail at all. Not having read most of the series yet, I don't know how it turns out, but the Eye of the World was great. If the rest of the books are half as good, The Lord of the Rings will be left in the dust."
5,I'm just getting into epic fantasy . . .,". . . so I can't really review this book relative to the genre, or to the rest of the Wheel of Time series. However, I can say that it's the best book of any sort that I've read in a long time. The story is heavily detailed, with plenty of action, suspense, and intricate plotting. That might seem like enough, but the key to liking a story is caring about the characters, and that's where The Eye of the World comes through in spades. Lan, Moiraine, Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve, and Thom are all likeable, fully formed people, and as I was reading I found it easy to feel what they felt (especially Rand). I give The Eye of the World my highest recommendation. I'm going to read the next book in the series, The Great Hunt, as soon as I can."
4,great fantasy adventure,"This book is a great fantasy adventure book. A little on the lighter side of Tolkien of course, but a quick read and very entertaining. I like how Jordan's world is set up; a good riff on the basic fantasy formula. I read the second book as well and it seemed to start dragging a bit, but this book was excellent."
4,The fantasy journey,"As in the LOTR, you take a group of characters and they must make an adventerous journey from their simple homeland to a climatic destination. Along the way, get to know the characters as they learn about themselves and experience the harrowing adventures along the way. A classic formula well developed and throughly presented to enjoy!"
1,Unbelievably Regretful,The cover-page looks nice. That's the only thing good about this book. Pages filled with aspects copied from Tolkien and complete BOREDOM. It probably starts good but then you think what you could have done with the money instead. The first page was filled with people claiming that it is the best in its genre (were they drunk or high?)
5,A must read for Fantasy enthusists,"Beware! Once you start reading this book, you'll never be able to put it down. You'll find yourself inwrapped in a world vividly described and unlike any other. This is a must on any Fantasy reader's list"
3,"Good Reading, Not Brlliant. Nowhere near tolkien","I have so far read seven of the eight wheel of time books, and that alone shows that it's a very readable and enjoyable fantasy series. And yet, all the comparisions between master fantasy writers and Jordan do not fall in Jordan's side. Although his combat scenes are superb, and he can write good complicated plots, I was DISGUSTED by his handling of men and women, in an awkward attempt to be funny, men and women never understand each other, all women are manipulating, coy, and breast revealing. While the men are lost boys(in the eyes of the women) who need direction in every step. Get Real!!! All of his characters act exactly alike, it's like one character with multiple personality jumping around in the world and doing lots of thingsRead it if you don't have anything better to read."
2,The Eye of the World : Book One of 'The Wheel of Time',"I purchased the Audio Book version and was generaly dissatisfied. The reading was kind of machine like and combined with the simple way the book was written made it seem to much like ""See Dick. See Dick run. See Jane"" or ""Blam*ZOWIE*SMASH!"" Etc."
1,Horrible...,"I made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing the first 4 books all at one time, based on the strength of the reviews on Amazon. Mistake! I found that I really didn't like the author's writing style, and the plot is very predictable and geared towards very young readers. Not what I expected, and a very disappointing read. Did my best to stick it out, thinking that it HAD to improve, but bailed about 2/3 of the way though the second book. Torture..."
1,Punishingly Bad...Simply Awful,"This book is an excruciatingly unending parade of rambling pointless writing describing the most cliched scenes, characters, and events imaginable. Other one star reviews have excellently described in more detail the whys and hows of this miserable book. I felt obliged to add another one star review in the hopes of sparing some poor reader wasting their good money and precious time on this monumental piece of drivel."
1,worthless bore,I read this because I had heard good things about it but it is one of the worst novels I have ever read. It is full of boring characters an uncompelling storyline and witless turgid prose.Totally inept on all levels!
2,A rambling book with no apparent point,"After 100 or so pages, I gave up on this book.The characters are shallow and predictable. The world they exist in is dull and shallow. Need we say more? Very sophomoric."
1,don't believe the hype,"I'm only going to say one thing""he said loquaiously""talk about filled with swifties adverbs and speaker attributions read it to laugh at the michaniswhat a hack!!!!!!!"
3,Mediocre,"I wish I could have given this a better review I really do. It all started so well very exciting, full of drama and suspense. And then it went downhill oh boy did it go downhill. Long endless scenes of travel and not a whole lot else does not exactly make for excitement. And then it went from bad to worse. In all the years of reading, all the books I have read I have NEVER been so happy to put one down and say I am finished with it. The book could have used an editor to trim a heck of a lot of unnecessary detail. I kept thinking it's got to get better but sadly it never did. Overall very disappointed"
5,Once Upon the Wheel of Time,"There have always been stories. For as long as there was communication, no matter how primitive, there were stories. Fantasies and dreams more often than fact, but they were there. Somehow, it seems to me, that Robert Jordan has come across a wonderful way to tell us his dreams. He has given us characters to root for and scorn, to love and despise. The plot line itself has been centered around the Wheel of Time, not just Rand al'Thor and his friends, Mat and Perrin.As a student and avid reader, the way Jordan captured me with the promise of adventure was genius. I am ordinary, just the average person, yet... As with Rand, Mat, and Perrin, ANYONE can be ta'veren. Anyone can be special.I give this book, the first in a series of amazing adventures, five stars. This is not only for being well-written and a masterpiece to rival that of Tolkien's prestige, but as being a way to show that adventure lies anywhere, you just have to find it."
5,Finally!,"I have been waiting for years for an e-book of ""The Wheel of Time"" series and I'm pleased to say that the result is not disappointing. There's no need to review the book because others have done it well and their reviews and comments are abundant across the internet. My purpose for writing is to let long time fans know that the e-book version is complete and unabridged. It even features the chapter icons and an interactive table of contents. It is a steal at the price! Now I can have one of my favorite series off the bookshelves (Yeah, at twelve books long and counting I cannot get all of them on the same shelf!) and onto my computer/Kindle where I can enjoy them everywhere without regard to space.Thank you, Tor!"
4,wheel of time - just epic!!,Absolutely amazing to hear the book on disc. At first it was strange i'll admit because of the pronounciation of names and places - some were different to how i read them - but once over that it opened up a whole new world to this incredible series.
5,Great Introduction to a Phenomenal Series,When I came upon Jordan's first book I was looking for a fantasy series that would keep my attention past the first chapter. This one was a definite success. With the passing of every page the characters become more and more alive. I recommend this series to anyone seeking to lose themselves for several months.
1,Macmillan/TOR price increase,"Macmillan has increased the price for this ebook, so they are now charging more for the zero per-unit-cost ebook than the paperback. In this pricing dispute with Amazon, Macmillan has claimed that the concern was about newly released books. This book has been in print for nearly two decades. Any costs associated with producing this book we recouped a thousand fold before anyone ever thought of selling the ebook. Given that the cost to Macmillan of the ebook is essentially zero, Macmillan is now charging an unreasonable price for this ebook.The bottom line is, I purchased this a few weeks ago for six or seven dollars, it is now 50% more expensive."
1,A weak plot and average writing does not a book make,"If you like a book with a mix of stolen plots (mostly Tolkien) written in such a way as to allow for as many $sequals$ as possible this is for you. Here and there his writing is okay, but mostly it is bland. This reminds me of a soap opera. Lots of people like it, but I can't seem to stand it. I read it only because a friend from my army days loved it. Even my flat mate who loves trash fiction gave up. Read some Terry Pratchett instead and spare yourself."
3,"Good, but ...","Been there done that. If this book is an homage to Lord of the Rings. It does a good job. If not, it's awfully derivative. Many characters from Middle Earth make an appearance under a new name -- Ents, Trolls, Orcs, Sauron, Gandalf, Ringwraiths ... they're all in there. The rest of the series gets better, although it draws heavily from the Dune series -- Aes Sedai? Bene Gesserit. Aiel? Fremen. Rand Al'Thor? Paul Muad'dib. Don't get me wrong, I got the first two for Christmas and bought the rest. They're a fun read. But don't look for anything you haven't seen before ..."
4,"Good, not greatest",I enjoyed the eye of the world and found it to be entertaining and some good twists/ surprises. I don't think it is extremely original though. It pulled a lot from Lord of the Rings for me - much more than any other widely applauded author.
5,almost netter than tolkien,"I discoverd this series not all that long ago and what a pleasant suprise it has been. I have only just finished this first book, and although i have heard from many how tedious the series becomes by book six or sevn this one made me estatic. Jordan is a master at character development and more importantly plot development. The book started slow but never truly bored me. im very intriuged to start the second installment now."
3,A good beginning,I'd more likely give this book 3 1/2 stars. It's a good start to what is obviously a HUGE series. Those of you intimidated by the size of a book should probably find somthing else a little easier to read instead. Good beginning character and plot developement. Plenty of things happening without too much time in between (more often than not). This book sets a solid foundation for what has the potential to be a wonderful series.
4,The Wheel of Time.....priceless!,"This first book (hopefully of many more)is of course a definitive one. The characters are laid out in detail, and the detail grows as the story grows! The only complaint is that this novel is a bit of a roller coaster, but then; aren't all. Through the slow parts, the book can easily be put down, but when the action picks up, time seems to stand still. Robert Jordan has created one of the finest works of art in this series, and I hope that all following part one will be the same. I quickly became accustomed to the heroes and villians, making this rate up there next to Dragonlance."
3,I was somewhat let down.,"OK is the only way I can describe this book. The book is well written. The characters are well developed and unique which I like. Robert Jordan has created some unique settings also. But the book is fairly slow to start and the ""climax,"" if it can be called that, is a total let down. At the end of the book I felt like, ""I read through all these pages for THAT?"" Again the book is entertaining and I do plan to read the next book in the series, but don't believe all the hype that the Wheel of Time series is one of the best written...so far some of the reviews I've read are quite exaggerated."
4,"Among the best, but be warned...","This is among the best fantasy books ever written, and the first 5 books just keep getting better. Then, after that, the books get longer and slower paced, though still very good. The problem with this series is not that it ever gets bad, but just that it takes too long to read. Do read this book, but only if you are willing to still be reading the same story several years from now...it is going to be most likely 12 rather long books in length. Make sure you are willing to make the investment of time before you make yourself a slave to Robert Jordan and his long winded pen."
3,A bit obvious,"As the title says, I found it a bit obvious in places. The characters are pretty standard fantasy fodder. The story telling was enjoyable enough. Would I recommend it? Maybe if the person ticked me off!!! However now that I've started I guess I will see it through."
4,Slow start,It's a slow start I thought it got very interesting after about 400 pages. I am very eager to start the next book in this series. If you enjoy fantasy novels and magic I would recommend this book.
4,good book,great book compared to most of the trash written today---not as good as Tolkien--series gets better though
5,One of the best fantasy books I've ever read.,"I love all of Jordan's books because you get ""sucked into"" the character's world. His books are like taking one huge history lesson. Jordan literally made a world and let's his readers visit it."
1,a whiter shade of pale,"O, the Shame: 782 pages I will never get back (800, including the glossary). Read Tolkien, Martin, Rothfuss. Then reread them. Do this instead of wasting your time on Jordan, whose work pales in comparison. Highly derivative of Tolkien, but about a hundredth as well written or interesting. Never makes you laugh, like Martin does every time you encounter Tyrion Lannister. Gives you almost no real sense of character, as does Rothfuss with his protagonist, Kvothe. Overall, just really dull, flat, and lifeless. I slogged through this first book of the series but will never crack open the 2nd or 3rd I unfortunately bought as part of a box set. One last thing - they say, ""Never judge a book by its cover."" But, in this case, the extremely cheesy cover (of the mass market paperback edition) really should have made me stay away."
2,Soap opera with weak female characters,"Jordan seemed to think that one makes a strong female character by giving her magical powers rather than making her a strong person.Unfortunately, all his female characters behave like spoiled children playing at being grown ups. This might be tolerable if, through the series, these characters matured. But they don't. In fact, all his female characters are the same petulant 4 year old wearing a different dress and hair colour.Amid world shattering events, all they can talk about is who's going to kiss whom and who gets to boss whom around. The discussions about bossing around go on interminably regardless of whether it's a conflict between two women or between men and women.I'm not sure Jordan ever actually met a strong woman.The ""who's the biggest hen in the hen house"" fiasco never stops and gets extremely tiresome, detracting from the story constantly."
2,"Oh, for Pete's Sake!","These books started out quite promising, but have gone on so long, with new major (and totally pointless minor) characters popping up so often along the way that it has devolved into fantasy soap opera. Only buy these books if you're into endless serials in which nothing is ever resolved. Give me strength..."
3,Good book,"Enjoyed the story , the characters the maturing of rand with different place he traveled and the constant danger the group was in"
3,Dark library cover print,"I mostly bought this out of curiosity of the product, and the product I received was much what I wanted but the cover was very dark and not printed very well."
2,This book didn't work for me,"Pacing was too slow and I really disliked the emasculated men and angry women. However, I did plod through it the first time around but couldn't do it the second time around as I tried to figure out why so many people lked it.My favorite author is George R.R. Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series.I will add that RJ helped rejuvenate the fantasy genre in the early 90s in this first book.However, for the reasons stated above, as well as just not liking any of the characters or feeling enough emotional resonance . . . RJ cut in to the pacing too much by going off into Historical tangents too often . . . I can't give this a very high score."
2,Good start to a bad series.,"I hate to say this because the author has passed away, but picking up this book will be the begnining of years of pain. This book and the few that follow it are very good, they get you hooked. Then the series slows to a crawl and it becomes a chore to finish because you've become interested in the characters and the story. Jordan begins to write like a college student trying to fill space on a page of a term paper. Sadly, he passed before finishing and I've just learned that the author chosen to finish the ""last"" book is going to stretch it out into three. This is after the first writer stretched a decent 5 books into a torturous 11. I will not continue, I advise you not to start."
4,"Enter an incredible world, get stuck reading 1000's of pages","I have read 7 of the 8 books in Wheel of Time and have thoroughly enjoyed the world created by Robert Jordan. A world without electricity and pollution, a world where good and evil are at war. This first book introduces interesting characters who are confronted with important problems to solve. Much of the book covers their unending journey to battle the Dark One. My complaint is that the wonderful complications are not brought to a satisfying conclusion. With each book, I think ""Boy, this will be great when all these interesting characters resolve all the problems they face"". Unfortunately, the reader is teased and left hanging wondering what will happen, and so on to the next book. I wanted to a nice climax to the action. I keep hoping, book after book, that some conclusions will be reached. Why not conclude the story already and have the next book start a new story?"
3,"Not a bad read, but nowhere near the best.","The Eye of the World is a little hard to get into, which is ok as there's well over 600 pages in all for the reader to settle in. The book seems to borrow quite a bit of plot from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, although in my opinion Jordan is not quite as good an author. There are times when the book definately seems to drag along and the ending is a bit dissapointing. I'm not sure if I'll read the others in the series yet or not."
3,"Very Good, The second time through","Very engaging, start to the wheel of time series. Robert Jordan is excellent, the second time you read it. The first time that i read the novel, i was confused by some things, and wondered how he blatantly managed to plaigerize other fiction works (Perrins Sending - from Elfquest) However the later books depart this mold, and after reading some of the other books the first makes more sense."
1,It will never end...,"I case you don't know much about this series, know this: there are already 10 installments, and more to come. And just take a look at the size of each volume!Before you pick up this book, look up the reviews of those poor souls who have read the last installment - notice the weariness? Most are bored and upset, and even those who kind-of-liked-it are really tired of it. Because the truth is, this series will never end.And the pity is that this could have been a very good series. ""The Eye of the World"" starts out as an excellent book, with rich descriptions and 3-D characters. But, around mid-point you start to have this nagging feeling that things are not progressing as they should, that events are moving way too slowly, and it just gets worse and worse.So: you have been warned. I was able to break the spell and abandon the series afte this first volume; there are many who have not been so lucky..."
1,Formatting on Kindle is a real shame,"I love this book series and I was looking forward to starting over on the Kindle, after a long hiatus. Unfortunately, the formatting and general appearance of this first book is really, REALLY sub-par. From what Tor has said, they provide the file in ePub format and Amazon does the conversion to their format, themselves. It is amazing to me that there is apparently no quality control process at Amazon for this, because I don't know how else you would explain the first letter of every chapter being converted into standard text and placed a line above the first sentence of each chapter.I wish I could give this the five star review the book deserves, but Amazon really needs to get the message here...we care about whether the Kindle version is an accurate reproduction of the print version, Amazon!"
2,Ponderous and slow,"The series starts with a bang, but deserves to have died an honorable death at the end of volume 3, at which point it becomes very clear that rather than bringing things to a logical conclusion, the author decided to milk as much money from his readers as possible. Whole volumes have now been written in which the plot does not advance one step. I quit reading about two-thirds of the way through volume 5 and any reader with half a brain or with something better to do (like watch the grass grow) has done likewise. Perhaps the most over-rated series in the genre. Doesn't hold a candle to J. R. R. Tolkien"
2,big disappointment,this book was very disappointing. I bought it after a lot of people said it was one of their favorites. I found it boring and too long. It might have been better if it was maybe half as long. I read 13 other books while reading it because it was so long and boring. I was going to rate it a one star but I think the charater Loial deserves a star of his own. He was about the only thing from the book that I liked.
3,Good yarn.,"Jordan spins a good tale, if not a bit wordy. I like wordy, sometimes. Simple text. You will find you may never need a dictionary. A good time-killer, but not to thought provoking. Sort of _Dune_ in fantasy. In short, good reading for a fantasy tale"
1,Snooze central,"I have no idea how this sereies became popular, i'm still puzzled over how it got published. This book attempts to be Tolkien or BeoWulf, and fails horribly. Invisible plot, paper thin 'characters', and a thorough inablity ro describe anything in a consise manner."
3,Long-winded but a great series,"Firstly, i just want to say that these books are good-but be prepared for huge lulls in action as the series goes on. By the time you arrive at book 9 (i've almost finished it!!!) you are almost praying for something-anything at all to happen. All of the different characters end up blending together and i've come to the point where, when i see a name, i have to stop and think: who is that again? The same thing happens with the various groups of characters which are wandering around. On the other hand Robert Jordan juggles the plots and characters perfectly and I have to give credit for the sheer imagination behind these books.This is a truly great epic but it puts lord of the rings to shame with its long-windedness. It is worth the read if you have the time, patience and a comfy chair"
1,all this praise is overblown,"I am a great fan of fantasy and sci-fi, but this is one of the few books I couldn't bring myself to finish. I believe I would have enjoyed it had I read it at the age of fifteen or less. However at the age of twenty all I can say is: boring. Characters lack development, names of beings are just puns of other more known names (The main bad guy is Shai'tan - Satan). There must be at least a dozen authors who can and has developed the ""innocent youngsters chased by bad guys"" plot better. It is basically this: be chased, fight Trollocks (Orcs), encounter new characters (and then forget them), be chased some more. I am honestly puzzled at the five stars-reviews. Especially if you are a Tolkien fan: keep away from this book. I would swap the entire series for one Terry Goodkind book."
4,Great book,"Modern day Tolkienistic style. Jordan delivers fantasy on an unprecedented scale.This book is a beautiful fast paced epic packed with social commentaries of every kind. If you start the series now, prepare to be hooked forever. There are currently 8 1000 page books in the series!"
3,"Decent story, but not enough to grab me for this long of a series","I won't be verbose here. The book was good; by itself it was probably a 3.5. I enjoyed it even if it felt a little too cliched. The world is fully realized and the writing was good even if a little long-winded at times. This book is definitely worth checking out if you are a fantasy fan, however, just realize how long this series is. If this book isn't a 4.5-5 to you off the bat, it might be worth cutting your losses early rather than getting invested in such a long series. For me, each of the next two books was slightly less engrossing than this and I gave up at that point."
4,Take it from me. I'm no fanboy...,"If you like fantasy or epic tales or stories set in detailed worlds--this is the first in a series of novels for you. If you like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars or Star Trek then there is a chance you'll like this book.The author's writting style is good, but not as renown as some of these reviewers would have you think. Sometimes things can seem cliche or trite. The pace of the book is great until the end. The ending is poor. Fortunately it is only a small part of a larget series.I like epic tales, some fantasy novels and stories set in detailed worlds. Hence, 4 stars. I've not quite finished the 2nd in the series."
3,Way too long...,"This book drags more than any other I've seen. In the time it took for me to read 400 pages of Eye of the World, I managed to read the first six books in the Sword of Truth (actually, that one really slows down after a while too).Maybe if they made cliff notes for this book to cut out all the mindless fluff, I'd take it, but its a little exessive for me.Despite how needlessly long it is, I still manage to pcik it back up every now and then before becoming, once again, hopelessly bored.You must be very adamant or very...very...very bored to work your way through this book. Otherwise, its too much."
3,Where's your editor?,"This starts as a nice tight story. It has a lot going for it. But I get the feeling that the author has gotten the opinion of Himself that He is to good to be edited. Let me at it with a big eraser and a magic marker!!!!!Is there nobody at TOR with a backbone? Face up to this man with EL MARKO drawn and cut the soap opera stuff out (How many ways can I describe a flinty-eyed look) and let the story take over, let the characters actually DO something. I have been in plays like this, when the director worships Shaw, you're in trouble. This is MY windy way of saying= Good Story but Too Many Words. Read it with a pen in hand. You will need to keep a character list going, who they are, which side they are on etc. They will show up a few books later. Every one of these books is at least twice as long as it needs to be."
2,Save yourself while you can...,"The esteemed reviewer that wrote the review titled ""Danger, Danger, Danger"" has summed it up very well. The first few books are very good... then not so much. Add to that the fact that there are 11 (yes, 11) of these tomes released to date, and the story line is still in a complex shambles with little sign of ending, and you have a sad continuation of a series that started with excellent potential.And another thing (pet peeve time) what is up with the cover art on these books?!? Could they possibly have picked worse artwork? It's horrible... HORRIBLE...Anyway, I gave this book 2 stars, +4 for the first few books, -2 for the rest. Start this series knowing that the first 4 or so books are very good, then you should move on and read Wiki for the plot summaries on the rest. You'll save yourself weeks of wasted time to read more worthy books."
4,"Detailed fantasy world, sometimes under-realized","Jordon's ""Eye of the World"" is a detailed fantasy adventure. He creates a detailed world and history of his lands. Unlike most traditional books in the fantasy land, the actually quest isn't known until nearly the end of the book. A flaw of this book, is that after all of this massive detail, things are wrapped up very quickly and with not a lot of flash. Jordon does have a tendency for too much detail and repetition. A more satisfying ending could have been fleshed out if some of the rest of the book had been edited a bit. I have found Terry Brook's Shannara series better written: Detailed but not overwhelming, paced quicker with better resolutions. I will continue with Jordon's series and see how it goes. With 10+ books and legions of fans, it may be an excellent series."
4,A great start to a fantastic series!,"Although the first two-hundred pages are a little slow, once the action gets started it never relents! Here begins Rand al'Thor's struggle against the Dark One, a struggle that will take him from humble beginnings to become one of the most powerful men in the world. The characterization is so strong one cannot help but become enamored of Jordan's cast. Any fan of Tolkien's brand of epic fantasy should not be without this book. Start here, and you will be compelled to follow this series to its conclusion. The only flaw is that the series begins to drag around book 7, and Jordan seems unable to bring it to a timely and satisfying ending. This book, however, stands on its own as a fantasy classic."
3,Not the Best Beginning,"Now I am on the 3rd book of The Wheel of Time and it is excellant; as was the 2nd! The first book, The Eye of the World, was good but it was an 800 page read that came to the outcome of barely anything. Rand doesn't believe or know he is the Dragon and doesn't consciously know he is using the One Power until the end. Once he does though (which is the 2nd book and on) is very exciting.What I liked and didn't like:-the story could of been shortened by about 200 pages (though some vital things would be missing)-too many inns-useless talk and info+lovable characters+Great Storyline+beginning of an excellant series!I believe once I get farther into The Wheel of Time series I will look back on this book and very well love it! Very possible. So don't take my comments to harshly, I think whoever is thinking about reading this book should. You would be missing out on the rest if you didn't. Besides, reading one book is a small price to pay for an amazing series! ENJOY!"
4,Not bad at all!,"I expected this book to be horendous,for I heard that Jordan is like Eddings.I HATE Eddings.But luckily,I found that this was not true .Jordan is much more interesting and exciting than Eddings ,and also has much more magic.He also has more detail on the plot ,not on politics .Jordan creates an amazing and creative story .Here is the plot :Rand al'Thor lives in Emond's Field ,and life is terribly dull for him .But his life changes when Moiraine ,a woman who claims to be an Aes Sedai (wielder of the One Power )comes to Emond's Field .Soon after ,the wicked Trollocs,half man half beast attack his village .Rand and his friends are forced to embark on a quest with Moiraine and her Warder ,Lan ,a quest in which Rand will learn his true destiny."
4,One of my favorite books,"Short and simple: This is a good book in a good seriesWhy?Robert Jordan succeeds in establishing an extensive base for all of the characters' personalities. (My personal favorite characters are Perrin Aybara and Nynaeve Al'Meara) With a decent plot behind the story Jordan manages to quirk the reader's attention with new information and other surprising events and characters. True, this is a lllooonnnggg series but it is a good read one time through. The way I see it is, if a book can make me laugh until my sides hurt, want to burn it at that moment, and even want to strangle some of the character's throats at times, then this is a good book and series to read.I would drone on more, but then I might spoil the fun. Enjoy..."
3,not as good as expected,"all I have to say is that people have to stop saying that it has the same components as tolkien, there is no way around that he started fantasy. Everything is based on his books, so stop saying its alot like Tolkien. I personally didnt see why it was so hyped to be the best sence Tolkien, It wasnt that great."
2,"Done before, and better...","What's to be said? Jordan is overrated. Go read Tolkien, Leiber or the Dying Earth novels of Jack Vance. Don't waste time, or money. It's all been done before..."
2,BORRRRRRRRRRR-RING!,"My friends gave this one rave reviews so i thought heck i'll give it a try. The book starts out interesting, but it quickly gets boring. The book drones on for 800 some pages. Its like listening to Janet Reno speak for hours on end. I guess its ok, but give me Terry Goodkind any day. Hes the better writer of the two. And you can bet i aint buying the sequel!"
4,from the blight to the seas an all around good trip,"From the small town of Edmond's field to the city streets of Caemlyn Jordan's book has a beating heart of its own that you feel pulsating as you read it. You feel the famine of the many hungry folk, The fear of the source. Its an adventure awaiting to unfold. Zogothrak approves!"
5,draws you in and doesn't let go,"I have to say like all the other thousands of people out there that i love this series. The detail really makes you envision the world and everything is so clear that it is as if you are not reading it but living it. Jordan has a great plot line and a new take on power and the like. I recommend that you read New Spring from the book Legends 3 so that you can an insight into some of the characters past before you start The Eye of the World. The book is a real keeper even though it may be a little hard in the beginning, stick with it you will have discovered a real gem."
2,Don't read this series,If you are looking to read a well written fantasy series then stay away from anything with Robert Jordan's name on it. I won't dwell on what everyone else already agrees on. Even most of the loyal Jordan fans have to admit that the last five books of the series were subpar to the earlier volumes. NOTHING HAPPENS. Over half of the books are filled with boring descriptions and stock phrases (not to mention stock characters). RJ doesn't understand that you might not want a highly detailed description of every thread of a woman's dress every single time you encounter her. He doesn't need to constantly remind you that certain characters have mannerisms. There is no point in reading something that starts out good if you know that it ends up crap. RJ is a hack. Don't waste your time with him. Read George RR Martin if you want to see what good fantasy is.
3,"Not the best, but certainly worth reading.","A fantasy epic based in a fully realized world, it has at times been compared to J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Ring"" saga. Though he has also been accused of taking too much from Tolkien's work for his own purposes, it still seems clear that Robert Jordan is working out a master plan of his own design (no matter what he is borrowing from). At times it seems as if the reader is looking into a fantasy soap opera. It is easy to become quickly wrapped up in the story with his descriptive writing style. The reader will find themselves wanting more at the end of the book, keeping them in suspense until the next book comes out."
1,Pathetic,"""This title is not available for customers from your location in:Europe (change region)Shop titles available for Europe""Pathetic. I guess it's the publisher's fault."
4,The first three are good...,"I enjoyed the first book, even though it gets very boring in the middle of the book. The ending was great however. So I went out to buy the second book. It was good, if a little confusing, as in charaters the seem to be plotting at the beging then don't turn up for the rest of the book. I even enjoyed the third book mainly because Perin's in it so much and is pretty much left out of the next two books after no.4. After that it was just one huge book after the other with mindless things that I decided to waste my money on something else. If you want to waste time and money on a go nowhere book series go ahead. I'm done until the final book is realease. Don't belive me, old WOT no.6 sit on my shelf unread to this day."
4,"Good the first, even better the second","I have been a WoT fan for quite some time now. This book is definitely not the best of Jordan's work, but it is good. To appreciate the book, remember that this is a long term plotline, that has still not concluded after the 10th book. It is a very good starting point though, and shows a glimpse of the world that unfolds throughout the rest of the series. Don't skip this book if you plan on reading the rest of the series, else it is akin to learning History starting after 1800. I certainly do reccommend this book to Fantasy fans. There is a lot of detail to wade through, but heh, that could make the story for you!And don't worry if you're not thrilled with the writing style. Jordan only starts setting a rhythm (sp?) here. His next couple of books sets the mood and tone for his writings, which I find I like even better. Give it a try, I did and didn't regret it."
3,the best of an overrated series,"By now any and all fans of fantasy writing know of, and have probably read some of, Robert Jordan's 'The Wheel of Time' series. For those who have not, let me say this: this is possibly the most overrated work of modern fantasy that I have ever read. This first book is the best of the bunch, which speaks *volumes* about the quality of the rest of the series. If you are not willing to leap into an ""epic"" that will span 10,000 pages (with about 750 pages of actual story), stay away...stay far, far away."
2,I was disappointed,"Jordan's language does not evoke the grandeur of Tolkein. I read 150 pages of this book and found several patches of poor writing. I gave up when I read the word ""nervous-making."""
4,"Great book, but not SO great","This book starts the popular Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, but it isn't so good as some of the later books in the series. In this book, Rand is the only character we get to know better. Mat, Perrin and others stay distant. Even so, the story is pretty good and intereresting."
2,Not what I hoped for,"After hearing all those things about Jordan, I finally tried the first book. And I'm disappointed. I can't understand why he should be so good; I thought the book far too long, even boring. There are other authors much better than Jordan, with deeper charakters, more action and better humor. Sorry, but Jordan is by far not as good as expected."
4,Good vs. evil in a fantasy world that seems real.,"It is as if Robert Jordan has really been to this fantasy world he has created, and has learned its geography, history, and peoples. His depcitions are so believable and real. His characters are every day people who would rather be normal and be left alone than be dragged off in to an adventure where the future of the whole world hangs in the balance, thus, making them even more real-seeming. They don't want to be heroes, but they become so in spite of themselves. The magic, myths, monsters and legends are refreshingly creative and new. I am sticking with this series."
4,Kindle Version Lacking,"I won't use this space to review the The Eye of the World itself, but rather to report my disappointment in the Kindle version of this book. Originally, the publishers cited delays in eBook release because they wanted to include all of the relevant maps, drop caps, and chapter icons. Unfortunately, it seems that they decided to forgo all but the chapter icons, though this could be the fault of the device I'm attempting to read it on. (Kindle iPhone app.) Regardless of the device, the eBook text is riddled with a surprising number of what appear to be optical character recognition errors: misspelled words, missing punctuation, etc. It really comes off as a fairly sloppy conversion."
5,One of the best novels of all time!,"As anyone can see from the multiple raves entered here, Jordan's Wheel of Time series is one of the best things to happen in the fantasy genre (or in fiction in general) in a long time. The books are engrossing and fascinating, and if you can stop reading when it's bedtime, then you have much more self-discipline than I do. These books also trigger wonderful dreams when you're asleep!"
2,HUH?,"The Wheel of Time spins on and on, but the characters can't seem to keep on. This book is just, how do I say it so, so, so stupid. Here is why:THE BADFirst off, the women are unrealistically dumb, idiotic, vicious and cliched. All the ones on the good side are slender, beautiful, unintelligent model-types, while the ones on the bad side are ugly, old, and tomboy-ish. Second is this major dump in the plotline: after escaping a roup of disciplined golin/troll things (armed with catchpoles) the escaalade across a river and get lost (LOTR cliche as big as Asia) and promptly spend 300 pages in the dumb forest before suddenly finding each other again, ""spectacularly"", and then getting lost again.THE GOODThe first 150 pages."
2,Try and grab the unabridged version...,"Ok, ok, ok, before you bash this review saying to yourself, ""How could he give ROBERT JORDAN only two stars...?"" Well, the answer isn't in his story but the fact that the audio book itself is abridged and the reader is flat. Mark Rolston was GREAT in Aliens (the second one) but he wasn't really made for doing readings. Aside from that, listening to the abridged version of this story leaves so much detail out that Robert Jordan is known for. So, what I say is already listed in the title of this review... grab yourself a copy of the unabridged version. And if you're a true fan, you'll find it on CD!"
2,"Good Book, Lousy Abridgment","I have a long commute and have listened to many audio books. All told, these are the worst abridgments I've ever heard. It's really a shame as this book series is quite enjoyable. I somehow doubt Robert Jordon had a chance to review this abridgment before it was released. Listening to this is like reading the book and skipping every other 25 pages regardless of the story line and transitions."
4,"I liked it, but...","I was told by many random people on the net that this series was a good read, so I picked it up. I enjoyed it a lot and found it better than Tolkien. (To be honest, Tolkien's The Hobbit was enough to keep me away from the rest.) The only problem I have with Jordan is over-descriptiveness. Eye of the World was great, but some of his latter books, in my opinion, seem to rattle on and on about the same things, even expanding into further books. But overall, if you like fantasy and authors like Raymond Feist and David Eddings, you should love this book."
2,Wheel Of Time,"Jordan had the start of what could have been an amazing series... unfortunately, he refuses to end it, and is really just milking the cash cow now, on his 9th book. Ironically, the Wheel Of Time Series is much like the Wheel Of Time In The Book, repetitive and never-ending."
2,Has Tolkien's Estate sued this guy yet?,"There was not an original character in this book. The languages looked like goobley-gook, and the plot was taken straight from the Lord of the Rings with some Arthurian Legend mixed in. Even the names were similiar! Don't waste your time and Read GRR Martin instead."
2,"How many inns can an author describe, anyway?","This book is boring. One reviewer commented that it's all about a bunch of characters ""trying to get from Point A to Point B"", and that's pretty much it. A group of people go to a town, fight with evil people, flee to the next town, fight with more evil people, ad nauseam. My fiance' made me read this book, promising that ""it gets better from here."" He's right--you have to read _Eye_ in order to get to book 2, _The Great Hunt_, which is where the series starts getting good. Trouble is, it gets bad again after about book 5, _The Fires of Heaven_--the last truly good installment of the series--so I don't know whether to recommend this book or not.Here goes: I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a boring prelude to a series that is really good for a while but peters out into insipitude. Expect frustration..."
2,How did this book get so many good reviews???,"I've read a lot of fantasy novels in my 36 years on Earth and maybe the reason I could not ""appreciate"" this novel is because the standard fantasy formula has become so repetative and sleep inducing. This book is too long winded (like so many other bloated examples of this genre) and, as a result, BORING!!. I had the same problem with Tad Williams's ""The Dragonbone Chair"". YAWN!! I stopped three quarters of the way through EOTW and started reading ""The Anvil of Ice"" by Michael Scott Rohan, a much better fantasy (get it thru amazon.co.uk).In closing, life's too short...read books that are intelligently written. Leave the fat, dull revenue raisers on the store shelf."
2,borefest,"I am so gonna get a flack for this,but really, this is a BOREFEST.I have read 500+ books that can make hook me into its end, but this? This is just....boring.Probably it's just Jordan's writing: it sometimes too plain, and the tempo and sequences are not inviting.The imaginations are good, the concepts are mindtickling, but the executions are sometimes lacking, the characterizations are sometimes plain, and could be downright annoying (the wisdom, for example).This is the first book that is promoted as great work of fantasy but bores me tremendously.I probably have read too many modern, more bombastic (but nicely written) books than this one."
2,Not what people make it out to be.,"I don't think this book is very good. I think Robert Jordan draws things out way too long, and his character development is weak. I read the first 600 pages of this book waiting for it to become original and exciting and it never happened. There is not much to distinguish Robert Jordan's series from typical fantasy works. These are not works of genius (meriting 4-5 stars). They are simply entertainment. What pains me the most is that Robert Jordan can be eloquent at times... why can't he escape the ""pure entertainment"" bug? Also, half of the book, even down to the names, is plagiarized.Don't waste your time. I'm on a quest to get rid of mindless entertainment."
1,Don't do it!,"Reading the Wheel of Time series is like getting hooked on drugs - exciting at first but then aggravating and desperate as you go on.After about book 4, the series begins to slow down considerably. Even more detail is given and eventually there is so many things to consider and remember you begin to forget.Like other Jordan readers, I will snap up the new books as soon as it reaches the stores... but I wish he'd been a LOT more succinct."
1,Why in Hell would you pay the same price as a paperback book?,"Have I missed something? I do not understand why you would pay the same price as a paperback book? I thought the whole purpose of this endeavor was to save paper and reduce costs for the publisher as well as the consumer? Obviously people are buying them at this cost, shame on you consumers for buying into this rip off.I have read the whole series except for the last two books. My intention was to buy a kindle and then buy the whole series again and start from the beginning. NOT, I will just go buy the paperback series.What a complete disappointment. I would rate it a zero!!! but the system doesn't let me"
1,The Definition of Filth,"What a god-awful waste of time (WoT.)This book has been going on for over a decade (read: century.) In Steven King's The Dark Tower, he accomplishes everything Jordan does in half the time, none of the boring repetition, and quite a bit more style.Also, its the greatest rip-off of all time. Think ""In a hole in the ground lived a hobbit.""Aes Sedai-wizards (istari.)Hobbits-two rivers folk.Aragorn-Lan.Moirane-Gandalf.Sauron-Dark One.The ring-SealsChrist! Can't you see how bad this charlatan is ripping you off?! This story is completely uninventive, as is the setting. Normally, I'd just ignore it, but its so disgusting that some people are pouring their hearts out about this trash.""Better than Shakespeare!""Don't read this, the Sword of Truth series, Shannara, Xanth, or Raymond Feist."
5,Wonderful start to a series,"I got hooked on this series years ago, and it only took this first one to earn my dedication. Robert Jordan has a great ability to create wonderful, believable fantasy characters, and then to let them each develop personally as a human being and develop unique fantasy characteristics. All I can say is that, like so many before and after me, this book captivated my interest and set up some great characters, and in the books to come, the new characters to arrive are all at least as cleverly developed... and let me just say that, if you are a fantasy-lover newcome to Jordan, you will UNDOUBTEDLY enjoy this and the next 2-3 books.If you like fantasy, you will not regret buying this book... though some day you may regret becoming hooked on this seemingly infinite series. Though this is part of an apparently infinite series, this first volume of the million-ogy is most certainly worth your money."
5,The Eye of the World is the Highlight of My World...,"This book is the best book I have ever read! It's detailed plot, settings, and characters are amazing, fascinating, and fun to enjoy! Robert Jordan reveals mysteries to you before you know they exist. Before I was even done with this book, I bought the second one. The Eye of the World is a 'must read'!"
3,"Starts good, fades fast","When I inititally read this book I thought it was great despite the unoriginality of the plot but after I waded through to the third book and realized there was no end in sight I gave up. To me, this series is a great example of how commercialism has ruined fantasy. Maybe, at one point, Robert Jordan was going to write 3 or 4 books, but once he got a bestseller he decided to milk it for all it was worth, and he has been doing it for the past 13 years. These books are so padded and bloated it is hard to know where to start. Unless you have an amazing amount of time to invest and don't mind skipping every other chapter I wouldn't bother with this series."
4,WoT The books of wonder and length,"I must admit that it took me several tries to finish this book.. There is a very long and I mean long character building chapter er chapters that is.. But, once you settle in and say I am going to tackle this beast it is worth it.. there is tons and tons of information and subplots loaded into this one book.. And then just as you are nabbed.. it ends.. Ohh well guess you gotta be caught for the next book no?Overall the whole series is well written and worth the read if you like epic adventures.. On the other hand if you are looking for characters that leap off the pages and join your life.. You may want to look at some other authors.. For although the characters are well written that is all they are characters in an ongoing adventure."
4,Halfway through and addictive,"Well, what I think of this book is amazing. It's for the older-than-Tolkien-older-than-J.K. Rowling crowd, most definitely. And it's also a great book for people who wish to switch over from strictly SF to fantasy or strictly nonfiction to fiction.I like how they stick an ordinary man, Rand al'Thor, into the midst of the extraordinary. Although this is a long book, it is SO worth reading, especially since you can trace parallels b/t this and the real world, and also b/t this and other fantasy/SF series and Japanese manga. :)The only reason this gets a 4 in place of a 5 is the gender politics. You can make of it what you will, but obviously men are the villians here, and, unfortunately, it's beyond their control due to the tainted nature of saidin, the male magic. But I suppose that this is a mirror of the real world for the male writer, being the pawn of women.Overall, a great book."
4,a fun read,"After about 90 pages describing the completely ordinary rural lives of the main characters, you have been lulled into a sense of calm that shatters with a knock on the door by something straight from hell. The characters never stop running from that point on. Supernatural danger is always one step behind them as well as somewhere ahead of them, and there is a growing sense that the fate of the world depends on the actions of these characters.You will discover a detailed and fascinating world. Boys will feel the urge to master the sword, the bow, and the axe. Girls will feel the urge to learn herbal remedies and make their own clothes.This book can be quite annoying and disappointing unless one remembers - it is just for fun. There is no insight, no philosophy, no moral dilemma, etc. That is the kind of fiction I normally read, but this was a nice break - just for fun."
2,dissapointed,"Bought three books from Amazon,two came with dustjackets as expected,one did notAmazon would not or could not provide one as the purchase actually went thru twodifferent book sellers,they bothssaid it was a problem between me and Amazon. My option is to send itback (wherer I haven't a clue)and try again hoping the book would come with a dustjacket.I would not have purchased this particular book if in the descrption had mentioned no dustjacket.Just very dissapointed in the pass the buck senario surrounding this transaction!!."
3,Not that impressed.,"I didn't really think this was all that good - and, since the series is never going to end, I think I'll stop here. It was interesting - but mostly gripping since I was looking forward to resolutions, but there are none. To me, he's making it up as he goes along - and without a plan there can be no finale. Tolkien is by far still the best fantasy writer ever: and it's in large part due to immense planning on his part. While there are a billion tales / in it's own way never ends, they all stem from a planned world. Wheel of Time is just a mess in my opinion."
2,Blech,"I wasn't sure of this book even while reading through the prolouge (which, by the way, may be my favorite part of the entire book). Jordan's writing, though flawed, had a pleasant flow to it despite a bit of redundancy and the like. But when it comes to his subject....I about hurled.Let me explain, first of all, that I rarely dislike books. When I do, the reason is most always the same: because I don't like the characters. Barely half-way into the prolouge, I was disgusted with the people that made up Jordan's world. How could they be so horribly afraid of the man that would save their world from complete and utter destruction?! It made no sense.I went on to finish the book and remained unsatisfied. I deeply disliked the main character, and that usually means that I won't be continueing the series. If it weren't for a few minor characters that were barely touched on, though interesting, I would have put the book down long before finishing it."
2,"Read the 1, 2, and 3 star reviews first!!!","The subject says it all. To paraphrase those reviews: Robert Jordan has taken 3, *maybe* 4, good tight fantasy books and stretched them out to 9 (soon to be 10, 11, or 12) books. Prolix, verbose, redundant, take your pick; they sum it all up very nicely.Don't start unless you have tons of time to waste and don't care about mindnumbing repetition.[rancidpeanutbutter]"
1,Just Started,think its olrite book good prologue but if it is like the lord of the rings (which i think is the most boring book i've ever read) but i wouldn't buy it and you better of reading song of ice and fire a better book than wheel of time by george rr martin
3,Okay book,I thought this book was okay. I had read all of salvatores drizzt books and went to these i think that the salvatores and other forgottent realms are better and more of what I think fantasy has. It has some good points and some bad ones i suggest you read this book. And if you have the time read my favorite books the Drizzt books.
2,What is the big deal?,"I know I am not supposed to ask that, lest I incur the wrath of Jordan zealots with their poorly spelled, overly-punctuated, loudly capitalized reviews. You've got to wonder what an author has to inspire almost Oprah-like devotion.I'm not sure it's talent, because while he is the best writer of the current bunch of Tolkein imitators (which is not necessarily heaping praise; Brooks and Goodkind are two of the most average writers around), he's fooling people with a huge marketing gimmick (Wheel of Time saga? Please, put it in thee volumes and think up something new) and fragmented, verbose plots with recycled themes and wooden characters.It's entertaining for what it is, a wordy fairy tale."
5,A good piece of fantasy literature,"Let me just start by saying that this is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I couldnt put it down as Jordan's world just pulls you in. The only downfall to this book, and the series for that matter is that Jordan tends to drag things out to longer than what they should be. I defenitely think some of his books could be a lot shorter. While its no Lord of the Rings, the Wheel of Time series is a good investment. I recommend it for any fantasy fan."
2,Will he ever finish?,"I think Bobby Jordan will be dead before he finishes this saga. Eye of the World was a good book, not great, but good. But the man has so many plot threads into the story by the fourth book, that you have RE-read every book before it so you dont forget what happened! SO eventually, when you get to the 10th or 11th book, you will be doing nothing but reading Jordan ALL the time, waiting for the next book to come out!Save your sanity, don't even start on this saga. FOLKS! This book came out in 1993! It is almost TEN YEARS LATER and he still is nowhere ready to finish the series!DO NOT START ! You will either get addicted or insane..."
4,Excellent!,"A friend just lent me this book, the first in the series. It sat on my shelf for awhile before I bothered to crack it open - I expected not to like it for some reason. Boy was I wrong! Once I started, I couldn't put it down! I read the whole book in 2 days, staying up late into the night devouring every word. It looked like a long book, but I wanted it to be longer! And I note with glee that there are already at least 8 books in the series, so it will be awhile before I've exhuasted the series. If you don't read quicky I suppose it could get tiresome, there are some side-ways Jordan takes you down, but I found it all interesting and captivating. Now I can't wait to find out what happens to everyone next - his characters feel very alive and real, even when fighting Darkfiends and Trollocs."
3,Wouldn't read again.,"I started this series about two years ago, but never finished it. The first book was okay, and arguably the best out of the series. If I were to rate all of what I've read so far, which is about 5 books, I would actually give it a 2.I did like the first book though. My favorite character was Lan, but I hated the town 'wisdom', can't remember her name. This book series could have been really great, but at book 3 or 4 it started going downhill fast. I regret having started to read it because it ended up disappointing me so much."
2,A LOTR and Dune copycat,"Aes Sedai...... copied from Herbet's Dune series, and from there everything gets worse. Emond Field.... Well his version of Tolkien's The Shire, Trollocs .....Tolkien's Orcs and the mydraal well Tolkien's wring wraiths. even the settings were not that original....Caemlyn....Tolkien's Moria, Tar Valon.....Minas tirith.....Man Jordan needs some originality"
5,Stop comparing to tolkien,"i fhave read this book and i have loved this book. It is amazing from the character desciption to the depth of the new world that is brought to us, i read this book in three days.i have a problem with people though, STOP COMPARING HIM TO TOLKIEN, i am sure that when he wrote this book he did not want to be compared to tolkien, this is different to tolkien, and in my view, having read both tolkien and jordan, this is better!"
2,I knew better at the time...,"but I read the first book anyway in 1996. And the first book was quite good, however I knew there were up to 10 books in this series and knew it must become stale after awhile. As such, I didn't read another volume until 2005, only because I had just moved and didn't have anything else to read until my stuff arrived from Maryland. So, I read the second book, which wasn't bad, followed by the 3rd book, which was too soon. All of the characters idiosyncracies were getting annoying, the new bad guys didn't seem nearly as dangerous as the old ones, and the Dark One was again (temporarily) defeated at the end. If RJ can't resolve a story in the same number of books it took Tolkien, then I care not to continue, especially as the plot seems to be waning already in book 3. Subsequent books, I imagine must be mind-numbing."
1,highly over rated,"This book (along with the next 2 in the series) is a readable book. My problem with it is that the characters for the most part are completely unlikable and come across as very annoying. Nynave tops the list. She spends the entire book (and the following 2) blaming all of the worlds problems on Moraine and plotting a way to get revenge even through Moraine has only helped her. Then there is Matt who cries the whole time and cant seem to take and order from anyone. Perrin who manages to gain a cool power, pisses and moans that he is a freak because of his power instead of using it to help out. The other problem I have with the series is that all of the power (political, Magic) is held by the women of the story. This may sound sexist but I just can't picture being scared of ""the women's circle"" or being bossed around by a 20ish wisdom (Nynave). These two items manage to leave the story tainted, and 3 out of the 9+ were enough for me."
2,There is alot out there that is better than this,"Despite the fact that I was captivated by Jordan's first few books, his series becomes quite annoying by the tenth book. I didn't even finish CoT because it was so boring. Alot of people say that Jordan makes super descriptions. He does, but CoT is basically just a waste of paper full of useless and aggravating dialogue. It is just about a gaggle of witless girls blushing and talking about pregnancy. I was very disappointed with this series. It is like a drug that feels good at first, but eventually leaves one feeling deprived. If you are looking for good fantasy try authors like:George R.R. MartinTerry GoodkindTerry BrooksThese three authors alone are alot of reading. George R.R. Martin is the best."
4,Standard Story Starts off Slow but Picks up: BUT BE WARNED,"I have two parts to my review of this book: The first is that Eye of the World starts rather slow and picks up to the point where it becomes an excellent story, if very standard. (youth in village leave on quest,led by a spell caster of power: hhhm, sounds like Tolkein, eh?) The characters are great and develop in very clear and wonderful ways. Jordan shows a great eye for characters.The second part of my review is to be careful. Jordan's latest books in the series are terrible by comparison and do a great injustice to the first books in the series. Please do yourself a favor and read the reviews for Crown of Swords and Path of Daggers before picking up this book. My feeling is that after the great disappointment in Jordan's lack of pacing and storytelling, I WOULD NOT start this series. You are warned."
4,My First Fantasy,"I have been wanting to start off on the journey of fantasy for some time now, since I read The Hobbit, by Tolkein. After I started out with Wheel of Time, I just couldnt put it down. I am on the 3rd book now. The imagination and the plots in the story leaves me gasping in wonder. I am there with Rand, Perrin and Mat, fighting the battles, feeling the confusions, and depair... I would suggest it to anybody who would want something different to read, something beautiful and grand in its scale."
2,third time is the fail,"try as i might i could not finish this book - i have begun the novel at three different times in my life, and this is the third and final try - i cannot do it - i do not like nor care for the characters nor do i like or care for the purpose - there is plenty of narrative that goes no where and very little actual movement once the story does start - the beginning is always great and then it goes from 200 MPH to broken down on the side of the road for me, which is a shame, because i know that this series will stand the test of time, just not on my book shelves."
2,"Starts off with a bang, degenerates rapidly","I'm about 5 books into the series and want to review for those people that don't like starting series that rapidly decline.The first book was good, with good characters, decent writing. Then it starts rolling downhill like a snowball from Mount Everest.By the 4th book, the author is mostly focusing on useless characters that add nothing to the plot and just take up page space.Rand, the main character essentially paints the author into a corner by being too powerful (the whole series could have ended if he just held 2 items at the same time)Every single female character fuses and melts into 1 uber shrew, that competes for the title of world's biggest stereotype. I honestly ended up skipping chapters when I saw they were about Nynaeve. Not sure what this reveals about the author.The quality of the writing goes down. Entire sentences are repeated. Pages are devoted to crossing a street.TLDR: Read the first book and stop, or skip the series if you can't."
2,Too many pages for not enough story,"The longer the book, the greater the obligation to make every page count. This book does not live up to that obligation. It gets stuck in a rut less than half way through, uses filler as a failed attempt to make up for the monotony, then finally manages to dig itself out just before the very end. Do yourself a favor and pick something else."
5,exciting amalgam of contrasting forces of light and darkness,"the intricate weave of seperate plot lines and completelyoriginal characters blends into an intriguing tapestry ofa complex, brilliantly detailed mythical land of epicproportions. the depth of personality present in everyonefrom the lowliest of the beggars to the lord of thewhitecloaks is astounding. the way that jordan presentsthe concepts of the good, the evil, and those in between,such as the dark one and the creator, the forsaken and theaes sedai, is both stimulating and captivating. Also, somegroovy plot twists, man:)"
4,slow start,this was one of the hardest books to get into. but i enjoyed it in the end. i have read the first 3 books in this series. i may skip the rest and read the newest one that just came out.
5,Thoroughly Entertaining,"I am loving this series! It lacks the majestic tone of Tolkien, however, Jordan makes up for it by creating a fantasy world with all the depth necessary to build an epic tale. I am easily discouraged my some fantasy books because they often rip of Tolkien's ideas. Parallels to Tolkiens work appear more to honour Tolkien in their similarities, and Jordan's characters stand all on there own.The Eye of the World provides an edge-of-your seat introduction to the series, I am into book 3 and its grip has not been released. Thanks to Mr. Jordan for his hard work."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,I was forced into reading it. HORRIBLE. If you want something truly original try MAR Barker's Flamesong. It is not the typical quest to save the world like this book. Also recommended Tolkien and Herbert.
1,Rip-off of Tolkien,This book just plain sucks. It is so obviously a rip-off of Tolkien it's not funny. I guess you could find it reasonable if you enjoy endless mounds of descriptive garbage.
3,poor book construction,"The story itself is a good read; I'll probably read the series. Problem is, the book had thirty pages missing! I'm not so sure buying through Amazon is trustworthy."
3,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T DO IT!!!","Please, promise me you won't read this book...sure its a great introduction to a series...yes the characters are wonderful...but in the end, you'll be soooo disappointed.The author is just calling these in to take advantage of young fantasy fans. First 4 or 5 books are fine, but after awhile...nothing happens.Please, read something with a beginning, middle, and (most importantly) an end.Don't support this dreck."
3,"Action great, characters average","Eye of the World has good action, but suffers from weak characterization. After reading the book the greatest differences I found between Rand, Mat, and Perrin are: their weapons, their appearance, and the fact that Mat jokes. The women have more varied personalities, but unlike the men, a clear description of how the women look is not evident. By Jordan's descriptions they are all ""pretty"", and Morraine is short and slim, you can thank the cover artist for that one. Lan and Morraine are very reserved, their is little mirth or humour in them, unlike Aragorn or Gandalf. The book is well paced in terms of action, but the interludes really reveal the lack of character complexity."
3,Entertaining and well written,"The book was well written and fast paced. I thought character development was weak. It had a lot of action, so I might have given it 4 stars when I was younger, but I prefer more substance and thought."
5,A wonderful start!!,"This is one of those books that is awesome as you read it, and only after you move on to the other books in the series do you realize how it was really just a beginning. For me, the series doesn't really get going until The Shadow Rising, everything else before that is just setting the stage! My favorite series by far!!"
5,My opinion of a GREAT book,"Ok, I absolutely love the Wheel of Time and the Eye of the World(duh). As I read the bad reviews of this book and series, I have two feelings toward these reviewers. One is curiousity, about why and how someone could live without loving WOT. The other is pity, that tey can't understand something like it. People complain that he uses too much description. I love it. I gobble up every description, as i brings me closer to this world that I seem to live in more often than here. As for complaining about the length, that is pathetic. If you can't read a book this long, than you don't deserve to. And the wait. Come on, you guys! I'd like to see any one of you write a thousand page book in a year that comes remotely close to a WoT book. I would just like to ssay that i think that this is the best seven books that exist(and I have read a lot, _incuding_ Tolkein). I can't wait fr TPoD!"
3,"Entertaining, Easy read",Reading this book you can kind of tell it is a first of a series. The content is good but the way the story is told you can tell the author wants to say so much more but is afraid to becuase he doesn't want to bore his reader. It is a must read in order to introduce yourself to the characters. The strange thing is that the characters are all too alike...only about five character types stand out and the rest kind of fall in behind one of those types. I haven't yet read the rest of the trilogy but hope it is written a little better.
5,An excellent book for all!,"This is an excellent fantasy book. Having never read fantasy before, I was skeptical, but this book captivated me. The 6 that follow it are even better, if that is possible. I can only say that I am dying for the next book to come out! Robert Jordan creates a complex world with its own rich culture and history. Try book 1, and you will be hooked!"
1,bland bland bland,"Must have been asleep the last few years or else subconsiously ignoring this series as I've only just read this, the first one. Thought it was one of those 1970 fantasies; the 1st generation of post LOTR books and as such could forgive its obvious ripoffs and dull dull characters and chaste dialogue. But......then I realised it was written in 1990. Come on, this is criminal, it is so lacking in originality its like a joke. Who the hell agreed to publish this and dear god how can anyone find it engaging. There is so much more interesting fantasy out there; beautiful; funny; shocking; and imaginative. The Eye Of The World is none of these. You should be deeply ashamed Robert Jordan."
1,Tolkein Rip!!,"Just a rip of Tolkein's ""Lord of the Rings"" (a classic novel.) Jordan is unimaginative, dull and drull. I guess that pretty much says it. This book bites!"
5,You WILL fall in love with this... but be warned,"The Wheel of Time is one of the best known Fantasy series to date. It is very good... most of it. This book is one of the best it has to offer. As you move through the series, however the series slowly begins to lose its edge. Around book 5 you notice a drop in the overall quality of the books... but thankfully it doesn't drop much lower after that (think Goodkind) and just stays at that level. If you choose to read this book, you will probably love it, finish all the series' books released to date, and eventually finish the series, even if some of the succeeding books aren't nearly as good. This book IS great, but be warned that if you start you will almost certainly HAVE to ""finish"" (if Jordan and you happen to live that long)."
5,Must read,This book is the first in a great new series by Robert Jordan. Jordan has gotten many complements on his works in these books. This book is very well written with some of the best discription around. It has great plots and you will find that you cannot put it down.Jordan has made a book that must be read!
2,"Been there, done that...","The repetition in this book started geting funny after the first four hundred pages or so. Every time one of the village boys encountered a serving-maid, I'd say along with them, ""Wish ____ was here, he knew how to talk to girls!""I'll bet the book could have been shorter without all the deja vu events, not to mention the neverending journey to Tar Valon, or wherever they were going. Jordan has good ideas, but that's some massive overwriting. And there was nothing original about the characters. Lan's the usual strong-silent type who falls in love with a woman he can't have. Rand et al are the innocents loose in the big dangerous world, discovering their talents. The villain (or villains) is never developed either.What settled it for me was the glossary, where the main clans of the Trollocs were named. The names are fancy misspellings of Devil (Dha'vol), Goblin (Ghob'blun), Golem, Demon, Banshee and other fantastic creatures. Great puns. Ha ha. Terry Pratchett did it better."
1,Atrocious!!!,"This movie is so bad it is actually BAD!!!I couldn't even get through it; was there a payoff good enough to get ANYONE to actually watch the entire movie?? The only saving grace was Mickey Rourke, and he was eliminated in the first 10 minutes. This is one of those truly awful movies where the producer owes me an hour of my life back for the time I put in- I was wiling to give it chance, but it didn't deserve one."
3,Believe the hype,"I bought these a couple of weeks ago for skydiving and have been fairly happy with them. I like the versatility of lens colors and like the ability to swap between the head strap and traditional sunglass temples. When I tightened the head strap up for jumping, they fogged a little, but I've never seen a set of tight goggles that didn't fog at some point. They work well as sunglasses and goggles as far as I can tell. I wouldn't say they're the best on the market, but am not dissatisfied with the purchase.The lenses are easy to swap, but I'm a bit leary of the clasps that hold them in...they seem somewhat frail in comparison to the rest of the construction."
2,not what promised,Wiley promised glases that would be good in a combat situation where a soldier could jump out of a plane and be involved in a firefight. So I thought they would atleast work well as carpenter safety glases. Well I don't know if soldiers can see throught fog but these glasses continualy fog up. Whats worse is that there web site brags about an anti bolistic anti fog coating. The ten dollar pair of safety glasses I bought at lowes behave better than these and never fog up. The only good thing is the gogle like strap that you can attach. For a carpenter in high places this is a plus
5,These are awesome,"Xmas gift for my niece, she loves them. Very stylish and the classic Chuck Taylor look. Definitely worth the money...assuming she doesn't outgrow them too quick."
4,Cute Baby book,Very complete book. Lots of room for photos too. Good for those who want to write. Even has a page for each parent to write a letter to the child.
2,Strained grandeur,"2 1/2At best a rustic modesty can briefly compliment ambitious rock but most of the early 70's, poorly recorded Italian prog debut cannot hang a melodic hat around compelling compositions and instead often runs through disconnected fragments."
2,Not Worth It,"This is only getting 2 stars because of VZ. All the other girls are skanks. Their dancing is NOT sexy, just sleazy. VZ only has two scenes, the rest are filled with these washed up, blown out and ugly strippers. The production is cheap, the music is terrible, the announcer is VERY annoying and it cost too much for promising more VZ than is actualy delivered. Don't buy it. You'll be better off spending that cash on a bottle of your favorite booze. This was my first and LAST purchase with the HARD BODY name. What a let down."
1,Just be careful that you get the right reader,"I find Cyrus Vance's readings of the Aubrey-Maturin series to be very unpleasant listening. He makes Jack sound like a pompous jerk and Steven like some kind of effeminate twit.Patrick Tull was the master in this category. With his readings, you don't really need any ""he saids"" because you can always tell from the voice which character is speaking. The regional British accents, the accents of foreigners speaking English - they are all spot-on. With Tull, you soon forget that you're being read to, so involved do you become in the story. With Cyrus Vance, you're always aware that someone is reading to you, and not very well. So, be advised: be careful which reading you are purchasing."
3,Good value,Great service as always. Books are attractive and seem well constructed but the printing and editing leaves something to be desired.
3,Somewhat dull but enigmatic story,"As an avid reader of the Aubrey/Maturin series I found this book to the one of the weakest in the series. That's probably because I enjoy the sea battles most and this was primarily a leisurely cruise. The story certainly does confirm Jack Aubrey's previous contention that women aboard a ship causes nothing but problems! A puzzle for me is why the title was selected since the role of the HMS Truelove was so minimal? The one battle in the book was not particularly heroic but to O'Brian's credit he doesn't duck reality. Finally, knowing how O'Brian weaves characters from book to book, I'm sure it was necessary to become intimately acquainted with Clarissa who probably will play an important future role regarding the final exposure of the top spy in the British Government. As always, I look forward to reading the next book in this wonderful series, The Wine-Dark Sea."
3,Quite surprised to see an unknown Aubrey/Maturin novel,"This book was originally published in the UK and Canada under the title ""Clarissa Oakes"" and was standard fare for the series (excellent reading but only a 6 when compared to the others). If the above review mentioning a vessel by the name of Truelove is correct, then we have some editorial differences between the 2 volumes but since I haven't been able to compare them, I don't know any more details.."
1,Where is Mr. Tull?,"Why is Simon Vance re-reading these books? It does him no credit, as he cannot compare to Patrick Tull. The late Mr. Tull was born to read these books."
1,Just a real bore - book is good for hardcore fans only,"I had to stop listening to this book at the end of disk 5 of 8. Why do I tell you that? I was over halfway done with the book and just had to give up. Nothing was happening. Nothing. The only thing this book had going was that a woman was on the ship, Aubrey is clueless and ornery, and that they were all headed to Oahu. That's it. Pretty thin for any novel at the halfway point.This book was a solid letdown and had zero action in it well over halfway through the story. The only appeal I can see for this book is for readers who are devotees to the series, and who don't mind a bunch of filler."
2,Probably the low point for the opus.,"I've been reading the entire series in order and this book really slowed me down. I thought the plot was tedious and lacking in direction. I think O'Brian's imagination was flagging a bit when he created the Clarissa Oakes character.I have higher hopes for the final five installments in the series.If you are just starting out with the series, start with # 3, H.M.S. Surprise."
1,Dull and weighed down by jargon,"In high school, I was assigned to read this book and do a paper on it. It's one of the dullest books I've ever read, because there is so much unfamiliar sea-jargon that I was unable to visualize the main characters' surroundings. The plot was dull, I could care less about the characters, and after reading it, I could not describe what had happened plotwise. I think this book is appropriate for sea-lovers, because they would find the sea terminology interesting, but for the lay reader, it's like being thrown overboard without knowing how to swim."
2,Not a great book,"I agree 100% with Annie Murphy's review. This is not a book that's really going to help a new dad and it's intended message is mostly wasted because those who actually need it would never read it. Also, it seems very repetitive. I'd sum the entire book up as ""love your kids and don't be afraid to show it""."
5,Pleasure from the first word. . .,"I enjoyed this book from the first word. It moves along with a very upbeat approach to life, pointing out the lovely, the poignant, and the humorous as the author goes about his interesting job inspecting village schools. As a teacher, I can verify the truth of his experiences, and he tells them in an engaging manner.The book does compare with James Herriot. If you enjoy Jan Karon,or Miss Read, Gervase Phinn will be pleasant reading, too."
4,This is a classic,This is the best of Raffel Cameron.If you enjoy his music then this a must for your collection-I should know ;-)
4,"What a lovely book!! ""A Love Story"" is right!!","If I had been Liz Sheridan I would have hung on to him with all my might even with his ""moods"" and his moving forward in his career while she felt she was standing still!! But...hindsight, right? This is a MUST read for James Dean fans but more than that it's a beautifully written love story, and a paen to NYC in the 1950's. A time and place for all things exciting and a great time for the young to be young. And Jimmy, oh...Jimmy...how lovely it seemed you were even though definitely not perfect. And I loved both of them (although there was some very ""personal"" info I almost blushing during reading; didn't find it necessary to include.) If this were a work of fiction it would make a beautiful novel, too. Liz Sheridan, whether you know it or not, YOU'RE A WRITER!!! I felt I was there, with both of you ""locked out of the world."" God bless you for such a joy!"
5,Oh Jimmy,"Well, I read this in 24 hours, couldn't put it down. Pretty intense stuff. I cried .. more than once ..too beautiful really.And to the last reviewer up there ...Liz kept journals of her early days in NY, so she took a lot of the quotes and memories out of there. So ease up!This is the real James Dean.I think this is probably the warmest book about him to date.And you actually feel his energy and the times through her writing. It's a great world to get lost in for a while."
5,GREAT LOVE STORY,"Well I've read a few James Dean books..I just love him. I personally liked this one the best because you get an inside look on what it was like to date James Dean. I recommended it to my best friend who also loves him, and her whole family has now read it too because it's so great. If you want a good book on how Jimmy was as a boyfriend, this is the one you should get. It's great!"
1,Liz is hoping for a movie deal,"Liz's style hints at hopes for a movie deal. The book reads like the screenplay of a made for TV movie. I must confess that this annoyed me. She tells her story in dialog and descriptions that could double as scene notes. Who can remember their past to the point of everything being in quotations? especially conversations from at least a half century ago! She denys wanting to be one of those profiting from a relationship with James Dean, yet I can see not other reason for her writing this book. Money must have gotten tight after Sienfeld. If she really wanted people to know the ""Jimmy"" she knew, better to have kept his letters. She says she burned them after he died.The women I know only burn letters from lovers when they get dumped. No Offense Liz, but I was not impressed."
1,not as advertised,"Purchased this book as ""new"" and paid top dollar for it. When it arrived the book jacket was torn and wrinkled and there were black ink markings made along the face of the pages. Returned it immediately, as this was to have been a gift."
4,does what it says,its a sawzall blade. It does what is advertised. it cuts through steel with moderate ease. don't go to fast or you will heat the blade and it will lose its temper and then it wont cut. if you have lubricant use it for thick steel
4,Spirit of the west.,"This album is pretty good but there are a few flaws.First of all this album captures the spirit of the western united states very well. Its very good to listen to on road trips and such. The songs are easy to sing along to and the song are catchy too. I would describe it as Acoustic folk/country.This album is rediculously simple, the songs are written well, but the guitarist uses all your basic chords in all the songs. This is a good thing but i think he could of added some other more interesting chord changes and melodys but generally for this style of music its good to keep simple. There are good mixes of faster and slower songs in it too.This album sounds simular to Hayden and has a very lonely feel to it. It makes you realize the beauty of nature but also makes you feel lonely.I would check it out if i were you."
5,Great cd,"This is a great cd.The more I listen to it the more I love it.I'm a big Uncle Tupelo-alternative country fan and I think this sounds similar.But,I hav'nt heard anything this good in a while.The music and the words are both great.I cant belive this is the same guy that sang on the Handsome cd.I liked that one too.I hope this is'nt another one shot deal for Jeremy Chatelain.You made a great cd,man."
1,"I have no Faith in Faith Fairchild, only annoyance","Page beats around the bush way too much--the whole ""time out"" where Faith goes to New York was just pointless, and the whole family history murder thing was confusing. Also, Faith whines and complains a lot, and is rather annoying in general. Bad start to what turned out to be a bad series.Note: I've read this entire series up toThe Body in the Attic: A Faith Fairchild Mystery (Faith Fairchild Mysteries), and the best rating I've given any of them is 2 stars, which is sad and says a lot about the series. I kept reading because it really has potential but it never lives up to it, so save yourself the trouble and agony and try a a different series, such as Carolyn Hart'sDeath on Demand (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 1)series, most of which are fun and enjoyable, or stop afterThe Body in the Cast: A Faith Fairchild Mystery, which was probably the best of the series. That's my recommendation, anyway."
3,Slight Indeed!,"Not really much to this. The New England descriptions are nice enough but the heroine is a pain, the story is dragged out -2 paragraphs could probasbly handle it and the sense of the community and being a minister's wife never really comes to life. I wanted a light read and am not adverse to this type of book with a female heroine. But can't say I will rush out to get more in this series."
5,Terrific Treat!,"The most important statistics: Our 2 year old daughter loves this book; we read it 4 times in a row when it first arrived, and a week later, it's still her favorite. The book introduces all the Halloween essentials, from dressing up to getting treats. As you read you can play along with the characters, marching, stomping and spooking. Best of all are the simple, fun drawings of the classic halloween icons, including a ghost, wolf-man and of course, a pirate! This is a delightful book- I highly recommend it."
4,a great cd,"this is the first salsoul gold master in a series of three. this This the best one. all the songs are terriffic. true you get the salsoul hustle on Salsouls greatest hits but not the extended version! then you have the dance a little bit closer by charo. at first hearing it might sound corny but after a few plays its very hypnotic. then you get the smaller talents that are not on the Salsoul classics 1-4. The best on here are Dance a litle bit closer, helplessly, Falling in love, Love is finally comin' my way. The others are unreleased versions you already have if you got the Salsoul classics 1-4. My least favorite is love is you."
3,Not Original....,"This cd has all the songs that i used to listen to and miss, but I can tell that they aren't by the original artists themselves. It just doesn't sound the same. But it's a good cd to listen to when you want to remember the songs."
1,Who authorized this?,Does anyone realize that these are not the original performers of these songs? And they sound awful!!
4,A real keeper,"I've got to say, as a graphic artist and a history buff, this Rocco book sets really high marks. I'm impressed with almost everything about it. It has the feel of a book that is a real keeper, maybe even a kind of cult classic. I appreciate the ""montage"" effect of image and text -- it's a real tribute to Rocco as an artist that he can evoke so much emotional impact in his work."
5,Amazing techno-house!!!,"I really wish i could describe how great this cd is, but my words cannot do it justice. Just buy the cd and listen to it. If you are a fan of great house music, or are just really open-minded when it comes to electronic music, this cd will absolutely blow you away. The only way I came across this group is because Fatboy Slim has used a couple of their tracks in his live cd's. Norman Cook is usually a god when it comes to knowing what tracks will make a dance floor explode, and there's a damn good reason he's used this group in his sets."
2,Electronica Buying Guide 101,"Yet another example in my electronica collection of what not to do when buying music. I bought this album for the sole reason that I heard the Saints and Sinner's remix of Santos' camels on some Ministry of Sound Annual compilation. Loved it...but not a good reason to buy some dude's album for the sake of recognizing one track! The album is poor overall, and to add salt in the wound, the original camels track found on this album is no where near as good as Saint and Sinner's remix! Win some, lose some.2.5/5 stars."
3,Plays well...Sound uneven,"The Bass has a good fret board playability, but sound is uneven from low strings to the high strings (volume is loud on E,A strings and soft on D,G strings). One of the screws was missing out of the volume/tone panel and the transducers on the high strings was loose inside the body upon arrival. The old saying...""you get what you pay""."
1,Didn't work for me,"Ordered the Dean 5 String acoustic bass. The first one had no output when plugged in to amp. Returned it and a new one was sent. That one had real uneven volume: some stings real loud and others had hardly any output. Returned that one too, received a full refund. Liked the bass action, look, and feel. I think it just needs a better pickup system. Also no battery, so it's passive not active."
2,Unhappy.,The guitar was package very badly with little to no cushion or protection. The guitar came in a smaller box inside a rather pointless large box. The guitar was just sliding around inside. The body of the guitar was CRACKED when I opened it and I had to pay $44! to return it for a new one. Amazon.com is only covering 10 dollars of the shipment. I am very unhappy with the situation. The guitar itself did not seem very loud for how large the body is but it was cracked so hopefully the new one sounds better.
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,Absolutely horrible. Buzzes terribly on every fret of every string. It's a beautiful guitar but the sound is awful. Definitely want my money back. Don't waste your time
4,"If You're Going To Move, You Need This Book","Your Move was a great book! It included many funny, true stories about the moving experience. Anyone getting ready to move using a moving crew would be well advised to read this book. I learned so much. I had no idea what went on ""behind the scenes"" during a move and was very surprised! The author, Craig Budreau, writes his book with humor and candid honesty. I would recommend this book to any individual or company planning a move using a moving crew. Buy it! You need it!"
3,A moving experience . . .,". . . can bring you problems---if you're moving across the country or just to the other side of your town. But those problems can be fewer and you might well enjoy the moving---if you read this book.The book is packed with short and mostly humorous stories about people and incidents in the moving industry. The stories are about the drivers, packers, warehousemen, rookies, and others who handle your household goods. The short yarns are told by an insider---the author says he worked in the moving business for 20 years.There are ""Tips, Tips and More Tips"" (title of Chapter 4) to help you move successfully ""interstate, intrastate, local, (and with the help of a) brother with pickup truck"" (p. 13).It's a short book and reading it may leave you wishing for more stories, more tips. Still, the book is a ""good read,"" especially if you are about to move and want a fast-and-light easy read."
1,There is nothing there to keep up one's interest!,"Not a very good read. Assorted characters, all tied together very loosely . . . results in no one person to care about.The key to the plot is Kate's revenge. She is rich, apparently smart, and has people fawning all over her. Then why does it turn into a shoot-out at the end of the book, with Kate doing much of the shooting. And, of course, the US President is thrown into the mix, along with the British Secret Service and all kinds of characters from Palestinians to the IRA to a crooked professor and a former US Ambassador.There is nothing there to keep up one's interest!"
3,Uneven Intensity,"Jack Higgins' 'Midnight Runner' begins with great intensity and suspense, setting the novel's expectations, but stumbles about until arriving at a satisfying ending.An extremely wealthy Kate Rashid seeks vengeance on Sean Dillon, his colleagues and the world for the deaths of her brothers. Higgins takes the reader on various detours - like the woes of a former Senator and war hero, and the struggles of an aging hero scouring a deadly desert. While these detours fill pages and bring back some of Higgins's past protagonists, their purposes are unclear and they do not add to the plot.Dillon continues to gain more depth as a character with each book. His relationship with Hannah Bernstein, which was heating up with each novel - grows cold in this one. This leaves Dillon with deep thoughts, but no purpose.No doubt - 'Midnight Runner' is a decent read. There are just too many sub-plots and too many pages as empty as the deserts Higgins describes."
3,"Entertaining for an afternoon's reading , not Higgins' best.","I think I read just about every book that Higgins comes out with and I find myself becoming disenchanted with them. I liked that early one, ""The Eagle Has Landed"" because the attempt to kill Churchill plot was very well done. Too many of Higgins books since then have either built on that first one or followed a similar pattern, Midnight Runner is one of them. I find it entertaining for an afternoon's relaxation but the story is somewhat farfetched (an IRA hitman working for British Intelligence and the crazed half Arab woman out for revenge )and formulaic. Read it for fun, not as great literature."
1,WUI (of Bushmills)?,"Thin and utterly unrealistic plot, poorly written - definitely expected more. Unnecessary detours, constant repetitions and not just the annoying references to Bushmills and unleavened bread - was somebody paid by the word? To consumers: Save your money. To the editors: Did anybody read this before publication?"
1,Reads more like a screenplay than a novel,"Being a stranger to Jack Higgins, but being aware of his reputation, I was really looking forward to this book, but I was very disappointed indeed. Admittedly, I was not aware of the characters from the previous novels, but the characterisations were laughable and the action read more like a screenplay than a novel. The plot flowed swiftly, but not in a stylish way, more in a ""Sean did this, Kate did that, so Sean did something else"". It was more reminiscent of a high-school story than anything.If you want to read a good novel, with real suspense, that requires some emotional engagement, try some Ian McEwan."
4,Vintage Jack Higgins,If you like Jack Higgins character Sean Dillon you will enjoy the book. It does have an interesting twist or 2. Higgins is able to keep the character fresh and at the same time keep you familiar with them.
4,Midnight Runner,Another good Jack Higgins effort. Sean Dillon continue to both amaze and be reasonable at the same time. Good read.
2,a thriller? not even close,"Maybe I'm missing something...I've read and loved tons of ""thrillers"" but Midnight Runner just didn't keep my attention. It actually became a chore to read this book. It had some bright moments, but all in all it wasn't suspenseful, the characters were not that interesting, and the action was extremely hackneyed. Don't waste your time with this book, it's mediocre at best."
2,Good story spoiled by reader,There is a difference between reading a novel and acting in a play--a distinction that escapes Patrick Macnee as he narrates this book. An otherwise good story is ruined by dramatic overacting and misplacing of emphasis until at times it's difficult to even comprehend the meaning of a sentence. The reading was so bad that I'm reluctant to comment on the novel as I was too distracted and annoyed by Macnee.
1,Horrible Excuse for an Audio Book!!!,"This is without a doubt the WORST and most UNPROFESSIONAL production of an audio book I have ever made an attempt to listen to. Patrick Macnee does a horrible job of reading this novel. His voice inflection and attempts to convey the context of the novel are amateurish at best.It is my practice to purchase books on tape for long business road trips. I picked this one up at a local Boarder's book store ($29.95) and settled in to listen to it this past weekend on a trip from Fort Worth to Kansas City, MO. I was sorely disappointed! Macnee is extremely difficult to listen to. His attempt to take on the various characters in ""Midnight Runner"" is like listening to fingernails on a blackboard! I could not listen to his rendition past CD number 2 and thus have wasted the money spent on this worthless piece of work.I have learned my lesson! I will be certain to avoid ALL books on tape in the future read by Patrick Macnee!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I am an unabashed Higgins fan who has tried to get his hands on almost everything he has written. Each springtime I eagerly await the release of his latest effort. In short, my standards for Higgins is high. And that is why I am very disappointed by this book. The characters are two-dimensional and the story flat. It's a shame; the formula was there for a great story. I will still eagerly wait next spring for the next new Higgins novel. But unlike other years, I will not be recommending this year's effort to my friends."
4,Midnight Runner,"Jack Higgins returns again with his usual bunch of characters.This time around it's Lady Kate Rashid's turn to seek vengeance on the President of the USA as well as Sean Dillon and others. It seems her three brothers were killed attempting to assassinate the president (Edge of Danger). Kate Rashid is one the richest women in the world and thus, has the power to get what she wants. Needless to say, she has no idea what she's soon to come up against: Sean Dillon, Blake Johnson, Harry and Billy Salter, Roper, Daniel Quinn and others.A fast-paced thriller. The character of Sean Dillon is reminding me more and more of a character by the name of Dirk Pitt. You thriller readers know whom I'm talking about. Somehow you just know that no task is impossible. Of course Dirk still rules. This novel was comparable to the previous Dillon novels.A suspenseful and quick read.Recommended"
4,"Excellent mix, shame about the crowd","Do you really want a crowd chanting ""the roof is on fire"" and making oo oo noises over some of the best music from Salsoul, mixed and presented extremely well in most parts by a legend? No, nor would I. Take the crowd out and you have 5 stars, it makes an excellent mix CD very difficult to appreciate in parts so be warned."
5,"Very good read, enjoyable!","This was my first book by the Author and I really enjoyed it. Being born and raised in Florida, I enjoyed the descriptive feeling that was in the book, the humidity, bugs, rainshowers and of course the Characters. (Things we Floridians live everyday!) I am already on my third book written by Ms. Alam!"
1,Not for scuba divers,"I got excited reading the description of this book, expecting not only a good mystery, but some interesting dive scenes. I plodded through the story but from the very beginning it was apparent that Ms. Alam is not a diver and apparently thought only people who know nothing about scuba diving or cave diving would read her book. This diver won't waste his money on any more as her lack of knowledge of even fundamental equipment and terminology is a turnoff to me. Don't waste your time if you want a story that is scuba oriented. By the way Ms. Alam, even a new dive student half way through certification knows to call them FINS, not flippers."
1,Horrific,"To my dismay, my girlfriend brought home this CD after a day of gallivanting the area tag sales. I reluctantly agreed to let her play it on the way to a friend's dinner rehearsal in Barcelona at the Otto Zutz. After 45 minutes of pure hell, I basically concluded on the spot that this CD might be the worst compilation in the history of digital recordings. The only thing missing is the dubious ""Whomp There It Is"". If you truly desire this CD you're either a 10 year old waking up from a 4-year coma or a moron in general."
3,Too ambitious for its own good,"It's hard to fault someone for trying something ambitious in comics, but this just didn't work out right. It's a story of alternate realities, with the title character able to shift between them. Someone or something is threatening the whole of it, and Luther Arkwright works to save the day(s). The artwork is entirely black & white and seems to shift between a smooth, clean look and one that is almost pointillistic. The real problem, though, is the writing: not that it's bad, just that sometimes there isn't nearly enough to make sense of what's going on, and other times a page is almost entirely prose. Ultimately, the numerous shifting realities leave the book disjointed, and the writing doesn't help the reader catch up to the changing perspective. My recommendation: there is a later series called Heart of the Empire which should makes its way to the graphic novel format. Pick that up when it does, and if you want some more background information, then pick this up."
4,Though dating to the early 90's this album is still great.,"Although released in early 90's Audio Adrenaline's premire album is still great today. With hit's like DC-10, PDA, and Life, this CD still rocks and never strays from the message of Jesus Christ."
1,Complete Garbage,the only way to describe this cd is to call it a total piece of garbage. this band cant rock and they cant rap .. corny lyrics that reminds me of why I use to hate Christian bands. by the time I was done lisetning to it I was so ready to just smash it to pieces and throw it in the trash.. what a piece of garbage cd.
3,The birth of Audio A.,"OK OK, so this album can be a little weird in some songs. (Lack of instruments, just singing) But it is a very cool CD, and these guys did very well for their first album."
3,Not there best but God bless 'em,"This is there worst disc but they still send out a great passionate plea in there lyrics even on this album. These guys are great at what they do but this album is full of rap style numbers and it isn't what I am into. Now if you like rap then get this disc cause the lyrics are great. If you are not into rap but want to get into a great band then check out Bloom, Some Kind Of Zombie or Underdog. They are all great and worthy of purchase. I pray God continues to work miracles in the lives of this band and that they continue to strive toward the goal of bringing more souls aboard. Jesus truly saves and this band knows that. God bless all reading this review."
1,Ugh. This stuff is nasty.,"It's really my fault for not understanding what this product was, but I have to say that it's quite a disappointment. I was expecting a ""scrub"" type facial cleanser, but it's actually more like Noxzema cold cream with a little bit of sand added. There's not enough grit for it to really be effective as an exfoliant. It does not lather or leave you with a ""clean"" feeling. In fact, looking at the ingredient list, the primary components are fats - and that's about what it feels like. Good for lifting makeup, perhaps, but not what I'd want for just cleaning my face."
3,No mixing!,"Very good tracks, but didn't mix any of the great songs. A little dissappointed, but will keep the CD anyway. If your not looking for a mix then this CD will give you the enjoyment you need from a Great DJ like Larry Levan."
5,A Nice Time Capsule,If you want to know where House got its sound and how it all got started this CD is required listening. Original House is basically DISCO. Everyone who calls themselves DJs should have ANY AND ALL of Larry Levan's music available because without Him neither Paradise Garage NOR HOUSE music and it's many subgenres (GARAGE Music being one and owes its NAME to the legendary club)would have been what they were. His music selections were not just TOP 40 songs or the garrish POP MUSIC format that has infested modern music today.The songs were better yet the description of the Soul Of A Man. How many DJs TRULY do it like Larry Levan did? I doubt you will find any no matter how good these Djs out here are now there had to be one to pave the way for all the rest.Larry Levan was that one. Buy this CD if you don't have it!!!!
5,a tribute to larry,"This CD is dedicated to greatest dj ever, the selection made by Franois Kevorkian is simply awesome and features some very rare grooves, you should have it already ;)"
2,what's going on?,"the instruction in this tape is lackluster. I've been doing yoga for a few years, and am familiar with all the yoga lingo, but found this DVD hard to follow (you do a lot of work on your back, and can't see the TV, so you rely on their spoken directions, which aren't that great. All, in all--my lower body feels slightly worked out, but mostly my neck aches from straining to see the TV."
5,Yoga/Balance Ball,"My order came very promptly. I haven't had time to use the DVD yet, I've actually gotten to the gym all this time, but she does terrific workouts."
4,Worth seeing,"A story about a mentally challenged mountain man that has kidnapped several women, and plans to hold a contest to see which one will marry him. It opens with him following a woman, knocking her out, then kidnapping her. When she comes to she finds herself trapped with two other women. She discovers that much to her dismay they all seem to have collars that they can't remove safely. One woman explains what she has learned so far. The other seems to be too traumatized to do anything. After meeting the mountain man she suspects there is more going on than meets the eye. There is also word from the mountain man that he will be going to get the last contestant soon. I found this movie worth seeing. The plot was well thought out. The characters were actually believable. It held my attention and made me want to see how it ended. There are some alusions to incestuous abuse of one of the women given as flashbacks so I would not recommend this for children."
5,Interesting little independent film,"I happened to catch this at the theatre and in a small independent ""El Mariachi"" kind of way it was fun. Some of the scenes are dramatically intense, and some of the scenes are graphically intense (think the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan, or the ""cutting off fingers"" scene in Jennifer Tilly's 1996 movie ""Bound."") The story centers on a young mountain man, who kidnaps women for his own reality-tv show--and as presented the story is entirely believable.In this case the mountain man, Stevie, is not an inbreed cannibal, but a slightly retarded young man--who is secretly being manipulated by someone else. The heroine, rather than being a well-endowed bimbo, is well-endowed and smart, and figures out very quickly there is more to their situation than just Stevie's deciding to produced his own television show to find himself a wife. Because of this the knaptid (kidnapped) women's escape attempts are far from typical and are in fact imaginative."
3,Texas Storm History,Good Texas history reading. I read it just after hurricane Ike hit the Texas coast. That made it more interesting.
2,Could Have Been Better,"The best non-fiction film on John Ford is Peter Bogdanovich's John Ford, Director. This one lacks punch and insight. A great subject deserves better treatment."
2,Nothing new,"There's nothing new on this documentary, except for the scenes added in Monument Valley. The Picture Quality is debatable. I could have put thisdocumentary together with what I've already have on John Ford, John Wayne,Henry Fonda and James Stewart. And in better picture quality"
4,do you really need it?,Good SanDisk quality.I bought it along with a cybershot and a 2GB sandisk MS. My computer has a built in card reader and the cybershot comes with a PC-camera cable so I haven't had to use it although it works. I think I'll sell it or give it to someone else.
4,san disk ms reader,"I came in the mail quickly and works great, I think it should come standard with all camera's, but that's me, get one if you don't have one.A++"
1,use less product,I hated it this does not do anything I thought it would when I put my memory cards in for it to read nothing happened DO NOT buy this product
5,This Lil' Thing ROCK!!!!!,"The new sandisk memory stick reader is as tiny as any of the jump drives on the market but it is expandable with bigger memory stick (as they becomes available) so it is kind of like having a tiny removeable drive for under $20. This is like a Zip Drive killer. It eliminated a ton of various dongles from my desk.I installed my Sandisk Mobilemate in under 2 minutes. All my computers (98, XP, XP Pro) recognized the device without a hitch. And it ran super fast when I tested a 256MB stick. I have yet tried a larger size stick because I don't have one. I also need to try it on other non PC devices.A #1! Thanks Sandisk for a great product at a super nice price! Now I can save my money (was going to buy a mini cruzer) to get a 1G stick. Can't wait!"
1,Stupid Buy-Not for SD,"I agree with previous review. I bought it for an SD card reader. SD cards don't fit. Why buy a 4-in-1 reader, when it won't read the 1 SD card I have? Buy another one..."
2,Flimsy,It does the job but is very flimsy.The memory stick is inserted sideways and is not locked in place causing it to drop out with ease.The side slot also creates an awkward shape and at times can not be inserted in tight USB slots.
5,Finally on DVD!,"I saw this film back in 1974 at Filmex. Very avant garde, slice-of-life kind of filmmaking. Not for everyone, but if you love to experience cinema then I wholeheartedly recommend you check this one out. This film is in color by the way, even though Black & white photos are shown."
4,The MUST read....,"If you are a serious investigator into the JFK-assassination this is the book on the history of the Mannlicher-Carcano rifles. In my work with the rifle of Lee Harvey Oswald, I have used this book a lot. My advice; buy it..."
2,Research not well documented,"The lack of footnotes, references, or a bibliography of any sort is a serious flaw in this book. By appearances, a significant amount of research was required to prepare this book, none of which is offered for the reader to corroborate. The author is obviously a proponent of gun control, so much so that, at times, the book seems to be a rant for gun control written under the guise of a history of Mannlicher Carcano C2766, the gun Lee Harvey Oswald used to kill John F Kennedy.Notwithstanding that, there is usefull and interesting information about the rifle, including details of it's trip from Italy to the United States. The reader should be prepared to sort through the author's gun control propaganda to learn the story of C2766."
4,Interesting - but could be more so.,"An interesting book which gives a brief history of the famous insturments made by Stradivari. The book then follows five specific insturments from their creation to present time. The book also gives a good look at the development of the violin, from its inception to its current configuration. Those, like me, who are unfamiliar with this history will find it interesting. I only find two problems with the book. Much of it reads likle an overdone book report from someone who did not enjoy their topic. While there are many interesting tidbits here and there, few of them are developed in a way to make them interesting, and may be missed completely if the reader is not careful. The only other fault I find in the book is that I would have like to have seen photographs of the five insturments in question, and in color. The book of refers to specific details of these insturments, including the color of the varnish used, and photographs would aid the reader greatly."
4,A damn good read.,"While this book falls short of being a masterpiece, it is an enjoyable and engaging story about an unusual character. What it lacks in characterisation, it makes up for in humour, emotion and surprise.It is brilliantly written, and an absolutely worthwhile read."
2,John Irving needs a lesson in how life works,"I'm almost finished with the book and I'm not sure if I am going to finish it. I almost feel cheated because I had heard that it was such a good book. What Irving does is near unforgivable in my book because of the way he casualizes sex. So far Garp has had 9 lovers and fantasies about his son's friend's mother. it made me sick to my stomach and then he was fit to be tied when he found that his wife was cheating on him. maybe I just don't understand the whole ""lust"" thing but I think its sick and twisted"
1,The World According to Whom?,"I apologize to all that adore this book, but the deepest feeling it gave me was one of nausea.This book continues on.. and on.. and on.. (if you don't know what to write about, start at the birth and go to death!) and Irving has such a detailed view of this character named T.S. Garp, but in the making, Irving forgot to endow his wunderkind with something so simple, so necessary... A SOUL.We read about Garp, about his mother, about his life as a child and about his life as an adult. We even read a story he wrote, that goes on for some 30-odd pages. But does this mean anything? Do we understand Garp any more than we did when we first met him, back on page 10?Then, I say, this book is like a Mercedes without gas."
2,Too Many Books....So Little Time....,"I had heard so much positive about this book...that it was on my 'Books to Read Before I Die'...list.Well, I will die with having read 1/2 of it. I kept reading, I guess...because of how great it was supposed to be. I mean...John Irving! I got to the half way point and thought...""Where is this going?!"" I then realized I really didn't care. And put it down. Page after page, I finally came to the realization there wasn't enough of a story/plot to get me to turn another page."
2,'Acording to Garp' fails to please,"When I first opened this book, I expected to find a rich novel full of lessons and all that trash. But, by page 100, I found myself reading anecdotes of perverseness, like in other Irving works such as 'A Widow for One Year'. I think that it is under-estimated and very wrong. It has no good things to get from it. It is only there, for people to read and react. Action. Reaction."
2,Irritating,"More subplots, deus ex machina, and characters whose actions and thoughts defy reason, per-page, than a Tom Robbins novel. Getting the rug pulled out from under you this often is only fun if you're wearing a helmet."
3,"I thought the book was good, but not entirely believable.","I thought that ""The World According to Garp"" was a good novel. However, I thought that parts of it were unbelievable. I thought the characters in particular were a little unbelievable. Also, the numerous amount of accidents that happen to the people within Garp's world just seemed extremely contrived. The book was, however, entertaining. The numerous accidents that occured were so ludicrous that at times they seemed funny. Also, some of the things that the characters did added a touch of comedy to the novel. I liked this book despite it being not entirely believable and would recommend it to others."
4,Listening to Garp is almost as good as reading it.,"John Irving's introduction is wonderful: warm, funny, and his voice is what one would expect Garp's to be.Michael Prichard was a disappointment, initially, after listening to Irving, but he came to be ""the voice"" of Garp. He has slightly different inflections for each voice, without being over-the-top about it. His inflection for Irving's comic asides is sometimes not how I would have emphasized the words; however, that is a matter of personal opinion.Having read Garp almost once a year since the early '80's, I have a feel for some of the major lines. Who could resist reciting from memory along with Prichard Jenny Field's famous line, ""In this dirty-minded world you're either somebody's wife or somebody's whore. Or fast on your way to becoming one or the other.""?Garp rules."
4,Owen Meany is better,"A decent book. Nice and weird, and I like that. But if you want to try Irving, don't start with this, even though it is his most famous book. A Prayer for Owen Meany is a life-changing experience. At the very least, it will give you characters who become part of your life. While Garp was interesting, I wasn't too concerned about what happened to the characters. They didn't come to life like Owen and friends. And if you have read Garp and didn't like it, still try Owen Meany--they are very different books. This review is a plug for another novel--sorry."
4,Enjoyable...,"This book was good, however, Irving has written better things. I started this book with really high expectations having LOVED 'A Prayer For Owen Meany'and been told this was better. I have to disagree. It is definately entertaining but never approaches the heights of bittersweet comedy that Irving reached in 'A Prayer For Owen Meany'. I would recommend reading this book definately, but make some time in you schedule to read Owen Meany as well."
3,He's written better,"Irving's sense of drama and justice is compelling and original. I liked this book, but I definitely didn't think that this was his best book. It started off with a alot of energy and drama, but it just wasn't maintained throughout. The epilogue section was interminable. I thought it would never end."
2,Progressively Degenerative!,"Nope, I do not recommend this book, in an earnest manner. It starts off fine and weaves a story of a unconventional mother Jenny Fields and her son T.S Garp, certain sexual connotations are hilarious and interestingly tittilating, But all this stops after 200 pages. Later the book takes bizzare turns into mindless non-sensical stories written by protagonist Garp, the sexual gore is harped unnecessarily and lot of warped notions are flung at readers, in garb of ""actually-what-we-are"" syndrome.....I don't refute Mr. Irving's notions and his views on this, but I believe he has not been successful in putting across his clarity or confusion of his characters. I did however get some insight into the authors unique way of writing, which has paradoxically has its own appeal. I would recommend this only to folks who are curious to pick up something on John Irving, but not to once-in-a-while reader, for it may be too disappointing."
5,GARP REVIEW,"This book is fantastic. Irving deftly mixes humor with tragedy. His skill in undeniable. It is evident in every sentence. He possesses the ablility to make the reader laugh and cry within the same scene. Superbly written and universally meaningful, you cannot go wrong with The World According to Garp."
3,"a decent read, but doesn't live up to its hype","I read this book all at once, in about eight hours straight- so I figured it at least deserved something for keeping my attention that long. It didn't live up to my expectations, though. I read it based on the glowing reviews, and I was disappointed. I thought a lot of the scenes were overdone and a bit contrived- the accident in the driveway, for example, was a bit much. And for his kid Duncan to lose multiple body parts- enough is enough. And outlining everyone's deaths at the end seemed a bit melodramatic. There was no message to this book either, and nothing it really made me ponder, except maybe the hazards of coasting into your driveway with the lights off. The last line about ""terminal cases"" sounds cool, but it just hangs there, not attached to anything. I thought Garp would be more of a philosopher, or at least more of an interesting weirdo, but he was really just a mediocre writer who got off on adultery and chasing speeding cars."
2,Perfect!... For Inducing Sleep...,"I've never had such a rough time reading anything the way that I had a rough time reading ""The World According to Garp."" It is hundreds of pages of pointless rambling. Irving describes the hell out of EVERYTHING and just goes into way too much detail. And not only that, but its details that are completely unimportant. Reading this book was a pure, brutal struggle and in the end, I realized that there was absolutely no point to it. In the beginning, I thought it had potential, but little did I know that I was beginning one of the most bland books I've ever read. Don't even bother, unless you're an insomniac seeking a good, deep snooze."
3,SEX AND VIOLENCE AND VIOLENT SEX,"Irving's idea of a plot is to throw in the most bizarre event anyone can imagine and then have his characters suffer the consequences. A few parts I had to laugh out loud at and others I did cringe at.It started off with a lot of energy and drama, but it just wasn't maintained throughout. I found the storyline in parts timeless.I didn't say I didn't like this book - I was relieved when it was over. The story was 20hrs and 26min long on audible. If it be abridged to 12 hours and cut out some of the slow parts I could have given it a 5 star. But it dragged on so long with too many boring bits. Now don't get me wrong I have listened to longer stories and didn't want them to end. But this story, please put out an abridged version and it would be a lot better.(For me to say this!!! I am normally someone who always buys unabridged!!!!!)"
5,Give Credit Where Credit Is Due,"It disturbs me to read some of the reviews I have read about Mr.Irvings incredibly written novels. To say that John Irving is an untalented writer, I would consider to be blasphemy. Maybe some of his characters can be unrealistic at times, but if you want everything to be just like real life then why are you looking in the fiction section? Anyone who can honestly call any of John Irving's characters ""hollow"" must have a small, gray stone in place of a heart. He has some of the most touching, heartbreaking characters I have ever come upon. Garp strikes an amazingly true chord in the heart of so many of its readers that to call Irving untalented would be equivalent to saying that the ceiling of the Sistine chapel is ugly. Take the time to read Irving, he will make it worth your while."
2,not what I expected,"While everyone raves about this book, I found it boring and depressing and couldn't finish it. I bought it to read because the author is coming to town to speak. I got bogged down by Garp's immorality and lust as well as the obscene language. The ""novels within the novel"" were irrelevent and disjointed. I did, however, enjoy the humor within the pathos. I was very disappointed."
2,A rare literary event in my reading life,"I have read hundreds of classics and many contemporary writers, and I consider that I have ""literary"" tastes, although I enjoy a good Stephen King novel or even trashy thrillers. And authors that fall between, such as John Updike and Joyce Carol Oates. But, I don't get John Irving. TWATG was the only book I have ever read that I didn't finish after having completed virtually all of it. I literally had only a few pages to go, but I was beyond caring. I've really tried to find something to like about this author--but Irving's style (if you could call it that), his attention to odd, irrelevant detail, and his mannikin-like characters leave me cold."
3,Unique read,"I just finished this as part of a book club I belong to. Our meeting is Wednesday, but I'm still trying to piece together my thoughts on this multifaceted book. At times it is jarring, it is shocking, and it is beautiful. The tales of a person's life from conception on provide a unique view of a life through the lens of various friends and family members. The book takes us through Europe, America, and the world of publishing and nursing. If you do not want to be shocked, don't read this. If you like a strong dose of reality and honesty coupled with (mainly) very likable characters, than this is for you."
5,Awesome!,"This has got to be, by far, the best book I've ever read. I was 17 the 1st time I read it. I found it laying around my parents house and, out of boredom, picked it up and started reading. Up to that point, I had never been one to like reading. ""I'll wait for the movie"" was my motto. I got the suprise of my life. It was the 1st book that ever made me laugh out loud and it was the 1st book that ever made me cry. John Irving certainly has a knack for conveying all emotions. I've been a book lover ever since, and yes...I have read all of John Irving's books."
5,A turning point in my life as a reader and an artist,"At nineteen, at the beginning of the first serious relationship of my young life, I stumbled across Irving's novel. This was 1983, long after the hype and a year or so after the movie. I was so moved by the characters, the scenarios, the undercurrent of young lust that undercut many of Garp's best intentions, and particularly by the fierce, bearish devotion he had for his loved ones. Fourteen years of marriage left, I still doggedly avoid the undertoad, knowing all too well that we're all terminal cases..."
5,I couldn't put it down!!!!,I loved this book. Maybe it was how Garp seemed so lifelike and his problems developed as everyone's does. Each character had their own problems and his life taught so many lessons. Highly recommended.
5,It WILL change the way you view life,"S*** HAPPENS. You probably thought this term originated in bootleg Calvin-and-Hobbes T-Shirts. NOT SO, My friend! It was John Irving's thesis in writing Garp. If you saw the Robin Williams film, I URGE you to now read the book. There are so many more crazy things in the book, such as ""Mrs Ralph."" I re-read this book whenever I am uncertain about life. It gives me a grin not unlike that on Robin Williams' face as he whined, ""I'm flying."" Truly inspirational, and wickedly funny, this book should be remembered as one of our times' best books."
4,Get to know Garp,"Although I agree that PARTS of this book were depressing, it also had its light moments and its humorous moments. Garp is an unusal character, from conception to death. I could not put this book down, and I would recommend it to everyone. I think most people would want to know a character like Garp."
3,OK but not great,"Garp had its funny moments and its sad moments and its riveting moments, but throughout the novel I could never make any personal connection with TS Garp himself. Most of what happened to him seemed to be his own fault, but he himself could never see that. And I didn't quite understand why the feminists hated him so, other than simple and largely accidental mistakes, which then grew into their perception of him. I almost saw the climactic accident which killed Walt as just desserts for his myopic and entirely one-sided obsession not only with his wifes affair but his own inability as an author. The novel has left me, however, with a thirst to see the movie and to see how well Robin Williams can recreate the shallowness and boredom of TS Garp."
5,Great Plot,"This book has a complex, interesting plot, easy to read, great book and highly recommended."
1,Quite possibly the most depressing book I've ever read.,"When I was reading this book, I found myself actively seeking other pastimes when I would normally be reading. I was 2/3 of the way through when I realized I was doing everything in my power to avoid continuing it, and quit reading it at that time. The first chapter promised a Catch-22-like festival of insanity, but after that the story sunk into a mind-numbing pathos devoid of all hope and amusing to only the most avid sado-masochists. Stay away froim this one!"
4,good stuff,"I really enjoyed ""The World According to Garp"".Some of the parts were a bit drawn out, like for example, the ending. I didn't care for Garp's writings.....those were boring.Other than that, good story with interesting characters."
2,Another male-chauvinist masquerading as sympathetic,"Come on. Garp can fool around with college-age babysitters and Alice, but when Helen has an affair, she looses Walt and Duncan looses his eye.That was almost enough to make me burn this book.I have to admit I'm getting quite tired (after four Irving books) of the repeated themes...male obsession with sex, private boys schools, Viennese prostitutes, and flat female characters. For someone who's so popular, you'd think he could tell an original story once in a while.Don't waste your time."
4,"Thick . .but yes, it is certainly entertaining!","I will be the first to admit that this rather thick read was intimidating and hard to commit to in the first couple of chapters. But the humor is there. Garp says what everyone thinks but never really says. Anything by Irving (in my opinion) is by far and away the easiest read. I read this one on the morning commute and was able to fly right through it. I will admit though. . .this is for the mature reader. I don't think that I would have found it as humorous at a young age. Thus, the reason I think so many students bash it."
5,Surreal end Extraordinary,"A warning to readers of ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"": Throw out your expectations of John Irving. APFOW was a spectacular book, but very different from this one.A warning to more sensitive readers: Just because an author depicts disgusting or un-Christian behavior does not make him an advocate of it. Authors are both observers and commentators. Read the commentary as much as the events.That said, I have to comment myself that this is one of the finest books I have ever read. I believe that John Irving is one of the writers of the twentieth century who will be remembered long into the next one. His characters are bizzare to say the least, but he makes them real to us and never trivializes any of them. Irving has a wonderful sense of the comically tragic, as well as a unique perception of human fallibility. In the novel according to Irving, we are all terminal cases."
2,Sad and contradictory,"It is a very sad and contradictory book, for example Garp doesn't let the drivers go fast in his living address for the safety of his kids, but when he is coming home, before he arrives turns off the car lights and keeps driving killing one of his children, this is safe? let's ask to his son.The writer writes and writes until everybody is dead some by the age and some by an accident."
2,What was the point?,"This book was entirely divorced from anything I could relate to. It just seemed not surreal enough to be ""trippy"" and too unreal for me to get involved in the story.Was the self-mutuilation of the Ellen Jamesians symbolic? What was that supposed to be I had no idea. All of the relations described in the book seemed contrived and just plain weird.Only for very few of the characters did I even feel a slight interest in, but they tended only to be tangential to the story.All in all this book is an absurdist account of the gender wars. It is not so absurd to be entertaining, but too absurd to be involving.My motivation for purchasing this book was because so many reviewers thought that this book was hillarious. Well, if this was hillarious, how would you describe Douglas Adams? This book was about as funny as gangrene."
1,I HATE this book...and I never hate books.,"I HATED this book. I wanted to scrub my mind after reading it. This wasn't a narrative...the only conflict to be faced by the main character (i.e. plot) was life itself. Irving was not satisfied with following around the title character for his entire life from birth to death; he also stalked the character's children and reported on their odd and early demise to make sure that every person in the story you had ever known was in their graves by the end. Yes,that too is true to life itself, but I don't need that in a book--I can see that in my own reality. Why would I want to subject myself to a depressing fictitious depiction of this? Ugh!"
1,1 Star rating is too much for this book.,"A bad book by an untalented author. GARP/s efforts to become an established writer and his eagerness to be accepted as a good author represents, in my opinion, the author/s own insecurity about his poor penmanship."
4,"Sarcastic, yet humorous","The World According to Garp is a novel that makes you think about the reality of parents' fears. Fears for their children and fears in the world around them. Garp wants nothing more than to keep his children safe and secure form harms way much like Jenny wanted for her son Garp. Both of these characters have a hard time excepting the reality that no matter how much control they exercise they can't protect their loved ones forever, they can't even protect themselves."
3,No masterpiece,"Garp is a good read, but no masterpiece. Some of the storytelling is good, and then suddenly the irony becomes so forced it's almost unbearable. But the book does posit many interesting theories about writers and writing, which makes it more than worthwhile. Some characters are wonderfully well developed, others are flat. Some concepts are rich, others (the ""Under Toad?"" Please.) are forced. But overall, a good book. Not as good as Cider House Rules, but will definitely keep me coming back for more Irving."
4,A Delightful and Outrageous Book,"`The World According to Garp' is a very colorful book. The character Garp is a unique and passionate individual. John Irving paints a picture of a man whose life is both strewn with outrageous occurances and surrounded by an assortment of unusual characters throughout. Always a mavrick to the norm, Garp makes his world one of extraordinary excitement and heartbreak. I found myself laughing at times at the originality and absurdity, as well as being touched by the sadness of all the tragic experiences therein. Irving takes you through four generations surrounding the astonishing character T.S.Garp, and across two continents. It is a world of humor, tragedy, joy and realism. How one feels about this entire novel is quite difficult to express in words, but it essentially is a delightful story all in all."
5,Great seller!,"Took a little while to ship, but when I got it, it was in better condition than advertised, and the dust jacket even came in plastic. Thanks!- J"
5,One of my all-time favorites....,"I forewarn everyone who picks up this book; you will forget the rest of the world exists once you start. This is the kind of book you read once, astonished that someone would even attempt at writing such a remarkable, startling, beautiful novel, and then go back to read it again and again each time finding something else to cherish and ponder. ""The World According to Garp"" is a book about love and fear, life and death. It is a work where we find our own faults and insecurities reflected in the characters. For anyone who wants to experience an amazing writer at the top of his craft, pick up this book."
2,None,"after reading and adoring A Prayer For Owen Meany, I had very high hopes for this novel. As much as I enjoy Irving`s uniquely odd storytelling approach, I found tis novel to be a bit too weird and all over the place for me. I doubt I will read it again but I am glad to have read and experienced it. I am currently reading The Cider House Rules and loving it."
3,"Well written, but couldn't make a connection...","The story - I just didn't enjoy it. John Irving is a fine writer, and I am not knocking his abilities.Some people enjoy a particular story, others do not. I just didn't fine Garp all that interesting. I thought the beginning of the book was the strongest. But I didn't think this book was ""hilarious"" or exceedingly funny. Irving CAN be extremely funny - almost as funny as Vonnegut, but he just didn't do it for me here."
5,About time this movie gets on DVD,"This is one of my favorite movies and I am so glad that it is finally on DVD.The great thing about this movie is the fact that it is fun, has good acting, and a good story, and makes you look past all the bad parts, which are not many. The affects are what could hurt this movie to a new generation of fans, those who grew up on computers and non stop action. Even as a fan, the buffalo looks, well it was what it was. But the actors did a very good job playing these characters, and help bring you in to that world.The DVD could have been done better, I would have like to see some extras, or even a title menu, but alas there is none. Of course I can understand why not, this film is a cult classic at best, and MGM would have trouble making money with a special addition double disc.In the end I am glad this movie finally made it DVD."
2,A very poor western,"I can't believe my eyes when I saw the stars this film got. Bronson is not a good actor, and Lee Thompson is a not a good director. Even the white buffalo was a fake. There are acouple of years I saw it, but I was very disappointed when I left the theater. If this film gets five points it must be as good as High Noon, Shane or Warlock or the John Ford films. It is actually a below average western."
3,The westerns were changing.....,"The White Buffalo tries to be surrealistic as Charles Bronson portrays Wild Bill Hickock plagued by nightmares hunting for a rare white buffalo. Interesting movie, but sometimes slow paced. the time of grand westerns had passed by the time this movie was filmed. Writers and directors were looking for something different from the ""oaters"". Good cast helps save this movie. Clint Walker plays a real nasty."
2,Too much,"I found this movie confusing. It seemed to wander in and out of fantasy and symbolism, without ever making clear what it was all about. I assume it had a point to make, but I never figured it out."
4,"""jaws"" on the western plains","this is another of charles bronson's 70's westerns that tried to do something different,and it works if you let it. blasted by everyone when it came out it really is a good take on ""jaws"" and ""moby dick"" in the west. bronson is wild bill hickock,slowly being eatten away by the clap,and having visions of the white buffalo of the title and it's coming for him so he starts looking for it. will sampson is crazy horse who must kill the beast to help his daughter(killed by the anamial)to get to heaven. this has some great scenery and some fine action scenes,so if you like bronson or westerns that have a little food for thought check this one out."
2,Moby Dick Meets The Wild West,"and a worse retelling of it I can't recall.But it's so bad it's fun.The cast alone is worth the viewing.An especially good turn is Hickcock telling Crazy Horse how the Indians have bullied each other across the plains (and the did), and now they've met a bigger bully so deal with it."
2,The White Buffalo Review,"The premise story line was very difficult to accept and at times understand. The scenery was terrific, i.e. the buffalo bone yard, country/mountain views, train, stage coach shots great. I would not have bought this movie if I had known the story line before hand."
4,Whie Buff,I would have to say I'm very pleased with this product and the shipping was good as usual with Amazon.com . The video on this dvd release of White Buffalo is of excellent quality and sound quality was good as well. The acting and the plot were great in this film plus the White Buffalo was cool in this movie. The aspect ratio is 1:85 on this release of the film. Overall best Charles Bronson film ever made in my book I would highly recommned this dvd .
5,Made me go back on the road,"i used to race superbikes... once, i got a puncture, and got flat...i was pretty worried 'cause i was far away from home... one of the guys walked towards me smiling.. and told me.. well dude.. get ready to stay here for a couple of hours... and i was like,,, ""why the ... is he smiling""... and then told me that he was joking and told me that he got one of this kits... and repaired the tire in a few minutes.. then i went to a gas station... refilled the tire.. and the trip continued...i had not used yet the one that i just bought but i have it on the mini-trunk of the bike... and i know that it works.....highly recommended..."
1,very poor quality tool,Broke the first time I used it. The screw cap that holds the plug tools in is made from a relatively soft metal and with very poor tolerances. The plug tools pull right through the metal cap and out of the T handle. I wound up using a pair of vice grip pliers instead of the T handle to finish my single repair. It's a fundamentally flawed product.
2,Slime 22038 Deluxe Reamer Plugger Kit with Storage Handle,"Not everything fits into the handle, like it leads you to believe. You end up needing to store it in something anyway, if you want all the ""stuff."""
2,Not so hot,Got this for my wife to fix roadside flats. She had one in the driveway and cold not get any tool through the nail hole.
1,Junk,Plugged the unit into my motorcycle battery to test it. It worked for almost 1 second before it quit and never worked again. Worthless piece of junk. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Poor quality - one use and then broken,"As other comments indicate there are additional pieces with no explanation on what they are for. The tips are larger than need be and it makes the repair difficult but not impossible.The main flaw with this kit is the brass screw/cap on the t-handle that secures the tip. The hole is over-sized and very thin/flimsy brass. After inserting the plug, the tip pulled out of the handle (through the brass cap) when trying to remove it. I got the tire repaired, but won't be able to use it again."
3,Tubeless Repair,"It's a compact unit but the tools are to long for the lid to shut properly so I ground off about a 1/16th inch, it will make a nice tire repair for my motorcycle."
4,Overall Great Product,"Overall, the Slime 22038 Compact Tire Plug Kit is a great product. I have not had to plug a tire before and was a bit skeptical given the disclaimers that the plug would only be a temporary solution; however, I took a shot at the low risk investment (below $20) for a potential solution that would pay for itself immediately if it worked - I had 2 tires with slow leaks.On the downside, the amount of glue will not be enough for all of the plugs that were sent.On the upside:The instructions were intuitive; The different steel components of the tool are of high quality; the plugs are of high quality; the bonus sharp blade made cutting the excessive plug very easy; and all of the components fit into the handle - it is very compact and stores easily.I plugged the two tires and both have held the pressure for several thousand miles. I have high hopes that they will be a permanent solution for the life of the tires."
4,"Great design, pays for itself immediately","I got this based on the reviews here - glad I chose this one. I quickly repaired my wheelbarrow tire for a fraction of the price of a new solid tire, and keep the pneumatic ride. Plus I've got four more plugs, and everything I'll need for another repair fits within the sturdy handle."
2,Too many cut corners,"Why make a product like this that's just kind of so-so? For 10% more effort they could have made it 50% better.-the instructions don't explain why there are three different devices to thread the sticky stuff into the tire.-the sticky plugs don't fit in the handle! Make them half an inch shorter, or make the handle half an inch longer. Easy!-the kit includes rubber cement. For...? No explanation at all.-the capper on the handle to hold all the stuff is this spring loaded swing out thing that doesn't stay closed. Just make it a simple pop-in cap.-I bought two, for different vehicles, and one of them came without the rasper tool.Most of it is silly stuff, but why not just make better stuff?"
5,"Excellent, compact, and easy to use.","I'm very pleased with this for motorcycle use.A backup that I hope never to need, for a reasonable price.Edit: I repaired a visitors car tire. Quick (5 minutes), easy, and effective."
4,Good product.,I haven't used it to plug a tire yet but the product seems to be well made. I like that all the tools fit in the handle. Makes for easy storeage under a motorcycle seat. I would recommend to a friend.
3,Suddenly the world grows a whole lot smaller.....,"I seem to like this sequel more than Honey, I Shrunk The Kids mainly because this is one of the movies that I grew up watching it. It's true that Honey, I Blew Up The Kid doesn't really hold up eighteen years later, but there are still some pretty good things about it. The story is just as weak as the one in the original, but at least the special effects are pretty fun to watch. There are some fun and silly scenes, as well as a pretty wacky music score by Bruce Broughton. The things I disliked the most about this movie were the lame one-liners said by Keri Russell, the cardboard cutout villain played by John Shea, and, as I mentioned before, the story which isn't really much to start with. In the end, I consider Honey, I Blew Up The Kid a bit of a guilty pleasure. The film beings a lot of nostalgia: I liked it back when I was a kid, and I still like it now (at least SOME of it).Grade: 6/10"
4,"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid","The only sequel better than the original. Rick Moranis stars as an eccentric inventor. He accidentally zaps Adam, his two-year-old, with a machine designed to enlarge things. Adam grows to over 100 feet tall. We are reminded of The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, although Adam is a little kid and means no harm. He is cute in his red overalls. He terrorizes Las Vegas. He reminded me of my own kid, especially when he went for the Hard Rock Cafe guitar. The terrible twos take on a new meaning. Keri Russell is the baby sitter whom Adam's brother ties up. She grew up and went on to star in the delightful Waitress."
3,hilarious!!!,"A reader from USA ELLENVILLE NY, 12428HILARIOUS!!!!!!!! FUNNY!!!!!!! TOUCHING!!!!!intersting story this story is making things biger or smaller. But if you don't know what the H-e-c-k you are doning don't go making your son as big as a skycraper.Nicholas Searles"
2,Oh c'mon!,"How could anyone like this obnoxious and boring sequel to ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids?."" This movie was bores throughout and just sort of weird. The original was good, and so was the third, but this series could have done better without this one. I like Rick Moranis, but I would have to say this is one of the worst movies he has ever performed in."
4,Timeless fun!,A good sequel and still a classic. Enjoyed it all over again with my 8 yr old - who loved it.
4,Family movie night winner,Great movie for a family movie night with an 8 year old boy and 5 year old girl! Oldie but goodie.
5,my favorite one in the series,this is a must have for everybody. children and adults with an imagination. buy this you'll enjoy it. i still have a copy recorded 2 vhs my mom made me a long time ago. classic film
4,Deja Vu,"This is a great movie for kids. I know because once my 3 year old saw it, we didn't stop watching it the whole week. I think to date we have watched it at least 10 times. So, if you want your small children to be entertained...rent or better yet, buy this one. As an adult you may get tired of watching it but you can catch up on that rather much needed rest while the movie is on. Two enthusiastic thumbs up."
4,"Very effective fan, not so quiet...","This fan was purchased to replace a basic ventilation fan in our bath. We wanted at least 100 cfm to remove the most moisture as possible from a large bath area, and it is doing a great job so far. It was relatively easy to install, but a regular-sized light bulb seemed to be almost too large to fit in the housing.And, it is not a quiet fan. It is definitely loud, but it's effectiveness in venting moisture from the bath area outweighs this drawback.I would recommend this fan to anyone who wants good ventilation with a light and is not as concerned with fan noise."
3,"Good concept, good acting but, poor film.","This film could have been so much more than what it was. Though the acting was surprisingly good, it was way too slow for my tastes. The acting is why this movie got a 3 and not a 1...glad I rented instead of buying it.Major props to the young actors."
2,save your money..,"Save your money on this one. Most of the licks here are your basic bar, guitar 101 level breathen. ie. If you can figure out Smoke on the Water, you can figure out these songs on your own.Worth noting, are the Stone Temple Pilots and Smashing Pumpkin's tunes.Try the Hendrix video."
3,Very Interresing,I love anything by RSJ because of her ability to go staight to the point. This is her first CD and all I can say is that she sure sounds better than all those dippy wonnabe pop singers today.Onya RSJ.
5,"Great quality and a great price, well worth it!","I absolutely love this playard! We actually bought this playard and another playard (Fisher Price playard, Jungle Theme) and there was no comparison. We bought this playard to be used at my son's daycare, and I love the quality craftmanship. It was very easy to put together and the instructions were easy to follow.My son has a hard time falling asleep by himself and I bought this playard especially for the vibration feature. I am very impressed. The other playard was cute, but not as durable and not as many features."
1,Don't buy this,"This product was great after we managed to get it put together and it stayed together for the first two months but after that when we have used it, the sides don't stay up, it is difficult to fold up and within the first 6 months it has cracked and the side release buttons have broken. Combi customer service has been difficult and said they would replace it and then have denied saying they would replace it. I will not purchase Combi products again."
5,Excellent product,Wow! Great product for a great price and fast delivery - can't beat that trifecta.
4,I hear good things,"The family I gave it to love it, apparently it's perfect for semi-travel, it's sturdy and easy to set up but heavy, so perfect if they're going to they're folks for a while"
5,A towering achievement,"In stirring prose McPhee turns the imperceptible pace of geological change exposed in High Plains road cuts into sublime and awesome cataclysms. He incorporates the struggle to survive and prosper of a pioneering ranch family, from whom came an outstanding geologist, John Love. He deciphers the complex story lying behind modern Wyoming, including the soaring Teton Range, evocative Wind River, and Yellowstone. Far more than a guide (with it's helpful time charts and map), McPhee's sensitive writing makes you feel the prodigious forces of the landscape lurking underfoot--almost as unsettling as experiencing an earthquake yourself.A fun complement to this book is the Wyoming oil geologist mystery Tensleep by Sarah Andrews, or Margaret Coel's Arapaho mystery series."
5,Another great book from a great writer,"Well this is another of McPhee's books on geology and as usual it is very well done. But don't let that fool you, even though this book is written about high-country geology it is not too heavily laden with technical jargon nor is it a tedious read. With sly humor and and a witty style the author brings a down to earth (forgive the pun) approach and brings to life the richness of human history and geology in the old west till the present day.If you are a student of geology then this is a must read along with McPhee's other books on geology...Basin and Range and In Suspect Terrain...but even if you are not interested in the geological processes of the west the book still brings to life the people and country of Wyoming and the old west. Overall this is a great book and while some people may find it tedious if you have a love for the outdoors and the frontiers then this book will definately impart some knowledge unto you and is worth reading."
5,Classic McPhee - a mix of history and Wyoming geology.,"John McPhee tells two stories in one: the geology of Wyoming, and the family and personal history of David Love. Love is a native of Wyoming who left for a Ph.D. in geology at Yale, and later returned as the supervisor of the Laramie branch of the U.S. Geological Survey. Love drives, talks, and points; McPhee records.We learn that Wyoming has a freeway outcrop showing rock formed over a spread of over two billion years, from Precambrian granite to recent sedimentary rock - the largest time span of any freeway outcrop on Interstate 80. Love's mini-lectures on Wyoming geology are interwoven with the story of his ranch, settled by his family near the turn of the century.This is classic McPhee - clear, understandable non-fiction animated by narrative. Recommended."
5,"Good, but there are better","Brandwith is a cute name for Internet marketing, and the author's lay out the case for pushing sales pretty well. But speaking from a small business/entrepreneurial viewpoint, I found not very much practical information that I could put to good use. If you want a better alternative, try ""The Anatomy of Buzz"" by Emanuel Rosen. Some very practical stuff that the upstart e-marketer can really use."
3,Count Online Success in Sales Dollars--Nothing Else,"I'm glad I listened to the three-hour abridged tape set while driving in the car, rather then spend even more time focused on reading the book.There's not much new material here, but the main point of Brandwidth: Closing the Sale Online is earthshaking! When counting online success, only dollars count--not hits, visits, looky-lous--just sales revenue.For that point alone and all the supporting information, listening to this abridgement was worth my time."
2,What a disappointment!,"I loved Zyman's earlier book, so I expected more of the same. But not until page 82 did I encounter a single fresh idea or interesting example. This reads like the outline for a book that was slapped together. It's not that the advice is wrong. It's good advice, but there is no depth and no originality to it, and very little worthwhile content."
2,Read his first book,Reads like a sequel to a blockbuster movie. Does not quite live up to expectations.
4,Jim Cole at his best,"Listen carefully - it's not James Taylor. But Jim Cole sounds a lot like him. A nice collection of tunes from his first three albums. Songs are:Every Generation, Humble Yourself as a Child, Sweet Gospel Music, Merciful God, Leap of Faith, Shephered of All Who Wander, You Rescue Me, Light of the World, Remedy for This, There is a Love, Railroad Bill"
5,A Knock Out,"The best novel on boxing ever. I haven't read them all, but I've read a bunch. I think the authors of nonfiction books on boxing would agree, too. Because typically, it's the really gifted and obsessed writers who are drawn to write about the fistic world. The Bruiser is a noir classic. Anyone who likes tough guy crime novels, going back to Chandler, Hammett, Goodis and the other masters should love this book. It's a great chronicle of America in the 1920s-30s, hoboing, fighting, living on the edge. It's so good you'll want to read it twice. Jim Tully is my hero."
2,"A lot of talent, not much content","Toni Tennille could have and should have done better. This CD is my least favorite of her four solo CD's. There are good moments like ""I Wish I Were In Love Again"", Hard Hearted Hannah"" but mostly it is a second rate attempt to sale CD's. Ms Tennille's deep throaty voice doesn't lend itself to swing, she needs to stay will Ballads. This CD doen't demonstrate much of her style as her previous 3 CD's did. She is capable of much better."
5,TONI SWINGS,"WE'VE ALL HEARD THE CAPTAIN AND TENNILLE SING ON TV IN THE 70'S OR 80'S. DIDN'T LISTEN TO ALL THAT ""POP"" STUFF THEY DID. BUT MAN, WHAT A SURPRISE THIS GAL DID ON THIS ALBUM. TONI CAN SWING WITH THE BEST OF THE BIG BAND SINGERS. ALSO, HAVING MATT CATINGUB'S BIG BAND BEHIND YOU AND HAVING HIS ARRANGEMENTS SURE DOESN'T HURT EITHER. MATT IS ANOTHER STORY IN ITSELF. THIS ENTIRE ALBUM REALLY COOKS.BUCK"
3,Longing for A Great Tennille Album,"Having heard and video taped Toni Tennille when she appeared on ETV, it makes me long for an album where she sings and the band plays as great as they did on this ETV Program. I've played this tape repeatedly--including twice today. On the ETV program, she sang ""You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby,"" ""Sentimental Journey"", ""It Had To Be You"" with Hal Lindon, ""Moonglow"". None of her CD's (I have two of them before this one)comes close to her ETV performance. And that is a shame because she has a great voice and a great feel for the music of the 40's. I think the choice of tunes made for all of her CD's is where the problem lies. I'd like an album of hers where she does only the most popular standards of the 40's, such as those on the ETV program. So I am disappointed in this album."
1,toni stings big bands...,"toni only hurts these great swing arrangemnents with her powerfu lsting of a singing voice, bad vocals..."
2,big band and toni don't mix like a cocktail,"a good cocktai lshould have ingredients that mnix. So I gave thsi cd two stars, only because the band is exellent. Tony gets no stars for her lack of singing or swinging. She just doesn't have the swagger or enthusiasm, or swing to pull this off, and since she hired a good jazz band, it just makes her look more unprofessional. Not that she isn't a pro , but she should stick to pop music where it really doesn't matter if you have actual skills and talents."
2,Samuel - a favorite,Samuel is an excellent example for the present generation in faithfulness. Not as well written as I expected but a still a good read.
4,The impound saver,"We purchase our sawzall about a year ago, thinking that maybe this would help, WOW what a lifesaver it has been. Thank you Milwaukie for this product...."
1,Not a reference!,"As a practising engineer, I have a strong background in mathematics and programming. I have none in MATLAB. I found that the book had serious flaws, the least of which is a decent index (how can a book claim to be a reference with such a weak index!). I had to rely on other books to give me the introduction to MATLAB that I needed. This book made it hard to find the ""how to"" type information that most beginners/intermediates need.Its OK for experienced users who already know what function calls they're supposed to be using."
3,More like an introduction to Matlab,"As a newcomer to Matlab, I bought the book in hopes it would speed up my learning curve. I found it useful as an introduction; but the book is hardly comprenhensive either as a reference or a tutorial as the title would suggest. When it came to actually doing something useful, like a loop that decments or producing axis scales for an image, I found the standard Matlab documentation much more helpful. Lack of a syntax specification for functions make the book of questional value as a ""reference"". Buy this book only if need an introduction to Matlab; and, are willing to pay top dollar"
1,It is anything BUT comprehensive,"On first need for help, trying to learn algebraic manipulation/syntax of Matlab, the Contents and the Index are totally devoid of anything relating to this subject.Nor did a painfull search through the book indicate that there is any information on this subject. e.g., try to find: Algebra Solve Simultaneous Equation or any other related topic. FORGET IT"
2,A Bad Book for Novices,"""Mastering Matlab 5"" may be a useful book for users with matlab experience, but for the user with limited or no programming experience this book fails as a tutorial. The function definitions are often vague or too technical, and the limited examples do not always help with clarification. The style and format of the book resembles the manual that comes prepackaged with the matlab software."
4,Good Reference - No proofreading,"This book is severely lacking proof reading, there are many typographical mistakes. The historical background provided is excellent, unfortunately there is very little TOE information and the OOB info is difficult to follow. I know of no better source of information on Hungary for World War II but this book seriously needs proof reading and re-publishing. It would also be very valuable if some detailed TOE and OOB information was provided and better organized."
1,This item is not for Motorola V300,"This battery door does NOT fit my cell phone, Motorola V300. It's not in blue color either. No picture and wrong description! It doesn't deserve even 1 star."
2,Very small images,"Although colorful, I found a lot of these images to be really tiny, far too small for what I want to use them for. Also, quite a lot of them are of a poor quality, very fuzzy and poorly isolated from the source."
3,"Sweet, tragic, gritty","Aside from the fact there's TOO MUCH SMOKING, and the lead characters could have been prettier, this was a well done movie with a little of everything: love, angst, humor, loss, tragedy, betrayal. If you're not fond of gay love, don't watch it. Otherwise, it's worth a look."
4,GREAT acting,"Have to say the best thing about this movie was the acting, hands down. The movie (and I guess the novel it was based on?) knows its focus, so we get a tender story about love and timing. The story's not perfect- there's a want of more characterization for supporting roles, more insight into Lan Yu's family situation, Chen's friends' lives and more info on the big time-gaps that are left, but big as those faults sound on paper you still don't really care. The story knows what it's about, and the actors give great convincing performances. definitely a tear jerker. as an American viewer i guess I also found interesting how the film used life in the States and possibility there as a plot device, so that we get the American dream and its forms showing up in Beijing during a time of economic transformation to inform the plot from a few different angles. anyway i'm glad i watched it."
2,Ehh...,"I read many reviews saying this was one of the best gay love stories ever. great gay movies are extreemly hard to come by. most are d-movies with horible acting and silly plots and bad filming. i was told by many that this one was ""different"" its ""fantastic"". I didnt really like it. It hardly could keep my attenchion for 5 minutes. I didnt care if they stayed together at all. break up? make up? be together forever? more like whatever...will true love conquer all? maybe in a better movie..."
4,Fast delivery,"My granddaughter needed this book for a class, and being able to find and order it saved a lot of running all over!"
5,A fascinating and odd book:,"Ishmael is a teacher; actually he is a sentient simian with a final mission to teach man to fix the ills of the modern world (which are really due to man). The title presents new precepts in a very engaging and generally upbeat, if some what Pollyanna manner. It is a story of how we got to this place and a choice of whether to continue on this road of destruction, or to reverse course and how we might actually go about this.This title may well become the Teachings of Don Juan for the 00s (modern generation's), it aspires to give meaning and direction to the confused and dejected youth of today, without actually encouraging them to join a cult.I really liked it."
3,"OK, didnt change my life or say really anything new.","This book was just OK for me. I think the author assumed an awful lot about human kind, almost to the point where it offended me. Honestly, I've never believed this world was made for man or that the ""creation myth"" ends with us. Come on, now. I can see though, if the country was enlightened by ""The Da Vinci Code"", they'd be enlightened by this too."
5,a must-read,"by far, the most important words i have ever read; what's more, i haven't heard less fiery testimony from any i've convinced to read it.you must give quinn a chance."
5,Ishmael is a fantastic book,"Do you know there's a lot of things you know about life, that you feel about what's going on in the world... you just know something about it isn't quite right, but you just can't put your finger on it?If that describes you, then this book should definitely be on your shelf. It's an easy read and it lays some groundwork for some powerful introspection.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
4,Thought provoking and sad.,A really interesting approach to the serious issues that we face in today's world. I loved it! I want to read more of Daniel Quinn's writing.
4,Thought Provoking,"Unexpected and enlightening! At times a little difficult to follow in the back and forth exchange, but easily remedied. It kept my attention to the end."
4,Thought provoking,"A thought-provoking read. Actually, I'm not sure that's accurate. I think it's more of a perspective-shifting read.The writing isn't the best, but the message is far too important to quibble over talent, in my opinion. Everyone should read this book, even if you end up disagreeing with it.Also, I do recommend My Ishmael as well, but The Story Of B was just overkill for me."
3,Handel's Review,"Ishmael is a book based on ideas for people who are looking for an adventure of the mind and spirit. It has many different themes that challenge many things human animals do today. ""Man was made to turn the world into a paradise, but tragically he was born flawed. And so his paradise has always been spoiled by stupidity, greed, destructiveness, and shortsightedness."" A very important quote to me because I believe that we were made to make this world a paradise for everyone, but many people are shortsighted and greedy so they do things that will benefit them only and leave the problems that will incur from what they are doing to their own kin to solve when they pass on. The narrator in this book is not described as a man woman or given a name I believe so that its ideas wont be reached by just one group of people because the world is everyone's and we all can benefit from the ideas of this book, so if you have a earnest desire to save the world read this book."
5,Brilliant!,A remarkable work of startling clarity and depth. Ishmael dares to reveal another perspective of human history other than the arrogant and anthropocentric one drilled into our brains from birth. Ishmael's message is inescapable.
3,"The book, was interesting, but more less it was confusing...","This book was okay in the beggining but in the end, the book began to get very,very confusing, I am only going to be a freshmen this year and we we're assasigned to read this book.. I see no reason for the GORILLA to die. It really ended like a cliff hanger, you are pretty much suppose to guess how the book ended..... I really would not recomend this book to anyone who doesn't have patience........................"
1,What was Quinn thinking?,"Or WAS he?!? I had to read the sequal to this book for a class last semester, however, it was very thought provoking. . . i.e. I never thought it was going to end.The Prof. was pitched the class at the last minute and this was on the agenda. Luckily, she finished before we did and was so unimpressed that we didn't even have to take the test!This book is to positive solutions as twinkies are to bicycle repair. If you really want to feel ecologically progressive, buy a book on solar power! Take a walk! Plant a tree! Just don't sit on your butt wasting time on this book when you could be DOING something about the problem!!!"
1,Not my type of reading material,"I can't remember exactly why I wasn't too fond of this book - I think it was a bit repetitious. I read it because it was on my granddaughter's Grade 9 reading list, & I guess I am well past that level. It didn't stick with me & I would have to go back to it to be more exact as to why I didn't like it."
3,Ismael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit,"It was an okay book. It was interesting to think about an animal teaching a human. However, I think that the title ""an adventure of the mind and spirit"" is very misleading. While it was an interesting proposition to think about; I don't think it was anything I had not thought about before. Therefore, it was not an adventure at all."
5,Among Good Books...,"Just beginning to read Ishmael, I thought, 'this may be the most important book written in the last, oh, 3 million years.' The longer I think about it, the surer I am."
5,The Truth - Hard for very few to accept.,"Please notice the vast number of positive reviews on this book. There are very few negative reviews. The message in this book is disturbing but maybe the most important you will ever read. As you will notice, a rare few will stick their head in the sand and look for technical mistakes in the Author's book rather than look at the message. Don't miss this book and don't miss it's message."
3,Reminded me of a book I'd have to read for school.,"My book club chose this book as our next read. I was quite reluctant to start - it reminded me of something I had to read in class. You sure can't be tired while reading this - cause you'll doze off. As soon as the gorilla started talking, I was like ""Are you kidding??"", but I eventually put that feeling aside and enjoyed the book. There were some things I hadn't really thought about or thought I cared about. I really liked the new interpretation on Genesis. I still feel a little powerless, even if I know the world is doomed."
3,i am trying to be a number,i like to see night time sugar specials like happy happy. a fun tease is jump to ninety nine on a hop board. GUNG! Simon Awesome! i wish for smile to take a nice plane to water bed warehouse. i jump!
2,Without Gorilla what happens to Dan.,"This novel was recommended to me by a friend and I thought it would be a good read. Unfortunately it is not. The story is silly and one sided and really cheesy, a telepathic gorilla? The author uses the bible as a historical document to prove points. The bible is fiction from a very small area in world 3000 to 2000 years ago, not a historical document to back up presented points about the state of the world. The main character also seemed very dense and could not learn from the gorilla!!?? Typical people are stupid animals are smart type fare. The author also presents the idea that all tribal people were nature friendly and eco smart not in those words but you get the picture. Yes let's just jump in a time machine and take everybody back to the Stone Age, just like the Gunghu gu tribe in the jungles of the Congo. Poor examples, poor arguments, poor reasoning, and faulty history make this a book to avoid."
1,Overblown and sophmoriphic,"Aren't we a magnificent genius, Mr. Quinn? ! While Ishmael may wow naive college students, anyone who is at least marginally introspective has probably already discovered the ultimate moral of this novel on their own. And since the whole book only exists for this one conclusion, there is no real reason to read it.Quinn sounds like he comes from the same soap-boxing style that Ayn Rand likes so much-- you'll discover the life lesson in the first few chapters, then drag through several dozen more only to discover Quinn has the same moral as an episode of Captain Planet.To be fair, he does have an interesting explanation for the origin of the Adam and Eve myth. But that is hardly worth suffering through the rest of this plotless dialogue."
1,The Only Book I've Ever Returned Based on Content,"A particularly irritating trait of humans is our proclivity to impose our ideas of how to live life on others. To embody this trait in a telepathic gorilla makes it borederline unbearable.I read 58 excrutiating pages of this book before returing it to the bookstore, binding still intact. If you want advice, don't look to this author's thinly veiled attempt to impose his surface, barely freshman level understanding of philosophy and social/environmental justice through a gorilla for the answer.I enjoy reading and books that have a message and are written creatively with an appreciation for the intellegence of their audience. I don't enjoy receiving the equivalent of a laundry list of things to do to be a better person - it makes me hostile.The only true principle I took from ""Ishmael"" is this: if you happen to meet a gorilla who tells you to meet him to discuss the failings of the human race- run!"
3,Waiting for the revelation,"I bought this book because a friend told me that it would change my outlook on the world. Although it was an interesting book with some interesting ideas, I'm still waiting for the big revelation. Definitely worth the read (it reads quickly), but I'm not ready to anoint it as a classic. It will give you something to think about, which is really all you can reasonably ask for in a book like this."
5,This will change the course of your life.,I can pinpoint the moment that my life went in a new direction to the moment that I picked up Ishmael from the shelf.Eagerly awaiting the new book!!
2,Alright,"This book was an OK book. it had some great ideas in it, such as distributing condoms instead of just food, to really help with the population problem. But in general i found Ishmael a bit dull. There was absolutely no plot. For a novel documenting the dialogue between a monkey and a man, you'd think there might be some action somewhere in the book. Nope. The guy goes into a bar and nothing happens! Just when you hope some new characters will be introduced. While my friends all seem to love this book, they have a higher tolerance for boring things and seem to like 'classics'. Instead of picking this up, i recommend reading Thom Hartmann's ""The last hours of ancient sunlight"" for some real inspiration and education"
4,Writing sideways on lined paper...,"Daniel Quinn has written a book that people will either love or hate. The reason to read it is right there. If such a book can inspire so many to write such empassioned reviews, then there must be an important message in it. Those who call it trite, or drivel seem to have an underlying fear in their reviews. Those who praise it so totally also have a certain fear. This book seems to say that we need to give up a great deal in order to save the world. If you look at the vision Mr. Quinn wants to express, then you can see that he wants us to see the world in a different light. Basically, the world would be a better place if we learn to understand that humanity isn't cursed."
3,"Odd Ideas, Well Written","Daniel Quinn does a brillant job creating a narrative backgground in which to place some very interesting ideas. I found the ideas to be odd, and the did not strike me as overly insightful. One high note is Quinn's textual analysis of the book of Genesis. A recommended read for those who are looking to examine their lifesyles macroscopically."
1,Childish,"There are a few good points in this book, but Quinn's back to nature argument is childish at best. The world isn't just going to drop everything and go back to hunting and gathering."
2,Bizarre,"Although parts of this book were intersting, in general, it was bizarre and difficult to get through."
1,Stolen from Disney Movie Plots,"The gist of this work of pseudo-philosophy is that human beings are evil takers who have ransacked the earth, and the animals are those who give back to the earth. This is a an evil/good binary philosophy for environmentalists written in such a simplified generalized way that the entire works comes off as propaganda written for the mouth of a anthropomorphic gorrilla. The soapbox is higher than the Sears Tower. Cute Lovable Animals. Evil Humans. How is this different from hundreds of Disney movie plots?"
1,More New Age drivel,"Oh come on! An answer to anthropocentrism? I give it one star because of the points made about the need to care for the earth. But we knew that, didn't we? Or is this Social Darwinism in disguise? That bit about not over-producing food for worldwide distribution as it will cause ever increasing overpopulation- dying isn't so bad, right? I would submit that there is hardly any worse way to die than by starvation. This book is quasi Socratic trudge to the maxim Live and Let Live. The history is ludicrously simplistic, the metaphor of Takers versus Leavers is ridiculous- and some of the Leavers groups Quinn uses to illustrate his point have some of the worst drug and alcohol problems on the planet. This is new age drivel- yet another guy with another idea which will save the earth. Believe this: If you didn't get it from your Bible you sure as shootin' aren't going to get it from this book."
2,"""Ishmael (how white males will destroy Earth)""","The book is written from the slant that white males in modern society are powerful enough to destroy the entire whole of life on the planet. If you agree, and you are ""searching"" for some way to ""solve"" modern society you may want to read this. If not, skip it entirely.The only reason it got 2 stars, instead of 1, is that it was fun to get mad about this and rant a little."
5,Clarification of 12/9 review,Yesterday I wrote a review for Ishamel. I'd like to clarify that I am a freelance columnist with The Arizona Daily Sun.Thank you. Jane Iddings
5,A thought provoking book,"Daniel Quinn's message is long overdue. It will make you question some of your most intimate visions of how life should be on planet earth, and what is mankind's role.In some parts of the book, the author may seem to provide a rather strong pessimistic view of the current global conditions. Overall the ideas are amazingly original, and allows us to think and maybe even change the way we treat the world and all its inhabitants."
5,A Different Look At The Same World,"Daniel Quinn's Ishmael presents a new perspective by looking at modern culture through the eyes of an outsider. In this story a man learns more about his own culture from Ishmael, a very educated gorilla with the power to talk telepathically. Ishmael explores our culture's 'truths' as myths. This book is thought provoking and well worth reading."
1,For people who have never thought before,"This is a terribly boring book. I speculate that it is popular because some people have not been exposed to ideas presented in this book. The ideas are not new or revolutionary - Mr. Quinn is not a ground-breaking philosopher. He is recycling what has been said before, and which an intelligent person can think about without any prompting.I found it incredibly boring not only because of the lack of philosophical (spiritual??) originality, but also because there is hardly a story line; the story line that does exist is hardly believable. I want to know where the gorrilla gets its' food and water and how does it reside in an office building? Where does it go to defecate? Where is animal control for the jurisdiction? It is a ridiculous and boring book. I am hoping that the bookstore will allow me to return it."
1,Liberalism at its worst,"Regardless on your thoughts about man vs the planet and about the best way to preserve both in harmony. This book is nothing more than the basic liberal attempt to blindside the arugment by stating his premise as fact and then basising all future theories on this ""fact"". But if you are not allowed to dispute the original arugment than all future arugments have to agree, hence no ability to make up your own mind. The author does this by his choice of words such as labeling one group as the ""leavers"" and the other group as the ""takers"" and stating that these names carry no meaning other than to identify the groups. This is what liberals do and I for one would like the 2 weeks back I wasted reading this veiled attempt and liberal brainwashing."
1,Horrible and Disturbing,"This book is blatantly anti-Semitic and anti-Christian blaming both groups with everything from over-population to animal extinction. The overall tone is pessimistic and negative. It premises are ridiculous and offensive and display nothing more than the author&#65533;s twisted take on history and his strong anti-religious views. Who will like this book? It will be loved by KKK members, environmental terrorists and people with no hope for the human race."
1,Ishmael...aaahhhh,"This book stinks! Aren't you supposed to actually understand it. When I had finished it (because the school assigned it), I burned it and then ate it! This book is like a dictionary. Step away kids, this book is dangerous."
4,Great thought provoking book but no solutions...,"This book was great in some of the random rants it went into. I really enjoyed being exposed to these new ideas. My only complaint is that it never really answers the question ""What can I do?"" It gives a cop out answer about spreading the word and never really tells you what you can do to solve the problems it brings to your attention. A great book though...thought provoking and eye opening."
4,Makes you wonder about everything that you learned in school,"In Ishmael Quinn makes the reader unlearn everything that our culture teaches us and then to examine it in a completely new way. This book will make you wonder about your faith, your history, and the future of man kind."
5,Do not wait to read Ishmael,"No matter what you may believe about life, the universe and everything, be prepared to be blown out of the water. Daniel Quinn is the most important writer of this age, or any other."
3,Too Short or Too Long,"Because of manner in which Mr. Quinn has told this story (Socratic Dialogue), he takes 250 or so pages to tell what could have been written in 10 - 20. And though the book is a quick read, if looked at in this perspective, it is too long. I believe the author used the dialogue method to help the reader slowly see how he arrives at his main point. However, the supporting arguments are not fully flushed out--which is understandable since there are entire wings of libraries filled with arguments for and against some of the assertions made by Mr. Quinn. I think his logic works if each of the premises hold. Unfortunately, that would entail that, among other difficult concepts, Mr. Quinn has reasoned correctly on ""nature vs. nurture"" and ""the human condition."" Mr. Quinn either needs more space to develop the argument or he needs to cut the book down by 90%. 250 pages are a lot of leaves to turn for a half-baked conclusion."
5,Reading Quinn's series may make you irrevocably happy.,"Ishmael is the beginning of the development of an idea that will become a thousand counter-cultures. Ishmael alone will probably not make you ready to change your life, but it does provide a foundation of ideas that makes Quinn's next book, The Story of B, make a lot more sense. And My Ishmael is the best thing going to put you back together again after B changes your life. By the time you're finished, it is very possible that things that make perfect sense to you now, like working 40+ hours a week, for instance, will seem like the silliest things you could ever dream up. This is the kind of book that can do that to you.Just do yourself a favor and don't read just Ishmael without having The Story of B and My Ishmael ready to go. By itself it's just an interesting concept. Fully developed, it's potentially the most influential manifesto to come along in almost ten thousand years."
2,Planet of the Ape Celestine Prophecy,"I dunno... the central angle of this book, that all the world's schools of thought are wrong...EXCEPT THIS ONE, is a bit hard to take. The narrator character, disillusioned with his previous gurus and mentors, finds enlightenment from a psychic gorillia, who apparently offers little different than his former teachers, other than he's a big hairy ape. Some people like this book, but not me."
1,Ishmael: Literary Pestilence,"I think it is rare for an author to so effectively capture every literary (and intellectual) horror. Ishmael is the home of atrocious writing, painful logic, and quicksand pacing: it is the longest of short books. And Quinn, with sadistic flair, so pummels the reader with repetitive, tiresome pseudo-socratic ramblings, that one is left weak and confused, hoping for mother culture's only certain salvation: the whisper of ""nuclear winter.&quot"
2,Boring,"I forced myself to finish this book only because it was given to me by a friend. This book is about Quinn preaching his philosophy through a fictional gorilla. I suppose he thinks it is easier to get his views across by voicing personal opinions through non-human form.I was irritated by the repetitiveness of the gorilla's lessons (What did we learn yesterday?) and the position of ""Think for yourself. You can't figure it out? Okay, I'll tell you what to think"".Quinn covers very few social topics, but presents them like they are the only items of importance. Out of 200+ pages, less than 50 were thought-provoking or interesting. The book is preachy, boring, and repetitive."
2,Annoying narrative,"I agree that this book contains interesting, thought-provoking ideas. However, they are presented as a work of fiction where a man has conversations with a gorilla. This conversation is essentially one long narrative by the gorilla, interrupted by the man occcasionally saying, ""I think I see what you mean"" or other empty banalities. There is no plot worth mentioning.The ideas in this book would have been much better served if the book had been written and sold as a plain, scholarly nonfiction book. As it is, it is just too annoying to read, and unsatisfying both to readers looking for a work of fiction and to those looking for philosophical ponderings about the role of humanity."
3,"No doubt about it, we're screwed.","What you should remember when reading this is that it is simply one way of looking at things, one opinion, one way of looking at humankind and where we're headed. After I finished reading this, I thought ""no way, the Goddess will save us."" And I sure as hell hope She does because this book points out what nobody wants to hear: we're doomed.So why not just kick back and enjoy life and leave the worries to the next generations? Because think about it. If you got inoperable cancer from a certain type of toothpaste, wouldn't you try to stop others from using said toothpaste so that they too wouldn't get inoperable cancer? That's why this book is important."
5,Can man exist without ape?,"My sister made me read this book, and when i started out on it, i wasn't as enthusiastic as i was half way through the book.What i really appreciate about the way this book was written is the way the author put many aspects of life and the way we all have grown to live our lives in the eyes of one of the most natural species of animal. This ape that we come to love in this book points out how we are raised and trained to look at the things so one-sidedly. Read this book, give it a try, it won't hurt you, it can only help. Read this book and re-think about how good it helps to drop nukes on other countries.If you like this book, check out the album called ""No Code"" by a band called Pearl Jam. Just think about it."
1,AN ATTACK ON ORGANIZED RELIGION!! MODERN SOCIETY'S PROBLEM!!,"I would have never chosen to read this book on my own. The only reason I read this book was because it was an assignment for class. The author presented his liberal ideas as fact instead of as a theory, which it is. The author's only evidence is hypothetical situations and distantly related examples. THERE WERE NO FACTS! Aside from being completely untruthful, the authors anaolgies were often too random and too off-topic to make any clear points. What's more, this book is AN ATTACK ON ORGANIZED RELIGION! I was deeply offended as all my values and ideals were treated like a hokey, senseless rubbish. THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH READING!"
2,Bizarre,Man has always found ways to do the wrong thing. Going to mother this and mother that for direction is a large step into the fantasy world. What institution did Quinn escape from?
5,Thought provoking,"Greetings,Never in my life have I read a book that spoke about many of the very things I believe. This a story about a gorilla that poses many of the same questions that people think about when the television is off, the mall is closed and their job is no longer making them happy.This book has expanded my beliefs and has given me a new insight. Hopefully it does the same for you."
4,Great little book!,"I read this long ago, and just gave it as a gift to my Dad. It's a positive, well-written little book, with excellent metaphors."
5,It Takes Some Time.....,I had to read this book for class a couple of years ago and I didn't really appreciate it until after the class was over with. The book is a must read for anyone. The message will stay with you for life!
5,BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"This book makes you think. I want to buy millions of copies and make everyone in our ""Taker"" society read it, understand it, and CHANGE! PLEASE read this book! It will be one of the best things that you'll ever do!"
2,Juvenile Ego-Stroking,"While I agree with much of the philosophy presented in Ishmael, the book is damned by its presentation. The author seems more concerned with stroking his ego and making his philosophy seem unique and mind-blowing than writing a good book. Instead of intelligent discourse, we've got a condescending monkey who repeats things ad-nauseum, has a penchant for hyperbole, and spends the rest of his time trying to make the author seem like a genius. Well guess what, Quinn? Any reasonably intelligent high schooler has thought of these things. Trust me, you are not the first. Keep the philosophy, just don't present yourself as brilliant for having it."
1,Avoid This Silliness,"This book reads as if it were written by an idealistic teenager who had recently read Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring""; ""The Trial of Socrates""; and other Socratic influenced pieces. A simple argument piece with no heft to it at all. I guess no gorilla can know everything, but Ishmael shares ""wisdom"" of a pre-21st century world, at best, and it shows."
5,Ishmael,"This book arrived in excellent condition, and in a fair time as well. It was not this, however, that made me pleased with my purchase. This book... should be read by anyone with an open mind. It is a valuable point of view that gets so easily ignored.Wonderful read... worth every penny."
4,An awaking experience,"Over all reading Ishmael was an awaking experience. The issues that Quinn used were all facts based on research done by philosphers, biologist, ecologist, and anthropologist. The truth in what the author was describing, with the gorrilla and narrator, about our culture was factual. It made me realize that our culture is rather spoiled. Some of the theories that the author wrote about I did not agree with, such as evolution. I did like how the biblical aspect was portrayed in the book.I like the wording in the book, for example I think this quote is great, ""Man was born to the world into a paradise, but tragically he was born flawed. And so his paradise has always been spoiled by stupidity, greed, destructiveness, and shortsightedness."" I think this quote pretty much sums up our culture. Overall if you want a book that test your intelletual view point about our world and the different views on how we came to be, I highly recommend this book to you."
5,Life-altering!,This book articulated ideas that have lingered just out of reach for me my whole life and offered a simple truth that on some level I've known all along. Now the world makes sense and I have an understanding of where change must occur in order to give our species a chance at survival. This is a must-read for every human being on the planet!
5,Ishmael,"This book is great. It was in very good conditions and it looked brand new. It arrived on time,I was amazed on how quickly it arrived."
4,read it to your children,"Ishmael put the overlooked, obvious objective view, into the forefront. Ishmael is a book everyone should read, especially children. A perfect gift for the disillusioned."
4,Ishmael,"In this book, the mindless chatter of modernity's empty consumerism and the trashing of air, earth, water, fire and our neighbors, are eloquently exposed to the angst-ridden Student through a Gorilla, Ishmael. Uncharacteristically, the Master human listens, and the creature prevails but only through using the Master's Tools of logic and persuasive human speech. But it takes what it takes. I have my doubts that the mind ever persuades the heart as much as one heart persuades another, but this book is one more route to follow in getting ""It"": to understand that humankind cannot continue its domination of an earth that was not created by or for it.Also recommended: The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock"
5,A spiritual guidepost,"Ishmael came to me via a spiritual journey in which gorillas were dominant. On telling an acquaintance about this journey, she recommended and loaned me her copy of Ishmael. It has been days since I finished reading the book and I still havent reached the depths of its effect on me. This book makes entirely too much sense to me. The last book that affected me this way was Richard Bach's Illusions. That book turned my life around and started me on a spiritual journey. I have a feeling this book will do as much."
5,Change your vision!,"This book really will change your life. It doesn't say things, which are way out there, but rather things we already know. Daniel Quinn will help you to put the pieces of the puzzle together in this insightful novel about our culture. Read it!"
3,Don't get carried away folks,"Its a good book, and it is certainly thought provoking. Unfortunately, like much of our society's products of ""scholarship"", it is based on some very scant research and relys so heavily on supposition that it is problematic. It is worth reading and is entertaining, but just don't take all of these folks that have had their ""life changed"" very seriously. It is a powerful book, but like all intense things, its fuel burns fast and hot and a year after you read it, you will mainly remember the talking ape."
2,Interesting nonsense,"This book, although presenting thought-provoking and somewhat unique ideas, also makes many very outrageous and unsupported claims. The main character just sits around as his teacher asks him crazy and ambigous questions which wastes lots of time. An example question: not exact quote sTeacher: What is your race's myth about creation?Main character: Are you refering to the genesis?Teacher: No.and they spend a page arguing whether the creation of earth etc. are just myths and eventually the main character agrees. Half of the book is just them dawdling about unsupported hypothesises. Many of the things that this so-called teacher claim can be found to be exactly incorrect when given serious thought.If you are gullible or stupid and want to here what may seem to be revolutionary insights until you think then I reccommend this book for you."
1,The Story of a Teacher/For Quinn is Just a Preacher,"The story of a teacher seeking a student, but not just any student! You! In page after page, the author, speaking through his ""teacher"" in the form of an 800 lb gorilla, demonstrates his complete ignorance of even the most basic principles of population and economics. Quinn almost urges a return to the hunting and gathering lifestyle never minding the fact that this prescription would shave the earth's population thinner than the hair on a baboon's bottocks. If I had read this book when I was young, I may have been taken in by Quinn's primitive arguments. But in my old age, I recognize that his logic belongs to an age of ignorance something like 8 million years ago, when we branched off from the gorillas. Interesting given his choice of avatars."
1,Bankrupt,"Writing as one who teaches Conservation and Environmental Sciences at the college level, I can say that this book contains more factual, scientific, and ethical flaws than any other single book I have ever read. If you wish to teach students to think critically this would be a great book to dismember paragraph by paragraph. It represents the worst of 1970's touch-feely environmental thought. I could write a dissertation on the problems this book represents. The most fascinating and disturbing aspect of the book is its ability to completely seduce the uniformed. I have yet to meet a single academic Historian, Anthropologist, Geographer, or Environmental Scientist, who likes this book."
5,"Taker or Leaver, the future doesn't belong to you alone .","First recommended by Oprah on one of her shows, ""Ishmael"" hasimpressed upon me the importance of leaving this world in thesame or better condition than when I arrived. The Takers aresure that the world is here for humans...the Leavers knowbetter. This book should be included in every High Schoolcurriculum, it is that important."
4,READING QUINN FOR THE WRONG REASONS,"Having read Ishmael, My Ishmael and the Story of B, I believe that many readers who attack Quinn's writings are reading the stories for the wrong reasons to begin with. Admittedly, the ""stories"" in each of these books are weak at best, with uninspiring, often dim witted characters, but one must consider that it is doubtfull that Quinn every wrote them from an entertainmer's point of view. These ""stories"" are but vehicles for Quinn's often very insightful, and if nothing else, fairly unique view of humaity. If you are looking for a good story, go some place else. If you are looking for what many consider ""life changing"" ideas and perspectives, you should definately read Ishmael, My Ishmael and the Story of B."
5,This is the most interesting and life changing books ever.,"If you are interested in saving this planet, as well as reading a good book (choose Ishmael). I would suggest this book to anyone with an open mind. Tell your friends about this book."
5,The Socratic Method Given New Life,"Daniel Quinn takes the age-old method of teaching through question and answer to new levels in this riveting book. It should be mandatory for everyone who counts themselves as a member of the living. If this book doesn't move you to take action, then nothing will, and our fate on this planet will surely be sealed."
3,"4 stars for the ideas, but 0 stars for the narrative","this book sucks. it has absolutely no literary merit whatsoever and is a major pain in the ass to read through. however, read through it I did and i'm actually glad I did because the ideas don't really get going until the last quarter of the book. Essentially, the first 3/4s are drivel, no-brainer stuff than anyone ought to know but Daniel Quinn feels is necessary to repeat and restate in a question-answer format (that is so annoying!) for the benefit of all. But the ideas that Daniel Quinn presents us and the evidence he offers are really innovative and interesting. Overall, it was decent. his ideas saved the book, but this story is absolute garbage."
1,"New Religion, better than the old!","We believe in the sacred earth, the life-giving force around us,and in the Eden from whence we came,before man ate from the tree of knowledge,before man fell from graceand descended into violence, exploitation, industrialization and pollution.We believe in Sustainability, our hope for salvation,and the limiting of harmful agricultural,the protection of biological diversity,the communion of man,the reduction of possessions,the elimination of greed,the recycling of matter,and the unending circle of life.Amen"
1,....zzzzzz...,This book is soooo boring that I fell asleep when reading it as a school assignment. I have never read a more uneventfull book. Do not purchase this book without reading the first few pages first.
1,Worst Book Written by Mankind *EVER*,This is the worst book I have ever read! Comeon Daniel can't you think of anything more thought inspiring than a telepathic gorilla trying to save the rainforest? This is the most hippiesh book i have ever read! NO ONE BUT TREE HUGGERS CARES ABOUT THE RAINFOREST SO GO PREACH TO THEM!
5,Ishmael,"Daniel Quinn gives an extraordinary new view to ideas that everyone at one time or another have pondered. He brings to life ideals that most people have difficulty digested. He brings these views and ideals into reality in such a way as to captivate his readers and keep them searching for more. The most interesting part is that of the teacher: a gorilla named Ishmael.Upon reading ""Ishmael"" for the first time I found that the ability to digest the material worked greatly to my understanding and there were no words or ideas that were brought forth by Ishmael that were hard to follow or understand."
4,Darwinism,"The book will cause you take a probative look into all that we have learned about our ""civilized"" culture and that of ""primative"" third world bretherin. The only problem that I had with the book was that it didn't go too far. The narrator of the book offered little resistance to Ishmael's thoughts. Here is a gorilla basically telling you of the evilness of your ways and all you say in turn is yes I see. Or, when Ishmael stumps the guy, Ishmael says think harder and then the guy instantaniously gets it. That aspect made the dialouge a bit unrealistic. But in terms of the depth of knowledge and ability to make the reader think, the bookn is incredible. A definite must read."
4,Food for Thought - neither more nor less than we need,"The premise seems crazy, if inventive. This ""dialogue"" between a man and a gorilla turns out to be an exercise in critical thinking (good, therefore, for everyone!) Ishmael invites the reader to question the very underpinnings of ""modern"" culture. I don't know about you, but I find that to be a very worthy enterprise. We do seem to be driving ourselves to extinction - maybe Ishmael has something to teach all of us."
5,A handbook for those who want to change the world,"This book is among the greatest I've ever read - along with The Story of B and My Ishmael. It is an insightful look at the world's problems and how people need to change. Contrary to what some religious fanatics would say, Ishmael is not an attack on religion and Daniel Quinn isn't an immoral person. His explanations are great and very easy to understand. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever questioned why we're here."
3,A thought provoking read,My friends at school begged for me to read this book and when i finally did I was disappointed. I had expected a life-changing experience or perhaps some form of enlightenment. Neither of these occurred. Still the book was quite thought provoking and definetely deserves some kind of honor. But in the same respect no book has so much to offer that it can be considered a bible.
1,Worthless,"If it were not required for a humanities class, this book would have found its way to the trash long before I had the misfortune to finish. The book is nothing more than new age fodder for wanna-be hippies and baby boomers looking for answers to how their lives became so empty. I can say that Mr. Quinn needs to get out of whatever commune of self help and get rich quick guru's he's stuck in, and find his way to the real world."
1,"interesting message, oddly written","i won't comment about the style, as many others have- but calling this a novel is pushing it.apparently in order to save the earth, we must abandon not only our evil civilization, but even be prepared to accept our individual deaths (from starvation, disease) as acts in the hands of the gods. tough stuff for even a leaver society to swallow, i think."
1,worst ever,"This is the worst book ever. The author is too stupid to do the actual research, so he ecologically rants through a telepathic ape to avoid footnotes and the need to research sources."
2,"describes a problem, but never attempts to solve it","the ape idea wasn't too thrilling. quinn could have at least made the ape not omniscient. for this, quinn tries to convince the reader to listen to the ape and change your beliefs. i thought the whole book was a sermon. the dialogue was horrendous. one couldn't understand whether it was the omniscient ape or the man talking. first everything the man answers is wrong. then all of a sudden he too becomes omniscient and is answering all the questions perfectly. quinn has innovative thoughts, but his evidence and support are dwindling. he continues to go off on tangents. by the end of the novel, i was thinking i'm gonna go watch ""the planet of the apes."" if you really want to help the environment like quinn says, take a class on waste management or pollution control."
1,Major Flaws,"When I first read this book in high school it seemed flawed somehow, but I couldn't articulate why. I forgot about it until I just now finished readingGuns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond, which addresses the same topic as Ishmael--the development of agriculture and rise of civilization--but does so thoroughly, logically, and with some real scholarship. Reading it made me think of Quinn's book and I understood what was wrong with Ishmael--it is armchair philosophy instead of real research. Quinn has a interesting theory, but it dosen't come near real anthropology."
5,Wake up,"The point of a book like Ishmael is to show peoplet that life can be carried out in so many ways. That life can be fun without work. It does not state what is, it tries to tell the truth in the hope that you will find what the truth for you is.If you can wake up to the modern world, trust me i have done it, it is one of the most beautiful experiences in the world. It has to be, for when you see the world with truth you have gone to heaven, you have become perfect. I am not exagerating, you see that your culture has flaws, and you reacted to them as perfectly well. It is not your fault you have been lied to.Read this book if you have a feeling that something inside you is dead. it will show you what is wrong"
5,Mind Altering,"One of few books which has managed to completely alter my state of mind between the time I began the book and the time I finally put it down.The ways in which Quinn challenges our perceptions of the world, our lives, our purpose on earth, the way in which we operate and the systems that constrain us is remarkable.In the tradition of Zen and lifelong meditation Ishmael presents a set of existential questions that may never be fully answered and certainly have no right/wrong approach. The value lies in the questions themselves and our ability to allow them to have personal application. Whether or not we can apply Quinn's logic and understanding conveyed through Ishmael to our own lives and sense of purpose even our core values is the ultimate test."
5,A Different kind of book,This is a book for anyone who wants to be challenged by ideas that are against everything that we as a human race know. It is extremely mind expanding and enlightening. That is why it is such a great book. It makes you think.
4,Think outside the box,"The arguments presented in ""Ishmael"" are not the best presented or the most overly convincing - other than ""our way of life is wrong"" I quite honestly am not quite sure what Ishmael is suggesting we do as a society. However, what makes me love this book is the fact that its ways of looking at the world are entirely unusual - truly thinking ""outside the box"". It presents so many alternative ways of looking at the world, the ways of which we take for granted as being set, that it always makes me wonder what else I might have missed in life."
4,Ishmael,"I liked this book. It had a very distinct flavor. The gorilla was very interesting. I didn't always agree with all of the ideas in the book, but it was still interesting to read. The blend between fantasy and fact was fascinating. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in reading about the environment and who are open to different ways of looking at the impact that humans have on the environment."
2,The BOOK isn't that good. The IDEAS are.,"I can understand why this book could be so life altering to someone who had never carefully considered the place of Man in the world. But as someone who had, and read the book with that mindset, I found the writing to be somewhat tedious.Here is what is weak about this book: The plot, the characters, the writing.Here is what is strong about this book: The central idea."
5,opens the mind,"For those who truly want to explore how we got to where we are, this is the best book around. In order to grasp Ishmael's teaching, it is necessary to set aside preconceived ideas about dogma and organized religion. Anyone who cares about the planet we live on, the way we treat all species, including ourselves, can learn much from this book. Since the publication, I've read Ishmael at least a dozen times. Every time I pick it up I learn something new, a different way to look at events, an approach to change I had not thought of."
5,Hmm,"If you have not read this book, you might be wondering why so many reviewers would characterize it as ""life changing"" and why the rest of them seem to be so ticked off. This book will ask you to reconsider everything you've ever been told.Even if you don't agree with everything Quinn says, it must cause you to think.There are very few books that I can say have changed me, and this is one of them. Do yourself and the rest of us a favor by reading it."
5,Interesting,A very thought provoking book that gives and interesting look into our culture. I'm not sure I fully agree but I do enjoy learning from others view points
3,"Many good ideas, but next time skip the lousy dialogue","""Ishmael"" is filled with challenging and potentially life-changing ideas. What bothered me was that the characters and plot were not very well fleshed-out. I would have preferred it if this book had been written in an essay form, as the conversations between Ishmael and his nameless pupil hinder the progress of the book. Half of the time, we understand where Ishmael is going with his line of thought pages before the pupil does, causing Ishmael's points to be repeated over and over after we already understand them. Much of the dialogue consists of the pupil simply agreeing with Ishmael. ""Yes."" ""I see."" ""Yes, I understand."" It gets a little distracting. Nonetheless, I recommend that you read this book in order to gain a fresh perspective on the natural order of our world."
1,Puerile Utopianism at its worst.,"In this book, Quinn opines that the hunting and gathering way of life is superior to our own. He believes this while presumably enjoying all the comforts of modern industrial civilization, and he shows no sign of joining the Bushmen, nor do I see any of his ardent fans doing so either. The tendency to idealize pastoral life from afar is as old as the Greeks and Quinn is merely the latest to express this flawed idea."
1,Pretentious crap,"I can't believe all the lavish praise everyone's pouring on this book. Its not that good! Some of the ideas are interesting, but you have to slog through all this poorly written dialog to get there. And the author uses the dialog format to praise his own ideas. One character will say something, and the other will exclaim ""Thats the most amazing idea I've ever heard!"" Quinn's pretentiousness drove me crazy. Don't bother with this book."
5,A new perspective,"In a nutshell, this book presents a thoughful and somewhat different perspective on human kind and our role in this ecosystem.I've no doubt some people will be unable to get past our friend the gorilla but for those of you willing to finish the book before you start picking it apart, you will find yourself challenged to think about your life and place in the universe in ways you may not have already considered. This work is important in that it aims to build a better future by teaching us from a new perspective.At a time when our leaders rule by fear and destructive action, this work makes every effort to be constructive and truth seeking about life. It is my great hope that you will take a chance and read this story. It can teach you a great deal."
5,The conservationist's bible,This book is awesome! I am taking an environmental conservation class and it could be the textbook...It is definitely a must read for anyone who thinks that we are not in trouble with our earth and pollution and all the problems that go on in our world from the way we are treating it. It will blow your mind. It's easy to read too!
5,Fascinating!,Ishmael is truly a fascinating novel and has changed the way I think. It truly makes you want to go out and change the world. The arguments are well thought out and explained and the story is easy to follow. Quinn doesn't bore the reader with boring philisophical terms without first explaining them.
2,A false prophet again,"I didn't understand the book. What is the solution advocated? A return to the hunter-gatherer life style? What does it mean to escape captivity?We cannot escape captivity by replacing one myth with another. There is no going back to a tribal or hunter gatherer way of life. Any attempts to ""save the planet"" by spiritually unawakened people will result in suffering and death. It always has when man has tried to ""improve"" or ""save"" his fellow men.What we need is a spiritual awakening. When man resorted to a settled agricultural way of life his natural self awareness and unity with the whole was obscured by an obsessive robotic thinking brought about by the change in lifestyle. Now the natural state for the human mind is to see complete separation in everything. Just a ""message"" to save the world will not help. It might just lead to more suffering.A spiritual awakening will naturally bring about the realization of the one self and our inter connectedness with all nature."
1,"Pete and Repeat were on a boat, Pete fell off who was left?","This book is frustrating. Not in the sense that I somehow subconsciously disagree, for I found many of the ideas to be intriguing if not true. It was frustrating because it was poorly written. Boring. Smug. Repetitive. Boring. Smug. Repetitive. Boring. Smug. Repetitive.""There were some great, interesting points, but who wants to listen to it drilled into your head over and over. I also thought that a telepathic monkey was stretching it a bit... It had NO plot what-so-ever, and this made it EXTREMLY boring. I read this for a class, and sometimes couldn't keep reading, even when I had NOTHING else to do. You'd do a lot better to read ANY other book. I recommend the Giver, it was a good book (very entertaining) with many good points. END"
5,Answers questions that I did not know who or how to ask,"This is an amazing book that looks deep within our civilized culture to find answers that explain what we are doing wrong. If the reader is willing, this book can inspire individual change that can affect the world in a positive light. Everyone needs to listen to Pearl Jam's ""Yield"" album after reading this book. I have passed this book on to everyone I know. Do you have a desire to save the world? Read this book and live easy."
2,"If you have read the ""Story of B"" don't buy this","A fantastic idea presented very well by Quinn, but it is exactly the same concept raised in the story of B. So whilst either novel is very much worth a read don't buy both, you'd be wasting your money!"
3,An Adventure Indeed,"I am not writing a review to critique the author on his style, syntax, or creativity. His written word is eloquent. I LOVED the premise of the book ""Teacher seeks pupil. Must have earnest desire to save the world. Apply in person."" What could be more intriguing? My problem was it took me 263 pages to find out what you already knew in the first chapter. I kept reading to see if I could learn more. I didn't. Perhaps I wasn't intelligent enough to get his point?"
2,The Undercurrent of Anger Was a Bit Too Much,"I enjoyed some of the methods of thinking that ensued, but the author''s constant disgust and judgments on humanity were too much to fathom."
4,Provocative,"Quinn does a good job raising some interesting questions through the voices of a pupil and a teacher. The teacher happens to be a gorilla, but no matter.The revolution of the agrarian society vs. the hunter-gatherer society is examined. The bias against the agrarian society is hard to miss, however, the hunter-gatherer society has left us few books, and few technological advances beyond knives, spears and axes, so what is the point? That we should go back to the hunter-gatherer society that our society evolved from?One of the thoughts I really appreciated was the feeling that current society or Mother Culture seems to tell us to ""take our place"" or we won't be fed.Ideas of over-population of the planet and misuse of resources are also examined.Although I don't agree with many of the ideas in this book, I found it to be thought provoking and worth the money."
3,Whoa there stallion. The ape is loose!!!,"Although I whole heartedly disagree with the authors viewpointin this text, I did find this a pleasing way to while away rainyafternoons. Depending on your perspective and grip on the facts,you may or may not find yourself enlightened by what Mr. Quinnespouses to be the origins of man. Some would have us believethe world has gone to the dogs, in this case as told by an ape."
1,My High School Composition Teacher Would Have Given This a C,"I was very disappointed by this book. The insipid dialogue and the pandering nature of the entire book was distracting. Quinn could have made his point in about 20 pages, but he painfully drags it out, beats it death, then beats it some more.The points that this book has to make are quite valuable. It is unfortunate that the presentation is so weak."
1,"Some merit to the message, but the delivery...","A friend highly recommended I read this, with the implication that it was a revelatory experience, so I picked up a used copy.There is some merit to the message, but the delivery is atrocious. I found ""Ishmael"" to be extremely heavy-handed and bombastic - every viewpoint the author espouses is spelled out for the reader through a thin veil of narrative. It's written using simplistic and unimaginative language - utterly lacking in delicacy and subtlety (kinda like this review!). It's comparable to a young adult novel in terms of complexity. The book's premise and the data used to support it has a very dated feel - there's not much in it for modern readers.I recommend you get your fix through some other literary source. If you consider yourself reasonably well-read, ""Ishmael"" will be a struggle to complete."
1,yawn,"This is a classic example of the sort of ""pop philosophy"" book which excites people who have never read anything else. If you're a teenager who hasn't read any philosophy, history, science, or anything else really, then read this book! You'll be blown away, I promise.Literate people, stay far, far away. This book will waste time better spent on something with more substance."
3,"Solitary, Poor, Nasty, Brutish, and Short is Good!","This book has a significant overall message - but historical inaccuracies and deep philosophical weaknesses get in the way of the story. Ishmael is loaded with blanket generalities that oversimplify what humans are and have been. The book decries man's aggressiveness, destructiveness, ego, overconsumption, etc. in ways found in past Utopian writings such as Thomas More and even Marx - but it never answers the following question. What do we do with people who don't want to abandon the above types of behavior (shoot them?) Mr. Quinn criticizes the mythologies of the world and then creates his own."
3,It's all right,"I don't really know about this book, it may be beacause of my age, but I didn't really enjoy it. I thought it was good becasue of all the very thought out ideas and plots, but I didn't agree with alot of thoes ideas. I'm sick of hearing how we are hurting the world. And I think that is one of the basis's of this book."
4,opening up to Ishmael,"Ishmael was a very intersting book. If it had not been assigned to me I am sure it is a book I never would have read. However, after finishing the book I am glad it came into my hands. The book emphasizes human behavior and whether you agree with it or not it allowes you to open your mind to new ways of thinking. With the use of analogies the reader is able to envision what is being said. Ishmael, while not centered on environmalism, helps bring the reader to a new awareness of the world around them and all life in it. I recommend this to all those seeking a book with a different kind of style and opions on life in general."
4,good start for CHANGE,"I just think this work is a great starting point for folks who are ready for CHANGE. Here's a thought provoked by this book's lesson... Since man was not even man (yet), we have battled one another. We have separated into two tribes as Quinn labels, the ""leavers"" and ""takers"". We need to remove the veil that makes us believe that there was a time where all was fair and groovy. The HISTORY of man will tell you that this is the biggest illusion created by men who contort facts and sell-out living a good life here on earth for a redemption when we hit the dirt. WhoooaaH. This is a great book to read so you have some FACTS and HISTORY to rely upon when spreading the GOOD word to others. Read it and then read some more of it.Peace,Karmasoda"
5,Intreguing...I'm buying My Ishmael right now!,"My husband & I both thoroughly enjoyed Ishmael and look forward to more Quinn. Need we say more other than ""Try it, you'll like it"""
4,This is only the tip of the iceberg.,"Ishmael presents wonderful ideas that everyone should hear. After reading it, however, my life was not changed. It was only after reading other Daniel Quinn books that I realized Ishmael is the introduction to a treasure of information. The ideas may challenge alot of people, but can only be dismissed by those fully under the spell of ""Mother Culture""."
4,a great book. go read it.,"this is really a great book, and it will open you to a perspective you never considered before. i highly suggest you go out and buy and read this book, it is incredible. you will be changed."
2,From an Environmental Philosopher,"I feel this book is highly overrated. The ideas are old and tiered. My personal opinion: ""yeah, yeah, we know."" Ironically enough, he writes his animal character with the same kind of arrogance he criticizes. If you want to read a work that I feel is more current environmental philosophy that is showing us the way rather than reiterating history read ""The Abstract Wild"" by Jack Turner (fantastic) or look into the works of William McDonough. Two stars because if you are the last to know about the rise of controlling mechanisms in society this will give you a decent introduction."
5,Those who've given this poor reviews...,"Those who've given this book poor reviews, it's pretty obvious to me, can't handle having the very basic assumptions of modern life challenged because it's so threatening to them personally.Yes, using a telepathic gorilla in the story is a strange literary device -- but it's just that, a *LITERARY DEVICE*. But it works."
1,A logical view,"For what this book has done for me I would give it a 10, but as I read what others have written I feel compelled to give it a 1. The reason I give would normally give it a 10 is not because ""It opened my eyes!"" or ""Finally, a book for 'thinkers'!"" No, I would give give it a 10 because it forced me to extract the grievences I had with it onto paper. Ishmael is a book full of poor anologies and skewed logic where benefit comes from being able to view the various inconsistancies, rather than from enlightenment. The reason I rate it at a 1 is because it has closed off many of those who read it. Many of the 10's rage about how Ishmael has changed their way of thinking, which is not a bad thing. However, many use the key word forever, and those who've been truely enlightened know that real knowledge is always open to change. I apologize to any followers of Ishmael I may have offended, but hopefully in offending you I also have presented a few new ideas which you may ponder."
1,"with brain gone, is there hope for quinn?","This book is frustrating. Not in the sense that I somehow subconsciously disagree, for I found many of the ideas to be intriguing if not true. It was frustrating because it was poorly written. Boring. Smug. Repetitive. Boring. Smug. Repetitive. Boring. Smug. Repetitive."
1,OUTDATED AND TRITE,"This book was insulting to read. It assumed its readers did not have a basic understanding of evolution, anthropology and philosophy. Ishmeal is about a great ape who teaches a human about our place in the world, trite, very trite. It was tremendously annoying to have to imagine an erudite gorilla pontificating telepathically to a student while chewing on a stick.This book is very outdated. Its message can be summed up in one sentence...Humans are not the center of the universe and therefore should not live that way. There, I just saved you $13.95 (plus shipping and handling)."
2,Dumb noble-savage mythos ruins intriguing premise.,"The idea this book is based on is promising: How to save the world for those who once really wanted to, but have since become cynical and depressed about the whole thing. With gorilla as guru: a sort of primate Socrates. Cool!Unfortunately, the teaching very quickly turns out to be nothing more profound than rehashed noble-savage mythology. Humankind is bluntly divided into 2 camps: the ancient, nature-respecting ""Leavers"" (as in ""Leave it alone""), and the very modern, world-wrecking ""Takers"" (in other words, ANY of us who actually enjoy use of the technology that enables us to post these reviews!).Actually, I found the book at times entertaining, but would like to have seen a much more thoughtful and challenging human student. The gorilla gets away with far too much over-generalizing and historical revisionism; Quinn could have livened up the dialogue immensely with a much more liberal dosage of counter ideas."
2,Why not read a good book instead?,"I'm not going to say this book has no redeeming qualities. Underneath the faux-mystical ""enlightenment"" that's supposed to be going on here, there are some valid points: societies that rely on non-sustainable methods are non-sustainable (duh), and that this isn't a very compelling message (duh).The long, meandering, and usually boring path that we have to take to get to this message, and the program for saving the world offered once it is revealed, are both a waste of time. Anyone seriously interested in the topic of society and ecological collapse would be much better served reading a scholarly work or two on the topic. Anyone not seriously interested should probably just read some good fiction."
1,Does not work,This is better at keeping me away from an area then my cats. To me it Stinks my brother can't smell anything and I think neither can my cat because after spraying an area to where its soaked couple of hours later he's there going no 2 again. I have used up 75% of the can in a few days and it has don't nothing to train the cat. What a waste of money.
2,Need to spray ALOT to have it work for you,"With poor packaging, the product came with a broken top, which of course, is still spray-able, so we did not return the product, esp when we needed to use it urgently anyway.However, the product was not as effective as we want it to be. It came with a strong smell and we need to spray alot to make it work for just a day or two. So basically, if you want it to work, you have to spray it EVERYDAY with a LARGE quantity, too. Because we were spraying it at our rose garden to keep the neighbor's cat away, we also noticed that we cannot water the plant after spraying, and the winter rain is just not helping."
1,Didn't work at all,I have to two cats and this only worked with one of them and only while it was still wet. The cat with the problem wasn't even phased by it at all. It was not worth our money.
2,Does not work,It does not seem to keep our cats off the areas where we have sprayed. It has an unpleasant odor but that does not seem to bother the cats. I think I wasted my money.
4,It even worked on me,My cat LOVES to chew on wires and most of the time im on the computer and he comes and chews it right next to meI sprayed the can all over and the smell of over salted water hit my nose so hard that even I left till the smell lessenedAfter a while I got used to it but cat still doesn't like it
1,smells so bit sad i cannot tolerate but the cats could careless and went right on eating things they should not,"smells so bad i cannot tolerate it but the cats could careless and went right on eating things they should not which is a huge problem, my male cat has PICA( he eats strange things such as carpet fibers, loose threads from any where, hair etc)"
1,Miscatagorized Product,"This product should be listed in the category of Human Repellent. It smells *awful* and....it gives you a raging headache the minute it hits the air. Meanwhile, the cats are blithely strolling up to smell the furniture in question, sniffing inquisitively, and then blissfully scratching away. It's like a comedy routine.If you don't want to end up clutching at your forehead while listening to the (now very painful) sound of claws on furniture, I would advise against trying this product."
1,Does not work,"I have a 12 yr old female cat and a 5 yr old male cat. I bought this is try to keep them off the tables and counters. It did not phase them one bit, they didn't even sniff around like they could smell anything."
2,Stinks,"If you have Allergies, do not buy . It's odor is strong and pungent. It works poorly . My cat ignores it and goes back to same spoy"
1,Did not work for me,"My cat does not really seem to mind the smell very much. He will avoid the spot that is sprayed for about an hour, after that the repellent has evaporated to the point that it no longer does any good. It doesn't seem to matter how much spray I use. Would not recommend."
2,Didn't stop my cats,"I got this product to stop my cats from sitting on the window, but it never stopped them. I think it is my fault though, because the products smell was so strong and bad after an hour I had to clean it."
2,read it if you read the Enquirer,"I fell for the hype and bought this book for full price... This book is bad for several reasons. Let me sum them up: 1) It is not believable. The author takes huge liberties in order to make this old story sound sensational, such as his claim about a painting with a woman and a cigar, which is not true and the artist has rebuked. It is conjecture passing as nonfiction... 2) The author's premise is related to the morality of the 60's but somehow it just isn't interesting. 3) The story is old... 4) The author's narcissism is painful to read. Summary: This book is humorous and was carefully crafted, and I want to like it, but unfortunatly I just want my money back."
1,No Star Billing,"I'm thoroughly disgusted with myself for buying this trash. This ugly screed makes The National Enquirer look like the Congressional Record. I'm all for invective, but this guy has no subtlety, no wit, and less insight than the smarmy columnists in most men's mags."
4,Animal House presents the Clinton Impeachment,"This book tries to be a no-holds-barred, pull-back-the-covers, over-the-top report on the Clinton scandals. It succeeds. This is not the book to buy if you want a sober recitation of the facts or a thoughtful analysis of why impeachment failed; it is, however, the first place to start if you want amusing (but unsubstantiated) rumors about Clinton's sex life, and plenty of names named (whether justified or not). Occasionally, you get a few insights that may be worth something beyond sleaze value, such as Larry Flynt's role in dethroning Newt Gingrich's would-be successor, but mostly this is an unpretentious hatchet book having fun with the most mockable of recent presidents. Occasionally Eszterhas will get a little too gross for most readers (the last thing I wanted was another recounting of the cigar incident), but almost everyone will get some laughs out of this book."
1,Blah Blah Blah,"This book just rambles on and on and never seems to end. I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a book. Since I started to read it, I feel like I have to finish it. I am just praying for that day to come soon. I have to skip over entire paragraphs just to get through a chapter. It is overwhelming proof that hippies should NEVER write books."
5,Where has this author been hiding??,"Incredibly funny...but a dagger thru ""President"" Clintons heart...and his ""willard""!! ! Haven't read a book as cynically funny since Catch-22. Tears rolled I laughed so hard, then found myself wondering if it could really be true? He borders on libel...and I understand a few people in the book have taken him to task over his insinuations. I passed this book up on several occasions because it was his (Joe Eszterhas') first; now I'm looking for his next one!! Who will be next?? He makes you wonder if what he says can really be true...or is it ""Memorex""."
4,Good comparison between Wash. and Hollywood,"The Books premise: life in Hollywood and DC are the now ridiculouly the same. How right Joe is. Perhaps the key variable difference between them is still seeking fame drives manics in one city, while the other is power. You end up with the same degenerate (or fun!) result: sex and more sex, but finally sorid hypocritical lies and curruption. The book's demonstration of this is a great and lively read that may constructively lead us to a self-examination.Is Joe warning us all that this is a result of what type of Americans we are allowing ourselves to be? Have our standards sunk this low? If so, thank you Joe for helping us to perhaps recognize this and turn it around."
4,I can't read this trash....where did I leave that book?,"This is the kind of 'trash' that those pretending to have an intellect wouldn't be caught dead reading on an airplane. I know its trash, how could a book about the Clinton Administration not be trash, but it's almost impossible to put it down. The author has written a stylistic nightmare that's more fun than peanutbutter. MS"
1,?,"Mr. Esterhaz wins my most cynical book of the year award. While I'm NO fan of President Clinton, the author doesn't appear to like anybody (except Jane Fonda of Hanoi fame). I don't think we need to know all the sleaze- manufactured or true- when there remain topics of critical importance to be explored such as East and now West Timor, AIDS, Sri Lanka, famine and the likes. Humor is always appreciated by this reader, but not when it is at the expense of others. The author does appear to have devoted considerable effort in writing this ""tell all"" tale and for effort he wins 1 star- besides there is no check box for zero stars. A waste of time and paper in what sounds to me to be this man's personal struggle at self- justification for an early life style that he now questions. Using my special alphabetized library filing system, I've filed this in my bookcase under 'R' (for rubbish)."
1,"Grow up, Mr. Eszterhas","I was disgusted by Mr. Clinton's actions in the White House, but feel that this author is still full of the 60's mess and has not yet grown up. Why not put some sense into this book and make something out of what Mr. Clinton did to abuse and debase the presidency as well as the Oval Office. I cannot finish this obscene mess of writing. Sorry I paid good money for it."
2,Political Scandels ala Eszterhas,"I'm all for satire and a good wicked read -- especially when it comes to hollywood or politics. But this book never quite rose to all it's hype and expectations. Claiming to be a gleeful ""tell-all"" book about the Clintons and other such scandels, AMERICAN RHAPSODY wants to be a scathing satiric review of political limelight. Instead it's a good idea with no consistent sense of direction. There are moments of hilarity and occasional comic insight but mostly this is a predictable, over the top book featuring segments like ""Willard Comes Clean"" (translating to: the confessions of the president's penis.) A little disappointing."
2,A Wade Through Eszterhas' Pretension,"Eszterhas may have had a point to make in writing this book unfortunateley one has to wade through page after page of his own self inflated, name dropping, ultra left wing, pretensious posturing to ( hopefully ) find it. The subject of the book - Clinton/Lewinsky ramifications ( I assume ) - seem to be more a handy facade for the projection of Joe's personal, so called liberalistic, axe grinding.If you already know that the Handsome/Sweetie saga was symptomatic of the present Dark Age we've entered then don't waste your time on this book.I mean Joe seems to be under the impression that Showgirls ( he was the screenwriter ) is a worthwhile film. Need I say more?This book contributes no REAL enlightenment on it's subject matter. An F grade re-hash of the Starr Report.Do yourself a favor skip this and buy yourself buy anything by PJ O'Rourke instead."
4,Sleaze-O-Plenty!,"Wotta hoot! I received this book today and have already plowed through the first sixty or so pages of this aging baby boomer's diatribe against the Big Boomer who's soon going to be out of a job! I fully expected Eszterhas to be a Clinton Apologist, and while that may yet happen, the first few chapters are devastating as all-get-out, delivering disturbingly hilarious 'blow-by-blow' accounts of what Bubba's been up to. Warning...unless you leave copies of Hustler lying around the house in full view of your toddlers, pre-schoolers, grade school children, pre-teens or post-pubescent kids, DO NOT LEAVE THIS BOOK UNATTENDED! There's a boatload of funny, yet truly salacious material in this and if innocent hands open 'American Rhapsody', randomly to any page, those innocent hands will quickly grow hair upon the palms. But for the rest of us, two thumbs up! Now, I gotta go. Where's my cigar...and, why're my hands itchy all of a sudden...what's wrong with my eyesight...?"
1,From OURHAS to ESZTERHAS,"Have the cultural and political realities changed THAT MUCH since Robert Coover's ""The Public Burning""? Certainly imagination and intellect reigned, in creating the absurd images of a chicken hawk Uncle Sam, and the unlikely sexual fantasies of Richard Nixon. ""American Rhapsody"", however, is a cut-and-paste offering with selections from Hollywood Confidential and The Starr Report, that anyone could construct, leading one to wonder if satire has become reality. How can anyone be expected to top ""...it depends on what the definition of 'is' is"" and ""...about the diameter of a quarter.""? Of course Eszterhas does not seek to ridicule the president, he seeks to praise him...by muddying the waters with an inappropriate literary engine having the opposite effect on the reader. He should be reminded of what Mark Twain once said: ""That which is satirized is loathed."""
4,Delicious,"If you are a very sensitive person, you may find it difficult to finish this book. It has no real plot, just chapter after delicious chapter of fun facts and excellent writing about politics and the dirty tricks and underwear of those we elect to serve.Maybe the premise of this book is ""Men are Pigs."" I agree with some of the reviewers that this book makes you want to take a shower; however, I did find it fascinating and fun to read, particularly the ""fictional"" chapters where Mr. Esterhas has his way with everybody. What a hoot.This is a fun book. You will find yourself wanting to read selected portions to others."
1,Eszterhas has plenty to say to defend Clinton,"Mr Eszterhas has plenty to say about all the intrigues in the Clinto administration. Typical of a left wing zealot nothing must get in the way of supporting your left wing buddies even if they are criminals. Eszterhas supports clinton because he is one of ""us"" he says. He likes what Clinton has done for the country. Mr Eszterhas likes people, wants to help them, and wants to see government helping people. In other words he a a do gooding Liberal from the 60's mold. If Mr Eszterhas is so so pure, how can he support a president that bombed a foreign country because he wanted to take the heat from himself. This Eszterhas seems to gloss over. Somali people were killed because a murderous thug lobbed a few missilies at defenceless people. I find the liberal mind fasinating. I hope to read more books by this author to get a few more good laughs."
1,Yellow Journalism,"Mr. Eszterhas has managed to trash not only the people in the White House but in Hollywood as well. Page after page of gossip tidbits and name dropping until the mind becomes numbed. In the end, none of the ""stunning expose's"" in this book were really interesting or necessary. Mr. Eszterhas may have used a fact checker but he certainly did not use a good taste meter. Most of the material in this book was suitable at best for the Jerry Springer show or the National Enquirer."
3,An overview of the Weimar Republic.,"Like the previous reviewer, this is an overview from several people's perspectives on the German Republic after William II and before Adolf Hitler. Some parts of the book are interesting, but some are just boring--especially relating to the cultural and sexual revolution in Germany. This is not an in depth study, so really it is just the cited sources perspective which could be right or wrong.De Jonge is a great author and his book on Rasputin flowed really well. This book did not flow as well, but there is interesting material in here. Those people's perspectives count in why Hitler rose to power. The violence of Weimar as described in the book was a fairly new perspective.A worthwhile, short read on the Weimar Republic."
1,Not very impressed,"I was really excited to get this book but unfortunately I was not very impressed with it's recipes. All the recipes were in metric which is not a big deal because it is not hard to convert. Some of the ingredients I have never heard of though and doubt that I could get them in an American grocery store. Besides that, the actual recipes themselves didn't really seem to be all that great anyways. I ordered 660 Curries along with this book which I highly recommend. All the recipes in that book look great and the author explains things very well along with having a sense of humor. I will be returning the Curry Bible to Amazon."
5,Looking for Pond's,"I love this form of cold cream/deep cleanser/make-up remover. The only problem is finding the stuff in my local stores. I've only found it at Kroger's grocery store. None of our pharmacies carries it (CVS or Walgreens). What's the deal? Why don't they carry it. It's great stuff and NON-GREASY and takes make-up off fast and easy and you don't have to dig down into a JAR. I hate jars. The tube is easy, portable and WORKS for everything I want a cold cream/cleanser to do. And leaves your skin clean and soft. It's great stuff."
4,it is very good,it is really very good and i like it except for one thing; the batteries stopped working after maybe two weeks so please be careful with this other than that it is very good.
1,Not totally satisfied,"The plastic edges are not sealed properly and unless you have wee-wee pad weights to hold them down, expect your puppy/dog to have fun tearing at its edges with their teeth. The padding itself is not as thick compared to other brands, and the smell is unbearable (I find I have to throw them away in the evening of the same day). They remind me of the ""economy"" pads."
5,Excellent TV,"After much research, decided on this TV. Amazon had the best price ($300 less than Circuit City and Sears). Shipment arrived on schedule and TV is amazing. Love the black cabinet color. Cable Card worked, but much slower at changing channels than the HD Cable Box so am not using it."
2,Slow Channel Changing,"I originally bought this set because of the glowing reviews I read. The picture quality is excellent and the set itself is most attractive. The big problem in my household is the amount of time it takes for the channels to change. When switching from one channel to another it takes as much as 6 seconds to complete the change. Since we're channel surfers, this is completely unacceptable and I intend to replace the set soon (after 6 months). I called Sharp about the problem and they told me it was not something that could be fixed. Many people like to surf the channels and it is absolutely impossible with this set. Be warned!"
1,Great Picture (while it lasts!),"I usually don't bother writing reviews unless I find something that is exceptional. This is the rare one that happens to be exceptionally BAD.Just like several other posters, I had my Aquos for a few weeks then it died. Just the two leds flashing in some pattern. The repair man took three trips to fix it over a two week period. The warranty just expired last month and the *!#@$#%& thing is just flashing leds again.Judging from a quick Google search, If you get one that dies in the first month - exchange it - quick!"
2,Be careful...,"I had assumed I was going to get my set professionally calibrated after I bought it, like I had done with my last TV. Sharp, however, has deleted the picture controls necessary for calibration, so the best picture you can possibly get by ""knob twiddling"" is far inferior to what can be produced by almost any other set. Sharp, of course, does not mention this in their literature, and none of the reviews that steered me towards this set in the first place mentioned it either. If you absolutely love the picture as you see it in the store, then go for it. But remember, the lighting and power conditions in your living room are not the same as in the store. The best I can do with the rudimentary controls Sharp supplies is a choice between slightly green faces and slightly pink ones."
4,a small difficulty,"This item needs to be adjusted to one's location before using it reliably. It must be calibrated first by setting it to a N-S-E-W direction [using a street map for the definitive directions] and the globe adjusted if there is any deviation. This accuracy is good, but the difficulty is in knowing WHERE exactly N-S-E-W is in the first place, as that is what a compass is for. Other than this small hassle, it seems to be well made."
1,POOR!,"This book is extremely poor and unclear. I would not recommand it to anyone, from beginner to software engineer."
5,My wife loves this flashlight,My wife thinks this flashlight is the most awesome thing. I'm glad I bought it for her. She uses it to feel safe when I'm not home.
5,Still going strong.,"Not much needs to be said, a fantastic light that has served me for years. It just got to be time to replace a very old one. I stand by the traditional bulb for the same reason I recommend the 3 cell over the 2 cell, they're better if you need to crack somebody in the skull."
5,Great service!,This was shipped promptly and arrived within the order guidelines. It was for a friend to bring to his brother who is working a security detail overseas.
2,worked while it lasted,maglite name used to stand for quality flashlights. i purchased 2 cell C & D flashlights and they only lasted for a year. i suppose for 15 dollars that isn't bad. Still i would rather not have to replace them with anything from mag intruments
2,"Solid, but there are better alternatives","While it is a solid, durable, and bright light, it has several big disadvantages. For one, the light output drops off way too fast. It has an impressive beam with fresh batteries, but after relatively short use, it's too dim to justify the enormous size and weight of the thing. Many lights, such as the modestly priced Surefire G2 pack just as much light output (or more) but are easily pocketable and much much lighter. Also, the smoooth plastic reflector gives it a dirty, spotty beam with noticible dark spots.Really, the only thing this light has going for is that it is a pretty indimidating body and has a definite macho appeal. But if your looking for serious illumunition look somewhere else."
2,Not as good as everyone thinks....,"When everyone says mag lights are ""top of the line"" they are being incredibly naive! Try looking into some real flashlights like Surefire, Fenix, and Huntlight! Mag lights even measure in candlepower, which grossly exaggerates brightness too. You turn them on and they're bright, but in 10 minutes it'll get dimmer. I own a flashlight by Fenix which is easily 5 times as bright as this and will fit in the palm of my hand! Before you buy this light, consider the p1dCE by Fenix, or the G2 from Surefire. Thank you!"
1,Paperweight,I expected more from this light having purchased many of Streamlight's excellent products.The so-called beam is ringy and irregular and the bulbs dont last very long.Too many other modern lights available that are a quarter of the size and weight that easily out perform the Mag Instument line.
2,Disappointed,I thought I bought a very powerfull flashlight but I was very disappointed. I have a 3-D cell flashlight that is better.
3,"Low output, high quality","*This flashlight was only useful to me after fitting a third party LED driver & heatsink*I live on a rural property with horses and needed a flashlight that would be 100% reliable if it was needed in an emergency, including being water and shock resistant. I was also after a flashlight that was able to be used for spotting objects from a distance. The amount of light this Maglite puts out in standard form is very disappointing and was not useful for anything I needed it to do. I fitted a third party Malkoff LED drop-in that replaced the standard bulb assembly and it transformed this light from lame to spectacular.Everything else about the Maglite though is brilliant: I value the high build quality, size, weather sealing and the simple on/off switch. This is why the 2D Maglite was the flashlight I chose to modify."
3,Outdated but still worth owning,"Yes, you can buy smaller and lighter flashlighs that put out more light and have longer battery life. But...if you are looking for something that is built like a tank AND produces a decent amount of light, then I recommend getting one.I keep one in my car and one around the house. It is what I carry when taking a walk at night. The Surefire on my belt puts out a lot of light, but you would be hard pressed to fend off a dog attack with one."
3,Strange Package,I ordered a flashlight for Father's Day and expecting it in a new package like the MAGLITE C Cell flashlight I ordered but it was wrapped in newspaper. The piece that detachs at the bottom was in an old ziploc bag. The flashlight looked pretty new but I've never received a package like that. I will be ordering another flashlight soon but I wonder how its going to be packaged.
3,"good light, but not great","This is the great flashlight for the cost. It's very bright, and the focusing beam is very useful. They claim it's waterproof. I dropped mine in water and it still works, kind-of. It's very dim and practically useless. Granted, it sat in the water for about 5 minutes, and it had a pH of 11, so I think it went beyond the intended exposure. It'll last forever in your garage, but if you're buying it for industrial uses, don't expect it to last forever."
3,my experience,its a graat torch very powerful bulb good focus but the only issue s that due to 4 batteries of A makes it very difficult to carry due to the weigt of 4 cells for residence purpose the 2 cell would be more confortable reg yusuf
3,Not a really bright light,The lighting is not as bright as I thought. Inova flashlights are smaller and brighter. The casing however is pretty strong and long lasting. So yeah I guess its a pretty good deal considering its price.
5,Must have if you are a flashlight lover and a prepper!!!,"The truth is that this is not only a flashlight, but also you can use it to defend yourself and your family. The conversion kit to LED are optional but I recommend it (is not a huge difference in the quantity of light, but the beam reaches further).La verdad es que esta no es solamente una linterna, sino que la puedes usar para defenderte a tí y a tu familia; El kit que la convierte a LED es opcional pero yo lo recomiendo (No es una gran diferencia en la cantidad de luz, pero el haz que proyecta llega mas lejos y es mas nítido)"
5,"Great light, well worth the price.","I carried a mag-light with me for a good many years while driving truck. A truck cab is probably one of the hardest places there is on flashlights,they never seem to last yet I never had a problem with the mag-lightOnce in a truck stop I saw a driver set his mag light on a tire and forget it was there, when he started to move the truck the light fell off and was ran over by the tire. When he realized what he had done he stopped and picked up the light and it was still working. Any other flashlight would have been flattened. If nothing else this made a believer out of me."
3,"It's an okay flashlight, better defense weapon","I bought the 4-D Cell Flashlight for more of a defense weapon than a flashlight. I leave it by my bedside so its always close by. I did use it quite a bit during the Hurricane Sandy power outages and I was not impressed with its output compared to the 3-D LED Mag-Lite I had also purchased. This thing ate through the batteries very quickly, and the light output was yellow compared to the LED light. Unfortunately, I cannot even upgrade this to an LED with the TerraLux conversion because Maglite changed the design of these. Spend the extra couple of bucks and get the LED version. You'll save the money on the back-end with battery costs."
5,amazing !! !,This Flashlight is extremely strong enough to fight with it can be considered as a weapon. In fact i like it soO much as i bought this item and the red one also. Recommend
5,amazing !! !,This Flashlight is extremely strong enough to fight with it can be considered as a weapon. In fact i like it soO much as i bought this item and the black one also. Recommend
5,Weapon of Choice,"As always Maglite is the best. Especially when priced like this. Thank you for that. The actual weight of this flashlight with 6 copper-tops is about 2 or 3 pounds. So it is probably too long and heavy for close quarter mechanic type work. But for those of us that need an unofficial ""weapon"" on the job, this more than fits the bill. I hope to get the glass break tip soon."
3,Get a 3D LED Maglite instead for only 5 more dollars!,"I personally don't have one of these (although I have used other people's) but have an LED 3D Maglite.It makes no sense to pay $20 for an antique incandescent 3D Maglite when you can get an LED version right here on amazon for only $25!The LED is brighter, around 10 times as energy efficient and has no filament to break from impacts or turning it on and off a lot.The only reason to buy this old light is if you want to use it as a heater!Mag-Lite ST3D016 3-D Cell LED Flashlight, Black"
4,"Really Bright, But Too Big & Heavy","This is really a bright flashlight. A classic Maglite product. Made from aircraft aluminum. It is really rugged that it became an issue with the LAPD for using them as a melee weapon. Wife does not want to touch it, it is heavy like a sledgehammer.Pros:-It is blinding bright.-Adjustable beam spread by twisting the head, which is also serves as the on and off switch.-Well constructed in every detail.-Water resistant-It even includes a spare lamp inside the tail cap (under the spring).-Reasonable priceCons:-Uses 4 ""D"" batteries that makes it so heavy and big. It is a struggle to carry it unless you need it also as a weapon.-Maglites are somewhat overrated in my opinion."
4,Great light,"Great flashlight. A little large, but bright and very durable. Only disadvantage is that it cannot be upgraded to an LED; Mag only makes LEDs for up to 4D."
5,MAGLITE Heavy-Duty 4-D Cell Flashlight,I brought 3 of these flashlights and I am pleased with the quality of the merchandise. I would recommend this to my friends
1,"Age Old, technology, inefficient","These lights are old technology, and run inefficientyly. there are lights out there 1/4th the size and throw out 50 times more light."
1,Time has passed this by.,"A Mag is to a flashlight what a Hudson is to a car--a great product in its time, but not something you would go out and buy today if you wanted to take advantage of what new technology has to offer. Instead, take a look at some of the new LED based flashlights, or the Xenon/LED combo lights made by Streamlight (called ""TwinTask""). For most purposes you will get vastly increased battery life and a much better white flood light (while using the LED's) and and with the TwinTasks still have the option of a high grade incandescent light for the times when you need more ""throw""."
1,Maglite QC has slipped,"I have purchased maglights for over 30 years, but the 2 I bouhgt here recently were pure garbage. Both, within a matter of days, lost the button cover, both swelled up with new, EXPENSIVE batteries and would not work. I am qualified to state this because I have a radio Amatuer, EXTRA class, KE5LDO, for many years, and this has never happened before even in the hot sun! Because they were inside an air conditioned room I would not expect either problem to happen. I saved the bulb, end caps, and the Hoods in case I am ever givien one. I will NOT be buying them again!"
4,"As a Brit might say: ""This is one bloody-good torch""!","Dear Sirs & Madams:Re: 4D-Cell MAG HVY-DUTY FLASHLIGHTThis is perhaps the best of all ""torches"" available, and at a bloody-good price...I am certain that not only the Yanks use these lites, but Scotland Yard AND OTHERS must also as well. Not only does this top-drawer product provide the light sufficent for any night needs and/or exposure of deeds, but by its own heft, it is also quite a good headknoker (without damage... to the lite) should one require such in a pinch.This product's pros are also a part of its cons: It is bright-white light, it is well constructed, and it is durable. It is also large and heavy. At the same time this product does not put in harm's-way: an officer, a citizen, or a suspect.I would not want to be without my ole MAG-Torch if it will turn the trick, rather than fire-power: indeed you can jolly well take this conviction to the bank...indeed!"
5,FANTASTIC LIGHT!!!,"This thing is something else. I read other reviews and frankly I don`t know what some 3 starers were talking about. This light is BRIGHT. I mean it`s rediculuosly bright. I could care less about these so called LED lights. This is the Cadillac of flashlights. You would have to be a moron to want anything else for a light. This thing is so strong you could use it as a hammer if you wanted to. It`s waterproof rubber seals work great. I woulkdn`t trade this for a LED light if you paid me. Besides, you can order an LED set-up for these lights if LED is what you want. Why not get the BEST, get a Maglight! I highly recommend this company. Thanks for a great light."
5,A must item for any woman living on her own,"My parents gave me one of these (stamped with the Boeing logo-must have been a freebie) when I moved out. Not so much for the giant amount of light it emits making it good for rolling black-outs. Rather, they gave me one so that I might be able to quickly subdue any intruder. Zombies, rapists, thugs, and thieves, BEWARE! The heavy over a foot long weapon would stop anything in it's tracks.Thankfully I have not had to use it as a deadly weapon. It's served me well through many a blackout, and I imagine would make me a freeze-tag champion if my neighbors were more fun."
3,"STUPID, CHEAP AND JUST INSANE!",ok this review is on the FAT ETHEL CRIMINALLY INSANE films..The first one didn't look like a home video but the second one did..Ok just think of this.. a realy fat woman in a night gown goin' nuts eatin' chocolate pudding and killing people who dont' want her to eat..end of story.. can't even remember how these films.. not sure if I watched all of eitherPretty sure they used red finger paint for blood..and I specifically remember an insne scene in the second one (home video looking one) where Fat ETHEL was just sorta dancing around her front yard with a butcher knife all MAMA CASS style laughing for like ten minutes and then dropping the bloody knife into the ground.. and laughing at it.. that may be when I shut off the video!BUT.. for some odd strange reason I still liked it all..kinda like the spice girls.. no one wants to admit they liked them but they did.. don't lie.. you liked it! :)So hit the crack pipe and enjoy..
3,You get what you pay for.,"First off let me start out by saying I gave this 3 stars but that does not include everything.Lenses: They work but don't expect real sharp images.Filters: These work great, I use them all the time.Batteries and charger: work great and last a lot longer than normal batteries.XD Card: Was really happy that it was an actual Olympus card and works great.XD Card reader: Works great.Camera Bag: Great little bag and holds everything.Tripod: one of the adjuster screws was stripped right out of the box and is basically worthless, though the little tripod works like it should.Cleaning kit: Cheap little kit but is a nice thing to have in the bag.I pretty much bought the kit for the batteries and the XD card and was happy it came with other things. If you went out and bought a charger, batteries, an XD card and reader you would be close to the price of this kit anyway."
3,Reasonable not more,After reading through the first couple of chapter you get the feeling that the writer didn't enjoy her stay in Orlando. Instead of providing more helpful information to the reader it seems that the author is focused more on sarcasm and snotty remarks. Still the book is an okay guide nothing more !
1,Disappointment,"I am from the LA area and was home sick the day the shootout went down. I was so glad I didn't go to school that day because that shootout was one of the most amazing events I had seen in my life. I went in search to find a video that would capture the events and let me re-live those 44 minutes over and over again. When I found this video, I immediately purchased it. Looking back I wish I hadn't. The only good part about the video is the cleverly designed box it comes in with some decent pics and a couple of bullet holes. The entire film looked like it was shot with a video camera, and the sound isn't all that great. Most of the video is talk about what happened, and very little visual documentary. In the end, you are better off watching an episode of Cops."
1,A typically exploitative video production.,"... There ain't much here. About the only worthwhile footage in the whole tape is that of one bad guy shooting himself in the head (as filmed from an overhead helicopter). The source footage for the video looks to be in pretty bad shape, as the color fades in and out throughout the tape. And the badly dubbed-in and out-of-sync gunshots don't help. Obviously all the production money was spent on the box cover (riddled with realistic-looking bullet holes!) and the ""reenactment"" of the bad guys loading up their weapons.If you can get it as an inexpensive ""favorites"" rental at your local shop or library, that might be an option. But don't even think about paying full price. (Sorry, Amazon!)"
2,Distorted sound: Loudness War!,"This could have been a fantastic collection, because the full, obscure to many, ""Reflection"" album made with Vangelis is featured here.Unfortunately the mastering for this disc set has been done aggressively in a bad way, especially the Reflection tracks sound distorted at their full loudness.It's a pity, these were the last recordings to sacrifice on the loudness battlefield; mission failed, Universal...."
4,Great Daily Devotional,"I enjoy reading this devotional. It's unlike many that I've read before. I would recommend this to every working person, regardless of your denomination."
2,bad fit,"I bought these for my o6 Kia Sorento, they fit the back door windows ok,the front doors they seemed to be longer than they had to be. I did not like the fit or look, plus they were not streamline to the window likethe set I ended up with."
4,Ranga Tabla Trail,"I bought Ranga's first album after listening to the first track at a CD store in KL one morning and it remains one of my all time favorites, so I had been looking for the next album for a while. Initially I was not as moved as I had been with Radient Awakening even though there were some great tracks. It wasn't until I gave it a listen on good sound system a few times that it really began to grow on me. It is a wonderful ambient soundtrack that grows on you with repreated listening. I would urge folks to listen to the last track loud and on a good system. I look forward to the next album!"
3,mixed,"It's a great workout as I'd heard, but she is the worst instructor. Would be great if someone could narrate while she is demonstrating the moves, as she whispers or does not instruct at all. But my legs and arms were burning and the more I do it, the easier it is to follow along and catch the changes..."
2,not worth it,"I hear so much about Tracy Anderson and I own a lot of fitness DVDs, but I was disappointed. I think she has a great body and G. paltrow speaks so highly of her, maybe my expectations were too high.She doesn't give the right amount of instruction-you constantly have to watch the screen to know what she is doing as she moves to the next move or changes it without any verbal clues. She has very odd facial expressions and bashes people with muscular bodies, saying things like women don't look good with six-pack abs. Hmm, good to know what you think, but not helpful in my life! I do 3-4 DVDs per week, I rarely pull this one out more than once a month. I only do because it was so expensive and I figure I must be missing something! I wish I had gotten a ballet conditiion tape instead-her moves seem to be based of that, but it is not an effective DVD."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. As other reviewers have mentioned, Tracy gives very few verbal ques and simply moves from one sequence to another. The moves themselves are basic, dance-based moves and very repetitive. Her demeanor is also very strange: her expression is self-absorbed and awkward. The result is one very boring DVD. I felt like I needed to read a book while doing this, it was so tedious and low energy. Yikes..."
1,Disappointing...,"Maybe the third time would have been the charm, but after my second Tracy Anderson Method dvd wouldn't play I gave up and asked for a refund. I can't rate the exercise program, because neither one of the dvd's they sent would play correctly. I will say that the seller was always extremely prompt in responding, quickly got my replacement out and then immediately refunded my money."
1,Received damaged DVD - was refunded,"I ordered this DVD and recieved a scratched one that did not work, but the company quickly responded and refunded my money. Good customer service, but unfortunately the product was not satisfactory."
2,88 Complete Collection,"I had wanted to check out a military themed animated show that employed fighter jets, and I had checked Area 88 out on a recommendation.The military fighter jets were kick azz, let me state that right away. The air combat was well done. The characters? A bit stiff. The storyline? Can't go wrong with the lost love plot, but it's nothing viewers haven't seen before.Area 88 isn't something I'm interested in watching again -- a bit boring all around, and not something that would entice me to watch again. I also wouldn't pay the $40 price for the set; the pricing should be more towards $30.The DVD's are an okay anime offering, with a classic storyline and modern military fighters. Again, the characters are a bit stiff, so be warned."
5,New season rocks!!!,Better than I thought it would be as I wasn't feeling too good about hearing that Lauren Lee Smith (Emma) was no longer in the show. But I was surprised by how good Karen Cliche (Lexa) was replacing Lauren.Her character Lexa has the ability to bind light or something like that. She is stunningly beautiful and amazing. Plus the storylines were a lot better than the other 2 seasons funny enough and too bad that this would be the last season. It ended with some unfinished business in the final story (not telling the ending!) Many questions need to be asked.I really hope 1 day they will get back to make a Mutant X movie in order to finish the story off
2,You get what you pay for!,"If ever there was a case for ""you get what you pay for, this is it"". The cooker lid does not fit snugly and rice/sticky steam lands all over the place. The directions are shakey, at best. They don't even include a spoon for their ""non-stick"" surface.Furthermore, no warmer function which leads to soggy rice.Be smart, pay the extra money, and go with the Zogirushi (sp?) brand. I had it before ($69.99) and it was perfect!!Great radios but pass on this appliance."
1,Pre-soaking required,"I wanted a simple, small rice cooker, but I didn't realize until I got this home that it required that you soak the rice for 30 minutes before you start the cooker. It's a big waste of time. The one and only pot of rice we made in ours came out undercooked and chewy, too, despite the pre-soaking.I'm very disappointed."
5,"Excellent product, Great price...","Since we do eat alot of rice, and I find cooking rice on the stovetop a pain, I decided to purchase this rice cooker. I was skeptical at first because I didn't want another useless appliance taking up space in our tiny kitchen...but I read the reviews on this one and decided to just buy it. I had never used one and I wanted something easy to use, not too big, and not expensive. I am VERY pleased with this rice cooker. It is small, yet cooks plenty of rice, it is a cinch to use (only one button), and the price is right. I also did the 1 cup rice to 2 cups water as the other reviewer stated and the rice came out PERFECT...I didn't even soak the rice like it says to do and the rice was still great. I will never cook rice on the stovetop again!"
4,Great Rice Cooker,"I received this as a gift from my mother and I love it. I wanted a rice cooker for so long, but I didn't want to spend $100 for one. This cooker makes my short California Sushi Rice, Jasmine Rice, and Basmati Rice. I have not tried plain brown or white, but I believe it would work just as well.It doesn't do that well as a vegetable steamer. Very small basket, could hold maybe one vegetable?"
2,Not Impressed,"This little cooker should have been exactly what I wanted. It is small, with just enough capacity for two or three servings, and does a fairly good job of not under/overcooking the rice. However, and this is the most disappointing aspect of the cooker and the reason it only gets two stars from me, the lid doesn't fit tightly AT ALL. As a result, even with only one cup (!!) of water in the bottom of the cooker, the rice and water boil over and bubble everywhere, creating a sticky, hot, ricy film over everything within eighteen inches' radius of the cooker. Definitely dangerous if there happen to be children exploring the counter, or if you are close and not paying attention. I have rectified it by wrapping the perimeter of the lid with wet paper towels to make a tighter seal, but I would not recommend this cooker to anyone who isn't fond of ""fixing"" brand-new appliances."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I agree with the other reviews that the instructions that came with the device are incorrect with regard to the water:rice ratio. Furthermore, as noted already by others, the lid does not fit snugly and the water will bubble up and out if you have it even half full. I did find that if I presoaked the rice it would not tend to bubble over as much, but who wants to presoak the rice for 30 minutes prior to cooking? After you add in the cooking time, it would be faster just cooking it on the top of the stove. But if you do presoak the rice and don't put that much in the device, it will turn out nicely cooked rice. I'm getting rid of mine, however, and getting something else."
3,Pretty Good,This is a Pretty Good Record.Good Up-tempo Material&What have you.it Reminds me of a Cross Between The O'Jays&Taveras.I Hear Elements of Both those Groups here.it has Good Party Type Jams on it.you Hear alot of Different Groups thru Double Exposure.
5,Great History,"The Three Famous Voyages of Captain James Cook round the world, narrating his Discoveries and adventures - together with the account of his murder at Hawaii and the subsequent voyage of Captain King to Kamtschatka, Japan, and China. Numerous Full-page Illustrations and Engravings in the text along with fold out maps."
3,The bottom fell out,"This baby bank is beautiful, and the Swarovski Teddy Bear adds a nice touch. However, after only a few days, the ENTIRE bottom of the bank fell off. It must not come from the factory with enough glue, because it took several attempts to glue it back on. For the price, I expected better quality."
1,This screens motor gears broke within 5 months,Elite Screens are very cheaply made... I bought the Cinetension 2 and only after 5 months the screen gears had let go and the screen came unrolling out of the case.The materal is very thin and the tension string does not really do anything.Very Poor design.... DO NOT BOUGHT FROM Elite Screens.Eric
5,Red Light Reader,I just purchased Passion for Your Purpose and could not put it down on the way home. I was in the car perusing a page at a red light and I could not stop reading. I did this at every red light all the way home. The words jumed off the page. I love it! I would highly recommend this book for the real people in the world who want peace and direction. I feel empowered... someone finally heard and SAID what I felt!!! If you haven't bought it do so now.... you will be pleased! The author says so many things that I have thought and been afraid to say. Thank you for your willingness to share in such a personal way. It has been inspiring!
5,Passion for your Purpose,"After reading Passion for your Purpose, I began to hear God speak clearly to my heart. One of the first questions I began to ask myself is ""What do I want to be when I grow up"". The book ignited a fire under my feet. After going back and reminising on the thing(s) that excite me and bring true enjoyment to my life, without a shadow of a doubt, I was able to figure out before finishing the book what my God given purpose is. I made a committment that day that I would not leave this earth without having fulfilled God's will for my life. God created me uniquely to fulfill a purpose that would not only benefit me but it would also benefit others!!!!!"
5,The Secret To Freedom Is Following Your Purpose In Life,"Gloria Thomas-Anderson gives new meaning to freedom in her book ""Passion For Your Purpose."" She allows each reader to examine their heart to determine if he or she is full filing their ""TRUE"" purpose in life.Gloria teaches, if one would focus their attention upon what God has orchestrated..., one would not have time to focus upon anything that would detach them from their purpose...As a reader, ""Passion For Your Purpose"" gave me a clear vision that many people, family and friends, would try to hinder each other from living your purpose because they are miserable with their life. As we all know, ""Misery Loves Company.""In conclusion, if each reader would digest the words written, and develop a personal relationship with God to understand their purpose in life, one would experience a freedom that words can't explain."
3,Riding for America,Older video about competition equestion sports. There are newer ones and new ones out every year. It would be nice if Amazon carried them.
4,good quality,"It is bright stainless. Awesome finish. However, it is way much more bigger than a normal(regular) exhaust tip. This is the only thing not good, too big. The overall length is almost twice as long as a regular tip. In product description, they should place the product measurements."
1,don't buy from this seller!,"You don't want to buy from this seller. The boxed set is shipped directly from China and the quality is pathetic. There are episodes missing, some episodes will not even play, some are on a disk more than once under different titles. The list goes on and on. They skip. They came in pink plastic sleeves and nothing is properly labeled so you don't know what season or disk you are on. It was very disappointing. Pay a little extra and buy from a better seller."
5,Greatest comedy in a long time!,"I was introduced to The Office a few months ago through some friends. This show is brilliant, unique, fresh, and entertaining. All of the characters are funny in their own way, and once you get over the initial annoyance of Michael Scott you learn to love him too! The extras that are on seasons two and three are great. This is a great show that you can watch over and over again. I would recommend this show to anyone looking for a comedy that will keep you laughing and smiling time after time."
4,Amazing stories that vary widely across the spectrum of believability,"This set of ""Amazing But True"" stories is fairly typical of such collections. Most of them deal with situations such as unusual coincidences, amazing rescues and the origins of celebrations we now take for granted. However, there are a few that are of questionable veracity, for example a supposed Columbian man who lived to be 166 years of age. Another is the supposed five-year-old Indian girl who gave birth in a hospital in Lima, Peru.Nevertheless, if you are a fan of unusual stories that in general are true, then this is a book you will enjoy. Even though your level of disbelief may rise to a point over the ""I believe"" level."
3,what you would expect,"this is the music of the beatles played by some symphony no-one's ever heard of, pretty ho hum, not bad but not good. if you have a desire to hear the songs of the beatles symphonically you might as well pick this up, its not a bad price for a 3 cd set"
1,Save your money! Don't buy!! Can barely hear. No volume!!,I bought this to use with my IPhone & Mp3 player. The problem is there is no volume adjustment & you can barely hear it. You have to use the volume on your mp3 or iPhone but the sound is louder if I just use my iPhone. Waste of money!!! Needs to have volume switch so you can make it louder!!! Volume was up all the way on both mp3 & iPhone. Still had to put my ear up to speaker to hear. Booooooo!
1,"SportBand with case for iPod Video, Microsoft Zune, & Creative Zen Vision: M - Navy Blue","SportBand with case for iPod Video, Microsoft Zune, & Creative Zen Vision: M - Navy Blue is a no good. This product created so much interferrance when I was running my half marathon. I had to get rid of it. I do not recommend this product to anyone who is a good runner."
1,Not happy with item,"Bad finish, the velcro at the end of the strap is in both sides so its really unconfortable to wear."
2,"Works, but not for very long. Good product but buyer beware.","I purchased this product for use while I run. The first set back is the product will not stay on my arm. It slips down after about 5 minutes of jogging. No matter how tight I strap on it. If I put it on my jacket rather than my arm, I get better results.After about 4 months of use however, the stitching is coming apart and I've finally decided to search for a new version. The new problem is, I am unable to find another product out there that works any better..."
1,Broke the third time i used it,"The case was too small, barely fit and broke the third time i took it to the gym. Your better off getting the skin case for the zune that was made for it."
4,Better than I expected...,I ordered this product to hold my 30 GB iPod video while I run. It fulfills ts purpose beautifully. It is a good size and easy to use. My only complaint would be that it pinches my arm a little when I don't put it over a shirt. I have to place it on my arm where it won't slide off or hurt when I flex... But it works well...
5,Good for what it's for,"I like it, my phone (blackberry sized), as well as an i- touch fit in fine and were pretty secure with the strap. Arm band might be too small for larger built males."
2,Doesn't fit the Creative Zen Xtra,"This was one of the only armbands that I found that claimed to fit the Creative Zen Xtra. After I got it in the mail, I quickly discovered that the armband is not wide enough to fit the Creative Zen Xtra."
5,A great holder...,"Although it is not really designed for a 4th generation IPOD ( had to put a hole in it for the head phones), I would say its fit and style outweighs any problems I have had..."
5,A lotus in a pond of murky water.,"As a Vietnamese reader, this book is a precious one about a dark period of our country's history. Ms. Fitzgerald says for us what we've tried to say that American values differ from Vietnamese values. As one wise man said: The West has democracy and liberty, the East has morality and honor. People who disagree with this book are obviously still under the murky water of ignorance."
4,"A little verbose, but well thought out work.","FitzGerald does write more than she needs to.Her book is NOT just mindlessly bashing against the U.S. , but instead a view of the war from the Vietnamese perspective. Her insights on Vietnamese culture are interesting, if a bit too drawn out. Her book makes it painfully obvious that U.S. intervention in Vietnam was wrong."
2,An exceptionally biased history of the US/Vietnam War,"Not a useless book, but close. This book is so obviously slanted against the United States that anyone trying to find the truth of the US involvement in Vietnam will be quickly put off. This book is very close to the viewpoint expressed by Noam Chomsky that the US involvement in Vietnam was calculatingly genocidal. This was one of the earliest comprehensive histories of the war. As such it has NOT aged well."
2,SCC Second Album,"This is alot better than First Hand but it still seems to be lacking something. Good Lyrics just nothin really stands out to me. Standout song would be the praise ballad ""His Strength is Perfect."" An OK album."
5,"Great price, great product.","Our old ones were decaying and cracked, dropped these right into our bbq along with 3 new burners and we have a virtually brand new bbq. I like the ceramic flame tamers better that the metal because they hold the heat longer/steadier."
2,use them only for what models they're specified for,I purchased 6 of these ceramic flame tamers for another grill application. Unfortunately 3 have broken after 2 hours use because they are so brittle. I'm sure they work perfectly for their designed application.
4,no more flare ups!,"These were larger than my original tiles but six new ones filled the space of the nine old one so it worked out fine. These work great, virtually no flare ups. They do seem to take a while to conduct the heat to the food so everything is taking long than before but at least they are not burnt!"
5,OMG it works!,"Medicine tablets and cats never ever mix. The vets making a med tablet should have made it tasting and smelling fish or chicken. Wasted 2 tables of deworming pill tried couple of times by pulverizing 1/4th of the pill w/a mortar and pestle, mixing w/ very high end wet food and even adding tuna fish flakes, but no success. I even tried to starve her just she would eat anything I would serve. I guess Sophie my cat would rather go hungry than eat food laced with medicine. After almost giving up a friend mentioned this to me. I 1st tried to feed her 1 pill pocket w/o a med that worked, then I fed her another pill pocket w/1 pill inside. OMG success! I felt so happy. Plus Amazon's is cheaper than pet store."
4,Good product and good price,"If you have to give your cat pills alot this product will save you alot of hassles. It is a very soft treat with a hole in it and you just drop the pill in it and feed it to the cat. My finicky cat also readily eats it. Also, if your cat is taking an antibiotic, these pill pockets have a probiotic in them that is good for the cat.I used to just put a pill in a soft cat treat but, I have not found a cat treat that is easy to jam a pill into because they are too dry or not soft enough. The only complaint I have is, the last batch I ordered were kind of smushed together and some were broken apart.The Amazon price is good too. Some sites sell this for alot more."
1,It really depends on your cats.,My cats wouldn't even touch them. They just pawed them around a bit. Too bad it's a non-returnable item. Good luck.
5,Greenies Pill Pockets,"They are so easy to use since I have to give him a pill twice a day. Besides, my cat really likes them."
2,Useless,"Maybe some cats like these, but mine want nothing to do with them. I think part of it is the extremely gummy texture. I definitely wasn't expecting that."
3,Great concept/didn't work for my cat.,"I have a cat that must be given a daily pill. It has been getting more and more difficult to struggle with him to take the pill, so I purchased these pill pockets hoping they would solve the problem. But, they only worked on my cat two times.The first time I put a pill inside one of the pill pockets and gave it to him---he ate it without a second thought! The second time I tried it on him, he thought about it for a minute...and he eventually ate it. Ever since then...he will pick it up in his mouth, but then spit it out!!! I don't know if it is because he doesn't like the texture of the pill pockets (they are kinda ""mushy"" and he is more of a ""crunchy"" treat eater), or maybe he senses that there is something inside? Or...maybe he doesn't like the flavor.Guess maybe I'll try a different flavor."
3,"attn: Tle old lady ""oldie"" from marietta, ga","my cat also has crf, and was interested in giving her pepcid ac in the pill pockets, as she fights me terribly w/ pilling. I was wondering what dosage you are giving your cat. I've read to quarter the 10mg tablets. Her poor stomach is so acidic, I can tell when she's across the room. Please contact me at kerryf316@earthlink.net if you would like to share. Thanks so much!"
2,Pill Pocket only worked twice,"Our cat is pretty mellow with the exception of taking pills. We tried pill pockets and it worked only twice. I was VERY, VERY careful with not contaminating the pill-pocket with the medicine taste. Cats, unlike dogs, are chewers, and once he chewed the medicine in the pill pocket, he stopped eat them altogether. Another time he ate around the pocket and left the pill! Later, I tried with just an empty pill pocket and he gulped that up! Arghh. I finally resorted to crushing the tablet and mixing it with a very small amount of baby food (ham or some kind of meat) and now I just smear it on the cat's teeth or put it directly inside his month (he won't eat the baby food with the meds otherwise). SUCCESS! Thank goodness we found a way to administer the pill, since our cat has to have a daily dose for 60 days!"
5,Looked just like the picture...,When I received the poster print I was very happy with the colors and then I just took it to Michael's Craft Store and had it framed to give as a gift. Arrived rolled in good shape with no bent corners but shipping did take a bit longer than I expected.
5,very original composition and melodies,"This small ostensibly obscure group of musicians is quite gifted. For several years now, this has simply been one of my favorite recordings. The cello and viola play is very moving and thoughtful and the melodies are pleasant and haunting. Though from Germany, their music clearly has an Asian influence that constitutes a blend of World, New Age and Classical elements; a combination that makes the music very unique but difficult to classify into any particular musical genre. I frequently wonder what happended this talented group of musicians."
2,Flimsy and slightly off on size,"The size of the rack mounts is slightly off because the case is somewhat flimsy and it has warped, I had to get help to pull the sides apart so that some rack mount items would fit."
1,cheap junk,Not sure where the quality was. not even an hour into painting the bristles began to fall off leaving themselves lodged into the paint on my walls... get what you pay for.... in this case junk. Not sure how anyone gave these 5 stars? maybe they just didn't notice them falling apart. Went to local hardware store and picked up better brushes and had no such problems.
2,cheaply made,These paint brushes do not paint very well and the bristles fall out easily. I would not recommend this product.
2,Don't bother....,"Crappy quality. The bristles came out the first, second, and last time I used them. I'm a Fine Art major and needed some basic big brushes to do a primer coat. I wish I would of just spent the extra bucks to buy better quality brushes that would last longer and not waste my time."
1,Babygirl,i love ranma 1/2! it's really the only anime i watch. im just starting on my collection ogf the series and found this particular purchase to be a mistake! ranma 1/2 is a great comody. until now i havn't found an episode i dislike. this dvd definatly falls short of any and all of my expectations. if you are a new ranma fan i would stay away from this one!!!
2,i love ranma!,im a big fan of the ranma 1/2 series and i hate to say that most of the episodes on this dvd were a major dissapointment. if you are new to ranma don't watch this one!!!
3,Free is good,"Not what I was expecting, but not bad. Had this book confused with another. Good for those interested in this sort of thing."
4,very nice,"nice for what i wanted it for. i wanted a peaceful, pleasant screen for my baby girl to watch. scenes arent exactly realistic looking but still nice."
4,"A Clear ""Introduction to Ballet""","Debra Maxwell teaches a small ballet class of grade-school children, one of whom is new to the class. She explains the terms and shows precisely how to move the arms and feet. The five basic positions are taught, as well as some barre work and center work. The video is, indeed, only a bare introduction, but it's a great joy for my 5 year old to use daily. I appreciate the teacher's attitude toward the children in the class, expecting good work, but still being supportive of their beginning efforts. Some brief segments of accomplished adult dancers are included."
3,Fun for my 5 year old.,Expected a little more instruction for the money. My 5 year old little girl does enjoy going over the steps.
1,don't waste your money....,"This book is repetitive and very poorly edited. The author states the same approach to cooking meat and chicken in different chapters. However, the chapters are almost identical, except for the words ""chicken"" or ""meat"". The science in the book is based on an ""unpublished paper"" by the author. Funding for the book was provided by a grant from a company for which she is the CEO/founder. This book is useless."
5,A very helpful guide,Having kidney failure means not being able to eat everything you use to because of waste build up in the blood. Following the instructions in this book when cooking meat can help reduce blood creatinine.
4,Austism Alternative to Fireworks,"Our family always loved fireworks so it was a huge disappointment when fireworks turned out to be a traumatic event for one of our children who has autism. We tried to balance the holiday and found this great DVD years ago. It spans years of American history with a little bit of everything AMERICAN (much like a collage of video to music) and has some wonderful footage of places and news. Great to reminisce!The fireworks display isn't the best but it is set to music (23 tunes of varying types: traditional, pioneer, etc.) and the DVD has a wonderful spirit which brought 3 generations of joy while watching. Perhaps younger generations could have used more information. (there are 23 tunes while you move through our American history and America."
5,Make sure you know how to use it !,"This is the best English course I have ever used.. I have been teaching English for 5 years and this helps with pronunciation, making sentences, grammar and vocabulary. It is interesting, fun, complete and a joy to work with. It's a shame it is discontinued as I wished to purchase again for my personal use.The person who gave a bad review did not graduate the speech recognition to his level. You have to read the instructions!"
2,"""What in hell are German teeth?"" asked Peter.","If that quote doesn't sound like Lord Peter to you, how about this quote from Lady Peter (Harriet Vane)? ""About your second concern, however, I cannot be so emollient.""There are really only two problems with this book: a weak plot and a tin ear for the way that Sayers' characters talk - as illustrated above. To be fair, there are some nice touches to the book. It's good to see the Bunters again, the background material on how WWII in England affected the daily life of the residents is excellent, and who can object to seeing Miss Twitterton finally married off - even if it is to an older Polish farmer.But the mystery is hardly mysterious. And the conversations between Lord and Lady Peter are painfully off key. Add a few improbable coincidences and some odd local color and the net result in not very satisfying, at least to this Sayers fan."
5,Sayers fans will appreciate this excellent forgery!,"Jill Paton Walsh does a superior job of creating an intriguing mystery while maintaining the charm and appeal of the Wimseys, et al. I don't buy many books in hard back, but this one was worth it."
3,"Better than ""Thrones Dominations""","Jill Patton Walsh once again adds to Agatha Christi's Lord Peter Whimsey/Harriet Vane series. She has done a better job on this book. If you have read ""Busmans Honeymoon"" you will meet a lot of familar characters.This story is set in the beginning of WWII, and Harriet has retreated to Talboys, the house where Peter and Harriet spent thier honeymoon. Ms. Walsh not only does a good job of expanding on the village residents introduced in ""Busmans Honeymoon"" she captures Ms Christi's style a lot better than in ""Thrones, Dominations"". She also does a good job of capturing the feeling of England at this very difficult time.Lord Peter does not appear until almost half way through, but Harriet keeps you attention until then.Despite what could be a very heavy setting, this story is lighted hearted where it is not inapprioate.Well worth buying. I hope Jill Patton Walsh does another story soon."
5,Wonderful book!,"As all of Dorothy Sayers books, this one has an excellent story-line and is written in majestic prose, as only she and her friends back then could produce."
1,Very much a letdown,"This book does not honor the Sayers canon. It is full of allusions to moments from other books, as if Walsh is trying to say ""See? I read then and know them! Trust me, I'm a fan!"" But Sayers hardly ever repeated herself. The book has more dialogue and less intelligent introspection and analysis than any Sayers book. The scene in which Harriet puts an exhausted Bunter to bed would NEVER happen that way; Harriet wouldn't violate the social contract. Bunter would never be that familar with Ruddle. Trapp is not likely to tolerate Ruddle. In a late scene, Bunter appears in two places at once. There is no attempt to use dialect or idiom to distinguish people from different backgrounds. Poorly written, and VERY poorly edited. Looks like a rush job. I hope she does not write another novel using Sayers' characters. It is a disservice to the fans."
3,What happened to Roger?,"One specific criticism: Walsh seems to have mixed up the Wimsey children Roger and Paul: in Sayers' story Talboys, set after this book, Bredon is six, Roger is four, and Paul is only briefly mentioned and strongly implied to be the youngest. Then somehow in Presumption of Death, Harriet has a three-year-old Bredon and . . . Paul. Harriet introduces him as ""her second son"" and Roger seems to have been completely skipped. I really don't understand how Walsh could clearly have done so much research and mimicked Sayers style so skillfully, yet overlooked something as basic as keeping her characters straight."
1,Presumption of Death,"I wish that Dorothy Sayers had written more Wimsey novels. However, I think it is a really bad idea for any writer to try and fill another writer's boots. Jill Walsh is not Dorothy Sayers. She should write her own books as Jill Walsh and stop trying to copy another writer's style. It will never ring true."
2,"Write as yourself, Jill!","A Presumption of Death: A New Lord Peter Wimsey/Harriet Vane MysteryThis is not Sayers and certainly not Lord Peter. Social relations are modeled on the year 2000, not 1940.,"
3,More detail needed,This novel was not as rich in the Sayeresque detail as other Sayers/Wimsey books. Thrones Dominations had more of the detail that makes Lord Peter such a joy. But this book does cover the war years and many families were separated and the flavor of life was reduced. Lord Peter's absence during much of the book reduces that flavor. I missed the familiar interaction the characterizes other Wimsey novels. It is still appropriate to the period and a pretty good Lord Peter tail is still better than many other authors at their best. I hope another try will be made; perhaps to chronical the Wimsey family in the post war era.
2,Glorified fanfic.,"Had this been posted on some fan's blog or webpage, I would have given it a very high rating. However, as a product of a professional writer, it is horrid.To satisfy your curiosity, check it out of the public library. Don't spend your money on it, though."
1,timequest took to much time,As a fan of time travel movies I thought the idea interesting of what would happen if the assaination of President Kennedy was thwarted. This movie was a big disappoinment. The acting was terrible. The script was really bad. I can't imagine them wasting money making this movie
1,Horrible movie,"This movie was a joke. I got it as a gift from a freind of mine, and I must say, it is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line was okay, a somewhat far fetched thought of what might have been had Kenneddy lived. However, the script was juvenille and poorly acted. The scenes jumped about and were hard to follow when watching for the first time. Random scenes, many including unneeded sexuality are thrown in for no reason at all. Most do not even fall into the plot. I would not recommend it to any one, even a die-hard science fiction fan."
1,I can't believe I watched this weird movie,"I really doubt if JFK was saved by a time traveler that the future would be what the writer(s) thought it would be.The VP under Robert Kennedy is Martin Luther King. The man playing the role looks and seems more like Jesse Jackson.These are just a few odd things thrown in this movie. Nobody looks like the famous people they are portraying. The closest is the woman playing Jackie Kennedy.Time travel is such a strange subject to try to guess what would happen. Personally, I see events happening or not happening on a more micro level. That even one ""insignificant"" soul missing can make a huge difference in the world. Think on a small level. One person can make a ripple effect on the world. Just by turning left instead of right. Think about it.This is a low budget movie. Only die hard Kennedy fans will love this movie."
1,Corny,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was syrupy and corny, almost embarrassing to watch."
5,What if JFK never died,excellent with the element of time line with this alternate reality The story is great for sci-fi and alternate reality movies
2,An Unintentional Comedy,"""Timequest"" had a potentially good concept involving a ""what if President Kennedy had never been assassinated"" plot line, but fails badly. The movie is terrible, with jerky, illogical, and hard-to-follow scene changes, laughable dialogue that wasn't intended to be laughable - all intermixed between otherwise boring filmmaking. The acting is mixed as well, with most of it achieving a level of mediocrity and no higher. One of the most hilarious scenes is with the ""man from the future"" who wears one of the most ridiculous ""space suits"" I've ever seen. No lie - it looked like a piece of crap. Still, it was good for a few laughs. In fact, the whole movie turned out to be an unintentional comedy, and that's how I ultimately viewed it. However, if you like good science fiction, this movie isn't it."
2,"Great idea, bad movie","man oh man. what a great premise, been done by some others too, but this one had such great potential... too bad it was very poorly executed. but, at least it was free - library borrow. i'd never pay to watch it!"
2,"Some good, some strange.","I gave this dvd as a gift and was told by the receiver that: the JFK what-if thing was cool, it was at times strangely presented, and the Bruce Campbell character was not in the movie that much. He (the gift receiver) is a huge Campbell fan! Passing on this movie is probably a good idea. I will watch it myself through Blockbuster-Online in the future."
3,Alternate universe,Well done film on what could have happened if JFK lived. Bruce Campbell is in a cameo as an Oliver Stone character.
4,"Good story, makes you think","In many respects this is a thoughtful, ""what if...?"" story; respectfully done. It postulates a different future had JFK not been assassinated in Dallas - and in some ways a better future. I dunno if that would have happened or not but this was a good faith effort. My only complaint is that there was gratuitous nudity that took away from the story so I'm dropping it one star - please, EITHER a thoughtful, well written story OR gratuitous nudity; you can't really mix them and get away with it.Highly recommended."
4,The Movie,"An incredible movie for who loves alternate history.I like it very much, also there aren't no famous actors.I hope there'd be more film about alternate history or uchronia.That's all folks"
5,Flying Cats,I have been very pleased with this soft-cover book from England. It provides a lot of detail about the use of the Catalina Flying Boat prior to and during WW II. The vendor shipped promptly and the well-packaged item arrived much earlier than anticipated.
1,Wrong picture and bad description,"I purchased these blades believing they were tungsten tipped blades, as the picture attached shows clearly teeth on the blade, And the description said tungsten carbide.No where has it said ""Carbide grit Blades"" as it clearly says on the packets once they were delivered. Misleading info and picture !!"
2,"Man, I'm so upset with misleading product specs on Amazon","Bought these for my newMilwaukee 2625-21CT M18 18-Volt Hackzall Cordless One-Handed Reciprocating Saw Kit. The spec DOES say for metal, and once I got the package it read not for metal. You need a diamond saw blade for cutting metal.Luckly the kit did include ONE bi-metal saw blade; and I was able to do the work I had bought it for."
3,Not bad.,"I have used numerous different e-commerce applications, and this is one of the more thourough versions that I have seen. Complete listing of unlimited items, graphic support, customizable templates, and much more is yours for a fraction of what an item with this many features usually runs. I would recommend this product to those who have a basic understanding of where they want their sites to go. A plan is a must with this product. A great way to get into e-commerce."
4,A Call to Follow Jesus,"This book is another in the ""Turn the Page and See"" series. The concept of asking a question on one page and finding the answer on the next is excellent for creating anticipation and review as you read stories to young children. This story is taken from the life of Jesus and gives a sequential account of the call to follow Jesus of the twelve apostles, and other significant New Testament characters. The book concludes with and opportunity for the reader or listener to respond with a personal committment to follow Jesus.The illustrations are colorful pictures set in scenes typical of New Testament times. Simple drawings portry joyful people in Bible time costume.The book is targeted to a four to eitght year old audience. I highly recommend this for grandparents, parents, and for Christian school and Sunday school resource libraries. I found a personal satisfaction each time I turned a page to discover I had come up with the right answer."
4,I saw myself in an ultimate light,"Glikerson's novel has shown me all sides of my personality. I am Bosun, Pilot, and Flags with a touch of Crew and a dash of Steward. Although this novel hasn't changed my life. It has shown me my foilbles in a very intriguing story which held me from the first strike. I am a sailor and I could feel the sea roll under me as I read of the Ultimate Voyage. The five are one in us all."
5,Excellent,"It is a very accurate, readable book, and does great service in clarifying concepts previously and otherwise mis-interpreted."
3,So-so used book,"Book has quite a bit of notes in it that the previous owner took, which sometimes mark through the text. Fortunately these were done in pencil, but I have to erase these marks to read the book. The description by the merchant didn't include any indication that the markings were this bad..."
1,"Dry, lifeless, scholary ignorant","A typical work of the many that arrogant scholars, without any meditative practice and experience are producing on Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu. It is pitiful and ironic that ego-inflated western scholars, most of them from ""reputed"" universities and therefore totally committed to academic correctedness (which is totally anti-Tao) attempt to interpret works that were written in a hightened state of conscioussness by Tao-men that had turned their backs to the sterile intellectuality of the status quo of their days.Don't waste your money on books produced by the new ""Taoist scholarship"" mafia, that come up with fanciful rationalistic theories only to impress their collegues and justify their salaries."
4,No need for a stereo system!!,"The sound on this tv is just that good. After receiving this item the day after I ordered it(Thank you Amazon!) I have done nothing but watch tv. I am watching HD through my cable company, so they get some of the credit here, but the picture is AMAZING.The black case on the TV makes it sleek and sporty looking, and will look great using the included pedestal mount, or hanging it on the wall is even better if you wish.Sharp added all the inputs that you could need on this tv. In my opinion, the HDMI is not worth the money, as you will not notice the difference in the picture quality using component cables, so save the hundred bucks.Overall, a great buy for an even better price. I can't find a single merchant that will sell this tv for less than or the same as what Amazon gave it away for. You will be thrilled beyond belief when you take this puppy out of the box. Don't let the small screen size fool you. Once you power it up, you are hooked forever!!!"
1,Service Shock,"As I recall, our 26"" AQUOS did have a gorgeous image for the first four months....August through November 2006. I haven't seen it in 6 weeks so it is hard to be enthusiastic. By December 13th, our AQUOS was in the shop --waiting for part after ""reconditioned"" part from Sharp. We spoke with Emily, Andre, Jordan, Patrick, Tammy, Cindy, Jamie, Serena, Angie, Ray,Lynelle, and Clarice's voice mail at the Sharp Service Center in Romeoville, IL.. We then sent two faxes. Two weeks ago, we were promised a replacement tv -- which we later learned will be a ""reconditioned"" set. We are about to pick that set up. We received no compensation and only the most glib apology.I am not sure what other warantees say, but I urge you to read the Sharp warranty with great care. Their service staff were friendly, but would not give us the name of a manager to contact for a month."
2,Caveat Emptor--Not such a great deal so far,"I ordered and recieved the Sharp Aquos 26"" LCD-TV. The reviews were highly positive so I thought that it was worth the risk of buying such an expensive product online. After setting up the TV I noticed a thin red vertical line on the left side of the LCD panel, at first unobtrusive but then more and more noticeable. I called Sharp and they referred me to a local tech repair store to have the TV looked at. When I called the repair store I was told that they did not know how to repair the BRAND NEW SET, and that they had emailed Sharp for instructions. The T.V. was delivered four days ago to my home; two days later it was in the shop; and now it will remain there until next week at the very least, I have been told. Not such a great deal after all."
1,picture freezes randomly,Very disappointed with this product. The TV freezes unexpectly from the very first day I brought it. Happens at LEAST once a day since. Only way to unfreeze is to pull the power cord. Controls (remote and on the set) become unresponsive when the freeze occurs. Requested Amazon to take the TV back.
2,All Sound is ... lost !,"Count me among the many who lost all sound, beginning 2 weeks ago after owning the set about 30 months, trouble-free. I solved the problem by hooking up my cable audio output to a small receiver with speakers, spending about $10 to buy a cable to convert audio cables to a stereo connector, at Radio Shack. I won't be buying another Sharp set after this disappointment."
1,Warning,I purchased this item in June of 2006. In August of 2007 -- 2 months after the warrantee ran out -- the sound went out. Do not recommend.
4,find a new cover girl!,"I am very happy with the Friends Forever books because they are more realistic than the old BSC. I have one complaint though. I am Japanese-American and I don't think the girl who is on the covers as Claudia is. I would guess she is Phillipina. It drives me crazy when people think all Asian-American people are interchangeable, like we won't notice. There *are* differences in the appearances of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Phillipinas, etc., if only you would stop to look."
1,Selena Guijosa review,"I do not recommend you read the Claudia Gets Her Guy. This book took me several chapters to get into the story. It did not hold my interest. If you are into love stories it may be a good book for, you to read.Once I was like half way into this book the action came in. it took me a long time to like it as much. I think it's not a good book. But you might like it"
5,A great book of short stories,This is a great compilation of stories. What makes it great is that they are not all the same. They jump from a murder mystery to a boxing story to a story of survival. Give it a try you probably won't be disappointed.
2,Didn't really help,"I am 20 years old and I still manage to get acne. Although this oil is advertised to immediately clear up your skin, I didn't see any changes at all. If you have acne that seems to be resistant to just about every product out there like mine then chances are this one won't work for you either."
5,Great oil,This oil is a wonder cure for all types of skin issues. It promotes healing and prevents infection. I have used it for a wound that would not heal (diabetes) and it closed up to the amazement of the doctor. Best price anywhere.
2,didn't work for my acne scars,I bought this after reading it would help fade acne scars. I've been using it every night for 2 weeks without any results. It actually made me break out :(
5,100% Tamanu,great product; have tried other Tamanu products but this one is 100%; what a difference and a little goes a real long way.
5,Healing Skin,"I listen watch the Dr. Oz show from time to time and learn many interesting and helpful solutions to every day problems with health, eating, lossing weight, etc. During the time that I learned about Pure Tamanu Oil, my facial skin had become very rough and scaly for no aparent reason. I did the same routine every day and 2 days a week sat in the gym's sauna. I purchased the oil, it arrived quicker than I thought and I have been using it on a daily basis. Within a few weeks I noticed a change. I continued to use my toner, and moisturer but I would incorporate Tamanu Oil with it. My face feel wonderful! I don't know why it got the way it was but I am glad I learned about this oil. It also has many other benefits and for best results per person, please do research. You learn more that what is said in an hour show, or page long article. Research is the key to better health! Thanks"
3,Mixed review,"I purchased this product after hearing great things. Although it is great for diminishing any kind of scars or blemishes, I had an allergic reaction after putting it all over my face. I might have put too much on, but it did clear up any sort of blemish scars i had"
4,Good product.,I've tried using this product a couple of times now. The only problem I have is that it takes quite a while for my skin to absorb the oil. So it makes my face look greasy when actually its taking a while to absorb. Overall its a great product.
3,Not 100% Tamanu,"I bought this product a few months ago and loved it. However, the Seller was out this go around and I had to order from another auction site.Wow, was I surprised at the difference! The newer product I received was much thicker, went on smoother, feels better and keeps my skin much softer.Once again, the Tamanu Oil I bought on Amazon was great but does not seem to be 100% tamanu oil. I advise any purchasers to shop around before buying from this Seller."
3,Where's the beef?,"I have dandruff that other potions haven't helped so Ihoped Tamanu might succeed where they had failed. Itspleasant smell was reassuring initially but generousapplications have served to merely smell up my pillowcases, not cure my dandruff. In fairness, why should Iexpect Tamanu to work on dandruff when that's not itsdefined purpose.Doomed to Dandruff"
1,CAREFUL - DId Not Receive 100% Tamanu oil,Thought I must have read the description wrong after the 3 bottles I ordered showed up.This product I received was Not 100% Tamanu oil. Instead it is a 1 OZ bottle that contains a half ounce of 100% Pure Tamanu oil and a half ounce of olive oil.Item came with a different label and was not as pictured or promised.
1,Tamanu Oil,"The product was sold as 100% Tamanu Oil, and it was labeled as such on the box, but on the bottle, the ingredients were listed as 50% Tamanu Oil, 50% Olive Oil, I contacted New Chapter Organics, the manufacturer, and I was informed that they only sell 100% Tamanu Oil in 1/2 ounce sizes. I contacted Amazon, and they immediately refunded my money. I'm a cautious on-line shopper, but I will do more and all with Amazon."
3,a very good cd,"This cd contains several of the best 90's dance tracks, even though most enthusiasts already have these songs its nice to have them on one cd."
3,This CD single is a major departure musically from the group's previous music,"With the release of the group's 13th CD single, TRF would continue to use the live house band music incorporated into their later music but now incorporate a 70's hippy-pop style, moreso in the music video for ""Love & Peace Forever"" than ""BRAND NEW TOMORROW"".The song was a major departure from their synth pop/dance club days and the latest song was very disco in feel and the move into this new direction was made by Komuro Tetsuya who wanted the group to embrace the world with their music and in this case promote love and peace.Despite the change of style, the music still stayed within the realms of the group's dance music roots.Despite using synth and being more electronic focused, this song utilized more strings, live house and very disco-like in feel.I was actually quite surprised to see this change in the music and worried if this was a permanent change or if it was temporary for this song only."
1,disappointed,"when i read the reviews for this product i was excited. However, the product did absolutely nothing for me. It was a complete wasted effort."
2,orange with scratchy bits,"This product is ok. It has a nice smell, but I don't see any difference in fine lines, dark spots, or skin softness. I think Neutrogena and Mary Kay sell a better product. Next time I will buy something else."
2,allergic reaction,"I loved this scrub the first time I used it. Nice fine crystals to polish the skin and left my face feeling super smooth. The second time I used it, I had some sort of allergic reaction and my face got hot/red/itchy. Needless to say I've discontinued use! You may have a better result though."
5,I LOVE this product!,"This is by far the best "" at home"" micro scrub, and costs a small percent of what I've paid at a spa!! Once a week seems to be perfect, and i find that using minimal water makes the scrub more effective."
5,Best Scrub Ever,"If you want to look younger, this is an awesome product. I don't look nearly my age and this has a lot to do with it. Been using it for many years and so happy that I found it online at a greatly reduced price."
3,Neutral,Not amazing but not bad either. Its not for you if you have moderate acne this stuff is good to clean off and scrub skin
5,"Feels awesome, smells great too",Works better than any other face scrub I have used. Has a sweet fresh lemony scent. Expensive but worth it.
2,Found Something Better,"Tried this product for 2 weeks; it did improve the clarity and softness, but I found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well, seemed to have a sticky feel. Since then, I found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called Microdermx by Nikkel Holistic Skincare. This product performs like magic; it is not too scratchy and I can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like I've been slapped with a wire brush. I can do the treatment 2-3x's a week, (like your supposed to) but I also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before. It is a magical product.Bette Hampton, Chicago, IL"
2,Not a favorite,I don't like the feeling of my skin after using this product - I still feel like I have to rinse something off. And my cheap Japanese exfoliating cloth is better and more effective!
2,"Alright, disappointed","I had initially used this product from the sample packs provided by my salon aesthetician. I had loved it then. Then I ordered the product from Amazon. And realised there is a big difference. The product in the sample packs was more granular which I wanted, while the one that I ordered was more creamy texture. I was very disappointed with the product."
5,Micro scrubbing bristly cleanser,"This is an awesome way to get the dead skin off your face. It's like rubbing fine, fine sand on your face. But after you wash it off your skin looks and feels great. I have been unable to find finer scrubbing like sand in other products. Highly recommend it. I bought this after trying a sample in the local health food store."
5,MUST TRY!,"I stumbled on this product online when looking for something else.I used to use a microdermabrasion product from LOREAL but they discontinued it and I'd not found any other product that was good. The price was reasonable so I decided to try it. The ingredients are all natural, and I was truly impressed with the results.I actually am able to use it every day with no irritation... after I cleanse my face, I apply the product. Immediately my face looks smooth and polished with a visible improvement in the fine lines that are around the eye area. I know this product my not work the same for everyone, but I'm happy with it. I even ordered one for my mom."
3,"Good handsoap, but pricey","This is a good hand soap and it comes in a pretty well designed bottle as well. Unlike other hand soap bottles, this one doesn't topple over because it has a wider base. I give it 3 stars because it's more expensive buying it at Amazon than local grocery store."
2,Not what I thought I was getting...,"Based on the picture I thought I was buying a Bemis product, but that is not what I received. I received a knockoff humidifier filter by a company called RPS Products BestAir. It may fit, haven't tried it yet, but I'm disgusted that they imply this is a Bemis product and it is not. Won't buy from them again."
1,It's a hoax,"According to the author of the book, he found that the individual accounts from family members were not matching up. He interviewed the family again, and they still did not match up. When he pointed this out to Ed Warren, Mr. Warren said for him to just make it up and make it scary. He also said that the family was crazy like all of the other people who come to them."
5,The most frightening story ever!,"One night I couldn't fall asleep, so I picked this book from my mom's book stash to read. It definately didn't help me sleep! It was so good I would stay up for hours every night reading it. The fact that it was a true haunting just fascinated me. Reading about the encounters the Snedekers had truley freaked me out. I literally slept with my bedroom light on every night I read this book. It has a way of making you scared in your own home, and not wanting to go in your own basement. I don't read much but this is a book I will read over and over. I recomend trying to find a copy. It is spooky and excellent!"
4,IN A DARK PLACE,"I just finished this book. I made the mistake of reading it before bed and then couldn't sleep!! One thing I found odd: The house was converted into 2 apts. An upstairs and a downstairs. The Snedeckers lived in the downstairs apt. There was a family living in the upstairs apt, but they never had any problems? I find this strange. I mean, it was the same house. They only mention them briefly in the book."
2,Not so scary.,"I recommand that you DON'T buy this book in excess of $200. I found this book not at all scary or believable. If you really are intent on reading this book, I suggest you borrow it from the library. I did and I am glad I didn't waste alot of money to read this."
4,In A Dark Place: The Story of a True Haunting,"Very scary but great book! Very well written and would suggest this book to anyone looking to for a story of ghosts and hauntings! Best scary story I have heard and/or seen! If you are spooked easily i would not recommend this book, unless reading it in the light!! Great, great scary story!"
2,Not the Warrens...AGAIN!,"Not only did I read the book, I recently saw the t.v. documentary on the discovery channel. I admit that in the beginning I thought that this story had the potential be quite frightening. And then, in stepped the Warren's and I pretty much tuned it out.The Warren's also participated in the Amityville Horror and The Haunted. While I do not know much about the outcome of the family in The Haunted, I do know, as the rest of the world does, that Amityville was a hoax and the Warren's love to scare people.I love ghosts and ghost stories but any story that the Warren's are involved in should be taken with a grain of salt (just my humble opinion). I'm thinking that had the family involved employed someone like Sylvia Browne, the outcome would have been COMPLETELY different and there would have been no talk of demonic forces.The book is worth reading if you enjoy getting the creeps like I do but as to it's validity, I have some serious doubts."
4,vividly scary...,A family lost due to innocence. Lives shattered due to silence.In a Dark Place is a compelling account of a haunting experience you would not want to happen to your family.
5,ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING!!!!!,"I cannot believe this book is out of print.It's still the scariest thing I've read on ANY subject and had me spooked of funeral homes,old drains,and rusty sinks for a long time. Not to mention the poor boy who's bedroom turned out to be the south coffin room.Different,chilling, and true, and the grotesque events leading to the hauntings made my skin crawl.Thank you, Mrs. Snedeker for telling the world your story. Thanks also to Ed and Lorraine Warren, and the state of Connenticut which I can't pass through anymore without thinking of this book...it's that good---"
5,One of the scariest books that I have ever read!,"Just when you think that Ed and Lorraine Warren have been through everything they come back with this book about a haunted former funeral home. This is one book that I will NOT read at night. I would say that this is even scarier than Beware the Night, The Haunted, and The Demonologist. If you have followed the work of the Warrens than this novel is definitely a must read. ""Do you know what they did to us!!"""
5,In A Dark Place! Truly Captivating,"This book was spooky, you can judge this book by it's cover! What drew me to the book was the cover, it was creepy and read ""The Story of a true haunting"" I could not put the book down and I never read it alone. Ed & Lorraine Warren are truly remarkable in thier work. I have the upmost respect for the unknown and will never dabble with anything dark. I guarantee when you read this true story, you will be looking in your closets and under your bed and definately over your shoulders. I am an owner of the hardcover edition!"
1,Wished it could have made more sense.,"Somewhat enjoyable read with phantasmic beasts that pine to commit sodomy on witless victims. Really, in all honesty, the one star rating mirrors the tremendously ill, high cost the sellers are asking for imbibing this made up horror. A curse and a byword on those greedy beast sellers!!!! Be not the next fool to pay such a high price. Hearken to the stingy voice within."
3,"Good, but necessary?","If you're a girl in your twenties or thirties this book definitely hits home. It's a quick read -- it took me only two sittings -- and the writing is tight, concise and good. However, it is another book about girls that shows our insecurities, issues with self-esteem/body issues and eating disorders (not to mention sexual dysfunction and deviance). Maybe this is good. Obviously many relate to the daily dramas of Pheobe Fine, the main character, however, I think plenty of these books exist already. I didn't find anything fresh or particularly interesting about Rosenfeld's stab at the genre."
3,from a young male writer,"In my compulsion to read something tragically endearing and self-deprecatingly funny, I devoured this over the weekend on the strength of The New Yorker excerpt. As you might expect, that excerpt contained the best chunk of her novel. However, it fell into line nicely as part of the evolution of one young woman's bout with insecurity and promiscuity, her trials with too much cellulite and not enough eating. The novel's post-feminist, woman-defined-by-man tone succeeds where Ally McBeal disappoints, but I found the initial chapters awkwardly paced while the finale seemed truncated, misplaced, almost, amongst the fourteen prior pieces that tended to read more like memoir than fiction. Rosenfeld's an obvious talent, a delicious stylist whom I'll watch with interest. But ultimately, like her character, I was left unfulfilled in that way you sometimes feel after a one-night stand even though the sex was great."
2,I would pass next time,The chapters in this book run long. I thought it would be funnier or sweeter. It does not keep me interested.
2,This and That,"I decided, after reading Lucinda Rosenfeld's hatchet job on Molly Jong-Fast's 'Normal Girl,' in the New York Times, to check out 'What She Saw.' Surprisingly, the books weren't all that different. Why is it everyone writes like they're from Southern California?"
3,"Nice, but...","...uninteresting. Lucinda Rosenfeld does an excellent job in ""What She Saw..."" inviting the reader into her fifth grade world and infusing him/her with emotions of angst, frustration and 10-year-old joy. But once we are inside, there isn't all that much going on. We have all been to fifth grade and had pretty much the same experiences. Fortunately, most of our memories are still good enough that the same day-to-day happenings of our youth are fresh enough when (and if) we want to recall them. We can engage with friends if we want to discuss fifth grade; we read Rosenfeld's account because we want something different or extraordinary.While Rosenfeld is very engaging, she ran into a classic essayist's problem: A lot of writing talent, not a lot to say."
2,what I saw - I didn't like,"I hated this book so those in search of objective viewpoints should look elsewhere. I'm a twentysomething woman who could not ""identify"" with the protagonist at all. I know plenty of women for whom having a romantic relationship is important, but none my age for whom it is the only source of self-esteem. I'm tired of this Reviving Ophelia assumption all young women are bundles of insecurity, afraid to take control of their lives, and hopelessly reliant on other people to define them.Some happen to be using their talents and achieving career success rather than waiting for the phone to ring. When will we see more books about them?"
2,Boring!!!!,This is probably the most boring book I have ever read . I could however relate with some amusement the secret thoughts of her adolesccent Psyche. I don't recommend.
3,What we see in Lucinda Rosenfeld ...,"Though extremely refreshing and witty during the first few vignettes, Rosenfeld's tiring dissertation in her repertoire of ex boyfriends and crushes become rather dreary and flat towards the end. I began to dislike the main character more and more as I witnessed her self-loathing and over self-analysis throughout the pages. At one point you just need her to start loving herself and get over it, so to speak. Perhaps its not about what she saw in Spitty Clark ""The Gentle Rapist"" or Humphrey Fung or Jack Geezo, but rather what she doesn't want to see in herself. Rosenfeld however does exhibit great moments in her prose when she is able to capture the awkwardness and timidnes of sexual intimacy, especially during the formidable teenage years. She also has a great hand at characterization. Nonetheless, a fair read (especially for post-break up times) even if one doesn't read all the way through."
3,But what did they see in Her?,"This book was very well written. I think Lucinda Rosenfeld is a talented author, and I will look for other books by her. That said, I found the book to be a ""much of a muchness."" In ten years, (age 16 - 26) Phoebe Fine never seemed to grow up, mature, reflect, or just grow, period. By the 10th or 12th man, I was a bit tired of her go nowhere, do nothing, victim mentality. I was also a bit tired of the men she chose--- never really seeing what she DID see in them. I'd give the writing style 5-stars, and the first half of the book 4-stars, but it was too much of the same thing to be more than a 3-star book overall.Certainly worth reading though."
4,Nice,"Cute, seems a little bit fragil , compared to the Sango I had, but for everyday use it's fine.Shipping was fast."
4,Convenience is fabulous!,"I bought this carrier in my never-ending quest for the PERFECT baby carrier. In terms of comfort, it's OK. However, it is extremely convenient while running short errands, as it keeps my hands free. The raincoat attachment that is located inside one of the pockets was a nuisance, so I cut it out in order to free up some space. I can now carry 2 diapers, some wipes, and a small changing pad in that pocket. I can also carry my wallet and cell phone in the outer pocket. It's very handy and my daughter loves being close to me. I recommend it to people all the time!"

4,Recent Experience,"I had an interesting experience recently. Suggesting that we tour Hearst Castle as we drove from Santa Barbara north to Silicon Valley, we took that long leisurely ride up the hill to the Castle. Having read The Angel's Cup about two years earlier, I was struck by the memories evoked of the charming characters from the story. I found myself visualizing Maggie and the spirit at the pool and images of characters on the terraces and in the parlors. To my delight I found myself engaged in my own fantasy at the Castle. Although fiction, The Angel's Cup had in some obscure way carried forward to enrich my personal experience. Worth the read."
4,It was fun....,It was fun to watch them carry on the series. It is a little jarring from the original but all in all its not bad.
3,I enjoyed this little movie.,"I thought this movie was pretty good and I got some good laughs out of it. As some have noted, the production values are not real high but that did not bother me as it was quite inventive for being such a low budget affair. Some of the criticism seems pretty harsh but I guess they just didn't get into it like I did or something."
3,I found this movie offensive in every way...,... I could imagine. It seemed that the film makers decided to try and make people as mad and confused as possible... and they succeeded with me. I started out laughing but that soon turned to anger as the movie progressed. If this was their goal then they reached it. I have no clue what the other reviewers are prattling on about... did they see this? I'm giving this movie 3 stars because I liked the Bush bashing and a few other scenes and hated the whole section with the little people at the end. If this was only an hour instead of 80 minutes it would be a classic... (if they let me choose the scenes to cut out).
1,"If I could give this film 0 stars, I would.","Lame. What a horrible waste of time. I kept waiting for it to get interesting. With a film of this type, it could be really funny and clever, but it falls flat. Too much nothing. Too much stupid. Really. I love ""Kids in the Hall"" humor, I totally love South Park, and Monty Python is engrained in the lifestyle where I live. This film, however, is painful. It could have been good, but it totally missed the mark. Ouch."
4,I like to cook,I enjoy the features on the food processor. It is easy to clean and has enough power to do what I want in an instant.
2,Before you buy...,"Before you buy a Kitchen Aid food processor, price the bowl replacement part online and reconsider. The handle is made of multiple plastic moving parts used to secure the top and provide safety interlock. Handle top broke after only 3 years during routine cabbage shredding. (Last food processor lasted 20+.) Best price for replacement bowl online I could find $59.95.Other problem I noted is location and design of the chute through which food is fed. Tends to allow food to clog between chute and edge of lid. Hard to clean. Again prior food processors at lesser price had no such problems."
5,Love it!!,"It lives up to the Kitchen Aid name. It chops, it slices and purees.. you name it. I've made everything in there from dough to sauces and it has been amazing."
4,dough blade,All I wanted was a dough blade to make pie dough and couldn't find an attachment to buy for the 7 cuper
3,Very dissapointed.,"Well, I opted for a kitchenaid food processor over black and decker or some other cheap brand, and I wish I hadnt. Althought I was very happy with it the first night I brought it home and tested it, I quickly realized that I would need different disc/blades for different tasks. I thought no problem.. I will buy extra accessories. WRONG. THEY DONT EXIST for the 7 cup model! Just because I have a small family and don't have large quanities to process does not mean I enjoy everything sliced paper thin. I am packing it up and returning it tonight. Will go with cuisinart, my first instinct."
4,Still Works Like New,"We got ours just about 5 years ago and it still works like the day we bought it. No issues with the motor or the blades and there's no mold to be seen. We use it about once a week or more. When we bought it, it was the perfect size, but now we often find ourselves needing a bit more space (not a negative of this of course, just a caution), especially now that we are baking more. It would be good for one person or a couple."
3,"Nice,but not exactly what im looking for.","After months of review and many websites search on processors i decided on this one that i bought from Costco for 89.00.It seems to be well built and its very quiet to my suprise however,i dont like the fact that it comes with only one setting ,and it goes a bit slow,i do a lot of high volum processing and speed is very important for me,its a nice processor but i need one with a low/high setting and a bit faster."
1,Work Bowl Handle Fatal Flaw,"The handle of the work bowl is poorly designed and cheaply manufactured. Water gets trapped inside making it almost impossible to keep clean. Beyond that, the plastic construction cracks a falls apart. With the handle broken, you can't engage the safety release and the whole unit is worthless. Our handle cracked early on, but waited 18 months to completely fall apart. Too bad for us because the warranty is only 12 months and beyond that Kitchen Aid's only suggestion is to purchase another faulty part at $40 a pop."
4,It does a good job,This food processor is well made with good materials. The motor runs smoothly and quietly. Food is pulverized quickly and uniformly. This food processor replaced a side-motor Hamilton Beach. That processor was very cheaply made and smelled like burning plastic every time I turned it on. The Kitchenaid far outperforms it. My only complaint with this model is that the lid and blade are a bit hard to clean because of various nooks and crannies.
1,don't waste your money!!,"i bought this cd rom mainly for the lung sounds. i am very disappointed in this software! it contains terrible recordings of lung sounds and poor explainations. it does not even contain the correct auscultation sites, only rudimentary pictures. i was hoping for good examples of wheezing, stridor, crackles and rhonchi, but the only good recording was of the normal lung sounds. if all i needed was a good example of normal lungs, i would listen to my cat."
4,To the Core,"I do thing over the top. Instead of buying one book on a topic, i buy two. This was the second and i only opened it twice. If you are just getting started and want to really change everything about your workout, go with this title or Core Performance."
2,"Poorly Organized, not very helpful","I had high hopes for this book. The book has good pictures, which illustrate the exercises well. However, it is very unorganized, with chapters that don't go in any particular order. Additionally, the routines that are recommended are very poorly worded, and don't give specifics about time to hold a position, or how many reps/sets to do. All in all, I was very disappointed with this book. To add insult to injury, the binding fell apart, and the pages are now everywhere."
2,not so great,I found that this book was very hard to follow. The exercises are good to incorporate into other workouts but this book overall is not worth the money.
2,Not worth it for the Price,"I was really excited when I bought this book, eager to improve my core workouts. This book was a big let down. The book itself is poorly organized. The first 75 pages are complete filler, so characteristic of poorly written workout literature. To clarify, this book is lined with encyclopedic coverage of many aspects of training such as diet, weight training... basically a topical review of stuff anyone but the complete novice would already know. The workouts outlined in the book are simply listed without pictures... what gives! Furthermore in the pictured section on core exercises, the authors simply cluster core exercises together into broad sections without explaining which muscles the exercises are targeting. Finally, the models in this book are all old and ugly. I wish I could return this book. The authors should have had me edit their work before publication."
4,"Super Friends: Season One, Vol. One","This is the old Super Friends show from the early 70's which I grew up with. I bought it as a birthday present for my 5yr old son. Compared to today's animation & storylines, one can tell it's over 30 yrs old but he likes it. I think, a child over the age of 9 would think it's somewhat hokey, though. Good memories here for us 40+."
5,Perfect for my boys,"I love this show for my boys. All of today's cartoons emphasize violence where these emphasis solving problems with your mind. Also, I love the vocabulary that they are being exposed too and the plot lines in these stories. My 3 year old only sticks around for parts of it and he loves seeing his super friends. My 5 year old is glued to the tv through the whole story. He mostly watches them by himself but when I do get to sit down with him to watch, we really have great discussions about what has happened in the story."
5,1973...can't go wrong,"This is a great set. Vol one of the first season. Dc at its cartoon best. Superman, batman and the flash"
3,A Long Time Ago....,I bought this remembering how much I loved the show as a kid but apparently it has been too long since I was that 9 year old boy getting up early on Saturdays too watch. It did not seem this lame 37 years ago and frankly it is very hard to sit thru even one complete episode today. Was this show this awful then? It must have been terrible for the adults working to put this together very week.
5,great for lunch,This is a great product for quick lunch on the go. My daughter takes it to school. The only comment I have is that we don't use the crackers (she wants her tuna on bread).
2,Very basic - good for the newbie,"Don't let the title of the book convince you! Basically, it does a good job of telling you how Dreamweaver MX works and where everything is located. As for ""doing everything"", well that's a different story! If you're an intermediate or advanced user this book is not for you. If you're just getting started with Dreamweaver, this book is pretty good at showing you what/where everything is."
5,NOT FOR COMPUTER GEEKS WITH NO LIFE,This Meadhra book is written in a clear style that is easy to follow and is especially usefull for those of us who have a life and aren't interested in an encyclopedia that covers every nuance of machine code.
3,"""The Virginian Season Six""","I bought the first two seasons of ""The Virginian"" and was completely satisfied with the shows. Season six has been somewhat disappointing. Despite the coming of John Mc Intire as the new owner of Shiloh, the childish scripts of several shows and the lack of the presence of the main characters on several episodes, The Virginian and Trampas, made those somewhat boring and uninteresting. Obviously, by season six the series had passed its best years. Still, several episodes are still top-notch and that made the investment on season 6 worthwhile."
2,"Outdated now, good if you're two years behind on JDK, though.","Looks like a good tutorial book - however, it's now several generations out of date, which is a problem. Sun keeps updated copies of the books on line, but the limits of printing mean that the bound volumes don't get updated. This covers Java JDK 1.2 - NOT JAVA JDK 5 (the current release). Since there are significant changes between the revisions, this is of limited utility these days."
3,I used it 3 times and then....,"This initially seemed to be a great product - ground-in dirt on kitchen tiles lifts but you need lots of old towels to ""mop"" up the water. The capacity of the tank is a bit small for a kitchen and hallway! The cord is a bit short but then, you don't trip over it. Sadly, it lasted 3 gentle uses."
3,Should have checked this oneout before,"Although I really like the cleaning ability of the steam blaster, I wasn't sent the attachment needed for all the scrubbing attachments. After reading some of the other reviews I see I am not alone in the fruitless search of trying to find them.Nest time I will not buy a Euro-Pro product., and I'll make sure that there are accessories available to purchase seperately"
1,Seriously Dissapointed,"I purchased a new unit after reading other reviews. While I realize it is not a professional unit, I thought it would do the job for me. I found it easy to use and it seemed to work ok.... while it lasted. I had the unit for just about a week and was using it to clean tile grout in my bathroom. I used the unit just 3 times and it it just quit! Everything I tried would not bring it back. The heater light would not come back on. It seemed to be either the switch itself did not hold up or possibly an internal fuse somewhere. Also, the small plastic scrub brush melted down to stubble only after a couple hours of use. Very dissapointed!"
2,no replacement parts or customer support,"I purchased this item today at Lowe's. Works great, love it - HOWEVER, you can not find replacement parts if something brakes NO PLACE to get extra 'pocket towels' and you definately need more than one towel. DO NOT PURCHASE - I returned the item today - one towel cleans 1-2 rooms. Yes, you can wash it and reuse it, but you need extra towels to finish the job!!! If something breaks you WILL NOT get replacement parts. I went to the Shark website - model #S3325 - NO PRODUCT FOUND!If anyone knows where to get replacement pocket towels PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!"
2,Poor quality - broken more than functioning,"This is a great product when it works. Please, please keep your receipt and warranty information. You will need it . Unfortunately, I did not. The products and its attachments are made of palstic and they tend to melt at high stress areas. I used mine only 4 times for the floors and then the adaptor melted. Working with their customer service is impossible. I am still trying to get my order of three month ago straightened out. The adaptor was on back order for almost two months. So I have been using the trusty mop ever since. I have another shark product (cordless sweeper) and though it has lasted longer, it wont last much longer. I have had it about a year with frequent use. Good luck!"
3,Not working as well as when I first bought...,"I'm re-writing my review. Initially I gave this 5 stars but after only a few months, I'm downgrading to 3 stars. There are two lights on the cleaner: ""Heating"" and ""Steam Ready"". It takes about 10 minutes from the time I turn the cleaner on for the light to go from ""Heating"" to ""Steam Ready"". I use this primarily for my floors. The first few times I cleaned them, the light stayed on ""Steam Ready"" for the entire time I cleaned the floor and there was obviously a lot of steam (the floor would continue to steam for about 15 seconds after I'd cleaned it. However, now the ""Steam Ready"" light changes back to ""Heating"" in less than a minute and it is obvious that there is not that much steam coming out. I'm spending more and more time waiting for ""Steam Ready"". I should have stuck with my Bissel Steam Mop!"
1,I wish I could give this 0 stars..,"I will never purchase another Shark product. This is my second steamer. I purchased the steamer at my local Lowes Home Improvement, used it for 2 months and it completely stopped working. Lowes was nice enough to do an exchange (luckily, I kept the box and receipt), I returned home with another one and after 6 months, it too does not work anymore. I love the idea and the clean you get with steam cleaning but this model and make certainly does not live up to it's standards. I will purchase another steamer, but not from this company."
2,Broke after 1 month,"When it was working, i thought it was great for cleaning my floors, however, it stopped producing steam after 1 month. I can't use it now. Cheap product. Instead of providing all those dam accessories, they should have spent more time testing the product for defects."
1,Not Worth the Trouble.,"We bought the Shark Blaster from Target less than a year ago and we have just received out third unit under warranty. The first unit lasted about four months, never seemed to produce enough steam and then just quit. We tried to get a refund from Target but the three month return policy had expired. We then contacted Euro Pro to have it repaired and had to pay shipping both ways. The second unit, which was delivered new, failed (no steam again) after three months of normal household use. We called Euro Pro again and requested a refund but, since we didn't purchase directly from them, they ""couldn't"" give us our money back. They would, however, cut us a break and give us free return shipping. How nice. Well, we now have our third new unit and when it fails we will order the more expensive Vapor Clean. By the way, the shipping to ""repair"" the Shark cost us about $70. Buyer beware!RGN, Maryland."
2,Better options out there for steam cleaning your home!,"Bought this for my parents as a holiday gift about a year ago. Unfortunately the unit never lastedthat long.Unit takes a long time to become steam ready,It also has to reheat up during use which lessens the steam output afterabout 2 minutes the entire time you use it.It worked ok, but for the price you can find something better.It tends also to leak from the hose so becareful.In the end the unit stopped working and even after the manufacturer suggestedcleaning with vinegar it never produced steam again.Canisters are not worth the hassle of the added bulk..We will be looking into a morecompact user friendly upright unit ."
1,Major Flaw,"This is a great cleaning tool. Unfortunately it won't last very long. The male stem at the end of the extensions is made of plastic and will easily break on any of the end tools that don't have the protective sleeve. Replacements are expensive and you will have to buy them on a monthly basis if you use this tool moderately. Until the manufacturer corrects this design flaw, I would look for another product."
1,This is a Bust,I bought this product after reading the reviews and hoping for a miracle. The pieces did not fit together well and I found it difficult to assemble the attachments. The product was not well made either.I sent it back to the company for a refund. Save your self the postage and your time - don't buy it.
4,wondering?,"I would like to know how to get my Shark steam cleaner working again. I loved it, but it quit and I have not been able to get satisfaction on getting it repaired. It was working great........I filled it with water and it would not turn on again. Help!! If anyone else had this problem and can figure out a way to fix it without trying to work with Shark..........please let me know."
2,Shark S3325,"Shark Ultra Steam Blaster - S3325This product is not all that it is touted to be.It is good for cleaning small areas that aren't too dirty.The caked on stuff still has to be brushed with a heavy dutycleaner, then steamed away. Would I purchase it again?Yes, but I wouldn't pay more than 1/2 of the asking price."
1,SHARK STEAM CLEANER,"I WAS GIVEN THE SHARK STEAMER IN DEC OF 07. IT WAS A GREAT MACHINE FOR 6 MONTHS. ALL OF A SUDDEN IT STOPPED STEAMING. I NOW HAVE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER, I RECEIVED AS A GIFT AND DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED. I ALSO FOUND IT VERY CLUMSY TO MOVE AROUND.MELODY OCT 2008"
1,Shark Ultra Steam Blaster- Cleaned Me Out of $100 Thats All,"This unit is a complete disappointment. Hang on to your money! It really does not do ANY of it's claimed tasks well. Aside from cleaning us out of $100, it simply did not work."
3,"Yes, it does provide live steam","This device does provide useable amounts of live steam, i.e. the invisible stuff, not the tiny water droplets we think of as ""steam"" I'd say it puts out live steam six or seven inches from the handle without any attachments next to it. However, with the mop attachment, I seriously doubt it provides true steam to the floor.Its particularly good on chrome and windows. Paradoxically, its good for deep cleaning, i.e. meticulous cleaning, and for touch ups. Not much in between. By no means would this be your only mop. It can't produce really big amounts of steam you would need to do heavy duty work fast.It does give you the ability to do a lot of cleaning without soap. Its pretty impressive to make your bathroom sparkling, without any soap odor of any kind whatsoever. I give it three stars, but I'm being fairly conservative."
1,No replacement parts,The steamer does not come with the carpet glider as in earlier modelsI bought this one believing it would be the same as the one my mom bought with the carpet glider brush and wire brush cleaner but it does'nt come with those attachments and you can't order them.The machine's potential is now limited to spot cleaning only and hard surfaces.You can't do a general carpet cleaning unless you use the 2 inch brush that would take a week to do one room
1,NOT AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS,I thought I was buying something that would be able to clean my floors great as well as other areas. I am completely disappointed in this machine. I would not recc. it to anyone as it just does not clean as great as it says . Its for very light cleaning at best
1,Bought several and they do not last,I have bought several of this unit. I like what it does when it works. It cleans my huge kitchen floor. BUT one day it will just die in the middle of a job. I erroneously thought it was just a couple of bad units. I think we have bought 3. They only last a couple of months. The last one has lasted for several years because it started out as my mother's unit. We have used it for about a year until it died this weekend. I won't buy another one from Shark. I will buy another steamer mopper but not SHARK. We have also had the battery charged floor sweeper and it has broken within a month. Maybe it is the company like others say.
4,Over all a handy cleaner,I have had mine for a few years. It does clean about everything. The only complaints I have is it takes a while to heat up and doesn't stay hot long enough and I had to fix the on off switch. It is great for cleaning dried on food. It even cleaned the very nasty dog kennel fairly easily.If you have small children this is great to clean all the toys theat get dirt in the groves.Don't let your kids use it because they can get burned. Mine didn't believe it was hot.
3,This album showcases rap start voices are raw but good,I like the song Heavenbound makes you wanna dance. Praise Him is a terrific song because it's so true that's what we gotta do.
5,"I love it,it has made me thinkshow me not to be scared",I have to say that even from the first time I heard DCTalk I fell in love with the way they present the message.
2,Ok but.................,I am a big fan of Dc Talk. I love their music but this one wasnt that great good try but they have done better. DC TALK RULZ
2,They definitely improved.,"Over the years, DC Talk has improved and matured. All the songs on this CD have great lyrics, but Toby needs to let somebody else sing every once in awhile. His voice is annoying after eight songs. My favorite tracks are &#65533;Time ta Jam,&#65533; &#65533;Spinnin&#65533; Round,&#65533; and &#65533;Allelujah.&#65533; The lyrics of &#65533;Time ta Jam&#65533; are very creative. &#65533;Spinnin&#65533; Round&#65533; and &#65533;Allelujah&#65533; have good vocals by Kevin. If you are a DC Talk freak, I would recommend this CD just to have the entire collection, although this is not their best CD."
4,First effort is great.,"This is when DCT was all about rap. This was made when they got out of college, and you can hear the youngness in their voices. This is great album. They announce their faith wonderful. My favorite song is the first track Heavenbound. It is awesome, and it was the beginning of something wonderful... Not only the album but the band."
1,pitiful...,"Anyone out there a recording musician? Remember that first low budget demo you ever recorded? Remember how proud you were at first because you'd finally recorded something, but then when you play it for a friend you wind up explaining how much better it would be if you had better equipment, or how ""this is just a rough demo"", etc, etc... That's kinda how I think the Toby, Mike and Kevin all feel about this album. No shame in it (although I can't believe a record company could see DC Talk's talent somewhere in this putrid mess)...it takes guts to take that first step and make that first awful recording, and these guys are proof that working hard and developing your talent will eventually pay off. Only buy this album if you are really really curious about how these guys sounded as raw (and I mean RAW), inexperienced young musicians, and only if you can appreciate the guts in bearing your soul on tape for the first time."
1,Not so good.,"To me this DC Talk album was not as good as the others. To say the least, in my opinion christian rock and all that stuff is not for this world. grow up people listen to real music not the same stuff we all hear about god. if i wanted to listen to this, i'd throw up."
4,love their music but........,"I've been looking for the song title, left behind by DC Talk but can't seem to find the album it originates from any help???"
2,"If you're a fan of the band, skip it","I bought this CD for a few bucks a while ago at a Christian music store. The next day I brought it back. I expected it to be different, but I didn't expect it to be horrible.This is early '90s rap. We're talking really bad here. Like, Vanilla Ice/Ninja Rap-bad. They had to start somewhere, but if you want my advice, skip this and go to the good stuff - Supernatural, Jesus Freak, etc."
1,not worth the effort,"This Cd was listed as being an 8-disc set. Unfortunately, it is only one disc, and the one without the songs I purchased it for."
4,A great dance mix,Another great compilation of dance hits to help you through the day. This cd is easy to get addicted to. This is a tribute to the best of the 90's dance movement. A must have for any dance collection.
3,Only for collectors,"While I don't think this is the greatest film done on the life of Diana, The Princess of Wales; I still enjoyed it.There really isn't anything new in this one except what they added about her romance with Dodi Fayed. If you just like to collect things on the Princess then this is one you want to add to your collection. I think the actress who played Diana did an above average job."
1,ahhh,awful actors. the actress didn't even come close to portraying diana. she cries in like every scene lol. if u like cheesy tv movies then here ya go
4,Great Supplement For A Beginner,"After purchasing my iBook in July, I wanted a book that would possibly give me some hints for longer battery life, greater mobility, ect. This book came through on most of these points. It is very much geared towards beginners, although I am quite familiar with the Mac platform, I did find a few items in this book very useful, and pertinent. It also contained a couple of things I never knew. Mr. Steinberg's book is well-written, in easy-to-understand ""One Hour Lessons"". I would recommend this book to ANYONE new to computers, and even to seasoned Mac user's who want to have a handy reference availible for when problems arise."
2,Didn't fit,"Although I currently have a Delta faucet and stopper, this replacement didn't fit. Has an extra ""hole"" that would not fit past the catch in drain. My fault maybe for not measuring, but description made it seem pretty standard. Regardless, product was rather cheaply made."
5,These essays have had a profound impact on my own work.,"I am not shocked that this wonderful work is out of print -- it's simply history repeating itself. But I do think we should work very hard to get it back into print, probably by one of the small feminist publishers, such as The Feminist Press or Aunt Lute or Spinster -- because they are faithful to their books. However, until that happens, those looking for the essays will find many of them reprinted in various anthologies, including the title essay, ""Silences: When Writers Don't Write"" in IMAGES OF WOMEN IN FICTION: FEMINIST PERSPECTIVES ed. Susan Koppelman, Popular Press, 1972, and still in print and available from the publisher."
1,No summary as I've not had the luxury of reading it.,It's impossible to review or rate this book as it's not available. Many of my devotional readings reference this book...but sadly I've not read it due to unavailibility. What can I do to help get this back in print?
5,Love It,I finally found a product that makes dusting a whole lot easier. Feather dusters just spread dust around and made me sneeze. Rags and polish were a pain. This item is great.
1,Cheap and ineffective,"Save your money or find some other product. What a waste of money this is, the handle and frame are made of very lightweight plastic. When shaking off the duster, the handle separated from the paper refill. Strongly suggest you find another product to meet your dusting needs."
3,An updated review.,"Now is 2005, so this book is four years old. I wanted to write an updated review here to let anyone who is considering a copy of this volume that I think it would be worth it to pick up a used copy for five bucks or so. Obviously, it doesn't include anything that's been published in the last four years, so in that sense, it's utility can be limiting, but most of the books that are reviewed are still in print. One of the book's features that I appreciated the most was that it includes a bibliography of wordless books, and unlike other such lists I have found, most of the books are actually in print and I don't have to try to order a copy from some small press overseas.Another thing I've used this book for is for suggestions for birthday presents for my nieces. Since they're not the same age as my kids, I'm not as familar with what they might be ready to read."
3,"updated, sure, but revised?","This book may have been updated, but I don't know about the ""revised"" part. I was disappointed to find that this edition contained the same and similar inaccuracies as the prior editions. For example, _Weetzie Bat_ is a wonderful book. But its sequels are, in order, _Witch Baby_, _Cherokee Bat and the Goat *Guys*_ (not Boys!), _Missing Angel Juan_, and _Baby Be-bop_. I expect better things from the New York Times children's book editor--not sloppy errors.I'm glad this book exists, and it does contain much valuable information, and it is well-organized. But perfect it is not."
1,Too many authors/books omitted,"I agree with another reviewer that too many authors/titles are omitted, like the gruffalo books, thomas the tank books, etc. Very disappointing. I would have returned it if I did not have it shipped internationally."
3,Belly ring.,"Really pretty, small. One stone was already falling out when I got it. I might wear it anyways."
2,I find it very drying,"I find this product to be so very drying, can't figure that out. It smells nice - I'm familiar with the healing properties of Aloe and yet this is not a god item for me. Since beginning useage I have had drier, tighter hands = yes I wash my hands a lot, but this is ridiculous. I prefer the clear rain."
4,Awesome show,"I got the 26 disc set and I was a little disappointed that they came in a disc thing rather than boxes but that wasn't a big deal because thay all played fine and everything. The only other problem I had was that season 1 has no bonus material, the words come up on every disc but you can't select it. Other than that this is a must have for House fans.P.S. did anyone else have this problem?"
4,Gotta love House,My whole family loves to sit and watch House. Can't wait for Season 5 to be released on DVD.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"It was a boxed set of the first 4 seasons all in 1 box, the dvd's were not in cases but in plastic sleeves, I've only watched the first 2 disks and they freeze up and skip sceens, so I'm hoping they all don't do that and it wasn't a waste of over $100. I was expecting the individual boxes for each season as seen in stores and on the site. Even the e-mail they sent me to review my purchase had the picture of each season in the seperate boxes. I'm a bit disappointed and can only hope all the other disks will play without freezing and skipping. If I had it to do over I would just buy them in a store, so I could simply exchange it for a dvd that works. Not So Happy House Fan."
2,ok,Not what i expected. I thought that the dvds were going to be in cases and not cd protectors. good show but dont waste your money.
4,House: Seasons 1-4 Collection,"Just began watching series during the holidays. Had to order the first 4 seasons. Have watched them all already. Great show. Sorry I had missed before, but so glad I could order the series."
4,Thank you,"It was shipped in a timely fashion, and everything was intact. Thank you for a good product."
5,House is Great!!,This item was great and extremely fast shipping.. I paid cheap item for being used with four seasons!!!! I received this item exactly like the picture and it works great and the disc are clean!!! thank you
1,House Seasons 1 - 4,"I still do not have this item, even though it was to be delivered by August 3rd."
1,House is made for Losers.,"If you want to watch a Tv show about a doctor who insults everyone and breaks all the codes of medical ethics, then this show is for you. Regretfully the way Doctors work today, this show is not fiction,. It sadly reflects reality, and reality stinks."
4,House: Season 1-4 Collection,"I like the fact that I could buy all 4 seasons in 1 package rather than each one separately. The very first episode we watched on it skipped a couple of times. Nothing really bad, but an annoyance especially since we spent $149.00 on it. I like the extras that are added on the end of the discs."
3,"Good overall, but...","The product arrived much earlier than stated online, so that was a very big plus. I got these DVDs as a Christmas present for my boyfriend, and he called me one day to tell me that one of the disks main menu was in chinese, and the episodes were recorded directly for the television. I went over to his apartment to see for sure, and he was absolutely right! All of the other disks work fine, there is just one that there is a problem with. The episodes on the disk say ""Fox 5"" or something in the lower right hand corner, and has the television rating in the upper left corner. The picture is a little distorted, but nothing we can't live with. I was just a little disappointed to be paying so much for something and have it not be what I expected."
4,Great Watch for the Price,"Initially ordered the the watch with blue face, but exchanged it because the face was very bright blue, not dark blue as depicted in website. This is a great watch for the money. I have a small wrist so the strap fits well, but those with larger wrists may have a problem. The only real drawback is that the date window is tiny and the numerals are difficult to read."
4,Very nice for the price,"I just got this watch today and really like it. Fairly light weight compared to my Pro Diver (which is a nice change). I wanted a watch similiar to Obama's but did not want to spend over $300 for the one he rec'd as a gift from the Secret Service. This is almost as nice plus it is an eco drive. The chronograph dials are hard to read, esp the minutes but thats ok. The strap is just OK. I have smaller wrists so size was not a problem. Can not give it 5 stars due to the strap and hard to read sub dials (date hard to read too) but these are minor issues. Also the glow in the dark luminecense is not very good. Lasts less than an hour. I put a black leather band on this and it dresses up the watch. The dial is not a deep solid black but more of a very very dark gray/greenish color but looks black for the most part. Overall a solid 4 star rating."
5,Great watch for the price,"I purchases this watch around a month back and after continuously using it for 1 month I am very satisfied. I was a bit distracted with some bad ratings for this but eventually bought it. I have replaced the fiber strap with a brown thick leather strap and this becomes a kool formal watch. It has been keeping time accurate till date.I purchased it mainly becoz of eco-drive...the hands glow well in dark and chronograph gives it kool look.Overall a nice , beautiful watch in good price.HK"
4,"Watch review, AT0200 eco-drive","AS ADVERTISED. It seemed as though many of the reviews complained about the strap, but I find it quite comfortable and easily buckled, just a few days of 'flexing'.Keeps very accurate time.While I realize the 24 hour feature, for those of us that wish to use 24 hour time, adding and/or substracting 12 should be no problem. I think substituting this feature for a 12 (or 24)hour 'stop watch' dial would be so much better, and can't see where this would adversely effect the cost of the unit.If you offer this watch with this feature, PLEASE ADVISE, and I may get one."
2,Could not keep the date!,"Could not keep the date!Purchased this watch, timely shipping, however watch cannot keep the calendar date. Will be returning hopefully for an exchange."
3,Watch is Great...band not so much,The Eco-Drive chronograph canvas is everything I expected...nice timepiece with simplistic yet stylish good looks. As with other reviews...unless you have an exceptionally small wrist have another band ready. I had pre-purchased a zulu military green band that fits the bill perfectly.
3,Affordable watch but what is with the wrist band?,"Wristband is so darn short and I don't even have a thick wrist. One day I'll change it to leather band which will improve the look significantly. Eco drive is obviously terrific; no need to worry about battery change. I previously got Invicta watch which is automatic and required no battery, but that sucker won't last for more than day and a half if you put it away in a drawer. I gave that to my relative and bought this one, which is light and good looking. Interestingly, I found another one that I like alot but not sure I'd spend 300 dollars just to keep tap of time."
3,"Mediocre Watch, like others said, band way too small!","After reading other reviews about the small band, I thought that I should not have a problem because I have a fairly small wrist. I couldn't even get it in the first hole adjustment. No big deal, I just went to Wal-Mart and purchased one that was almost identical for $12. Besides that my only other negative review of this watch would be that the larger second hand (the red one) only moves when your using it as a timer and it stops after 60 minutes. I like the overall look when it's on my wrist and also the fact that you never have to replace the battery. In general I would say it's a mediocre watch, but I kept it because I know the good reputation of Citizen watches."
5,Great Deal!,"This watch is a steal at this price. The strap isn't great, although I have received complements on the color. You can always replace the strap with something a little higher end. I would pay $129 for the watch by itself without a strap."
5,"Great Watch, Great Price","This is my 5th Citizen watch and the 2nd Eco Drive I have owned. I like the eco drive system and the previous watch has been keeping accurate time now for over 7 years, during 3 military deployments and through some pretty ruff stuff. The band has worn out (replaced), the face is scratched (might be able to be polished out), but it is still working and I have never replaced the battery. I don't go out of the way to keep in sunlight to recharge it just keeps working. Believe me this has seen some abuse; on and off armored vehicles, several IED explosions, 2 motorcycle accidents, 3 girlfriends, wrenching on bikes, cars and tanks, even a dog attack/bite, still works and looks good.I like the simple easy to read black face and the luminescent markings. The band is rugged and easily replaced. Put a new leather band from Hadley-Roma and for under $15.00 you have a new watch that looks like it's worth $300.Great watch, great price!"
3,I dont't know,"I don' t know...I like the watch style, but there are a few things I don't like.First I charge the watch all day but the light that supposedly has during the night does not work well, only a few minutes.... (clockwise)Second: one of the bands is shorter, so the watch is not in the center of the wrist I HATE THAT!!And third: Whyyyyyyy the chronograph is not the little one"
4,Like it so far,"I have had this for just one week. I like it. It is easy to read and everything works. It is a clean design for a chronograph. I did change the watch band to a brown leather so I could wear this at work. The band that it comes with would be fine for very causual use but for work it looks too much like I plan to go backpacking. The manual has a few confusing parts. For example, it says if the stem is a screw down type then it should be screwed down. Does this watch come with two types of stems? I spent some time trying to figure out whether mine is a scew type (that just doesn't work) or a non screw type. I still don't know. I guess I'll find out if water gets in and it stops working. These are relatively minor complaints but that I why I gave four rather than five stars. As usual, Amazon was great in delivery and price."
2,Decent watch if you have a slim wrist,"I probably should have paid more attention to the other reviews of this watch, but it looked so nice in the pictures and was rated highly by other reviewers that I bought it, despite some reviewers saying the band was short. Well the band is VERY SHORT. It is not like I have a super thick wrist but the strap was on its last hole for me. Plus, the holes have metal grommets so the holes are farther apart than on most watch bands, limiting fit choices. Sure, I could have swithed bands, but I liked the cloth--that is why I bought the watch. Also, I saw a Citizen replacement cloth strap and it is $70!!! I was not going to throw away such an expensive strap. Finally, the watch face is totally flat--no depth at all--so it looks cheaper in person than in the pictures. For a couple of reasons, therefore, I can't recommend this watch. If you do like it, be sure you have a small wrist."
1,Good alternative to JCrew Timex... but failed,"When I purchased the watch, I had every intention of changing the strap to an orange ballistic nylon one; the initial strap was just way too heinous. After I switched the strap, I felt the watch looked really good, and was a good alternative to the timex they sold at jcrew, which cost significantly more. I was able to wear the watch for 2 weeks, and I really enjoyed it. However, the only problem with the watch is that the crystal is really cheap. One day at dinner, a friend accidentally banged a mug lightly against the crystal. The crystal shattered, and I brought it into various shops to try to get it repaired. All shops quoted me repair costs of $300+, and Citizen said it was not covered by warranty. Thus, 2 weeks with the watch, it broke, and became unusable.DO NOT BUY"
2,Not a real chronograph,"Minuses:It measures only seconds,and minutes; not tenths of seconds.The design is very simple, the dial is not sophisticated, just a classic, military design.The red indicator is too thin to be easily seen. The strap does not fit a 8"" wrist. A Citizen, but an ""almost"" cheap looking and, maybe, a little overpriced watch.Pluses:Eco-drive, and WR 100m.The watch's size is medium.Not heavy."
2,Citizen eco-drive watch,"Received this watch for Christmas, have yet to wear it. The stitching on the band is unraveling. The watch face itself is not easy to read, the stopwatch dial is too small and makes it very challenging to see."
4,Great watch for the price,"I normally wear a Seamaster, but wanted a cheaper watch to wear when traveling, being outdoors, etc. I find I wear it much more often than that and it has earned a place in my rotation. It's simple, accurate, sharp looking, and the small band doesn't create a problem since I have normal sized arms. I suppose those that can't fit can easily swap out the band, but I like the canvas / metal eyelet styling of it."
3,Nice watch for small arm,"The watch face is great. nice and easy to read. with a great feature of never having to buy batteries. However the band will only fit an arm that is 8"" diameter or less. and at 8 "" it is a little tight. It says size mens, but only the VERY SMALL wrist man."
3,This watch is thick!,"First off, the AT0200-05E has a beautiful face. There's a reason why I purchased it. But remember to look at the measurements for the thickness of the watch before you make your purchase. It is 11mm and it is BIG. Moving from a 5mm thick Skagen watch to this, you can really notice the difference. It's equal to 0.433"", so get a ruler and measure it on your wrist first before taking the plunge. It's almost embarrassingly thick. How can a modern day watch be so thick? I've seen other Eco-Drive watches that are way thinner than this. Maybe that's why this watch is only $129. I'm on the verge of returning it because of this."
4,Great little watch,"I really like this watch. I will say that I bought it with the intention of replacing the band with a brown leather one, and I'm glad I did. You may like the whole nylon strap look, but the riveted holes just seemed obtrusive and a bit much for me. That having been said, a $20 leather band from my local watch shop made this baby look like a watch that costs twice as much. I have smallish wrists, and its not always easy to find a watch that doesnt look way too big, but this guy looks great!My only gripe is that the stopwatch second hand actually rests about one second behind the 12, but whatever thats not a huge deal.Just a heads up: if you're looking to buy a new band for this watch, the product description is wrong. It says that the band width is 21mm, but when I took it into the shop they measured and it actually would only fit a 20mm. You have been warned!"
5,"Great watch,very durable","Bought this watch for my brother in December, 2009. He swapped out the band for a one-piece military style canvas, and has worn it every day since then. No problems with the watch so far! It's 3 years later and he is still very happy with the gift!"
2,eco-drive watch,Watch was nice but I don't where same watch everday so it kept losing power and I returned after a week.
1,Over Priced & Feels Cheap,"I was curious about eco drive and this looked nice online but after owning many invictas this watch feels and looks very cheap. Chronograph feels and works like crap compaired to the swiss ones in my invictas. Band is very short, case is too small and too light. I wouldnt pay more than 60 bucks for this watch. For the same price they want you can buy this better invicta comparable...which is what I ended up doing.http://www.amazon.com/Invicta-Force-Collection-Lefty-Military/dp/B0009P66TK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=watches&qid;=1282003264&sr;=1-1#productPromotions"
2,Disappointing...,"I was really excited when I received this watch as a gift from my wife. The style is exactly what I was looking for, and the Eco-Drive is great. I have to admit though, after only two weeks of use, I am fairly disappointed. I replaced the strap almost immediately, which I found to be very stiff and uncomfortable. Also, the chronograph controls feel ""sticky"" and cheap. I can only describe the button feel as rough. Finally, my biggest problem with this watch is the face. After 2 weeks, there are scratches all over it. The crystal is unacceptable for a watch with a list price over $200.00. I really wanted to love this watch, but the quality is below acceptable, so I had to give 2 stars.Citizen Men's AT0200-05E Eco-Drive Chronograph Canvas Watch"
3,Nice watch,"The watch face is big enough to read easily, and I like that the big red second hand is part of the stopwatch function, not the watch itself.However, the date function is way too small to read, inset into that tiny window on the watch face. And all three of the small dials: seconds, 24-hour hours, and minutes on the stopwatch function, are difficult to read and often totally blocked from view by the minute and hour hands.And I do like the solar-powered quartz feature -- no batteries to replace and no worries about winding the watch.If you want a good analog watch face with a decent stopwatch, this could be your watch.TH"
4,Nice Watch.,Well I have been wearing this watch for about a month now and I'm very happy with it. I was a little worried about the band but it is actually very nice. Well constructed and its comfortable. Face is easy to read but the date window is a waste of time. I have good vision and I can't read it. That's the only reason I did not give this watch 5 stars. The fact that its solar powered is nice also. No changing batteries.
4,Attractive watch,"This is a nice, basic watch and I'm happy to have it in my collection. Even though it has a chronograph, it is very easy to read (not very busy).I found the included band is not nearly as small as some of the reviewers suggested (and I'm not a small guy). I did replace it with a black band, but I do plan on keeping the band it came with.I would have given it 5 stars if the glow in the dark features would last longer"
5,I like it,It's a great looking waterproof watch and the battery never runs out.Note: I put a Zulu band on it. See customer images.It looks and works better than the stock band but it sets off the metal detector at the airport.
4,Great watch,"Awesome watch. Strap is too military like, but if the exact same strap was black, it would be perfect 5 stars."
2,"Decent Watch, but fragile","Amending my review to reflect reality. This watch works as promised and is great as a chronometer. But I dropped it from about chest level and not only did the dial crack and chip, the watch hands got jammed with one another such that the watch didn't run.So its a decent watch, but you have to be careful with it."
2,Big clunker,"The watch has been a real disappointment. It is accurate with understated looks (which I like). The watch face is huge and the entire watch is a real clunker. Whenever I go to look at it to get the time the watch has rolled around to the top side of my left wrist requiring me to use my right hand to move the watch face back into view to check the time! The band's grommet holes are too widely spaced so either the band is too loose or too tight. One of the main reasons I got the watch was so I could use the stop watch feature. This has proved impractical as timing is limited to one hour and the hand that shows the minute count is so small and poorly laid out that it can be difficult to read (e.g., is the wacth showing 7 minutes or 8)!"
2,Ayden's toy,This product viewing window is too small. It is not very engaging or interactive. I purchased for my son when he was turning 3 yrs old. Maybe my expectations were too high.
2,you get what you pay for (or less),"Considering the cost of this product, I didn't have very high expectations but still found myself disappointed. The chest plate, shin guards, and cod piece are all made out of flimsy foam and were completely bent out of shape from the way they were packaged. I thought they would at least be cheap solid plastic. I ended up hacking/modifying this costume with other accessories that I've bought and personally fabricated to make it slightly usable.Another design flaw is the sizing. The belt seems to be made for someone with a 60"" waist while the suit itself is so tight I felt like I was getting a wedgie the whole time I wore it.The only higher quality suit i can find is the $800 version. I really wish there was something in-between. I would recommend avoiding this item if you have even a casual interest in quality."
1,CAUTION! I ordered this and it didnt come as labled!,"This is a delayed review, however I feel obligated to warn people before buying this... I ordered this product for a Halloween costume, the shipping was fast, and I got it a few days before Halloween... However, it wasn't what I ordered. I ordered the Deluxe Darth Vader - Standard - Chest Size 36-40, and I received a regular Darth Vader costume. I will say that the price was surprisingly low compared to the other ""Deluxe"" costumes, which is why I bought it, but little did I know, it wasn't even the costume I wanted, and nor did it match the picture... In addition some of the product that did come, came ripped, and torn! I'm very dissatisfied, and annoyed that I had to settle with this incorrectly labeled product for my costume, since it was not what I ordered. I will now avoid buying from Fox Martin Corp. since I can no longer trust their product labels."
2,Not what I expected for the high price,Thought this costume was gonna be better qualityt then it was it was just a oversized kid costume I paid alot for this cheap fabric rubber and foam and just gonna end up putting it together myself using some of the add ons plus it was rolled up into the package as if it was tried on by ppl in a store then stuck in a box and mailed to me and im not even gonna get started on the mask lol so glad I already own a electronic vader mask and helmet
3,Pretty good!,"My husband wore this costume this halloween. Overall he was very happy with it. The only negative is the mask. It is very hard to see out of the eyes so you really can't walk around with the mask on for to long. The back of the mask is open so you will need to get a ski-mask or hood of some sort to complete the costume.Positives: The cape was fantastic and really moved when my husband walked. The kids in the neighborhood loved this costume!I was glad that this costume came in a extra large size. My husband is 200 pounds and 6'2"". The regular would have been to small."
5,fun and historical,"I bought this brand new over 20 years ago, and have loved reading it over and over since I bought it. Being a fan of older air power, this book is TONS of fun!!!"
3,trf goes TRF with a YU-KI-centric song,"For ""Hey! Ladies & Gentlemen"", the group quickly returned to a synth pop song and no longer using the live house band.Unlike past TRF songs that had unique transitions in its music, ""Hey! Ladies & Gentlemen"" was very subdued and simple compared to their past singles.The song was definitely a YU-KI-centric song which spotlighted on mostly YU-KI's vocals.In fact, the music video for ""Hey! Ladies & Gentlemen"" featured only YU-KI as she is driving her car and taking photos in another country.For those wanting the original style of sound of TRF, the BUFFALO MIX of ""Hey! Ladies and Gentlemen"" was definite a nice addition to this CD single.This CD single is also the first time that TRF was used instead of the lowercase ""trf"".Personally, as much as I enjoyed the song earlier on, I really craved the fast pace music that I was used to hearing from TRF."
4,Good book.,"Very interesting book, worth a read...from any source. I would recommend it for someone with a firm stomach though, it does get kind of graphic."
2,Very disappointing,"Sorry Mrs Roach, though others enjoyed it, I thought this was a really poor effort on a topic that held a lot of potential. There were a few interesting tidbits, but generally I felt this book was boring, uninformative and often strayed from the topic. Chapter 7 alone was spent taking a swipe at a portion of the population and nothing to do with a dead body. When reading this I could tell that Roach reads a lot of Bill Bryson. Unfortunately, she was unable to come close his humor. One smile from me while reading this would have earned her an extra star."
2,so-so,"I decided to read this book becasue of its acclaim and an ongoing interest in death/afterlife situations. Like very few of the other reviewers I found this book to not be very funny and even had trouble understanding some of the humor. Some of the chapters were very interesting, while others I felt I was dragging myself through them. All in all, if you are interested in a subject addressed by Roach in this book I would recommmend finding a better source, i.e. if you want to know about ""The BOdy Farm"" read Bass' Death's Acre. I think any interested reader would be happy reading the entire book than Roach's chapter on the subject."
2,Lose the flippant descriptions of animal experimentation,"A friend lent me Stiff, and I had high hopes for it since she said it was so clever and interesting, and usually our tastes run very much in tandem. I was really turned off by the (I felt) gratuitous descriptions of how animals were used in experimentation. I don't know if I would have found her treatment of the subject matter disrespectful regardless, but that certainly cast things in a negative tone for me, and I ended up unable to finish it because I was so disturbed. The subject matter was interesting, I just didn't find her humor funny enough to distract me from the disrespect."
2,STIFF writing,"This book started out with a bang and by midway had dragged itself out to a barely audible wimper. The subject matter is very interesting but the execution is tedious, with the morgue humor sprinkled throughout more groan worthy than chuckle inducing. Overall, this book was long and dull."
1,Unreliable resources,"I bought this book and was amazed at the sort of historical things described. And so, like any enthusiast, I did research. And very sadly I discovered that a good deal of the historical background does not exist. I mention especially the description of ""Mellification"" in Chapter 10. The author didn't make any of it up herself, but simply used many poor and unreliable sources as her basis."
2,Only slightly entertaining/informative,"While the idea of this book is quite a hook, the contents and writing style are mediocre at best. Maybe a long article for a magazine like People, but the book is another one of those with lots of filler, lots of space between lines and virtually no meaningful content. I definitely would not recommend it."
1,This book stinks worse than a 30 day old cadaver!!!,"In years past, I have read Mary Roach in Readers Digest and found her pretty funny!! I did not find anything she wrote in this book to be funny. In this book, she writes like an adolescent boy who is determined to shock his adolescent friends at every turn of the page. If I could take away her computer until she grows up, I believe that would be a fitting punishment. The best I can do for this book is to put it in the recycle bin and hope the paper will be used for a better cause in the future."
2,You Cut Off Heads!,"Good idea, but a bit draggy and long-winded. For such a macabre subject, I just thought the writing could have been more compelling and sympathetic. Didn't keep me riveted."
5,Things to Do When You're Dead,"Don't let death be the end of your experiences in life! Mary Roach tells, with respect, humor, and occasionally gruesome detail, about the many things you might find yourself doing when dead. It's an entertaining and enlightening read, but be advised that some parts aren't recommended for those with weak stomachs."
5,Great book club book!,"Our bookclub selected this book to read for our last meeting. We had the best discussions about so many different topics. I would recommend it on that aspect alone.I didn't know what this book was about when we selected it. I thought it was a novel. Boy was I surprised when I found out that it was actually a book about cadavers and what happens to them. This was a very entertaining, enlightening and thought provoking book. I definitely recommend it. But, might I also recommend . . . don't read certain chapters while eating."
5,Fascinating,"Not really a non-fiction book reader, but this book was just so damn interesting. I couldn't put it down. It also made me re-evaluate my own plans for when I expire."
5,this book is badass,"I loved this book. I love Mary Roach's style: innocent, brilliant, funny, naive. She just nails it every time. This book was so great. It was really easy to read, like reading a long magazine article. I read it a year ago and still think of things I learned from it from time to time. The subject is dead bodies, but Roach handles it with just the right grace, respect, and humor. I was beyond impressed."
3,A fun adventure!,"This book took a serious subject that we have all secretely thought about and made it into a fun adventure! I honestly had not thought about all the good that comes from cadaver research - it is amazing what they do and how they contribute after they are gone. I don't know if I would do it myself, but if I hear of someone else doing it I will think of it in a different light. Funny, interesting and a real page-turner - I liked this book."
5,Unexpectedly comforting,"Being unconvinced of an afterlife, at least of the harps and mansions variety, I find death pretty unnerving. The only time I ever felt positive about the coming end was while reading Mary Roach's wonderful book. Humorous and conversational, yet NEVER disrespectful or flippant, Stiff is a wonderful journey through a topic we may rather not think about, but all wonder about. Fascinating, heart-warming, informative and reassuring are not adjectives you would expect to apply to a book about death, but they all apply to Stiff.....can't recommend this enough."
5,Creepy but interesting,"Interesting subject that is rarely covered. Author seemed very immersed in her topic, and has a dry irreverent sense of humor that serves the subject well."
4,A little gross and a lot entertaining,"Recommended by my sister who is an EMT and involved in health sciences, I found this book to be a surprisingly interesting and fun read for those interested in the quirkier side of medicine."
4,Corpse-a-palooza,- What happens when a body is donated to science?- What are the nuts and bolts of decomposition?- What are the proper steps of embalming and subsequent cosmetic presentation of the body?...And these questions are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg in this great account of the genuine uses and abuses of cadavers in contemporary society as well as throughout history. Roach has the perfect sort of inquiring and unflinching mind for a complete exploration of her topic. Gory at parts...but if that is surmountable the reader will find him or herself on a fascinating and (YES!) funny journey. It's the sort of book that provides LOTS of gasps as well as many amazing and surreal facts for to share!!!
4,Deft Handling of a Delicate Subject,"Humorous, touching, informative, respectful, intriguing. It would be hard to write a book with these combined elements under normal circumstances. Throw in the fact that the book is about cadavers, and that's a virtually impossible feat. But Roach somehow manages to pull it off.I kept waiting to be offended by something that was just way too over the top, but I never was. I was queasy a time or two, but the darn book was too intriguing for me to put it down. She did a wondeful job of handling a very sensitive subject.Made for a great read on a long trip to and from New York. Make sure you keep the cover hidden unless you want either lots of interruptions from people asking you about the book or weird looks from those who assume you are deranged."
5,Required reading for any funeral types out there,"Being employed in the deathcare industry, when I stumbled across this book in my local Borders I just had to pick it up. The jacket reeled me in; my sense of humor is about as dark as the author's and of course it came home with me. And I didn't put it down until I'd finished it. It's thoroughly engrossing, as addicting as heroin, and probably the funniest thing I've read in years. Yet it manages to maintain the dignity of -- and even a reverence for -- the dead throughout. Mary Roach manages to show us that death isn't such a bad thing, really, and for me at least gives hope that I'll be able to contribute to the world even after my departure. There's only one downside to this book: if you lend it to someone, you can expect to have to fight for its return."
5,"For those who want to know ""What happens?""","I think deep down we're all curious about death. What happens when we're buried?, cremated?, or what if I donate my body to science? The answers are all there, plus more -stuff you never would have thought to ask about.An uncomfortable subject, yes. Entertaining -definitely. This book is well written and informal, not morbid at all. One minute your jaw will be on the floor, the next you'll be laughing. I can't imagine how such information could be presented in a better (less threatening, more entertaining) way.If you're curious, buy it, just skip the chapters you may not be ready for such as: ""Just a Head: Decapitation, reanimation, and the human head transplant"". But don't skip ""Out of the Fire, into the Compost Bin: And other new ways to end up"", this chapter discusses the future of dealing with the dead, I find the ""Recycling"" option particularly interesting and would sign up immediately if it were available today."
3,So excited at first...,UNTIL I SAW THAT MUCH OF THE BOOK contained the graphic and sickening details of animal testing. As an animal activist it was simply too difficult to read much of the book since in several chapters details are given on the use of animals in various tests while they are alive. Outside of the animal cruelty there is no denying there are some amazing facts in this book.A great read just be warned if you are sensitive with the subject of animal testing this may not be the book for you..
5,Highly informative,"This book is an amazing compilation of all the facts you could ever want about death and what happens thereafter. The book gives a new perspective to the subject and helps the reader understand the mechanical aspects of being deceased.Having lost both parents recently and having donated my father's body, it was really fascinating to find out the adventures he may have gone on afterwards and it helped me come to terms with my mother's cremains.It's great to find a book that deals with these touchy subjects without resorting to the easy out of superstition and religious belief systems.If text books were written in this style, we'd all have enjoyed high school and actually learned the subject matter."
5,Fun reading at lunchtime...,"OK, look. I read books when I'm at lunch by myself, right? So, loudly cracking up and laughing isn't uncommon for me. But with this book, I actually had someone lean across the aisle and ask me what I was reading. When I told him ""it's a book about dead bodies"" he quickly left the cafe....It's hysterically funny, but also touching and respectful and lovely. If you are squeamish, there are passages that might be a little too much, but overall, it was quite good and straightforward. I am prone to nightmares, but had none while reading this book."
3,"Interesting, but ...","_Stiff_ is well researched, and provides an abundance of information on the fascinating details about what happens to our bodies when we die. Details about the use of cadavers in medical experiments (anatomy labs, their use in forensics, organ donations and as crash test dummies) were for me the most interesting and the strongest parts of the book. The rest of it (the use of corpses in decapitation experiments, crucifixion, plastination and in various medicinal concotions) did not hold my attention as the medical applications did.I also had trouble with Roach's humor. Perhaps it was her way of lightening up a serious (and no doubt unpleasant and uncomfortable) topic. Several other reviewers didn't mind it, and even enjoyed it, so I suspect it is just me on this one - but I simply didn't ""get"" her humor.Either way, it is a fascinating book, and a worthwhile read, but I far prefered Jessica Snyder Sach's _Corpse_."
5,"A lovely, fun, witty, informative read!","I heard about this book from some friends & practically ran out to buy it, it sounded so ... unique. I mean, how many nontechnical books on cadavers have you read lately? Happily, ""Stiff"" lived up to all of my expectations! Mary Roach has a cheerful, breezy style that effectively counterpoints the unsettling (to some) nature of her subject. (Her footnotes in particular were a welcome addition; sort of reminiscent of Will Cuppy.) I found myself frequently laughing out loud. I also found myself frequently reading parts of this book out loud to my wife and friends. My wife finally told me to shut up because I was spoiling the book for her.Do yourself a favor and buy ""Stiff"". (Don't wonder about whether it's the sort of book you'd be interested in; you're reading this review, aren't you?) Trust me. You'll laugh, you'll occasionally feel tearful, and you'll painlessly learn quite a lot. It's a fine book!"
3,Unusal,"This is one of the most craziest books I ever read in my whole life time. It's funny and very unusal how an author can write about dead bodies. I feel that the book was very interesing but not my type of book. I thought it will be about only one certain body, the author talks more on different bodies.One of the things I learn about the book that the dead bodies are not pratice by the surgeons. Only very experienced surgeons can operate on the donated cadavers and the students can just watch, unless the experienced surgeon ask for help from the student. This part was interesting because I thought that students can examine these dead bodies with just someone there if they needed any help. The book is very good to read and I recommend it to people that are interest in dead bodies that want to be surgeons.By, Leoncio"
3,Mixed Feelings,"Each chapter in this book covers a different topic. Some topics were more interesting than others and some informationI was appalling.The topic of experiments with animals was disturbing. None the less, the options we have after our lifeforce leaves our body is fascinating. After reading this book I'm considering donating my body to science."
5,Mary Roach is an astoundingly funny down-to-earth natural at reporting.,This book is PHENOMENAL. Do not hesitate to pick it up. You won't be disappointed.
3,"Good, clinical and scientific information","This is my first time reading a book by Mary Roach. I found ""Stiff"" to be interesting, in a text book sort of way. While some may find it downright gastly, I found it had good information. It is clear that the author does thorough research. She discussed the history of how cadavers are treated and then moved to modern day uses of cadavers. I had heard this was a funny book. I disagree. I think there were moments of decent tongue-in-cheek humor, but overall I found the reading of it rather dry. Now, I have a scientific mind and found the science of it all very interesting. But, I wouldn't recommend this as an entertaining read. That being said, my book club is planning to have a themed dinner surrounding this book. We have also invited a mortician to join us, so that we might pummel the poor man with questions. Now, THAT sounds like a lot of fun."
5,Mary Roach's Very Best,"To me, this book represents some of the very best nonfiction writing out there.I felt like I was listening to a very close friend throughout the whole book, and more thanonce caught myself saying out aloud, ""OMG, you did WHAT?""A very memorable, outstanding and funny book which I will value for a very long time, andkeep for my children (until they come of age)."
3,It was OK,"Overall, this book was OK -- the first few chapters were certainly what I expected, but I found myself trudging through the closing chapters with limited interest.I found the author's writing style to be distracting bordering on annoying; she tended to change tense from past to present (writing about a past experience in the present tense is a pet peeve of mine), and she apparently could not resist the urge to insert smarmy remarks either within the text or as a footnote at the bottom of the page. The book was absolutely full of her ""humorous"" musings which added little to the quality, in my opinion. Lastly, the closing chapters tended to be somewhat disjointed; she had the tendency to get off on tangents partially or completely unrelated to the topic of the chapter.It is hard to believe this book received a serious editorial review prior to publication."
4,"Unusual book, to say the least","Not for the squeamish. Well written, informative, macabre humor with a political twist and more than you ever wanted or needed to know about the fate of human remains. The author walks on grounds soaked with the fluids of human decay, visits funeral parlors to learn the tricks of the trade, and travels to China in search of cannibalism. If detailed essays on body snatchers, liquified brains and corpse flatulence sound like fun, this book's for you."
3,"Should be called ""Cruelty to Animals in the name of Science""","The book is funny, except for the parts that made my stomach hurt about the things we do to animals. There is a lot in here about what has been done to animals, and what is still being done to them, it breaks my heart. I don't mind experimentation on dead animals but it should be illegal to do anything to a living animal, no matter who it benefits, and I can say that if an animal experiment would have saved my mother I (nor she) would have signed off on it. If it were to save my life I say no, we don't have the right. For the most part the book is funny and educational."
3,"Very informative, but redundant.","It was s good read. I had a lot of questions answered, and learned some good information. I even had a couple of chuckles."
5,Great Audio Book--Just Not During Lunch!,"You can imagine what a surreal experience it was to listen to this book on CD while on a house cleaning job...scraping goo off the stove while listing to the description of body putrification after death.Yep, I, too, laughed out loud at the writer's wry humor.I did have to stop listening while eating my lunch in the car while driving. I did want to keep it down, after all.I just wanted to comment on the Audio Book reader: very good choice. She handles the dry humor well, with the right intonation and inflection. I good story can be ruined by a bad reader, and Shelly Frasier is excellent.If you are in the habit of listening to books on the drive home, get this one for sure. Your drive will go quickly."
5,Hysterical and Enlightening Look at the Dead,"Mary Roach takes an interesting look at human cadavers and the ways in which they help the living. Roach is absolutely hysterical. She brings a quirky sense of humor to a topic that is heavy and often hard to talk about. I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this book, but I am really glad that I did. It was a truly exceptional read."
4,Somewhat morbid..but entertaining,"This book to me is like a car wreck, you want to look away but you find yourself looking closer. I don't know for sure what I expected, but I do feel like it lived up to or maybe even exceeded my expectations. I found myself not wanting to read, yet I couldn't put it down. I have questioned why that is. I think because on some level we all have a fear of death. To look in in the eye through this book can be somewhat scary, yet sometimes quite comedic. I believe that most people will find this book repulsive..but will find themselves being drawn in and mesmerized at the same time. It is very well written with, what I consider to be, laughable lines here and there thrown in by the author in order to break some of the tension. I have to admit that I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good read."
3,Helter Skelter,"Although the stories and true information detailed in this book are fascinating, the author jumps erratically from location-to-location and interviewee-to-interviewee. It is often difficult to keep track of whom or even where the author is when they recount their experiences. Some of the stories are related in a manner which is for sensationalism alone without an underlying explanation. A more linear and chronological format with a proper index would have upped this book from a mere novel to an intro work for students entering various medical fields."
3,"So,so",I felt it was a little to Technical to be an easy smooth read for me.But that it;s to say I didn;t enjoy the read.A little to slow of a read for my taste.
5,Very Interesting Read,Really interesting read. I had a hard time putting it down even though at times I wanted to. Everyone has this subject in common so everyone should enjoy the book.
4,why do we do this?,"tThis is a most detailed book on how we treat bodies. I read it in two days, totally mesmerized at the treatment of stiffs. If you are ever thinking of donating your body to science I would recommend reading this book. the part where they cut of a head off and brought it back to life is scary.Don""t think for a moment that your body parts are treated with any kind of dignity, the whole body is used for every kind of exsperiment you can think of, and more.Be prepared when you open the book, you are grabbed from the first page to the end. mlewis"
5,Rice Krispies????,"You know, I think she had me when she said in a footnote that while she agreed with organ & tissue donation, she preferred not to spend her hereafter as someone's underpants. I laughed out loud and kept on laughing. Not to give anything away, but the whole Rice Krispies & chicken soup thing out of chapter 3 was a scream. I did not know non-fiction could be so entertaining. It's not often that a book inspires me to read aloud to my roommate (who probably wishes I wouldn't), but this one did. I can't give it enough praise. Way to go Mary!!"
2,Yawn....,"This book's title suggests an interesting read, but I promise if you know anything about forensic pathology, this book is incredibly boring. If you watch TV shows like CSI and think you know about forensic pathology, you probably would like this book. I work in a forensic pathology department and I found this book hard to read, as the author veers off topic quite a bit. I found myself skipping entire sections (especially when she goes into talking about ballistics gel for what seemed like eternity). If you have a higher level of education, I recommend reading some of the books she uses in her bibilography. I found this book was written for someone who knew absolutely nothing about decendents. I recommend reading Death's Acre if you would like a more professional description. Most of the material in Stiff is general knowledge to people who have a background in pathology and anatomy. I found this book quite dull."
1,Interesting subject - Dull writing style,"I love medicine, anatomy, and anything to do with the workings of the human body and have looked forward to reading 'Stiff' since it was first published. BIG disappointment.While the subject matter is interesting and well-researched, the writing style has made it almost impossible for me to drag myself through this book. I'm giving up half way through after deciding that I just can't face another day of ""one page at a time"" drudgery.Aside from the occasional quip or aside this book is written in the short, choppy, dull, dry style of the dreaded textbook. Even some of the most intriguing topics have been rendered lifeless. Unless you feel absolutely compelled to learn this specific information, or you particularly enjoy reading textbooks, I don't recommend it."
4,Stiff,This was a very interesting book. It was unlike anything I have ever read. Mary Roach described the many uses for cadavers with great humor. This gave me a different perspective on cadavers.
4,gross!!!... cool...,"It's kinda hard to say this is a recommendation for people to read, it's GROSS, unsettling and repulsive. Yet, I enjoyed this book. The humor is... off, but I laughed, a lot more than maybe I should have, but it was funny. It's certainly researched, it's informative, we all will suffer from it, so why not read about it. I've read horror books and true crime and other genres, but this is the only book that I read that made my shudder, but then, afterwards, wow, that's interesting. I had to read it for the ""see how much I can take"" kinda thing, but the humor off set it enough to be ok. Not that I'm overly squimish, but still, with things likee 30 heads on trays was kinda unsettling"
2,Deep Six It,"Given that I'm a medical examiner, so maybe it's me, but I have to say that I didn't enjoy this book. I'd bought it for a friend after seeing it on a re-run of Six Feet Under. The author's descriptions seem stilted to me and she never got close to her subject nor did she seem to bother to delve beyond the surface. I kept waiting for the much touted hilarity and it never came (and trust me, morgue rats are a jokey bunch).In addition, Roach seemed to have some kind of running feud with Catholics which kept surfacing inexplicably--maybe she could save that for another overwhelmingly hilarious book?"
3,Many Bright Spots,"Certain sections of this book I absolutely LOVED, and other sections I felt could have either been left out or at least needed to be rewritten/edited.The stuff about the Body Farm is worth the cover price alone."
2,Stiff,"I thought this book would interst me as I am donating my body after death. What it did was to make me wonder if I really want to do this. Some of the graphic details of cadavers was too much as was the history of what has been done with bodies.I hardly ever quit reading a book, but I did with this one."
3,Great for random facts to interject into conversations,"Very, um............ interesting I guess would be the word.A pretty good book. I was only bored to tears at one point, which is unusual for me, and that was chapter 6: The Cadaver Who Joined the Army.At no point was I revolted or disturbed with matters concerning the cadavers; I was, however, disturbed by the historical recollection of treatment of animals by means of experimentation. Some of it was terribly cruel - and most certainly a history I could NOT read about.Overall the book was pretty good. It kept my attention but wasn't one of the books that I just couldn't put down. If you're in to strange pieces of non-fiction like I am, give it a go. You'll walk away with some pretty interesting ideas for conversation."
4,Facinating and informative,"Mary Roach has managed to expose readers to an informative and scientific look at human cadavers all with a reverential outlook. This book identifies the many ways that cadavers are used for a variety of things from medicine to car safety. It also identifies the many different ways bodies are used when donated for scientific research purposes. At the same time, it incorporates a sophisticated humor that entertains the reader and keeps the pages turning without disgracing the deceased indivduals who have found themselves the subject of this book.This book will appeal to the interests of many different readers, and will undoubtedly make you think about the direction you would like your body to go in once you have passed on."
4,very good book,"My anatomy teacher recommended this book as an interesting read and it proved to be one for sure. It shows that it is possible to find humor in almost anything, and does a very good job of explaining almost all of the different things that human cadavers are used for while still keeping a light mood throughout the book."
4,Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers,"Excellent book . . . I would have liked her to have vocused MORE on her personal experiences (which was humerous and informative). Used ""to muchtime"" on explanations of the history of the feild . . . Which lost myinterest at several points in the book."
3,Book looked well loved,"I got a really great deal on this book. The cover was a bit worn out, but it was still great. I'm reading it now."
3,Interesting... but makes your stomach churn,"Lots of interesting facts and I was impressed at how the author managed to write about this subject. Seriously, if someone told me they were going to write a book about cadavers and it was going to be a best seller, I wouldn've thought they were crazy. That being said, Mary Roach did manage to write a best selling book on the subject, although some of the information and description of the facts made my stomach churn. Maybe I'm just squeamish, but her descriptions on the way the human cadaver were used throughout history made me a bit nauseous. Also, I don't know why people thought this book was hilarious. Interesting maybe, but hilarious? I don't see it. Some of the facts she uncovered were amusing (in an interesting way,) but I didn't fall down laughing. If you're interested in knowing what happens to human cadavers and has a strong stomach, then this book is pretty informative, but if you want a funny book, go somewhere else."
5,LOVE IT,"I brought this book to the court house when I had jury duty before I read it and immediately felt embarassed by the title! I thought, these people are going to think Im weird and morbid reading a book about dead bodies! I opened the cover and started reading and I coulnd't put it down! I didn't care if people thought I was sick, this was a good book! It is funny, informative and desensitizes you a little to death, making you think it as something everyone goes through regardless of factors. I can;t say enough about it and I will never stop recommending it!"
3,Just OK - I expected more,"I bought this book after seeing and hearing the author being interviewed on John Stewart and on NPR, talking about her newest book about astronauts. I don't like to pay the price of new books so looked for an earlier book that I could buy in paperback. The reviews on Stiff were very good so I bought it. Well, I found myself agreeing with the other 3-star reviews that said it started good but got tedious about halfway through."
5,Fantastic book!,"""Stiff"" by Mary Roach was an awesome read. What an interesting subject to write about. This book was truly fascinating and it covered a topic I think a lot of people are curious about: What becomes of our bodies once we died. I didn't realize there were so many rituals and options available once we pass away.Mary Roach's style of writing is so smart and witty. I like being able to learn and laugh at the same time. She has a terrific sense of humour that is appropriate for the subject matter. She's apparently written other books, which I plan to check out. I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious about what happens to dead bodies or to anyone who just wants something interesting and entertaining to read."
4,Hard to put down,"Though I think by most standards I took a bit longer to finish the book, I did finish it within about 5 days reading a few hours a night. If you're fascinated by the morbid and unsettling draw of forensics, this is the book to read. I have to say, after reading ""Stiff"", I now have a different view of what death ultimately holds for us all. It doesn't have to be the end. The book itself is very easy to read and is quite enthralling - to the point that I lost sleep those 5 nights I was reading it.I gave it 4 stars mainly because there were sections in the book that were a bit dry and slow, but I tend to enjoy the more morbid details when it comes to this topic. Regardless, I highly recommend it."
3,humor in death?,"Although I found this book extremely interesting it wasn't ""hillarious"" as I had heard. If fact, I found it qwuite morbid. The only humerous part were the personal footnote she occationally writes throughout the story. It was very analytical about dying and funerals and donating your body to science vs creamation and all the specifics of each ""choice""."
3,Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers,"An interesting, funny and educational book. I teach Anatomy & Physiology and have included the book as part of the curriculum."
2,Stiff,This book becomes boring after awhile. It is interesting but not for the faint hearted or anyone who has nightmares.
5,Where do donated bodies go? What happens next?,"Funny and informative; perfect for weird people (like me!) who find this stuff interesting, rather than gross! Answers questions you never knew you had!"
3,Book,The highly rated novel failed to contain as much ridiculosity and hilariosity as its previous readers once informed me. Read it if you like books.
5,The light in death,"I loved how the satire within this book was shared among the living and dead. Of course death is no joke, but Roach was able to put a humorous spin on the topic with a somewhat awkward innocence - humanized she as an author, especially considering the subject and sciences behind it all.I didn't leave the light on to go to sleep, nor did I pee the bed. This book wasn't a horror STORY, or from the head of an unhinged individual. Simply an ""It is what it is"", and, well, ""Here it is!""If you want FACT, and a new perspective on what happens AFTER life, highly recommend. Not a disappointing or complicated read."
4,"Appealing, for a book about death","What happens when you die? Literally - to your body. What if your plane blows up and your body falls to the ground. What. Literally. Happens. To. It.Hope you have the stomach to read all about it.This book is funny and appealing, for a book about death!"
5,More than you knew you wanted to know,"This book is both funny and fascinating. As someone who works in the medical field and has been at cadaver labs, I am maybe not as squeamish as other people. But even those people who are will find the stories of head-transplant studies and accident reconstruction more interesting than ""gross""."
5,Enjoyed it very much,"Others tell about the contents - let me just add that I enjoyed reading it, and laughing now and then while learning some very interesting facts about cadavers."
2,Needs updating - badly,"Excellent idea, nicely executed, but 4 years is too long for a book like this not to be updated. About half of the restaurants/shops listed are no longer in existence. Much of the remaining information is no longer accurate.It does provide a somewhat surreal experience to follow a map to an address only to find a car dealership where you expect a leather boutique to be. Otherwise i'm afraid this edition is fairly useless."
5,NuJoi Is A Rare Gem,"I thoroughly enjoyed this project when it was new. I used to play several cuts at the skating rink on Gospel sessions - I Wanna Be Yours, God Says Wait (lots of skate requests), Share The Love (lots of skate requests), and Unto The Lord. I've waited a long time for more music from them (I'm still waiting... :-)). I love their familial blend; it made for such unique sounding harmonies. God bless them--wherever they are! :-)"
4,"Love the CD, hate that i bought it USED","I love this CD, and have looked for it for so long. The prices they were trying to sell it as new were ridiculous, so i took my chances on a new one. Needless to say, the first song, one of my favorites, didn't play. When it comes to cd's, i'd recommend buying new...at least it will play"
3,KYA SAYAN KA VEDON PER KIYA GAYA BHASYA TRUTI RAHIT HAI?,"The re are many ancient persons who wrote commentry on vedas either partially or completely.A few commentries are available at present.But fortunately the translation and /or commentry written by sayanacharya on all the four vedas is available.Most of the modern indian scholers are following the vedas explained by sayan.But in 19th century the great reformer""swamy dayananda sarswati critically examined them,and find out so many mistakes which defames the glory of vedas.Then onwords the followers of aryasamaj are criticising and bycoting the vedas with sayans translation>shree jitendrakumar's book is of course a valueble book,enlightening the common person about vedas and simultaneously warning him towords the mistakes of sayan. I fully appriciate shri jitendra prasad for his book and wish all vedic scholers to read this book and make their decision about vedas. spsharma"
3,"Lots of interesting facts, but true Bond fans should pass...","I recently purchased this book and found that most of the information is correct. Whoever edited the book did a lousy job (these people should learn how to spell S-C-A-R-A-M-A-N-G-A). Also, a few facts are totally fictitious. In one part, it lists all of the automobiles driven by Bond in films. It doesen't even mention that Bond drove his Aston Martin to M:I-6 headquarters in Tommorow Never Dies. After skimming through the book, the thought crossed my mind that these guys might not have even seen all of the Bond films."
5,A must have for serious Bond fans!,"This book is packed with information about James Bond and it includes everything you would want to know and more. It gives a synopsis of the storyline in each James Bond novel and movie. It lists all the women, all the villains, all the weapons and gadgets that he used. It also give a brief biographical sketch of all the actors who played the role of 007. This book even gives a physical description of James Bond as he appears in the novel, the clothes he wears, and the things that he likes. In short, this book has everything from A - Z regarding James Bond. If you are an avid fan of 007, you would really enjoy reading this book!"
2,The Facts were not Researched Enough,"Although impressive in scope, this is not the first time an author has attempted an A-Z listing of all things ""Bondian."" Although the authors do score with some interesting compilations, such as number of men Bond's killed per movie, or a concise summary of the movie and book locations, time is also spent rehashing movie and book plots, several of which were laden with errors which makes one wonder if they watched the movie or just wrote the book from memory. Overall, not an impressive volume."
4,Drama as a Prevention Tool for Teens,"Drama and the Adolescent Journey is a wonderful resource to address ways to proactively engage teens in their own growth process through drama and the creative arts. The authors, Linda Nelson, RDT and Lanell Finneran, RDT/BCT, bring a wide range of knowledge to this book, both having worked with adolescents within the public school system for years. This book is geared, not toward clinical populations, but toward the typical adolescents one might meet anywhere and offers developmental theory and practical hands-on techniques to assist with the journey. The focus is on drama therapy for prevention with youth as opposed to drama therapy as intervention and it is written from the perspective of strengthening normal development as a means of avoiding the development of abnormal behavior. Chapters 6 and 7 in particular offer many useful creative arts therapies activities for use in exploring adolescent issues."
1,So bad it's . . . really bad,"I'm a fan of Christina Ricci and dark comedies, yet I found this film damn near unwatchable. The only things intriguing about it are why the actors agreed to do it, why it was made, and why, after the backers presumably saw the finished product, it was released. The film itself gets no stars; my one star is for Ricci's presence.For Ricci completists only, and then I recommend it be viewed with the sound off so that no one need listen to the dialogue."
3,Ricci is hot!,"I bought this DVD because Christina Ricci was in it - pure and simple. It's a strange film and not for everyone but it's Ricci's sexiest role yet( arguably ) so that's why I bought it. Ricci plays many roles and you need to see through the fog to know what's going on. Has a hollywood ending but it's worth it just for Ricci. If your a Christina Ricci fan, then buy it, if not maybe this movie isn't for you."
1,So funny...but it's not supposed to be.,"The owner of the local video store gave us this movie. We had low expectations but would never have guessed this film would be so unintentionally hilarious. This is because this film has an the intoxicating mixture of being a toilet of a script AND it takes itself so seriously. As the lines escape the actor's mouths, my wife and I would fall off of the couch laughing while we begged them (in vain) to stop.File under ""gin movie"" ie: a film that one watches with no expectation of quality - on the contrary, the perceived poor quality requires imbibing in alcoholic beverages before hand in order to laugh the terrible experience off (and to loosen the lips so that peanut gallery comments can flow freely). If Mystery Science Theater 3000 should ever look to include relatively modern films, this would be a strong contender (not to mention a rich vein for comedy).I don't know how any of the participants could deliver these lines with a straight face."
3,This Movie Needs A Rewrite,"This movie starts out very promising, with vividly artistic shots following a classic boy meets girl story. The plot builds up as the main character tries to woo his mystery lady, and then falls flat on its face. Not to try to ruin the ending for those who haven't seen the movie yet, the writers' resolution is just not plausible. I don't want to give anything away - I'll just say that the movie is in serious need of a rewrite. It could have ended differently and have been more effective with the same outcome than what we are left with instead..... All that potential, down the drain.The first half is really good and sure to have you chuckling. Maybe forget about the second half....."
2,Needs captioning,"Captioning is a valuable service to provide for those of us who need it. In the film ""Miranda"" there is no English closed-captioning track, and the only concession to captions at all is the track in Spanish. I have noticed that British efforts are frequently released without captions, and in ""Miranda"" there are the usual modern faults: nearly inaudible whispering, inadequate separation between dramatic lines and accompanying music, British terms and pronounciations which Americans need to hear more accurately, and so forth. The use of Spanish subtitles does NOT help whatever in these matters. Otherwise, I do believe Christina Ricci is suitably admired by the photographer."
3,Photo Album,The photo album is pretty and delicate but you cannot acommodate vertical pictures vertically you have to place all pictures horizontally. I am little dissapointed at this since I had great expectations on this album.
4,very good product,"I really like this album,i boughted for my god doughter and it was the perfect gift.it really looks the same as in picture.i recommended."
3,My review of Scorpions' Acoustica,"Scorps were awesome as usual, but the backing female vocalists and the other musicians were totally unecessary. Klaus' voice is amazing and in no way needs any backing. A few songs were quite good (""Drive""- the Cars cover, ""Dust in the Wind""- Kansas cover--would've been much better w/o backing musicians). ""Rock You Like A Hurricane"" should not be done acoustically- ever. This is not for the faint of heart!"
1,A dissapointment,"Unlike other acoustic albums by great bands that enhance their reputations, Acoustica does nothing of the sort. With the exceptions of songs like ""Always Somewhere"" and ""Rhythm of Love"" the album leaves the listener wondering when good songs will begin."
2,My cat won't eat them anymore,"These used to be amazing, but they changed for the formula a while back and now my cat won't eat either flavor. Very disappointed."
5,My fingers are thankful,This little babies have saved my fingers from many puncture wounds. They are easy to use and the kitties all think they are getting treats rather than medicine. They even begged for them.
3,"Monkey see, monkey lost","I've read many Dummies books, and like the ""Monkey read, Monkey see, Monkey do"" approach. This monkey learns better when all the steps are clearly shown and executed in the text. Unfortunately, this book is more like ""Monkey read, Monkey lost"". For example, Chapter 4, ""Building a Database"". The author describes 2 sample databases then discusses the various operations (queries) that can be performed on the databases without detailed, step by step instructions along the way. With some trial and error, the steps can be deduced, but this can be very frustrating and may not always work.p.s.: Janet Valade has written several beginner books on PHP/MySQL. Maybe, eventually, she will get it right. She is so close..."
2,Disappointing,"I normally like the ""for Dummies"" series because I know that it'll start me out at ""zero"" knowledge and get me through to an understandable/workable level of the subject. PHP & MySQL for Dummies seems to think I'm a programmer who doesn't know html instead of the reverse, which I am. The author spends pages, pages and chapters telling the reader how to format syntax and characters without running through examples for the reader to replicate. I'm about halfway through the book now and hope to eventually run into those examples."
2,Least Helpful Book Ever,"I had a little experience with both PHP and MySQL before I bought this book. While the first few chapters make it seem easy enough, I found that using most of the information in the book - even copied letter for letter - led to error after error. Frustrated, I finally used my DREAMWEAVER textbook which, with as little information as it provides ABOUT both PHP and MySQL was a lot more helpful."
2,"Extremely confusing at times, leaps of logic","Picked this up after reading two worse books (there are many) and found the first explanations clear, possibly because I was already familiar with some of the terms.After the first two or three chapters, however, Valade gets complacent, doesn't explain minor issues which can leave you puzzled.The examples are not very useful and, although she explains some of the steps, she leaves out details. Again, confusing.The book has numerous errors, one which left me reading the same page for about half an hour. Rather than approaching the topic for beginners, she does assume some programming knowledge at time.After reading the explanations of object oriented programming (classes), I nearly gave up.The author is not a good teacher. There are scripts on her own web site with corrections."
2,OK but confusing...,Unfortunately the author of this book is so engrossed in her knowledge she isn't able to step back and tell the beginner (after all this is the Dummies guide) what to do step by step. She informs you 'about' PHP and MySQL with little comprehensive instruction on how to build a database website in a logical clear step by step order.Overall in my opinion this book is far from 'even a dummy can do it if they follow the steps' guide but more of a poor attempt by an expert to teach people a complex topic without the understanding of what is means to be a beginner.
1,I wouldn't recommend it.,"I own this book, personally I think its awful. The way it is structured doesn't seem to work too well for the purpose. I read the entire thing once and still felt like I knew nothing. I found some tutorials online easier to follow and the lack of working examples didn't help either. Perhaps if it we're written by a programmer and not a professional author it would have been easier to follow. It didn't help me much however you be the judge and read it for your self maybe you'll find it more useful."
2,No very thorough,I wanted to learn how to programme in php/mysql. This seemed to be a good book to start with. It does tell you all about the different things about php and mysql but it doesn't go into enough detail. The way the book works is it builds up into two projects. The first is to make a website that can register users. And the second is to make a online catalogue which the users can buy from. Thats all well and good. But I had no need to make these projects. I wanted to make my own specific project. Thats why I was learning php.As a result I had a hard time using this book. Specific stuff that is not important to the above projects was left out. Thus I had a hard time finishing my own project. I had search in several other books and websites so that I could finish my project. And my project was really not a complicated one. A simple questionnaire type form that then displays something depending on the number of points you score.
4,Works good.,"reasonable price, does whats its supposed to do although the lateral part of the machine is a bit off.. I would buy again"
5,A ghost story mingles with real-life challenges,"Graham and his sister know that their new home is haunted by soldiers from the past; but the past invades their new lives as their father is put on trial for a security breach and the family must adjust to shame and community judgement. Can lessons from the past affect their future in their new home? A ghost story mingles with real-life challenges, here."
2,What is it really,"When trying to order this product - it never shows the ingredients. So I'm expecting 100% Sea Buckthorn oil right? wrong! Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Fragrance (Parfum)*, Limonene*, Linalool*, Benzyl Benzoate*, Benzyl Salicylate*, Ceraniol*, citral*, famesol*taken directly from the box!"
2,caused contact dermatitis,"I put this on my shoulders, and next day my shoulders were all red with contact dermatitis. I must be allergic to something in the ingredients."
4,smells good,This product feels and smells good... like oranges. It is not 100% sea buckthron but the combination of oils helps sooth the skin. I would not use on my face but as a body oil it is sufficient.
4,Very Enjoyable,"I wizzed through this borrowed copy of ""Diary of a Witch"" in one day this summer. This is a delightful book that is well written and easy to read. I too have never read anything about witches or thier relgion wicca. It dispells (no pun intended!) any preconcieved notions, most of which are negative, you may have about witchcraft. Sybil certainly lead a very interesting life or she's a great story teller. Which ever way you look at it, if you are open minded I am sure you'll enoy this book."
4,This book is Fantastic,"This was the first book that I read that focused on witchcraft. I always learn something new each time I read it. If you're looking for a book about what it is like growing up in a family of witches, this is the one."
3,Living Waterfalls,"I expected the digital animation to be more life-like. I guess I've been spoiled by some of the beautiful aquarium programs. The menu is great. The images are lovely, but the nature sound track does not vary and the sounds of the waterfalls are almost secondary on the track."
2,I'm not sure what to think.,"The subtitle of this book is ""Scholarship, Policy, and Practice"" and this feels like something that is part-social work, part-therapy, and part-public policy. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing. Are too many cooks spoiling the soup? Perhaps this book is best for directors of Latino non-profits or governmental agencies in Latino communities. I particularly like the section of the book that focuses on specific populations; namely Latino fathers, and Central American refugee families. Too many books on Latinos stress the same old stuff (Latinos are diverse; their numbers are increasing; language and immigration will be an issue unlike with most blacks or whites, etc.). So this book was definitely trying to do something special. I just don't know if they effectively acheived their goal(s)."
2,Not sure the purpose of this basket?,"I bought this thinking it would replace my current skewers. When I opened up the gigantic package, all i seen was a gigantic basket. I was disappointed it didn't come with an actual skewer. The openings in the basket are about as thick as the openings in your grill grates so i don't know why you wouldn't just cook it on the grill grates? Maybe i am missing the boat with something but I do not see the point of having this gigantic basket. I am glad i only ordered 1 of them."
4,Power Dance Mix is Awesome,"This Cd incorporates a lot of dance classics from the 90's if you are a avid dance music fan this is the cd for you. It is a great cd to listen to anytime. I absolutely love it, and I can't stop listening."
1,Absolute rubbish,"I've given a rating of 1 star for this book only because negative numbers are not an option. If you think this book is entertaining, you should read ""Darkness in the Heart of El Dorado"" by Patrick Teirney and find out the real story behind Lizot. This man should be in jail!"
3,OK,"This is a fun activity, but I wish there were more of a variety of words. Capital letters are scarce."
1,Horrible Learning Experience,"Product came broken, the tiles are too small. Dangerous if children place these tiles in theri mouth, it does'nt matter what age! it's still dangerous. Some words are even faded! Overall horrible product. Don't buy!"
4,Fun while you Learn,"I bought these for my grandchildren when they come over. We try to make silly sentences with them. The almost 4 year old is starting to get the hang of it. I wish they had put magnets on the back of them. Other than that, I have no complaint."
2,Not the greatest,"I bought this stopper based on the reviews, but have to report that I do not agree with the positive comments. The strainer easily gets clogged when rinsing dishes, and the outside edge is thick, so small particles settle around it (instead of going into the strainer). I'm back to searching for a better one:)"
5,A must-have item for your kitchen,"We have been searching for a better alternative to the typical strainer. We love this one. It looks like it is flimsy, but it is not! It is so much cleaner and easier to use than the typical strainer."
4,Suspenseful,"This was the first Kellerman book that I read and I found it to be suspenseful and well written. Even though the plot was somewhat far fetched, he did an excellant job of pulling the story and the characters together. I enjoyed reading this book."
2,"Linear, Misogynistic, Anticlimactic","Kellerman has written a very shallow book. It is unfortunate, given his implied medical and clinical background, that he has invested such time and energy into such a typical and unoriginal story. The descriptions of the scenes and characters are mundane and transparent. His treatment of the women characters exploits the madonna/whore dyad which has been overplayed since the time of Homer. I was looking forward to a crystallized and entertaining relaxation book, more in the style of Crichton. Overall this book delivers very little."
5,I always love Kellerman,"However, I already had the book so I took it to the library and donated it to the used books."
4,Books,"This was actually a gift to a friend, but the author is awesome. I am now quite addicted to his books."
3,This is not Mr. Kellerman's normal work.....,"I've have been a huge fan of Mr Kellerman'swork for the longest time, but I have to say TheClinic seems to be one of those books that hedid just to fulfill his contract. It started like oneof his normal stories but went downhill from thereThe ending was not your typical Dr. Delawarenovel, and I type this with great disappointment.Maybe, and this pains me to say but, Maybe its time to put Dr. Delaware to rest. If not, thenmaybe don't be so prolific and put a little moreheart and soul like most of the previous novelswritten by Mr.Kellerman. Believe me this is nota slam on the author but its just to show my viewthat sometimes a little less is better than a lotmore.RegardsLou 1369 @ aol.com"
4,Captivating read!,"The ""'Clinic"" was the first novel I read by Jonathan Kellerman, but it won't be the last! I thought the Clinic was a fun read. Alex & Milo team up to solve the murder of the brilliant professor/author Hope Devane. The book unravels the real life of Hope Devane, and reveals a private life far removed from her public image. In unraveling Hope's 'private life', it takes us through twists and turns, many possible suspects, to reveal her killer. A fun, fast paced read. I really enjoyed it."
3,Not his best,"This book was entertaining (as all his books are) but I miss Alex Delaware's involvement with children. I think those are his best books, not just your run-of-the-mill average murder mystery, there's enough of those out there. I will continue to buy Kellerman books as soon as they come out but I really hope he goes back to what he knows best"
4,Just one question unanswered,"The Clinic is the first Kellerman book I have read. Just finished it, and am left wondering why Kellerman didn't follow up on the whereabouts of the doctor (Cruvic). Is there no justice for him? Overall, the plot had a steady pace and makes the reader want to know the next link in the chain of evidence/next character's role in the mystery. I look forward to the next Kellerman and would recommend The Clinic as a first-time crime/mystery read."
2,A disappointment,"Jonathan Kellerman's mysteries sell well and he's gotten some good reviews, at least that is what I recalled when my daughter gave me ""The Clinic"" recently. Unfortunately, the reputation does not translate for me into an enjoyable read. Lots and lots of talk, some of which could have been cut or put into exposition, bogs down the narrative. Some interesting psychological insights from Dr. Alex Delaware about the characters involved, but although some suspense is generated, the overall effect is more like a thud, rather than a splash. Kellerman apparently believes that each character must be described in considerable detail, but without providing any insights into the character through dialogue and action, the descriptions are useless. He also describes with some detail some of the settings. But again the writing is so, well, pedestrian that there is no evocative rush from the descriptions. Maybe Kellerman is better in other books. One hopes so."
1,Boring,"I've read two Delaware books and both I've had to skip several chapters in order to get to the end and FINISH the darn thing!I tried to skip to the last page, and I still have no idea who did it. A waste of my time."
3,Another Kellerman Murder with a Twist,This is an older Kellerman book...They always begin very interestingly and I thoroughly enjoy the character development...especially between Alex and Robin. However this story in particular ended abruptly and was a bit far fetched.
1,Heaven Spare Us!,"A completely unbelievable cast yet exotic cast of villains and victims; then for balance a totally believable and horrendously boring, dull, dumb, and anticlimactic hero. (Somehow the writer believes this will make his story both exciting and believable.) Yet it makes for a completely unbelievable and completely boring story.If you're looking for detective fiction I have two recommendations from either side of the spectrum. First F Paul Wilson's Repair Man Jack series (This is Self Appointed officer of Justice-actually an outlaw in New York City fighting for his own ideals of justice.) If you don't like the dark intensity then try the other side of the spectrum: Sir Arthur Conan Doyal's Sherlock Holmes series. This is very loose and detatched put it down and pick it up whenever you want; the joy of this is just watching the brilliant observations unfold."
1,Slow and without any suspense,"The Clinic features Alexander Delaware, who endlessly inverviews victims and possible suspects. Being slow and boring, the Clinic makes great bed-time reading if you normally have a hard time getting to sleep."
3,Breezy Summer Fare,"Kellerman's education and experience in psychology help make his characters, and especially his villains, more believable and engaging.This one is pretty interesting. The hero, Alex Delaware, seems to have no psychology practice obligations other than doing detective/police-procedural work for Milo Sturgis. That's just fine, but it makes Delaware's character seem more unremarkable and superficial. The criminal's reasoning for perpetrating his mayhem and his modus operandi are only moderately convincing.This book is 3/5 stars because it's fun with a few minor hangups. It can easily be put down and picked up again, and you won't get any goosebumps or harrowing realizations from the plot."
2,Eh.....,I simply love the Alex Delaware series by Jonathan Kellerman. I usually read a book in 2-3 days. This books was different for me. The pacing seemed off and I really just never got into the story. Early on it was clear I really didn't care about the main victim. I soon became bored enough that I had trouble remembering who was who because I wasn't involved enough to pay attention. Milo always amuses me so the book got 2 stars. I'm hoping the next book is much better.
3,The weakest of the Rats trilogy,This is the second and the weakest of the Rats trilogy. Domain being the best (absolutely incredible novel) and Rats being a very good beginning to this nightmare.
5,lair,good condition. follow up to the rats. leaves you fearful of rodents and the possibility of an intelligent rodent
1,RUN....... RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN FROM THIS PURCHASE !!!!!!!,"My title for the review says it all....... my copy was broken when I ordered it so I have to be thankful for that because I could return it. I AM sorry I found someone who had one for me to borrow - yes, they WARNED me this was possibly THE WORST ""THING"" EVER MADE (I cannot stress that line ENOUGH)..... no acting, sound, picture quality AT ALL. Geez, I can't spend the time it would take for me to type all the BAD things I want to say about this so in short, HA HA HA..... joke will be on you for wasting your money if you purchase this."
4,3 year old approved,"My daughter loves this movie. She follows along with the stories. It's educational and fun. It doesn't drive me crazy, which is nice."
1,Does not do what it is supposed to,I own two of these and they will soon see the garbage. These do not clip evenly across a bag of chips. I closed a family sized bag of chips and picked it up by the clip. Luckily I was fast enough to catch the falling bag of chips. I did not pick it up by the part that opens and closes it. I tried a clip half of it's size that I have been using for awhile. I picked up the same bag of chips by that smaller clip and it stayed clipped to the chip bag. I even carried it around to my computer room and back and it stayed attached protecting my chips. Stale chips taste lousy. Avoid this clip as it need some quality built into it. 1 Star max.
2,A Boring Series,"Alba spends most of her time building plastic models. One day, after her Grandmother dies, she is kidnapped by a cross-dressing man. He takes her to a base where she becomes the pilot of a mecha called a Jinki. Alba fights to save humanity.This anime is pretty boring. I realized about 7 episodes into the series that all these battles that took place for no reason. There is no clear enemy. It's like a child playing with with toy soldiers. There is no point to anything that happens in this series. The good guys and bad guys have no goals or allegiances. It seems like they have a simple code: ""Wow! Another mecha, lets blow it up!"" They simply fight for the hell of it. The animation is average, the voice acting is pretty good, and the soundtrack is okay. Nothing important happens in this series. It just kinda exists. I can't recommend it. It's a serious bore."
2,Read before buying this book for a preteen!,"The title, including the word ""girl"" and the artwork led me to think this would be a great present for my eleven-year-old granddaughter who lives in Australia. I got the book home and began reading. The word ""prostituion"" appeared in chapters one and two. A later chapter discussed the girl pirates as having ""sexual relations"" aboard ship. I'm not a blue stocking, but I didn't know if my granddaughter's mom was ready for the questions that might ensue. I gave the book to my 45-year-old daughter and bought puppets to send to the granddaughter and her younger brothers in Australia."
2,Missing Footage Trick,"I, too, bought this for nostalgiac purposes only to be befuddled. My copy is divided into 3 parts, possibly each being a separate 'Saturday' segment. Part 1 is fully there. Both Part 2 and 3 abruptly end 10 to 15 minutes into the episodes without showing the conclusions! Very disappointed.**UPDATE** Selecting 'Play All' will show the entire video and its contents. Selecting each part separately for some reason does not show each episode in its entirety. Weird, but now I'm happy! 3 stars"
3,This was a good movie,"This was an interesting movie. not what was expecting, but still good. I thought it would be would be more of a movie when the kids had to help the green people save there home from the forces of evil. but it was really teaching the green people to get out more and not have to learn things from comic books all the time. The movie was OK and I like the lesson they teach us, because it is important to get out and explore the world and not relay on TV and comic books so much."
2,A disappointing curiousity,"What started off as an interesting insight into the process of a well respected filmmaker working with students in a true master class process dissolved quickly into a rambling discussion about anything but the process of cinematography.Sure there were moments of hope when Lassally would touch on an element of framing or composition but then he would ""wax poetic"" about things that, I'm sure were important to him at the time but, were hardly relevant to what is pitched as the intent of the film: cinematography.From an aesthetic point of view, the images of the rock sculptures that populate the film have a symbolic meaning...perhaps. But from a practical perspective where one would want to expose students to the thought processes of a master filmmaker practicing his craft, this film was a disappointment."
5,Love scenes left me sweating.,"I really enjoyed this book as it had most of what I like in a romance novel: a really hot couple (acutally it had two hot couples), ultra sensual love scenes that I nearly needed a shower after reading, and a bittersweet tale of long lost love redeemed, as well as a modern story of jungle fever.Ms. Lee really knows how to tell a tale of love lost regained. I nearly cried with joy at the end when the ""other"" couple finally found peace with each other.There are paranormal elements in the book including an absolutely delicious vampire I can't wait to read more about. This is my first book by Ms. Lee, but it won't be my last."
1,Save your money..,"I purchased this e-book after someone's glowing review. I was highly dissapointed. The concept was OK, a talisman being passed on to 2 descendants of long-ago lovers and now they are both having eroic feelings about each other. The heroine is black and the hero is white which makes their relationship more complicated. Sounds good? Maybe - except that the writing is mediocre and the sex scenes not sensual or erotic at all. The heroine is not likeable and the secondary characters are just as shallow. Can't recommend this to anybody. If you like to read good quality romantica , try all of Jaid Black's book from EC. She's so far the best writer they have."
3,It was okay.,"It was just okay for me. Something was missing and it was off in spots. I feel like it was a rushed story. No real plot or character development. For a $1 and some change though, I won't complain too much:)"
4,DIVA'S ZONE,"What a novel concept. I was glad that the real story came out. Our future couple truly wanted and loved each other, but their plantation family, what a pair. The truth came out that he was not a trustworthy or loving man... Oh well...."
3,Runs small,"Other mediums by this maker fit fine. This medium is a little tight. My hope is with wear it will stretch and let blood flow back to my fingers again... Obviously this skews ratings, but...for what it's worth."
